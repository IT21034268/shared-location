3,Mixed Blessing!,"This book is certainly effective for improving your math skills;however,it is dissapointingly poor for developingyour verbal skills.I can say that its math questions are down-to-earth,which provides an authentic quantitative enviromentfor students.On the other hand,practice questions in the verbal section are pieces of cake when compared to real SAT questions.They do not reflect the authentic verbal questions.They are relatively short and simple.As for the Cd ROM, it is full-featured and helps students discover their strengths and weaknesses.In short,buying this book is neither a waste of money nor an extraordinary profit"
2,WARNING!,"WARNING, WARNING! This book has only lyrics, i.e., no music. Rating given on basis of disappointment over this discovery. Apart from that it is an excellent volume, firmly bound - library quality, carols grouped by their themes, vast variety and number."
3,Doesn't cover the new Functions and Commands,"I was looking for an update book that would cover the new @Functions and @Commands in the programming language. I saw them listed in the first chapter, browsed through the other chapters and saw the real-world code examples and purchased the book. I was very disappointed to see only R5 code in the bulk of the book, even when new @functions in R6 could have been used to simplify. This is just a rushed rehash of the R5 text with new screenshots of R6 Designer client. I should have saved my money and gone with the IBM Redbook and the Lotus help documentation."
2,Almost a copy of the Domino Designer 6 Redbook,"Though I didn't buy this book I read the example pages here at Amazon.com and I compared it with the Domino Designer 6 Handbook from the Redbook series and all I must say it is almost a copy of it. The only difference are the ""RealWord""-Code Examples, but beyond that it is one of the many books telling you who to create a form, who to use fields etc. I would be interested in anybody's review who has this book to know if it is for advanced developers or if it is - as I think - for beginners. The authors have written good books I own and publish in many reference magazines but it is no garantee that every book has the same level. l could recommend this book to beginners who want to see some code examples."
3,Great if you're a programmer,"If you're trying to learn Lotus Notes, don't bother with this book. Especially if you're a new administrator and you just want to manage databases. I didn't find it very useful at all and had to purchase other books to get what I really needed. I find the Lotus Help feature gives you better information than this did."
5,This is a great book.,Debbie Lynd and Steven Kern know their stuff. This book is well written and detailed just enough. They key into exactly what is needed to move to and explore Lotus Notes R6. I highly recommend it and only wish I would have bought an autographed copy.
1,BIG waste of money!,These teaspoons are overtly cheap and flimsy... I intended to return them but due to high shipping costs I just tossed them! Don't waste your money!
5,Mature tropicalia at its best. Political and passionate!,"Released in the 70's this is the album to listen to and enjoy the cultural, political and artistic atmosphere of Brazil under its dictatorial cloud. Faca amolada! A sharp knife cutting through the heart of the Brazilian People. Poetical, sensual and absolutely honest. The lyrics and rythms will stay in you mind and heart forever. The songs can be also romantic and full of passion only lovers in danger can feel... Have a listen!"
2,The best of Bahia doing Brazil,"This album is the love child of the tour four of the Best Brazilian artists ever went in throughout 1976.Caetano Veloso,Maria Bethania,Gal Costa ,Gilberto Gil;their names speak for themselves.They got together,wrote together,sang together.""Um Indio"" is taken by Bethania to stratospheric levels,""Eu te amo"" is caressed and given birth to by Gal's unique voice.Gil's craft lies in unconsciously finding common ground between reggae,rock and Bahia's own rhythms.To top it all off,Caetano's writing and sweet tenor voice wraps up this unusual yet unmatched product.Talent ....talent....talent"
4,First material from Eva Remington's diaries,"Here's a biography that will interest the artist's fans. It explores the extent to which Remington's Eastern roots and his determined and independent wife influenced his work.Remington was a man of large appetites who, in spite of a pampered childhood, spotty academic career and a few business failures, established a solid reputation with his sketches. He then went on to worldwide acclaim for his bronzes and paintings.The authors are the first to have access to Eva Remington's diaries, which provide new insight into the life of this great artist of the American West."
5,Excellent book,"This book was a great book. I could completely identify with the author and all the people she interviewed for the book. If there is anyone out there who has gone on diet after diet, and your weight has yo-yoed up and down, you should read this book. It is a great comfort and a great book to read over and over.It was nice to know so many people know how I feel and understand my plight to diet."
3,Very eloquently and convincingly documented,"""Her Story: Women in Christian Tradition"" was written to redress the history of women in Christianity. She noted that traditionally, the focus has always been on the successes and failures of the male side of the Christian community. Eclipsed in those accounts were the significant stories of women, their roles and episcopal status, and how they converge with cultural undertones and the emerging epistemological frames of feminism and American religion. She explores this by tracing how the study of women, in Christianity, has developed through the ages. In this respect, she seeks to rewrite ""His"" story by telling ""Her"" story."
1,"Terrible, bipolar, not worth a dime",Okay now this I can write an epistle on. Was anticipating at least a moderate level of quality but this collection is just poor quality in every aspect and the bipolar arrangement on the cd doesnt help either. I really want my money back. The song collection itself is amazing the delivery or interpretation just isnt up to tolerance standard. much less enjoyment.
4,Mott The Gooseberry Sessions,Great CD of released and unreleased songs by Mott. I love Mott The Hoople and glad that when they had to break up that Mott carried on. They are underrated in my opinion. The 2 Lps they did are excellent. This CD shows how diverse they could be and even funny. Drive On!
3,Mott - 'The Gooseberry Sessions & Rarities' (Cleopatra) 3 1/2 stars,"Pretty much aimed toward the die-hard fans and completists. May not necessarily appeal to all / most Mott The Hoople fans. The way I read it was that Mott is a post-Mott The Hoople project. Personally, I thought that this 'The Gooseberry Sessions & Rarities' twenty-two track serves it's purpose well. Personnel: Pete Overend Watts - guitar & vocals, Nigel Benjamin - vocals, Ray Majors - guitar, Morgan Fisher - keyboard & vocals and Dale Griffin - drums. So, Mott has like two original Mott The Hoople members and one player who joined the band a bit later on 1972's 'All The Young Dudes' lp? Not a bad pick."
3,Interesting,"I'm not usually a fan of cover songs, but I picked this up one day and bought it, and I have to say that a few of the songs I prefer in this form. My most favorite has to be When the Lights Go Down. I can still appreciate it when sung by Faith Hill, but I think there's a whole new dimension to this song on this CD. I recommend that everyone try this CD."
1,IMP is a travesty to our children and our future,"I cannot believe the poor quality of this program. My daughter has always been an A student in math, and this series has had her struggling - because the teaching method is ridiculous. I decided to buy her a ""normal"" math book as a supplement, and she is doing very well studying that book on her own. I wish we could move out of the area so my daughter could have a regular math class instead of these classes. It's really sad to see. I think the math teachers that devised this method were looking for busy work, and came up with this crap."
5,Awsome Collection!,"Top pop artists redo some of their hits as soda commercials. However the best part is the stuff between the songs. Bits of the actual radio broadcasts: news, weather, disc jockeys, etc. It really take you back to another era. Wish it had more of this. At any rate - an outstanding collection!"
5,Great,I really like this bag. It cleans up really easily and I plan to get more sizes. It was nice to put disposable bags inside for a camoflauge effect.
5,thank you,i bought these for my daughter for Christmas. she was very excited to get started with decorating cakes and cupcakes. thank you.
5,Pastry Bags,":-) :-) :-) What more can I say, I love these bags. It's a great size when you need to do a large cake or fill cannolis."
4,Great product!,"I paid for Ateco Plastic Coated Decorating Bag, 18-Inch. The item has shipped incredible fast! The product is great can hold a lot of frosting."
5,Can't be without them!,Durable plastic coated pastry bags...just can't be without them. Use them in many sizes.
3,Good buy.,These were priced right and very durable. I use this size for large scale production and I have 2 smaller ones for fine work. They clean up well and are stain resistant.
5,Great buy,"This is a great find, I have been looking for these scissors for about a year and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon, and at a great price. Super!"
3,Mundial BP1860-1 CushionSoft 8-1/2-Inch Dr...,"I cut one segment of fabric from a pattern that had 9 segments to cut, and gave the pair to my 9 and 6 year old great grandchilren to use ... since I am trying to teach them to sew.Of course, my pair may not be true of all these scissors, but I would recommend a pair of fiskar scissors from Walmart which would be about the same price. I say fiskars because the fabric shop down the street use a pair of fiskars to cut the lengths of fabric they sell ... although they also have the same Mundial scissor for sale hanging on their wall display."
3,Very kitschy!,"I bought a couple copies for graduation gifts, just to be silly. I also bought one for myself, and I send a postcard whenever I wish I had the time and resources to take a road trip across America. It's not your normal postcard book!"
1,Beast,"This is an extreme fantasy for those heavily into bondage, leather, and S/M. It is the second in a series by the same author. For those looking for erotica in the positive sense of mutual temptation, pleasure and excitement, this is not it."
2,Beast,I couldn't get into this book. S/M is fine with me but the plot was nothing and the abuse was too much. In reality noone could withstand this kind of pain. I then to think the author tried to make out like that got such pleasure from this beast. Also books that just beat over and over again get boring.
2,READ MY REVIEW,"I LIKE COARSE LANGUAGE AND KINK, THIS BOOK DID NOT DO IT FOR ME.THE DUNGEON SLAVE SET UP IS COOL BUT THE REST WAS NOT AROUSING TO ME. IF YOU ARE AROUSED BY WORDS LIKE ""ARSE"" AND ""FLANKS"" AND SQUASHING BUTTERFLIES AND SMUSHING THEIR BODIES AROUND OR USING MOSQUITOS TO FEAST ON PEOPLE, THAN GO FOR IT. I FOUND IT ACTUALLY A TURN OFF."
5,Paula West is a true Star,"I first had the pleasure of listening to the wonderful Paula West at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco, then later, Dempsey's Cabaret, and the Plush Room. I was an immediate fan. I have enjoyed her first two cds, wearing them out with constant play. This new offering, Come What May, is by far the best. She is truly a talent that stands up to the likes of, Ella Fitzgereld, and Billie Holliday. Paula West should be remembered as one of the great Jazz performers of all time. And if enough people listen to this wonderful new cd, I believe she will."
4,Early Paula,"This was a replacement CD. When I found my original was lost, I had to have it! These are classic songs with beautiful arrangements sung very well by Ms. West. She's improved over the years, but these are gems to be enjoyed over and over again."
3,Paula West has great voice. CD just didn't move me.,"Paula West has a wonderful voice. She deserves a long and successful career. It's probably a personal matter; but I didn't care for most of the material on this CD. While most of the songs are considered classics, they are the kind that appeal more to the intellect than to the heart.The one song that I really did like was the last, ""I Remember You."" It created a mood of late-night reverie where the only thing missing was Bogart and Bacall kissing goodbye under a flickering streetlight."
5,The best Live Sweet Home Performance Ever,I have 21 Synyrd Albums and if you like them live you have to buy this one. I has been hard to get for years. Free Bird and Sweet Home are the best they ever performed (mostly because of the unbelievable improve guitar work). If you know a Skynyrd fan they won't be disappointed.
2,Annoying! very short episodes!,"Dejeiko is so incredibly annoying that it makes this almost unwatchable.In super short episodes. She makes new friends pretending to be a regular girl and not the princess. her mission is to make people happy, but she's so obsessed with being a good girl and doing the right thing that you want to smack her. The redeeming part then comes in with, of course, a devil. Piyoko, a normal girl who works with the devil to try and ruin dejeiko's day. You can't help but love her and want her to succeed. The failing characteristic of this series IS dejeiko. I'd suggest you wait until the first season is released- yes Dejeiko is still there along with her little side kick and this time they are both bad,but still annoying -BUT, Rabi~en~Rose is the best character and she alone makes it worth viewing."
3,Works. When you can get it to connect.,"I don't know if it was my phone or this adapter, but it was very hard to get them to connect to one another especially if you were connecting to another device as well."
1,Maxell DSR-2,"I bought this refill kit without owning the main kit that the refills go into. I have been unable to find the main kit. Therefore, I cannot give this product a fair review, other than it sits unused right now."
5,Great Information/ Great Book,"Mark Thompson is a excellent author that tells things how they are. He does not ""sugar coat"" life on the lakes or about the Great lakes Shipping industry. If you want a easy to read truthful acount of Great Lakes Shipping then this is the book for you."
5,"Erudite, Difficult, Worthwhile","A prolific and knowledgeable scholar who left us much too soon, Gunton offers here the best of his many studies of a basic Christian doctrine. Though the experts continue to debate this point or that in Gunton's analyses, this book remains indispensable on a subject of critical importance in Christian theology."
4,Great for the not too computer and digital camera savvy,I got this as a gift for my mom. She loves it. She doesn't do the digital camera and digital frame gadgets. With this frame she can keep changing pictures of her cute grandbaby.
5,dit dit dit -dah dah- dit dit dit / ... --- ... / S-O-S,"A lone wolf cries out from the wilderness, but who is listening?Everyone should be, but the message is just too hard to stomach for most humans.Well written, clear, and scientifically supported, this book is worth reading if for no other reason than to see how our Earthship has been holed and is sinking."
4,Wow! Lori Foster has caught my attention once again!,"Let me begin by saying that I love reading contemporary romances. And when I find an author I adore, I tend to read anything and everything they produce. I had been floundering away, though, from Ms. Foster's books lately. Moreover, I usually take a couple of weeks to read a book because I have very little time to read. However, from page 1 of this book I was hooked. Wihtin one day I had read half the book. I couldn't put it down. In one word the beginning of this book is HOT!!!!!!!!!Yes, somewhat playful at the beginning, I kept laughing at how hard Jude was trying to get May's attention. The harder he tried the more she seemed uncomfortable and turned on. Let me just say that even I found it hard not to fall for Jude right away. I don't know what exactly it was that made this book different, but I haven't been so hooked since ""Too Much Temptation"". Believe me, once you start reading this book, you won't put it down!"
2,not great,"The story between the main characters (Jude and May) was good. However, unnecessary plot twist and characters made this a very boring read."
2,Are these people reading the same book here?,"I used to like to read anything of Lori Foster's, however, the last few books she's put out seemed to have been rushed through. There is no chemistry between the two main characters. Jude is a little too good to be true. I thought the more interesting story was of her brother and his ""teacher"". The characters were not very well thought out."
5,Great read!,"This is a great book and its best if you also get ""Murphy's Law"", as the main two characters of the sequel are introduced in ""Jude's Law"". If you are a fan of Lori Foster, you will not be disappointed. The characters seem to come alive before your eyes. It's a real page turner."
5,law,in this book jude is hot for the gallery owner he buys all his art from but when some dangerous men come knocking what starts out as a strained friendship turns into a full out ramantic maze with twists and turns that keep you inthralled till the verry end and when you have finally put it down you find yourself reaching for the next book id recomend this to anyone seeking romance thrill and major plot twists
4,"A good read, but...","Lori Foster is hit or miss for me, but this one was more enjoyable than some. It had some excellent tension and sizzle, but it lagged in a few spots. Also, I felt we were hit over the head with her weight issues again and again. I remember the word ""jiggle"" (or a variation of the word) being used repeatedly. It really detracted from the story. I prefer authors to establish that the heroine is not pencil-thin, then carry on with the story. This is really a 3.5, rounded up to 4."
3,A little slow to start.....,"It took me awhile to get into the story. I then thoroughly enjoyed the plot and sex scenes. However what was that ending? It left me hanging. Guess I have to go buy ""Murphy's Law"" to fulfill my curiosity."
1,Couldn't hold my attention....plot/dialogue is blah,"Contemporary romance isn't my usual fare (I prefer romantic historicals), but after reading a pretty good Foster story in one of the anthologies, I figured I'd give this a try. Wrong! The writing is certainly 'dumbed down' and dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. And don't get me started on the plot. A supposedly gorgeous actor practically has to beg the mousey heroine to have sex with him? Yeah right! The love scenes are awkwardly written as well. The brother is a complete idiot. The best friend is the only one I cared about. She was interesting, but her romantic story line was left hanging -obviously setting up a sequel. ARGH! I maybe tempted to get that one out of sheer curiosity. This one just left me blank."
2,A big let down,"I usually enjoy Lori Foster novels, but this book was such a disappointment. The plot was not well developed at all. I expected so much more at the end of the story, but the supposed ""main event"" went by in the blink of an eye and then the book was over. I was not impressed by the story of the two main characters, it was too rushed. I was more interested in the story line involving the best friend of the main female character. From the book it is obvious that she will soon have a story of her own. Hopefully, it will be better than this one."
3,"OK read, but nothing close to 5 stars, especially after reading","her protégé Erin McCarthy's latest book. The pupil out-writes the master to an embarrassing degree, IMHO.Personally, I found Unexpected the only book LF has published in the last couple of years to be worthy of more than 3 stars. I was hoping she was heading more in that direction. Her fan base is so large that I guess she doesn't have to/dare change her formula - in this scenario, an author's writing won't grow or evolve, so the fan base will be the original fans who want to read the same book, in essence, over and over. Throw in a by the numbers love scene, some sappy love lines spoken or thought by the syrupy smitten, white bread characters, and voilà, no more effort needed, apparently. *snore*"
3,Disappointed,"I tried to read it, but I just couldn't finish. The writing was good, but I can't read another eyeglass wearing fat girl who has one of the most gorgeous guys practically begging her to have sex with him. I couldn't even read the sex scenes for going eewww. Just nothing appealing about the lead female character. Basically, the attraction between the hunky, sexy man and the overweight unattractive female turned me off."
1,don't waste your time,"What a piece of garbage. Stupid plot, innane charachters,and poor writing style. Can I think of anything good to say about this book.....Nooooo!!!!!!"
2,Didn't connect with this one,"I feel like I read a different book than everyone else. I have read many, many Lori Foster books and have enjoyed most of them. I just didn't care for this one. It reminded me of an earlier book she wrote with an overweight heroine and overbearing hero, but I remember enjoying that one much more. With this one, I got tired of the weight comments. Either the heroine was OK or not OK with her weight--which one is it? She would say she was fine with her weight, but then compared herself (unfavorably) to Uma Thurman. I was also thoroughly sick of the hero by the middle of the book. He was too controlling for me! He treated this heroine like a baby--not a grown woman--ugh! Finally, the storyline was just too farfetched to be believed. Sorry too be so negative--I'll stop now."
1,Useless and full of psycho-babble garbage,"It's not just that this book is written horribly (it's nothing but extreme excerpts from people who've obviously made therapy their personal hobby). It's not just that this book fails to offer actual constructive ideas about dealing with trust issues (although it does explain, ad nauseum, all the ways you might see trust issues). The real problem is that it sounds like the most old-school, formulaic psycho-babble you could possible imagine.In a nutshell, here's what this book will tell you: 1. it's all because of your parents and 2. it's all because of your gender. Helpful? NO!I really have no idea where all the good reviews on this book are coming from. Seriously, if I didn't have such extreme trust issues, I'd wonder if the author didn't pay a couple of his friends to drop Amazon a note..."
2,Over simplified and bland,"The book description says simplified for western kitchens, this is very true, too true in fact.I have made many recipes in this book yet they all seem to taste fairly bland and same. Everything seems like a different combination of onion, garlic, ginger, chilli, shrimp paste, coconut milk and a few spices. Throughout the book it also refers to ground galangal, lemongrass and tumeric but never says if its fresh or dried, just a tad of an oversight!!!It is a simple to follow book, but none of the recipes taste particularly authentic or anything like other indonesian cookbooks. However for an easy rijstaffel it would be good as many recipes can be made very quickly as most recipes have so many similar ingredients. I recommend 'the best of indonesian cooking' by Yasa Boga or culinaria south east asia for some great indonesian cooking, both may be a bit more involved but the results are so much better than this book has to offer."
1,This fit like GLOVE WITH SIX FINGERS,"I ordered this product for a 2006 Dodge Magnum, ""remember custom fit"". When It arrived it was for several autos, including a Dodge Magnum. I installed the liner and It didn't come close to fitting. I called the manufacturer for more information about their product, they informed me it was the wrong liner and gave me the correct number for my car. I sent the liner back to Amazon with the correct number, paying return postage. A week later I recieved the same liner I sent back, so I refused the shipment. No such thing as a CUSTOM FIT........"
4,A Lush mix,"This single is an interesting one for the loyal Lush listener, starting off with 500 (Shake Baby Shake), rolling into a couple of rare acoustics, I'd Like to Walk Around In Your Mind and Kiss Chase, and finishing with the ""hexadecimal dub mix"" of Last Night. That version of Last Night is worth the disc alone. It's not one of Lush's better singles, but it's not bad."
4,"Some really good songs, and some very cheesy commercial tunes","It is very difficult to review this album without mentioning that the single ""What Have You Done"" is the wrong choice for a choice track off this album. I would have chosen ""The Howling"" or the title track ""The Heart of Everything."" There are some very epic songs on this album, perhaps four or five. However, the rest of the album suffers greatly from simplistic lyrics and riffs that are catchy in a bad way. The MTV crowd will eat up ""What Have You Done"" but those looking for good symphonic metal will love ""The Howling"" and ""The Truth Beneath the Rose."" This is barely heavy metal, but half of the album is really good, so I will give it four out of five stars."
5,"wt, wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","sharon sings like an angel. wt is proof american radio is keeping some of the best bands in the world from us!!!!!!!!! john in sparks,nevada. ps buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Go Back To Silent Force,"While I will admit it did disappoint me, if giving a chance this CD still rises above a lot of the other filth people are putting out these days (Evanesces to name one, even at her worse on this CD Sharon Den Adel still sings circles around Amy Lee (if you could sing in circles anyways)). The Howling was amazing a good start for the CD but then What Have You Done lays the disappointment on thick. I have noticed a lot of people don't like Frozen but personally I think it is a great song. Our Solem Hour is more reminiscent of Silent Force and all in all a good song. Heart Of Everything is also a great song and Cross is also good the rest is very medium to low quality when compared to Silent Force. Most of the time it failed to catch my attention. Still the CD grows on me so maybe one day I will love the CD but never will it surpass the greatness of Silent Force or the beauty of Mother Earth."
4,Heavier than Silent Force,"Very good album. A little heavier sounding than their Silent Force album that I have, but equally good."
5,Within Temptation: The Heart of Everything,Excellent band and possibly the best in their genre. Vocals and sympohinic elements practicly unrivaled. A must have for metal enthusiasts.
5,My first WT album.,I bought this a few months ago and it was immediatly one of my favorite albums. THe sonwrting and musicianship on this album is unspeakably wonderful.
4,A very good album,I personally liked the album a lot. Some people say its to much like Evanescence but I believe that its the opposite and Evanescence is trying to mimic this group. I would definitely rate it equal with or better than Evanescence album Open Door. If your a fan of Evanescence or NightWish I strongly recommend this album.
5,A great album for anyone:D,There are so few words to describe how amazing this cd is and how amazing she is as an artist. Every song on this album is great and you can listen to it over and over again. If you like her other cds then you will really love this one.
4,"Excellent quality, digitally and musically",The songs are downloaded but they still sound CD-quality. I recommend this band to anyone who enjoys Evanescence and I recommend downloading music from Amazon.
3,BEWARE: More rock than metal,"I bought this album with much enthusiasm, and yet I found nothing but pop-friendly rock songs reminiscent of Evanescence.Now don't get me wrong, Evanescence is a great band, and this is a good album, but what happened to the old Within Temptation? Their first album was their best one in my opinion. Even though it saddened me to see them take a new direction in their next albums, at least it was still unique. In contrast, this album sounds like Celine Dion with guitars in the background. It still sounds good, but I personally like metal more than rock.If you like female-fronted rock bands then by all means buy this album, you will not be disappointed. However, if you're more into Gothic Metal I recommend you buy Within Temptation's first album ""Enter"", it's more melancholic and poetic in my opinion. You may also want to check out other bands such as Theatre of Tragedy (their first three albums), Tristania, Sirenia (first two albums), The Sins of Thy Beloved, and Penumbra."
2,Unimpressive pop music,"Unfortunately, like Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation has given in to the ... temptation (sorry, I had to) of making pop music that the masses will swarm to and just as quickly leave for the next thing. The songs I heard were completely forgettable. Lots of smash, crash, boom. No music. Granted, Sharon's vocals are more spectacular than ever. Not even a hint of the imperfection of the prior albums.I saw them with Lacuna Coil a few weeks ago, and the songs they played off this album simply slid right through my head, and left me even more eager to get to their absolutely wonderful finale, the Mother Earth/Ice Queen combination. It was great to hear these songs played by a tighter, more mature band, with Sharon's voice at the level it has reached now. Stunning!"
2,How this band has fallen!,"Its hard to believe this is the same group that created the amazing album ""Mother Earth"". I had to keep checking the liner notes to make sure I had the right band. WTF happened? After the slightly disappointing ""Silent Force"" album I hoped they would get back on track. I now appreciate how good Silent Force was. Oh well, I'm off to the used record store to get rid of this mess."
4,great CD,"This is a great CD. ""Frozen"" is my favorite track off of it but I really like ""What Have you Done"" too. The lyrics are really good and it is heavier than ""Mother Earth."" I don't like it has much as ""Silent Force"" but almost."
5,Amazing album,"I purchased this album from itunes after hearing a couple of the 30 second clips. This cd is amazing, very theatrical, very epic. Sharon's voice is absolutely beautiful/haunting. I was so pumped about this cd that I ordered their Silent Force cd from amazon. While I recommendThe Silent Force, its nowhere near as great as The Heart of Everything. A must buy."
4,"purchased because of ""All I Need""","I purchased this cd because it has the song ""All I Need"" which was on the show Vampire Diaries. They left it off their soundtrack which was a mistake in my opinion so I bought this and I really enjoyed some of the other songs as well. I am sad to say I had never heard of them before I heard that song."
5,Reading the Psalms through a new Lens,"Reading the Psalms can become a routine part of daily prayer life. In ""Psalms for a Pilgrim People"", I have found the Psalms brought alive in a way that reflects my Christian experience.In this book, Jim Cotter preserves the beauty and poetry of the text, and also manages to use language and images that are meaningful to contemporary life. He adds prayers and meditations that bring the words of the Old Testament in to focus through the lens of the life and teaching of Jesus."
4,Makes a great gift for a father-to-be,"I have the older copy of this book for myself. I am ordering a copy of the latest edition for my brother-in-law (my Sister's Husband). It has practical advice, and many unique ideas. It is told in a straight forward, non-judgemental manner. Good luck to all Father's out there."
5,"With this many 5 star reviews, how can you go wrong?","No other word can describe this band other than AMAZING. Buy it, put it in your DVD player, watch and listen, and then you'll find yourself doing it again and again. This is the one DVD in your colection that you will watch more than once. It's already been said in these reviews, but Blue October is life changing music. Justins' lyrics put into words, all those feelings and emotions that many of us find impossible to express. His lyrics actually mean something. They aren't just cool words that go along well with a good hook. Just buy it...and then share it with everyone you know, and the see how their music will never leave your cd player or Ipod"
2,just OK,"This book seemed very familiar to me, perhaps beause I read it when it was first released 20 years ago, or more likely because this storyline has been told before in countless other romance novels. I found it to be dated, with a domineering and chauvanistic leading man who is a master at manipulating the woman he wants. She's not as strong as she tries to come across, and lots of annoying verbal sparring passes between them, making the book kind of stressful to read. I usually savor treasured early novels written by current mainstream authors, and I generally love to read Sandra Brown's books, but this one really didn't capture my interest or my heart."
4,Deke got under my skin,"The character of Deke really got under my skin. He comes in and takes over Laney's life like he owns her. The fact that she falls in love with him, makes it worse. He is so possesive and expects her to run her life according to his rules.The fact that this got to me so much, shows that Sandra Brown has a great writing ability. Although I hated the character of Deke, I simply couldn't put the book down. I read it in under two days!.I suggest all women read this. It's a good read. It'll probably teach you which men to avoid too! lol."
2,Obviously of another era,"The story was the typical boy meets girl. Boy is captivated and pursues until girl gives in. Well written but very early writing for Sandra Brown. No surprises, just lovely romance."
2,Dated Romance Book,"Today I finished the audio version of ""Words of Silk,"" which was my first Sandra Brown book. I don't know what I was expecting, but I hadn't expected this book to have so much sex and so little plot. I realized shortly after starting this book, that it was written in the 80's and I did find it to be very dated. I didn't care much for the leading characters, Deke and Laney -- Deke was so controlling, almost to the point of being annoying.. and Laney was weak, almost to the point of being pathetic. I was hoping the plot would take a twist or something to find purpose in this story, but it never happened. I guess if you are into romance novels, maybe this is for you. But, I think I will try one of Sandra Brown's thrillers next."
2,Typical Brown!,"A claustrophobic, virginal, dysfunctional, young (maybe 27)school teacher (Laney)meets a handsome, confident (at times arrogant), loving, older (42) New York attorney (Deke) meet during a brief black out in the Big Apple. They spend one magical night together (where she looses her virginity and he finds love), that will change both of their lives forever. Laney who had been told when she was young that she was barren, finds herself pregnant from a one night stand. The rest of the story resembles the typical Sandra Brown love story in that Deke tracks her down, showers her with love and attention, something she is starving for, and sets out to exercise the demons that her mother has instilled in her. Apparently Laney's mother ""resented her and couldn't love her"" because she blames Laney for her husband's departure. Deke's desire to be apart of Laney's life and his unborn child spins a cute story that is easy to read and not too heavy. I enjoyed it."
3,Sandra Brown in her previous life,"While I enjoy everything Sandra Brown writes...I now realize why she went to writing novels. This story was good, but very unbelievable. What's the chances a woman(virgin, no less) meets a man in an elevator, sleeps with him, leaves the city and ends up pregnant as the result. Not only does the man come looking for her, but ends up marrying her and ending up with twins. Ah, if only life went this smoothly!"
1,Eh....Started out good......but.........,"I like Sandra Brown. This book starts out with a great plot idea but for me fizzled out in the end. Deke was too silly to be believeable. Some may like this book. For me...Eh, I would not recommend it to my friends. There are too many other good Sandra Brown books out there to waste your time with this one. (in my humble opinion that is)"
1,"Don't bother, seriously","If you're taking time to read reviews, you obviously want the truth. Here it is; Don't waste your time with this book.The plot and the characters were completely underdeveloped and unrealistic. I didn't ""feel the love."" There weren't any romantic scenes, and the love scenes were few and far between.The only good thing about the book is that you can read it in one day. Most likely you'll skip ahead peeking to see if it gets better and it doesn't!"
1,hard to put on and did not control lateral ankle movement,"I could not get this brace adjusted properly to where it would minimize lateral ankle movement. I have bigger calves than the guy on the picture on the box. And I could not cinch it down tight enough to control the side to side movement in my ankle. Also when I had it on, the bottom of the brace where the stirrup joined the supports just felt flimsy like the brace was sliding around.I'm going back to the store and try to find a ""sock"" type brace that slides over my foot."
1,Major Disappointment,"When I saw a Terrence Hill western, I purchased it. I loved the comedy western of 30 years ago and was looking for a new title from them again. This was one of the worst westerns that I have ever seen. Script was poor, acting was worse. The only reason that I watched the entire movie is because I purchased it. Find the old Trinity movies and have fun."
2,Sequel to DOC WEST - A doctor wants to help town by building a hospital through poker winnings. Overall kinda lame...I say D+,"A drifter (Hill) comes back to the town of Holy Sand and wants to help the locals by building a hospital, but needs money. In the sequel to Doc West (not necessary but helpful to watch first), Doc West (Hill) is still in high demand as a doctor. After half the town gets hurt in a bar fight he realizes its time to open up a hospital. He turns to the only way he knows in order to make money, a poker tournament. When an evil Dutchman rides in to town, (to compete and stop West from getting the money he needs) West must decide what is more important, the money or love. If you liked the first one you will probebly like this one as well. For me, low budget TV movies with bad acting are not my thing. I give it a D+."
5,Perfect!,"These worked great on my 1993 Crown Victoria. Buy two and replace the tensioner and idler pully at the same time, they are both the same. The parts store wants $20 for aftermarket pullies, buy these."
5,Exciting Debut Novel,"""Jean Henry blends fact with fiction in this exciting debut novel of the end of the outlaw era, and the first stirrings of love."""
5,LOVE+HATE,"Love + Hate = YealousyLove Word Play & a good ass lyricist don't matter if he reps south, north, east or west all that counts is the fact that putos love to listen and hate at least he gets comments I dont see others artists gettin more hate than him.P.S. IF U AIN'T GETTIN' HATE U DOIN'SOMETHIN'WRONG HOMIE!!!"
3,Not that Good!!,"La mayoria de las canciones estan siedo repetidas, pero que puedo decir... la calidad ba decayendo..."
2,"Same, old, same old.","This book is definitely not a bad book. On the other hand, it is not a great book either. While this book is written well, there's just a few plot things that make you rather irritated. The book's a little predictable at times and really, just another, ""Oh, this again? Hm.. that's nice.""The characters also tend to border on a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. Some of them are just 'perfect' and never seem to have a bad moment come to them. Sure Jeran Odara has troubnle with his magic but in the end, it's the fact that all odds seem to fall in his favor.Maybe these are just really minor things that can be ironed out as Funk starts to gain experience, but for now, the flaws are still there.Overall, a worthwhile read. However, worth a rereading? Probably not..."
2,Looks great works poorly,I am sorely disappointed with this. I have owned several other cookie presses that cost about half and was much happier with them. I don't recommend this press.GOOD: The case is great and the variety of plates is great.BAD: This press seems to have trouble with stiff dough. The rear cap slips as pressure is applied to press the cookie out. This makes the cookies uneven.
4,Good Show,"From 1984, Randy Brecker trumpet, George Adams tenor saxophone and Roland Hannah leading the rhythm section. Tracks 1 and 6 are brief features for Hannah and Adams respectivly.George is under control here. Nothing like the MINGUS AT MONTRUEX DVD. He hints at Pharaoh Sanders like avantguard-isms but never really crosses the line. Randy Brecker is his usually brassy self.An all around good show."
2,AN OKAY PICTURE BOOK,"Not much to rave about regarding this book. It tackles a very narrow subcollecting area of homefront collecting and consequently there are not a lot of items to show. The good news is its inexpensive and does show some really uncommon if not rare pieces albeit mostly in B&W. The insert paper priceguide is a joke and I'd scrap that. The collectors who contributed the photos were asked to price their own items hence the prices are inaccurate secondary to bias. If youre gonna buy it, buy it for pics of some pretty hard to find items and a trip down memory lane. Not much else to say otherwise."
4,a great buy,"Rich colors, satiny and soft. Not too thick, not too thin. Not stiff at all. I love it! It's well made and looks wonderful and sexy. It has a coupla threads coming out where they patches are sewn together, but that may be from my cats. Nothing major."
5,Lives up to the title,"This book really lives up to its title. By using the techniques in this book, I became more successful in my WPPI competition entries.Worth five times the price!"
5,A Competition Handbook!,"An absolute requirement for anyone entering professional print competitions! Lots of real-life examples, diagrams, illustrations, and full-color photographs make this a spectaular tool for any pro."
5,The Competition Print Book!,"If you plan on entering print competition for one of the PPA Affiliate associations, this is a great book. There are numerous ideas to help identify an award winning print submission.The photos are really great. The section on the logistics of an actual judging were helpful to me and my color lab in understanding how the prints should be printed for competition.I also enjoyed the other photographers who contributed their thoughts about print competitions. It was nice to get different perspectives. I know this information will help my future print competition submissions."
5,"Enthusiastic Tracking, The Step-by-Step Training Manual","I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to track with any kind of dog. The method is designed for the dog to always have success, and it's fun for both owner & dog. I am fortunate to have this book in my library & also to have attended a seminar by the author & to have been given tracklaying pointers by him the first time I laid a track for a tracking test. I can attest that he is an excellent teacher!M.A."
5,Excellent Beginners Guide to Tracking,"Enthusiastic Tracking, The Step-by-Step Training ManualI bought this book on a whim, thinking I could teach my new dog to track. The step by step instructions made this a most enjoyable adventure. Within weeks, my dog and I were playing ""hide and seek.""Although I didn't get to far in the manual, my dog could, and did, track me through a group of 600 people! She also used her new found game to find me when I left her home once to go to the hospital for surgery.For an inexperienced handler to be able to harness a dog's natural ability like this is amazing (although I'm happy someone saw her and brought her back home before she got to the hospital).What a great book!"
5,Get Your Copy Before they Disappear,"I just went looking for Bad Times Primer to buy a back-up copy. Surprised to see it is available only from a few used book dealers. Bad Times and Survival Guns by Mel Tappan have been on my bookshelf for years and I have worn out at least one copy of each. This is a great overview of the subject of preparing for an uncertain and possibly unpleasant future. No Rambo stuff here just good solid information, not out of date in any way.Remember the motto ""Those who prepare to survive deserve to survive..."""
2,"So, so","The dishes in this volume are a bit heavier and more Indian oriented. I prefer the less heavy southern Sri Lankan recipies. For those who prefer Indian food, the recipies are good and give an authentic taste."
1,not very good,"It's probably a good tip to never use a cookbook by someone who doesn't know that a potato is a vegetable......otherwise, not the best of food."
3,Nice ab work,"This is basically a DVD of breathing during Ab exercises. You start with some basic posture breathing exercises sitting in a chair. then it moves to the floor and the movements bcome increasingly difficult. You are to only take it to the level you are comfortable. This is not a ""work along DVD"" but an ""observe, then do"" style. It is helpful but I really expected more content for my money."
3,"Good concept, but short on content.","I agree on the fact that this video is short on content for the price tag. If you've been doing yoga for any length of time, much of this will be intuitive, and most likely you've been doing this stuff for quite some time.If you haven't done a lot of yoga, and you've spent a bunch of time torquing yourself through crunches, you will benefit from the perspective offered in this product, but again it's not my favorite of Scott's videos and seems to be a bit short on content."
4,One of Simak's better books,Our descendants from 500 years in the future have to leave their own time frame because earth has been invaded by creatures which are systematically wiping out the population. Gale the leader states that the whole population of 3 billion people will be travelling through timegates to temporarily settle in the present day. They then plan to build new timegates which will carry them back to the Miocene era so they will not upset the natural evolution of man. The rush is on to get everyone through as soon as possible because the threat of one of the aliens arriving through time would be catastrophic because of their fast breeding cycle. One creature gets through and the chase is on to destroy it before it breeds. Simak creates a believable situation in regard to how our politicians and religious leaders react to the invasion from the future. This was a thoroughly enjoyable book and if the subject of time travel is your genre then I suggest you check this book out
5,Come on help out Ol' Gil...,"Gil Gunderson usually referring to himself as ""Ol' Gil"", is a striving yet very unsuccessful businessman of Springfield. Althought he does not appear on the show too many times, he is very memorable as he has had a lot of failures in his life!This Collectable Item is a MUST HAVE for any Simpsons Collector!"
2,Good mystery with tragic writing,"A mystery story with the misfortune of having been written by an author too wrapped up in displaying his command of the English language. I spent so much time re-reading the convoluted structure of his writing and slogging through the liberal dosing of arcane vocabulary that there was absolutely no flow to the reading process. Despite a good plot with sound characters, readers shouldn't bother trying to pull the clues together to figure out where it all ends. The narration rambles and includes distracting information that neither furthers the plot nor particularly adds to the overall ambience of the work."
4,Foner Reviewed,Foner dilligently attempts to describe post-slavery America and Carribean Islands. Bravo Eric!
3,A wonderful love story????????,"I was surprised to read all the good reviews for this book. I was not impressed though I read the entire book. From what I could gather, Hallie wasn't in town long enough to form any great relationships with anybody. It was a bit on the cheesy side. And everything worked out just a little too smoothly all the time. From the moment she walked into the cafe she had a job, a beautiful home to stay in, a decent vehicle to drive and money. Course, she had the perfect kids and everything went along perfectly and the neighbors were instantly all her friends. I didn't feel any real chemistry between the two main characters and I thought the plot had a lot of holes. The big climax with her ex-husband was boring and I thought it was ridiculous when she left. I am a Miller fan, but this just didn't do it for me."
5,Last Chance Cafe,"I read this book and really enjoyed it. I like how the everything fell into place the way it did. Not too fast and not too slow. It almost makes you feel like Hallie did go back in time, when really, she was just in another town. She is there and meets all the town people, who all seem like they are from another time. And Chance is described as a cowboy, kindof sexy. ;) Jessie is more apt to ride a horse than drive her car. It is a great book. Any one who is any one will absolutely love this book and the ending doesn't leave you hangin. Highly recommended."
4,Great Read!,"This book was a great read, I read it in one sitting and loved it. I think that any fan's of romance should read this book!"
4,The last Chance Cafe,Thought this book was good. It was nice story boy helps girl and they help each other out. Never thinking that Halley could fall in love because of the dangerous past might catch up with her. She falls Head over heels for Chance. Chance tries to make Halley and the twins feel secure. Still Halley holds back. Then Danger comes to town and Chance Saves the day. Is it to late for Chance and Halley or is it their last chance for love?
5,Great Product,I was very pleased with this product. The player is extremely easy to use. The screen has high resolution. This product is just small enough to not get accidentally washed with a pair of jeans.
2,"OK MP3 Playe, will not play any video at all","I bought this item thinking that it was easy to use. In terms of adding music, it is. However, the software has a major problem for video. Based on the specs, it needs MPEG4 but after contacting Samsung USA, they told me it needs MPEG2. Either way, the software did not work or after spending hours and trying other converters, I gave up and am returning it.Also, the sound quality is not too hot either. My daughter's SanDisk (256 MB) sounds much better.Battery life, as far as I could tell was good.Also, do not be fooled. Even though it is a Samsung, it is made in China.Also, do not be fooled. Eventhough it is a Samsung, it is made in China."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchase the Samsung due to the fact that it got very good reviews. Unfortunatley, when I installed the installation disk, it had a virus on it. Thankfully my security software caught it, but it reported it as a severe security risk (MaCSMgr.exe). The USB cable had a difficult time keeping the connection to charge and to transfer. I was extremely disappointed there was a virus in the software. Sorry Samsung, won't be buying anything else from you again."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I purchased this item for the bath/shower used by my kids (2 & 4). I wanted a ""hands free"" way to wash hair, and then stand them up and rinse them off after a bath. The height of the existing shower head was just too high. This product was easy to install, and the lowest height position is just right for a standing 2 or 4 year old. The shower head has a spray setting which slows/reduces the water flow, also great for the kids. As they get older and grow they can simply adjust the height of the shower head upward however they like."
5,5/5,"i don't even speak spanish and this is my favorite cd...i think that's really all i need ta say...5/5 (an i luv every one a them beats)...so even if you don't speak spanish, juss by tha cd anyway..."
5,CHINGON,This is a very good cd man. Dyablo reallyknows how to rap.I think is cool that he raps a lot in spanish.Other chicano rappers just say a few words inspanish and dats it. The sound is also really cool.If you're looking for a good rap cd and know spanishthis one's for you.
1,I did not know it will be small and bad,"I was looking for another fast way of eating Jalapeno. When I got it, I was first surprised by the size of the container.When I tried it, I just threw it in the garbage. It is a very bad product. It is sweet and expensive. Do not waste your money on it.Best,"
1,Not At All Like The Picture!!,"If you look at the picture, like I did you see 6 compartments, 3 with lens 1 with the camera 2 with battery charger and I don't no what the 6th thing is!! The truth of the matter is, 1 Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi with lens will NOT FIT IN THIS BAG!!! THERE IS NOT 6 COMPARTMENTS IN IT!! IT'S TO SMALL FOR ANYTHING BUT A SMALL FLAT DIGITAL CAMER... My gals hand bag is bigger then this junk, it looks nothing like the picturesss... I am returning this junk as I speak....Rev. Tim Olivera"
3,"Great quality, small size","It is a very high quality bag with tons of pouches to store stuff, but the size 14 model is pretty small. It can't hold an slr camera with the lens attached, either just the body or maybe two lenses. I'll keep it to carry extra lenses along with other odds and ends, but I wish I had thought to look at the measurements more carefully. Look into getting a larger size bag if you plan to carry anything larger than a point and shoot camera or some lenses."
2,Not worth the price,"The lobster was rubbery, the crust had little flavor. The sauce was not very thick.It did bake well - no burning if the directions are followed."
2,"Cute, but not exquisite","Living in the desert, one does not have the opportunity to eat good seafood very often. I have a theory: lobsters cannot fly. And so, even live ones don't taste like 'lobster' out here. I spotted these pot pies at Costco, for about $35 for a box of four cute pot pies with puff pastry lobster outlines on top. I figured, these lobsters did not have to fly before they were 'prepared', and maybe they would be good. No luck. I am not saying they are bad, but certainly not worth around $9 per 5.2 ounce serving. Much of it was claw meat, while preferred by some, it did not have the right flavor for me. There were a few bits of non-claw meat that came close... but still no cigar. Overall a nice try... the presentation and puffed pastry was good. However these will barely if not at all satify your craving for that sweet and special flavor of lobster. Save your money for the next time you can go to a real fresh seafood restaurant where the lobsters have no frequent flyer miles."
4,Moms Mabley,"Comedy aint pretty, but it sure is funny when it's spit by Moms Mabley. Raunchy for her time and very funny."
1,Goofus?? - You'd Better Know What it is!,"If you don't know what a ""goofus"" is, then don't buy this album until you know how it sounds. I bought this album because Adrian Rollini was playing bass sax on it. Unfortunately I wasn't prepared for the irritating and ""out of place sound"" of the goofus in these arrangements. Buyer Beware!"
3,Cosby Showesque,"This is a pretty good book. The foreword and afterword are both pretty dull, but Bill still has some funny moments. More than anything else, this is a collection of funny bits about being a parent that you have probably heard before. While reading it, I couldn't help but think of The Cosby Show. It has that feel."
5,A Humorous Look Into the New Dads,"This is an older book by Bill Cosby. The book takes a humorous look at the nature of fatherhood in this world. A lot has changed for dads over the last few decades. At one time, a father had little interactions with his kids, but today a father is expected to be a ""good dad."" Cosby highlights this difficult journey. The sections in this book are wonderful. They are funny and true to life. One of the best aspects of this work are the illustrations that you will gain. You will have a ton of material for some sermons on parenting and fatherhood. He throws in a lot of Biblical references which makes the material even better. For a light read, and for some inspiration, and maybe a little understanding, this is a great book. Cosby is a genius, and his mark is throughout these pages."
4,Enjoyable,I really liked that book.It was hilarious and very fun to readits a book you shouldnt miss if you are a father or a kid ...
4,A book almost any father would enjoy,"A book almost any father would enjoy. It is very funny book, with lots of common sense hidden in the humor."
4,Endearing tales,"Bill Cosby's warm and gentle humor is a pleasure to read, and his observations on the travails of parenting will ring true to almost any parent. He highlights kids who don't listen, kids who don't study, kids who won't move out -- and he admits to having a soft heart for all of them. While there are few hard laughs in this book, there are many chuckles and knowing smiles.By contrast, the introduction and afterword by Alvin F. Poussaint are overlong, stuffy and completely unnecessary. Skip them."
4,Funny book with good advices for Dads new and old,"This is a classic book I've always wanted to read. Its funny and entertaining, but also has some good advice. Good book for Dads new and old. Get the paperback, its a bargain."
5,Good book,This book is a funny quick read classic for any parent not just fathers. It is of course very funny and provides a few things to think about concerning how you parent. Overall great book.
5,simplicity is the key,"I am reviewing the Wolverine and the cradle.a remarkable product that is so easy to use, you could train my cats to use it!The cradle allows you with great ease and simplicity to record directly from your tv, dvd etc.. by just pressing record.I am using the product as a storage device for my digital camera while I am on vacation and as an entertainment unit for my 3 year old who needs to stay in his seat on flight.The only small bad point is, that the speaker is static sometimes, especially when you have the volume on full blast. But, that is only important to me because I can't convince my toddler to put the headphones on.Otherwise, the Wolverine and its cradle are the gem of multi-media devices. Do not waste your money on anything else."
4,ok,i like it so far. the battery life isn't as long as they say. also when i download from my photo card it doesnt give me the option of downloading into photo file. and i have to download everything and then go individually and delete the ones i dont want. also it doesnt read my movie files from my cell phone like my pc does. have not had it long enough to experiment with it so maybe it does more then i think..
3,Could have been a better listening experience,"This is, unfortunately, a kind of off-the-cuff recording, done in what sounds like a school gymnasium (the way it echoes!). The music was wonderful, don't get me wrong, but the recording quality was way off and didn't do Mr. Pepper any justice at all. And that's not Amazon's fault."
3,Art Pepper on the Comeback Trail,"The sound on this recording is awful, but Art's playing is excellent! In 1975, early in his addiction recovery mode, and before signing with Contemporary Records, Art took advantage of the opportunity to play in the Foothill College gym in Los Altos, CA, and was recorded informally. Proper mike placement was impossible, but most of Art's playing comes through. Notes are by Art's wife Laurie."
2,UNUSUAL RHYTHM SECTION,"THE PENGUIN GUIDE TO JAZZ RECORDINGS gives a rhythm section of Tommy Gumina on Polychord, Fred Atwood bass, and Jimmie Smith drums. They go on to complain not only of the polychord but of the overall sound quality as well, but compliment Art for blowing very hard throughout. Fan of the polychord or not, let me inform you that Stan Getz plays the heck out of I'll Remember April on THE STOCKHOLM CONCERT with a rhythm section led by Jim McNeely on piano."
4,Brimstone Howl:Guts of Steel,"This album is amazing from a couple of Nebraskan's. They put on a great live show, the drummer who lived down the hall when I was in the dorms at UNL usually stands on the bass drum, while the guitarist gets on the lead singers shoulders. Their live shows will not disappoint. Enjoy this Alive! records release.Guts of Steel"
3,Rawlings workhorse batting gloves,"Gloves are nice and tacky when new but doesn't last very long. They also stretch after wearing, sweating in them a few times."
1,DETAILS MISSING FOR ORDERING,"Could not specify size when ordering. Tried to call manufacturer/distributor, could not get anyone on phone, on hold for 1/2 hr. Returned product, replacement sent (correct size). Still waiting to get credit for returned product. Rec'd e-mail 7/24 stating credit would be issued in 5-7 business days. Sent e-mail 8/8, could not reach by phone again!! Still no response or credit. Would not order their product again. Sorry about not focusing on product. Comment about service needs to be made."
5,Best batting gloves,second pair my son has owned. they hold up 2x as long as other brands. Plays high school as well as travel ball
2,did not work properly with battery !!,i have used it with battery video is clear but audio NOT CLEAR !! even 4 meters away !!
3,Not what I expected for homeschool,"If you are looking for a workbook with pages to do, this is not it. I guess this would be ""Fun with Grammer"" if you have more than one child. It's mainly games you can play to learn grammer, which takes more than one child to play. Classrooms and larger groups could benefit greatly with this book."
3,Repetition of activities,"Overall there were some good ideas in this book, but many of the activities are repeated - just modified to suit the topic such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Acrostic poems, Don't Say It and one where you read out a story and the students put their hands up when they hear for example a prepositional phrase."
5,Grammar Lessons,Great addition to the classroom. Adds some fun and creativity to teaching grammar in the elementary classroom. Easy to prepare for activities.
1,Large print edition may be missing a few chapters,The large print edition I had of this book was missing chapters 16-18. Very disappointing. This information was not listed on the cover.
5,Sierra Triumph paperback book,I purchased this to complete this series by Dana Fuller Ross. It came quickly and in great condition. I am very pleased with my purchase.
5,Excellent for teaching writing,"Lola Schaefer is an excellent writer and a master teacher, with many years experience. Her book is what every teacher needs to get their kids writing, examining their writing, and improving their writing.This book is excellent for both teachers that are writers and teachers who feel uncomfortable teaching writing. It smooths the process and makes it one of enjoyable discovery with your class."
4,Better than expected,"Bought this as a gift for my mom in-law...it's very well made & fashionable. The only draw back in my opinion is that there's not a lot of cushioning around the slot where you put the camera, so if you have other items in the section, you can probably scratch the camera (good thing there's another section for your stuff). Overall I like it."
5,Love the old Dick and Jane readers,I am in my 60's and am collecting all the old school books I read way back when. Not getting the new printed editions these were printed back in the 40's and love this book. Brings lots of memories of when I started to school.
1,disappointed,"I trusted GE when I bought this brand of bulb two months ago. I was disappointed to find this morning that two out of four simply don't work -- I've tried them in two different lamps to make sure the problem was with the bulb and not with my lamp.I'm getting ready to move and haven't time to try the remaining two bulbs, but wanted to warn others who have ordered these to try them and make sure they work. I'll update this review after I've tried the other two bulbs in the pack."
2,My husband ordered these,Got these and they really didn't work to well. Nothing like we thought. Hell stupid of us not to go to the Wal Mart and get them
2,ENFLOURESSENT DESIGN,"This design, must I start, is ineffiencet. I KNOW THIS, as my daughter's and my cats have trouble seeing now. We can no longer make Macoroooni art!! Needs more TESLA, and coils, which are a must. Henry Fords screwed this must do thing up with the coils, as such like as, insopartway---NEEDS insulation manuel and scematics. THIS IS NOT FARI! >:(( Took over two hours to install and put in the socket which. Also, box does not fit old lightbulb? Does not store probably like the commercial and ball, which bounces."
4,A good coffee table book.,"If you are a fan of the Hudson River school, you will not be disappointed with this book. The illustrations are large and clear, and the overview is precise. However, as noted by a previous reviewer, this is not a very detailed book. It is only a coffee table book after all."
3,Foam Lined Case Not That Great,"The picture of the item shows everything lined up nicely. The reality is the foam inside the plastic case is not fitted. The degree wheel is placed on top of everything and used as a ""locking mechanism"" of sorts to hold everything in place. In time the rubbing of the degree wheel against the plastic case can cause the numbers to rub off. A slightly larger case and fitted foam is needed."
5,Just Right,"This case was perfect fit for my new classical guitar, and allows for good protection and humidity control --- I live in the high desert --- when it's not being used."
1,this is too big for a Classical Guitar,"I don't know if they sent me a wrong one, but the label does say it is a classical model.but the case is way too big for my classical guitar! it fits my acoustic dreadnought body perfectly.I'm sending mine back for a refund"
3,De riguer reading for the PMI certification,"I'm glad to be able to purchase an ANSI spec from Amazon. It is an ANSI spec, but I give it about a 65, as it has an average beat and it isn't to difficult to dance to."
1,Where is my book?,"I cannot write anything about this book. I have ordered it at February 21, 2003 and still waiting for delivery (April 9, 2003)."
4,Excellent PMP Prep Book,"If you're taking the PMP exam anytime soon, you need to memorize every word in this book because this is what the questions are based on. It's also a great reference document for PM terms and definitions. But does it include lots of PRACTICAL information you can actually use on the job? The writing is too general to do that, but it almost has to be. I read this cover to cover several times and passed the PMP exam. Unless you're reading this for that reason, then you're better off visiting the Project Professor."
4,Great Content but Poor Organization,"This book is a good resource to use when planning a project kick-off meeting or writing project scope documents and business requirements for non-project oriented team members.The way in which the authors organize the chapters/topics do not seem chronological to me, based on my experience in running multiple large-scale projects.""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge : 2000 Edition"" is not a book that one can easily reference when trying to find a specific sub-topic or definition. A better reference book for project management is ""The Ama Handbook of Project Management."""
5,Best book of them all so far.,"This is the food I enjoyed in Mexico in the 70s. Not TexMex or tourist food. It has all you need to know. Peppers and the proper use ect. I used the tamale recipe in here and BINGO, perfect on my first try.( I will say that what ever you pay for fresh tamales is well worth it, since they are very labor intensive to prepare.)I have purchased several copies of the book for relatives. I consider this a must have cookbook. There are seasonings and the proper use of them in the book that I never really had down right before. When you taste the dish it is like ""Yeah, thats it!"". Bear in mind Mexico is very diverse and different regions cook differntly. Just like America. The author tells you that and offers where the recipe is from and such. If you want real authentic tasting food and not ""Tex Mex"", this is it. She tells you the technique for preparing the dish step by step."
2,Is it really heat resistant?,"The product information claimed that it was heat-resistant. I've had this mitt for awhile and haven't found it to be resistant at all....I mean, I can hold things for about 30 seconds before I start to feel the heat come through and have to quickly put the hot dish down.I do like the oven mitt, and use it all the time since it's the only oven mitt we have, but just wish things wouldn't burn my fingers while holding something."
5,Worth the $$ Have & Will Buy Again,"I bought 2 of these gloves, 1 short, 1 long, on a whim while on EUR Holiday in 2006. They seemed a little pricey but I needed a quick gift for my personal chef, driver, husband @ the airport. Mr.T loves them and swears that the rubber protects his hands from the heat better AND the wide hand box makes it easier to quickly get your hand in or out. Additionally, the rubber inside provents accidential slipage..',~O Go Figure....It's been 4 years & I just ordered him a second set."
5,"Yes, underrated.","This cd gets 5 stars because it contains 5 versions of songs that are the original European mix. When the album was first released only the import was available and it was so much more raw and genuine. You could actually feel that album. Then the U.S. release came out and took it down a notch. Whoever decided the songs could stand improvement, including replacing Gary Barden on ""Still Love That Little Devil"" with Derek St. Holmes on the U.S. version, was wrong. Please release the original album and discard the American mix."
4,UnderRated,"This album rocks. One of my favorite songs is ""Time Waits"" . It is truly a hidden classic. Systems Failing and I'm Gonna Make You Mine bring out the strengths of this fine axeman. I bought the original and that is what I base my review on. It kicks and I still rock to it 20 years later. I had the LP and now the CD. I also recommend ""Michael Schenker Group Live - Unforgiven World Tour"" . That has MSG, UFO, and Scorpions music all over it. Of course, the common denominator is Michael Schenker in all of those bands."
4,Complete and Easy to Use,"This guide was what I was looking for -- a complete, easy to use (and easy to carry) book on the math and best methods of casino gambling plus information about casino operations and management (I would like to have had more in this area, but what is there is good). I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks the title fits what they're looking for..."
5,I like them.,I see all of these bad reviews but I actually liked these gates. I have two of these gates and used them both for about 6 years. I never had a problem and prefer them over others.
1,Any Gate But this One,"I am a mom of 2, and purchased this gate after moving into a home with stairs. Needless to say I am back online shopping for a new one. This gate is worthless, and my 13 month old pulls it down with ease. My 2 year old daughter also cut her finger on it, and it ruined the paint on my wall. I trip trying to get over it everytime. I would suggest any gate but this one, don't waste your money."
3,Good for the price,"The Good:1. If you have small dogs that can't jump real high or do not jump over things these are good.2. They are cheep, you get two for the price of one compared to the others.3. If you are pregnant they are easy to step over without tripping.The Bad1. They are hard to adjust to fit in door frames2. They are not high3. They are cheep and this time I am not referring to price."
2,For my dog,"I have the same gate but mine has the square's and not diamonds.This gate is constantly falling apart. It doesn't matter if my children are openning it or my husband and I, it just unlatches from the metal about three times a day. It has also come loose from the wood and has splintered. And as others have said it is very high! I am only 5' 4"" and I have to really stretch my legs to get over it.I only have it to keep my puppy from going to the rest of the house and for that it does a wonderful job. My only complaint is that it keeps falling apart. If I still had little ones running around I would suggest buying a different gate. This one is just not secure or made well."
3,Not as bad as all stated,It is very basic. You pull and lift very easy. Our's is 4 1/2 years old over time they can push it over (older children) but I used it all the time. Other ones I spent much more money on broke. But I would never use for a stair way. And the dog can jump it. Mine is far from breaking. Many people I now us this style. And when you have a baby and a preschooler it is very easy to step over verse using your hand. Good for the money
2,Save your money!,"This gate is just plain bad. It is semi-high so unless you have really long legs, it's a pain in the butt to step over. Plus, when you DO step over, the metal clip is right there and it ""bites"" your skin. I am 5'6"" so not on the short side... and I still had problems.It took me numerous tries to get it to lock to the wall correctly. It was either too loose and fell over or too tight. It really is made very poorly. Ours has since been returned..."
4,great gate,I have one and it works great for my 1 year old daughter.. I am even purchasing another one.. It is not for the top or bottom of stairs. I have no complaints about it...
3,"Not The Best, But Works Fine","You get what you pay for. This is an inexpensive gate and it works fine for our very active, crawling 7-month-old. It is sharp (as stated in one of the other reviews) but we just hang a throw blanket over it. It is very sturdy, I wouldn't be able to pull or push it out. Soon our baby will be too big for this gate, but he will probably be to big for any gate, so this is cheap and works well for a while. We are completely satisfied and looking to buy another."
1,Never drink cheap wine!,"I had bought and returned this. I wanted to keep my 8 mo old out of the kitchen which has a pretty standard size doorway, and not 5 minutes after I put it up it fell on him. I agree with another saying that they don't make this like they use to. I was also trying to save a few $$ and like I said ""never drink cheap wine"" (you get what you pay for)."
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought these gates despite having read the negative reviews. I figured they were cheap and we were placing them in doorways that we wouldn't need to remove them that often. My inner voice was telling me not to, but they were the only gates we could find that were pressure mounted, at the time. We rent and can't drill holes in the walls. Unfortunately, we couldn't get the gates to stay up. Our house is a little older, so our doors may not be perfectly straight. I also found that the little notches were either two close or far apart to make the gate fit. We will be returning them as soon as we can."
1,Do you want to protect those little fingers? Not with this.,"At first thought you automatically think it's great, keep the little ones safe, confined to a safe space. But not with this gate. The plactic which is used to make the diamond shaped mesh holes is so sharp that it can cut your little ones fingers as they pull themselves up using it and/or grab onto it as they fall, ouch."
4,Good product at a good price,"I usually don't write reviews for products, but we have been using this one with our 16 month old boy for months and are very happy with it. Sure, it does have a metal part or two, and if your baby gets fixated on those...well, what are you going to do? And as for instructions...gee, I don't know what to say about that...they couldn't be any easier to set up (with no instruction). BTW, our home is from the 1920s, with nary a straight line in it, but it works well most anywhere. We actually have 3 of them and use them to open and close different areas of the house, giving our toddler lots of different rooms to play in...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,A Middle-of-the-Road Gate,"I have used these gates for the past 5 years and they have been very sturdy. What I don't like is that no matter what I do, the rubber ends always end up leaving marks on the paint on both sides of the doorway. Also, my daughter was able to figure out how to use the adjustable measuring bar as a step to push herself up and over the gate! But then again she was well over 24 months by then anyway. I like the sturdiness of this gate but the marks left on the paint by the rubber stoppers has been bothersome."
1,NOT EVEN WORTHY OF 1 STAR!,"TRYING TO BE COST RESPECTFUL TO THOSE WHO WHERE BUYING FROM MY REGISTRY I CHOSE THESE GATES. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THESE. I FIND THEM UNSECURE, UNSTABLE, UNABLE TO STAY UP! THESE GATES STAY SECURE THREW A NOTCHED SYSTEM. SO I FOUND MYSELF EITHER JUST TOO SHORT W/THE GATE BEING TOO LOOSE OR TOO TIGHT, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIT THE GATE INTO THE DOORWAY AT ALL! ON THE OTHER HAND I HAVE HAD GREAT LUCK WITH THE SECURE SOLUTIONS SWING GATE BY EVENFLO, AND HAVE HEARD WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THE SIMPLE & SECURE GATE BY THE FIRST YEARS. I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU!"
2,Should have known better,"We were so excited when we found these gates because they were so inexpensive compared to other ones, but I guess we should have known better. We've learned that you get what you pay for.These gates are very short so it's only a matter of time before our daughter can climb over them. However, since they don't fit very snugly, she can just push them over for now. One of the adjuster bars cracked the first time we used it.It is nice to be able to just grab it and move it around to which ever room we are going to be in. But, we've decided to get gates that mount to the walls because they are much safer."
1,Safety Hazzard,My 8 month old tried to climb up this gate. The whole thing fell down on him and his foot got stuck between the wires. It was hard to let his foot go while he cried and tried to squirm away from it. He almost sprain his ankle.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this 2 pack of gates prior to the birth of my son. They are HORRIBLE. They are extremely difficult to use, and they just don't seem safe enough. It seems like my son can pull them down because they aren't very sturdy and they come off track constantly when I take them down and try to put them back up. My advise is to invest in the $50 hands free gates, even if it's not a high traffic area. I just don't see how these gates are safe."
2,only for low traffic,"I bought this, and it only stayed up for 10 minuets. It is a very sturdy and stable gate, but I do not recomend it for high traffic areas, because you have to undo and reposition it any time you want to go through (I am not gracful enough to climb over it with a laundry basket or baby on my hip)."
4,Position and Lock Gate,"This is an inexpensive gate that basically does its job. We use it to block the entrance to our living room, since its our designated child-proofed room of the house. It does no damage to the walls, expands reasonably far, and is easy enough to install. You just need to memorize or mark the notch or setting that fits your door width best. The only drawback is that it can be dangerous when not in use. We've had our baby pull the gate down when it was leaning against a wall. Luckily, the soft part of the gate was the part that landed on her, so there weren't too many tears!"
1,Awful Product,"This gate is terrible - it seems so simple, but it doesn't install properly and is dangerous. We tried for a few hours to get it properly installed in our standard doorframe and it was flimsy enough for our 8-month old to easily pull down.I'd give it 0 stars if possible."
1,Unsafe & cheaply made,"We baught this gate a few months ago to keep my dog from going on the new carpet down the hallway. When the dog was outside we would take the gate down so we did not have to continue stepping over it. Well, this continued putting up and taking down has bent the bar that holds the pressure to the walls. No my 4 year old can touch it and it will just fall over. Do not buy this gate if you will be taking it up and down often. Also it is not very sturdy and will not support a child weight from pulling on it. We are expecting another baby in August and I will be getting a different gate."
1,TERRIBLE!!! DOES NOT WORK!!,"After driving all over town trying to find a wall secured gate over 42"", I bought this one. WELL, IT STINKS!!!!!!!It does not work and will NOT SECURE to our wall. I'm soooo mad for wasting my time and money and the fact I have to drive 30 miles round trip to return it. SHAME ON YOU Babies R' Us for not testing the products you sell!! Now how am I going to keep my visiting baby niece and big dogs separated???????"
5,Good fit,"It was easy and quick to install, fits like a glove. Would recommend this one. Thanks to Dale for the info."
1,Sent it Back,"Definitely not up to the Kylloe standard. Many photos of structures were snow covered making it impossible to actually see the building. Many photos so small it was impossible to see what was there. Many photos so dark and shadowy it was impossible to see what was there. Even though this is a paperback in a smaller format,it is still a Kylloe book and should be the same quality as his other books, but it isn't--not by a long shot. Actually, it seems it might be a way to use rejected photographs from other projects to make money."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I just bought this item. The product itself is a piece of junk.The Rec and Play buttons won't stay down to do their job. Or, they stay down for 5 seconds then pop back up so it is completely unusable. I plugged it into a phone jack and now because it didn't work right, I have to call the phone company and get them to check my line for new line noise that really disturbs conversations. I'm going to just throw it in the trash and NEVER buy this manufacturer's products again. The vendor did their job very well but the product itself not only can't be used but disturbs your phone line and also I had to replace an electrical outlet. Do Not Waste your Money and do not even get this if it was free; it is not worth damaging your phone and electric circuit. Sorry I had to give it one star..would have preferred to give it a zero."
5,"from ""The Word Among Us"" Press","Love: A Guide for Prayer, the first in the Take and Receive Series, offers six weeks of prayer that will lead Christians to more deeply experience God's love, to recognize their total dependence on him, and to respond in freedom to praise and serve him. The meditations are based on the model of conversion found in the Principle and Foundation section of the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius.Love: A Guide for Prayer will meet readers wherever they are in their spiritual journey and lead them to the fountain of love and mercy which is Christ.These revised and updated editions offer 36 structured meditations, providing a relevant Scripture passage, an incisive commentary, and a suggested approach to prayer for that day.Designed as a support for private prayer, these exercises can also be used in prayer groups, faith-sharing communities, and Bible studies. Spiritual directors and retreat leaders will find the series to be invaluable in bringing others to Christ."
2,"""updated version""","This appears to be an updated version of the original ... as I love the indepth devotion the orginal one provided, I'm not a fan of this version."
5,Recommended Book for your prayer time with the Lord,Heard about this book from a friend. It is a good book for support and direction for solitary prayer but could be used in a group setting too. It helps me focus on knowing and receiving God's love and is based on St. Ignatius of Loyola's spiritual direction exercises.
1,Clean something else with it,"This might clean your lug nuts if you have a 3"" bore where your lug nuts go :). Other then that forget it."
2,Not so good,"Agree with other review, this thing will only work if your lugs are perfectly sized for this item. Does not work on my 68 Camaro or 03 Boxster."
2,Tight fit,Brush does an ok job. The wires that hold the bristles are a little flimsy. Brush does not get into all types of lugs.
2,Crappy,"Acquired that to be part of a Sparrow's costume. The outside view of the box is nice...but once i've opened it..I face a plastic bag with some lego-alike thingies and a ..STICKER on the bottom of the inside's box, imitating a compass.Typical china-made product."
3,A fantastic message that appears too late into the book,"This book carries with it a great message to the whole of the world and its importance cannot be challenged.However the style of writing took a great deal for me to plow through and unfortunately the amazing message of the Hopi people gets lost in a jungle of other information.It is a shame that this is the case as the message is important but the book is very long,having said that i would still tell people to read it as the Hopi content of the book should be read by as many people as possible"
3,Huh?,"Interesting, but weird. Have an open mind, or don't bother. The politics of the book got me fired up. Some of the mystical content left my jaw hanging open."
1,"Very weak, to say the least.","Thomas Mails is one of the best authors about Native Americans ever. His Mystic Warriors of The Plains, Dancing in The Paths of The Ancestors and both Fools Crow books were all masterful. But this book is by far his worst. I really had to force myself to read this book to the end. If I had to use one word to describe it: vague. All information about the Hopi and their prophecy's take up the space of about 30 pages. The remaining space is filled with the author's vague ramblings.I was amazed that a man of Mails' intelligence could believe that the end of times is near and that only the Hopi and like-minded individuals will ""board the ark"". A good book about the Hopi and their prophecies would be more than welcome, but instead of treating the subject critically he lets the Hopi prophecies cloud his common sense. This book is a waste of time and money."
2,Needs an Editor,"While I give five stars to Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power by Mails because of its moving and enjoyable content and very readable style, The Hopi Survival Kit is hard to survive and might dissuade readers from getting to know Fools Crow through Mails's two books on the great man. One can browse through the Kit and pick up the esssential message, or one can look up brief and readable accounts of Hopi prophecy by Thomas Benyacya and Dan Katchongva."
1,The Hopi Survival Kit,"This is one of the most disappointing books I have ever tried to read. It some ways, it reminds me of the anticipatory tension device used in the TV series 'Lost'- a constant tease pregnant with possibilities followed by another tease with no resolution in sight. In the end, anything resembling a result turns out to be mediocre, at best. The Author too often inserts his Christian bias as well as deducing clearly unsubstantiated information as possible fact. I can empathize with the Author's respect for the Hopi people and their mistreatment by the US Gov and assorted greed-focused corporations; however, this book does this honorable people more harm than good.I hoped for so much more when I read the title.Read 'Neither Wolf Nor Dog' by Kent Nerburn for real insight into Native Americans written by a white man from direct experience."
5,Money saver!,"This book has many recipes designed to save money, and most of these are sold for very high prices in the specialty health food stores. Soups, breads, even tofu and other soy products; make them to your taste for much cheaper!"
5,A book to keep and reference regularly,I have had this book in my kitchen for about 20 years! It is a good reference for the health and nutrition it references.
3,pretty good,"it's not a very big book, but it does contain some interesting recipes, I would say overall that it's not a great book, but it does contain some useful idea's for some healthy meals and snacks, so that in itself makes it useful."
3,New Exotica!,"At last, some new Exotica, albeit by a veteran performer. Not a bad offering considering Drasnin is now in his 80s. I enjoyed this album but unfortunately it's a little too much easy listening for me. I don't really feel this album, although a nice listen, is really a fitting sequel to Robert Drasnin's [[ASIN:B0000059YI Voodoo], which is brilliant and a great ambassador for this genre.If you want to check out Exotica Lounge then I suggest try Drasnin's original[[ASIN:B0000059YI Voodoo]], and of course any anthology of Martin Denny is essiential, such asThe Best of Martin Denny's ExoticaorThe Exotic Sounds of Martin Denny, followed by Les Baxter and Arthur Lyman.However saying that I'm sure these Dresnin pieces would be lovely played live in the right setting, and it does a good job relaxing you, much more than many of the Chill artists can do today with their repitious beats.Let's hope Dresnin is just warming up for Voodoo 3!"
5,bluebeams & moon flames,"The long awaited follow up to 'Voodoo' sounds as if it could of been recorded at the height of the Exotica movement, which is a compliment to the skill of the composer & producer, as the atmosphere of the genre is something Exoticalites, like myself enjoy alongside the music itself, (some fascination with time travel I believe we share).So a rare treat for fans of highest quality Exotica, awaits those adventurous enough to explore these hidden shores.Please can we have a No.3.!!!"
2,"Very dreary- this ""Voodoo"" is ""DooDoo""...no mojo!","Just received this CD to add to my ""Tiki"" lounge library.Bad choice. Really mellow....as in snore. Nothing ""Tiki""about this future frisbee. Lesson learned here:Just buy Martin Denny- the undisputed KING of Tiki~!"
4,The BIology Problem Solver,"A well organized review material for undergrad levelled general biology. Different from heavy volumed, too broadly covered other biology textbooks, this book focuses on important topics and guides from easy questions to challenged ones. Especially, for the biological functional aspects, this book allows lot of portion and makes it more efficient to get high scores in exams. I studied this book with Campbell's Biology (4th ed.) to prepare GRE Subject test and got over 95% score two years ago.Highly recommendable biology book to summarize overall course works and prepare for any undergrad level-biology exams. The only drawback of this book is the relatively weak coverage of modern molecular biology section."
4,Useful for the DAT,Bought this for DAT preparation. Found it to be very useful since that Bio on the DAT is becoming progressively more difficult. Ended up doing very well in Bio on the DAT (not just due to this book but this book did help a lot).
2,Tabu by Dana Bar Soap,The bars of soap I ordered and recieved were not as pictured. They were a grey color not brownish.
5,A true and accurate account,"One of the heroes in this book, Gene Meese, is a friend of mine. He no longer talks much about his war experiences but he does say that Ned Handy tells the story with great accuracy. Oh, sure, much was omitted -- some of it quite bad -- but the core and substance is there and treated well.Knowing Gene and reading the book deepened my appreciation for all the terror our troops, past and present, have endured for our country."
5,My Favorite Anime Series,"I completely love this series, and it gets better with each DVD collection. It is perhaps the most visually beautiful anime series I have seen, with an appealing main character, a zen-like atmosphere and an overall quality of peace which pervades the series, regardless of anything that happens during any individual adventure. The art is stunning, the music is lovely, it is something I share with friends. The stories are generally serious, but not violent, and are always fascinating. I enjoy watching this series so much that I even watch the special features and enjoy them (I don't, generally)."
1,stem cell now,"This was more an advertisement for a product sold by the writer than an education piece. Not worth the money or time. The product is made from blue green algae which according to the writer stimulates the number of circulating stem cells. Interesting that the writer has in interest in the the company that makes this product. Very skimpy on explaining what stems cells are but if you need some very basic information and can keep from being sold a bill of goods, this can be helpful."
3,Not the WiteWater kayaking!,Just let WiteWater kayaking funs know that you will see only 6 min. from 46min about WiteWater kayaking on Africa's Zambezi River (exiting!). The other episodes are about something interesting connected with water adventure but not about WiteWater kayaking.
2,Really thin and rough,I just received it today and it's super thin and rough compared to other towels. I'll see how it feels after washing it but seems like it's pretty cheap material.
5,"Kendra Lee, I bow and kiss your feet!","Are you tired of the same old diet of ""collaborative/discovery/listening/networking/commitment objective/lead generation/fulfillment"" sales books? Then wrap your brain around ""Selling Against the Goal"". Absolutely the best, single source, text I have read on how to understand your sales process and manage your sales territory! This book is 307 pages of the most effective content on things sales professionals need to do every day in order to succeed at selling. If I ever meet Kendra I will bow and kiss her feet."
3,Niche book on sales -- Sales Metrics Oriented,This is a niche book for your sales library. If possible I would give it 3.5 stars.If you are looking to establish sales metrics for yourself or a sales team this book is worth the money. Buy it if that is your motivation. You won't be disappointed.Outide of metrics I don't recommend this book.
4,Reed and Barton Flatware Chest,"I purchased this chest to hold family heirloom silverware given to me by my aunt. Her original chest was badly broken, so this seemed like a good replacement based on the description. Unfortunately, it is a tad to short for my silver. My silver has very ornate handles, which must be just a little thicker than Reed and Barton had in mind. Hence, the slots are filled to the top with 11 pieces, and the 12th has to be placed elsewhere. I'll go ahead and use it for a few years until it makes me too crazy and I replace the chest. However, if the slots had been even 1/8th inch taller, my set would have fit. I wish I had understood that beforehand. Other than that, it seems like a reasonable quality for the price."
3,"For illustration, I thought the cutlery was complete.","Eu sou brasileiro e meu Ingls no é muito bom. Minha irm mora na E.U.A. e eu precisava comprar um presente de casamento para ela. Eu escolhi Amazon para facilitar a entrega. Eu vi a ilustrao e , como tem talheres , eu pensei que era completo. Claro que eu achava que era muito barato, mas eu no sei o custo de uma cutelaria americana , assim que eu suspeito que esse preo era apenas a caixa . Qual foi minha surpresa quando minha irm disse que recebeu apenas o peito talheres ! Mesmo que ela amou a caixa, achei muito elegante e bem feita. Agora eu sei que no peito ""significa caixa , e que é bom usar uma ferramenta de traduo para melhor compreender as descries dos produtos ! Mas eu sugeriria que a Amazon usa a caixa vazia na ilustrao, sem talheres, como muitos estrangeiros compram através da Amazon e no entendo bem Ingls . Muito melhor que a imagem é fiel ao produto , demonstrando exatamente o que está sendo vendido."
5,Perfect Flatware Chest,"This is the most beautiful chest, the way it is put together is top of the line. Finding out Reed&Barton will engrave a plaque for the top was an extra bonus and a wonderful surprise. I am so glad I choose this one, the color of rhe wood was rich and warm. I love it !!!"
4,Just what I was looking for,I was looking for a flatware chest to protect the silverware my grandmother gave me. I had heard from my sister that the options at Bed Bath and Beyond did not have wide enough slots for my silver. My husband found this one on Amazon and I love it. The wood looks very nice and it even has a space for the serving utensils in the drawer. I would recommend this flatware chest.
5,Reed & Barton Bristol Flatware Chest,This flatware Chest was in excellent condition when it arrived. No scatches were found in the wood and the hardware was in good shape. An 80-piece flatware set fit in the chest without any problems. The drawer at the bottom of the chest had no problem with the height of the server set.
5,Beautiful!,This chest is beautiful and worth every penny. It came in one day with the added PRIME charge of 3.99. This is such a good deal considering it came UPS. It is a gift so I haven't seen silverware in it but I'm sure it will hold all needed. The finish is lovely and has the rich aroma of finely crafted wood furniture. The drawer works perfectly without sticking as one review stated. I compared pricing with Macy's and they had it on sale for twenty dollars more than Amazon! The bonus is that they give you a pre-paid envelope to mail in instructions of lettering choices for the brass plate on the lid. What a nice gift this is!
4,make real money from other people's trash,"This book is all about looking through others people's garbage cans, and finding something useful, valuable, or sellable. A LOT of good tips, especially the part about dealing with good-for-nothing rent a cops or other nosy jokers looking to make you feel guilty about being gainfully employed in salvage. Includes tips on how to minimize such confrontations and shakedowns.The author of this book emphasizes that most people, rather than finding a way to recycle, just put their burdens in the Garbage can; perfectly good and useable stuff: jewelry, watches, money, coin collections, antique toys, reloading supplies, firearms, even brand new goods still in the original box- UNOPENED!Carry some soap and water and clean up after a dumpster episode. not hard, maybe potentially lucrative to look.

2,Good Instruction Manual,"I enjoyed this book for a lot of the tips and descriptions Hoffman gave. It ceertainly gave me many ideas about where to go and what to do. Hoffman is a gifted writer and the cartoons are hilarious and pointed. If I could have given this book 2.5 stars I would have.Unfortunately in this book, Hoffman also advocates lying, cheating, and taking advantage of others. His statements on mental illness alone are enough for me to find him personally repulsive. I'm glad I read this book but I certainly won't be buying it."
2,"Cheap price, cheap quality","I was disappointed to find the ""heavy weight"" spoons are in fact very, very lightweight. The price should have been a big clue that I was not going to get much spoon for the money. Think ""greasy spoon"" quality cutlery. I wish I had upgraded to a known brand name like Mikasa. These would be great for those learning spoon-bending as a parlor trick."
3,Nice product but WRONG product,"Can't really rate the ice tea spoons, because although that's what I ordered, and that's what it said on the manifest on the outside of the box, that's not what I got. Instead of the long handled ice tea spoons I wanted, I got a dozen bouillon spoons (that's what it says on the small box that was packed inside the bigger one). They're actually very nice bouillon spoons so I'm keeping them and trying again - but it's ice tea spoons that I can't find at any local store and was looking forward to."
3,Get what you pay for,"These are inexpensive spoons that function adequately for every day use. If you're looking for something that has weight, has a highly polished surface, and smooth ergonomic edges this is not the product for you. These are lightweight spoons, and it does not take much leverage to bend them. They only had a moderately reflective surface when new, and after several months of use and washing are down to a dull finish (lots of tiny scratches). These appear to be stamped out of a mold and all of the edges are crisp, very crisp, some might even say sharp. The design is unremarkable, and it only provides a different character versus a smooth spoon."
2,"Poor Quality, Light-Weight, Easily Bent, Sharp Edges","When these spoons arrived, I realized why they were so inexpensive. They are:-- so lightweight that they can be easily bent, and-- so poorly finished that the metal edges of the handle are a little too sharp to the touch."
3,Not the best quality.,"I bought these a while back as replacements for the factory driving lights on my 2000 Cherokee. With the creation of a simple bracket they fit right in place and are the right size for the air dam holes. My complaints are: the wiring is too short to change the buld without disconnecting and/or cutting wires, the metal thing in front of the bulb came loose within two months (I took them out)and the refective coating is peeling. I realize these aren't high-quality expensive lights, but I think they could do a bit better."
1,unsatisfied customer,"We purchased a Hella Optilux H71010281 Model 1200 clear fog lamp kit on June 16th. One of the lamps has fog in the glass. The kit is advertised as having a 1 year warranty. We e-mailed Amazon and they that the manufacuter is responsible for the warranty. We e-mailed Hella, and they said that it is to be warrantied by the sellor, which is Amazon. I have a retail buisness and are responsible to my customers. I expect that Hella and Amazon should be responsible to me as well.Jon Bowers, President Northeastern Auto Supply Inc"
1,Dried Up,Rec'd Potty Putty and opened to find it completely dried up and crusty. The plastic toy was shrink wrapped so I don't know why it would have dried out except that it must have been on a shelf for a very LONG time..... not worth my time to return for $3.99.
4,Perfect fit!,"Perfect fit, but the blades are thinner than the original. Stainless is the only way to go. As a back up, or a temp prop, this is great. One scrape on the ramp though and your wobbling."
4,Worth the paper cuts,"This almost unknown book is a great mix of politics and the military where even techno-talk takes back stage. Truly close to the hard science level, with little to no explanations for the things you're to take for granted. I found it to be extremely hard to not finish this book soon after I began reading it. When one group of space inhabitance goes it alone and has to survive they find them selves on the edge of a blade with one hope to beat the clock. My true enjoyment is so closely related to the ending that I can really only say; The world they leave behind can never recover from what they get done."
3,Ok,The seams are easily unravel especially in the arms. The string in the right arm of mine is starting to come loose after only 4 washes. It's an ok shirt. Nothing special. Cheap.
4,Good polo,"I woudl have preferred the cotton to be a little thicker, but this was a high quality shirt. Cut a little smaller than I would have hoped, specifically shorter in teh body than I like."
1,No notification,"I ordered this condoms,but they shipped me something else without any notification. I checked and they said this was discontinued. I can still find it somewhere else. I'm still waiting for my refund."
4,High-energy disco funk,"Part of the August Darnell / Ze Records family. Very energetic, disco/funk that is not usually heard anymore. Well worth obtaining if you like dance music."
1,Don't waste your money until the kinks are worked out.,"I was initailly impressed with this device, but being an early adopter is risky and I ended up being disappointed in the end. Live video capture direct from my TV went well at first, then started to get fuzzy, flip and change color without explanation. Whenever I scheduled a 30, 60, or 90 minute record from the TV, it consistantly stopped recording at about 5-8 minutes. There was no conversion software in the box which enabled me to convert video formats to MPEG4, so I was forced to use freeware. After conversion, the device did not recognize the format. I bought this device to make long, tedious hours on the plane more enjoyable, but alas, if the MegaView can't accomplish recording tasks, it does me no good. Because this is a Japanese product, support is almost non-existent and even the website is sparse as well as difficult to navigate. This is a good idea that isn't quite done yet. Too bad. See ya in about a year."
3,Not A Comfort Fit,"I bought this ring as an upgrade to my basic Tungsten Carbide band. I wanted a dressier look since I no longer work in an environment that beats up softer metals.The ring is very nice looking and the size fits well. However I expected a ""Comfort Fit"" ring to have buffed out, smooth edges to the Florentine cuts and edges. I gave up wearing the ring after a week of daily wear when the inside of my middle and little fingers became so raw that wearing the ring became too painful to endure.I will keep the ring to pull out if I want a dress ring, but otherwise it will reside in my dresser drawer. I will wear my plain old ""Comfort Fit"" Tungsten Carbide band for daily wear."
2,"One Interesting Song, One Excellent Song , Fourteen Bad Songs","John Kander is a great composer. However, before he met up with the equally great lyricist, Fred Ebb, he composed this trite, forgettable score. It isn't entirely Mr. Kander's fault that the score is bad. No, his melodies are sometimes lovely, sometimes exiting and show promise. That doesn't mean their especially memorable though. However, the lyrics really are insipid and awkward in this show. William and James Goldman (the latter to write the book to Sondheim's brilliant Follies) are not great lyricists unfourtunately.However, there are two songs on this album that make it worth purchasing. The first is an odd little song called ""My Son the Lawyer"" which is quite inventive. However, the greatest song of the score is ""Harmony"", a very tuneful, musically inventive song. Even the lyrics aren't too bad here.So if you like buying albums for a few songs, go ahead. However, if you're looking for an overall excellent piece, this is not for you."
3,"Ferrari Dino 246, 308, 328..: Good, but not Great","The book was one of the first available on the Ferrari V8 family.It's a bit light on technical detail, and the B&W illustrations make it hard to pick out fine features the serious enthusiast/restorer is looking for. As expected of a British publication, it has lots of info on European model variants, but neglects the US varients. It's also a bit dated as to it's statistics, manufacturing run data, etc. Newer publications have more comprehensive data that just hadn't been released by the factory when this book was written.A much better book is: ""Original Ferrari V8"" by Keith Bluemel, et al: color illustrations, well researched.I recommend getting BOTH. This is a good 2nd source.It's still a good read & reference source. It has some 308 data that I haven't seen anywhere else."
4,Pureology Hydrate Shampoo,I've been using this product for about 8 months now. It is the best and I've tried some of the top selling brands. Makes hair manageable and does protect color somewhat.
5,great stuff and no harsh by products that leave your hair oily or waxy,Best stuff I have used! I have thick thick curly hair and I love this stuff.
5,pureology,The shampoo and conditioner arrived in good condition and in the time expected. The quality is great.
5,Wow,"This a great amplifier. Steal of a price. At first i didn't expect too much seeing how its only 300 watts, but wow. I have it hooked up to a pioneer tsw5102 with a peak of 6000 watts in a 2.75 cubic foot box and wow this thing can pound. Its not just noise either it actually sounds really good no distortion and quite crisp. Very pleased and would recommend to anyone looking for a well priced sub amp"
5,"Great amp, plenty of power","The amp works great. I installed it in an old JBL Sub135 subwoofer cabinet. Had to make a custom back to mount it because the holes were different sizes. Amp has way more power than the 200 watt rated jbl amp. I barely have it on, on a scale of 1-10 a it would be on 1. It would blow this sub out of the box."
4,Grandson Loves It - except...,"This was a gift for our grandson and he's totally fascinated by it. The only reservation I have is the strength of the spring in the claw and, therefore, the 4 stars instead of 5.OK, the boy is just over two, but he loves this toy. Even though he can hold the claw with a proper grip, he can't squeeze the handle because the spring is so strong. Certainly, he'll develop enough strength to actuate the claw; but, in the meantime, he uses it mostly to push and prod things. He also gets great joy out of having an adult use the claw to grab his toys, clothes, arms, or legs (yes, gently). It's just as good as tickling. Even the adults are a bit surprised at the level of grip required to use this toy claw.Bottom line: Well made for the price. Good fun and something that even a smaller child can enjoy and grow into."
2,Very Cheaply Made,My son's pevious robot claw that we got from Goodwill lasted over a year. It was more solidly built than this one. This one's casing is easily cracked as the plastic is very thin. It broke within a week of normal play. We had to duck tape the middle casing and reinforce it with some plastic rods. Would suggest buying this product at a toy store as you can tell if it is a sturdier make or not.
1,Broke in One Day,"Got his toy for my son age 2.5, it broke later that day. I was actually just ""grabbing"" with it and I heard a snap. DO NOT BUY."
5,Robot claw,My grandson would only put it down when his uncle took it over to play with it. It's a lot of fun!
5,Worth its weight in gold,"My son insisted he wanted a ""robotic arm"" for his birthday like the one his friend got. This was his favorite present! He uses it as fireman's equipment, a carpenter's tool, he grabs toys from under the bed, reaches things from high shelves, he chases his little brother with it. The claw does make a ratchet sound, but it's not nearly as annoying as many of the ""noise toys"" out there.Best 5 bucks we've spent on a toy in a long time."
5,An All-time Classic,"I purchased one of these long ago, when I was an ironic 20-something.Who would have guessed that 25 years later I'd be lending it to my life partner who is using it while she heals from her total hip replacement surgery, comma, left. Soon she'll be allowed to bend all the way to the floor and touch her toes again... until then, she is using ROBOT CLAW to pick up stray objects from the floor, and bottles and teaboxes and cans from the lower shelf of the pantry.This is no toy! This is an ironic hipster prosthetic aid. Durable, too."
1,Broke within 30 minutes,"My child wanted this silly thing, but it broke within 30 minutes. I figured out how to fix it, then it broke within an hour. Give this a miss!"
1,Not a toy,"So far as a grabber - reacher goes this product is a joke. I guess it's supposed to be a toy, but it's not a toy. It's doesn't pick up, grab or reach well, and in the hands of a child, could actually be used to pinch and hurt another child. It's not fun, it's dangerous and totally useless as a reacher-grabber."
5,Great Windshield,Bought this windshield for my honda shadow spirit and it fit perfect/looks perfect what more can you ask for? Price was just right and came with mounting hardware. The Seller was quick and responsive! Great Buy
2,not really safe,"I am sure this product works very well, but after reading the MSDS [...] with all of the warnings for poison control etc I do not feel comfortable using this product anywhere around my house. It may be ""safe"" for the environment, but I and my family and animals live in that environment and this product makes our plants unsafe for us. It may be all natural and approved for organic gardening but if I have to rinse my hand for 15-20 minutes under running water if I get a drop of it on my skin, that is not a good sign. If I could return it, I would. I think the seller of the product should provide some of this MSDS info on the web page to help provide a more informed decision, if I was at the store buying it I would have read the label and not purchased it. I learned my lesson to never purchase an unfamiliar chemical product online when I am not able to read the label."
1,useless!,this product did not work at all on white powder fungus like it claims and it didnt work on fungus gnats (fruit flies) either. they just frolicked and played in it like it was water. however it did hurt my plants. it burned the leaves of the ferns roses and Gerber daisies. i don't recommend it at all. still searching for a fungicide that actually works.
5,GARDEN SAFE FUNGICIDE AND INSECTICIDE,THIS PRODUCT HAS CONTROLLED THE FUNGUS WHICH ATTACKS HYBRID T ROSES CALLED YELLOW SPOT - IT ALSO CONTROLS JAPANESE BEETLES WHICH LOVE TO EAT BOTH LEAVES AND BLOOMS OF MY ROSES. IT IS VERY EASY TO APPLY. I HAVE TRIED LARGE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS TO CONTROL THESE TWO PROBLEMS AND THIS PRODUCT HAS WORKED THE BEST FOR ME.
1,Didn't do as advertised,"got the fungicide 3 to take care of a gnat problem. After two weeks, they are still here, and they seem to not mind the spray at all. So if you have problems with fungal gnat....do not bother."
4,Effective environmental friendly insecticide/fungicide,"Works well most of the time.There have been a few instances where it has not been effective, and we have had to resort to less environmental friendly means"
1,Will not repurchase,"Went through an entire bottle of this and it didn't do a thing for my gnat problem. My plants are still alive, but barely. Used on 3 different houseplants."
3,"Nothing special, either good or bad.","To be fair, I will agree that this does not read like a first novel. It is well-written, well-paced, reasonably well-plotted. The inherent quality is the main reason that I am giving it three stars instead of two or even one.Ultimately, I just did not find the book interesting. Many of the character elements were predictable, and I did not appreciate Billingham's attempt to make it interesting by making his killer even weirder and more cruel.It is unfortunately lately how many mystery writers seem to be relying on ever more shocking plotting instead of good characters to drive their novels. I may be being too hard on Billingham simply because I am annoyed by how much indifferent writing I have been reading lately. I think I would have forgiven Sleepy Head more readily had it been less obvious that Billingham is underneath it all a good writer."
3,Very British,"This was a great story, a great read, kept you in suspense and therefor it was very hard to put down, especailly the 2nd half. It was a new detctive type story with a different element. BUT.. it was very British. Meaning, written by a brit, it contains alot of british slang and geography so for those who arent very familiar it may be a bit confusing or even become boring, but if you can get past the slang the main objective is compelling and enjoyable."
3,"Truly innovative, but otherwise flawed","This is the 2nd Billingham novel I've read, the 1st being his latest, DEATH MESSAGE, and I will say that he does come up with original ideas. In this one, it's the idea of putting the victim in a type of coma without killing the person. I did find it disappointing towards the end and feel that he did do better with DEATH MESSAGE. Be that as it may, he does appear to be a writer to watch and to read."
3,3.5 stars - Good+,"Billingham has created some very interesting characters; Thorne, a relentless investigator who empathizes with the victims but is certainly not supercop; Dr. Anne Cobert, Alison's doctor who becomes Thorne's lover; and Alison herself. The dialogue is quite good as is the level of suspense-not over the top but done well in the right places. I already have Billingham's next two books and am looking forward to reading them."
3,Lose the coma dialogue and it gets 4 stars.,"No doubt at all that this book should freak you out, or scare you at the least. The idea of a nut running around and not wanting to kill you, but to throw you into a coma is pretty whacked. The opening dialogues before each chapter where the coma victim is talking, we're hearing her thoughts while she's in this state the killer has put her in, should have been deleted. It's cheesy and takes away from the storyline, I think. It's worth the chunk of change to read and have a nightmare or two, but here's another one that I would pass on to someone else or a used book sale. Great thriller/horrors that are worth keeping in the bookshelf, are hard to come by these days. Worth the read, but not worth reading more than once. The killer will freak you out though, good descriptions that make you glad it's just a book and the guy isn't stalking your neighborhood. 3 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF HORROR, USA."
4,"Well done, smart and unique.","Can't stop reading! I am not a crime drama fan at all, but this one got me interested in the genre. Good piece of modern thought-provocative entertainment."
2,Ehhhh...,"Unfortunately this book failed to excite me at all. It wasn't wonderful, it wasn't terrible - it was just... average. The plot was straightforward and without any complexities, despite some strange elements to the murders themselves. I had hoped that the title character of this series would stand out in some way, but I did not find him to be particularly sympathetic at all. His obsessive nature was off-putting, and it was difficult to muster up any positive emotion for him whatsoever. The cartoonish ending - complete with the villains full explanation of motive! - fell flat for me and added to the rather inauthentic vive I received from the entire book. It never felt ""real"" or even all that difficult to solve the mystery. For a debut to a series, it simply failed to intrigue me to continue on with it."
3,"Too slow, but not bad","The pacing was off in this novel, dragging out the insignificant when it didn't need to. These slow spots reflected badly on Tom Thorne, giving him stretches where he was a bit of a whining, dull, recidivist.When this book was hitting on all cylinders, it was an interesting read. The interludes with Allison and The Killer's POV were the best. Heading into the second half, things picked up momentum to what became an underwhelming climax.The writing itself was decent and the characterizations pretty good. I very much enjoyed that the author decided to take on something like locked-in syndrome, making this book different from the usual murder mystery out there. I am going to try and revisit this series sometime in the future."
3,Sleepyhead,"This book was very much like a favorite blanket that is coming undone. There were so many strings and characters feelings that really did nothing to add to the plot. I don't care how the main character felt about the loving couple he saw walking in the park that had nothing to do with the story. Too many details. Also, it could be the kindle format, but it took me a little bit of getting used to when the author changed character voices. Because he had to write something that would identify the speaker he added to the already overwhelming word count. I finished and thought the basic plot was good, there was just too much padding. It put the story in a miserable pace. I might try another story by the author but it will be a while."
3,Slow,"Written by an English writer and takes place in jolly olde England, many of the expressions he uses are very English so hard for us Americans to understand. Book is a bit slow in taking off but so far does hold my interest."
5,This book is about Love,"I found this book very uplifting and full of love. Animal love & humans love. Its all the same, it all comes from God. There are many wonderful stories. I would reccomend it."
1,Not Recommended,"I regret buying this book. This book was advertised in Spirituality & Insights, a magazine to which I subscribe. I bought it because I thought it was an insight into true stories about animals & how they'd spiritually communicated. What this book is actually about is a religion/cult that Harold Klemp, a self-prophesed prophet, calls ECK. These are fictional 1 1/2 page stories that could be bedtime stories for children. Not what I had in mind. I've read 2 stories & will read no further.I consider myself very open minded & am of no specific religion. I believe all faiths offer something. I dont like that this book was portrayed as though it would provide a defining insight that animals do indeed have souls. (I dont doubt that they do)If you want a nonfiction book about whether or not animals have souls, do not buy this book. If you're interested in ""ECK"" then buy this, cuz thats all it is promoting, nothing else."
1,This item is a bait and switch...,"This item is a bait and switch. The price seems great, but then Northstar Electronics will just cancel the order. I'm telling you from experience, do not buy anything from Northstar Electronics. Their customer service and policies are unethical."
5,Hours of FUN!!!,"We just bought this train for our 2yr old's B-Day and we can't get him off of it! My older son, who is 8, even likes to ride it, although we don't really let him since there is an age limit of 4 and are worried his weight of 60lbs might break it. He has gotten on and taken a ride with no problems, though. We bought the ""extra track"" so it makes a figure 8. It is so easy to put together and store. The train goes a safe speed and is very easy for our 2yr old to get on and off. He learned how to push the button to make it go right away. It will be nice to have inside during the winter as well. It seems to hold a charge for a long time. This is, by far, one of the BEST purchases we have made!!"
1,Disappointed,The front wheel doesn't spin smoothly. I've oiled everything that can be oiled and now it works somewhat decently but the tracks are all oily looking now. It doesn't ride smoothly. It's jerky and get's stuck on curved sections of track. Don't waste your money. It also looks very cheap. The pictures are way cooler looking.
1,Not much content,"This book claims to be updated, but most of the pictures appear to be straight out of the 70's. In any case, (the price) seems to be a bit much to pay for 32 pages of glossy pictures of the sides of buildings with a little text thrown in as filler. I can't imagine who would find this book useful. There's not nearly enough information to actually do anything, and most or all of what there is can be found in any decent text on building construction. I've ordered several Portland Cement Association publications and have been uniformly disappointed with all of them, as they contain little information combined with not particularly useful pictures and too high a price for the package."
5,a primer of Freudian phsychology,I purchased this book for my girls to use in a college class. Hopefully it will get a lot of use.
3,cover art,"I don't know about the story, but if that isn't the cutest baby on the cover I don't know who is."
1,Horrible,This book was a terrible read. It took forever with the same old ending. Don't read it it is over priced and one osf grahams waorsts books.
1,not so great unlike other her books,"There is no chemistry, no gut wrenching feeling between hero and heroine, not great readunlike other her books"
3,T-shirt thin bag with a little stretch.,"I am really picky about everything associated with laundry. :P Getting to my review I am not sure by what is meant by the term ""Jersey"" if they meant it is to resemble the feel of a t-shirt then they really hit the mark with this laundry bag, so just imagine a laundry bag that is just as thin a tee shirt but with a little more stretch to it. I believe it might have been woven with spandex. As I said before I am a persnickety when it comes to laundry and I expect a high performance laundry bag and this is far from it. Yet please consider my score of 3 is probably a 4 to a normal human being. SO if you are looking for a t-shirt thin bag with a little stretch to it this is the bag for you! Enjoy!JW"
1,Horrible Printing!,"the didn't even wait for the ink to dry on the pages before binding the book, which is why the words from each page are pressed against the opposite page. Absolutely unacceptable! Don't purchase from this publisher."
1,Save your money,"Save your money and buy another brand. This hand held doesn't have the suction to pick up anything. Well maybe very little dust bunnies. My neighbor bought it and it didn't work for her. She gave it to me to see if perhaps I could get it to work. If I would have bought this product, I would have returned it the next day!!!!"
3,"Not bad, Good for small Quick jobs.","Model:Dirt Devil Black Marked quick Power, Crevice tool 0896EDIGood for small jobs, my crevice tool is pretty good it hasn't snapped yet after about 6 months of use...Battery drain is fairly rapid ...it loses maximum power after 1 minutes and remains at 75% power for a good period of time."
2,This vacuum is weak,"No power to it. I'd run it across a few flakes in the carpet a bunch of times just to suck things in. When I emptied it, a bunch of dirt/crap came out. I guess it was picking something up. Just not what I wanted."
1,WORST VAC EVER.,"This vac is horrible! Sound has very high pitch note that makes my ear hurts, skinny attatchment got broke 2nd time I used. It doesn't make any click sound so hard to put it back. Now it doesn't go back in and became annoying object. Don't ever buy like this shape one! Buy something else that u can attatch and re attatch with other accessory part for vac. I just wasted my money... very disappointed."
1,very heavy,"I bought the more powerful 15.6 volt version of this to replace my old dustbuster. I never even tried it because it was ridiculously heavy. If you are planning on using it a lot, or have trouble holding and lifting things, find another handheld vacuum."
2,broke,This vaccum isn;t worth the price. The first thing to break was the crevice tool. It won't go back on when I use it for longer than five minutes it sounds like it's losing it charge. Buy som ething else . Next time I will buy black and decker.
2,not what I had expected,"I purchased this model to replace my black and decker one. It looks great, the suction isn't have as much as my old one. The thing I really hate about it is I wall mounted it and it keeps falling off of the wall, off of the cradle. Every time someone shuts the door , it falls off the wall. Now it looks like its 2 years old from all of the falls. I am going back to my black and decker next time."
1,BAD!!,"The hole in the end is way too small, it will hardly pick up crumbs. It's going in the garbage. I tried this because it was a little cheaper, never again will I deter from the Dustbuster brand, they've got it figured out.."
2,A Rather Negative Look at Motherhood,"I've read lots of pregnancy books, and this book came recommended as an ""honest"" view. It may be honest, but very negative!I realize that motherhood isn't usually the fairytale many of us hope it will be, but this book just dwelled on the negatives: sometimes you can't figure out breastfeeding, sometimes you worry that your husband might leave you, sometimes the baby won't stop crying....Hopefully there are more books out there that are more evenly balanced with ""real life"" stories. I recommend that you keep looking."
5,Great book on reality of motherhood,"I, too received this book as a shower gift and read it cover to cover before my son was born. I still think back to many of the insights and realities that women spoke of in the book. It was truly one of the only books, out of many, that I have read that talked about both the joys and sadness that come with being a mother. For those that want to move beyond the sugar coated how-to books, this is THE book."
1,"Honest, but Not Helpful","I was given this book by a well-meaning friend when I was pregnant with my first child. It was negative, depressing and offered no useful ways to deal with the difficulties of new motherhood.Every woman with half a brain should realize her life will change when a baby comes into her life, but to read this book and its ""Look! Lots of other people are miserable, too!"" theme does nothing to help the problems a new mother faces. Plus, to read something like this before a child is born does little more than diminish the joy and hopes a new mom may have. Let the kid himself diminish that joy, but don't do it to yourself before he even shows up on the scene!Can't recommend this one."
2,"Easy to install, parts damaged/missing",This was easy to install however the plastic spacer/washer is cracked. We needed to make a spacer to fit in between the tap and the inside of the refrigerator door. Without it the door would of been damaged through time and would eventually break.
2,Not very effective,"Maybe I just have stains that are too much for it, but this cleaner didn't seem to do very much, certainly not enough to warrant paying the extra for it versus normal cleaners. And I'm not using it on very old Le Creuset either, everything I have is less than a year old. Maybe it does better on older stains!UPDATE: I have used this product a few more times since I got it, and I must say it does seem to be doing a little better now that my cookware is a little older. Not sure why this is, but it definitely seems to help get off stains that normal cleaning does not. It does seem fairly caustic though so I do use gloves when cleaning with it and rinse a long time when done."
1,Save Your Money,This product does not clean or remove stains. It acts more like a polish. I had hoped it would help restore the beautiful colored finish on my grill pan but no luck. I got my money back and I'm getting used to the dark stains.
1,"You do not get what is described, titled, or pictured","I bought this ""Le Creuset"" cleaner, but received some other brand. I usually like Amazon over Ebay due to things like this, but I guess you find these types of sellers everywhere."
3,Not Le Creuset,"Contrary to the sellers picture, this item does not say Le Creuset anywhere on it. It does seem to work and it is significantly cheaper, but leaves us feeling cheated. See our pics for what you actually get."
3,Siege Chemical 766L Porcelain and Enamel Cleaner,"Not as good as the Phaltzgraff stone ware cleaner but it did make an improvement. If I could locate the Phaltzgraff cleaner, I would not purchase this again."
4,Great saucepot,"I have been looking for a 4-quart covered saucepot for long time. I am very satisfied with it, and I use it everyday."
3,What are those stains?,"Purchased this for it's very usable size (4 qts) and replacing a lost one we had. As fans of Farberware in the past, we thought stick with a winner. We received this promptly, no problem with Amazon. We then followed the ""first use "" instructions for cleaning. But when we used it for the first time, I was heating up saurkraut. for some reason, the interior sides and the inside lid stained a patchy gray/dark. Whether it was us, the saurkraut, or the pot, we're not sure, but the stain is there and we never had a problem like this before. We've tried scrubbing it out to no avail. We have been using it somewhat with no other problems besides the ugly stains. We thought about sending it back, but not worth the hassle of returning. No other problems. We'd give Farberware 4 to 5 stars in the past, and gave it three for this purchase just in case the problem was engineering or manufacturing and not the Saurkraut experience. or maybe it was the saurkraut?"
2,Plastic handles emit noxious fumes,"This would be fine except that every time I use it, the handles heat up and emit the most foul chemical smell. Unless I ventilate the room like crazy, I end up feeling nauseas, with a headache. I suspect that if our gas stove had smaller rings, this might not be a problem, but I can't be sure. In the meantime, I can't use it anymore. Totally toxic."
5,great product at great price,i priced this item in stores and on websites but this was the best deal. very happy!
5,Don't Lend This Pot To Anyone!!!!,"It performs very well. This is a great pot that I got as part of a set. I loaned it to my sister, and I have been waiting for her to return it. Looks like I'll have to go and get it. What I love about this piece of cooking equipment is that it still looks good over time. I purchased it back in the 90's, but you'd never know it by looking at it. Farberware makes good products. I own their vegetable peeler, and I have been given others, even ceramic peelers, but I come back to Farberware.It has a nice bottom that heats evenly, and I love to use it for cooking greens, or large quantities of other vegetables. I would purchase it as a wedding, house warming, or Christmas gift for someone who loves to cook. Just don't lend yours to anyone like I did, because it may not be returned."
5,Faberware Classic 4-quart covered saucepot,"I like the size, weight and quality of this sauce pot. This is the second pot, same brand, same size that I have purchased."
4,"Lee Konitz in a variety of settings,plays with great warmth","This is a wonderful album.It displays Konitz in a variety of formats and none of the recordings are dull or average.There are 6 tracks by a nonet,2 with the quintet and some duets with piano,alto,bass etc.The record was the result of Konitz appearing at a Jazz Festival in Denmark.Three live tracks from the festival are included.This type of pick-up grouping can often disappoint but this record has not left my CD-player for days because it is full of life and warmth and the variety of settings makes for an entertaining listen.Konitz fans will love it and newcomers will be pleasantly surprised."
2,Doesn't cut through even the lightest of fabrics,"These are extremely dull straight out the package. It won't cut through two layers of gingham. Complete junk if using for sewing, and isn't tht what most prople use pinking shears for?"
3,not sharp enough,I wanted a lightweight pinking shears. the handles are comfortable but I went back to my super heavy ones for cutting- maybe I'll use these on paper or something.
5,best relaxation CD,"I knew a stressful period was coming up for me so I bought several relaxation CDs to help me fall asleep. This one worked the very best for me. I have even fallen asleep listening to it several times. Very relaxing mental exercises, voice, and music. I highly recommend it.UPDATE: I've been using this CD for nearly five years. I fall asleep to it at least five nights out of seven. It's so useful, I bought a backup in case something happens to my first one. However, my daughter doesn't like it as she prefers to fall asleep to just music. (Picking the right relaxation recording is definitely a matter of personal taste.)"
5,Best I've Found,I have just begun meditating recently and have been downloading lots of guided meditations. This is by far the best. I am very picky about my guided meditations - anything distracting and I move on and try a different one. This one is very natural and has gotten me into relaxed state better than any other. Very Satisfied.
4,Drifting Downstream CD,"Nice hypnotic induction with small amount of visualization. The speaker has a pleasant calming voice. He brings a person back to alertness at the end which some may not prefer. However, the CD is still effective for deep relaxation (pre-sleep)."
3,Relaxing,This relaxation cd works well but not the best I've had. I do like his voice though so overall it is not too bad.
4,Kepler's Tribute to Copernicus,"In this volume, Kepler combines much of his work into what he believes to be a more accessible understanding of the planetary orbits. I would recommend this book for the serious student of Astronomy, because although it is less demanding than 'Astronomia Nova', it is quite in depth and certain adjustments are made to the Copernican cosmology which the reader must have some familiarity with. A final notice: this edition of the 'Epitome..' is only sections 4 & 5. The prior sections have never been brought into English."
3,Eh...,"They are cheap. The only thing I would say about these is that they are on par with happy meal toys. They are only a couple of bucks, so they are what they are. I gave them 3 stars, but I'd buy them again for this price."
5,good seller,very quick delivery & my daughter was very happy with them. it also brought back lots of memories for me too. i would buy from this seller again. Thanks
5,great for cakes!!,I made a MASSIVE care bear cake and used these as the toppers..they were perfect! Wish I could post a pic..cuz the cake was amazing..but these are very small..don't expect anything big! But definNTLY PERFECT FOR CAKES!.. i was nervouse they would be too small..but nope!!
3,daughters room,"I bought these to decorate my new born daughters room, I didn't realize they were super tiny, but I still love then and bought a lil shelf to put them on so its really cute"
2,not much on Czech horn players,"I purchased this book specifically to retrieve information on Czech horn players. It was empty of anything related to this topic, though there certainly are many biographies of other musicians from Czech regions."
5,Cheaper elsewhere,I like Amazon but you need to shop around. This same service panel can be bought new on the web for 158.00 delivered (Continental U.S.). I'm going to order one but not from here.
4,Toe socks,I bought these socks because my feet always slip during my body balance class. The socks greatly improved my ability to stabilize my feet and perform the maneuvers for the class. I recommend them.
4,ToeSox,"These socks are great for yoga, pilates, I've used them for ballitone. Sizing was difficult. They should have a better sizing chart. I wear an 8 shoe and the Medium fits me well."
2,Toe socks,The grip dots started coming off after the 4th time I wore them. Wore a hole in the heel after 2 months. This is the first pair of socks I have ever had wear out! I have other ToeSox brand with grips on them that I purchased directly from ToeSox before these. They still have all the grips on them and show no signs of wear.
4,Great for Barre Class,I use this in Barre class and the I find the toe grips very helpful. Plus with a little sock for each toe my feet have no problems staying warm.
2,I regret this purchase,"I bought these socks from FootSmart in order to get 'rush shipping'. They do not fit and the 'toes' are too long and hang over the edge. I really regret spending money on these, but I am stuck with them as I do not have time to get better ones before my yoga class starts."
4,Work well,I got these to keep my feet warm and not slip during yoga and they do just that. Very happy with my purchase.
2,slips off...,"It slips off when I used them.. (I am a size 8 and my feet are wide so you'd think it would be tight enough) Also, these socks are not for you if your toes are short and chubby like mine. (had to squeeze a few toes in but only on the right sock?? &my pinky toe was too short -_-)"
5,Love 'em!,"I wear a 8-8 1/2 shoe size and the medium fit just fine. I like the fact that they are NOT below the ankle and therefore are more stable and warmer. When walking your feet backwards in exercize routines, the toes come out of the toe pockets. I guess that is to be expected. I like them so much that I have ordered additional pairs."
4,Good but,"These socks are easy to put on and keep my feet comfy. However, when doing yoga poses with legs far apart the socks cut into the area between my toes and are uncomfortable. Otherwise, I like them a lot."
3,Teacher perspective of using Toe Sox,"As a Yoga Teacher you must move around the room to assist students with their asanas. Thus, is doesn't make sense to use a mat since you'd be off it most of the time. However, if you are working in a carpeted area, when demonstating asanas without a mat you could injure yourself if you slide or slip.Therefore, I decided to purchase the Toe Sox for two reasons:One, so I wasn't walking around in my bare feet and two since they have grippers on the bottom this would alleviate the slipping issue.Protection my feet was good but the only real issue with the Toe Sox is, since my pinky toes are on the short side my pinky toe comes out when demonstrating various asanas. However, the Toe Sox works well when you just doing more static asanas, such as Downdog.For the most part it does the job but is not ideal and why I rated it 3 stars. Amazon's price was as good as the original [...] site.NamasteYogadad"
3,Meh...,"These toe socks are okay. I bought these over the Gaiam version because another reviewer said these stay put on your foot better. That may be true because I still haven't tried the Gaiam socks but I wasn't thrilled with the way these stayed on my foot. So I wouldn't give them an A+ on that count. But the big thing I dislike about these is the cut. They're ankle-cut - I wish they were lower than that. I probably will try the Gaiam version eventually because I think they are lower. In terms of staying on your foot, I think the best thing is probably the version with open toes. So if you go to a studio that allows them, that's probably your best bet."
5,comfortable!,"Unfortunately, my feet are right on the edge between medium and large sock sizes. So... I tried the medium and even though they are skin tight, the toes fit perfectly and the soles grip on wood flooring really well. They were great for a yoga class but I did take them off half way thru, after I was warmed up. I will have to see how they are after a few washings and if they shrink any, I will try the larger size before I buy more. I am glad I picked this brand as it is a very well made product."
4,Yoga-Pilates Socks,"Great idea for those that do not like walking barefoot in a public place like the gym. Toe Sox give you the ability to ""feel"" the floor, spread your toes and keep your grip, while protecting your feet."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I'm not at all a yogi. I'm very new to the practice. So I thought these socks would be perfect in giving me some traction in holding some of the yoga poses. That really didn't happen. And in hot yoga, my feet got sweaty and would slip, even in these socks. I have since switched to the Vibram FiveFingers shoes. Those are much better and help me keep my grip."
1,"ToeSox full toe with grip yoga/pilates toe socks, black, large",Toes didn't fit properly. Traction wasn't good. There are other socks out there that live up to their claims. Stay away.
5,I love these things!,"ToeSox are invaluable for a Pilates junkie like me. Whether on the mat or the Reformer, ToeSox keep my tootsies warm, hygienic, and slip-free. I love that I can articulate each toe and move my feet in any direction, but still have the support of the grips; it's the freedom of socks with the stability of shoes. Plus, the pretty sock colors give me a focal point for my eyes while I'm torturing my obliques."
3,I love the toesox but...,I wear the ToeSox to teach all my Tai Chi classes. I teach on all types of surfaces from hard wood to carpet. Unfortunately I am finding the life of the sox is 9 wearings and then a big ole hole appears in the heel.
3,Fine socks,"I've been looking for socks to be able to go mat-free for many years, and so far have not found the ones. On a mat these are fine, and if you're borrowing a (dirty, smelly) mat from a studio, these are great, in that you'll be able to spread your toes and get good engagement. If you're trying to use them without a mat, the grip on wood is all-or-nothing, so you'll feel fairly stable and suddenly slide, as opposed to barefoot where you'll feel yourself slipping and be able to readjust."
2,Yoga socks,I bought these for my husband for yoga. He reports that they slip off in positions like downward dog. I'm not sure if the knee sock version would work out better.
3,Functional but not very durable,"I bought these to do the Yoga routine in P90x. I was having trouble with my bare feet sliding on the mat and with my regular socks twisting and coming off during the moves. This seemed like a great solution....and it is, except that they're not holding up that well. The little rubber nubbins on the bottom that give you grip are just flying off. By my third session, there weren't any left on my heel and the ball of my foot. Luckily, they still there in my arch and along the edges of my heel and toes and they touch just enough to give me some grip. They still functioning reasonably well (the only reason I have them 3 stars) in the final week, but that has really only been something like 13 sessions. If I was just doing Yoga on a regular basis, I doubt they'd still be useable. If they were only a couple of bucks I'd probably continue to buy them and just toss them out after a month or two, but as it is, I'll probably try something different next time."
3,Yoga & Pilates ToeSox/Toe Socks with non-slip sole,"I purchased the Toe Socks for sanitary reasons in a martial arts class. I found the toe socks very comfortable and well made. The socks were able to handle the twisting and turning needed for the movements required by the martial arts class, but the some of the non-slip studs on the bottom of the socks did not hold up (mostly on the toes). Approximately 95% of the non-slip studs are still on the sock after a pretty good beating in my class, so I can say without hesitation, that the sock would do very well in a Yoga or Pilates class."
5,My new slippers,"These are great. They're better than bare feet, support the feet when standing while doing dishes, and help exercise my big toes so they don't point inward. I wear them inside instead of slippers so I can keep my toes stretched and my feet warm at the same time. I'm going to buy more of the same."
3,Comfy & Fab... but short lived,"These socks are really comfy and fit well (I wear a size 7-7 1/2 shoe and I bought the small). THe little no-slip dots on the bottom work very well, but the problem is that they start coming off really quickly - within 5-6 uses, the dots on the ball of my foot and big toe are almost completely gone. They are great to start and a good stopgap, but I'm going to look for a more permanent solution."
5,Organic,"ToeSox Yoga / Pilates Toe Socks, Organic CottonGreat to wear in sandals. The five toe design promotes toe strength and flexibility. Great for yoga, pilates, dance and martial arts, as well as any other barefoot activity."
4,yoga sox review,"Very nice for wearing to the gym for yoga class when I don't know what's been on the floor or how recently it's been cleaned....I get a few odd looks, but clean feet!"
3,yoga socks,"I bought these thinking that they would provide protection for my bare feet and the floor. However, they are a bit uncomfortable when doing yoga and in some moves, my toes slide, forcing me to stop and adjust the socks. In about half of the classes, I just take them off and continue. However, I know someone in my yoga class who loves them.Toe Sox Women's Yoga / Pilates Socks, Pair"
5,"fit perfectly, pretty, work well to stop you from slipping","I used them yesterday in yoga class and they fit perfectly, kept me from slipping and helped cushion my feet"
4,Look weird - feel great!,"These look so weird and also feel weird when you first put them on but they are so much fun. I love them for my yoga class, and sometimes wear them at night watching TV because the separation they give your toes is good for your feet overall. Try them... you'll become a fan too!"
2,A number of improvements needed. but just ok.,"numbered not in order of importance.1) they shrink more than little if you wash them alot in warm water...this is especially a problem when it comes to putting on ""your toes"".2) the cotton is too thin for me and most good organic cotton socks like some of the Maggies line and it seems like it thins and fades too fast after use....more dense soft treated organic cotton needed!!!!!3) the protective studs are not dense enough to make for a breakthrough in 'sock technology'.4) t00 pricey for what they end up becoming.5) I recommend buying yourself one pair in a size larger if possible, and pick one with color (not white)"
1,no go,"Great idea, but poorly made. Material is thin and very restrictive. They seem to be sized for a very petite foot with long skeleton toes. The toes are tight, way too tight, and I bought both my ""correct"" size and a pair a size larger. I don't have fat feet, webs, or extra toes ;-), but I do have a wide footprint with short toes. The stiching doesn't ""give"" at all, there are seams at the toes, and they actually cut off circulation to the toes. Beware if you don't have ""perfect"" model's feet, or if foot care for a health issue like diabetes is a priority for you. I'm sure they probably fit perfect on some feet, but they didn't work out on mine."
4,Great product,"Great product; good grip; keeps my feet warm. If your feet fall in the ""in between"" sizes like me (size 8 or 8.5), go with the smaller one. This sock should be really snug on your feet or it loses the purpose."
4,Really neat for sweaty feet,"As someone who has a thyroid problem but truly enjoys yoga, the amount that I would sweat impaired my ability to concentrate during certain positions. These socks have given me confidence and the ability to relax into completing my stretch, rather than worrying I'm going to slip. Comfortable enough to wear around the rest of the day, my only problem is the toes can be a little itchy until they are washed a few times. I really like them overall though!"
3,Yes and No...,"The socks are good quality and feel fine. I like them, and wear them all day, but there is one problem that will keep me from buying them again. I used them for Yoga, and when I switched from one stance in one direction to another stance in the other direction, they twist just a bit, and after a couple of changes, it's enough to put a strangle on the toes, making them quite uncomfortable. I still like them, but I can't use them for Yoga anymore."
4,Great for pilates,"I recently began taking pilates & found that my feet got very cold & sweaty (now how can that be?) on the hardwood gym floor. Since regular socks can be too slippery I purchased two pairs of ToeSox & now my feet stay warm & toasty with no slipping on the floor. I will say, however, that it takes a while to get the sox on all of the toes. Also, the laundry instructions say wash inside out. I turn them inside out as I take them off, but turning them right side out after washing & drying can be a bit painstaking."
2,Not For Me,"ToeSox Yoga / Pilates Toe Socks, Organic CottonI have practiced yoga for several decades. I purchased these toe socks based upon reviews and price. Goodness, I spent way too much time just trying to sort out my toes - kept getting either two toes in one sleeve or finding my little toe sleeveless. Finally deceided to continue barefoot or in a leotard. Inexpense enough to just throw away:-)"
2,Don't bother,"I practice mostly hot yoga. Imagine sitting in a 94 degree room with 40% humidity and doing yoga. The last thing you want to have on your body is unnecessary clothing, including these socks. I much more recommend purchasing a yoga mat towel that has the same sticky studs on the bottom to prevent slippage.I only wear these socks around the house, instead of slippers. That's all they're good for. At least they're not completely worthless."
2,Yoga sox review,THe sox are OK just don't fit my feet. How can I return them to Amazon for a credit?
3,Do not follow the sizing chart!,I followed the sizing guidelines as I am a 9.5 womens and it said medium. I've never worn a medium anything. The socks are TOO small! Now what do I do?
4,Toe Sox,"Great accessory for the winter. It keeps your feet warm, while helping you with an extra grip."
1,TOE SOXS Made in China,"Socks, Made in China..for Yoga? Come now.. Yoga should be done in Bare feet.. But the Fact that this Company makes Socks.. simple socks in China is enough reason to avoid them.. Besides they are made very cheaply.Seams come apart.Sticky falls off the bottom.And they Run very small..Beware TOESOX made in China.. Not a very well built product at all.."
2,Worked good until they fell apart,"They worked surprisingly good at first, but soon the grips rubbed off and the socks are falling apart. I do martial arts and it's pretty intense, so maybe for something like yoga where you're not running and jumping around it might be good. For me, I'm looking for something else."
4,"Fit, even if you've had foot surgery!","I've had surgery on more than a dozen sites on my feet. My toes are fused. Yet these socks are comfy and with a little help from your fingers, the toes even fit. They also provide traction on oriental rugs. I'm going to buy more for me, and some for my husband, too, who just got into yoga!"
1,"Terrible, very low Quality","These socks would have been perfect, but I have used them once, and the rubber spots on the bottom are already falling off! Try another brand!"
5,Work great!,"I purchased these socks to use in pilates class. So far they work great! I'm able to stay put on the mat and floor exercises without sliding out of place. I've washed them a few times and they have kept their shape, fitting like new. I don't put them in the dryer, letting them air dry instead."
4,Comfortable,"These are a cute color and very comfortable... minor comment. I also own socks that have lines that run across them (and place where toes meet the ""foot""). The lines are great as it is a visual aid to keep your legs parallel for certain moves for pilates and yoga (I tend to rotate by legs a bit)...So in the future, I would only buy the socks with the lines..."
2,Good for many things but not for yoga,"These sox are warm, very well vented and have a good grip on hardwood floors. Yet they fall of your feet the minute you do warrior one. So not good for yoga"
3,Runs small,"Order up a size if you are any where near the 'top' of the recommended shoe size... otherwise, nice. Giving these to a friend with smaller feet and I ordered up a size."
5,Great for non-slip walking,I generally go barefoot at home - these socks are like a second skin - easier to put on than I thought even though my toes aren't perfect. Great for non-carpeted floors. I just love them.
5,sturdy footing,"I cringed a little at the price, but after trying them out for a 90 minute session and some poses I always felt unsure doing for not trusting my footing.. Very pleased with how sturdy these toe socks are.. Gave me the extra confidence to give 100% during my session. They were comfortable too. (thumps up from me) will buy more.Just wanted to update my review since the price was a huge hesitation for me, I have used these toesox at least 3 times a week 60 to 90 minute yoga sessions since they arrived back in Nov /10 they have held up until this week end of (Feb/11) I noticed I had worn down the nobs to be loosing footing on the mat not a sticky mat.. Feel I got my moneys worth for the price.. always hand washed them and air dried.. Ordering from them again."
5,Absolutely best children's songs!!,This CD is filled with 20 great favorites. My little girl absolutely loves the songs!!! I even enjoy singing to them! I would never get sick of listening to this music collection. If anyone knows of any other Childrens Songs by The Countdown Singers...please let me know! This was my BEST buy ever!!
3,educational but a bit boring,It's informative but the narrator seems like an amateur. Good for an introduction to an African studies class but not very entertaining.
5,Love the Primitives? Love This!,"This was not an easy CD for me to get ahold of - I think I had to send away to Amsterdam or someplace like that - but it was worth it.For anyone who loves the Primitives and really wants to hear a great compilation, this is it. All their best, with a hidden track at the end that I adore."
4,"clear, engaging book on the physics of sound, esp. music","This book presents its material in an engaging and clear way, very interesting, but you must ignore certain outdated assertions in the introduction.It's a solid general reference on the physics of sound (music in particular) from instrument through air to the ear. It predates cognitive science, it doesn't address that."
4,Right on the money,This book gives you a heads up into many different situations that one could quite possible find in a real world situation and makes you aware of the potential havoc that can be created from improper estimating.
5,This is a super CD,"I found this to be one of TJW's best CDs. It ranks right up there at the top. Everything TJW does is great, but this is a little more blues and the lyrics are great."
3,Nice Design - Poor Quality Glass,"The design of these Mikasa martini glasses is festive and fun.Each one is adorned with a different sand blasted pattern. My favorite is the spiral - kind of like the cartoon symbol of confusion after being hit over the head.But the execution is not good. Each glass contains bubbles, a definite no no in what's presented as a quality product.That having been said, salut!"
4,Good Value,Exactly what I was looking for and was unable to find from brick and mortar merchants.They come in a really big box though
2,Chips Easily,The appearance of these glasses is quite appealing however one of mine chipped when the edge barely touched one of the others while putting it in a cupboard. I was excited to find them because I hadn't had a lot of luck finding nice looking glasses in this size volume (10 ounces) but I can't really recommend something this fragile.
2,big and heavy,This review is all opinion.they are heavy and need to spread hand wide to grasp these and use.I bought the Luigi Bormioli set and prefier them.They make good gifts! :-)
1,Classy Glasses,Just the right size.High Quality.Fantastic Unique etching.These are a fun set of glasses.
4,Crash course in Household Spanish,"The course is great if you already have a little knowledge of conversational Spanish. I really learned a lot from it. The first CD goes through basic Spanish at a very rapid pace. I never studied Spanish in school. But I have previously gone through the entire Pimsleur Spanish courses, Levels 1,2,3, so I already know some very basic Spanish. This course is excellent if, like me, you have a little knowledge of Spanish to begin with. It's at a fast pace, and it adds lots of vocabulary relating to specific household duties that I didn't pick up in the Pimsleur courses. If you have no knowledge of Spanish, William Harvey has some other videos and CDs that would be good to review before tackling this one."
5,What a Great Gift,This book makes a great gift for any body who is interested in the movie. It is easy to read and is sutable for any age group!
1,A Guide to the Passion: 100 Questions About The Passion of T,One word crap! The belief that Jesus died for original sin was created in the 5th century by Augustine. Dogmatic Christians have been lead like a bunch of blind sheep to follow this hollow doctrine. If your a Christian why don't you do yourselves a favor a lookup Attis or Mithras and maybe you will finally see who and what you are worshiping
2,No substitute,The first Lenmar battery I bought held a charge for at least 4 hrs. I had it about a year or so and when it died I decided to order another. I'm lucky if this one lasts 2 hrs. So you actually take your chances when ordering. My laptop is old and I didn't want to go for the cost of an Apple battery
3,Works fine...other reviews not accurate of product i recieved,Product does indeed hold its charge for a decent amount of time and the color matches my aluminum powerbook fairly well. The bottom of the battery I is plastic and its a very tight fit into the battery compartment and requires a little fidgeting to lock into place. I also noticed it slightly protrudes out of the right side of the laptop contrary to other reviews on this product.
3,"It's plastic, and it doesn't fit.","It's a battery, that works like a battery, but definitely does not seat well into the powerbook at all.Lots of work done to get this thing to almost fit perfectly."
4,Decent choice for the price,"The battery works and holds a reasonable charge (about 2.5 hrs), for the price I cannot complain. I know I am hard on batteries which certainly will reduce my charge performance."
3,"Better Than A Dustbuster, But Not Great...","The Dirt Devil Scorpion is a decent hand vac in the sense that it picks up more than the average dustbuster, however I don't think it's the best hand vac you can buy out there on the market. The flip down crevice tool is a convenient feature on this, since you don't need to store it elsewhere. Nice idea. My main complaints on this model are the fact that the suction hole is very small (about 2""x1""), making it hard to pick up an area without going over the same spot 3-4 times. Also you can't rinse out the inside filter cup without destroying it, and the manual tells you not to do so. You can only shake the dust off or brush it off, which isn't so easy to do. It is very light and portable, however & easy to hold on to. Not the best, but not the worst."
4,Very Good Cordless Vaccum,"Quite a nice vac, but only good for small jobs. It doesn't have a big nozzle to pick up big things and the crevice tool helps for small things. Has a lot of power and sucks up everything well. Great with NO CORD!"
2,"Weak, not worth it","Poor suction power, doesn't hold much of a charge, difficult to get it to sit just right in the base, so that the contact will charge. It does work, but definitely not worth the money."
1,Lasted 4 months,"Nice while it worked but after using it a dozen times, the turbin started chafing against the housing and it stopped working: after opening, we concluded it was a very poor design."
2,Don't waste your money !,"I am returning mine today. I agree with rating above...I bought it on the cheap, and cheap is what I got. It's very loud, to the point I have to wear ear plugs. The suction is awful and it blows more that it sucks. The crevice tool broke off - which is why I'm returning it today. Very poor design. Trying to fit it into the base each time is annoying. My fault - I knew I was taking a chance paying so little."
2,Inconvienient,"This product was really nice until I needed a replacement filter. I've tried the store I bought it from as well as every other appliance store in my area with absolutely no luck finding the filters. If you buy this, it worked well for me, but be sure to stock up on the filters, Amazon has been the only place I've been able to find them."
2,"works decently, but poor construction","this vacuum worked decently (picked up cat litter and dust but wasn't so good with hairs) for about 4 months before the flip-down crevice nozzle broke off. and after owning the thing for 8 months and using it a couple times a month, the latch that holds the nose to the handle (which you open to empty the debris) broke off, so the vacuum is completely broken. i called customer service and determined that it would be cheaper and less of a hassle to buy a new hand vac than to ship it to them for repair/replacement."
2,NOT VERY GOOD!!!!!!,"First off, it does not pick up very well as the suction isn't very good. It will pick up most everything (but not everything) once you've gone over it about 5 times...and I'm talking about very light weight crumbs. The charge doesn't last long at all, and it has to stay plugged into the charger at all times in order for you to use it when you need it. It's a nice little vacuum for my 3 year old though. She loves it!! She vacuums the stairs for me and I'm not too scared of something being sucked up that doesn't need to be =)"
4,Epson compatible ink cartridge,Initial use of this ink cartridge shows it to be as stated. The last compatible cartridge I purchased locally showed only a 50% ink supply after installation in the printer. This one reflects 100% ink supply and printouts are sharp and clear.
1,Leaks!,This watering can leaked on either side of the spout and below the spout stem near the bottom. It also rusted after 1 use.
2,Rusted and leaks,It's a very pretty watering can BUT it started rusting as soon as water hit it.It also leaks in several places.
4,Dreamlife review,"Dreamlife is the story of Kacie, her family and her uncle Evan, whose vendetta against ""fixing"" in boxing establishes the tension in the book. The tale opens with Kacie, a high-school aged woman, performing stunts for a movie production in Hollywood. Soon she's back home in San Antonio, Texas where her life spirals out-of-control as her uncle moves against figures involved in fixing fights in professional boxing.The plot moves at an even pace, spiced with the myriad of colorful details that the many-faceted author garners from his eclectic life. Different aspects of Dreamlife include martial arts, esoteric flower information, snowboarding/skiing and the enterprise of dealling in latin-american antiques, as well as boxing, movie stunt-performing, the literature of Joyce Carol Oates and the cuisine of Korea. Indeed, there is something for everyone."
4,Bearing in mind these are essays,"The book is good for what it is - Ms. Morris' impressions on a variety of Canadian cities, not a full-fledged guide to Canadian travel or culture. I borrowed it from the library, but would recommend purchasing a copy for a couple of bucks."
4,Sushi Magic Sushi Making Kit,"No way to tell as yet, I have not used it. It looks good, however, the Nori rolls look as difficult to use as the old bamboo mats. I much prefer the Sushezi tool, which I also purchased from Amazon. The rice moulds look like they would be a great aid and appear very easy to use to make sushi with a topping."
1,Poor,"The way the product appears to customers, it seemed I was getting a whole sushi kit--with the chop sticks and plates and when I received this product, it only has 2 plastic pieces. Not worth the money and I thought the packaging was very misleading."
4,Easy & Fun,"We had some friends over for a sushi-making party and this was a hit. The kit is easy to use and comes with everything needed for making basic sushi except the fresh ingredients. It takes a little practice to get the rolls to come out just right but the mat really helps the rice to not stick. If you have an Asian market and a good, fresh seafood counter nearby you can make surprisingly tasty and professional looking sushi at home. In the end nothing beats a real, skilled sushi chef and it is just faster and easier to go out to your favorite restaurant... but this makes for an entertaining night in with friends or a date and is a really fun alternative every once in awhile."
3,Not What Expected,"Price was fair, shipping was fast. The product itself is cheap - the handle always comes apart when rolling sushi. I have tried the Nigiri part yet. The mat gets sticky and dirty from rolling one sushi and you can't simply wipe down - you have to wash off. I am wondering if I would have been better off with a bamboo rolling mat??? Vendor was easy to deal with and no complaints on their behalf. Okay product - a little disappointed at the ""cheapness"" of it."
5,Pretty slick,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend this much on a sushi roller, but I am glad I did. It reallyworks great. Easy to use, great results."
4,Martin Fletcher is the bad guy of the year,"John Ramsey's debut novel shows us the disturbing and often revolting mind of corrupt DEA agent Martin Fletcher. Violating the Socratic rules of fiction, Fletcher kills women and children in his quest for revenge. His violence is not excused by the rather traumatizing experiences of his childhood, in fact it makes him all the more evil. In Fletcher, Miller has produced the most thouroughly evil and dangerous bad guy of the year.The low point of the novel is the rather contrived and all-too-neat ending, which lacks the depth that characterized the rest of the novel.Fans of other writers as varied as Tom Clancy and Ronald Kessler with appreciate this novel."
3,A belated review,"The trend in fiction today seems to be in presenting protagonists who are morally flawed, sort of like Ishmael in MOBY DICK, who nonetheless rise above their shortcomings to persevere. This is what John Ramsey Miller has achieved in THE LAST FAMILY.While certainly not on a par with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, this novel is certainly a cut or two above the standard fare within the thriller genre, with a high, original concept and one of the best baddies since Hannibal Lecter and Lyle Pointer.The ending, too, seemed telescoped, gotten over with, unsatisfying, which marred the whole book and largely invalidated what Mr. Miller had worked so hard to set up. The main problem I had while reading LAST FAMILY was that there was not one character in it that I liked.However, the book has one of the best closing lines I've ever read. I'll certainly give Mr. Miller's next book a chance."
3,Typical Action Yarn,"If you are a fan of action thriller novels you likely will enjoy reading ""The Last Family."" Relatively standard fare here - highly flawed hero leads an elite force to hunt down a super-villain before he can murder one last family. While being very readable, author John Ramsey Miller doesn't offer anything really original (character-wise nor dialogue-wise) - nothing that you haven't read before. The plot had real possibilities but sort of fell apart as the supposed super-elusive villain gets caught in a relatively standard manner thus diluting the climatic suspense. Still, if you are looking for a good, quick read ""The Last Family"" wouldn't be a bad choice."
2,"Too much hype, not enough reality. Generally sucks.","Was recommended by Larry King in his newspaper column as a super, fast, unbelievable read. I found it was too contrived and not even remotely reality based.Tried to be an action thriller but never got there. I couldn't wait to finish it but I sure had a tough time getting there. Thank goodness for skimming! It sure was not worth the money I spent on it The next time I read a review and tout by Larry King, I'll do some further research before buying the book. This is the author's first novel. If there is another one, it had better be better than this one. John Grisham, rest easy, your throne is still safe"
1,"A quick, lame read","This book is the stereotype of suspense thrillers, which should be read while watching television, as it doesn't justify your full attention. If John Grishim wrote a serial killer book, this would be it. A good read if you need a distraction or have a short attention span."
3,Well... all right as a diversion.,"Let's say Stephen Hunter's next novel isn't due for a few months,and you've outgrown Tom Clancy and Morrell's tired rehashinghas made you yearn for a little diversion.So pick this up and be diverted. You won't be really satisfied,but you won't feel as if you've read this before until abouthalfway through. I'd like to see something else by the author,hopefully with this criticism stinging him whilst he writes."
1,Unbelievable Thriller,"I picked this up after reading the reviews on the back (Larry King and People Magazine should have warned me) and after a great opening was sadly disappointed by ridiculous characters, stupid plotting and bad dialogue. About halfway through I started reading every second sentence, then every second paragraph. It was still too long. Would have been much better if Paul Masterson hadn't had the full force of the DEA/FBI/CIA and (what were they thinking) Tod Peoples behind him. Makes John Grisham look like John LeCarre."
1,Was broken every time it was shipped,I had to place the order twice on this light. It was broken in shippment each time I received it. It looks like it would be a very nice addition to any umbrella covered out door table. The light is made of glass a rare find these days. I am amazed it was not made of plastic. I believe Amazon discontinued this item until the manufacturer gets their act together and provides better packaging.
2,Not so easy to understand!,"I bought this book for ""life data analysis class"" (it was required). Unfortunately the book has not been as helpful as the professor and the students thought it might be. You have to go through many chapters to understand one concept, and according to my professor the second version of the book is not better than the first one.If you are into the field of life data analysis it might be good but I don't recommend the book for someone just starting."
2,jersy shirt,nice product great n fast shipping. had problems returning for a different size and took forever when i had to return it to get my money back
5,Awesome Product,"Excellent product, good quality and much more than I was expecting. The size sold fits really well and I so happy with it."
4,Jersey,All be it this is a jersey for a team I never root for and was picked up as a gift. I must say that the size and the timely fashion that this jersey arived in were perfectly acceptable.
2,good..but,"Ensignia is very rough. My daughter will wash it, hoping it'll softenMy grandson likes look, but not so much the feel!"
4,great companion to Riddle of the Wren,"This is a wonderful book! Its not exactly a sequel to Riddle of the Wren, but set in the same universe, with the same hoary feel to it. Not one of his more well-known books, but I loved it as a kid and still do. Both are a definite must-read if you love old high fantasy."
5,I love this series!!! ^_^,"I love this series!! ^_^ It's really cool! I just think it's awesome! However, one thing to say. You should buy the one that says, ""Saint Seiya"", NOT the dubbed American one which goes by the title of ""Knights of the Zodiac"". The reason I say that is because that's closer to the original series, probably at least. ^_^Bseides, you get lots of cool extras on the Saint Seiya DVDs. ^_^ Also, if you like old anime, like, Ronin Warriors, you'll love this."
5,Pimsleur - Quick & Simple German,Good product for quickly learning basic use of German language.Very satisfied as I was with both the Italian and French courses.
5,"Fun, fun, and more fun!","An all-around GREAT book, whether you're male or female, gay or straight. Answers questions you might not have the courage to ask, and teaches techniques that will be VERY well recieved, all in a very easy-to-follow, entertaining and unoffensive way. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age!"
3,You have to WANT to quit.,"I bought these cds a few months ago when I stopped smoking.The hypnosis cds are just ok.The cds are simply a tool. You have to WANT to quit and you must be determined to quit. I learned a little more about hypnosis and relaxing-- rather than how to stop smoking.If you are looking for help with stopping smoking, I highly recommend the book called ""Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" by Allen Carr."
1,Video Amar Prem,"Two Indian movies were ordered as a package deal.Kati Patang was a fine quality printAmar Prem was a very bad print. I was much disappointed,"
3,"Couple of Good Songs, Album as a Whole Not So Great","I heard the song Sunset on Pandora and really liked it, so I bought the album off Amazon. I was really disappointed. Sunset is still a good track and the first couple of tracks also weren't bad, but on the whole the album ended up sounding like kind of a mixture of the Eurythmics and the Cure (their darker, weirder material). If you like the sound of that, buy the album, but for me it was pretty unlistenable - I ended up wishing I'd just downloaded the one song I liked."
3,okay,"This book was okay, but it seemed to just skim the surface. It just needed a little more meat to it."
2,Too much clutter in the date boxes,"Cute calendar, we love the Simpsons, but every day's box is cluttered with type telling of just about every event that exists around the world. White Shirt Day? Crab Race Day? Who the heck needs to know about that??? I prefer a 'clean' calendar where I can write my own events without all the 'clutter' making the calendar look sloppy.I'll avoid this one in the future."
4,Great calendar,"I buy The Simpsons calendar every year because it has everything. Every celeb birthday is recorded and so is EVERY holiday. I love the pictures of The Simpsons, but I have one complain, in December there is no Christmas picture. I always wonder why, oh well.Great calendar for The Simpsons fan. Highly recommend!!``Kat"
1,the remastered disaster,"We ordered this remastered version with great anticipation, thinking it would excell the original. However, we were extremely disappointed. Not only is the sound quality mediocre, it is actually inferior to the original 1996 version. Don't bother getting ripped off like we were."
2,Not much there,I have used the commentary series by MacArthur and really like them but this is very dissapointing! More like a brief study guide without much to it (Very little more than a good outline).
5,Good Book,I've really enjoyed this book since receiving it. It has some really nice pictures and the captions/text are helpful too. And I got it at a great price on Amazon. Thanks!Kevin Cuccia
1,Veratex Serrano King Duvet,"I was a little disappointed with the veratex serrano king duvet. It is not a very functional product. Every time I make the bed I have to be careful not to snag the comforter. A broken fingernail can pull the loops of the duvet. I've done this twice already, within the last month. In addition, the comforter inside the duvet slides around a lot, so it is very bulky in places. I love the colors, in the comforter, which go great with my decor, but the cost for beauty is low functionality. In addition, if you purchase the king duvet and have a king size bed, the fit may not me that great if you have deep mattresses like mine. I really could have used a Cal King. I read the previous review prior to making my purchase, but decided to take a chance, since I wanted this style so badly. They were right.Veratex Serrano King Duvet Cover"
2,Bulky,The duvet is has a pleasant appeal but it is heavy. It is hard to position the down comforter in it and keep it centered. This causes the duvet to be bulky in areas not giving it a smooth appearance with lumps throughout the lay of it. Haven't tried the regular comforter for the ensemble but if I could do it over again I would go that direction.
5,For the love of Zion!,This is a collector's book worthy to be on your library shelf. Those who love the beauty of Zion National Park will treasure this book. The illustrations are beautiful and the presentation of the book and binding make it look like something special --- which it is. It is so fortunate time was taken to preserve this information and history in this beautiful manner.
2,"MORRIS IS SEXY, BUT THE PLAY WAS OK","The play gets three stars. The singing gets two stars. The price for the dvd should have been lower. Overall, I give this play two stars because of the singing."
3,It was ok,I must say that I actually go this DVD because of Morris Chestnut and it was not what I thought it would be. This was the first play that I have seen on DVD so maybe it just did not have to same affect like if I was actually in the audience. The story line was ok. My husband did not like it atol. To each its own.
4,Fuzebox,I love the cd very much. these guy's have something new to say! I have not heard anything like it before i hope they keep up the good work!
5,This is a great coloring book!,"This is my favorite coloring book. I've already colored five of them and I'm looking for another. If you like Lion King, this is for you."
5,Squishy soothing balls for achy hands.,"I wasn't sure I'd like this thing when I got it. The ball's a little tacky and gooey. However, that said, it's stood up to some pretty agressive use. I'm a massage therapist, and my hands ache at night after eight to ten hours of work. This ball helped ease the pain and stiffness that developes in my finger joints, especially the first joint, near the fingertip where I have arthritis. It's also fun just to squish it from time to time for the joy of squashing something. Very useful and durable for normal useage."
2,Not that G'day Gourmet Tuna taste I was hoping for!,"I loved G'day Gourmet Tuna in Tomato Onion and Salsa Tomato. Since they are not available, I ordered this Safcol Tomato Salsa in hope to substitute the G'day Gourmet. Not even close! Watery, salty and not as tasty. Alas..."
4,For Pastors of small churches,This American book also has much within it to help pastors of small churches in Great Britain. One of the great benefits of the book is that it is very practical and emphasizes the servant role of the pastor.
1,Missing Key Map,"This editionis missing the map entitled, ""Bony's Key Plan' which is in the front of previous editions. (The first page of this edition is page 7.) Without this map is would be difficult to follow the solution of the crime."
1,Try the Eureka 71A instead......,"I was going to by one of these dirtdevils until I read the reviews. My parents have one of the older models of this unit with the two ELECTRIC motors. A turbo brush is useless. After reading the reviews and searching, I bought a Eureka 41A handheld. That one surpassed my expectations by far and it has a powerful brush (which can be turned off witht the flick of a switch for hard surfaces), it has excellent suction, a crevise tool, and on-board cord storage. It's in a whole different league from the dirt devil for only a few dollars more."
4,Dirt Devel Power Reach Hand Vacuum,"My daughter requested this for her birthday. Instead of shopping around town I checked web sites for the most reasonable price. As always AMAZON.COM had IT.Quick delivery to my house since I work long hours it saved me lots of time.My daughter, of course loved it. She has a kirby and it is very awkward on stairs so she uses the Dirt Devil and says it does a great job.I always go for the free shipping offer and I still get my products fast that I order through Amazon."
1,This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever bought!,"I'm an engineer and I cannot believe that any company would, in good conscience, fob off such trash onto the consuming public. The reasons for the faulty performance are all based on fatally flawed design. A product with this many problems does not reach the market by accident. They had to have known it was junk, but chose to sell it anyway. Dirt Devil deserves the strongest form of rebuke and condemnation."
3,"OK vacuum, but not much brush action.","This item works pretty well, but unlike other small, corded Dirt Devil vacuums, this one's power brush is operated by air instead of a belt causing it to be much less effective."
1,Worthless - A broom is better!,I owned a DD handvac 20 years ago that was wonderful. Bought this unit last year and it barely cleaned from the moment we opened the package.It has a filter core that immediately collects all the debris around it and clogs which causes the rotary brush to stop spinning and reduces the air suction power to almost nothing. Really bad engineering design. Do not buy this unit! Complete waste of money.
1,Revolving Brush does nto revolve,"The vaccuum itself works fine, but the 'air-driven' rotating brush is as useless as can be. After one use, it is clogged up with dog hair and does not spin anymore. Even when it does spin, it does nto spin with any amount of force, i.e. you can stop it with your finger or just by pressing it against anything, (like the carpet it should be cleaning)A better choice is the 'Ultra' model with a powered head. It is cheaper and works far better. But it needs bags."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this for de-hairing my couch of pet hair. While it did so once or twice withouth much fuss, you spend an amazing amount of time trying to de-hair the filter. They say to just pound out the filter and the debris will fall out. Right.Worse is that the power nozzle section just up and quit. Try to debug the issue on their website is pointless. All you can do is try to re-align the hose back and forth....no change. So now I have this pointless little mini-vac.Save your time, money and frustration. Move along to something else. There's a reason why this thing has so many negative reviews."
1,So Disappointed!,"I needed a handheld with a rolling brush to get the cat hair off my couch. The brush is okay as long as I VERY lightly touch it to the cusions. The problem is, if I put ANY pressure on it at all, the brush stops moving! I even put my hand against the brush and, you guessed it, it stops moving!This product does not have enough power to keep the brush rotating.Also, the filter idea is a bad one if you have asthma. The filter gets coated with dirt and hair but the instructions say NOT to ""wipe"" the filter so you have to vigorously tap it out in the garbage which creates a cloud that gets inhaled."
1,not very practical,Used it three times & gave it away. the filter clogs too easy. I had an old one with a cloth bag and that one lasted 10 years. That's what you should look for.
1,Not worth a single dime!,"This is the second Dirt Devil Hand Vac that I have owned. I bought it to vaccuum my car's interior. I've used it very little, mostly because its suction ability is next to nothing and therefore, using it is a huge hassle. The hose is way too short, the head is too bulky, making it difficult to have good alignment between the brush and the surface you're trying to vaccuum. Even the hose attachments hardly suck up any dirt or dust. It's a waste of money and I've been so dissatisfied with it that I will NEVER buy another Dirt Devil product again."
1,Rotating brush broke/stopped for 2nd time,"This Dirt Devil Power Reach is a lousy product. This is the 2nd time the rotating brush quit on me. First time it was string wrapped around it to hold it from moving. I took it all apart to remove the string. Now this 2nd time it must be the bearings are shot, as there are no obvious materials holding it from spinning. Even though it was a gift for which I was grateful, I'm getting rid of this thing & finding a better vac, because good luck in finding a local authorized repair shop. Dirt Devil gives them so little money for fixing them they want to charge more than the product was originally."
1,One more NO vote,"I bought this unit several years ago for spot vacuuming. Right out of the box, the primary vacuum head didn't work, but the hose/crevice tool configuration worked fine. I should have returned it! WallyWorld stopped carrying the filters and didn't restock this unit within a year of purchase - a bad sign. While looking for replacement filters - that are spendy if you can't find them locally - I discovered the motherlode of negative reviews here and realized that the units probably should have been recalled as defective. I was remiss in not checking for consumer feedback before purchase. Also agree that the unit isn't very effective at picking up dirt/dust/lint either, despite company claims."
1,No suction and the brush does not work,This is the worst dirt devil product I have owned. Their descriptions lead me to believe that it would work fantastic. It has little to no suction especially when the filter has the least amount of dirt. The brush does not work. This is the feature I was counting on to pick up cat fur. The power reach with the brush attachment is very awkward to use. The only redeeming feature is when the crevice tool is attached without the brush attachment. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Worst Piece of Crap I ever bought,"A vacuum cleaner needs two things .. suction and firm brushing. The suction isn't great but workable, however the brushing is horrible. The air driven brush hardly has enough power to spin itself, and when touched to anything at all, the brush stops. Can't believe Dirt Devil actually sells this product. I will never buy another one of their products again -- they make terrible decisions about what works and what does not. This does not."
1,Complete waste of money,"I bought this vacuum to clean my staircase and our cars. I selected this item because of the detachable head with the spinning brush.Well, to make a short story shorter, it broke after 5 minutes. The brush head just stopped spinning and wouldn't spin again. The belt didn't break, not exactly sure what happened. This occured under light use.For about 4.5 minutes, I was impressed by the unit, because the filter seems good and the motor/suction powerful. BUT, there is a major design flaw with the detachable head to have broken so easily.I am really disappointed. I never bought a Dirt Devil product before this one. I had always heard good things about their products. This one is a real dud, however.I would strongly recommend that you consider another hand-held vacuum, to save you the time and trouble of having to return this one."
1,Worst Hand Held Ever Owned,"I bought this because I needed to replace my corded vacuum Dirt Devil after many years. This is a heavy, awkward Dirt Devil which blows so much hot air out of the side that it just blows the dirt around and picks up nothing. Everything is awkwardly located and it's very difficult to remove the power nozzle from the base. I'm writing this off as a $40 loss and looking for another brand. The heat is so intense that I fear a fire using this Dirt Devil and I have only used it three times in two weeks."
2,underwhelming performance,"I have had this hand vac for less than 6 months and the beater brush has stopped working. As with many bagless vacs, it looses suction quickly and emptying the canister is a dusty messy process. My favorite thing is when you pop-off the canister to take it out to empty and the lid flies off, spilling out all the dust that you just vacuumed up.I wish I hadn't bought this vacuum. It worked ok in the first month but went downhill quickly after that."
1,Poor Performer,"If you want a hand vacuum with brush capability (vs. just suction), this is a BAD choice. The brushes on this unit are driven by vacuum or suction power and the brushes turn for, oh about 2 seconds, once you put the unit on any kind of fabric. Completely useless. Good luck!"
3,Does the job,"Bought this model since it was offered with free shipping and I've previously owned Dirt Devil hand-vacs, which all lasted a long time before they died valiant deaths. I use it for hard to reach places with the nozzle or the hose and it works fine as long as it doesn't run for a long time -- then it gets a little too hot to handle. If you need it for small, tight jobs, this is a good buy. I miss the bags, though. Understand that the bagged models are going out of commission, which is sad. Emptying the cup can be messy, but the cup is very large on this model. One thing: the filter may be tricky to find when it's time to replace it. Dirt Devil's website shows it's out of stock (temporarily). Wish I knew that before I bought this model....."
2,Original is better,"After having the Original Dirt Devil Hand Vac for over 10 years it finally gave out. I purchased the Power Reach and it has good power but we need the extension of the flexible hose and extension wands! The Power Reach has no accessories! And the old extension tools don't fit. I wouldn't call it ""reach"" at all! If you need to get up high I wouldn't purchase this one. I am returning it and getting the original."
1,Poorest Dirt Devil I have ever purchased,"The Dirt Devil M08245 Power Reach sounded just great in the advertisements, but has turned out to be a major disappointment. While the product is easy to clean of dust and debris, the roller assembly if worthless. The brush stops in contact with any surface and does not perform at all. Even very light pressure from your fingers will stop the revolving brush. You are simply left with a suction hand vac without the benefit of a brush. I am sorry I bought this product."
1,Complete waste of money.,"The rotating brush is not directly powered by a belt, rather it spins via the air flowing by it from the vaccum. It therefore has hardly any torque and will stop spinning very quickly not clean anything. I can't believe Dirt Devil even bothered releasing this on the market. It's getting returned."
4,Powerful hand vacuum,"This is exactly what I was looking for: light enough to carry around rooms, small enough to store in kitchen/dining room cabinet, powerful enough to clean pet fur, meal crumbs.The only thing I am having trouble with is taking apart the nozzle to attach a different attachment. So far I've always had to ask my husband to do it."
1,This vacuum sucks literally,I am very disappointed in the vacuum. 10 years ago I have the older model of the hand held dirt devil so I assumed this would work the same.....Well it doesn't! I bought it to do my stairs but the suction is awful. It doesn't pick up fuzz or kitty litter from my carpet. I am very disappointed!
5,The Dirt Devil is perfect for stairs...,"The Dirt Devil is great, because it can be used in two different ways. First, it can be used as a bagless hand vacuum making it easier to clean dirt in hard-to-reach places. And, it can be used as a mini-canister vacuum by sliding the power head off to clean stairs, upholstery, or my car.For tight spaces, the Dirt Devil has a hose and crevice tool.It has a clear dirt container that is easy to empty. The 20-foot power cord is a nice feature.My i-Robot Roomba handles the rest of the house, so vacuuming is not a chore anymore!"
1,I hate it!,"Don't buy this vacuum. It is awful. I owned the old dirt devil and when it broke after 10 years, I bought this. It didn't vacuum well from day 1 and it continued to get worse. I just got the dirt devil ultra and it seems to vacuum well."
4,Dirt Devil Review,The vacuum has adequate suction to clean. The rotating brush isuseless. It's own weight on the carpet will stop the rotation.
1,rotating brush bar is a joke,"Do NOT buy this product! (Dirt Devil Power Reach Hand Vac)I bought this product at the thrift store, and it looked like it was new, except for a brush roller that didn't spin. No problem, simply replace the belt, right? Wrong.I can see why someone got rid of it. I took the unit apart, and the belt is fine. This product's brush roller mechanism has a non-functional, pathetically inadequate design. There is nothing but air to make the brush roller spin. And that airflow isn't nearly powerful enough, even when the brush isn't touching anything. Dirt Devil needs to stop selling this product, and go back to the drawing board."
2,Kinda good.,The vacuum has very strong suction but the turbobrush does not perform very well. It stops turning every time even the slightest bit of pressure on it. o
1,"Absolutely awful. I never would have bought this for myself but my mother, who's never vacuumed anything in her life did.",The ONLY thing redeeming about this machine is the suction. It's close to impossible to use and the loud whine is very uncomfortable. I hate it with all my heart.
1,Week Vacuum,"I bought a so call ""Dirt Devil"" vacuum N the suction is so weak it only pick up dust nothing heavier... I am totally disappointed with this merchandise /( /( /("
2,When Money Grew on Trees,I also knew this Sheriff but not in the same way David Mac knew him. It was written very poorly.
4,awesome,"so happy to find this book! bought it for my dad who grew up in springdale, he's having fun reading about ralph baker. book was in perfect condition, thanks!"
1,Miserable print quality,"The Hebrew letters are very small, fuzzy, smudgy, and painful to read. The difference between a gimel and a nun can be impossible to see, chaf and bet confused, even heh and hhet are hard to pick apart. I need a huge magnifier and a good deal of luck to get a result. It's a shame because the dictionary contains a large number of words. Keep looking and skip this one. It will become plant food at my house once I find a replacement."
2,"Leaks, Freezes Hard, Does Not Heat Easily","I bought four of these to add to a cooler to keep beverages cold without wasting ice or the mess of melting things.It does that alright, however, every single one of them have begun to leak a very chemical smelling, off yellow liquid.I contained this problem with the quart sized freezer ziplock bags.Also, to heat up you have to fully cover in water, and the product doesn't get very hot. (I have only heated one, and that one leaks worse than the others.)Considering the price, I suppose the deal wasn't so bad, as I am able to use them for my intended purpose."
4,One of the better books to come out of the Great War,"Wry humor mixed with sadness and horror of World War I by the author of I, Claudius. I really enjoyed the man's wit and ability to convey a feel for the actual times. The very best book to come from the UK with a worm's eye view of the Great War."
4,A little Wizardry,"This video is a taping of one of Schwager's seminar presentations. In it he focuses on the importance of developing a trading methodology which reflects your personality. He shares numerous stories along the way and is very entertaining. As one would expect, the whole thing is right out of his Market Wizards books, so anyone who's read them numerous times (as I have) could be left feeling a little unsatisfied. If, however, you haven't read Market Wizards or its follow-up, The New Market Wizards, this video is an excellent starting point."
1,the interviews,"I don't usually write reviews, but felt I needed to bring the rating down on this one to save people some money, great music, but as said in other reviews, the interviews kill it. Stay away."
2,Great Collection... Bad production,"Great collection of songs, but about 75% of them have little 5-15 second interview clips on the end of them. These clips are part of the tracks themselves so you can't just skip over them or program your player to ignore them. They aren't bad bits, but I don't want to hear the same comments on the end of the same song every time.I went in with an audio editor and edited a lot of the clips out, but some actually overlap the music itself, so people start talking even before the song has completely faded out. No good way to edit those. It took me about an hour and a half to clean this CD up enough to really enjoy the music. If I had listened to it first and heard these bits, I would not have purchased this collection."
4,Perfect,This is a high quality shower curtain. We searched every store in the area and found nothing with southwestern styling. This fits the bill and is simply perfect.
1,pkkirk123,Purchased this today and applied to my wax buildup dining room table. The spots from the buildup still remain after rubbing profusely with this product. Didn't do anything to my table. Save yourself the $$'s there are home-made concoctions that can be made that could possibly work the same if not better.........
2,not what I expected,"If you're not very creative, then get this book. I bought this hoping to get some fresh ideas of things to do with my baby to make events memorable. That plus I'm a fan of Dr. Dobson and would trust in his recommendations.But there weren't a whole lot of ideas that I haven't already heard about from friends. I think that most people could find similar/comparable ideas on the internet, Sunday School, or by asking an Elementary School teacher (GREAT resource if you happen to know any).But if you want a reference for some quick and easy ideas, then this book is fine. The thing that I like best is that it's colorful and my baby loves to look at the pictures and turn the pages."
5,Deeply moving story,"I was deeply moved by this well constructed story. It is tragic, the character struggle and in spite of the misery they are in they try to keep on living their own lives and not simply existing. The heroine loves deeply and never deviates from her love, doing whatever it takes to get him what he needs even when he is giving up.I got so involved I actually forgot I was reading subtitles and began to feel as if the dialog was in English! A top flight movie!"
4,"Russians speaking Italian, with English subtitles","Hollywood has never done Rand justice. Gary Cooper was a wooden Howard Roark in King Vidor's ""The Fountainhead"", and Rand's own adapted screenplay left viewers scratching their heads about her ""message"". The recent ""Passion of Ayn Rand"" is just a cheap ad hominum attack. This film breathes life into her work. The actors are physically perfect, passionate instead of talky. Alida Valli is gorgeous in the lead role. The smokey black and white is perfect for 1917 Russia, and the production quality rivals Hollywood's best for that era. It's hard to believe this film was essentially a bootleg, made witout the authorization or cooperation of the book's author. When Rand saw the ""discovered"" print in the early 1980's, she loved it."
2,foolish film after all,"I expected a ""masterpiece"" after the glowing reviews, but it is not.The actors are past matinee idols and not capable of expressing deeper thoughts, the movie basically drags on and on. Except for a few scenes depicting the Revolution, this is a film about a love story that has no ""fire"".Ayn Rand stories don't translate well on film, she is probably better on the written page."
1,A steal at only $150!!,"Let me clearly state that I did not watch this movie, the 1 star rating is based solely on the rental fee. I will never watch any movie that costs $150 to rent. That is a ridiculous price."
4,No way to live.,"Don't be discouraged if you buy this movie and at first see poor quality video. It does clear up, and just remember we are lucky to have it at all. Second; I would recommend reading the book before viewing to make reading the subtitles easier. Sometimes the words are quite hard to see.The only disappointment came when the movie finished without the ending from the novel. If the original film was lost then it is forgivable. If not, I don't understand the deletion.Beware! The film is intended to be a true depiction of life in a slave state where no one can be trusted. Ayn Rand saw it and lived it herself. She knew the importance of sharing the experience with those who never lived with these conditions. The right to choose one's own destiny led her to depart Russia and come here."
5,Riveting and relevant,"Not only is the plot a classic for modern civilizatin, but the story behind the making and preservation of this film is worth knowing as well. A young Alida Valli gives a good performance."
5,Movie,Everyone should see this movie. Especially now with all that is going on with the fiscal cliff.That's all nothing more to say.
3,Body brokers,"A very interesting and well written account of the under belly of a world not known to most people. The choice to donate one's body to further education and research in health care is a noble one. This book exposes so of the less than honest practices that affect the public as well as those who no longer can defend themselves,the donated human cadaver. This well written take on and exposes the unscrupulous practices that can turn a noble intended wish to donated into a dangerous scheme for profit by the unscrupulous body brokers"
4,Warning: This is not a cookbook!!!,"I bought this book after I got an email from Amazon recommending this to people who bought ""The Silver Spoon"" (the Italian equivalent of ""The Joy of Cooking""), a cookbook that I bought my mother for Christmas. I was shocked to find out that this isn't about food at all, but rather the illegal trafficking of human remains. Yuck! I sure am glad it doesn't have any recipes!That said, I'm sure it's quite a good read for fans of the genre."
3,Creepy but Enlightening ...,Cheney's expose is long on critique and short on solutions. A disturbing (but somewhat over-long)disclosure of practices that seem sordid. Don't the dead deserve better treatment than what she depicts? What are the solutions? Don't expect themhere.
1,Poorly Written and Misleading,This book is nothing more than the extension of a magazine article and the author's process of going through the research in writing it. She provides little substance to allow outsiders to fully understand the myriad issues involved in the use of human remains and instead chooses to sensationalize poorly researched facts. By doing so she does a disservice to the thousands of hard working people who are trying to pass on the gift of life to help others - whether through cadaveric training or tissue donation. There are much better books out there for people who are truly interested in learning about this industry. See M. Goodwin's book for instance.
3,"Enlightening, YES. Bookworthy, NO.","""When you donate your body, you've given up the right to choose how it will be used"" and ""Leaving your loved ones with a funeral home may expose them to unscrupulous body parts dealers"". That basically sums up the book.The first 1/3 of the book is an interesting (and disturbing) foray into the US body parts trade and the legal and illegal aspects of it. Unfortunately, the rest of the book doesn't build upon the first part and is simply backstory for how the investigations were done. Interesting, but not particularly exciting.This would be much more suited to an article, rather than a book.Verdict: Borrow it from the library (Remember what that is?)"
1,disappointing book,"I ordered this book for a recently diagnosed friend in the UK, and frankly I've already imparted to her more information in the research I did myself from the internet. This leaflet is definitely not worth $12.50"
2,Promise unfulfilled,"As a sufferer of SCA I looked forward to receiving this book as there is limited published information available especially in smaller countries. It contains some basic information on coping with balance and related problems, but nothing that a General Practitioner wouldn't impart in the first 10 minutes following diagnosis and /or one's own common sense would guide. There are some useful internet addresses but anyone who orders this book through the internet has probably already discovered those [and more] using a search engine. It costs a great deal for shipping to other parts of the world and the full cost [especially to people in countries which don't have social security or government support] is significant. The description of ""Paperback"" is a gross mis-statement - this is at best a ""pamphlet"" or ""booklet"" I was left hugely disappointed and angry."
4,Quick update on the marketing world,"Advertising Age gives you a birds-eye view of what's happening in the world of advertising and marketing. A good amount of news, trends, and other information is packed into dozens of small blurbs, sidebars, and page-long articles. While I enjoy the content, I have two complaints. The physical format is in-between a newspaper and magazine meaning it is printed on glossy paper and staple bound on the left edge, but it is large and floppy. The other annoying feature is the number of articles that start on the first few pages but are continued somewhere in the back."
2,not the best,"to me .this book was definately NOT one of the best in the series.I admire the Kristina,but this book was slow and dull.It was practiacally all about the politics of sweden.very dull."
1,This book was NOT good!,"In this book Kristina's parents have been trying for years to have a son, and what do they get? A girl. I mean, her mom actually cries when Kristina is born, and Kristina was raised like a boy!?I mean what's up with that? No one should by this book, and I mean no one. It's a disgrace to the Royal Diaries series."
5,"not everyone wants to be a ""queen""","But they might want to be a king. Kirstina: The Girl King is a fabulous addition to the Royal Diaries series. Before reading, I hadn't ever heard of her, but after reading about her in this book, I truly admire her rebelious manner about not marrying and avoiding other things women were meant to learn those days. She is not your average queen type, she is more of a ... king."
4,"Bye, Bye Baby !","Good song and one of my favourites from the Erotica album.The cd single has a couple of good remixes on it.They are:1 Madonna's night on the club2 House mix.But, to be quite honest, the tracks all seem to sound very similar.Good buy though for the above 2 tracks, and Madonna fans will certainly enjoy."
2,"This is essentially the same book as ""Garden Style""","I actually liked this book so much I ordered ""Garden Style"" by the same authors, only to discover almost the exact same book. I kid you not, I counted at least 12 projects/photos that are EXACTLY THE SAME in both books. Since the books are only 130 pages long to begin with, I felt cheated. When I buy 2 different titles, I expect 2 different books. My advice: buy one or the other, not both."
1,Should have passed,"While the book is full of nice pictures, the actual useful projects are rather scant to my liking. I did have one item project that I am interested in pursuing, but overall, the overcrowded pictures take away from the item for the project. The instructions are a bit wanting, leaving gaps in the process, ex. the making of the teacup-based lamp where the actually steps and pictures for the fitting of the hardware is abscent."
2,Not worth buying,"Now when looking at this book, do not be fooled by the cover!!! I sure was. This book is suppose to be the art of drawing manga, but to tell you the truth, this book looks more like crappy manga characters. This illustrations on how to draw the heads are very mis-shapen and poorly drawn. Do not buy this book! It is not very helpful to beginners, the only thing that is helpful in this book would be the eyes, mouth, and hands. If you need a book to show you how to draw correctly, I would recommend ""Manga techniques character design for beginners vol 1 &4, and more how to draw manga vol 1 the basics of character drawing. I highly recommend those three books. They can help you with character expressions, eyes, and examples of hair styles. The books that I recommended does not have any nudity at all, so it is perfect for those who are offended by nudity. So all in all, do not buy the art of drawing manga!! It is a waste of money!!"
5,$19 Dollars Is So Worth It For The MULTIPLAYER MODEl!!! BUY IT NOW!!!!,"I actually got this game a year ago, and beat the story mode in a week. I didn't really try out the online mode until recently. The story mode is about 15 hours long with about 5~8 hours of gameplay and 7 hours of movie. I didn't feel I was getting enough actions at first and was a bit disappointed compared to how awesome MGS 1 and MGS3 were.Then, boom, I just started playing the Metal Gear Online, and it has been so amazing. THIS GAME'S MULTIPLAYER MODE IS SO GOOD AND THERE ARE SO MUCH ACTIONS AND GAMEPLAY!!! It's hard to get used to it at first on the multiplayer, but after around 3 rounds, you will get the hang of it! It's a must buy!!!!"
5,"Now a ""Greatest Hits"" title",As of today this is now a Greatest Hits title and can be bought anywhere for $29.99
3,"What a nice ""movie""?!?!","Watching this ""movie"" was cool at beginning, but it gets tiresome after a while. I kind of remember some ""game playing"", I mean it... 80% of this game is movie cuts... though it may capture your attention at the beginning it will eventually make you feel tired! Playing previous Metal Gear games is mandatory if you want to ""play"" this one, otherwise even the movie cuts will be meaningless and a complete mess! You`ll finish this ""game"" and you will barely remember having touched the gamepad...!Graphically speaking, it's just simply the best EVER! No point of discussion about it!Soundtrack is outstanding as well...!"
2,Not for the average Gamer,"I consider myself an average gamer. I have played an MGS game before and I did enjoy it. But this one I played for about 30 minutes and really couldnt get into it. It seemed cheesy to me. Yeah the graphics are outstanding, sound good as far as I can tell. The story at the beginning seemed a little corn ball. I dont know this game just couldnt get my atttention so to speak. I know there are some people who cream all over this stuff, but like I said its not for me"
1,MGS4 Huge Let Down,"The game had great graphics, but the storyline and game play were awful. The storyline didn't grab me at all and I literally fell asleep on one of the cut scenes that's how boring the storyline was. I'm very disappointed by this game considering the fact that I'm a huge MGS fan."
1,Not a fan.,"Phenomenal graphics. But the creators are so in love with themselves and showing their art, that there is barely any gameplay. If you're a fan of the franchise, and love the story line, you'll love this game. If you are like me, and couldn't care less for story, you'll be bored real quick."
2,Game makers gave up,"1. Game makers abandoned the Online, after jumping through 3 places to register to play the game still is/was unable to play online. Now the system is offline for all users.2. Controls are terrible, nothing like the original games.3. level design is poor.4. cameras are not for our advantage.by far the worse game in the series. Looking forward to the next game which was sold by a competitive game maker."
1,A Mediocre war movie not a game,if you wana watch a less than fine war movie then get this game or even rent a movie but if you think you can play you are totally mistaken coz when i say this a game i do play my part in that game so watch it
2,Snake moves slow...,"To be honest, this is my first time buying and really playing a Metal Gear Solid game because I'm not much into the sneak around and be quiet games. After doing plenty of research, and even pestering the worker at the game store, I decided to buy MGS 4 because everything said you can run-and-gun. Not so much... I mean, if you consider slowly jogging and trying to not get shot (because about 6-8 bullets kill you) run-and-gun, then by all means, I guess it's a run-and-gun game. I was hoping it would be more along the lines of Halo or even BioShock, but Snake just moves way too slow. The graphics are great and the story line seems like it could be engrossing, so if you don't mind your soldier moving at a snail's pace, give this game a shot. If you like to really run-and-gun (and I mean run!!), then skip this game because you'll probably get aggravated during the first act."
5,Worth all the hype!,"First off I've never played a Metal Gear game before this one, so I'm not a long time fan. The only reason I got the game was because of all the hype surrounding it. Well this game lives up to the hype and more, I wish I could give it more stars. This is what the PS3 has been waiting for!"
5,It's amazing to see and nearly feel this game,"I am a huge fan of the Metal Gear Solid series and conclusions can be made.... I, for once, have to admit a f@(//$%&ing thing: Kojima-san is a genius!! A game which can truly keep you entertained, can give you value for the price and gives you compelling, intuitive story in a action/adventure narrative..... well is just what people are looking for (is what I feel and like about the MGS series) as well as REALLY rich graphics for a next gen game in an awesome console such as the PS3 (every model!)... don't get me wrong, I have tried all of the consoles from this gen and had fun with the Wii (Wii sports is hilarious) and played halo in (both) Xbox, but it is the PS3 with this game that wins me and thats why I bought it plus some of the excellent games I have seen, caught my eyes and are now part of my collection!"
5,One of the best!,"This game is no question one of the best that I have ever played. I was somewhat skeptical (since all of the previous MGS's were also good), but this one is the best so far. Beautiful game as well. Man, what an awesome job they did with this being their first on the PS3!! Revised control scheme is a God send as well!"
5,***** EPIC HAS A NEW STANDARD!!!*****,I am not able to put into words the sheer perfection that is this game. I have played this game completely through about 7 times and I am sure each time that I will never play a game this epic for many years to come! The story is one that you must experience uninterrupted to fully enjoy the passion that the team has obviously poured all over this piece of art. I have never sat back in my seat at the end of a game and actually feel like I have finally finished a truly epic adventure just as I wish there was more but fully understand that it was suppose to end this way.....and what a ending it is.There are plenty of very good in depth reviews here. I just feel the need to expresses my gratitude and try to tell others that this is a story to behold.BUY THIS GAME15/10 FIVE STARS*****
5,Hardcore game! This is a certified (A-List game)!,"Graphics are top notch stunning! A-List game across the board. Great storyline and balls-to wall action. Great CG effects. (A-list) roaming ability. Great shooter action and HUD usage. Great response and control of your character. This is a great game of stealth and balls! Some of the missions in this game are very hard. You WILL put in work to beat this game, trust me. Overall, this is a classic and well put together game that should be an industry standard. I highly recommend this game to all. Thanks guys."
4,Thumbs up,I love this game and I could't even finished it.. Great storyboard..I'm going to end this game sometime soon because another version is already out..
3,Way too many cutscenes,"Theres alot in this game if your not a fan of the series prepare to feel lost and overall annoyed in how many cutscenes there are just to get the point accross. This game needed more gameplay story narrative then more cutscene narrative. As it is the game is now known as a movie with short burst of gameplay. But the story overall is a fine one and the preduction value is high overall.Multiplayer wise the game is aimed at a more hardcore audience if your casuel online gamer you'll have a hard time making sense to all the clans,box tricks,tournaments etc. But if you do stick with it and have a bunch of friends its a blast to play."
3,Kojima Faulters in his Final Metal Gear,"I've followed the Metal Gear series since MGS1 was released on the PS1. I loved the first, but MGS2 was a bit of a downer. Then MGS3 came out, and it was AMAZING. I had such high hopes for MGS4, but it was ultimately a disappointment. Amazing HD graphics, extremely detailed. Gameplay mechanics are a bit complicated, but you get used to them, and it can be really fun. However the story line feels a little forced. EPILOGUE WAS HORRIBLE! Almost embarrassing. I would say its worth buying, especially if you're a fan. If not, parts 1 and 3 are must haves."
5,Leonard007xxx,The most amazing online game!!! this is the best game im level 9 and this is the best game ever.. if u never played MGS u never play
3,Unassumption,"Farfetched and conspiritorial as ever, not much different from the previous games but if you like that sort of thing especially the over the top action and postmodern BS you'll like it. Wish they hadn't burned so much cash on graphics."
3,Longest Movie Ever,"The game is basically 70% movie, 30% game. There are times where you watch film for 30-35 minutes between playing the game. Its fun playing but just way to much film."
2,"Ignore the 5 star reviews, if you are sane person","This is not a game. This is a torture on a disk. I paid $9 for this game, used. I could have a nice lunch instead.First time you put the disk in, make sure to have much time, as there is about 25 minutes worth of installation and cutscenes that are boring, over the top and plain silly. After that, you will spend couple of hours learning the ridiculous control system, that is, if you have enough patience. But you will not play, no. You will watch further cutscenes.This is a well produced game, directed by insane person made for insane people that enjoy mental torture and have way too much free time. These people will play this game until their fingers bleed just so they can tell us with their 5 star ratings how much we just dont get it."
4,Best in the Series - Long Cutscenes Though,"This game has been amazing. I loved the original Metal Gear Solid on the Playstation and have fond memories of that game. However, this game far exceeded my expectations. The only complaint I have is the amount of cut scenes that can take away from the experience of actually playing the game. You might play for 15-30 minutes (depending on how slow you move) and then you have a 15-20 minute cut scene. Other than that the game is amazing and definitely worth the purchase of $20-30 today."
5,So Far So Good,"Came home with the game hours ago and I'm currently in the second Act. I know it's considered early to post a review this early into the game, but wow is it great. The camo integration is so seamless, and it adds a new gameplay mechanic into the strategy.I've been a big MGS fan since MGS2: Sons of Liberty, so I may be biased in favor of it, but I can certainly say I love this game."
5,#4 is The charm,"Hello, this game is wonderful, i have played all of the ""METAL GEAR"" games and the fourth installment is the charm. I love this game it has heart pounding action, 1080P resolution and as always (a boat load of) items and weapons to help you, get rid of the terrible villian, i won`t go any further into details, because i don`t want to give away the amazing story, but i give you my word, if you like this type of game, you won`t be let down. It even has an easy mode, for those who are not good being stealthy. It can be hard at times, but if i can do it (i am not very bright) than so can you. I would totally recommand this great game, i feel it is the best in the series, i truly do. GO GET IT!!!!!!!Thanks"
4,"Great Game, Cut Scenes and Story Suck","This is a great game and fun to play. My only disappointment are the cinematics and overall story. Just my personal opinion, but I wish game developers would reallocate all of the ""wasted"" resources spent developing these pseudo movies to just simply make the games bigger. I play games for the challenge, not the story, I want more levels, weapons, etc., and fewer weird Japanese cut scenes."
3,not my cup of tea,"Metal Gear Solid 4 is impressive in many ways but it lost my interest mainly because it's just not my type of game. I don't have the patience for a stealth game and found myself getting bored and the horrible saving system didn't help matters. You can't save your progress and the checkpoints are few and far between. You'll spend 45 minutes painstakingly going through a section trying to find all the items and evade notice only to get killed and lose everything. I ended up playing the game on easy and turning it into a run and gun shooter, which is not the way it's supposed to be played. Of course it has amazing graphics but that's to be expected. It also has great weapons and gear selection, neat gadgets, excellent customization, and great humor but none of this was enough to compensate for the flaws. My one last criticism is that the cut scenes are WAY too long. Fortunately, I got this game in a trade so I only paid the $5 shipping."
3,Could not be cheesier!,"I have never written a review before. However, I just had to with this game. The game play was typical MGS. No problems there.But the story and cut scenes were UNBEARABLE!!! I mean there was a wedding! Are you kidding me?!!! The plot and story were definitely written by geeky software engineers. Have any of them ever been with a women before? I'm also blown away with the sexism in it. Every girl needed to be saved by a man and they were always crying. (I'm male by the way.)If this was a movie, it would be straight to DVD. Not even Blu-ray! To some degree I had fun playing it, so I gave it 3 stars. I ended up just skipping most of the cut scenes half way through the game. It was just soooo cheesey. I mean I am blown away that the story and plot were released for the public to see. Its as if a child wrote the story line. Its embarrassing! I know I said this before but... THERE IS A WEDDING in this video game. WHAT!!!??? I am I alone here?"
2,A game Idea Gone HORRIBLY Wrong,"Bought this game based on the 5 star reviews and and somehow praise in the press and am mystified as to what all the fuss is about.I find snake as a character almost unbearingly annoying to have.I mean you almost want him to just go away.The cutscenes are dreadfull and god looooong and the controls are just weird.Switching weapons on the main menu lol.Either its a movie or its a video game,it does neither very well at all.In that sense the game is a disaster.Devoted about 3 hours to this game and was pressing on in disbief at just how bored,unimpressed and at times horrible the game was.Vide games are supposed to be fun,,,this isnt.Resistance the fal of man has a story that blows this one away too and that is short brief and to the point..Is snake so interesting??? Now I am stuck with this game to gather dust or sell for a few dollars at best."
2,The controls on this game make it very confusing.,"I expected more than this from Metal Gear. The controls are not very user friendly. When it tough playing the game, and the game isn't that tough, that's when you know its a sucky game."
3,A movie with some game-play,"If you like animated movies then this is for you. This shouldn't really be considered a game in the traditional sense. There are cool elements to the gameplay when you get to experience it. It involves a whole lot of creeping around. The creators have been steadily watering down this series giving you the ability to proceed through the game by killing any and all people you come into contact with...without getting killed in the proceeding 3 seconds, something I don't really remember in previous Metal Gear games. The game is much more challenging if you try to proceed without killing anyone and without being detected, which is how you're probably supposed to play it. It's definitely worth playing but it's not my favorite game."
3,Not for casual gamers!,"I mainly play PC games, but bought this to highlight my PS3 purchased primarily for Blu-Ray movies. I found the controls confusing and complicated. This is the first Metal Gear game and found myself a bit lost with the plot. The game technique just didn't appeal to me, I guess I am just simple minded but much prefer running around shooting things than sneaking around for hours on end. In the end it was a frustrating, long experience that I gave up in Act 2."
3,Simply not my type of game...,"I have to state up-front that I only got MGS4 as a part of the 80Gb PS3 bundle. I bought the PS3 as a Blu-Ray player and not as a gaming platform. I've spent almost 15 years playing PC games and have had a 360 for the last two years.As for the game itself, although visually stunning, the game-play and the incredibly long cut-scenes were just not for me. I lasted about 5 hours with it and then took it down to the store and traded it for a new copy of Resistance: The Fall of Man. Shooting creatures and blowing things up...My kind'a game!I have to add that I think the PS3 is a fine gaming platform and I have already pre-ordered Resistance 2...so it will be doing more than playing BD movies."
1,Worst control setup ever,I've been gaming for years since i could use my thumbs and from jrpg's to bioware's masterpeices but this game's control set up is the worst i've ever seen and most likely will just a heads up for anyone who wants to buy this be careful and read the instruction manual!!! (not that it's very discripttive)
2,Disappointed as a MGS fans,"As a Big MGS Fan, a little disappointed with this one. The player view is a little hard to see your surrounding(Almost impossible to see who is coming) and view is NOT adjustable. This make me almost impossible to control. The story is attractive, but how the hell you expect me to remember something almost 10 year ago from MGS1. How the hell Snake have a big butt like this. It is just way off scale. Game speed is very slow. When the alert mode is on, snake move with speed of a turtle. Running & walking look the same speed to me. Anyway, still get it credit with good graphic & variety of weapon choice. I missed my MGS 3..."
1,Eh......,"I got this game when it first came out, I played it for two weeks. Now this is my personal opinion of the game, it was very hard for me to get into MGS4, nothing interested me about the game. I just didn't like it."
1,Simply Not A Game by all conventionality. Beware,"well, i have been a big metal gear fan playing all of them that are canon. I was at least expecting new game enviroments to explore... what i played was utterly ridiculous... a very brief point a to b mini game sometimes with a boss sometimes not with hours of cgi movies loaded with so many technobabbles you will lose interest in finishing the rest of it. The irresponsible story telling of previous games has led to a very uninteresting conclusion... There really should be a DISCLAIMER on the box calling it what it really is... a blu ray movie. All in all i would say there is 2 and a half hours gameplay to the 12 hours of cutscenes... but I can honestly say I am not a fan anymore and care not to pick up the next metal gear. this is easily the worst in the series yet because there is no game here to play."
5,Absolutely the best game I have ever played!,"Absolutely the best game I have ever played! that being said I have been a fan of Metal Gear Solid since the PS1 release. Yes at times the videos do drag on little, but if you are a Metal Gear fan you will enjoy! I have approximately 20 ps3 games and this is the only one that I wish to play over and over again! Now if you don't like games with long cinematic s, metal gear solid games, stealth games or are only a fan FPS fan YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME! But if you are like me this will be the best game you have ever played!"
3,If you like to sit through long loading screens . . .,"then this game is for you. If you like to sit through endless cutscenes and non-existent gameplay, then this game is for you. It does look really nice though, but it's overrated. I finished the ""game"" to gape at the visuals and then promptly traded it in. It's worth a rental."
3,Good,"Very good quality Game, its the best game ever?. I am very pleased to have made &#8203;&#8203;this purchase, good price and value relationship"
5,"PS3 Shows Off Its Capabilities, MGS 4 A 'Solid' Game","Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily as technically amazing as it is fun and compelling. After the long wait PS3 has a booming and obviously successful title highly worth mentioning.Many argue that the story is utter garbage, opinions applied here I must sayI have no problem with it. The overall story in my opinion is great and highly cinematic, the graphics easily attribute to the Hollywood flick like feeling. The controls are smooth, but may take a bit to some to get use to.A must buy for PS3 owners, fans of stealthy (or in my case dramatic gun run approach), or fans of a great story. MGS 4 will not let you down."
5,Amazing,"This game is nearly a work of art. I wouldn't advise someone to just buy a ps3 for it, but I'd certainly advise people to make friends with someone who owns one and play through it.It's not very playable if you aren't already a big fan of the series and the constant cutscenes get a little tiring. You CAN pause them in this game though, which is nice. It's just frustrating to have a ten minute movie every five minutes of walking.Either way, the story line is epic, fantastic, and it's a stunning 'conclusion' to the MGS series."
2,Cannot Echo the High Praise,"I am mystified by the number of really mediocre games that get high ratings on Amazon. This is another one of them. Because the price was only $20 I thought I'd take a chance, but once again, the high-raters put one over on me. If you have played ""good"" shooters then you know what I mean and you should save your money. The gameplay is cumbersome and the cut-scene movies numerous."
3,Fun the First Time Thru,"This game is great to play, great graphics etc.... but it is a one time play, once u beat it it is unlikely that u will play it again, there is no option to play just one level, u have to play thru the whole game again, and there is no multiplayer game. This might be a game worth renting over a rainy weekend. The only major complaint I have is that the last 1/4 of the game takes like 2 hours to beat, but u r only playing the game for about 20 minutes, the rest is movies, and just hitting the same button over and over again for 20 minutes, HUGE let down."
4,IT GOOD,"PROS: the playablity is good, story is great and long its five acts that seem to never end. the graphics are good for its timeCONS: no trophies."
5,Simply Amazing,"The game was amazing! Incredible graphics and detail to every little thing. Wraps up the story in every sense possible. Straightens out all the twists and turns of the series. If you've ever played MGS before you need this one! I've been a huge fan, played them all. And this is not one to be left out of the collection. Typical MGS style with cutscenes, but if you're a true fan you will appreciate them. Especially with the flashback scenes to previous games. Even if youre not a huge fan, the long cutscenes will give you the entire story line. Sad to see the story end, but this is one incredible way to do it! Top 3 best games of all time!"
3,"Fun, but a lot of cutscenes",I'm more of a fan of the old school Metal Gear where you just play rather than having to sit through a 10-minute cut scene. That being said - the game is really fun. Just wish it kept moving.
3,Not for me...,"While I can see why some love this game..the graffics, story etc. it just wasn't for me and I was pretty disapointed 3 hrs in. I like slight eliments of steath but I perfer more action in my games. The cut scene's didn't bother me cause I read before I bought it that they have a heavy dose but what I hated the most was the controls and aiming overall for shooting, I just think for a game that got a 10 accross the board those things wouldn't be such an issue. Like I said just wasn't for me and if you like alot of action in your games you might feel the same way."
2,Not like the others at all,"It's definitely a cinematic game, but that's its biggest downfall. It's impossible to simply pick-up-and-play this game; be ready to dedicate at least an hour to this game if you hope to play for twenty minutes.For those looking for a game, and not a movie, buy a game, instead of Metal Gear Solid 4. It's that easy!"
2,good graphics,First the cut scenes are way too long and frequent. Second is the installation is fragile. I have had to reinstall 3 times first resetting my ps3 to defaults or game would freeze. The control system is terrible. Way too complicated. I don't like sneak games. This one seems to be all stealth and no shoot. At least that is what the game tells you. I gave up after a half hour due to about 28 minutes of the half hour being cut scenes.
3,It's no COD4 but still a very Solid game.,"Bought MGS4 after rave reviews by critics and fans alike. The previews are insane and graphically and story-wise the game does not disappoint. I think this is a classic Metal Gear game though where stealth and strategy as gameplay interwoven with phenomenal cut scenes.Although the critics have said the gameplay can be equivalent to a third person shooter much like a COD is. I don't agree that the gameplay is nearly as seamless and fun. The vast amounts of items and weapons typically seen in Metal Gear games is there but the targeting, gunplay, etc. isn't done as well.Overall a solid game but really will be enjoyed by true Metal Gear fans."
2,Worst.Online.Game.Ever,"Seriously. I loved MGS 1-3. Story mode in MGS4 is not horrible. However, I really expected more from Metal Gear Online. Graphics are amazing, but gameplay is sluggish and extremely difficult to master. Absolutely hate it. Granted, this is a ""stealth"" game, but online play is pure combat simulator, and should be much more responsive. Do yourself a favor and play Call of Duty 4 instead."
2,Disappointed,"Graphics are weak. Gameplay is anciently stiff. Story is lame, unless you like dumb characters made up to try and support lame gameplay.That's how I feel about this game after getting and playing Batman, Assasin's Creed and Unchartered 2."
2,Story mode is great but MGO its terrible!,"Since Im more into multiplayer than story mode, I was expecting metal gear online to be great.. but is the most terrible mutiplayer shooter game i had every play!.. its just terrible.. its to complex, they cant make it simple as COD4 or others... you need to shoot the guy like 30 to kill..etc, etc.. its just terrible game.."
1,TL;DW,"This game is one of the worst ever! For one, you play as an old man and you have to sneak around enemies and stuff, which is boring and lame. And the storyline is completely lame, as the cutscenes are way TL;DW. Don't buy this godawful excuse for a game.Now if you want a good sneaking game, play Sneak King."
1,This game sucks...,"Hello Folks,I am shocked to see the high scores.This game truly sucks. Lousy single player, and even lousier multiplayer.Linear game flow, silly and boring story, loose controls, and very boring play make this game a one star. I am glad I sold it and the game guide. Oh, and no co-op either.The MP was boring, slow-moving, not inspiring...not fun.If you want fun MP action, with destructable environment, fantastic sound dynamics/realism, and the best looking visuals in a game, head over to Battlefield Bad Company. That has no co-op in SP either, but the MP is great fun.John"
1,WORST GAME I'VE EVER HAD.,"Someone else has written an in depth one star review, worth reading for sure, but save yourself the trouble.Video games are 1st and foremost about control, and "" feeling like you are there"". This game makes you feel like you""re somewhere else, struggling to figure out the controls and wishing you were in a great game like COD4,Brother""s in arms or even ""BLACK""!"
4,Well worth the money paid!,"This game is great! I have yet to beat it. I like the fact that you can customize your weapons, add silencer, laser, flashlight, M203 Launcher, Hand grip. The game is alot of fun, there are however alot of video scenes but it makes for a really good game. And you can skip the videos if you want to.The online play is fun too. somethings are a bit confusing and I cant seem to get my Bluetooth head set to work with the online game. There are fun games where one person is Snake (main character) and the rest of the team is hunting Snake and killing the other team.The game is really exciting in alot of parts. And I would reccomend it to anyone that is a fan of shooter games."
4,"Great skill needed, great music",This game took me 24 hours to complete on the normal difficulty. The replay value to the game is huge. You will miss so much on you first run thru you will need to do it again. A second run thru should only take around 5 hoursMusic - As with all the games the music is fantastic. It can get the adrenaline going or it can have you on the verge of tears i know its a game but it has an emotional quality to it). Even though it has become normal to have a fully orchestrated score no game has done it so well before.
3,Half Cut scenes half game play,"It seems like have the time, you are in a cut scene. One cut scene was about 20 minutes long. You can always skip the cut scene, but you then worry that you may not get the storyline later in the game.But I think they could have still told a good storyline with a quarter of the time for the cut scenes."
2,Disappointed,"I've read some long reviews, so I'll make mine short. I've been a fan of MGS since the original PS version. This is by far my least favorite. Although the graphics are stunning and there may be some pretty cool weapons, gameplay is not that good in my opinion.If you buy a video game to watch a story, then you'll love this version. If you actually want to play a game, stick with any number of titles other reviewers mentioned.I really wanted to like this game since I consider MGS and Gran Turismo to be the flagship PS titles, but MGS has been a let-down to say the least. Heck GT for PS3 has been a disappointment too, but that's another story."
2,didn't care for mgs4,I got it to play a video game not watch a crappy movie. I want to play a game not watch hours of stories. The bad thing is to skip the stories you have to press start 4-5 times in a row.I guess if your life is not complete without the metal gear series you will like it. The graphics are great. It seemed easier than other metalgears.If you are in your 30's living in mom's basement with nothing better to do then you will love it.
3,"good game, but no classic","It's a good enough game, but the fact you're sitting through many *many* hours of cutscenes might be enough to rub some people the wrong way. I understand the series is supposed to be about lengthy cutscenes in order to tell a very good, highly detailed story that's honestly unlike anything we've seen in a video game before. But the little amount of gameplay you get to experience prevents the game from being a classic. Still, for RPG fans, and especially storyline fans, you can't go wrong with what's presented here."
1,"If you DO like Call of Duty, do NOT buy this game. IT""S BORING.","For those who like COD 4 and 5 and play from time to time just for fun,my afvise is NOT to buy Metal Gear Solid4. I was expeting more from this boring and repetative game with very plain story and akward control functions. After spending couple of hours installing and watching the ""story line"" and trying to find out what's so exciting about it, I simply quit. The game is NOT worth time and effort. Maybe good for those who like hide and crawl for hours... oh well, let's wait for COD 6 or something more entertaining. Hope that'll help. thanks for reading. SP."
1,This game has lost it.,"I bought this game thinking it would be good. I liked 1 and 2 but after that the game play got very complicated. This game is so complicated to play. I'm not one to spend hours on PS3 but you have to for this one just to learn how to shoot and use your suit right. I got to the point to when I said forget this and I traded it in. It took 15 minutes to start playing the game. Really 15 minutes. I timed it. Other reviews are right there are too many cut scenes and YES the game play is hard to use. I don't want to spend hours learning how to play the game correctly. Here simple, this button is shoot, this button is change weapons, this button is targeting. Why be more complicated than that? 1 and 2 controls were the best. They have lost me here completely."
1,way overrated,I think this may be the most overrated video game of all time. The action is dull. You basically just walk around and shoot people then try to hide when the alarm goes off and get to the next check point. The cutscenes are cool but way too long. I got through most of the game and got near the end that I was so disgusted with this game that I couldn't even finish it. Grand Theft Auto 4 is a much better game than this for the ps3!!
3,More cutscenes than gameplay,"I've played for a few hours so far and I have to say there are way too many cutscenes. It's almost like watching a movie instead of playing a game. After each 2 or 3 minutes of gameplay you get a 4 or 5 minute cutscene.I WANT TO PLAY A GAME NOT WATCH A MOVIE!So far the best games for the PS3 are Resistance FOM and COD4. If you loved those games you will find MGS4 about half as good as either of them in gameplay, but far superior in graphics. Great graphics does not make for great gameplay.I'm waiting impatiently for the REAL PS3 killer app, Resident Evil 5. If it's half as good as RE4 it will blow away MGS4 and any other PS3 game."
1,Disappointing...not nearly as good as COD4,"If you like the action and game play of games such as Call of Duty 4, this is NOT the game for you. The game play is nothing like COD4 (especially online.) However the story line is interesting, but if I wanted that I'd just rent a DVD. I guess COD4 just spoiled me too much."
1,uhmmm... never received it......,"UHmmmm.... let me see.., where do i start, how about this.. (I never received it) so I really don't have much to say..,but i really hope you are looking into my claim that i filed so i can get my refund....thanks"
2,More a cheesy movie than a video game...,"To give you an idea of my gaming preferences, I raelly like the zelda games. This is the first Metal Gear Solid game I have played, and will be the last. If your one of the MGS followers, you'll probably love the game.You spend about 3/4 of your time watching cinematics scenes between gameplay. The general storyline of the game is good, but the gameplay isn't really that interesting, and the cenamatics are somewhat hoaky. I only have time to play games about an hour or two at a time, and the long cinematics make that impossible."
4,If you own a PS3 its worth buying,"For those of us who've been playing MGS4 its brings answers a lot of unanswered questions! now I'm just going to skip to the pros and cons.Pros: Graphics Best I've seen on a console, Good controls, Great Story! Cut scenes as expected are in real time so if a PMC is hanging off the side of your truck they're hanging on the side of your truck during the cut scene making you more emerged with whats going on because it just feels real.cons: Online account setup is really a pain and annoying, the cut scenes are far to often in this then they really should be how ever still worth buying!other thoughts: while I didn't mind, others might get annoyed with the fact that it installs a few different times and not all at once but the install times aren't that bad. 8 mins for the first and 2-4 mins for each time after and its a while between each time (aka hours of game play before you'll see it again).In the end if you own a PS3 its worth buying!"
5,Let me make it short and sweet.,This game is one of the best game made to date. The story keeps you involved the whole way through. If you own a PS3 this is a must buy. I put this game down as an epic tale that needed to be told. I don't know how i will be able to play another game again without comparing it to this one.
5,This is no a game is a movie,"i like this game, i could finally play mgs4 and the cinematic aaaa i love the cinematic of mgs and the history."
4,Very fun game,This game is very detailed with graphics. Has a very long story to it. The cut scenes can get annoying because they are so long. The game is very fun though. Plan on playing through again.
4,Metal Gear Solid 4: Cutscenes of the Patriots,"The game is fun to play but my god are the cut-scenes long. I can sit through 15-30 minute cut-scenes but 45 to 90 minute is just ridiculous. It almost took the fun out of the game. Hideo needs to keep things simple, the older games did not have such lengthy cut-scenes, it almost made me hate this game."
5,A Great Game and a Technical Marvel,"MGS4 is quite a game. The graphics are superb, the gameplay is stellar, the sound is awesome, the replay value is high, it has a pretty good online component, and it's pretty damn fun. The only problem is the ridiculously long cut scenes. Some are great and others are boring as hell. They should have used better judgement and eliminated some of the needless filler and shortened the enite storytelling and added some more gameplay. This game is a technical masterpiece and it's obvious that a tremendous amount of effort went into this game. Could've been absolutely perfect if they just shortened the cut scenes. If you have a PS3 and you're a shooter fan, this is a must buy, period."
5,GREAT GAME!!! and stop whining about the cutscenes...,"This game comes with the highest recommendation i can give, everything from the graphics to the gameplay is as perfect as any game i have ever played. Granted, the cutscenes are ridicoulusly long, but if you appreciate the game and the plotline then you'd find that they are much more interesting.I never write reviews for anything, but the world must know about this game. If you appreciate a great gun game that isnt just run and gun, you MUST buy this game."
3,Metal Gear 4 to much drama!,"It has to much drama! I was bored with the story, it felt like watching a Candy episode, didnt like it!"
5,best game of all time....period!,"I've never played the MGS series so the story line was a bit confusing at first. I've read recommendations that one should play the MGS 1-3 games,--yea right. The best approach is to google search the storyline, read-it, then get to playing. This helped fill-in the blanks for an MGS newbie like myself. The graphics were terrific and gameplay was nonstop. It does take sometime to learn the special take down techniques. This is something you will need to master as you progress further into the game. It gets challenging and I found myself in some cases visiting ""walkthroughs"", but not so much as to spoil the experience. The story-line does include some silly comic relief and some over the top slow-motion action scenes which remind me of John Woo movies. My singular issue with the game is my nagging need to compare all other games to it since finishing it. So far, nothing equals the enjoyment I had with MGS4. I guess I can always hope for MGS5."
4,"A must play, but not a masterpiece","I bought this last month for $19.99. Its definitely worth it for that. Its kinda difficult, especially the last fight with screaming mantis, it took me over an hour to figure it out and beat it. see you tube for help.cut out movie scenes, way too many of them, way too long. i always skipped through them. i dont care for the stupid movie plot, if you have played the series, you might, but if not who cares. its about 16 hours to beat the game.multiplayer is difficult to navigate and no where as fun as other multiplayers such as bc, cod, kz2, etc.... its a nice bonus, hard to master, but for replay its fine.If your unsure about it, wait till its $20 or less then buy.Graphics are very very nice, 1080i, its prob the best graphics to date."
4,i liked it,"This game is one of the funnest game i ever played konami co. it is a 3rd person view game that you need alot of stratigie to beat. its challenging and keeps u there for hours. however i do have a complaint....... as soon as u beat the game on campain u want to play online...... so i beat it and i wanted to move foward so i went online and i needed to laod a couple of files it took a day and a half to do it and plus my ps3 was going to over heat. then when that was over i played and it was very difficult to play and level up. i think to level up u need to be playing for a certain amount of time and not expirence.i thought this was stupid cuz u need to stay on for like 15 hours to level up.and also u need to pay for alot of money for extra features. but wat i thought was cool was u can make ur own guy online and make him look ""pimped"". but sometimes u need to pay. so i enjoyed the campaign not the online.hope u have fun either way!sorry for miss spelling in a rushpeace"
4,A good solid game.,MGS4 is a solid game. One of the only disappointing things that I could possibly think of about this game is all of the cut-scenes that there are and how they drag on and on . You can skip them but it kind of takes away from the story. This game can be quite challenging at certain points which to me makes it more fun. The graphics are good and the game play is great.
5,Guns of the Awesome,"This is, without doubt, the best MGS game to ever exist... if you have just purchased your PS3, you need a game that will push it to the limit. In fact, Otacon occasionally points out how awesome the PS3 is.Everyhing about it is awesome. Each act (I think there are 8 in total) has a different element of gameplay. Long cutscenes, but this time they're jam-packed full of action! Trust me, you wont be skipping many cutscenes in this game. Cool gadgets, a great weapon system, occasional humor, etc... The story is gripping and intense. The climax at the end is incredible... it will leave you on the edge of your couch until the very end."
1,Bad Product,"The Roller Brush on this model easily breaks in two peices and is not covered by the warrenty. I had mine only 2 months when this part broke cleanly in two parts. Service Center was extremely unhelpful and informed me that this was the first complaint they had recieved on the Roller Brush. I contacted an authorized Dirt Devil repair shop and was told that the part was on back order and I would have to wait six to eight weeks for a new part. Apparently the service is worse than the product, DO NOT BUY DIRT DEVIL PRODUCTS."
1,I HATE this vacuum!,"Pros: Bagless, works well at firstCons: Breaks down frequently, the tubes often become blocked despite emptying of the canister in a timely manner, burning rubber smell, and had to replace the belt-twice.Right now my vacuum is sitting in the middle of the living room. I want to vacuum, but I can't. It is broken-again! It isn't as if I use it all that often, so to have it break down so much is quite frustrating. Don't waste your money on this cleaner."
3,Power Cord Issues,"I just got this vacuum for Christmas. I was very excited and immediately started using it. Upon my first time using it, I ran over the power cord. I've done this a million times with my old and much cheaper vacuum cleaner without any problems. However, this vacuum totally ate up one part of the power cord and now it is dangerous to use it."
1,horrible,this design was flawed. I mean it was sorry. You lose suction. there is too much cording at the bottom. I had to use a coat hanger. It is noisy.It is very unreliable.
2,This is self-propelled?,"My biggest complaint is that this vacuum cleaner does NOT feel self-propelled. There are times I have to push hard to get it to move. It's almost more difficult than my NON self-propelled cleaner! The cord is also in a bad location and is difficult to keep up with. The suction seems good, though."
1,I HATE THIS DEVIL,"there...I think my title best describes how I feel about this piece of junk! Read all the reviews..I have the same complaints...from the cord up to the handle. this vacuum leaves me cussing every time I use it. And I am not that kind of person but this just brings out the worst in me. I especially love cleaning my house but ever since I got this vacuum, I dread the day I had to clean my house, knowing how painful and horrible it will be. I should have bought Hoover instead. My last Hoover lasted 11 years before I had to buy this garbage. Hoover may be a bit pricey but it sure as hell's worth it!"
2,"Good suction, lousy construction.","We have had ours for a couple years and have never been disappointed with the cleaning power. We also have been pleased with the light weight and maneuverability, as well as the great assortment of attachments. Overall this machine is very easy to use and versatile.My only complaint, and it's a significant one, is that the physical construction seems to be substandard at best. Even with routine use and wear, our cleaner is just plain falling apart. Various parts have come loose or fallen off altogether, and the catch which holds the machine in the upright position doesn't work anymore. I cannot attribute these conditions to ill-use on our part -- we're just not that hard on our home appliances. We also have two neighbors who own one of these, and they have both experienced the same problem. Who knows, maybe you'll have better luck, but I wouldn't chance it."
2,Dangerously sucky,"I hate this vacuum. I used it for about 15 minutes today and its loud high frequency screaming made my ears ring horribly afterwards, which is absolutely frightening. Emptying it is messy and dusty. The hose comes apart during use, although it is still brand new.It seems to have adequate power and the bagless idea was good, but needs tweaking to keep it from being so messy, and no one should market a product for household use that is so loud. Next time I vacuum I will either be using a new vacuum or I'll be wearing earplugs."
2,I don't want to wait for the thing to be ready,"We have always been huge fans of Dirt Devil vacuums. 6 months ago we decided to take a leap and buy a different brand and purchased a Fantom bagless. When that kicked the bucket after only 6 months of use (a whole different review) We went back to the store for a tried and true Dirt Devil.We got this vacuum home and it was very easy to assemble. When we turned it on we found out that it was easily the loudest vacuum cleaner we've ever used.The self propel feature, although a great idea, leaves a lot to be desired. I vacuum fast, and with this cleaner was unable to because of the hesitation in the self propel motion. It takes a while to realize that you've changed direct and respond.There is a switch to turn the self propel off. However I felt that spending the extra money on the self propel feature made that too much of a compromiseI wouldn't recommend this cleaner to anyone who has sensitive ears or likes to vacuum quickly."
1,Worst vacuum ever!,"I recently purchased this vacuum and was completely disappointed. It was so loud that it actually made my ears ring for over half an hour after I was done vacuuming, it tore one of my rugs, AND when I accidentally ran over the power cord (as I had done hundreds of times with previous vacuums) it actually TORE the cord, rendering it unsafe and unusable. I will never buy another Dirt Devil product and will be writing the company asking for compensation for my torn carpeting. I am disgusted by this product!"
1,Poor Design,I have had this vacum for about 6 months now. It has great suction but very poor design. The cord is attached to the bottom half of the sweeper and I've run it over several times even when holding the cord in one hand while sweeping. The cord was severed once. It is much too powerful to sweep heavy duty scatter rugs. I've torn several expensive rugs. The body of it is high off the ground and doesn't fit under my kitchen cabinets (between floor and cabient is about 6 inches). It is so heavy to push even with the self-propelled on that the plastic handle broke off and I have it duct-taped on now.Bottom Line - I do not recommend this sweeper!
5,Very Nice Utensils!,"I am very pleased with these utensils. I've been looking for a while, and these are perfect. They fit the hand nicely, and are good for lefties (like me!) and the rest of my family can also use them too. They are very durable and won't bend like other cheaply made utensils."
5,My favorite one!,"I 'm an English as a second language teacher and this is my favorite dictionary, especially for beginners. I 've just purchased my second one on December 15th, 2012. I got my first one through an English course I took in 1998. It has a great amount of words, these words are currently used in the update world. it also has the closest pronounciation of all words in written form. The only thing I don't like much is its volume because is sometimes unconfortable to handle it fast."
4,My wife likes it,"I bought this parfum following my wife's suggestions, but I like the soft lasting smell it gives to me. I use during the day and in some nights too."
4,Everything I expected,I have bought this fragrance for my husband before and we both really love it. It is a clean masculine scent. The price was excellent! I got double the amount for 50% of the price at regular walk-in stores. Very satisfied!
4,Good warm weather scent,"Blvgari Blv goes well with a warm sunny day. A former reviewer said it doesn't last long. At this typing, I've had mine on for about 4 hours and it's still very noticeable."
1,Ugh. Migraine producing,Someone bought some for my bf; the scent makes me think of baby powder and chalk and always pushes me to the brink of a migraine.
1,NOT complete!,"Part of the description reads, ""AT THIS THEATRE tells the complete history of Broadway in the 20th century, theatre by theatre.""This is not true. NONE of the plays that I know were on Broadway and I have playbills for were in this book. When I first looked at it at the bookstore, I wasn't able to see inside the book as it was wrapped in plastic so I was unable to note that before I bought it. I bought it and now I will be returning it."
3,A GOOD HISTORY OF EACH OF THE BROADWAY THEATRES,"I own the first edition of this book and washappy to see the new edition come out.(The first edition was in 1984)It is tells the history of the 40 Broadway theatreswhich are currently being used in NYC.It is filled with tons of photos from the playswhich have taken place in each theatre as well asphotos of other memorabilia related to the theatre.The one thing that the books lacks are historicand contemporary photos of the theatre interiors.There are some color photos of the New Amsterdambut very few others.I think that the book would have had an added dimensionwith interior photos of the theatres themselves.Even without the theatre photos, I would still recommendthis book to any student or fan of Broadway theatre."
3,Theatres,"As I bought this book as a birthday gift for a theatre loving friend, I did not have a great deal of time to peruse it.I found that is a very good guide to the history of theatres in New York, So many wonderful photographs, of all thosegreats of the New York stage. I am sure that my friend will spend many wonderful hours reading this book . ThanksPlaybill for doing it Les Breen"
3,Nice compilation of Broadway history,"Imagine a compilation of about 40 articles where each one focuses on a different extant Broadway Theatre and you have a notion of what is in this book. Each article covers ownership, architecture, a narrative list of many of the productions the Theater hosted (along with notable cast members) and is accompanied by informative photos. Because it is organized by existing theaters, this is not the most accessible way to learn Broadway history and there are some gaps. Also a map of where the theaters are located would have been nice. But there are treasures to be found here. It's not 'Lion King' but it's worth the price of admission."
4,makes great cappuccinos,I really love the look of the coffee maker. It makes great cappuccino and coffee and performs these tasks very quickly. My only problem is that you have to hold the lid open on the coffee pot when you pour or otherwise the coffee spills everywhere. It's a small price to pay but it gets annoying telling guests to open the lid.
3,hmm,i loved the product when on but when i was putting it on the fishnet ripped on the side. shotty product would be much better if fishnet was more durable
3,Excellent but...,"wearing this comes in a good result & really good one. he admired this outfit and praised it. but when it comes the quality, it is not the good. The thong was easily torn before even try it on, i wore another one that i already have. i believe this is good only to be worn once."
4,Hubby & I Enjoyed it!,"This product was wonderful and worked well with my curves. The fishnet stockings were two different sizes, but you can play with it to make it look no different. Honestly, after you partner sees that the open bust chances are they will not be worried about your legs. lol. My husband thought it looked amazing and he is a very honest person! I give this a 4 because of the fact that the stockings were not the same length. I analyzed the picture of the models and it seems to me that the models may have the same issue. It is well worth the price!! Go for it!"
2,difficult and delicate,Once you figure out how to put this on its not half bad. The material is very cheap though. Intended for one time use.
3,"OK, not great","It's pretty cheap -- the fishnet thong tore when I put it on (and I'm not a fatty!!)It's also REALLY confusing if you try to put it on while you're drunk, and even a little difficult to figure out when sober. Set aside some time to put this on if you want it to look good."
5,Sexy,"I didn't expect it to look as good on me as it did on the picture, but it really looks and feels that sexy. Buy it and you won't regret it. :)"
3,Cheesy but fun,"This is not high quality merchandise but it sure is fun!The fishnet fabric is a bit flimsy and droopy after a few minutes of wear. However, given the likely circumstance in which this garment will be worn, a few minutes is all you'll be wearing it.I bought it in red. Perhaps the black would look a little less cheesy. Overall, the garment fit okay but not great. The stockings seem to be fairly durable."
2,Sexy Fishnet Open Bust 3 Piece Lingerie Set - One Size,Was nice but cheaply made. The Thigh highs had holes in the toes from the get go !!!
2,Non-sophisticated product,The product and the picture are two different items. Once you put it on it does not look the same way as the picture due to the fact that there are different size holes between the two. I would not recommend anybody purchase this product unless they're 100% sure they look good in fishnet.
2,a bit difficult,"I ordered this item recently and it is pretty tricky. Im all about little nightgowns or 1 piece lingerie. This one takes some time to get it right. Don't get me wrong its sexy, but save it for when you have time to prepare throughly!!"
1,NOT A GOOD BUY,"This was a waist of my money. It is sooooo outdated. Maybe if you are stuck in the 80's this would be good for you, but not for building a website with todays style."
1,Waste of time and money,"This is not for Mac people. It seems to be the story of such a small nice that unless your in it, you won't get a thing out of it. That is the trouble with buying books online, the title can seem to be in your need zone, but if I could have looked at it for 2 minutes first, I never would have bought it. Sorry, it was just useless to me."
5,I pick another winner from Mr. Kaufman,"A friend recommended Steve Kaufman's instructional guitar DVD's to me about a year ago. I started with the three DVD set ""Learning to Flatpick"", a must-have for any flatpicking student. I added ""The Art of Guitar Crosspicking"" and ""Picking Up Speed.""Steve provides slowed-down versions of tunes, as well as easy-to-read tablature.""Figuring Out the Fingerboard"" continues the excellent series. Steve's easy-going manner, and desire to help the struggling and accomplished students alike are evident in his teaching methodology. His picking technique is clean and simple. I've learned more in the past year than I have in the past ten, thanks to Steve's DVD's. My picking confidence and tune repertoire have definitely been ramped up.Pick up this one, and start playing ""up the neck"" in no time flat."
2,"Should be called ""For Beginners""","The description to this DVD should identify it as ""For Beginners"" I've been playing most of my life and I was looking for something more than this DVD offers.If you are a beginner, this will teach you a bunch."
3,Many areas to improve,"I bought it for my 2002 Toyota Sienna van in September 2006. There was no functional defect in the hitch I bought. The price was good too. For me, I paid $110 for it + free shipping. However, the finish was so bad that the paint peels off each time I go to install the bike carrier. The packaging is not protective for the hitch. When UPS dropped in my driveway, part of the hitch came out. I complained to Amazon, they were willing to settle the damage with 20% off. Now, I have to figure out how to spray-paint the hitch."
1,NEver received product,"I never received the book and frankly, I forgot to complain about it. If the store from which I ordered the book gets this message, please contact me and send me the book, please."
2,Really cheesy,'80's mixes are so cheesy and this one takes the cake. The album Version is MUCH better. It's on the Virgin album. Go get that instead!
4,Angel Remix Brings New Life,The Angel Remix Brings New Life to the song...c'mon you know in the old days when we would hear that song we'd all start dancin like madonna...well with this remix youll be dancing harder than ever...It has that classic madonna sound we are just now getting back with american pie and ray of light...it has dubs of people chanting MADONNA MADONNA MADONNA...and youll chant right along...for the true madonna fan.
3,Somewhat Disappointed With Remix. Into The Groove Made The Sale.,"I did not find the remix to Angel very good. At first I thought it was just a live version and in being such, the energy of the song was weaker than that of the original version. I must say it was original and it was cute hearing the crowd chanting Madonna's name, but nonetheless, it just did not pack as much a punch like the original version and as a dance mix, it was rather weak. For me, the selling point for this 12"" is ""Into The Groove"" which was not going to be remixed (to my disappointment) at the time of it's release (although it did receive a remixing for the ""You Can Dance"" album)."
4,Get Into The Groove,I bought this cd for the Extended Mix of Angel. I prefer the original version and there's really not much difference. It's mixed to sound like it was live. I would only recommend this cd if you're a Madonna collector or looking for the original version of Into The Groove!
3,Three Alexander Calders,"One particular work of Alexander Stirling Calder has inspired me to live, learn and write. For that, I am eternally grateful. His statue of Leif Eirkisson, possibly the most famous statue of the Norse Explorer in the world, is a true tribute to the power of the Viking Age."
5,GREAT PRODUCT! GREAT PRICE!,"What a great deal from BargainCell! Like already posted, this is a genuine LG product. When it comes to cell phone batteries and chargers (and digital cameras accessories), it's best to use OEM equipment, despite the extra cost. Why risk it just to save a couple of bucks?This product arrived in a sealed, padded envelope but was in an open plastic bag inside the padded envelope. No OEM papers, OEM packaging or anything, but that didn't matter. As long as it arrived as advertised is fine with me! FAST, too! Arrived in only 4 days after order!Check to be sure it will work with your phone before ordering. You can't go wrong with this one!"
2,came with wrong gaskets,Part came with incorrect gaskets for the engine it was made for. I had to go and buy correct gasket at $5.00 each
5,Home Office Handbook,Home Office Handbook is great! It tells you what to do with technology in the home office and not just how to decorate the office. And I needed help. I manage a group of apartment buildings at a univerity town and have an office in one of the buildings and another in my home. This book was a major help in figuring out wht I needed in each office and how to connect the offices. It also helped the technician that was working with me.
3,Pretty! Too tall for me to walk in.,"I think these shoes are attractive, well-made and true-to-size. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how dang tall they are. I felt like a baby giraffe. Do not buy these shoes if you aren't accustomed to walking in tall shoes. I ended up giving them away to a friend who is a bit more graceful than me. I am sure she loved them!"
4,HOPE MOUNTAIN,OVERALL IT WAS A GOOD BOOK. IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I HAVE READ BEFORE BY JON LAND.
3,Hope Mountain--Land's attempt at a sympathetic story,"Surely Hope Mountain is unlike the typical Jon Land story: mystery, murder, mayhem. Jon has written well over 15 books in the theme of the aforementioned words; Hope Mountain provides more a peaceful alternative. Regardless of my opinion on the content of the book, the overall message that Land hits home with is tremendous. I learned much about disabled skiing, specific injuries, and the nature of Loon Mountain's Adaptive Ski School. I am sure to have a new perspective of the various skiers I come across with at the slopes this winter!!"
4,Great Compliment to my other vacuum!!!!!,"I have alot of tile in my home and sweeping the ""Ghost Turds"" & crumbs around gets old fast. Yes this vacuum is loud, I did not feel it was any louder than any other vacuum, and any one that feels it was monsterously loud should use a cordless dustbuster; and a dustbuster wouldn't even get around a standard home's toilet). Incredibly powerful. It's size will fool you on it's performance. Recommendations for improvement - longer cord and reduce the amount/force and/or redirect the discharged air."
2,Dirt Devil M084100 Power Stick,"I can't believe that I paid $49.99 for this crap. Amazon is far cheaper at $39.99. Anyway, this thing is just too damn loud. If you think a lion roar is loud, this thing is at least ten times louder. But I will admit that this vac is extremely powerful for this size. It suckz up just about anything on the floor while it wildly goes left and right uncontrollably. If you were deaf, I would recommend this product to you. If you do have a pair of ears, please don't buy it for your next-door neighbor's sake."
1,TOO LOUD to use,Although I will admit that it a very powerful vac. that doesn't mean anything when it is TOO LOUD to use. It actually hurts my ears. I called Dirt Devil and they were very unhelpful. I will remember the quality of their customer service the next time I am looking for a vac.
3,THE LOUDEST VACUUM EVER!,"This vacuum works, but its the LOUDEST VACUUM EVER. Doggies hide, people flee, and your ears will ring. I have owned many vacuums and shop-vacs, and the Dirt Devil Powerstick is the loudest of all. I recommend earplugs with every purchase."
5,no title,i found this vaccuum cleaner the best one i have had over the last few years. i have had 2 others which i will not mention but i find this vacuum does a lot better job of cleaning and does a fantastic job. thank you.
1,Don't waste your money on this !!!!!,"the most horrible vacuum ever !!!! It is so loud my 2 year old holds his ears closed when I vacuumed. Yes, ""vacuumed"", I replaced it with a Miele. What a difference...The dirt devil is not only loud but the air return is in a place where it blows your dust/dirt around while you are vacuuming, the same dirt you are trying to get rid off, you end up with a dust cloud in the air, not to mention you are breathing it in again. You are wasting your money if you buy this product."
1,"okay, but over-rated.","I bought this in light of some fantastic reviews, but it has managed to scratch up our brand new flooring and seems to blow around dust and pet hair instead of picking it up. The only place where it works is on the berber and the low profile area rugs. Not worth the sound."
2,"Loud, but eventually cleans up dust","This vacuum works well if you are approaching dirt directly from the front. If you need to back up to reach a side area, the venting creates a gust that blows all the dirt away before it can get sucked up. As noted by other reviewers, it is *very* noisy. I actually question if the noise it produces is within allowable limits for noise exposure/hearing loss.I could tolerate the noise if the product was exceptional, but the air venting makes the vacuum mostly useless."
2,All the energy seems to go to the noisecreator,"If the almost painful noise was anything to go by this machine would rip up the nails fastening the carpet to the floor. Instead, it leaves the carpet almost as it was before I vacuumed it. It seems to get rid of the dust, but everything bigger than a breadcrumb is above its capability. I regret the day a exchanged my mini Black & Decker for this underperformer."
4,This little sucker really sucks!,"I hate to vacuum. My motto is: Dust is a protective coating. But sometimes, you really have to vacuum, and this little guy really works. We have laminate floors and no pets, so it is just picking up dust, and of course, clay, since both my husband and I play tennis on soft courts, and occasionally, one of us forgets to take his shoes off. For the price, you can't beat it. Down side is it is a little loud, but if it works, sobeit."
3,"Great for long hair, but that's about it.","This vacuum is great for long hair, no brushes or other parts for it to get caught in. Suction is good as well, but you have to keep going over the dirt as it doesn't always pick up well. Can't get corners or under beds either."
2,Dirt Devil 10 Amp Power Stick,"This unit is powerful, cumbersome, and noisy like a jet fighter. It works well on low pile carpet and very poorly on most other applications. While the cleaning path is 11"" wide it is only effective in the center 4"" opening. The G2 cordless sweeper is actually a better product. Very disappointing. This product is so poorly engineered you will be chasing dust and dirt as the air vents blow it all over your house. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."
2,Do not get stuck with this stick!,"+powerful suction+lightweight+picks up crumbs and cheerios under kitchen baseboard very well-EXTREMEMLY loud. My ears ring after using it-engine cooling vents blow dust, paper, paper napkins 3 feet behind me as I move forward. Imagine what it does to the dust and crumbs it misses on the first pass.-did I mention VERY loud-not ""thin"" enough to fit between toilet and wall in bathroomI have been searching for the ""perfect"" floor cleaner for my kitchen, bathroom, and entry....all hard floors. We have 4 young kids and keeping up after crumbs, crafts, and outdoor debri is a challenge. I tried the Hoover Floor Mate, but it does not get within 3 inches of walls and corners. It is also slow to use. I also tried the Dirt Devil sweeper vac with swiffer, but it was not powerful enough, and also not trim enough to fit around the toilet in the bathroom.I'll STICK with a good old fashioned broom, and my trim, easy, clorox quick mop. They are both QUIET!"
2,TOO LOUD!,"While this unit is fairly light and powerful it is amazingly LOUD. IN fact, after using for a few minutes, my ears ring! And both my children run for cover. Plus, the air vents are so close to the ground, if you are cleaning hard floors, the air blows around whatever you are trying to suck up."
1,Not good,"Bought this vacuum to use exclusively on three small black rugs in my kitchen, but have relagated it to the laundry room tile floor. Does not pick up much off carpet."
2,Bad choice,"I bought the dirt devil because I have hardwood floors with throw rugs. I felt it would be ideal to clean the rugs. I found it to be very hard to use. it drags along the rugs and takes extra effort just to complete the task. It may be better suited for wall to wall carpets but not for the purpose I had in mind. Definitely a wrong choice for me.Dirt Devil Power Stick Bagless Vacuum Cleaner, 10 Amps, M084100RED"
4,Excellent for RVers,"Our RV is mostly vinyl floor with a couple small carpeted areas. This stick does the best job for RV use we have found, and we've tried a lot of them. It does a fine job at sucking up those little crumbs that always seem to accumulate around the bottom of the cabinets. You do have to go at them straight on as the edge suction is poor, but we found if you just drive into the cabinet bottom then slide the head side to side works great. The key to keeping it working at its optimum suction is to keep the filter clean. If you have an air compressor it will blow out any remaining dust after you tap it against the inside of a garbage can which shakes off the big stuff."
2,"Noisy but Lightweight, Effective","The vacuum really is noisy. I wear ear plugs when I use it because it is so loud and the noise actually gets painful in narrow halls. I refuse to use it when my dog is in the house and eventually I will have to get a quieter vacuum. For now, though, I like that the vacuum is lightweight, easy to maneuver and picks up the dog hairs and the daily debris."
2,Sucks good...but too loud and windy!!,"I like how it picks things up (I'm always vacuuming bird seed), and I like how light and portable it is, regardless of it needing to be plugged into a wall socket. ****However, I hate how loud it is; and the wind that exhausts from the side vents blows anything that's shin-level to the floor...including blowing around any light dust you're trying to pick up!!!!**** How dumb is that?!?!? I actually did a jerry-rig, and taped V-shaped cone-like pieces of paper over the side vents to direct the wind upward. That remedied blowing things around, but now I can dry my hair and sinuses at the same time!!!! All-in-all it does the job I need it to do, but I wouldn't buy it again without design alterations . . . are ya listenin' Dirt Devil/Hoover????"
2,As bad as all the other reviews say,"I have to agree with the majority of the reviews I read about how worthless this thing is. I got it as a bonus item with a full-size vacuum. It is so loud you'd think there was some power in it, but on carpet it just pushes the dirt around. The only thing it does a lot better on is hardwood floors, so I use it only in the kitchen and the laundry room. I would have brought it back if it wasn't included with the other vacuum."
1,It's going back to the store.,"I bought this item because it boasted 12 amps and ""the strongest"" suction available. Sure, it picks up dirt. However, it is EXTREMELY loud! My children literally cried when I turned it on. Second, after you turn the unit off half the stuff falls back onto the floor. A complete waste of money. My Shark died after three years, but I'm going to get another one anyway."
1,Jet Airplane Noise - Returned it Immediately,"This beast seemed to vaccuum reasonably well, but was outrageously noisy - so much so that I was concerned that it would cause hearing damage.I immediately packed this puppy up and returned it."
3,Wear ear protection and put the dog out!,"Too say it's loud is an understatement, the word you want is deafening! The little thing roars, scares the dog, and falls over occasionally. Kinda reminds me of one of my relatives. I gave it 3 stars because it works well, takes very little space to store, the dust dealie is easy to empty and I like the red color. If I had to do it again I wouldn't, that said I threw away the box and receipt in a fit of efficiency so I'm stuck with it."
2,Unreasonably loud,"This vacuum is very powerful but without a spinning brush on the bottom on hard surfaces it blows a lot of the dust and debris away from the suction. And honestly, it is painfully and I'm assuming dangerously loud.While it's light and may have done the job for me I knew I would dread using it because it was so loud.Who wants more reasons to be discouraged from cleaning?"
2,Do not buy,"This stick vac is powerful alright. The problem is that the opening on the bottom of the unit is too small. Forget about corners, unless you are positioned right over what you intend to vacuum it won't get sucked up. It is way too loud and blows all of the dog hair and dirt all over the floor. I am returning it an getting something else!"
3,TOO LOUD!,"This vacuum picks up well on bare floors, no better or worse than other brands I've used, but it is just much too loud. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this (not on Amazon) looking for an inexpensive vacuum cleaner for some occasional vacuuming. It's inexpensive for a reason...it's useless.It's adequate on hardwood or bare floors. However, if you're looking to use this on carpets, don't bother. This vacuum picks up virtually nothing on carpets. For all intents and purposes, this vacuum is useless on carpets. It'll pick larger particles, but then again, I can do that by hand.If you're looking to save some money by buying this inexpensive vacuum, don't bother; it's useless."
1,It has no brushes in it's head,"I bought this thing from Amazon in March. I read the on site reviews and got the jest that there were equal pros and cons but by looking at the Amazon's on-site photos and description that it was for carpets, as well as hard floors, I thought HEY it has a brush in the head of it. I was soooo wrong. This thing has nothing but a squeegee and a 9 inch slit. It has no suction for the amount of noise it makes and weight that it has. Please pass on it and complain if you bought it and you can not get your FULL REFUND!!! I STILL trying to get mine!"
1,No Power at All,"I thought this would be great for my kitchen hardwood floors but it barely picks up dust let alone anything else. Mine is going in the trash, and I'll be looking for something better."
4,Pretty good little guy!,"I bought this with a gift card I received for my birthday. I said I was going to splurge and buy something just for me that I really didn't need and wouldn't normally spend on myself. So, what do I buy? A vacuum cleaner!! Anyway, it's a pretty good vacuum. Nice and lightweight for quick jobs on floors. Not the most powerful for carpets, but it's not really designed for that. It's just as quick as, or even quicker than a broom and you don't have to pick up the debris afterward. Emptying the debris cylinder is very easy. However, be warned that it's a little loud. Over all I like it and would recommend it."
2,Too Powerful for its own good,"I just bought this and used it two times. Like others said, its very powerful. But the power works against it.First of all, when I started it up, it jumped out of my hands. The noise is deafening...seriously. It is much, much louder than my very powerful full upright. My ears actually were ringing when I was done.It also was frustrating because the ""exhaust"" comes out at an angle that blows around the very dirt you are about to vacuum. The smaller amped Dirt Devil stick vac works much better. I plan to return it for the smaller one."
2,"Power Stick works OK, but does have some issues",The power stick does have a lot of power but post about how loud it is and how it blows dust around before you can vacuum it are accurate. I would rather have purchased something else
1,Useless,"I bought this Power Stick yesterday at Target and attempted to use it on my laminate-wood kitchen floor last night. It literally picked up nothing but a little bit of dust, leaving crumbs untouched, yet it roared like a mini jet engine. Very deceiving because with noise like that one would expect it to be the Hercules of vacuums. Needless to say, it is already packed back in it's box and will be returned asap!"
1,NOT recommended,"I was looking for a small and efficient vacuum for our 1500 SF townhouse with hardwood floors. This vacuum, which I purchased from Target in store, sucks. Actually, it does the opposite. Instead of picking things up, it blows them around. It does pick up SOME stuff, but chasing the little pieces is fruitless, and I just end up using a broom. I paid $40 for this and am returning it 3 days after I bought it. Additionally, this is the loudest vacuum I've ever heard-including shop vacs. Put your money towards a better quality vacuum-not dirt devil. I'm buying a Hoover Flair with Power Nozzle as this vacuum's replacement, as it has very positive reviews on Amazon. It's worth an extra $20. DO NOT BUY this vacuum...unless you like your money going down the drain. :)"
1,Beware!,"I agree many of the other reviewers -- this product is dangerously loud! I frequently attend concerts and like my music louder than anyone I know and still find this product painfully loud -- so much that my ears ring for hours after use. Aside from this, this vacuum only sucks things up in the 2-3 inches straight down the center of its path. Sweeping along the edge of a wall is useless unless you approach the wall perpendicularly, going back and forth incrementally down the length of the wall. A piece of junk. It gets 1 star for not breaking during the 11 months that I used it."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this machine a few months ago and was happy....at first. The first thing I noticed was that there are vents on the sides of the machine. Turn it on and air shoots out of the sides. This is fine for carpets, but on hardwood floor/tile floors, it stirs up all the dust. By the time you get to the area where the dust was, it is now sitting someplace else. This is frustrating for me, because I have a cat. I will see an area that has collected some cat hair, go to vacuum it, and see that it is being propelled across the room by these vents. I've resorted to covering them up. It is a very powerful vacuum, but I would not recommend it for pet owners or people looking to clean their bare floors. I completely agree with the other reviewer's comment about it being VERY loud."
4,good little vacuum,"Living in southwest Florida, all our floors are ceramic tile. This little vacuum does a good job of cleaning all the floors. One caveat is, it is noisy!"
1,Too strong an exhaust,"I bought the Power Stick to have something quick to get the dog hair from my kitchen floor. The dogs are shedding and I didnt want to drag out my big vac all the time. Sweeping didnt help since the hair drifted under the fridge and stove. The first time I turned on the Power Stick I was impressed at the suction and began to clean my floor. To my dismay the exhaust blew the hair and dust across the room and under my stove and fridge in a split second. You would have to be very careful which direction you began to vacuum a floor because of this. I wrote the company to bring this to their attention, NOT to ask for a refund. I got an e-mail back stating they did not give refunds and they never mentioned my complaint. I was very disappointed in their reaction and I doubt I will buy any Dirt Devil products in the future."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT AND HEAVY TOO,Don't bother. LOUD and doesn't pick up because has no rollers to sweep up ....just some air business underneath that you can't see that does NOT work well on carpet ever.. but occasionally passable on hardwood or tile
2,Unbelievably loud,I read another reviewer that said they wore earplugs when they use this vacuum. I'm glad to see that I am not the only one. The noise this vacuum makes is deafening. I would not recommend it based solely on this.
2,Too Loud,"YES, THIS MACHINE HAS POWER, BUT I HAVE TO SHOUT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I'VE LOST MY HEARING.Seriously though, we had to return it after a week...it was that loud. I wanted the most powerful stick vac out there, till i used it. Having to use ear plugs was the deal breaker."
1,1 Star because there isn't an option for ZERO!,"This thing is horrible. NO suction -- worked well for about 7 minutes and then all suction just died. Now, it won't even pick up simple spills and every-day dirt! I put my hand underneath the unit and there's NO suction! I've emptied the cup, cleaned the filter...I do NOT recommend this product at all."
4,LOUD Sucker!,"Whoa! I was really surprised how loud this thing is! Sometimes my ears hurt after clean up my studio.The motor is surprisingly powerful for such a tiny vac. My floors looked pretty clean to begin with, but this vac proved otherwise. In two sweeps of the floor, I was able to fill up the debris compartment with lint, hair, and other nasties.I really like this vac.1. I breath a lot easier now, thanks to the integrated air filter.2. It's high quality ABS construction and very intuitive to assemble/de-assemble.3. Extremely powerful motor.But it's too LOUD! If you get this vac, buy a pair of ear plugs..."
1,Piece of junk,"This little stick vac is very loud and has excellent suction, the problem is that is boast an 11"" head that only has suction in the middle 3 inches, so to pick anything up you must be able to position the middle of the head over the dirt or it does not pick the dirt up. Mine was three months today and I just threw it away. Now I'm back to using my full size Eureka vac for my wood floors (not a great bare floor cleaner but MUCH better then this piece of junk)."
4,Dirt Devil Power Stick is definitely powerful.,"This little thing actually jumps when you start it, it has so much power. But, it is a little weighty and when the filter starts to get dirty, the power minimizes quickly, so it needs emptied a lot when cleaning a lot of dirt. These are the only two drawbacks that I have found...otherwise, I love it."
1,Not for lots of pet hair,"This vacuum is powerful, however, I have 7 dogs and a cat, it blew the hair away from it before it could pick it up. To me it is a poor design, the blower for the motor should be on the rear somewhere. Amazon on the other hand is amazing. I received this item super fast and had no problems receiving a refund!"
3,good vac. but very noisy,This vacuum has more torque than my full size upright. It will almost jump out of your hand when you turn it on. It leaves nothing on the floor behind it but you better wear hearing protection when you run it.
2,instead buy van Seters' The Edited Bible,"Unfortunately I had read van Seters' The Edited Bible before buying this book. I give this book 2 stars for ""negative research"", ie reading the principal articles in this book demonstrates the interminable complexity of 'European??' approaches to the history of the OT. van Seters' response (in this book) ends by recommending his own The Edited Bible (published the year after this book) which demonstrates his stellar scholarship, integrity, creativity, and readability. I enjoy the breadth of scholarship (and the quiet humor) in all his books."
5,"You are there, in Sierra Leone, during the past ten years.","For people from Sierra Leone, this book verifies the stories and rumors that they have been hearing over the years. The excellent pictures speak for themselves. References are there so that the reader may continue to read more about the devastation of a people from a peaceful country. For those who don't know about the tragedy going on in West Africa, this book tells all."
3,"Great Film, Disappointing Format…","Apparently, getting a widescreen version of this movie is a very hit-or-miss proposition. What I received was a full-screen version, and while that will do—the movie itself is still fun and funny and kinda nuts—I really don't understand why this format confusion has to exist."
2,Too heavy,"The bat arrived on time in perfect condition. However, this bat is too heavy to be used for tennis ball cricket, and the grip hurts if used with bare hands. The weight is more close to what a leather ball bat should be. I have not tried using it on a leather ball but if you are looking for a tennis ball bat, look elsewhere."
2,"Leaky, Rusty Garbage!","These lights you would expect to perform halfway decently being from Hella, but quite the contrary! I mounted these on a 2001 Jetta in Dec. and already in March one lamp refused to drain moisture and the reflector has rusted over already! I contacted hella by email, who will not make a phone contact available, and they refuse to answer or stand behind their product. I was first told that the seller would warranty them for a year, which amazon does not after 30 days even though they haven't held up worth a crap, and upon contacting Hella again, they will not respond. Word of advice, you might as well spend the 50 bucks on two sets of lamps from walmart because they probably will last longer or at least you will have replacements! These are garbage, DONT buy from hella unless you get it from a store-based distributor that will stand behind their product."
3,LEAKY LIGHTS,"LAMPS OPERATED AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED FOR A COMPACT DUAL DESIGN BUT WITHIN 2 YEARS, WATER ENTRY HAD CORRODED THE INTERNAL REFLECTORS"
3,They're Optilux : not really Hella & are ok if you get a good price; updated 2/20/10,"I put these on my wifes minivan where space was limited. They never threw a great light pattern, fog and driving lights being pretty similiar with the clear lenses & focusing either is next to impossible. I paid 40 dollars for my set and they've lasted 2 years now but I just noticed one of the lenses took a road debris hit and cracked.I would buy them again but not for 50 dollars. I also will look around first.For tight spaces they are good enough and look kinda cool. Dont expect hella quality from them though.UPDATE 2/20/10. Both lights have cracks, one bulb died within weeks (replaced fairly easily) so they are still working. I have replacement units (different lights) but won't swap them until these finally die. I still wish Hella did a better Quality Control job on these. These are an average value in my book, not great."
3,Not a deal breaker...,"Very bright lights. Heavy and sturdy but the seal around the lens and the light is not very good. I had moisture in one of the light the second day after I drove in some storms. Not a huge deal breaker if you put some clear silicone around the edges like I did but it was a paid to take it back out, fix it, then re-install it back into the bumper."
1,bad product its got moisture in the lense on the first day it rained,I wrote the person that sold me this no reply 2 times i was going to open a case but decided they wouldn't let me return because i hooked it up but looks like the seal around the lighs are mushed out a bit and the screws well they arent all the way in on two places and i coudn't get them to go in so they are cheap made but they give off good light brighter then low beam silver star premiums in my caddy i would like a replacement but the cool thing is the dual beams you could put the high end 100 watt bulbs in both sides and have really good lighting. I just cant becausse the screws are messed up.
4,great,"Had these on my old truck. They were great. The driving lights weren't amazing, but the fogs were great - great in rain/snow/fog, and wonderful angle of illumination - they lit up the front yards of houses on both sides of the street!"
2,Dual Mode fog/driving lamps,"Worked great, but the bolts and outer cases rusted right away. First cold spell both lenses cracked and one fell off.Great idea, bad implementation. I would have paid more for better quality."
2,They would be great if build quality didn't suck,Nice small twin beam lights that put out decent light considering size and price. Unfortunately the first time it rains or you wash your car they get fogged up inside and stay that way for weeks. Plus the lenses are not replaceable so if one cracks you throw the entire light out.I dumped these and got a set of PIAA twin beams. They cost four times as much but put out more light and will probably last ten times as long.
2,Leaking on Day 2 of Installation,"This product is retaining moisture inside of the clear lens on the 2nd day of operation. I placed a bead of clear silicone around the lens seal and the back seal prior to installation, hoping this would help avoid moisture infiltration. I am so disappointed in this----the internal wiring and workmanship are good, but why didn't they do a better job of sealing the lens? Customers should not have to reseal / reseat lenses out of the box.I have asked Amazon for a replacement. I have no box for the product and they are already installed on my truck. I shouldn't have to disassemble two lights and ship back for a resolution to my problem with these. We will see what happens....in the meantime, I have a foggy fog light---go figure."
5,Sibelius: Symphonies 5 & 6,"This is a wonderful album for a Sibelius fan or any lover of classical music. The sound quality is fabulous, capturing a marvelous performance with crystal clarity. The liner notes are very informative, too!"
4,One of Verne's best books,"One of the greatest adventure books of all time, whose basic plot has been copied by many other books and movies (including the Die Hard films). In the 1850s, the Argentine navy erects a lighthouse at Isla de los Estados, in the southern tip of South America, near the Magellan Strait that connects the Atlantic and the Pacific and in the turbulent waters that had witnessed many shipwrecks throughout the centuries. Left behind in the lighthouse to guard it are three sailors, without knowing that in the island lie pirates with a plot to takeover the lighthouse in order to intentionally shipwreck the ships passing by and take over their treasures. A sailor escapes alive the seizure of the lighthouse by the pirates and a game of cat and mouse begins (if you seen Die Hard, you can imagine the plot, with the guard trying to hit back at the pirates). A great adventure book that you can read fast and easily."
3,Quick read,"I was looking for another Pirate book and found this one. Was an enjoyable ""quick"" read on the airplane. Not as good as Pirate Latitudes by Michael Crichton, but still worth the read."
4,works very well!,I love this sink stopper! It's very easy to use. I use it to fill my sink for cleaning beer bottles.
5,Flying High,Having been a lover of Superman films for years this adaption of the early years is one of the best. The characters are goodand the actors/ actresses excellent. Looking forward to a big time Movie version if it ever happens.
4,Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed Smallville because, first of all, Tom Welling is gooooooorgeous! But also because the scenarios in each of the episodes that the writers think up are quite entertaining and original. While the show itself is a bit dated, I don't think that draws away any of the apppeal that this show brings to young viewers such as myself. The more you watch this show the more addicted you will be!"
4,I can hardly wait....,"Let me start by saying that I've never watched an episode of Smallville on WB. I took a chance and bought season one last year on DVD and became hopelessly addicted to this show. Actually my entire family is addicted as we have been waiting for any sign of season 3's release so that we can fire up our weekly Smallville viewing parties. Season two ended like season one, with a frustratingly delightful cliffhanger and it's been difficult to resist turning on WB to catch a glimpse of season three. Yes, I'm cheating by rating this item without having seen it but judging from the excellent storytelling and the high quality DVD sets previously released in this series I expect great things."
3,Can get tiresome,"I just finished watching the fist 2 disks of season 3. The Lana/Clark relationship is annoying! All they do is appologize to each other, or look at each other with longing or blowing each other off. That is sickening. Either get together already or just stop this whole love routine for good! I can't wait for Louise Lain to come on the show. Lana Lang is boring and pointless. Clark Kent lacks the dynamic of the Superman. I hope the show improves with the next season."
3,great seller but wish the discription included the packaging type,"seller was great: prompt and easy to work with, but i wish that the description of the item had said that this was the old version of the series in the ""paper book"" format instead of the new oversize plastic flip case. I'm a collector and i prefer all my items in the same format."
4,Love the Show,"Love this show. Can't say much besides that. Smallville is an excellent series, so if you are a fan of the show, you will be a fan of the DVDs."
5,Great!,This was a gift for my husband. He watched seasons 1-7 in less than a month. Not to mention I found the best prices ever here on Amazon.
1,smallville season one,I clicking on this product because amazon won't review the product I had problems with. Make sure you watch their prices they are deceiving! And with the economy today it's amazing they do not care!
1,smallville,"Well the good thing is it came sooner then I thought, but the negative thing about it was it was all broke inside the case. The disc' were scratched up from the cases shattering. But besides all that I would rate it a 3 out of 10.(10 being the highest)"
1,Smallville season 3 order,This item was lost in shipping but Amazon had a replacement to my house with in two days! Great customer service speaks for itself.Thank you!Denise F.
4,Big Joe's Review,"I loved this season, It was sent very cheap and New. It was a great buy asnd I would reccommend it for anyone. Ready to buiy season 4 I guess."
3,Growing pains,"This is a quite good season plot-wise. My fav ep is RELIC but there are several good ones, esp. the cliffhanger. The only problem I have is the Clark/Lana angst every single episode. It's so thick you could cut it with an angst-cutting device and after 3 or 4 eps of exactly the same goo-goo eyed expression, it gets tedious, esp. since nothing ever comes of it. That's probably why Relic was such a relief. Even past-life romance was better than none at all."
5,It's too big to be called Smallville now.,"Season one made me excited. Season 2 brought together more character development. Season three was full of exciting things. It had better direction, editting, acting, and the story was more or less great. With the exception of the realization that kryptonite must be the most abundant source in Kansas, it was fantastic. Especially ""Covanent"" It makes me so excited to see what happens September 22nd in the Season 4 premiere. If you have seen the first two seasons, this is a must own. If you haven't, you should really invest in this show!"
5,TERRIFIC book for new dog owners and old ones too!,"I keep buying this book for myself and then giving it away to friends. I have taken a lot of classes and read more that a few books on dog training and learning theory. Friends and acquaintances, who are aware of my obsession, often ask me dog behavior and training questions. I finally have a book I can recommend that is easily understood by the average dog owner and yet really delves seriously into cutting edge theory and practical everyday issues.If you only have one dog book, this should be it!"
5,A wonderful resource,"This book is a great read for anyone who is interested in maintaining a trusting relationship with your dog while providing the structure and boundaries required. It is very readable, with good humor, and the recommendations very doable for anyone who owns a dog. The dogs will be grateful if you read this book."
2,"Damon Medic's review of ""Magic in the Water""","Damon Medic believes that this may be one of the worst movies ever made. It begins with a little girl placing Oreo Cookies at the end of a pier. She goes to see the cookies in the morning, and the cream centers are missing. The girl exclaims, ""I knew it!"" The movie goes downhill from there. I truly believe that the producers ran out of time, and were told to ""just put it out anyway."" The loose ends in this film are numerous. If you want to see one ridiculous film, perhaps the worst ever, buy this movie! You won't be disappointed with regards to the low expectations. It fulfills them all!Damon Medic"
2,Routine Child and Mysterious Sea Creature Movie,"It seems that underwater mysterious sea or lake creatures that are friendly to the one little girl or boy who believe it them have been in vogue for a few years. This is just another one of the same basic story, with nothing particularly innovative or new. Therefore, this is just another average such movie. However, I am grading it down a full grade because of the utterly unnecessary use of swear words, not by the adults, but by the kids as well. It isn't often, but there is no excuse for such language in what purports to be a family movie. Also, in one instance Ashley suggests that one of the young boys has been ""playing with himself."" Why is that in a supposed family movie? Finally, the psychiatric group seemed a bit too corny for me or for my grandson who watched it with me.Mee-Shee isn't completely free of bad language, but I think it is a better move all around than this one.."
4,Loch Ness Monster collection!,"It's just right! for my Loch Ness Monster collection! If you enjoyed E.T., Harry and the Henderson and Casper then this one you're looking for! I called this another ""Free Willy"" family feature film."
2,Just hope you never have service,"I sent my unit to Funai (support for Emerson) two months ago. I still have not received it back. Someone was supposed to call to let me know the status. Has not happened. Unit was great when it worked,but it stopped keeping time. Buy if you are sure you will never need service."
1,not best one out there....,"i hated it. i even returned it and bought a Toshiba DVD recorder. with one of theirs, you can make discs that play anywhere. This one, i never found a way. so that's why i say, don't buy this recorder, Toshiba is a good way to go.and later, when i went o emerson's website to look at it there(maybe i missed something) i couldn't find ANY dvd recorders. so i'm not sure if they'll help you there."
4,Excellent Historical Overview,Professors Black and Whitney provide an excellent overview of the early development of the various media outlets. Chapters are devoted to various media delivery systems. The book is easy to read and clearly documented. Since it is largely historical in nature most of its content is still valid. Illustrations add to its effectiveness.I have used this book in courses I've taught and have found it to be a good choice for introductory classes. Chapter summaries aid in focusing on the key points. I recommend the book for anyone interested in knowing more about the evolution of media and its audiences.
4,Good Fog Lights,"I purchased a set of Hella Optilux Model 1250. I did have some problems at first with one of the lights being white and not yellow but I got a hold of Hella and they made it right. Sent me a whole new kit and both of these lights are yellow. I made them aware that there was a problem because the guy I talked to was seeing an issue with them at there own warehouse. Once I got the yellow lights, they were good to go. They are nice looking and work well. Very pleased with the lights and their customer service. May just want to take a look at them before you install them to make sure that you have yellow ones. If you don't, E-mail the company and they will take care of you."
3,fog lights,they shine yellow i didnt rally care for that and the seals arnt the greatest but there ok foglights. thy was suposed to be hid bulbs and there not that bright.
3,What the hack...,"If for the book or the author's knowledge per se, I will give it a five star (probably 7 stars). However, for the usefulness, I can only give 3 (probably 2, but it's too cruel..). IMHO, if VB becomes too complicated (as it already did), it betrays its 'basic' origin and its RAD name. And it seems that some people think it's not complicated enough, so they like to hack... sigh. Maybe it's one reason that these days so many great scripting languages appear (e.g., python, etc) and many programmers (new or old) converted to the new stuff. Sometimes I think I should stick to C/C++ and get deeper into it and don't waste my time to other languages. If one could spend time to hack in VB, why don't one just program some specific parts in C++?? That's really what I did. I started to learn VC++ (and ATL) more. (Hack, no MFC anyway...)"
2,What a disappointment!,"This book came to me so highly recommended by people I truly respect, but as a developer whose job it is to deliver software solutions on time and within budget, it's hardly useful at all.The folks who touted this book so highly to me are all C programmers who seem to view VB as a necessary evil for occasional RAD projects, but I'm not in that school of thought.The real title of this book should have been ""How to Trick VB into behaving more like C by writing code that's just as excruciating."" Sure, you can do that, but then you miss the main advantage of VB over C, namely the capability to deliver maintainable software to your client in a fraction of the time (and cost) it would take for some oh-so-perfect system to be written in C.Save this for the super hard-core projects that can't be handled any other way. And while you're at it, if you're going to keep things so complicated, you might as well just write in C."
3,I agree with dragon999,"Strips VB of its RAD importance. I found that way of teaching not to be the best one. I wanna learn and be able to do things, not to use the Author's VBoost objects. I learn to build the object itself so I can change it later when VB changes. Felt like advanced C/C++ book. As I read further I started seeing less immediate practical application for my personal use. However, the advanced information on the book is priceless and can't be found anywhere else; I will probably go back to the book after I read other advanced VB books with things I can immediately apply when developping, say, a database application. Very good info though."
1,Whereis the CD,"Yes, I didn't read very carefully -- this is just the book, no CD. No idea of the source of this stupidity. Nor do a see a lower price."
5,"""CANDLELIGHT"" GLOWS OF LOVE","Like so many miniscule fires in the night, the exciting yet subtle piano stylings of Verne Langdon, who has earned the mantle ""Poet of the Piano"", serve as almost nondescript, yet at the same time deeply romantic, Grande Steinway background music, for conversation or romance. Much the same way that the perfect film score supports but never intrudes, so Verne Langdon etches his crystals of music to form intimate enjoyment by the discriminating connoisseur. A dozen select pieces include top (impromptu!) compositions ""Candlelight"", ""By A Winding Stair"", ""Sandalwood"", ""Remembering My Dreams"", ""Setting Sail"", ""Forever's Bells"", and a truly picturesque ""Afternoons In Velvet Rooms"".This is the third CD by Langdon for Dejavu Record Company (his first two, ""Key Of Sea"" and ""Forever, In Time"", are equally simplistic yet richly constructed). ""Candlelight"" will burn lovingly, albeit forever, in your heart."
5,Hats off to Dr.Rabin for this marvelous book!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have read a number of immunology text books in my life but i have never read one as easily understood.I began reading friday evening and finished monday. the book is fascinating,well organized ,most interesting data and understandable!!!!!!!.This book is a must for everyone interested in how stress is related to illness and why each of us must develop coping mechanisms.Thank you for your efforts Dr. Rabin.You have made this world a better place with this knowledge."
1,COMPLETE waste of money,I ordered this for my son's birthday thinking it would be a made for TV movie. It is unwatchable. I cannot think how the positive reviewers came up with any of the comments they made. The guy is sitting there - says a few words about his old buddy Sharpe followed by a quick clip from the episode. My son was incredibly disappointed and now I have to shell out for the series anyway. Save your money and go straight to the collection. And curses on the idiot marketing guy who thought that releasing this was a good idea. I usually pass videos I don't care to keep on to the the library but unfortunately this doesn't even have enough value for that. I couldn't in conscience resell it-so it and my money go in the bin.
4,A very good book,"I expected the book to be good, but it was more interesting than I expected. It has stories from many different people who knew him personally. There are tons of great stories and varied points of view. It also introduced me to some great performers I hadn't heard before, like Ron Shock. In the book, Ron Shock's voice is my favorite."
2,"Frustrating, disrespectful read indeed","Terribly written, all over the place, and included TMI about things that really didn't need to be revealed to get a good biography on Bill Hicks (like hearing intimate details of sexual encounters, etc). I really wasn't looking for a smut book with pornographic minutia on Hicks. I wonder if they'd be able to get away with revealing some of this stuff while he was alive. You call yourself friends of Bill? It was much better hearing bill reveal those details through his genius act. All that being said, there was also a lot of great information about Bill included. Definitely could have been written better though."
3,With friends like these,Ok I understand this was closure for them but some of this I don't think we needed to know.. Begging for cocaine and wanting his girlfriend to put grey streaks in her hair cause he was into her mother really? Why do this to your friend? Not one of that loves Bill Hicks standup thought he was an angel but I really think if I do indeed.chose to believe these stories you should have kept them to yourself and not tarnish Bill because you have this internal anger at Bill because he didn't live up to what you thought he was in your own head when he died....
4,It *is* Brain Surgery!,"This band [...] -- awesome live, and smokin' in the studio. Yeah, they've got that ""garage band"" vibe goin' on, but dismiss them as bullsh*t revivalists at your own risk -- their raw rock riffage and sheer abandon and exuberance will tear a new hole in your tired skull. This particular album, ""Ragged But Right,"" is smokin' -- frighteningly good stuff, which oughta make idiotic scenesters like Kings Of Leon and the White Stripes head for the hills with their poseur tails between their sorry legs. Buy it!"
4,Good for undergrad courses,"This book was very helpful to me during the beggining of my graduate course of Statistics I. It does help with most of the basic stuff but it does not contains many good examples of ANOVAS, Latin Squares, Randomized Complete Block Design, Blocking and other advanced topics (It doesn't contains any exercises using Tukey, LSD, Dunnet etc). Anyway, it is still a good book and it's still a good buy."
5,GREAT CD!,"Great CD, not one bad song. I hope to find more just like this one. This is a hidden gem of rock music!"
5,The best cordless desktop,"I've wasted time with other, cheaper cordless desktops and I wish I would have sprung for the LX700 first. The mouse feels awesome and the keyboard offers great looks and outstanding functionality. Best of all, the wireless connections work flawlessly, including with advanced mouse functions. Errors on cheaper branded desktops proved maddening; I'm happy to report no such trouble with Logitech. Logitech's done it right."
1,Warning: Potential Fire Hazard!!,"Only have the LX700 for 10 days. Functionality would rate 4 stars, but big problem with recharging the mouse. The recharging was working until this morning. I noticed I forgot to place it in the cradle overnight, so I plopped it in this morning. After am hour, I had to use the PC, so I pick the mouse off the cradle and it was HOT, HOT, HOT! So was the charger base. I searched in Logitech's user forums and found others have had similar and even worse problems with their units [some with the MX series]. In one case, the batteries actually melted and warped the mouse. When I called Logitech, they asked me to try to exhange it with the retailer. Otherwise, they have to arrange a pickup and replacement. Darn! I really like this combo too!"
1,Horrible LX 700,"I must say, the keybaord is awesome. Nice and sleek, everythings feels as though it was placed perfectly, but there's one HUGE problem w/ the set all together. For every gamer or programmer out there the LX 700's mouse seriously blows. I first received my LX 700 thru Newegg.com, but the mouse was skipping with quick movements, so I called Logitech; they said it was a faulty mouse. I traded the set in, waited a week, got a new one. Paid a total of 11.50 in shipping and handling now, guess what? The mouse still has the same pos skipping. I found that the LX700 has 400 DPI. (These days, 800DPI is standard) So, what does this mean? It means that the mouse skips w/ any resolution above 1024x768. HORRIBLE. 1 OUTTA 5 RATING !"
1,I hate this cordless desktop,"Today the button work, then tomorrow they decide not to, I have updated the software and I still have the same problem on 2 PCs, also the feel is not like that of a corded mouse, I spent $69 and I am not pleased, they just better send me my rebate back or else, if any one knows of a better unit please let me know."
3,good product rebate is fake,"A nice rechargable mouse-single charge comes almost 2-4 weeks.Key board is okay, it would be better if there would have been lights to show CAPS lock on etc.,I sent the rebate, received back a post card saying I didn't send the sales receipt, When I called up, the CSR said, the sales date provided in data is wrong, so she is submitting back again which will take, 6-8 weeks again!!!"
3,Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 700,The keyboard keys are sometimes unresponsive. There time when thet are struck and nothing appears in the screen where one is typing. Have thought abour trying to return it but I probably cannot find the paper work.
1,What's the point of being wireless?,"I bought this wireless keyboard and mouse so that I can stay out of the radiation from the monitor. For the mouse to work properly, it has to be within 3 feet. After 4 feet, it's dead-even with almost fully charged batt(half an hour use after overnight charging). My old mouse has 6 feet wire, so What's the point of using wireless?I'd love to give five stars, but not for this one.So if you want to use it within 3 feet, go ahead. But if u need some distance, try something else."
2,"GOOD PRODUCT, TERRIBLE SHIPPING","I just received my keyboard and I'm very pleased with the product.Before I decided to buy it from Tiger Direct through AMAZON, I look for prices in different places and here was the best one,To save money I decided it to get standart shipping BIG MISTAKE!, Both websites never updated the tracking information as of today you track the order and it says that the item hasn't being shipped and it's allready working in my computer, two days after the purchase I contacted Tiger Direct and they told me that I will be receiving my package on monday august 8th (I purchased it on 7/25).I new that my package was send when I receive it in my from UPS at my front door(this was 8/3)"
1,whoever made this was borderline retarded,"This keyboard is for USB but the mouse is for PS/2 connect only. Laam-o! I read a many reviews about this being ""cutting edge"" and ""smart"" but it's dumb! PS/2? cmon gimme a beak! I'll never trust another reveiw, not even Tom's Hardware who odviously has Logitechs working with them!"
4,Very satisfied,"This is my second set of logitech wireless keyboard/mouse combo I've had (the first one handed down to my dad) and I'm very satisfied. I find the logitech input devices very comfortable and natural.Specifically about this set, I like how the wireless base also acts as a charger for the mouse. The keyboard multimedia buttons aren't quite as customizable as I want, but it's still pretty good."
4,Great Product!...Poor Delivery,"This is such a great combo. Thumbs up to Logitech for designing an efficient keyboard with just the right functions and ergonomics while keeping it aesthetically appealing. The only few complaints about the keyboard is the ability to change the function of the Audio Preset buttons. People have mentioned this earlier, and now that I have it, I understand why they say Logitech seemed to have forgotten about these buttons therefore I only gave it 4 stars.[...]"
3,unequal combo,"The keyboard is fantastic--a great improvement over previous models. The action is tight and it seems quite durable. I have no idea why Logitech decided to shrink the buttons, though--not thinking of people with disabilities, obvioulsy. All in all, though, it's a great keyboard.The Mouse, on the other hand, is horrendous. It's big, clumpy, and basically has terrible movement. I ended up getting the MX1000 a few weeks later. Logitech really cut corners with this mouse. Buy the keyboard alone and get a good mouse. Shame on Logitech."
2,"Great product, but rebate is a joke","The wireless mouse and keyboard have worked very well for the last two months. The product is sleek and works great. The mouse battery has worked for a week at a time. An overnight charging once or twice a week works fine.Having said that, do not buy this product because the warranty is a joke. I sent in everything the warranty card said for me to send in. Now, two months later, I receive an email stating that I didn't give them the UPC code. That is a lie. I included the invoice from Amazon, the UPC code, and the completed warranty card.I'm keeping the product because it is a good product, and it is such a hassle to return items bought online. I will never fall for the rebate trick again. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Review for Logitech Cordless Desktop LX 700,I use this mouse/keyboard for work and I have no complaints. the product arrived quickly and with no problems.
1,Don't Buy This!!!!,"Whoever says they like this product was obviously paid by Conair. This is the worst piece of junk I have ever wasted my money on. And how about the false claims that your you'll be hair-free for two weeks? How can this be possible since you are not removing hair at root...you are only sanding hair off. I have fine hair, and the next-day stubble was worse than shaving, plus my skin was raw. It is so loud you will need earplugs. It only works on large, flat parts of the leg, so you'll have to shave the rest anyway. The pads need replacing just about every time you use them, at like $7 each. You'd be better off buying a sander from your local home-improvement store and sanding your legs with it."
1,Not for fine hair,"I had high hopes for this hair removal device. However, the first time I tried it, I ended up with burns all over my legs. Amazingly, I wanted it to work so much that I tried it again being more careful. After an hour, I ended up with some hair removal on one lower leg. The third time I also spent a long time and didn't get anywhere. I got results on the thicker hair areas, but the fine hair never went away, regardless of length. I could never get anywhere smooth. And forget about the knees or ankle area - ouch!Essentially, it takes way too long for little results. Shaving only takes a couple of minutes."
1,Takes your skin off..... OUCH!!!,"Beware! This thing, even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure, as well as not keep it in one spot, it took the top layer of skin off! My poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work. Ow! I had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed. And what's worse, it didn't take out all the hair.... I could still see some hair here and there it missed, and I thought I got it all. I returned it immediately and got a refund on my money. Never again.... I'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead....."
2,Ack...didn't expect that!,"Well, it does remove hair, and it isn't painful when it's removing hair, but after that....yaaooowww.It may be b/c I have coarser hair, but I had to take a long time trying to remove my hair and when I was finished everything was fine, for about 5-10 minutes -sooner if you apply anything to your skin. Then it feels like you've got the worst sunburn you've ever had... even water burned me.Even so -because it was recommended to ""adjust"" to the product- I attempted this form of hair removal about five different times. Every time with the same result.Perhaps if you have fine hair, this is the product for you. Just, be careful."
4,"not too good on skin, great on foot calluses!","It was ok on my legs. First time I used it I must have used it for too long because my legs got bad friction burns. After that, it did a mediocre job on skin. But, I use it once a week to do both heels (one to two pads needed) and it clears away my calluses in no time! I have to buy a lot of pads but it beats using a callus file!! Way faster (<2 minutes) and easier."
2,Are rug burns painless?,"Not only does this product NOT remove hair, but it gave me a horrible rugburn-like rash. (Yes, I followed the directions carefully). It basically buffs your skin and leaves nasty dust all over the place but the hair doesn't go too far! Don't waste your money. I'd rather wax!!!"
1,Since when does sandpaper remove hair?,"I have tried just about every hair removal process known to woman and oh my god, this one is the absolute worst! Even after following the directions to the nth degree I ended up with raw legs! I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I spent over an hour trying to remove the hair from one calf and still didn't get it all. I changed the pad, thinking I had a bad pad. It still didn't work. This is definitely not the ultimate hair remover. In fact, it hardly removes hair at all. Don't waste your money on this expensive item."
5,GREAT HAIR AND SKIN,"I am impressed with this product. It removed every bit of hair from my legs, and my skin is soft, soft, soft! I definately recommend this product."
4,Conair Hair Removal System - HB1,"I bought the Conair Hair Remover a few weeks ago. I love it!! I have coarse, dark hair & it works for me. At first I had to use it as much as a razor, but now, not quite as often. It does take a little longer than shaving, but my legs are very smooth when I get done. You do have to make sure you keep moving it over your skin. If you press too hard & hold it in one place, you will get like a rug burn. It is a little difficult around boney areas, but if careful, it can be done. I bought this for my legs, so I still use the razor for my underarms."
4,Sensitive skin jump for joy,"This product is great! i have really thick dark coarse hair and very white sensitive leg skin. Red bumps from razor burn show up really bad. I HATED shaving my legs. It burned terribly and itched, and sometimes I even cried it hurt so bad and looked so terrible. This product buffs away all the dry dead skin and most of my hair. True, it does leave some stubble, but i just quickly go over my legs with a razor and it gets rid of that. The razor does NOT cause any irritation bcz all the dead skin is not there to get snagged by the razor. I have never been so happy with my legs in my life, and I have been shaving my legs since the 3rd grade (seriously). If you have sensitive skin I really really really recomend this product."
5,Thank goodness!!!!,"I purchased one of these hair removers about 2 weeks ago. The night I received it, I took it out of the box and used it. My legs have never felt so soft. It was completely painless except for a slight friction burn (handled with aloe gel). I have very thick hair which needs to be shaved daily. Using this product, I was able to go almost a week without shaving!!! Thank you Conair!!!!!"
1,"scaly, scaly legs!!!","I saw this on tv, and thought it would be perfect. I'm a big fan of the ""Hair Mitten"" and I thought this would be a bigger, better, faster version -- no way! Yes, my legs were smooth the first few hours, but it's been 2 weeks now, and the hair grew back just the same and I've shaved my legs a few times. Not to mention this machine tore my legs to shreds, making them the scaliest things you'd ever wish to see and/or feel. Did I mention the stinging when trying to apply some moisturizer, even DAYS later? Awful! very disappointed."
2,"Exfoliate yes, remove hair no.","I thought I was going to finally stop shaving when I purchased this machine. I purchased this product about 3 months ago. It doesn't remove hair. It removes dead skin nicely, but the hair remains. I still have to shave."
1,Ouch! Don't waste your money!,"I was not impressed with this,I would have rather had razor burn, then the burn that I got from this! Not to mention it doesnt take your hair off all the way. It SUCKS"
1,It Hurts!!,"This product does not work at all. It barely took off my hair but instead took off my skin!!! I had burns all over. It is a joke, do not waste your money!"
1,conair forget to test it b4 they started selling it :),I bought this for my wife and when we started using it we felt that may be conair just forget to test this :) it dont worked for us at all. i tested it almost 4 time but the same result. the bleds get weared out in just 1-2 use so be ready for huge after purchase expanses. I returnde this to target and got Remington EP1000 Women's Smooth & Silky Hair Removal System from amazon for 25$ and it works great Read my review for this if you are intrested.
2,"I hope you ladies are right...but alas, you weren't","I just purchased this ""leg sander"" based upon what was said in the reviews. The catch is that I'm a male competitive bodybuilder/fitness model and shaving just takes too damn long! Since I have tougher skin than most women, I'm expecting pretty good results after the initial period it takes the body to get used to something new. I'll edit my post after I try it out.OK, I've used it very infrequently because it really doesn't do much as far as hair removal goes, but talk about smooth legs! This thing exfoliates incredibly well. I'll stick to shaving every few days and exfoliate weekly with the sander."
2,Looks ideal but isn't,"I thought this would be the answer to my shaving woes. It wasn't. I have course hair and this unit is not intended for that. If you have fine hair, it will probably work great. It took too much time in one area for the hair to be completely removed thus creating a slight ""burning"" sensation in that area. Doesn't work well around knees and ankles. The hair grew back quickly so I found this to be no more convenient than just shaving."
5,Awesome Product!!!,"Finally, a hair remover that works! I have very sensitive skin and have always struggled with uncomfortable razor burn and unsightly red bumps after shaving. This product solved all my problems - it removes all the hair with zero discomfort!! The sanding action of the pad polishes your legs to a silky smooth finish you could never achieve with a razor. You also have the added convenience of being able to do this anywhere, without shaving cream or the tub. I highly recommend this product..."
2,Subpar at best,"This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal. Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair. The hair that is removed doesn't stay gone long. And it's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body. It will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product."
3,Active wear outfit,Bright orange and tight knit so looks like a cheer leader type of outfit.Top is a little short but does touch the top of the pants. Very cute for spring wear as too tight to wear a long sleeve shirt under it.
1,Bad tape quality and weak content. A waste of money...,Bad tape quality and weak content. A waste of money...
3,Bad quality materials,"The quality of the box and the impresion inside was poor.The remasterization is pasable, and we can get better quality sound that in the original. Only I'm afraid about de CD quality, I hope it will last more than the blody box."
4,Cuts like butter though fabric,"These are a great pair of scissors, but I am not sure how long they will last. They seemed much better when I first bought them-I've had them about a year and they don't seem to work as well. I would recommend them, if they can be sharpened."
2,"""barely worth it""","Unless you are seeking a much needed feminist sensibility against Morrison's abusive Tar Baby narrative, I wouldn't bother. The rest of it is vague, presumptuous, shockingly lacking in self-reflection and criticism. For the most part, her flirtations at clear, responsible thought all to easily descend into her typical scolding tirades! She insults everyone's intelligence by speaking as if she is getting after an errant five year old!"
1,Don't Buy This,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. It worked great the first time he used it. The second time it started malfunctioning a little. The third time he couldn't even get it to turn on (and yes, he made sure it wasn't a battery issue).I think it's a great concept but it needs a lot of work.I'm going to send it back to Bushnell and see if they will let me exchange it for a good pair of regular binoculars.I don't suggest buying it until they have an opportunity to take care of all the problems."
1,Cash for Trash,"The optics used in these binoculars are semi-sharp in the middle and blurry around the edges, the quality of the images lack contrast and the life of the camera can be measured in weeks. Avoid Bushnell products in general. The optical quality has been horrible in every pair of binocs I've ever purchased (though I did like one of their easy focusing systems). On one pair, the images didn't even line up and it's not worth the postage to have them returned."
4,one flaw,"I used the image view to take 17 really good pictures. However, holding the binoculars in my hand as I walked to the beach, somewhere along the way the on/off switch simply fell out! I returned it for full credit but I would rather have had another pair. They were not in stock."
2,not a very good camera,not a very good camera. difficult to hold and operate. will not zoom in or out. basically a point aim and shoot camera. must have very steady hands.
1,No Motion,"This product only takes still pictures. No motion, no AVI, no instant replay.Why does it cost more than products that do all of the above?"
4,Great Phone!,"After using a Nextel 7520 for 2 years, I was ready for an upgraded phone with a camera. The Pearl is so much smaller that I was skeptical it could really do everything I needed. It CAN! The display is larger and much sharper and better than the Palm Treo 750 I thought I wanted.I miss the built in GPS capability though. The keyboard works better than I expected for letters, but it's tedious sometimes to enter email addresses, names, web pages.I love having any kind of ringtone I want now. The camera is nice to have, but the quality is a bit grainy. The size and weight are truly wonderful."
2,"So far, so bad.","I will come right out and say it: I am a Nokia guy. But I could not wait for the Pearl to come out with Cingular.But after 4 days with my Pearl, I am missing my old Nokia 6230.Aside from the easy internet access and emails, I don't yet see any advantage with this Pearl. The greatest disappointment so far is the Bluetooth stupidity of this so called ""smart phone"". Nothing seems to work. I also miss the easier text capabilities of the 6230. (not to mention the 6230s video capturing features).Of course the Blackberry Pearl must be a better, smarter phone than the old Nokia I love... but I just don't see it yet.What can I say? I am very disappointed so far. If I don't see results by the end of tomorrow, it's going back to the guys at Cingular.Bummer."
3,Never Again,"I ordered from Amazon(the middle man) this Treo 750 and yes shipping was quick but then both times I ordered from Amazon, ""A1"" sent me defective phones. Both times I have to return the phone and cancel the service that went along with it. Too much hassle and inconvenience. Not even worth the price."
3,Porting fees,"A previous user stated that there is a $250 ""porting"" fee, and in effect, there is. If you order from AMZN, you DO save the phone cost BUT since it comes to you ""hot"" (that is with a pre-assigned Cingular number), when you go to port and change that number, Cingular will charge AMZN, who in turn, will bill you for $250. ""New"" to AMZN has what seems to be a very narrow definition, they mean (apparently) ""new"" to cell phones (unlikely).3 stars for AMZN not being as forthright as one might hope"
1,beware of fine print in amazon's cingular phone promotion,read the fine print!!!! amazon really tried to pull one over on you with this promotion. it happend to me.they don't allow you to port your cell phone to this phone without a $250 fee!!! how ridiculous! everyone ports numbers these days...it's such a common practice. this process doesn't hurt anyone - cingular still gets the business and amazon still gets their money. why they don't let you port - and it's hidden in the fine print...is beyond me.
1,Treo is Fine But Wirefly's Service Is Not,"I like the Treo and it serves it purpose (email, phone, PDA, etc.). For the phone, I give it 4 stars.However, my review will focus more on Wirefly's service. I purchased the Treo because of the $100 rebate from Wirefly. However, I am still waiting for Wirefly to send me my rebate form. I've been sending them emails asking about the status for months now. Each email was responded with ""we will expedite your request."" Finally, in one of their last emails to me, Wirefly stated that my rebate form was sent to me. It's been over two months since my purchase, and I am still waiting for the rebate form. Now, my follow-up emails go unresponded. I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice. Just be careful when ordering from Wirefly."
4,"I only got 100 pages in, but I shall sally forth again","This is a difficult poem. It's interesting how archaic Spenser's language seems, considering that he was a contemporary of the much more modern-sounding Shakespeare. Of course, there is a deliberately nostalgic tone to the ""Fairie Queene,"" which harkens back to an idealized medieval past. The influence of Middle English poetry -- particularly Chaucer and ""Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight"" -- is palpable.I shall try it again in time. The lushness of Spenser's language is at times delightful, and it's also illuminating to see the way pagan and Christian imagery vie for power in the narrative. The structure seems a bit rambling; compared to the precision of (for instance) ""Paradise Lost,"" ""The Fairie Queene"" requires rather more patience of the reader."
2,Disappointed,This book had a lot of good reviews so I bought it thinking it might demonstrate good methods of acrylic painting. It does show some techniques but not with enough detail. Given the chance again I would not buy this book.
5,learning new ways,I Just received this book and I am already using new techniques that I have found in it. Great book and reasonably priced.
3,Madonna single with great cover art,"Madonna at her most beautiful - great cover art.Song isn't her BEST song, but gotta love her."
4,"great product, wish rubbermaid sells parts separately","this set is super easy to put together, only took my husband 30min. and our closet looks so much better. the material is of good quality. we only wish that rubbermaid sell individual parts. we ended up w/ a few extra shelves, and wished that we could buy the support bars separately and then semi-organize another closet."
3,effective but hard to install,"This organizer is very effective when it comes to organizing your closet. However, the assembly isn't all that easy. I'm quite handy for a woman, and thought I could put this together without my husband's help. First thing first, this set is very heavy. Without even reading the cover, I tried to lift the box and almost broke my back. And eventhough there's no cutting of the metal involved, you still need to be able to measure and drill & use the hammer. I tried to do it myself, but at the end, my husband had to put it together because you need an extra hand to go this."
2,I'm no handyman-can't hang a shelf,"Wish more reviews like B's had such good installation description. I guess we should have known the location of studs in the closet before thinking of purchasing this unit. This turned out to be so wobbly and unstable we couldn't use it-the screws came out of the wall, the anchors very difficult to install, also came back out of the wall. It was very frustrating."
4,"Easy Config, and install","I bought one set several months ago, my wife love it so I bought another set for another room couple weeks ago . it comes with every things you need or maybe more than you need (tools not included), easy to install and setup. Very flexible to config, on the packing box, it also show you the possible way to configure for different width and heigh closet.Highly recommend this product"
2,Ordered new. Product arrived in busted box and bented shelves.,"I order a new closet kits. The product arrive looking very old, like it's been in storage for a while. The box was busted open on one side, couple shelves were bent.I wanted to send it back and order new one but they are out of stock. I don't know how long is the wait and I need my closet now. So, I guess I'm stuck with this."
4,Awesome shelving system but.....,"The Rubbermaid 3H88 closet system is everything it advertises...Easy to install, very durable and does allow for very clean, organized storage. Only downfall is that if you wanted to add on longer shelves like we needed, you will not find extra brackets and shelves anywhere making it not so expandable. I actually had to by extra parts from another shelf system that worked ok. Be sure to buy the biggest available system to maximize its utility. In the end, i believe you could build your own system with other individual pieces from a less expensive system and pay less for what you need. it's a good start though....before you buy, make sure it'll be enough for what you need and if it is, you'll definately like it........"
4,great product,We installed two of these systems in a rental home we own and the tenants love them. They are so versatile....and no cutting. Wow.
5,Quality+Price=Value,"I am very happy with my new Rubbermaid Configurations closet kit. It was very easy to install and is flexible to accommodate changing needs. Compared with other closet organizers, the Rubbermaid was a steal. The materials are quality and it feels very solid in my closet."
5,Insight to a legendary band...,"RUSH 101. Visions contains a wealth of information on Rush including details on how the trio finally came together, where they have been and effectively the motivations that signal where they may be going. The book covers up to the Hold Your Fire album. This is a must have for any Rush fan new or seasoned."
5,"The Rush ""Mission"" comes to life....a great book!","From start to finish, a great book and a must have for a Rush fan.I first read this book 8 years ago and it has never gotten old.I even did a book report on it when I was a freshman in High School and I made it a movie poster.The ultimate Rush book!"
1,Informative but poorly written,"""Visions"" is the only official biography of Rush, but it reads more like ""My Adventures With Rush"" than it does a serious biography. The information is clouded in writing that resembles that of a lucky fan more than a journalistic effort. The author is also known to write inflammatory comments to and about anyone who disagrees with his views, making it impossible for me to recommend this book. If you feel you must read it, you might be better off borrowing a copy of it."
1,A Rush Book Report,"The poor written quality of this work does no justice to the rare musical talents of the band members. The terms sophomoric and sychophantic characterize Banasiewitz' irrelevant ride on the groupie train. The best thing I can say about the book is that in the absence of a more comprehensive and professional work by the band members themselves (please!) it does fill a void. Of course, tossing 'Visions' into an empty trash can will accomplish the same thing."
2,Overrated.,"I was prepared to write something much better, as I expected a wonderfully written book. However, in final analysis, I find that this book is more in the vein of the author's gloating about the level of his dedication to the Canadian rock group Rush. As a fan of that band as well, frankly, I was quite embarrassed to find that the ""best"" biography of the band was this story. At times it's quite interesting, with many vignettes; however, after a while it becomes tiring, along with the constant sly references to the band's lyrics. My only recommendation is that you buy it only if you have to, because I have read some of the author's other work, and it lacks a lot of discipline and loses the reader rather quickly."
2,"Good Book, Terrible Writer","I can give B-man credit for one thing: he did his homework when it came to Rush. Other than that, it's a typical biography of a great band. Nothing amazingly revealing. In the end it amounts to junk. B-Man is an odd little sod in his own right. Bottom line: sublimely lame book filled with nothing of any major interest, unless your only knowlidge of Rush was listening to ""Tom Sawyer"" on the radio wondering ""who the hell is that chick that's singing?"" And by the way, Cary Hall made my other point. So read his post as well."
1,MAD AT MYSELF....FOR BUYING THIS,"I Don't know what Martin Donovan was hoping to achieve in this visually stunning but emotionally empty piece of garbage. There's so little dialogue that when it comes, you expect something revealing? Forget it...Mary Stuart Masterson, Fionnula Flannagan and Hart Bochner are totally ineffectual, and the plot is so stupid and threadbare, one has to wonder who put up the money for this one!DO NOT BUY...DO NOT RENT......A WASTE ALL AROUND!"
5,A story as elevating as the Mountains,"Maggie's book is by far the most soul touching book I have read all year. With amazing grace , she transports the reader to Nepal to share in her awe of the ancient beauty and respect for this mystical land and its people. Through her candlelight journal entries, the reader can easily visualize the colorful saris, feel her frustration when lost on a mountain path for hours, hear the sing-song cadence of her Nepalese friends, delight in her discovery of a tube of Crest toothpaste, her gratitude for tea and rice supper. The very human and honest account of her Peace Corps experiences only leaves the reader wanting more...for one must know there is much more to be told."
4,O2 sensor for 2002 s80,Product worked just fine. My only complaint was that the cable was shorter than the original so couldn't use the installation clips to hold it in place like the original. Connectors fit together perfectly. This was a replacement for the up front o2 sensor and I installed from the top of the car. Dealer wanted several hundred for install to replace from bottom which would have required removal of Catalytic converter etc.
3,"Lights good, wires barely adequate","Lights themselves are well made and bright. Before I hooked the lights up to my truck I ran a bench test on them, including using the enclosed switch. After 50 minutes the lights were performing fine but the lead wires were warm (not hot, which means the gauge is barely adequate). The on/off switch was smoking hot, though. My advice: if you buy the lights use better wiring and by all means get a better switch."
3,Hella Optilux?? Bastard child of Hella I guess,Purchased these lights recently. They are sold as Hella lights but the chinese Optilux packaging was indication that Hella did not want to put their names on these budget priced (and budget quality) lights.Mine came with the added bonus of factory fitted crack from the edge to the center of one lens. The wire harness and relay are adequate though the switch is not worth the $0.05 the guy who built it was paid. Light output is ok but not worth your trouble installing in anything valuable (like a car). I purchased mine for a dozer but I am sure the cracked lens will fall our with any vibration. The lens is bonded into the metal body so you wont be able to replace it.These might be worth the $40 they retail for - but I would not say much more.
1,"Poor construction, no manufcaturer back up","These lights ""appear"" well made at first. But after they got wet, internal condensation started after a light rain. Amazon replaced the first set without a problem. However, the second set does exactly the same. Careful review shows that the lens is not sealed all the way around. I contact Hella (who owns the Optilux brand) and they say the opening in the lens seal where the humidity enter ""...is designed to be that way"". Go figure - allow humidity in? This reflector will rust over time with that condensation.These are very cheap Chinese made with the Hella brand on them and obviously no QA from Hella.I am returning the second set for a refund and looking at other brands."
1,D.O.A,broken lens cant even try if it's good or badit was packed very poorlyi'm very disappointedi wonder if any body had the same problem
2,Very Disappointing,"Being an avid admirer of Manet and of the paintings in which Victorine Meurent appeared, I was happy to see a book about her. Finally, I would be able to learn something of her and her life! I learned that she was a Lesbian and died in 1927 and not as a destitute alcoholic as written in some rather sketchy histories of her. but that is all I learned. The book is actually more about the author and her trying to make peace with her past and her mother than anything else. If you want to learn about Victorine, you must find another book. If you want to know about Eunice Lipton, this is the book for you. Also very few facts in the book; the author puts Victorine in some situations and conversations, but these are all imaginary. Definitely would not recommend. Author was self-indulgent and apparently not very concerned with her subject."
2,Dissapointing,"Lipton seems reluctant to deal with the facts she can recover. Instead, she prefers to create a fiction which is more of a projection of her own neurosis than anything which is supported by her sources. All the primary sources agree that Victorine Meurent was a destitute alcoholic for some time before she dies, but Lipton prefers to imagine her as a proto-feminist heroine. She seems so blinded by her own prejudice that she can only lash out at anyone who presents her with information which paints Victorine in less than favorable colors. For a more balanced view of the same material, find a copy of Otto Freiderich's Olympia: Manet and the Paris of his Times."
1,Is this supposed to be scholarship?,"'Well, I'm a redhead now, and people are saying, ""You know, you look like Victorine.""'Perhaps I do.'Oh please. Elsewhere Lipton slips into the 'voice' of the model Victorine Meurant and seems to allege that she was an undiscovered or overlooked genius -- this in a time when such female artists as Suzanne Valadon, Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot achieved reasonable, lasting success.But most of the book is autobiography, telling Lipton's side of her first divorce or how she was unjustly fired from Hunter College, and so on.It's dreadful."
4,Compelling Case that they really did discover Mt Sinai,"This page-turner demolishes the traditional view of the location & route of Exodus and gives us a high-probability route & location.That these guys were motivated by treasure hunting and not by an emotional need to ""prove"" Scripture reliable, adds to their credibility.Also agree that the Clancy-esque overlay is unnecessary."
4,"Interesting,informative, a good read.","Howard Blum's account of events which occurred in the late eighties provides the backdrop of his new book, ""The Gold of the Exodus."" In parts, it reads like a thriller, better than most, actually. But in other parts it lags. That's pardonable, though, given its overall fast-paced delivery. The question, was it convincing? is where I had some problems. Yes, it did seem that his protagonists stumbled onto something historic, but did he make that case in the book? Inferentially, yes. Factually, I think not. And that's why this thoroughly enjoyable book gets an 8 from this reviewer."
3,"Entertaining ""Indiana Jones"" style adventure...","Blum's dramatization of Williams and Cornuke's ""rediscovery"" of evidence for a non-traditional location of biblical Mt. Sinai. The discoveries point to Jebel al Lawz in Saudi Arabia rather than the traditional Jebel Musa in the Sinai peninsula as being the mountain where the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by God. Actually, Ron Wyatt was the first to document the same evidence in the 70s and 80s so there are no new revelations or great discoveries revealed in this book."
1,Fiction told as History that comes across as Fiction !!!!!,"As a devotee of biblical history and myths, I was excited to receive my copy of The Gold of Exodus. I have trecked in the Sinai and been to Jabal Mousa, the mountain venerated as Mt. Sinai in the Sinai. So this new theory was of great interest to me.Unfortunately, the data presented is not corroborated by a single source. It is presented in a most unplausable and bizarre tale purported to be true.If there was truth here, why has no one sought to follow-up? Why has nothing appeared in the literature to sustain and further evaluate the claims made in this book? I don't know the answer but it must call into question the hypothises presented and the details surrounding the adventure that uncovered it.By the way, no one ever mentions that a translation of Jabal al Lawz could be ""Mountain of-Laws."" Do you really think that this cast of characters was the first to discover that this mountain could really be the true Mt. Sinai? I don't think so."
3,Could it be all true?,The story this book tells is incredible. What if they have really found the true Mt. Sinai? This is almost too incredible to believe. The text does dwell on a few conspiratorial theories that the Israelis and Arabic secret service is out to get the heroes of the book though. This detracts from the story of discovering the true mountain of God. Also the pictures in the book are interesting but it appears if they were taken at noon day. The ascent and following descent of the mountain took place during the night and early dawn. Maybe it gets light really quick in Saudi Arabia. Overall the book was easy to read and enjoyable and would recommend it to others. I just wish the author had documented the sources he used to a greater extent.
1,Unbelievable even if (properly) labeled as fiction,"I do a lot of driving and consequently listen to a lot of books on tape. I never like to listen to tapes of books that I'd actually like to read, thus ""The Gold of Exodus."" Actually, I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit to have actually listened to it. Don't make the same mistake, and certainly don't bother reading the print version. The ever-present annoyance of this book is that it is passed off as non-fiction. If it were properly labeled a novel, it would rate as a c-grade adventure story. Not entirely unentertaining, but cheap and strained in the credibility department. But as a supposed ""true story,"" almost every word of this book is an insult to the reader's (listener's) credulity. It is utter, total hogwash, and that's hard to get beyond. This ""gold"" should be left buried."
1,A Muslim perspective,"All the biblical fundamentalists reviewers here don't get the irony that Blum's alleged adventure only backs up Muslim claims. If God did indeed reveal the Torah in Arabia, it should come as no surprise that He followed up with the revelation of the Koran only a few miles to the south many centuries later. In any event, as a Muslim, I would be delighted to discover that the true Mount Sinai is in Arabia. However, the lack of geological accuracy in this account suggests that this particular discovery is inaccurate. If not, I hope the Saudis waste no time to declare that God's mountain is smack in the middle of Islam's home."
2,"Oh, Please!","While reading this book, I was reminded of a couple of boys telling how they sneaked over a fence to partake of forbidden fruit. ""Boys"" is the operative term. What a bunch of amateurs!"
2,A Full Blown Hoax!,"Let me get this straight.. two guys in their 40's, one with ""blown out knees"" and a badly strained back, ascend and descend an 8000ft high mountain in the black of night, in SIX hours. Wow!That's after they pass through Saudi Arabian Customs with a metal detector, night-vision goggles and at least one large knife.. all because of knowledge gained from the proven con artist and so-called ""Discoverer"" of Noah's Ark.. Ron Wyatt. Wow!Mr. Blum fleshes out his 30 or so pages detailing the expedition with some fanciful insights into the Saudi defence system, all worthy of Tom Clancy, and entirely irrelevent to the main story. A few black and white pictures are inserted.. sure is interesting what a mountain top looks like at night.. one could almost swear the pix were taken well after dawn.. but then, that's impossible because the photographer had returned to camp. Wow!Run.. don't walk, away from this sorry tale."
4,Did they or didn't they?,"I thought it was a fun book to read, and very intriguing. Yet it forces one to make a judgement as to whether or not it really happened they way they wrote it or it is just a good story. But assuming it all really happened, I do not know what is more disturbing, that Mt. Sinai is real and in Saudi, or that it is that easy to break into Saudi strategic military installations..."
1,"Creative fantasy, yet most improbable.","Ironically, I read this fictional work while serving as an Army intelligence officer here in Saudi Arabia. I must say that the author was exceptionally creative, but not at all realistic in his portrayal of anyone's ability to enter and operate within the borders of KSA. As an intelligence specialist here, I was very amused by the tale described, but hope that readers actually believe what they have read."
2,Starts off interesting but then.....,"I'll admit- I only listened to the audio version of this book. It starts off with some international intrigue but by the time our two amateur adventurers are in Saudi Arabia it begans to sound like Ishtar II. The narrator didn't help much, with his contrived, caricature accents, and gee-whiz personifications of our two main characters. The book is probably better than the tape (which was abridged) but the tape didn't make me want to go back and read the book for the full account (and I love books along this theme!)."
2,After Larry Williams' original book... this is fiction!,"This book must be categorized as historical fiction. The details of the Saudi Arabian site are filled with half truths. Having read the book, ""The Mountain of Moses"", by Larry Williams and Bob Cornuke, the details are completely different. Finally, having seen video footage, filmed by a close friend, the military issue is a total fabrication. This book will, however, let the world know of a Biblical site that has been hidden since the 3rd or 4th century."
4,An Indiana Jones Type of Adventure,"The Gold of Exodus is about the archeological adventures of two men, Larry Williams and Bob Cornuke who believe that Mount Sinai is not in the Sinai Peninsula as many scholars have thought, but in northwestern Saudi Arabia. The real Mount Sinai is a mountain known as Jabal al Lawz and is now a top secret Saudi military base. The two men make some interesting discoveries and whether you believe their theories or not, The Gold of Exodux was a book I couldn't put down. There are many things in this world that are not what we think they are and it is best to keep an open mind. I won't give away any more details as I truly hate it when reviewers tell so much about the books that there is no reason to read them."
1,wrong info,This Kindle item is not Niven book Flatlander but only a short story of the same name. Don't be fooled; although this claims to be 368 pages it is really about 30 pages. I complained to Amazon about the misleading info but they will not do anything .
3,Short Changed,"I bought the kindle version and to my surprise it was not the book I had read years ago. I estimate the kindle version is only 50 pages long, vs 350+ as advertised. What happened to the rest of the book?? I hope Amazon corrects this problem.I gave it 3 stars because what I have of the story was a good story, so if you don't mind getting short changed then buy it, otherwise let's hope the rest of the book will make it to the kindle."
2,No Table of Contents? Really?,"Not sure about the previous reviewer who said he only got one short story when he bought this for his Kindle. I received the same 300+ page collection I have in paperback. But what I did not appreciate was reading it through, reaching the novella ""Patchwork Girl,"" deciding I wanted to skip to the next short story, only to discover THERE IS NO TABLE OF CONTENTS. In a novel maybe you can get away with this. But in a collection of short stories and novellas it is unacceptable. I would expect this from a public domain release, not from a commercial one."
4,This kindle book contains five short stories,"I just bought this Kindle book and it includes the five expected storiesDeath by Ecstasy (formerly The Organleggers),The Defenseless Dead,ARM,The Patchwork Girl,The Woman in Del Rey Crater.No table of contents.Search for the five titles and bookmark them."
4,Keeps You Guessing,"This was given to me as a Christmas gift and I let it sit on the shelf collecting dust for far too long. I came onto this in my pre-Kindle part of the year when I was looking for a small paperback to cram into the subway with me. This is a collection of short stories about Gil ""the Arm"" Anderson, a future detective with a psychic third arm. Quite hard-boiled in its own way and Niven is one of the masters of science fiction. Hard sci-fi normally isn't my genre, but he keeps the mysteries so fluid and dynamic that none of the stories in the collection is a dud, which I find to be a rare occurrence."
4,Very Good SF,"""Flatlander"" is a collection of short stories about Gil Hamilton, a detective who lives in our future. Yep, it is darn hard to find good SF mystery stories and Niven does a very good job here. Some of the hard SF gimmicks are really good!I enjoyed reading it. I suggest that you buy it."
4,"Good book, but mistake ridden","I am slowly replacing my physical library, and this was one of the first books replaced. It matched my physical copy, but... I was very annoyed with the large number of spelling and formatting errors. For example, in one story, ""needler"" ( as a weapon ) got transliterated as ""needier"" every time. Bloody annoying!!I would like to know how Amazon goes about fixing such errors, and then getting them out to the people who purchased the books in the first place."
1,"Only the Beowulf Schaefer short, *Not* the real book","This is not the book, even though Amazon claims it to be (the cover, page count, etc)It is a cool, yet very short, story, but not a full eBook."
3,Good Quality Vacuum,"I was is need of a new vacuum. My husband bought this one for me as a surprise. I love the way it works and that I do not have to buy any more bags!!! Also, I can see what it is picking up...yuk, but I know it is working! The problems I have with it are the weight of it...very heavy, but it does have caster wheels in the rear so it maneuvers well. Also, the noise...it is very loud!!! I like to vacuum when my little ones are napping, but the noise makes it impossible!"
3,"Powerful, but...","We're pleased for the most part with the 088300. The power is good; it cleans up all the pet hair nicely. However, when using the upholstery tool, the vacuum itself still runs. Today while cleaning the couch, I had it sitting on a throw rug. Enough of the rug got sucked up into the vacuum to cause the roller to get stuck, and the belt overheated and broke. Now I'm surfing the net for a replacement."
3,not my clear trac :-(,"I've had the same vaccum for over ten years but the company that made it is not manufacturing any more so i tried this Dirt Devil because it was a good price and had the features I wanted. It is put together well-esp the see thru dirt cup in the front-many other models dirt cups were loose in the store. The turbo tool is handy but the floor adjustment does not work well. there are spots for inbetween settings but it really only changes on the floor and high pile setting. Thus i don't feel like it is close enough to my floor to clean it well. I'm used to a vaccum that suctions to my rug, not runs over the top of it. My biggest complaint is: it is REALLY LOUD! I'm thinking of returning it because I'm afraid i'll go deaf if i continue to use it!"
1,The worse vaccuum ever!,"I have had this DirtDevil model for nine months and it has been awful! It just does not justify it's money. Firstly it clogged up-and it does this a lot believe me. It is such an hassle unscrewing and cleaning the pipes. Secondly, it overheats and you can smell burning. Thirdly, the belt has snapped twice.Even when everything works the performance is NOT great! I even contacted DirtDevil several times for advice and even they admitted it was best for light use and was prone to clogging.Lastly our DirtDevil has finally given up and died today, after just nine months, twenty uses and countless problems.Basically DO NOT BUY this cleaner! Personally, I will never buy a DirtDevil product ever again."
1,"After two carpet cleanings, brush stopped working","This vaccum seemed well designed from outside with all its tools and style. I bought it at BestBuy and it came with a free handvac and extra Hepa filter. However, just after two carpet vacuums, the rotator brush stopped working. Ever since, the vacuum just didn't pickup any hair from the carpet. Returned it to the store.Don't waste your money on this. Appearances are deceptive. This vaccum is not worth your time and money."
1,Junk,"This Vacuum Sucks, and so does Dirt Devil Customer Service, as well as Target's Customer Reps at the Meadowbrook Mall in Bridgeport, WV. Want a good Vacuum, don't buy this model, it is loud, poorly engineered, and does not come with a 3 year warranty as advertised. I guess the word warranty is translated differently in the country where these were built. Target doesn't care if you spend $120 for a sweeper that lasts only four months. Dirt Devel is the rudest company I have ever dealt with and Target could care less. Before you give this vacuum a good rating, use it for six months if yours last that long. Oh, about Target's 90 Day return policy, well, if a product will last 91 days then it's no problem, for them. It's your problem."
2,Sounds like a Jet Engine Taking off,"I bought this vacuum less than a year ago. I am most disappointed in how EXTREMELY loud this machine. Perhaps the dirt devil people should include a set of ear plugs for each family member with purchase. In addition to the jet engine sound it creates, the machine is pretty heavy, the hose seem to pop off several times per use, and recently the belt broke. I'm only using the vacuum for my upstairs (three bedrooms and a hallway) so it's not like I'm asking a lot from this machine! Overall, I'm really disappointed."
2,Do not waste your $ or time,I bought this vacuum after having several vacuums in the last 9 years. Nothing every seems to hold up very long. I picked this one because I liked the on board tools that it came with and the price. What a big mistake. I put it together which took about 20 to 30 mins. Turned it on and vacuumed the house. Didn't seem all that great took the hose out to do the furniture and all the dog hair and stuff that was on the floor was stuck in the hose. The hose would not suck anything up. After I was done I realized that it was just blowing the dog hair and dust all over the house. I had to clean my whole kitchen and dust all my tables. I just hope Target will return it after putting it together and useing it. Do not waste you money or time with this.
1,Vacuum sucks up belts!,"I returned the vacuum within 5 days of purchase. Tried using the vacuum a few times and went through 4 belts!!!! No joke! I called the company and was instructed to bring it to the service department (which was a 30 minute ride away) and IF it was covered under warranty, it will be fixed. Instead, rolled it into the store where I purchased it from and got a full refund. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VACUUM!"
1,Possible Design Flaw,"I used this machine one time and the belt broke! This was due to the spindle that spins the roller belt gets so hot (and stays hot) it actually melted the belt after shutting off the vacuum! The second time I used the vacuum, I noticed it wasn't picking up anything, and the roller brush wasn't spinning. Upon removing the bottom plate, I discovered the problem with the belt. If Dirt Devil gets there act together and fixes this problem, it is actually a very good machine. But the problem with the overheated spindle burning the drive belt, makes this product unusable!"
2,its ok,"Well, I JUST got it today, I had an older model of dirt devil which was a bit heavier which I liked because I felt I had more control over than this one, the flimsy small wheels on the bottom are difficult to navigate on carpet making it feel like your not in control and it is quite loud, There is a slight smell while/after vacuuming as if the motor is burning up already after 1 small trial run, but I'll find out about that hopefully within a few weeks, the verdict is still out with this particular model, I paid 119.99, but paid like 1/2 the price for the dirt devil before this one and so far feel more comfortable with THAT model. My mother in law purchased a whirlwind Eureka and said it rocks, but I was hesitant since my last Eureka's motor burned out the 1st month of use! (which is why Im a dirt devil fan now, our DD lasted for about 5 years + now!)I'll let you know in a few months! :)"
1,this thing is a pile of garbage because it's too powerful,"My wife bought this for pet hair. It works really well if you don't mind replacing the belt every time you use it. There is so much power that if anything: corners of rugs, a sock, a pantleg, rug fringe gets caught in the roller it snaps the belt.It is supposed to have an auto shutoff if this happens, but it doesn't. We have had it for 3 months and have replaced the belt everytime we have used it. I am not exaggerating. I'm writing this now because it just happened again and I didn't want it to happen to you."
2,Not to happy,"When the belt isn't broken the machine works wonderful, however I have gone through 3 belts and owned it less than a month. Went with it because of the brand name of Dirt Devil but I don't think that I would buy one again."
2,NEED EARPLUGS!,"I bought this vacuum because I was interest in a bagless and it had a reasonable price. It does an ok job on picking up dirt, although my old Hoover worked better. The hose always comes out when I'm using it and I am constantly replacing it (it doesn't suck without the hose being returned to its place). The worst thing about it is its really LOUD!! I'm afraid my 2 year old will go deaf. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum."
3,i also took karens advice and used a swiffer to clear bug clogs,thank you so much Karen!! we have had our machine for about 8 months with few issues but today no suction at allthrough the hose so we knew it was the hose. I went on google and asked for help and there was her review with her reference to several clogs. I quickly took her advice to use the swiffer hndle and yes it worked like a charm. Once again thanks so much!!
2,Wouldn't Recommend,"I purchased this set of spoons because they are narrow and can fit into any number of spice jars. I also wanted them because they are hinged and nest inside of each other & take up little space. After first use, the pin fell out and the spoons became unhinged. I tried to reassemble and the pin keeps falling out - wouldn't recommend."
5,A Definitive Work,"A well argued book on the subject of man's beginnings. The book explains the extreme complexity of life and the dependence of the various systems on each other. He discusses relevant scientific issues that deal with the origins of life, such as overcoming the entropic forces of nature which prevent order from arising out of chaos. This is the first book I ever read on the subject and have recommended this book to many people.I read the other review on the book and the writer makes a ludicrous, broad sweeping statement as a point of criticism of the book as follows:""He failed to make me see this, due to Christianity's many internal contradictions and its failure to correlate with scientifically observable reality. A worthwhile contribution to the debate on Christianity's relevance to the real world.""The book is one of the bests on the topic."
4,"Catchy songs, puts you in a reflective mood","The first three songs on this EP, Silence, Complex, and Sonata are good enough to buy this cd alone. They are 6 - 9 minutes long and build into incredibly beautiful songs. Apache is a good remix, if you liked the original, Pop Corn is also a fun remix, but the title track and track 8 which should be labeled Silence (vision 3) builds off the beginning track's melody effortlessly. Half the EP is superb, and judging by the standards based on music that has been released these days, that is excellent."
2,"Was a great reference, but getting outdated","While this book was the ""breeder's Bible"" when it was first published 25 years ago, the fact is that genetics, especially equine genetics, has progressed by leaps and bounds since then. Many things we thought to be true then are no longer so. I think this is a great book to have in your library; some things about it are timeless. However, if you're looking to answer specific genetic questions (For example, ""How do I get an Overo?""), then you may end up with wrong information. Anyone using it to answer these questions would do well to double-check it with another, more recent textbook, such as ""The Genetics of the Horse."""
2,Horrible stovetop cookware,I have several visions pieces. I only keep them because they are handy to use in the microwave; on the stove the only thing they are good for is boiling water. They heat VERY unevenly and develop terrible hotspots. If you drop them or the lid you stand a fair chance of shattering it. The fact that they are transparent has never been useful to me.
3,Quick takes,"This is supposed to be a movie, but the cutting (or is it the story?) makes it seem like a video, the kind where You can't always follow the logic. Or maybe I should use the analogy of comic strips? There are other films about bike messengers I have seen that gives more of a feel of the work. There are other films about people at the stock exchange I have seen that gives more of a feel of the work. This one just slips in between the two. It's not a bad movie. It's just ordinary."
3,San Francisco in the 1980s,"I'm a big fan of Kevin Bacon and a big fan of San Francisco set movies but ""Quicksilver"", released in 1986, doesn't hold up well 14 year later. Weak story, weak characters and Thomas Del Ruth's cinematography completes washes out and misses the native beauty of San Francisco."
5,Quicksliver,Kevin Bacon is a good actor. This is a great movie without gross violence. A bonus for any cyclist because of the extensive use of the bike on the street.
4,"So SAD, it's FULL screen (1.33:1)","Screen Format states ....1.33:1 = Full Screen, I hate 1.33:1What's sad it costs extra $$$$$ for them to make a Chop and Crop (Pan & Scan) version from an originally filmed Widescreen movie.Hey, production companies ..... SQUARE TV's are history !!!!"
5,It makes it go faster,"The scene where he gets up from bed and starts oiling his bike's chaind and the chick asks why are you doing that and the bacon man says ""it makes it go faster."" Yeah, that scene is awesome."
3,It's okay,"I watched it after Premium Rush , so it was a little watered down. A feel good story , but not too much bike action. Would not recommend this to a fellow biker."
4,Quicksliver.,I watched this again last night. It is a great movie and have enjoyed it all the times I have watched it. Will recommended this oneQuicksilver
5,Found it!,"Ordered this for my husband. It was one of those movies that he talked about all the time and we could never find...anywhere! I had looked before on amazon but couldn't find it. Finally, I saw it and got it for him. It was a Christmas present and he was surprised. We have watched it at least twice since then. If you know someone who bikes or used to be a bike messenger(like my husband) or you like Kevin Bacon it is a great movie!"
2,well at least the biking is cool,"Okay, the plot s#@ked almost as hard as the acting, but the bicycling was cool. There's a scene in the middle where they do all sorts of nifty bike tricks, on road bikes nonetheless, and later they have a great race through San Fransisco. For people who like stuff like that, it's worth sitting (or at least fast-forwarding) through the rest."
2,Wildcats versus Hawks - 6 to 6,"This was on television earlier today. It's a horribly dated film. Bad pacing, bad music, with not much of a plot. Also, I'd suggest not eating at Dante's. And please, try not to kill the messengers."
1,Bacon you stink agian,"Kevin Bacon is one of the worst actors in the world and this is his worst.It had no guidence as to what the movie is about.It starts out like its gonna be a great film in the begining because the guy goes bankrupit,and your thinking wow I can't wait ans see how he's gonna get back on his feet and then he becomes a messenger for some reason and falls for another messanger named terry who is a bumb.Some guy comes in the picture you don't get a good idea who he is and for some reason wants to kill's all the messangers."
3,gotta have skills ona a messenger bike,"one of the very few movies where flatland is involved, and yea sure it might be a sucky movie but I'll support anything that supports my sport of flatland.represent!"
5,Quality product,I love Fruit of the Earth Aloe Gel! No green additives and it is a soothing thick gel anyone would be happy to use.
2,Aloe Gel,"unfortunately I bought this product and it contains Triethanolamine which I found is not to be used in products that are left on the skin, I will be throwing this away but wanted to warn others before they order that this may not be the product they want, I will stick with straight Aloe Vera Gel. ""Triethanolamine, safe for use in cosmetics and personal care products designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the skin. In products intended for prolonged contact with the skin, the concentration of Triethanolamine.. should not exceed 5%."" [...]"
1,Doesn't Absorb Into the Skin,"Just like the title says, this product doesn't absorb into the skin. I'm in the desert and I can use this product in the morning, and when I shower after work the water will reactivate the gel as if the product dried immediately and sat there... no absorbtion... no change in condition, even after days of use(two applications per day).Thankfully I still had a cheap store brand that after one application, I noticed a differance. This is a horrible product. I'm thankful that I didn't buy the twin pack."
3,Average,"Interface: Poetry and Selected Readings, Volume One, 2010This book is an average introduction to cultures book. The fonts is somewhat small and you may need reading glasses. There are a lot of definitions which is good. Informative for the beginner but I feel that the price should be dropped. Somewhat costly."
3,A Selection of Tattoo Designs,"Although this compilation of tattoo designs was interesting, it was , for me, limited as to the variety of designs pictured. I would still recommend it to anyone who is new to the area of tattoing as a form of art, or wants to get started on deciding what to get permanently decorated with. I think the more you see before getting ""inked"" the better - it's hard to get it removed once it's there - so take a look at as many designs as you can, maybe even including this book."
1,Horrible,"Ordered to use in my car to play phone.. Horrible quality, bad feedback when using. Also low volume. I would not order these unless you want to waste your money."
1,Not MINI,These are not mini 3.5 plugs. They are wide at the base and will not fit a mobile cell phone earphone jack. If you need to hook up audio to your cell phone the base on these is too large to fit completely in in the jack thus no sound.
5,No surprises,"Paid $3 for this cable. It is 6feet long and well shielded. The cable easily reaches all the way to the back seat. The volume from my ipod is a bit on the lower side as compared to the radio. I don't know if it's the cable. Nonetheless, the audio quality is good and at this price point you can't ask for more."
4,Simple cable,"It's a 3.5 stereo cable, it works. Gets stiff when sitting in a car below freezing temps but works and is expected for the gauge."
5,Perfecto!,"The CenturyMen is an excellent, well-discipline, well-trained group. The arrangements are wonderful. Fact is, I can only say great things about this album and this group."
4,Great entry level juicer,"I wasn't sure I would juice much, so I chose this one because it wasn't one that required a financial investment. I have been juicing three to four times a week for the last 10 months and this juicer hasn't missed a beat. I didn't give it 5 stars because the directions recommend ""no citrus"". I have seen reviews about juicers being easy to clean, I don't think this one quite meets that discription. Several of the pieces can go in the dishwasher, but the main piece has to be brushed with a small brush that is included. If you have a garbage disposal, I think this would be much easier to clean. I don't, so I have to get all the pulp off before washing."
4,"Very Good for the Price, but Add Earplugs to Your Cart Before You Checkout","Those that are complaining about this juicer should take another look at the price tag. For $20, it is a fantastic deal. Sure, you can get a better juicer, but be prepared to spend ten time this amount for it. I've had no problems juicing both fruits and vegetables, and the cleanup was surprisingly simple and quick. My only complaint is that it sounds like a wood chipper. It is very, very loud so be prepared for neighbors to stop by to make sure everyone is OK. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase!"
4,Fresh juice anyone?,This is a great buy. It's a real heavy duty unit. All stainless steel and everything is dishwasher safe. Kids love using it to make fruit drinks and smoothies.
2,Looks nice... lousy design,"The juicer does work well in terms of ""as it's supposed to"". It does produce juice without too much prep work and quite easily.What doesn't work so well is it's basic cup design. The metal cup at the bottom vibrates so much when the machine is on, that it wants to walk out of the cup-slot while I'm juicing. I have to prop it with a dish towel to keep it in place. This is quite annoying to me and merited a demotion from 3 stars for Average-Good to 2."
5,Years of use and still going strong - love it!,"I wasn't sure I'd use this but when it came up for a fantastic sale several years ago thought I'd give it a try...after all, juicing is supposed to be so much healthier than sugar-laden prepared products. Although this is a bit loud, never having others to compare it against I've come to learn it's within the more or less normal range. Simple to use and after 2 1/2 years - still going strong. We now juice almost daily and this has been one of the best buys we ever made. Excellent product, very durable and wonderful juice!"
3,Waring Juice Extractor,"First, this juicer is marked down which is a red flag. I'll tell you why. THe feed chute is incredibly small. You have to cut everytning into narrow pieces so it fits in. THe pulp collector is inside the machine and gets filled very fast. I was juicing about 6 carrots with a few sticks of celery. The pulp catcher was full already. I hate the fact that I need to disassemble the machine and dump the pulp container more often than I should. At $50, it may see like it's a bargain and if you're juicing once a week then it may be but if you're planning on using this every day and juice a lot of vegetables then forget about it. It is a hassle. There are way better juicers to be found for a few bucks more."
4,got what I paid for,"This is my first juicer so I did not want to spend a lot of money. It is a bit messy as sometimes the juice splatters out of the top when you are adding more food. The catch bin for the fiberious parts is around the blade and can become very full, but because it is black, you have to dissasemble it to be able to tell. Clean up is not too difficult and I like the compact shape. I will upgrade eventually, but for occasional juicing, this is fine for now."
4,Worth $30,Everything is good as expected.One thing needs to be improved. The hole to put fruits is too small. Had to slice an apple to 5 pieces to get through the hole.
4,Waring JEX328FR,I purchased a refurbished model for $29.00. Since I have never used a juicer before I have nothing to compare it to. This model does exactly what I expect and for the price I don't think you could find a better deal.
4,Makes excellent juice,This product came in great condition and makes the best juice I have ever had. The only downside is that it takes a lot of fruit to make a little juice. I imagine that this is problem with all juicers but that is why I only gave it 4 stars.
2,overall use of the waring blender,"Although the price c annot be beat, the product is very noisy and food must be cut into very small pieces to operate....cleaning up after using is a nightmare....."
5,FANTASTIC BUY AND PRODUCT!,"Great buy, excellent product and of excellent quality! My family loves it!"
4,"Great Juicer, Great Price","I was looking for a juicer to try, but didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on it since I wasn't sure how often I would use it...This juicer serves its purpose nicely. It looks and works great. Cleaning isn't super easy, but it isn't too much of a pain either. I suspect that any juice extractor you buy is going to have some essential cleanup involved.I almost splurged and got the Jack LaLaine, but am very happy I bought this one. It was less than $30 and I still feel like I splurged - good quality machine, great price,"
5,You just can not beat the price.,"This is the only juice machine I have ever used so I can not compare it to the others,but wow. This thing is fantastic. I use it every day. Sturdy, simple, effective. It works well and cleans up fairly easily. I bought the refurbished model and for the price you just can not beat this. If you have never had a juice machine get this one. It came packaged up just as if I had bought it in a store. Not a mark on it, and it runs great. No complaints."
5,Great Purchase for Price,"I have never owned a juicer before so I have littel to compare it to. I can say that this juicer makes one glass of juice before you have to remove the pulp to continue juicing. Pulp removal is almost hassle-free, though, and takes about 10 seconds...so not a significant problem. Very little foam produced from the juicing, thereby keeping the vitamins in tact. I was not sure if I would use a juicer. Now I know I will use one for the rest of my life. Overall, a great buy."
1,Not a good juicer,"This juicer didn't cost much, and isn't worth much. You get what you pay for. It looks good, but doesn't get all of the juice out of the fruits and vegetables. The pulp is pretty soggy, meaning there is still a lot of juice left in it. The juice you do get out is full of pulp, not well strained. Save your money and invest in a better juicer. This is not worth it. I stuck it up in the closet and will never use it again."
2,not too great,"I have always been wary of these ""juicers"" and this one pretty much reaffirms that belief. Seems like only ~10-15% of the juice is extracted and even then, its ""thick"" with micropulp.There is a lot of wasted juice in pulp as well. Stick with the old-school hand juicer if you want to get the most out of your oranges."
3,Good for the money,"But definitely doesn't get all of the juice out. I bought this to mainly juice oranges - and it leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't just leave damp pulp - it leaves completely soaking wet pulp with a lot of juice wasted. However, at $30 or whatever I paid for it, it's probably as good of a juicer to be found at that price."
1,Faulty juicer,"I was making my first ever carrot juice with this refurbished machine, and it suddenly stopped. I could not get it to re-start afterward, so I returned it for a refund. Now I'm searching for an affordable Vitamix juicer on Ebay."
1,Does Not Work!,"I bought this reconditioned and paid for the shipping and then found that it totally does not work so I have to ship it back. Certainly it seems that If you buy something that is factory reconditioned it should work -- else, why sell it?"
3,got it and never used it,fruit and vegetables are just too expensive to put in a juicer. makes a great gift if you have someone that can afford to feed it.
2,you get what you pay for,"First thing I noticed was that it was made in China, although the quality seems OK, considering the under $30 price. However don't expect that you are getting anything like the heavily advertised $100+ juicer you see advertised on TV. Of course, I have no experience with the one on TV, but this one is just not that great. First problem is that this juicer leaves a very wet pulp. We made apple juice and it took a lot of apples at 99c a pound to get a very little juice and a lot of wet pulp. If you think you can use the messy pulp for baking (as suggested), you'll have to pick out the seeds and large chunks of skin first. My suggestion is to eat your fruit whole and if you want juice, buy it at the store."
2,Not very good,"The thing looks great and it is big, but size is not everything :-) The unit does not remove all the juice from my produce and it sprays when you first place items in it. I would not buy this unit if I were you."
3,"It works, but not the greatest by any means","I ordered this as our entry into juicing. It is a centrifugal juicer, not as desirable as a gear juicer or auger juicer - also, when pushing down on the feeder, you can actually end up shaving plastic off the bottom of the pusher. This isn't desirable at all.Bottom line is that it worked for us until we purchased a Samson 6 in 1 auger type juicer.If you want to try juicing and aren't sure, the price is right and you can try it out for not a great deal of money. Overall durability and length of life is in doubt."
4,Awesome Deal,Purchased it for my mom since her old juicer broke. She loves it and tells me that it works very well without any problems (so far). It's a great deal for the price. It's not that loud as other reviews may have stated.
1,I tried this today for the first time,"and was very disappointed. with the good reviews I was excited to have a juicer at such a good price. I did not force the vegetables but let it do the work itself. the pulp does not stay in the little trap. it goes everywhere down into the machine. it took me over 10 minutes to clean it. there was juice, and it tastes fine but the mess is so not worth it. this is going back..."
2,"""Like A Virgin"" Remix",It's basically an extended version with some minor music changes. '80's mixes are so cheesy! You're better off with the original version.
2,horrible,"Where to begin? This is one of the worst ""jazz"" recordings I have ever heard in my life. The only thing worse than this is her other CD ""Easy to Love"" (which should have been called easy to hate).I wish I could get my money back, but a used CD store said they couldn't get rid of the ones they already had. Enough said.Sam"
2,Strike of the Filler...,"Dragon Ball Z to me is the best anime. BUT...with FUNimation still doing their 3 episodes on one disc thing, we have to wait until NEXT YEAR until we get to the great Nappa and Vegeta fighting. There SHOULD be 5 episodes on one disc but NO! As for the episodes...this is the worst patr of the series. Boring, dumb, and not that exciting. FUNimation should start picking up the pace for Cartoon Network has already start showing the Frieza saga."
2,Too light,"I was given this book, and felt compelled to read it through, but there wasn't much to pull me forward in it except my obligation to try to appreciate a gift from a friend. I failed to see a story in it. It reads like a collection of light humorous essays, that never varies in theme. Although I was touched at times by the smiling tone, that wasn't enough to let me recommend it."
5,Quality Item,Adapted perfectly to RV male 30A and plugged right into Generator 30A 3 prong recepticle.
1,"Oil, Racketeers and Opportunists","Neal Adams is one of those uneducated morons with a low grade education who perhaps had some other people - with hatred for Arabs and Muslims - help him right the book ""Oil & Terrorism."" Just working in the oil industry as a firefighter does not make Neal Adams an expert on other cultures and religions. Adams lives in Houston and regretably he belongs to the same society, which I belongs to - The Society of Petroleum Engineers. In the age of lies and deception, this book will make a good reference for the ignorant and the hateful."
4,Great book for dog lovers except for 2 words,"My 28 month old thinks this is the funniest book. We checked it out of the library and I will have to buy it since it is now her favorite book. She loves the way half of the story is from Loki's perspective. She has taken to saying things like ""old buddy, old pal."" The only thing I dislike is the choice of the word ""stupid"" as Loki refers to a ball (I say silly when I read it to her,) I don't want her to think that is a word we use. And the same goes for the word ""fat"" Loki says the last one up the stairs is a ""big fat fur ball."" Maybe I am too PC consciuos but theses 2 words slightly spoil an otherwise great book."
4,Is everything you know wrong...?,"One gets breathless reading, for what could well be, a well-written science fiction story: an episode of THE OUTER LIMITS; One then wonders-chicken or egg? Did these events inspire fiction as they leaked out, or did the TV show inspire the author. Written in such a matter-of-fact style, that one is easily sucked into the proceedings... Totally fraudulant fiction, or secret research on the edge of forever...? Next to the PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT, the MONTAUK PROJECT is fast becoming as well known, and even if partly true, is bone chilling;"
1,New Montauk Article a must read,"Reporter Chris Ketchum brings it all home with an excellent,objective, and honest report on the Montauk Project for national men'smagazine, Gear. ...Don't miss this one!"
2,Too Dry to Work With,While I like the wood and am using it the blanks were very dry and tend to splinter when turned.
1,False advertisement,thought there were more than two blanks. spent $30 on them. should have shown that there were only 2. now i need one more word.
1,after reading the reviews!,I dont understand why this product is here! It shows multiple blanks in pic and customers say they only get one and thats if they recieve it at all! come someone needs to investigate this and maybe pull it from the marketplace.
3,Nothing Great about it,"I have used this book as Beginner of FEA and didn't find it interesting. It deals with more theoretical aspects of FEA. It does really deal with using FEA on a regular basis. May be it's the person who taught the class made me disinterested in the book... others might find it interesting. I believe that the Theory behind FEA is important before even you start working on the software, but this is not the book I would recommend to read before you start."
5,the best cd in music history!,"this is a great cd!the best songs are 1.perfectly,a great song ,one of the best songs.2.nothings wrong with me,very up beat and active,a very good song.4.get real.a very inspiring song and it sort of tells you to deal with things and move on.5.when the rain falls.slow but kind of meaningful and inspiring.the other songs(7-8)stink."
3,"The movie was great, but what about the cd?","I loved the movie Pixel Perfect and I wanted to get this cd for my birthday. But after hearing the review's it got I think I showed get something better.So the movie would get 5 stars, but the cd I would give 3 stars to just because of what people said about it."
4,Awesome!,"I loved this movie! It was a little weird, so I watched it again and it really grew on me. There's a certain part in the movie where the main character sings a ballad called ""When the rain Falls."" This song was intreging. It REALLY motivated me to buy the cd. I would reccomend this cd anyday."
5,One of the best,"Yeah, if uve seen the movie u should like the album, the zetabytes rule definetly. i didn't think the movie would be good but boy it was. everyone should watch pixel perfect"
4,Music Perfect!!,"I LOVE the first five songs because they come from the movie, and the last three songs just dont appeal to me. But I just love ""Notice Me"" and ""When The Rain Falls"". I also like ""Perfectly"" and ""Get Real"", and of course I also like ""Nothing's Wrong With Me""!"
1,Why?,"Did the kids on the TV even really sing the songs? From that looks of it, nope. Waste of a money. Don't buy it"
1,Yuck!,"Ok, first of all, this is the most borring CD I have ever heard! The movies is a snoozefest also. The singers on here are awful!!!"
5,Pixel Perfect,I absolutely love the songs. My favorite when the Rain falls is very inspirational. This CD is a must have!!
4,pixel perferct,"I think that the music on pixel perfect is perfect. I love singing to the music, it's just great. You should definately buy it, it's not a waste of money! It's an awesome cd!"
2,Lalaine!,"If u wanna rock by lalaine is the only good song on this cd, though notice me is ok, but the singing sounds to computer generated... but u should definately get this cd for the song if u wanna rock!!!!!!"
4,Perfect,"I loved this C.D!!! My favorite track would either be ""Notice Me"" or ""When the rain falls"". Though I am wondering if in the movie they lipsyncd some of the songs. Even if it's is sung fake, the music is still cool. If you are a little more on the emotional side then you should buy it.Though it does have a rock song on it."
2,Least favorite of the B. Page card sets.,"I purchased these along with Olivia's lucky ladies playing cards and the Bettie Page playing cards. Right away, the packaging for the playing cards fell apart, came unglued. As for the cards themselves, only the royals are given pictures of Bettie, the rest are just numbered cards. Some people may enjoy this, but personally I find it less than stellar. I must also add that I've come to determine I fell for the Olivia version of Bettie Page, and the actual images of her do not have the same appeal to me as the fantastical renderings that Olivia brings."
5,"Great reading, great teaching","This is an exceptionally intelligent book! I was one of the many who knitted a scarf ages ago, was unhappy with the outcome and thought I'd never go back. The Knitting Goddess has convinced me it will be worth my while to give it another try. After learning about the basic stitches and types of yarn, and even better, reading romantic and inspiring stories about goddesses related to the world of knitting, I'm ready to start. And I really enjoyed the website with photographs of the projects."
3,"Interesting Stories, Less About ""How-To""","Bergman provides us glimpses of knitting throughout history and ties knitting into myth. She also writes a lot about knitting in the context of myth that historically has featured weaving.While the stories are interesting, the book's value for patterns not that strong. The main problem I have is not really being able to tell how the patterns would knit up. This has partly been alleviated by the website, ... but it would be nice to have better pictures of the garments in the book.All in all, this is not a book for those learning to knit. It is more of a spiritual knitting companion, to feel connected to the knitting community now and throughout time."
2,"Nice stories, but book lacks depth","I will admit that, as someone who has been knitting consistently for over a decade and who learned to knit about thirty years ago from my Mother, I probably have a deep prejudice against ""neophytes"" writing books about knitting. This woman admits to only have knitted for two years when she wrote this book! While the stories are nice, I feel that this book lacks depth. For about the same money, you can get both of Mary Thomas's books -- Mary Thomas's Knitting Book and Mary Thomas's Book of Knitting Patterns -- books written by a real Knitting Goddess, which open up a truly vast knitting universe."
5,A knitting book to curl up with,"This book is not just a knitting book--it is one to curl up with and read--the myth adaptations are so much fun. Personally, I love the purple ink, too--this is a fun, informative book. I think, as another reviewer mentioned, this was ""the book that started it all""--the Knitting Goddess was one of the ""forefront"" books when the current knitting craze began.Deborah, will we ever have another book from you--maybe a companion/sequel to The Knitting Goddess? Though it's been many years now since the Goddess was published, you have many fans and I wonder when we'll hear from you again. I enjoy this writer's work so much that I also bought her Inner Voyager personal journal/workbook--another gem. I hope Deborah is happily knitting, wherever she is--and I hope she graces the knitting world with another lovely book one day."
3,"Not what you expected, but good anyway","I expected... something else. however, I found the chapters fascinating, and really enjoyed the way she related various Goddesses to knitting (and vice versa). There aren't many of the patterns that I thought I'd want to make, but found myself all but compelled to make the Isis shawl. Then, I thought I'd never use it, but it's a favorite in my wardrobe.She's not the best knitting teacher, if you don't have other resources, but the book is a good one."
5,Myth and Yarn,"I loved ""The Knitting Goddess"". It gave me a new perspective on my second-favorite hobby, combined my two favorite hobbies (knitting and reading), and gave me lots to think about. Highly recommended!"
4,Get larger memory,"I bought these when memory was still expensive. I use them as back-ups now, but with the price of compact flash memory so cheap now, go for at least 256MB."
5,Intelligent dance-oriented songs,"Funky Green Dogs' third album ""Super California"" is great! They just get keep getting better & better! I love the hits ""Rise Up"" and ""Burnin' Up"" as well the rest of the album. Tamara's ocals are on point! Anyone who enjoys lyrically based dance-oriented songs should do themselves a favour and get this incredible album! You will not be disappointed!"
5,Super California!,"I love this CD by the Funky Green Dogs! I can't get enough of Tamara and her vocals! I got to tell you, if you don't own a funky green dogs CD, you got to own this one! Burnin' Up is my favorite and their are still 6 more that I can't seem to stop playing! Review this CD and tell me I'm wrong! I dare you!"
3,Lost in Translation,"Glory is a Swedish melodic hard rock band that features former Yngwie Malmsteen vocalist Goran Edman. Glory delivers basic, but solid, melodic rock. It is also a bit...odd. Much of this is due to the lyrics, which I have to assume made a lot more sense in Swedish than they do in English. Some of the songs are downright weird (Kite of Love and Metal Meter Maid for example). It's also strange to see a Journey-inspired band on a label like Black Mark, which is better known for its death metal releases. Still, Edman's vocal performance is quite good, and makes Wintergreen worth checking out.Wintergreen was Glory's final album. Edman went on to other melodic rock projects, like the excellentWonderlandalbum by Kharma and the very Journey-esque band Street Talk."
5,Fascinating history,I read this to prepare for an Elderhostel in Lafayette LA. It was a revelation to realize I am practically going to a foreign country (from Minnesota). Every aspect of the Cajun culture was described. I'm looking forward to crawfish.
5,"Fantastic album, never grow tired of hearing it","I knew nothing about this band when I ordered their CD a few years ago, I'd just heard a track on some animated clip I'd watched. Since then this has become one of my favorite CDs. It sounds fresh and complex each time I hear it, the melodies and grooves stick in your head, and overall it's really an amazing album. How to describe it? It's tough, but mix modern beats, rock guitar (acoustic and electric) with the occassional country twang and you'll get an idea. It feels like the Beatles: fresh inspiration wrapped up in melodies that haunt. Enjoy!"
4,pretty cool,I saw these guys play in Montreal last February and they blew the crowd away. I was even more stoked when Kid Koala joined them onstage for a tune! I hope these dudes come back to my 'hood soon. Their CD is decidedly more electronic [and eclectic] but definitely retains the energy of their live show...pretty cool stuff in my humble opinion.
3,"If you are a Nevil Shute fan, you should read this.","As the author's note tells us, this was the second book that he had published. It is a good enough story, but clearly his style and ability for linking the different elements of his story was still under development. It does not have that ""can't put it down"" quality that his later books have. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories of this part of the 20th century where the differences in the British social classes was still evident."
3,Interesting Point of View,"I like this book and it is written in a sort of old-fashioned English novel way. The story was very interesting and unexpected because I take today's technology for granted. A good read on a plane (well, maybe not..)."
1,Oh God,"This song is disgusting. ""Pink elephants and lemonade""? I mean, what is this?? ""In the land of make-believe..."" It's totally gross. What what Madonna thinking? This song is a joke. It's random. It doesn't fit with anything Madonna's every done. It's dumb. Don't waste your money. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
4,Pink Elephants and Lemonade,"This song is highly overlooked and degraded, but it is a pretty decent Madonna song. I agree that is the video for this song was atroucious, but the song is okay. This song does kind of fit in with Like A Prayer, in the sense Madonna opening up to her childhood. The cd here is okay, but there is no remix, no unreleased b-side, or anything spectacular.1. Dear Jessie (Album Version): This song is exactly like the Lp Version, except it does not fade into ""Oh Father"".2. Till Death Do Us Part: Madonna's comeback song to former husband Sean Penn. This song goes well with Dear Jessie, but could have been more hardcore, if it's a comeback song.3. Holdiay (12"" Version): The full length version of Holiday."
5,While the songs have nothing to do with each other...,"""Holiday"" is a perky dance track. ""Dear Jessie"" is an adorable classic. ""Till Death Do Us Part"" is an unconventional divorce ballad that knocks your socks off.There's no consistency in the grouping, but that's okay. This way, you get a showcase of ""Dear Jessie"" and ""Till Death Do Us Part"", two songs that deserve the spotlight.Insignificant? Hardly."
4,just 4 the record,"back in the vinyl days in 1987, Dear Jesse was released as the 4th single from the album like a prayer in Britain.(oh father was released as the 4th single in america. by the way, madonna has the most consecutive top5 hits until oh father according to billboard, didn't even make the top40.) dear jesse is accompanied with a video. if you hadn't seen it you didn't miss much. you'll find no madonna but a pink elephant through out the scene. the version on this single is equilvalent to what on the album except it fades out in the end."
2,The Wild And The Unatmed,"I was a bit dissapointed in this compliation to be quite honest. The CD back cover promises Radio London jingles, but they are not on THIS CD. The sound is good, but you can tell that some tracks were lifted durectly from a vinyl source.Nothing here that you cannot live without I am afraid. Shel Talmy produced as his answer to replacing The Who - not even in the same league I am afarid, even though they do cover The WHo's :It's Not True."""
5,An American Classic,"Love this CD, Forever and always. Grease paint and monkey brains, turn it up and drive really, really fast in the desert."
5,WZ's best CD of all ..,"White Zombie went out, recorded this, and kicked some heavy @$$ in the process. Heavy guitars, hard drumming, and synths in the background make this an awesome CD. It even features clips from various BRated Movies."
2,"""Is this art?""","Rob Zombie's vision of art is little more the repulsive visuals with a minimum of talent to back it up. 'Astro-Creep 2000' is more of a portfolio then it is anything else. The band is at its worst on songs like ""I Zombie"" and ""Blood Milk and Sky"". I guess if you looked at this CD as a teeny bopper horror movie then it might have more appeal. The only songs that show what Zombie and the crew could do are ""More Human Than Human"" and ""Real Solution #9"". These are both great songs and have an intesting sound. But thats as far as it goes. Rob Zombie's best bet is to let his band join in more on the song writing. He seems to think that his style is the only style, and that his style is good. Well, he is wrong on both accounts. But until we hear more of the band, White Zombie should just be called Rob Zombie's Tour Band!"
2,It gets two b/c the music is okay,"I got this cd and Rob's cd. Both of them have some songs with good guitars, drums, etc.(More Human than Human,Electric Head Pt. 2), but I dont like any of the lyrics. This is b/c I am a Christian. Sometimes the stuff is just too weird and seems too much like "" Devil music""(especially Super-Charger Heaven, all the pics in the book, all the lyrics). Because of this it is difficult to listen to it, especially if you can understand some of the lyrics.I like heavy music but some of the contents in this album offend me. It seems blatantly satanic sometimes, and that is not a good thing."
1,HOW can you even BEAR to...nevermind.,"I was visiting a friend's house who had long talked about his favorite band, ""White Zombie"", when I heard this CD. After a couple of minutes of this garbage I couldn't take it anymore and had to leave the room. It has a certain fingernails-screeching-across-a-blackboard sound to it coupled with somebody, (I'm assuming it's Rob Zombie), emitting some sort of guttaral, gravelly sound which nobody could argue is even close to singing. I suppose if you like the ear-wrenching, stomach-churning feeling you get from the experience of listening to this stuff, that's your own choice. But this can never, in any way, be considered music."
4,Not That Good,"I think that this CD is not as good as ""La Sexorcisto:Devil Music Vol.1"". My reason is because of the industrial stuff and sampling. If the CD didn't have all the sampling and other industrial stuff it would be better. It does have some good songs though, like ""I,Zombie"" and ""El Phantasmo and the Chicken-Run Blast-O-Rama""."
1,censored version!!!,I downloaded this album from amazon and recieved the cencored version. WTF!!! I'm pissed off and considering switching to itunes.
5,Everyone should own this...,"This album kicks a**!!! It is personaly one of my favorites by Rob... Yeah, you should all buy this."
5,best cd ever,this is defenently one of the best cd's ever put out. noone in their right mind would ever be disapointed after buyin this cd. I'll bet theres not a single bad review
2,I didn't realise this was censored.,"I got this album in hopes that I was getting the original but it turned out to be the censored version. Apparently, the original version is marked as [Explicit]. I think the censored version should have [Censored] on it. In any case, be careful with your buy. If you want the original make sure it has [Explicit] in the title. The censoring makes it sound like a CD skipping and disrupts the songs entirely.Please note that the album itself is awesome. I just needed to replace the one that I lost. White Zombie rocks!"
5,The way every Zombie album should be,"Best album by Zombie ever. The songs pump through your veins and get your adrenaline pumping. The lyrics are funny if you don't take them seriously, and the music is incredible. Highlights are Blur The Technicolor (my favorite song), Super-charger heaven, Electric Head 1 &2, I, Zombie. The Rob Zombie Albums had some good songs, especially the song Scum of the Earth, but the albums don't even compare to this."
5,A must buy for all Zombie fans,"This is the best album ever! I HIGHLY recomend that you buy this album! At times, it has good heavy rock like the song, Super Charger Heaven. Techno sounds like, More Human than Human. Finally, stuff that is more mellow like Blood Milk and Sky and Grease Paint and Monkey Brains. Has a bit of everything. Absolute best Zombie album to date! My fav is I, Zombie. If you don't like the lyrics, buy the edited version! A must have! This music is too interesting to not hear!"
3,,"My wife finds this product very helpful.I need a pillow with a little more firmness, but this will do."
5,Slide Guitar For Rock & Blues,"Great DVD for someone needing more challenge playingslide guitar. Roy Rogers is ""The Master of Slide""This DVD will give even talented players some thing to work on.Would highly recommend."
2,Roy Rogers Slide Guitar,The main problem with this DVD is that it doesn't properly play on a PC. I had to contact the manufacturer and they had me download a viewer that works on a PC and also download the entire DVD in a different format.
5,"Pachmayr F325 Black Base Shotgun Recoil Pad (Small, Black)",Purchased to put on my coach gun. This is a great pad for the price and will fit the stock good.
5,Best early club mixes on one CD,On this CD you will find remixes of four of Madonna's earliest big hits. Lucky Star and Borderline stand out the most as they have an ethereal feel to them that the original versions do not have.
1,Does not fit listed bikes,THis is the WRONG plug for an XT 225. It is also about 3x the cost it can be purchased at any local automotive shop.
4,History of the Planet-Superman relationship,"I have always thought of the Daily Planet newspaper more as an actual character than merely a setting in Superman stories, and ""Superman: Daily Planet"" nicely covers the longtime relationship between the Man Of Steel and the Great Metropolitan Newspaper. Okay, so Superman actually interacts with Planet staffers Perry White, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olson -- when they are working on news stories, to me they ARE the Daily Planet. If you're a Silver Ager who's trying to catch up with what's happened sine you stopped reading comics, read this volume. If you're a younger reader who's interested in the history of Superman, read this volume. If you just enjoy stories about Clark Kent's workplace, read this volume."
2,Woa,"Literally exploded within a week of using. I used it with normal use, on during day for 12hrs and off at night. One day it just burst into pieces when I was sitting right next to it and my Iguana was basking. I'm not sure if its the product i purchased or the manufacturer, but it seems dangerous and I switched to another bulb."
2,Not Meditation,"This is a nice, simple daily reading book. It has concise, helpful thoughts for a life of ""less stress"". But it has nothing to do with meditation.I was disappointed to find this book is not instructive if one wants to learn more about real meditation.Peace of Mind: Daily Meditations for Easing Stress"
2,Limited,"Nothing new or expanding here, just like many more, I am disappointed. Will be taking it to a resell shop hoping someone will find so use for it."
5,Peace of Mind Daily Meditations Easing Stress,The book is great with affirmations to give you peace and to touch emotions of gladness and its positive quotes help. I reccomend this to anyone who needs quotes and short messages to get the most out of everyday. This book offers mind changing positive ways to ease almost any situation and read at random for helping whatever situation with the index.The font is bold and my eyes are getting bad so glasses are used but you won't stress to be able to see the font.Pick out this book. You will be glad you did.
5,Love my closet now.,I organized my closet with 3 of the Rubbermaid kits. This was one of the big ones that filled an 8 foot wall. These are so easy to install and easy to customize to my needs. The price is right and shipping is quick.
4,Great closet system,"I got this closet system to replace the 2 hanging vars that ere in there. It is great. There are numerous configurations that you can choose from to suit your needs best. There are also extra shelves that you can purchase for shoes, ties, etc. A great product."
4,Organized,I can now put about a 1/3 more in my closet and still see what I am looking for. The unit is very strong and well designed for the money. It is very flexible to how you want to set it up or add future additions to it. It has unclutered my closet.
3,Rubbermaid 4 to 8 - foot closet kit,"We bought the kit to be spread over two closets. So we also purchased the 25-inch extensions. What we did was use the 4-foot shelf and hanging rod with the 25-inch extension. Then we used the 47-inch extension that came with the shelf kit and used it to hang shelves onto it. Worked out great. The only problem we came across with the shelf kit was it only has 11 shelf brackets and we needed 12. Why the odd number not sure. The cost was about the same or less as the home repair store. The directions have a lot of wording. I new what they wanted me to do, so I tossed the directions and hung everything."
4,So much better than what the house came with,"I replaced this in my youngest daughter's closet so she could get to her clothes. The only regret I have is not putting the hang rail lower. I went against my better judgement and put it at the recommended height. Now when the highest slot is utilized I can't put anything larger than a shoe box on the top shelf. The closet is 23 inches deep and if yours is deeper it may not be a problem, just something to think about. On to my oldest daughter's closet, which is a walk-in. See my photos in the gallery."
4,I'm organized at last,"This product rocks. My closet is so neat now, it was almost like putting on an additon. I love it when I can use my space productively. This was easy to put together and a huge improvement from the regular pole in the closet."
4,"Great product, but pricey","I really do love this rack, I bought three of these, but they are pricey for what you get. IF they make this at $50, they would sell two more to me!"
5,Good Quality,Great quality for the price! Makes an extra room in my house look like a walk in closet without the need for cupboard etc. so i still have the space to turn it into a guest room when needed.
2,Cheaper Elsewhere,"Great Product, but there was a recent price increase on this product from 97 bucks to 134 on this website. This item is about 20 bucks cheaper on a little website that starts with e and ends with bay."
4,needs revamping,"The product works fine, at least the hot dog part. Personally I haven't used the bun warmer. Why don't they revamp this product so you can make 6-10 hot dogs and leave out the bun warmer? I love the convenience of popping the hot dogs down and having them ready in minutes, but making only 2 at a time seems less than ideal. My other complaint is it seems it wouldn't be that big of a deal to make the opening a little bigger so larger hot dogs would not get stuck. Only the smallest hotdogs fit, and those are harder to find nowdays when everything is jumbo size. Someone should reinvent this thing. I'd gladly spend more for a bigger one, especially given the price of other hot dog makers."
3,Mixed emotions,"When I saw the Hot Diggity Dogger I thought this has to be one of the slickest products I have seen in a long time. In thery it is great. In practical use it leaves something to be desired.I am still attempting to find hot dogs that will fit properly. Not too long. Not too short. Not too fat, etc. It looks like the manufacturer put a solid plate between the heating elements so the bun would not burn before the hot dog(s) were done. The only problem with that is the bun is a little on the dry side by the time the hot dog itself is done cooking.I shall keep looking for the proper dogs and buns. In the meantime I shall keep using the Dogger. It does work but not as I pictured it. But isn't that true with a lot of products we purchase today?"
5,So much fun to have!,"The day it was delivered, I got home from work, I opened up the hot diggity dogger and made 2 hot dogs & buns. It toasted the hot dog buns PERFECTLY and the hot dogs turned out delicious! I have to say, it's one of the better kitchen gadgets out there!! I love it more than my quesadilla maker! It doesn't take too long to grill and toast the hot dogs and buns either! I live by myself, so this is perfect for me! If you work a lot, this would be a good product to purchase. You can come home, pop in the hot dogs and buns, get changed, turn on the tv, and they be just about finished! I just can't get over how much of a great job this thing does! Especially toasting the buns! PERFECTO!"
5,HOT DOG!!,This roaster is tops. I won a mirror image roaster at work. We broke it out for a small get together B-B-Q ...the kids wanted dogs. Everyone was enthralled at the handiness and ease of making delicious hot dogs and buns simultaneously. We bought one for the in-laws who wanted to take ours home with them. Merry Christmas.....
4,Mmm.... I love hot dogs,"I like to eat hot dogs with mustard and ketchup... my friend thinks that is weird. Sometimes the hotdog talks after you put it into the hot dogger. They say ""let me out"" or ""it sure is hot in here"" or ""only 1 more minute until I am in your belly."" I like the last one the best. The only bad thing about this maker is it does not make Corn Dogs. I put a hot dog and some corn in the holes and it was very messy to clean up. I even got shocked a little when I tried to clean it. I recommend this to anyone who loves sushi!!!"
5,Fun! Easy!,I bought this hot dog cooker for my son. He LOVES it. It is so easy to use and to clean up. What a fun way for a kid to make his own lunch. We looked at this a few times before and I wish we had bought it sooner!
2,Can't believe this is a 4 - 5 star item,"I don't need to repeat the problems with this as even the most popular review points them out....but I will -> can't put big hot dogs in it, the basket is #$!j& HOT when it comes out and there is nothing to pick it up with, and the buns don't heat evenly, and neither do the dogs I found.I give it an extra star for innovation....but until somebody fixes the problems with this I'd stay away."
4,Neat product,"I like hot dogs occasionally, but hate the clean up. This cleans up easily. You just rinse out the pullout drip pan. I don't like the bun toaster part though. It makes you open the buns up completely which usually splits them."
4,Hot Diggity Dogger,"You have to use a very thin hot dog because it expands and then becomes difficult to pull out of the machine. Overall, the Hot Diggity Dogger is a fun cooking machine to use."
4,HOT DIGGITY,THIS ITEM WORKS WELL...MAKES HOT DOG TASTE GOOD.....HOWEVER GETTING THE HOT DOG OUT OF WIRE CONTAINER IS A LITTLE TRICKY. I MADE A SMALL METAL TONG WITH TIP BENT TO FIT THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE TOP OF THE CONTAINER....LIFT CONTAINER WITH HOT DOGS OUT OF UNIT AND LAY ON DISH...HOLD BOTTOM OF CONTAINER WITH TONG AND USE A FORK TO REMOVE HOT DOGS OUT THE TOP....AND ENJOY...
