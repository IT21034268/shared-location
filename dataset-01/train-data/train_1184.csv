1,pathetic!,save your money! ... the bargain bins will be full of this album very soon! You'll be able to buy this garbage very cheaply very soon.
5,True (S)Hero's!,"""Not Ready To make Nice"" IS THE SONG of the year if not 00's for me. I was a mild Dixie Chicks fan prior to 2003, but after the brave statement Ms. Maines made in the Uk, I took a whole new look at this group. I have not had this cd out of my Cd player since I got it Tuesday, it is smart, sassy and some of the best music I have heard in a LONG time. The Dixie Chicks are Shero's to me!"
3,Taking the Long Way w/ the Dixie Chicks,"I'm enjoying the variety of songs but I can't say honestly this album will be one that I will return to over the long haul and enjoy more instead of less.I think they delivered the message, got the pain across & I admire their talent."
5,Crossover? I think not!,"If this is supposed to be a crossover to Pop album, they have failed miserably. If this is their latest Country album.....Bravo! Well done."
2,What's ten bucks now-a-days anyway?,"After all the hype in newspapers, in magazines, on TV and on radio, I decided to buy this CD. I don't like Bush and so I was swept up in the pro-Dixie Chicks hysteria that seems to gripping many people. (Just look at all the zealous five-star reviews.)The music, unfortunately is pretty blah. The vocals sound like whining and the music is unremarkable except in that it is overdone. I noticed another reviewer used the word ""commercial"" to describe it, and I would agree with that.This is really about marketing and capitalizing on the anti-Bush sentiment out there, which I share. The CD is obviously a big seller right now but I don't think that it will stand the test of time."
3,Good..but many of the songs just meld into each other..,I was listening to this album and didn't realize that I had listened to half the album....thought it was the same song. A bit of exageration here but that was my impression.Perhaps their other albums (many songs) were so powerful that I expected to hear some of the same here. Perhaps we are inundated with music. There is so much audio/visual out there.
5,Taking the Long Way,"Recorded very well, great lyrics. This is the first Dixie Chicks Cd that I have ever bought. But after seeing them on the Grammys, I knew I wanted this particular Cd. I hope they keep speaking out against our goverment that is concerned with just power & greed."
4,Chick Flick,"Excellent album on its own but you need to see their movie ""Shut Up and Sing"" to fully appreciate this work."
4,I Like It!,"This is a very good album full of emotions. There's the anger in ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", of course, but love and hope shine through in the rest of the album. Women with spines who sing and say what they feel! What a concept. And the fight against a bullying backward establishment only made them appeal to the wider audience around the nation. It's a solid record, and it's a courageous story. No wonder it won 5 Grammys as the worthy sentimental favorite."
2,Ditzy Chicks,"The bubble-headed bimbos in this band have been acting like the worst of politicians: They apologized for dissing W when he was popular, and now, looking at his poll numbers fall, they are flip-flopping and trying to retract that apology.With this CD, the Ditzy Chicks are shifting their sound from country to pop. As you can see from the CD cover photo, they are trying to drop the rural, country girl image in favor of a new urbane one. (And even their most ardent of fans will have to admit, looking at the CD cover photo, that all three have got the most vacuous ""the lights are on upstairs but nobody's home"" look in their eyes.)The real problem is with the music: The songs on this CD range from mediocre to awful. And some of the lyrics are so bad as to be unintentionally funny.Someone should explain to these poor things that protest songs are supposed to be about injustices to the people - not injustices to the band members!"
1,This album is mainstream garbage,"This album is the worst mainstream piece of garbage I have ever heard. The only reason they won so many grammy awards is because the academy of music is a bunch of left wing liberals and they want to stick it to the president.Real good, basically your telling people its ok to bash your country while playing in another country and then we will reward you with a bunch of grammy awards for it.Complete drivel, these losers will never get a cent of my money."
1,No stars for this mess!,Bush bashers or not....this album's content is all about the Bush comment and backlash The Chicks received a few years ago. If they really wanted to move on they would have stayed away from the topic in their music (at least for 98% of the album) but it is too redundant in this album. Not their best work and I used to be a huge fan but they are losing me by the year! Not worth the cash to buy this one. Hopefully they will produce a more rounded album next.
1,The worst album of 2006,I was aghast on listening to this awful album which is more worse than their previous efforts.They have abandoned country for boring pretentious pop music tripe.I would not recommend this boring album to anyone.To me Living with war from Neil Young is a much better album and a much better purchase.
1,"Entertain us, keep your political thoughts to yourself","I have been a long time fan, but..... I was very dismayed to hear what Natalie said in concert, overseas. We pay entertainers to entertain us, not cram their political views down our throats as the only realistic, viable opinions. The freedoms we have in this country come from a long line of soldiers that put on the uniform and stood up for what America stands for. I saw them last week on the Oprah Winfrey show and as the song says, their not ready to make nice, granted the lyrics could be applied to many situations, but in this case we know what they refer too. They owe this country a big opology, and until I hear it, I won't buy their cd's anymore."
1,"Awful, Horrible, and a piece of Trash","If you liked the purity of all the instruments on Home you will hate this Album.The Chicks have gone steadily downhill since Home.On their World Tour album they included that stupid steel guitar which completely drowned out the banjo and violin.This in your face, I can say anything I want, and you can kiss my rear end attitude shows how little class they now have.There isn't one good song on this album, plus I only heard the banjo once and very little violin.Save your money, and don't waste it on these fools.They need to get back to what made them popular in the first place."
1,Really bad album,The Chicks should sing and get out of politics. This whole album is geared to making a statement. Shut up and sing girls!! We don't care about your opinions.
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE NEW CD","Have always been a Dixie Chicks fan and always will be. I truly enjoy the flavor of their music and the awesome instrumentals they never fail to deliver.This new CD is like none other and is truly heartfelt. What a fantastic comeback.Who cares that some radio stations elect not to play their music? Those of us who are loyal Dixie Chicks fans don't need to hear the music on the radio -- we just go and buy it.Sadly, people have chosen this venue as a forum to critize the Dixie Chicks rather than rate their new CD. It's doubtful that those individuals truly purchased and listened to the CD in its entirety.Give the Dixie Chicks credit for who they are and not ostracize them for voicing freedom of speech. The only crime committed here was the moron who made the death threat....he/she should be sitting in the pokey. Why is it that our society thrives on ridicule and pessimism? Get over it and stop holding on to something that happened three years ago..."
5,Fan of 'old country' loves this,"I have always been a fan of 'old country' but this CD blew my mind. The depth and quality of the songs are incredible. I can't listen to it enough. In the one song, I'm not sure but I believe they are addressing Ann Coulter, and that song in particular KICKS! Thanks ladies."
1,Not what I expected,"Because of their snub of their fan base, I thought they had the good sense to deliver a spectacular album to ""show up"" their many critics. They failed in this attempt and have alientated even more people by their recent comments."
3,"don't care about the politics, but was expecting more","Ok album for $10, but after 3 years was expecting not to have the ""edge"" of let's rehash the politics again."
2,Sorry Girls. Not Even Close,"There is so little energy and verve in this CD compared to Wide Open Spaces and Home as to make me think it is a parody of the Chicks or an elevator music knock-off. About the only spark is contained in the stupidly defiant Not Ready To Make Nice. Please Chicks, clear your mind and find some songs that don't make me want to stab myself in the eye with a pencil. I hope they get back on track with their next album because this one has derailed (temporarily, I hope) what looked to be a great career just a few years ago."
1,Why is it.....,"that my review was deleted? I just read alot of people say that their reviews for this dumb CD had their original reviews deleted, just like mine. Well, I could care less, but those of you who shout ""Free Speech"" remember that it doesn't just pertain to you anti-Bush people, it pertains to everyone. The big mouthed Natalie said some things that ticked us off, she needs to live with her consequences. I bet you if none of the reviews were deleted, this CD would only have one star. It's amazing how a 4 1/2 star CD of these women can't even sell enough tickets. Amazing, huh?"
2,Pop City,"I loved the Chicks first three studio albums, Home was great, and the Top of the World Tour CD is the best concert recording I own (we're talking over fifty years of ""record"" collecting here, and including Newport Jazz Festivals). Beyond that, I'm in synch with the Chicks politics. But my musical tastes and politics have nothing to do with each other. My muscial tastes are eclectic, or at least that's what I like to tell myself. But I can't handle this just-plain-boring CD. All the songs sound pretty much the same. There's little heart and no real fun. It's hard to hear the music for the noise. I guess this is what must pass for pop music these days -- it's certainly neither bluegrass nor Nashville country (hat acts and all). I attended the Chicks' opening night in Greenville, S.C. three years ago, which was a wonderful experience. However, for the upcoming concert I'll wait for the reports. If it's anything like this CD, I'll be staying home."
5,another winner from the chicks,"Whether you agree with the Chicks on politics or not, you have to agree that they are one of the best acts in the music business. This includes country, pop, rock, whatever. Every disc they release is better than the last and every one of them has been terriffic."
2,The low price is a giveaway,"I should have known - this album is just for the diehard fans. How good the Chicks were on Wide Open Spaces, this falls far, far short of my expectations. Ballad after ballad, the album fails to deliver. Strong harmonies, sure. Good vocal sound, OK, it's there. But albums are ultimately about a story; if they are not, I'm not interested. I'd rather go to a place like iTunes and purchase the songs I really like and skip the rest. 'Taking the long way' lacks the story I am looking for, the composition as a complete album, a sense of integration if you will, synthesis. And that's what I should have known before rushing to buy the CD on Amazon right when it came out: the price says everything. If it's really a rock-solid album, it won't be on sale for just under 10 bucks. They'll want more because they know it's worth more. This is just to fill the Chicks' coffers and they should be ashamed for doing that to their fans. Two stars at best."
3,An OK album,"This album is a definite shift for the Chicks as they leave their traditional fans behind, hoping to connect with another faction of society. The music is generally good, but after a couple of weeks I stopped playing it."
3,Irony,"Since Maines and company are generally reviled south of the Mason-Dixon, it's ironic that Dixie is in their name. Shouldn't they just call themselves the Chicks now?"
3,dixie chicks suck... but Natialie Mains makes a few beautiful songs,"I bought the first three Dixie Chicks cds. The first I loved. The second, I liked... the third SUCKED, I gave it away. The fourth? Some of the best songs Natalie Maines has sung. Don't get me wrong. I don't like the Dixie Chicks... SheDaisy - now that is beautiful harmony, beautiful music. The Dixie Chicks are Natalie Maines with back up singers... Who were the Dixie Chicks before Natalie Maines? Who are those other two sisters anyways? (Anyone????... Courtyard dogs? Yeah who cares about them anyways... you can get a back up singer or an instrument player anywhere.... This is a COUNTRY CD.... Even though a few songs are not typically country... give it up... If you are politically inclined and want to buy this cd for some supposed 'freedom of speech' HA! By all means, give the girls your cash.... But if it is really about the music... Just download the good songs (four at most) and get your money's worth."
4,Love this girls (moms),"Feel free to spend your money. Good compositions, good musicianship and the girls God Bless them."
2,WOW! IS THIS CD OVER-RATED,"I read all the great reviews about this CD and so I bought it. Now that I've listended to it, I can say that it is grossly over-rated and over-hyped. As other reviewers have noted, it is overproduced and the sound is poorly mixed. The music on most of the songs is a real mish-mash."
5,great cd!,this is the dixie chics best yet! i love to listen to it when driving! its calming and just overall great music!
2,"Overproduced - Reminds Me of Stevie Nicks ""Street Angel""","Most reviewers seem to disagree with me, but I found this one overproduced. The Dixie Chicks seem to have sought to change their sound, and, while they accomplished that, they went too far. I can hear some good tunes through the messy music. This one could have been much better."
4,Good but not their best,"I have enjoyed previous music by the group. I am not a country music enthusiast,and their music is really more of a light rock or even folk rock both of which I enjoy. However, the cuts on this album are more subdued than on previous. It is a nice album, but not as ""up"" as past albums."
2,Just an outlet to vent,"Earlier work by far the best. This collection was nothing more than an outlet to vent their continued frustruations with the media backlash. These ladies are far too talented to produce a mediocre album. The lullabies written about their children are worth listening to. Hopefully, they'll learn that yes, we all have a right to free speech, but it does cost (our soldiers' sacrifice and possibly their pocket books)........ maybe next time will be better"
2,Taking The Long Way,"I am not into politics, but am a big Dixie Chicks fan.But.........They should never have released this album. The songs lack any excitement, which I have come to expect from this great trio.It sounds like they have gone into the studio and run through every song with the session musicians just a few times, before going for a take.There is a sad lack of 'arrangement' throughout the album.The whole album becomes a bore after the first few songs.There is no variety of tempos to keep one interested.It just goes from one dull track to the next dull track.Although I love the girls voice, this is just too much to listen to, all the way through.Please don't put out your next album until it's ready to be proud of, like your previous ones."
3,"Okay, but sounds bit repetitious","None of the songs really stand out--they all sort of run together as a similar sound... Okay, but not the best the Dixie Chicks can do."
4,Sassy as they march to their own drummer,"Well Done, especially liked - Not Ready to Make Nice - no subservience in their charts!"
3,The musical equivalent of a chick flick,"First off, I have no axe to grind about the Dixie Chick's politics. It's their right to say whatever they want to say politically just like it's Toby Keith's right.That said, I can't say that I like this album that much. It's just too earnest. The playfulness of their earlier albums is missing. This is the kind of album and music that I would listen to - just like I go to the occasional chick flick - just to earn some points with my wife by being a good sport. If my wife wanted to go see them live, I would hope that they would still pull a Goodbye Earl out of their hats.I'm hoping that some picking and grinning makes a little bit of a comeback with the next CD. The Dixie Chicks need to find their joy again. This CD is an album you can respect; but it isn't the most enjoyable listen for a man."
2,where's the spunk?,"I'm a big dixie chicks fan despite Natalie's attempt to mix politics with entertainment. I even enjoyed the pre Natalie Dixie Chicks. But I wont stay a fan long if the albums are as dry as this one. The part I like most about the chicks seemed to have fallen by the wayside. There weren't any toe tapping, sing-a-long songs. I didn't like the remake of ""mississippi"" I thought the original played during the Rock The Vote concert was better. I understand the Dixie chicks had some important things to say here but I feel there could be a more positive way to do it. Sorry girls, still waiting for a good come back."
2,Depressing - not a good effort,"I like the DCX. I think they are the best thing to happen to country music in a long time; a breath of fresh air. I think their best effort was FLY with WIDE OPEN SPACES a close second. They sounded like they had fun recording both of these CDs, and the bands were outstanding.But TAKING THE LONG WAY is slow and boring. The songs just run together and all the fun is gone. The band is just average, like the music.I see many of the other reviews rate this 5 stars. I guess I just don't get it or understand their enthusiasm. It's just not the same sound."
2,My wife likes this one better than me - But I'm the one writing the review,"My wife bought this one. She thinks it is decent and says she would give it three and a half stars but I'm the one writing the review, so you're going to get my opinion.The music on this CD reminds me of Billie Myers, only, on many tracks, louder and with less harmony. It is the kind of CD that's going to appeal more to women than men.I read quite a few reviews here at Amazon that claim this is ""the best CD"" they ""ever heard"" or ""the greatest CD of all time."" It makes you wonder what they've been listening to. Better than Led Zep IV? The Stones' Exile on Main Street? I don't think so."
3,"More message than Music, but the Chicks are part of Iraq war history and the ultimate country outlaws","The album can be whiney and repetitive. But for the all-pro studio production values, the songs -- especially the lyrics -- too often sound like the self-absorbed ramblings of coffee house open mikers who need to get over themselves. (Ladies, THERE'S your trouble). But I would have bought the album if it had 14 blank tracks. If Country Radio can shut them down over politics, I can support them over politics. Toby Keith is a better song writer, but he is my shut-up-and-sing-dumb-biatch. God knows I wouldn't want to sit through a conversation with him. As for the Chicks...talk to me, ladies, all night long."
4,Watch out America...what a comeback!,"Even if this album was horrible, it is still great that the Dixie Chicks show that they are not buckling under the pressure of what happened three years ago when they voiced their opinion on Bush. They stand their ground and their firm beliefs in freedom of speech with ""Taking the Long Way"". However, this album is the complete opposite of horrible, it's great! Most of the songs are mellow and nice, and a very easy listen. It's one of those albums were you can sit on your front porch on a sunny day and just be at peace. For anyone who liked ""Home"" you will definately like this CD."
3,over produced album,"my politcal views have nothing to do with this review.in fact i agree with their views,but this is the worst cd i have heard in some time.some of the songs are really good but this album is overly produced,it is too loud as is all of todays cds.i am a lp record fan and i guess that colors my view some.all of todays cds are just noise.there are no soft passages in the music just one dull roar.if they release this cd to lp i will buy it because i think it has something to offer on vinyl."
5,You are all mindless swine,"Since the fanatics are bound and determined to have all the one-star reviews removed, I'll try a new strategy: I'll give the Dixie Chicks five stars and still call them out for being ungrateful, unpatriotic hacks who hold most of what America stands for in complete contempt!Because, really, all the fanatics are concerned with is the appearance of greatness, despite the lack of it on this CD or anything the Dixie Chicks say or do.I'm really surprised by the number of reviews from people who bought this CD and give it a high rating only because of the Dixie Chicks' political views. How many are wimpy NPR-listenin' city folk liberals driving around in their SUVs and feeling all warm and smug because they have a Dixie Chick CD in their glove box. Not that they actually listen to any of that...but they support them. You are truly lemmings running for the cliff.(Let's see how long this review lasts)."
5,Earls' having the last laugh!,"A conspiratorial retrospective of a young lady sticking her foot in her mouth and then watching an entire industry trying to help her unjam that big foot from her tiny little mouth.I listened in secret, sorry folks, the ship sailed off before this one could get on board. This one just plain stinks.Nothing like their first few albums."
3,chicks new entry,"a few good songs ----- not nearly as good as ""HOME"" & ""FLY"" - not even close. Voices still great , lyrics going over the edge---------politicians they are not --- get back to entertainment."
1,Disappointed,First CD I bought of theirs & am disappointed. Will probably pawn off the cd onto someone I know.
1,Poor Attempt at Pop,"While talented musicians, the Dixie Chicks need to stick to country and stop trying to crossover to pop. This is their attempt to ""dis"" their country audience... Poor attempt at that...UGH."
1,Sadly Self-Indulgent,"After all the hype, I'd hoped it would be an album back to their musical roots; sadly it is not. Too bad."
5,What a Deal!,"Perhaps those who can't accept that the Dixie Chicks dare to disagree with a politician should take the long way to China where people who disagree with the government are put in jail (or worse). I bet they'd be a lot happier there than in American where we do have the right to do that.We also have the right to listen to this great music. The title track here alone is worth every penny and songs like ""Favorite Year,"" ""Silent House,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" and ""Easy Silence"" aren't far behind. Celebrate our First Amendment freedoms and get some great music two. What a deal!"
5,Michaela from Germany a new Fan Girls,"I have heard about the Dixi Chicks, seen them on the CMA Award. I thought nice, but since I saw them on Larry King live, I learned to appreciate not only their music but their courage and ""big time back bone"" to stand up for what they say - ! unfortunatly you aren`t so free if you do not speak as the masses want you to! -But how else will change come, if not for but a few to start....Because of the interview I went out and bought the Album, and especially the Songs 2 and 3 made me cry. The lyrics and music and vocals are so beautiful. Keep up and be encouraged I would say to them. This album ist beautiful - I do not recommend easily - but this one I will -"
3,Center Of Your Will,"""Center Of Your Will"" is my absolute favorite! When I bought this CD, I played track #2 about 10 times before I would even listen to anything else. Twila Paris is truly a gifted and anointed woman of God!"
1,"Too short, not as viewed!","I purchased this organizer so I can stack my coffee cups and saucers to eliminate putting one cup inside the other. Unfortunately I have 3 different cup sizes and none of them was fitting below like the picture. I need to mention that none of my cups are really large since I do not like them.... I am talking for ""illy"" type cappuccino cups.The only thing I can fit below and in the second self was either espresso cups or a stack of three saucers. It ends up taking up more space than creating. This is the worst type of organizer that I have purchased and unfortunately it is not worth returning it since the seller does not cover the cost and it is a bulky item."
5,2 Shelf Cabinet Organizer,"I purchased the 2 shelf wire cabinet organizer to improve storage in my kitchen pantry. It's great! The product is sturdy and sits stably on the wire pantry shelving. The 3 tiers enable me to store paper plates, bowls and napkins with easy accessibility and less wasted space. My only recommendation is that the depth be increased. I intend to order another unit today!"
4,Very compact shelf organizer.,"I bought this without realizing the size. Once I put it on the shelf I wasn't sure what I would be using it for, as the shelves in this organizer are shallower than hoped for. However, I have come to realize that my 9X13 glass cake pans sit on it perfectly with a little bit of room, if needed. It will eliminate chips in the sides from being stacked and suffled around. I can even put a smaller pan inside and still place it on a shelf. I am glad I ordered this. For my plates, bowls and cups, however, I will still stay with the china dish racks."
2,Tippy,"I was disappointed with this for dishes as shown. There is little support on the sides and wasn't perfectly flat. We are still using it but not for heavy plates and dishes - instead for lighter items in a different cabinet. I wouldn't purchase of dishes, especially if there are children who will be grabbing the dishes off this rack. I did find another one that was much more sturdy that I am very happy with: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LZCCM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2"
3,No enough height between each shelf,I think it's ok. I may pick another product next time. There is not enough space between each shelf and most of my cups don't fit in.
5,space,I was wanting to use the space better in the kitchen cabinets and purchased this. It really helped organize the area. Now I can keep the dishes together in one area.
2,Cabinet Dish Organizer Rack,"Returned this item due to it not holding my Fiestaware dishes. I thought from the photo & description I would have no problems having plates,cups,bowls all fit onto rack for better organization of my cupboard. The dishes were too big to hold all onto this rack. I decided to purchase a smaller corner rack to stack my plates."
4,Not flimsy!,"This space-saving dish organizer is nice and solid. A lot of kitchen cabinets waste space over the dishes, so this sort of thing comes in handy. About the only complaint I have is that sometimes these organizers are a bit lopsided and you have to pull and push them into place. Sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesn't."
1,"Grayline 40126, Large two Shelf Organizer, White","This product isnt great because it did not fit my cabinet. this product are design for bigger and wider cabinets, not for Small and Norrow Cabinets. This isnt not good Product. if you have wider and bigger, this is the one you should buy..."
5,Very Few Finer Men & Units Than Donahue's,"I was a REMF who worked in intel activities at the lowest to the highest levels from January 1966 to August 1970, with my last assignment tasked to SOG. Mostly unofficially, but some officially, I supplied intel to units like Donahue's. There were a very few other units like his so his was not the ""only"" real guerrilla force in Vietnam. I eagerly supported these men in anyway I could, to include ""midnight requisitioning"" things they wanted or needed from Saigon. Donahue writes well and gives the reader a very close up view of the war at the very pointed end of the spear. I could not put the book down until I finished the last page. Master Sergeant, US Army Retired, VN War 66-70 & 71-73."
3,Blackjack 34,"It was an interesting book but it concentrated on one battle only, so it became boring. Acording to the highlites page of other books he wrote, it sounds like Blackjack 33 might be more interesting."
2,Not much to it,"Book was about 200 pages too long. Unless you like page after page of ""we were walking through the stinking hot jungle""..."
5,Stands Out For Once,"Only one song got me hooked to this album like a fat kid to cake. This isn't an ordinary metalcore band. The band performs breakdowns that aren't just open C notes for a change, and the vocals tend to stand out. The opening to ""Listless"" is just catchy as hell, and ""I Do My Crosswords In Pen"" goes through time changes like no other. I recommend this over their new release, which is O.K., but doesn't even match to this underrated classic."
3,Decent stuff....Really bad dudes,"This album isn't really bad as far as modern metalcore goes. Nothing fantastic at all; a lot of the other people reviewing this album make it out like On Broken Wings is about to explode into something huge and amazing. That is really not true. Right now, they are as big as they can hope to ever be.Bottom line is, this stuff is okay. Nothing really original, but decent. However, I strongly advise against buying this. Get it somewhere else. Don't give your money to these jerks. Their shows are ridiculous and they are all about beating kids up. In Virginia Beach they annhilated half of the kids who came out to see them, and in exchange lost quite a few teeth. Some of the local kids nearly beat their roadie to death, and they all deserved what they got.In all, these guys are huge tools, and their music is nothing spectacular."
4,Pretty Descent Cd,"well in general this is a really good cd,i mean sure the screams are a bit screatchy but ull get that with almost any band.the best songs on here are giving up the ghost,i do my crosswords in pen,as you speak and maybe the earth is flat.yeah if u get into the hardcore/metalcore scene u would proaly like these guys,although right now as this band stands they seem to be more underground then most of the bands that are out there today.i reccomend it to anyone."
2,well...,"This is a band you hear good hype about. And then you listen, and you are vastly disappointed. This band is riding the Converge/Eighteen Visions/""noisy-hardcore"" trend. There is nothing special, because the vocalist sounds a good part like Jacob Bannon from Converge, and alot of the riffs sound like old Eighteen Visions. Skip this and wait for the new Madball or get the new Seventh Star cd."
1,Converge?,"Alright I am in agreeance that this CD is totally unoriginal and pretty much pointless but where do you get off comparing them to Converge? Converge is a completely different sound (technical, noisecore, etc.) I think you'd be better off just saying the usual troglodite comments we've come to except from this site such as ""this CD is gay"", ""this CD sucks"", etc. Please just leave the ""Converge rip-off"" comments out of here for they are deceiving. On Broken Wings sounds nothing at all like Converge. Period. They have more of a breakdown, breakdown, breakdown, bad melodic singing, breakdown, followed by a final breakdown sound to them. Bottom line: if you want to hear good music stear clear from this mess and stick to the likes of LFO, Harvey Danger, Wheatus, Dynamite Hack, etc. Peace."
1,Booooooring,"This is one of the most dull cds ive ever heard. Its so repetitive. I do my crosswords in pen is half decent aswell as the little rap Ashton Kutcher....., sorry Jonathan Blake, the singer, does at the end.I sold mine on ebay, i suggest you try and borrow it or burn it off a friend first.Plus, as im sure youve heard, they dont seem to be nice dudes. I know thats not to do with their music, but why give your money to jocks who like to bully people at shows?"
1,nothing new,On Broken Wings is nothing special. They sound like all the thousands of other metalcore bands that are out there. Dont waste your time or money on this cd.
4,Spring Training by Dan Shanghnessy and Grossfeld,"This book would make a fine reference for a class projecton baseball. Attractions from Florida to Arizona depictyoung rookies demonstrating their considerable skills. Thereis an excellent introduction called ""Renewal in Spring Training""by the legendary Cal Ripkind. Cal explains how the busy springseason brings together players with a job to do and rostersto write. The author explains that a visit to teams in springtraining provides the best opportunity to view players inclose proximity. This work is perfect for baseball enthusiasts."
3,Short and Sweet,"This is the kind of book a woman like my wife buys for a guy like me because I like baseball so she thought I'd like it. It's okay, full of pretty pictures that [take up] a couple of hours, but there's not much too it. I'd rather be at spring training than read about it. I also think she thought that since it was by Shaughnessy the book would be about the Red Sox, but it's not. Oh well."
4,Howard the hopeless romantic,"I have seen Howard in several Broadway shows and have always been impressedwith his intimate presence. He is such a tender and romantic performer; andall of these songs reflect that. I have uploaded the entire CD into my IPod,and always gently swoon when he comes on. What a great performer!"
5,EXCELLENT STRAINER,"This is the best strainer I have used for getting the food particles out of the cooking oil in my french fryer,when I empty the oil. The clean up is easy too. The food comes right out with a little hoy water."
2,Thumbs down on quality...,"While the digital photo album is a great idea this one lacks the resolution to display quality photos. If quality is a must for you then I wouldn't even consider this product. The resolution is only 320x240 dpi, regardless of the 640x480 dpi printed on the box, even for the Photo Album Plus (Kensington will tell you it is a misprint). There are wavy lines rolling across the pictures and one side of the screen is lighter than the other. Maybe this is why they are not selling these anymore... At least they are willing to give a full refund although you have to pay shipping costs so you still lose out."
2,No supporting documentation about its authenticity,"The bag is OK, although I don't like the handle. There was no supporting documentation to guarantee its authenticity so I wish I could just return it."
4,Worthwhile purchase,This book is a really useful resource for mothers to be or anyone interested in becoming a doula or knowing what a doula does and how one can be of assistance to a woman in labour.
1,turned me off to doulas,"This book turned me off to the whole idea of a doula. For financial reasons, I was unable to hire a doula but had heard they could be a big help and this book came highly recommended. I was hoping for a section on breathing or relaxation techniques. I came away with the feeling the authors felt no birth experience could be a success or enjoyable unless a doula was present. There was a very clear message that the father could not be a sufficient coach and his role was periphery to the doula. I was disappointed in the lack of encouragement the authors gave the father to be an active participant in the whole birth process or that the mother would lose control of herself if a doula was not present. It was almost a throw back to when my father had to fight to be at my birth and that was 30 years ago."
4,"Very informative, quick read","After seeing several references to Doulas in other pregnancy and childbirth books, I was curious about exactly what a Doula does and doesn't do. This book answered all my questions. It is well-oranged and easy to read -- I finished it in about 2 hours. The authors are certainly very pro-Doula, but I can't think of anything they're against, except mothers being forced to experience childbirth alone. I am likely to search for a Doula when I get pregnant.The only negative is the very 70's-ish photos, which I found a bit distracting, but they certainly don't detract from the content."
5,PURE GOLD,"WHAT A GREAT ALBUM. Alison Fraser is one of the theatre's most underrated perfomers. I first heard some cuts from this album a few months ago and anxiously anticipated it's release. What a wonderful selection of songs. Alison's interpretations are beautiful and moving. I guess I never really listened to the lyrics of ""The Beautiful Land"" from ""Roar of the Gresepaint..."" It's like I never heard the song before. I love this cd and highly recommend it to everyone."
1,Didn't last long.,"Just over a year old and no longer under warrenty, the answering function just quit and could not be fixed."
5,Prepare to cry,"I lost my mother when I was nine-years-old. I'm a 67 year-old-male. I'm thought of as friendly, well educated, somewhat intelligent, and vocationally successful. When my mother died, my life changed irrevocably. I am not the same person I would have become, had my beloved mother lived even a few more years.Hope Edelman's Letters from Motherless Daughters: Words of Courage, Grief, and Healing is exactly what the title says it is, words from women who lost their mothers at an early age and how it's impacted their lives.Much of what's written in the book is applicable to both men and women. For me, there were no answers; just an understanding that my sense of loss is shared by many others."
5,Extremely Helpful Book,I still flick through this book even after 7 years since my dear mum passed away. It was so helpful to read other womens stories and to realize my grief and absolute loss was perfectly normal. I bought another copy of this book when my friends mum passed away and hope she got out of it what i did.
4,Have kleenex with you,"I bought this book, as it hits close to home.It is written so beautifully and one can learn alot from this book"
5,Excellent!,Love this book to give to my girlfriends when they are grieving the loss of their mother. This transaction was excellent and fast.
4,"After all, it is only a screenplay-based novel...","Reviews are hard to write, so I'll make it short, sweet, and to-the-point.Daredevil is a good book for what it is: A screenplay-based novel. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list for books, but I wouldn't put it at the bottom either.This novel has more than the screenplay written. Daredevil has a sub-story which leads to the end of The Kingpin's assisstant.For anyone that doesn't want to see the movie, but is interested in what the story of the movie is, I reccommend it. If you have seen the movie and interested in how the author makes it into his own, I reccommend it. But, for anyone who is thinking about picking it up for a good read, I beyond all, DO NOT reccommend it."
2,Why did they even bother?,"The worst movie novelizations that I have read, and I have read alot. It didn't stay true to the movie screenplay. There was added scenes that were not in the movie. I got the book to read the movie (sorta' speek.)Overall: Don't bother!"
3,Worship LDR,"This CD is great, one of a kind and I must say that you will definitely be blessed and overwhelmed with the presence of God during this sacrifice unto the Lord. Judy, you are definitely a woman of God, anointed, and a woman of worship. She has managed to build on what she offered in ""Send Judah First"" and that is an awesome thing to achieve. ""Send Judah First"" and ""Raise the Praise"" are must haves for anyone who is serious about experiencing the presence of God in a real way in their everyday life."
2,If You Can't Say Anything Nice...,"Saints and Friends, somewhere there are true lovers of this new sound. Sadly I'm not one of them. With that said, all of you young'uns will love this CD. If you're an OG like me and you'd like to hear some foot-stompin somewhere in a Gospel CD, you won't find it here so save your money."
4,Not the best but solid,"This cd was influenced by the keyboard sound of the mid '80's. That being said, it applies that sound very nicely. The electric keyborad has come and gone from time to time in pop culture, however, this album does not sound dated because the songs are very solid. All of the early Petra albums are great anywayl."
4,It is Finished!,"This was the last album from Petra in which there was Greg X Volz in lead vocals. This was released in 1984. If you only know John Schlitt's voice, I encourage you to listen to this album. It is the easiest album from the Petra's first singer era. The song ""God Gave Rock And Roll to You"" is maybe the best-known song in this album but there's even better songs in the album: at least the title track, ""Computer Brains"", ""Adonai"", and ""It is Finished"". There's no bad songs at all - in my opinion. There's a funny 80's sound which is also in ""Back to the Street"" - the first album with John Schlitt. The song ""Adonai"" is a great closer. It's great that there is Christian music - like Petra.Stars: It Is Finsihed, Computer Brains, Beat the System"
3,What to think?,"""Beat the System,"" ""Adonai,"" and ""It Is Finished"" are some of Petra's best songs ever. Don't get me wrong--there are gems to be found in this CD. However, I think it stands among the low-points of Petra's Volz era. The sounds are eccentric, the songs are heavy-laden with tacky synthesizers and sound-effects, and there's not a whole lot to talk about here.On the plus side, Greg X. Volz's vocals are fiercer than ever on the ""It is Finished"" track. For the first time, that guy really let it all come out."
3,Ladybug letdown,"I purchased this tea set as a gift for a three year old girl who loves the ""Ladybug Girl"" book series. I coupled it with a few books and a ladybug costume, so the gift was a hit, but I wasn't thrilled with the tea set's quality. A few of the letters/ladybugs appeared to be chipping off, giving it a ""worn"" feel. When compared with some other brightly colored and fun tin tea sets I found later, I wish I had waited and purchased them instead. The porcelain is fragile for young fingers, too. There is also another ladybug tea set that comes in a clever picnic basket with a few more pieces (mini tablecloth, napkins and cutlery), which is ideal for keeping the tiny pieces together."
4,Flowered tray,This is a lovely and practical tray that I bought as a replacement for another Villeroy & Boch tray that had been broken. I was so pleased to be able to find something close to what I lost.
5,Train books for kids,"Wow. What a book. The detail, the pictures, the information, the color reproductions, + a CD. Just awesome. Wish I'd had this one when I wasof that age."
3,Train (DK Eyewitness Books),"The book is ok but the clip art disc was disappointing. Boring pictures of signals, antique clocktowers, suitcases, tickets and hardly any locomotive pictures or fun train pictures for kids to use on anything."
1,Read your printer manual first!,"I recently bought a new Epson printer which prints onto CD's. Unfortunately, I ordered these AquaGuard CD's before I was able to read the printer manual, which specifically states that the print head may be damaged if used with CD's with an AquaGuard surface. So, I went out and bought some Memorex CD's, which is one of several brands recommended by Epson for printing directly onto CD's. Otherwise, the AquaGuard CD's are fine for general use."
5,"So far, a very good product","I use the discs for transferring data from voice recordings to CD. My printer prints on the discs just fine. So far, I'm very happy with it."
4,Required Text,"This is a required book for my Master's class. It is insightful and compelling. I will keep it in my personal library, even after class has ended."
1,Corporate ClapTrap,"The story of American education is simple: the captains of industry unloaded the costs of training onto their serfs, and we pay for our own enslavement.Disgraceful indeed."
5,The best commentary on Ecclesiastes?,"Possibly the best commentary on Ecclesiastes commerciallyavailable.Very good scientific level, scholarly in contents, yeta very pleasant book to read.My favorite companion along Qohelet's wandering."
4,Great Dictionary,"An absolute must to have on your desk. Both dictionary and thesaurus, it comes in very handy every single day. The only problem is the binding. Pages tend to go their own way after awhile. Nevertheless, even with the loose pages, I haven't replaced my copy."
4,A Good Nightstand Addition,"My wife and I were looking for a ready reference for each reading area in our home so we bought three. That way, when reading if we came across a word or term with which we will not familiar we could readily look it up. Unfortunately, out of necessity, this pocket dictionary is abridged so that many obsolete or obscure words remain stumpers. Still, it is a good compromise between a true pocket reference book and an unabridged library dictionary. It is well-bound and easy to read and use. The thesaurus is a handy plus. Overall a good value."
5,"Very good dictionary, high quality paper","I've always preferred Oxford dictionaries. This one in particular has very high quality bright white paper instead of cheap, dark ones you would see on most books these days. Although it says ""pocket"", your pocket will have a tough time housing it. I'm very pleased and highly recommend this."
3,"Don't take the word ""pocket"" literally (like I did, lol)","I wanted to have a take-along dictionary for quick references and also a thesaurus, because I've begun experimenting with writing poems and songs on-the-go, so viola! A combination dictionary/thesaurus in pocket form - except none of my pockets are 7.9 x 5.3 x 1.7 inches(!). I never bothered to look at the product's dimensions. I've decided to keep it because it is a great dict./thes. combo. Although in retrospect, for my original intents and purposes, I wish I had noticed/gotten theOxford Mini Dictionary and Thesaurus (Dictionary/Thesaurus)."
2,dictionary,"While the size is better then a lage dictionary, most of the words I needed to look up were not in this dictionary. If you are looking for a good dictionary, go to one with more entries."
3,reasonable,"This book can not live up to my expectations, I hoped it would be a small one, while it's a little larger. Also, it's not good for me learning English as a second language!"
1,Zurna! What Zurna?,"The Zurna has been a favorite instrument of mine for decades. I will listen to any recording of this instrument I can. So I eagerly looked forward to receiving and then listening to this disc. If there was ever an example of false advertising, this is it! There was hardly any zurna sounds on this pathetic cd, and not until halfway through the disc. This crappy disc went straightway into the nearest trash receptacle. _It deserves a MINUS five (-5) rating!"
2,Jams waaaaay too much,"This is the first and last Xerox printer I buy. I have always bought HP printers in the past because I have had minimal trouble with them. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't care about ultra good print quality, doesn't care about ease of setup and doesn't care about uber speed. All I care about is that when I send something to the printer it FREAKING PRINTS. This printer fails far too often in that category."
3,This is not the current model,"The model being sold is from the first generation in appearence and the second generation in electronics. The difference between the two is the hard frame between the ear pieces which becomes a wire in the second, giving a modern 767 airline feel to the headset. I prefer the hard frame so the fact I got a first generation headset was OK. The second generation electronics had me going to the website to get the latest codes for the LED. There seems to be some issues with the microphone and scatternet. Since I don't try to answer phone calls while listening to audio those are non-issues to me."
1,Never worked for me,"I own BSH-100 for three years, and I was never able to use it as a stereo headset (I tried two different PCs, a PDA and laptop). It worked a couple of times as a phone, which I don't need. I even exchanged my device at Anycom, the new one didn't work."
2,Too much Static and Noise,I bought this primarily planning to use it as a headphone with my laptop. There is lo of static noice and clearly the music quality is very poor.
4,Jade steals the show,"jade was a regular presence in the first season of the show, but she gets even more face time here. Though I did enjoy this episode, it was just one of many which featured Jade as almost more of a main character than Jackie (even though the show is called JACKIE Chan Adventures!) Still, she was funny here, and the little stunt she pulled with a magic spell to try to avoid homework just blows up in her face. Fortunately, it does come in handy for dealing with the Mountain Demon. Overall good episode."
1,Wrong video,"Please note the wrong video file is linked to Demon in Di-skies. The actual video you will receive is ""Queen of the Shadowkhan"" which is episode 6 rather thn 9. Amazon support has been notified."
5,One More Thing!!!,"I have literally been checking on Amazon for years in hopes of one day finding this amazing series available in complete seasons. And finally, my prayers have been answered- there is something about this series that just hooks you in. The characters are memorable and hilarious, (Uncle, Jade, Tohru, etc.) and the adventure feel to the show is contagious.I don't want to spoil much, but you definitely should buy this show. This is what made waking up early Saturday mornings so worth it. Shows like Jackie Chan Adventures- Just hope that Sony will release seasons 1, 3, and 4 soon. (Season 5 was horrible...)BUY THIS!"
5,Why no DVD box set?,"My wife and I love this series! The wise, no-nonsense Uncle is definitely our favorite character. And the second season is extra long - woo-hoo!"
4,silly episode,"But a rather enjoyable one, as Jade and Jackie go to England to investigate the disappearance of Stonehenge. They inadvertently cross paths with a secret society that is a parody of the Illuminati. The writing here is fairly enjoyable even if the episode was a bit simplistic. I am not quite sure why Season 2 had so many episodes, more time could have been spent on some of them and saved for later seasons."
4,Too bad this villian didn't come back...,"This was a fun episode with a cool villain I wish had come back for another appearance. Overall it's a fun episode with some comedic scenes and nice action scenes, showcasing some of the best of Season 2's abilities. A shame Origani wasn't used again or developed further."
4,Cute episode,"This episode was not one of the best, but it is not without its good moments. The character of that snooty young explorer and their butler as they tag along with Jackie and Jade is funny. In some episodes I found Jade to be annoying but in this one it fits well, her character was a needed part of this episode. It ends nicely, so all's well ends well."
4,lol,"This episode was rather funny, and showed a bit of Tohru's past. The fighting between Uncle and Mama Tohru were also funny, but it doesn't really explain how Tohru ended up with Valmont since she is very sweet to him. Still, the episode itself had some great dialogue and action, and this is a solid episode."
4,So mcuh potential,"This episode was a lot of fun, but it also had so much unused potential. A small group of monks come to Tohru, thinking he is the Chosen One, and that leads to him being targeted by the villian. However, it is revealed that the real Chosen One is someone else - and the writers could have made a different (and better) decision than this. Also, what is explored in this episode is never brought up again, which wasted a chance to explore a cool idea."
4,Fun episode,"Mama Tohru comes back - great to see more exposure for one-shot characters - and even on a cruise ship, Uncle and Mama Tohru cannot stop sniping at one another, but eventually they realize they can work like a team, Fun episode if you like seeing Uncle and Mama Tohru fighting."
3,Eh,"This was not the best episode, but it was not the worst either. It is also Jade-centered, with Jade befriending a young king who has never experienced a normal life. It's almost a parody of the situation, and though there were a few entertaining bits, this episode could and should have been something different and better."
2,Should last more than a few months!,"I've had this telephone for five months and the cordless phone is no longer working. That is not a very long life, especially considering the cost. Regarding the answering machine, when people hang up before the message is finished, I hear a telephone company recorded message saying that they have dialed the wrong number (or a message similar to that)..it repeats a few times with their beeping noise before it actually turns off, and it is very annoying. No other message machine has ever done this. I really liked the idea of the corded phone as well as the cordless with this model, but I should have listened to the salesmen when they told me Sony cordless phones are returned more than other ones. I didn't because when it comes to cordless phones, I haven't had much better luck with Panasonic or Uniden."
2,Hurts to see all the typos and mistakes.,"As a native speaker of Russian, I thought the book was nothing else, but an insult. Good stories. Would be interesting to read for learners of Russian. They could even benefit from it in terms of grammar, spelling and punctuation if...it didn't have a great deal of typos and mistakes. As if it was not proofread for spelling, grammar or punctuation at all. Would I recommend it for my students? No! Good-looking cover and the pictures, but the way the stories are put onto the paper - it's just a shame. I wouldn't complain, if I got it for free, but spending $10 on it was a waste."
5,Great Intermediate Level Stories,"These stories are fun and help you learn to read Russian, without being too difficult. There is plenty of new vocabulary, with explanatory notes. In addition, there is some cultural material, with a glimpse of life in modern Russia, such as the story of a family living in a communal apartment in St. Petersburg. The most interesting one was a true story of a polar bear cub taken to live with a family in Siberia, encompassing ecological concerns and the life of Russians working in the far north."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"After months of trying to deal with how terrible these pencils are, I finally threw them all away.They are impossible to sharpen because the lead is broken inside the wood shaft. The wood shaft on half of them was brittle and would splinter upon attempt to sharpen.I tried several sharpeners thinking the blade might be dull. All sharpeners produced the same result so I decided to try a variety of other pencils, standard and colored. All sharpened perfectly.Bottom line is unless you love activities of futility, get another, any other, colored pencil."
5,Excellent price for pencils,"I bought this when it was under $6. That's about the cheapest you will ever find it! I bought a couple sets for my art classroom, since they have been used to using the same old 12 color sets. Its nice to have some tertiary colors and more neutral colors for them to use. Thanks amazon!"
5,Colored pencils,"Just what you'd expect: 50 Crayola Colored Pencils. All were intact on arrival (I expected some to be broken during shipping), and they have served my periodic coloring purposes well."
3,Not bad if you can sharpen them....,"The good:These pencils come in a wide range of colours giving a pretty good coverage.They are also cheapThe bad:Very,very difficult to sharpen with a normal hand held pencil sharpener making them almost useless....HOWEVER..I bought a mechanical pencil sharpener, the type that hold the pencils in a ""jaw"" and you turn a handle to sharpen. Seems to do the trick! Now I get a long pointed pencil that is quite useable."
1,"Lead Broken inside both boxes of pencils, unable to sharpen","I ordered colored pencils because I couldn't find them overseas (military) at the beginning of the school year. The shipping time was great, but the quality is lousy. Not sure if the damage occcurred with shipping or with the product, suffice to say that it isn't worth $6 in shipping to return $12 in pencils. My children, who usually don't complain, were both mad because the lead kept breaking when they sharpened the pencils and they had to throw several out. Either the quality is lousy or the packaging was a bad idea (they were not protected in any way, just directly wrapped with a cardboard box that matched in size of the two boxes ordered). The pencils themselves were not broken. Mad at myself for wasting my money."
1,Horrible quality on these coloring pencils,"All the color pencils are broken inside, my daughter could not color with them at all. The tip comes off right away.You can sharpen the pencil all you want, but the tip comes off intermediately."
2,Brittle!,"We bought these for my 6 year old son who loves to color. He loves markers, but his 2 year old brother was a bit too enthusiastic with them on my furniture, so we've got the pencils instead.The colors are great, but the quality is atrocious. You need to sharpen them every few minutes (if you want a decent job), but they are so brittle I keep dumping broken tips. The only good way to sharpen them is by using a sharp blade, but it's time-consuming and not exactly safe with 2 active boys roaming around. We have a box of cheap pencils my husband got in some airport in Europe couple of years ago and they still have some juice (OK, lead) left in them! The Crayola won't last more than a couple of month for color-happy user!"
3,Beautiful but......,"I love Villeroy & Boch's Cottage pattern, which is why I decided on getting this kettle over other similar ones. Like the previous reviewer said, it is very beautiful and fits into most decor. You have to be careful in maintaining it though; the instructions say to thoroughly dry the kettle as soon as you're done to avoid rust in the interior (a hassle if you ask me). Also, my major gripe is that the spout drips when pouring --- a dangerous thing since we're dealing with boiling water. All in all, it's an okay kettle, not greatly designed. I will probably keep it just because it looks nice on my stovetop. But my quest for the perfect teakettle continues!"
4,Beautiful But Small,"This teapot is gorgeous. It's one of the prettiest I've ever owned. It looks so good on the stove that you feel it should be on display somewhereelse. It is smaller than the teapots I usually own but for something thisbeautiful, I've kept it and am using it just fine."
2,Not as advertised,"This teakettle is every bit as pretty as it looks in the picture, but it's not 2.5 quarts as described. It's a 2-quart kettle, which it states on the box. If it's important to you to have the extra capacity, look elsewhere. I'm trying to decide whether to return it."
5,satisfied,I submitted a review of the seller which I now rescind! He has made numerous attempts to explain the mix up and has given me a full refund. This was truly an honest mistake.
3,MAJESTIC BUT MONOTONOUS,"A friend of mine listened to this on the internet sampler after listening to Sinatra's'Have a Jolly Christmas.' She is a devout Christian unfamiliar with either Sinatra or Gordon Macrae's efforts in the service of this type of music. Sinatra she found brought her to a peaceful place where she wanted to remain. She found Macrae to be majestic at first but then said it all sounds the same. 'The other (Sinatra) was more varied (in tempo and dynamics.)' Yes, Gordon has a rich, wide baritone. It reminds me of what Sinatra said when he introduced Robert Goulet at a benefit. 'This guy's got a voice that's wider than Sophie Tucker's _ _ _.' Sinatra himself tried to find the most expressive timber, inflection and tempo with which to offer what he believed the lyricist intended even if it meant deviating from the staid, stilted traditional delivery."
3,Just OK!,I would agree with some of the others and say that the background took away from his singing and made the recording so.so. I would not recomend this one when he has some great ones out there.
3,What are the track listings on this thing?,Why should this cd be purchased if the tracks are not listed?
4,its okay...,"the media that the package comes with is pretty easy to work, and the installation process is a breeze. but the mp3 player itself is kind of clunky, and its bigger than the picture depicts it to be. the 16 mb of memory in its internal memory will only hold about 15-20 minutes worth of music (but it also depends on the bit rate you choose). so if you're going to take it on the go, i recommend buying a multimedia card to upgrade the unit to 32 or even 64 mb of memory. overall, there are better mp3 players out there, but if you want the basics, then get this one, its very user friendly."
3,It's Okayyy....,"This product is just alright. It is not too good or too bad, it is just there. But I must warn you that if you do buy it you should have some knowledge on mp3 players because the instructions could be better, and you should get another set of headphones to go with it because the ones they give you are'nt good. Unless you only want to have a few songs at a time, dont get this."
4,Fun Beginning for MP3 s,"I bought this because it was ... on sale. Software loaded easily. I'm not sure why people are complaining about the loudness because it's quite good at a 50 rating for me and I mainly use it when I'm driving a convertible with a lot of wind noise. It eats batteries but no worse than my CD player. It's pretty much what I expected for the price. Oh, get a memory card. 16 meg just isn't enough for any serious listening. ..."
2,"Gritty, Grainy, and Gross!","I used this book twice and then shelved it. The first time I tried making vanilla cashew ice cream it came out very grainy and not like ice cream at all. The second time I decided to soak the cashews overnight, even though the book does not tell you to. This helped some, but the ice cream was still gritty and and grainy and it did not melt like ice cream or soy ice cream. It ended up being a huge waste of money because we threw the ice cream in the compost both times. Maybe you need to have a Vitamix or equally expensive blender or food processor to get the right consistency. I wish it had said that somewhere."
1,Tasted gritty,"I ground those cashews for well over the one minute time he recomended, and no matter how much i did it it tasted gritty. I'm surprised at all the 5 star reviews."
3,Gourmet Desserts - Gourmet Prices,"As a vegan, I love to find dessert recipes that I can eat. Vice Cream has over 70 yummy desserts that I can indulge in. Now, the recipes may sound great and I prefer to have all natural food when I can but most of the recipes will end up costing a small fortune to make. Not only that but a lot of the ingredients cannot be found in your local grocery store. It's a handy book to have when I feel like treating myself but these aren't recipes I'd make all the time...unless I inherited a lot of money."
3,Good for ideas...,"The use of raw cashew milk in almost every recipe seems limiting. However, I've subsitiuted with other milks such as soy and almond."
5,"Finally, a good dairy-free substitute for homemade ice cream","I have only made two of the types so far, raspberry and chocolate. I have a nice, normal household blender and had no problem pureeing the cashews in water well enough to get them smooth.The vice cream is smooth, rich and creamy, with a nice balance of flavor. Too bad summer's over!"
2,"Amusing reading, not to deep","The company is a fun little book for someone who wishes to understand the contribution of such entities to the creation of wealth in the modern world. It is not a thesis and it doesn't pretend to be one. It is basically a recollection of historical data starting from the fenician merchants and ending with the current anti globalization movement. However, beside the historical data and some insight into the views of the authors, the book doesn't ellaborate to much into any particular thesis. It is not a pertentious book but a fun one to read on a weekend."
3,simple and brief,quick read on the history of the firm in general. recounts milestones and significant events as well as some interesting anecdotes of which many would be known to the general historian and some more that may not. i was expecting more analysis but given the quality of the data (that was extremely well-cited in terms of sources) its a very good value.
1,Noche oscura,"I ordered the book in Spanish, paperback. I got a book in English, hardback. It took 3 weeks to get the wrong book, correct book never arrived."
3,Product good - shipping not,"This product is really good to keep your mood balanced, however the supplier just wrapped it in brown paper and shipped it in a lightly padded envelope. We had to pick the pills out of the glass bottle and put them in another container."
1,did not work and not as advertised,"I purchased two of these cartridges, supposedly in 'retail packaging' for my wife's Officejet printer.They arrived not in retail packaging but in just the white inner cardboard that you find ina real HP box. The HP outer box you see in a retail store and in the picture above was completely missing. The product listing on Amazon is very misleading.One printed only red and the other printed only black. We followed all instructions for installing and calibrating these cartridges. I don't know if they are poor refills or if they are so old the ink has dried up.I was most disappointed by the fact that Amazon fulfilled the order with such poor quality goods. I usually trust products fulfilled by Amazon, but in this case both they and the original vendor let me down and embarrassed me.I am returning these and will seek cartridges elsewhere"
1,Don't waste your money,"The color ink cartridge in ""Retail Packaging"" came in a grey plastic bag with a label that stated ""Retail Packaging."" No box, just the cartridge and the sealed bag. In attempting to print in color, no color appeared on the page other than black."
4,Good Enough,"When I got this CD in my hands, I thought that this would be one of the greatest CDs ever made. However, there IS great songs, many great songs, such as ""In the Kingdom"", ""No Second Changes"", ""In His Hands"", ""Holy War"", and ""If He Goes Before Me"". Also ""Good Enough"", ""We Know What's Right"" and the guitar solo ""The Eternal Fire"" are quite great ones. But then there's also three poor tracks ""You Will Find It There"", ""Love Is Our Weapon"", and especially ""Tell Me The Time"" which aren't for my taste. Also the two rap sections in ""Holy War"" are strange - especially because I hate rap - but still it's a great song with great vocal power.Stars: In the Kingdom, No Second Chances, Holy War"
4,Whitecross Rocks!,"Great CD! Great band! Not as edgy as their earlier stuff, but still a solid 80s metal album! If you like Ratt, you will like this!"
2,Not music,"Unfortunately, this is a summary of the life of Beethoven and some of his best known works with excerpts inserted in the spoken narrative. I expected to be able to listen to music, not the biography of Beethoven, as it was purchased for very young children who would not be interested (at their age) in his life history."
5,Just Beautiful!,"This was the first time I have purchased one from this series and I can only regret it took me so long. I bought the CD for my children and have loved every minute right along with them. It brings Beethoven and his music gloriously alive to young and old alike. Get this CD, you will never regret it."
5,Simply wonderful,"I bought this as an intro to classical music for my kids and it is superb. This volume happens to be my favorite of the series. The music characterizes the emotions of the characters and the setting perfectly and contains an equal blend of music and narration. We listen to this CD as we are drifting off to sleep and I am often the only one lying awake to hear the end. I believe this to be a high quality product so much that I have checked out the others in this series, but have found none so good as this one."
3,Nice but not great,"Not quite sure why other people love this so much. Our son who's listened to this on and off for a few months now (21 mo. currently) isn't so enthralled by this as the other reviewer's children seem to be. He pretty much ignores this and continues to do whatever he was doing in the car.For myself, initially I didn't think much of this at all and preferred just a regular classical CD but it does grow on you after a while - maybe it'll grow on our son too as he gets older.They did pick nice pieces though, the story is nice enough and the performance of the actors were good. Be forewarned though, it does mention death of Beethoven."
5,Barker's crazy imagination!,"I came upon the books of blood recently. I read it like 10 years ago and was really entertaingly disturbed. I think some of the short stories are classics that set imagination realms for other reader to follow. ( I noticed a couple of barker influences in Akmal Shebl's The Human Effect, and even the latest Gailamn) I don't mean any harm by this. But like Dracula is the inspiration of all time Vampire bestsellers. Barker is an inspiration for a horror and gleemly enlightened fantastique worlds.The Books of Blood is like reading 10 bestseller horro books. Every story is original and steeping into gore. I like the story about the vegetarian woman the best, the train at the end of new york city. Hail Barker who doesn't write as sharp as this anymore these days."
2,Strange and not in an enteraining way,"I purchased this upon the reviews which I had read about this book. Having been a H.P. Lovecraft fan almost since I could read and reading favorable comparisons between Barker's work and Lovecraft I expected more of a comparison. However, I was highly disappointed. Read some of his works in an anthology before you buy this book. I cannot recommend this particular work of his."
4,A Bazaar of the Bizare,"Barker is a very different horror-writer, than the more commercial succesful writers like King or Koontz. His writing is much more unnerving and surreal than his more popular colleagues.His work is another world, a world of grotesque and twisted minds and bodies, a world of incredible depravity and senseles pleasure. It is certainly an aquired taste, and not for everyone. To some people it is simply too much.The Books of Blood vol. 1-3 covers a wide range of depravity from ritual murder over cannibalism and to vengeful spirits.But the grotesque imagery is also what is attractive about the book. Like a carwreck, you want to turn away, but you can't.I think I can best describe barker as a mix between H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar A. Poe. A very, very unsettling combination to be sure. Books of Blood is definately not recomended for the faint of heart or as a bedtime story"
5,As close to literary genius as you can get.,"The Books of Blood were my introduction to the works of Clive Barker, and I can only bow to his genius. The collection of stories in the Books of Blood demonstrate the depth of his imagination that is rivalled by none in his field, and the fantastic merging of (get ready for the cliche) reality and fantasy. Tales like 'In the Hills - the cities' antaognise deeply buried primal fears, and drag them kicking and screaming into consciousness.By these volumes, your literary life won't be the same without them.Pity he has to make the films though. Candyman ? Hellraiser 4 ? Give me a break."
4,"Good prose, graphiclly frightening","Sometimes I wonder why I read Barker's work. It is just too heavy for me at times, and often after reading a story or two I feel physically ill. Barker's prose is very good, more artistic poetry than real poetry, and his scenes are so close to home they are graphically frightening. In my opinion, he is the best, bar none, for stimulating horror fiction."
5,Rawhead Rex Rules,"I agree with ""Stunning"" Rawhead Rex is the best monster story ever written! Too bad they made it a movie. I love most of the stories as well. RR is enough for me to recommend the book. Mr. Barker ropes you in to his graphic writing."
4,Very well written and completly enjoyable,"This is the first Clive Barker book I've ever read, but I enjoyed completly. Mr. Barker has a way of getting to your fears you didn't even know you had."
3,Very Over rated,"This is a pretty good book. But none of the stories are all that great. Clive Barker is also not a very scarry writer. None of the stories really scared me.There are some good stories in this book, and a few of them are Really Good. But IMO most of them are mediocre. This book is very over rated."
2,Overrated,"I'm not big horror reader these days, but I used to read Stephen King, and always liked the darker fantasy stuff, not to mention all the splatter movies we used to watch in high school, so I wouldn't say I'm adverse to it. Barker has been widely hailed as ""the future of horror,"" so I figured I'd take a gander at this collection of 16 stories originally published in 1984, to see what all the fuss what about. Well, maybe I'm just jaded or am too grounded to reality, but I found the seven stories I read to be fairly boring. There's plenty of blood, but nothing I found particularly shocking or scary. There are good premises here and there, but somewhat haphazard execution--which Barker himself obliquely acknowledges in his introduction."
3,Check it out at the library,"This book was not great or even that good. There is nothing significant that will stand out other than the story about the giant made of human bodies. Another turn off in the book is the persuance of homosexuality. It also seems to me that Barker tries to write like a new-age Poe, which isn't bad if you can blend modern English and Old English without pouring out too much of either. There is one more point that seems disturbing and that is Mr. Barker's use of vocabulary, which is ostentatious."
5,Brillant,"The first volume of the books of blood is the best of the series. The stories in this book are highly imaginative and, off course, quite graphic. The story ""In the Hills, the Cities"" is one of the most daring and fascinating short pieces of work you'll read in a long time.."
4,The Implicit becomes the Explicit,"In all the best horror there is a strong undercurrent of perversity, of the repressed, unacceptable desires that afflict everyone in a civilized society. The most salient feature of Barker's fiction is that he takes this element that frequently remains only implied in much of the horror tradition and places it right on the surface.The Books of Blood are a good introduction to Barker's work."
5,The Book That Began My Favorite Series,"Jodi Foster was your average Jane. A third grade school teacher with a husband and two kids. Little did she know that attending a women's prayer conference would lead to her making twelve lifelong friends of different ages, ethnic and religious backgrounds.The faith and compassion of the women in this book makes you want to jump in and join the group. It reminds you of the importance of prayer and even when you're not reading the book, your first reaction to incidents in life may very well be prayer thanks to this book. By the end you'll be eager to read the next book, and the next and the next..."
4,A check yourself read,This book was good from the beginning to the very end. I had no idea that the story would take a major near the end. I was so inspired by the many scriptures that were highlighted throughout the book. This is a good christian novel that will help any christian along the way.
4,Yada Yada,"I enjoyed this book and although I want to read more from the series, I am not eager to jump right in. I was able to put this one down without regret and ""dying"" for more, but like I said, it was good for what it was."
2,Too long for the point,"I see I am in the minority, but I didn't like this book much. Other than one person trying to find her daughter and mild discusstions of racial issues, nothing really happens until the last few chapters. I thought the characters were not very well developed. The author hints at their issues, but never really tackles them. She seems to bring up lots of issues and then fizzles. I think this book could have really made a difference to non-bleivers reading it, but instead Jodi seems so shocked by her imperfections and those in others that it comes across as very pious - especially the arguments with the husband. I was really dissappointed."
2,The Yada Yada Prayer Group,There should definitely be a better description of what a mass-market paperback is. I would never had ordered this if I had known that it was going to be such small print!! The other 2 books in this series that I ordered are easy to hold with larger print. This one is awful! There was nothing on the order page that described this difference and I am very disappointed!
1,do not trust them,have yet to recieve my book that I ordered over a month ago on Nov. 19 and it is Dec. 23. And they do not provide tracking information. You might want to consider that before you choose to place an order with them. I am extremely dissapointed.
4,The Yada Yada Prayer Group,"If you have always attended church, been a ""good Christian girl"", don't have a prejudice bone in your body and thought you knew what it meant to have a servant's heart, read this book. I couldn't put it down. Each day I anxiously anticipated the quiet moments when I could catch up with the Yada Yada sisters. Their lives will influence you to look at your world as God's world. It inspired and informed me about the cultures outside my church walls. I suggest you order all in the series because when you finish one, you'll want to continue the your connection with the Yada Yada sisters. Neta Jackson has provided the perfect vehicle for opening our hearts and minds to the struggles, fears and victories of our sisters in this world."
2,yada yada blah blah blah...,"One of my best friends gave me this book, and she usually has great suggestions, so I was excited to read it. However, even a couple chapters in, I was ready to slap Jodi, and I only got more annoyed as the story went on. She was the most shallow, jealous, snotty character in any book I've ever read. Sure, all characters have flaws. But Jodi seemed to have every flaw. Any character in the book that Jodi didn't like or made a snide comment about in her head made me like her less and the other person more. By the time I was halfway through the book, I was on everyone's side but Jodi's. And that is not something you want in a main character.I did enjoy some of the plot, and the camaraderie that the members of the prayer club had together. But I'm certainly not going to be looking for these books in the store. If I can't feel sympathy for the narrator and main character of the story, then as a reader, you've totally lost me."
5,I can't say enough,"I came across this book by chance, but it and the rest that follow have become among my favorites books. I always have two of book #1 on hand to give as gifts. I have probably given away 10 already. Why? For most Chritian women, I think Jodi is a character who can be identified with. I felt as if Jodi has become a real literary friend. Also, this series of books has taught me not too be judgmental about other donominations. With the variety of characters in the book, I was exposed to not only other wonderful Christian characters but the churches they attend. The series is only 7 books, and I don't want to see it end."
5,AWESOME,I bought this book after reading an article in Today's Christian Woman - it is such an easy read - something I needed being a working mother with two young children - I got hooked. I ordered all of them and even pre-order the last one. The characters are like friends and you get so involved in their lives. I have even started a Yada Yada group at my church - we discuss the books but also are able to share with each other about our life experiences. The group is very successful and the ladies really enjoy our time together. This series is one that every woman should own!
5,Must read for all Christian women,"I love this book. It is interesting and uplifting. Every Christian woman should read this book. It is about women and their lives, families, successes, failures, tears and laughter. Every woman will find herself in one of the characters of this book. This book will inspire you in your Christian walk. It may be fiction, but it is filled with truth."
4,A Perfect Primer,"Though I played in a Dark Ages chronicle, it was years ago and I wasn't running it. I wanted to see how the ""pros"" did it rather than learn on my own (the hard way), so I picked up this book.A good story that will let you shape it to what you want it to be, I've found it the best way to get started in the Dark Ages (both from a Storytelling and a character creation standpoint)."
4,Execellent Start to a Long Journey,This is an excellent book to start with if you are just starting out as a story teller. Has all possibliltes already planned out for you and has nasty little turn abouts in it to keep players on their toes. One thing it lacked was some tiny details about some characters that would have been useful.
1,not a good one to buy,"i purchased this thermostat and have had many issues with my air conditioning. i had to call a technician and spend my money to help troubleshoot the manufacturing defects in the unit that was shipped. i have to give credit to amazon customer service, they shipped me a replacement unit asap. but the issue is now my air conditioning will not shut off. the compressor runs all day long even after the temp has been achieved. i think honeywell goofed up on this unit. i had to go back to my non-programmable unit just to keep the house cool/warm without blowing up my hvac system."
3,good but no back lite,"good and simple, but the fact that it's not back lite kills this for me, I'm returning it. the screen is not that informative, hard to tell which stage is currently running (tho you should know if you programed it). there's a cover the opens which house the rest of the buttons beside for the 2arrows, the cover is not hinged."
2,spend a little more,"We inherited this thermostat in our new house. We previously had one of the 7d programmable Honeywells. This one is a huge step down. The temperature swings drastically past the setpoint, both up and down. It's difficult to program. You have to pop the cover plate off to make any adjustments other than a quick up/down. We also miss the target feature where it learns the time your house takes to get to the setpoint and compensates.This one will get banished to the garage shortly and we'll be investing in one of the better Honeywells. I'd suggest that you skip this one and either save your money on a basic model or spend a little more on the better units, especially if you value maintaining a constant temperature."
1,Worked good for less then 48 hours,I installed this unit around 8:pm Friday night by 11:pm Saturday the heat would not turn off automatically. The setpoint is set at 72 degrees. The heating unit was still running after the room temp hit 80 degrees. The unit was given to me after a friends installer said it was not a good unit. I should have taken that advice.
3,"Works OK, but there are better choices","Easy to install and works well enough, but the ergonomics are a little crufty (press two buttons *exactly* at the same time kind of stuff). You also have to remove a flimsy plastic non-hinged cover to change the setback times/temps, and that'll surely get lost or broken someday. I prefer the Lux units (TX500 or TX1500) in this price range."
4,Easy to program,"I got this programmable thermostat to save money. I have a very variable schedule so the weekday/weekend programming didn't really work for me. But it was easy to do! If I worked a regular 9-5 this would be perfect. Otherwise, it is just a digital thermostat to me. I like it so far."
4,Pretty good for the price,Haven't had it very long. but works fine and was really easy to program and install.
4,Great product for the money,"I was impressed by the options available in this unit. Installation was a snap and the readout is very easy to understand. It did take a few weeks of tweaking to get the times and temperatures correct, and the unit gave no indication if your program overlapped (I had confused AM with PM for part of it). If I had to buy another, I would probably opt for something with a backlight, however, or really splurge and get a Nest. For the money, this is an excellent unit."
4,Great thermostat--lousy installation directions,"I installed this thermostat to control a gas furnace, following the wiring instructions. The instructions said to remove the jumper wire in the connection terminal if you had a two-wire control circuit. I did as instructed; the furnace came on but would not quit. After I played with the unit for several hours, my wife checked the Honeywell website, and finally found that the instructions there said that the jumper was mandatory for proper operation if you had a single transformer and a two wire system. I put the jumper back on and the thermostat has worked flawlessly since. The thermostat works really well, but the directions stink."
2,Cheap. You get what you pay for.,"I picked up this 5/2 Honeywell thermostat because it was about $10 cheaper than a White Rogers version (that I had at my old house and liked). I figured, what could be so different? Well, a lot.1)the cover is not hinged, so for 'fiddlers' who like to change settings, it's a total pain to pop it open and get inside to adjust programs. You are able to adjust temperature temporarily without opening the Honeywell cover, but it eventually reverts to the program. .2) no backlight3) battery consumption, for some reason, is really high. My first set of fresh duracell AA's went out after 6 months4) non-intuitive displayI could provide a lot more detail but the bottom line is if you're the type of person who is constantly checking your thermostat and likes to adjust programs frequently, look elsewhere. I don't know the model number but there's a 5/2 White Rogers with a swing down cover that works great - spend the extra $10 on that one."
1,bad electronics,3 out of 7 of these failed in 3 years or less.the logic malfunctioned in various ways and the units would not control as designed.when they did work they worked well.
2,prefer a different brand,"I found the instructions confusing at the most key part, ie, where to insert the wires, and where the J-switch goes. The screen doesn't light up which is a pain when trying to check temperature or change settings at night. You have to take the cover off to change settings, the cover doesn't flip. The screws were difficult to access with a standard Phillips head, down in narrow channels. You have to toggle between one display to see actual temperature vs set temperature, instead of being able to see both at once. I'm frustrated enough that I'm going to switch to a Lux model which I'd installed before and loved."
2,No better than the worst programmable thermostat I've purchased,"... And I've purchased and installed several in various homes/apts. Installation wasn't any better or worse than others, but this one... I couldn't even get access to the controls without pulling out my toolbox! ARGH!!!!As for doing its job... It was fine for AC, but now that I need the central heating to work, this thermostat isn't!"
3,OK Thermostat,"No light, if you try to change the temp at night good luck, screen does not light up. So, you are going to take a few wxtra step to turn on a light switch. Installation was not simple. Diagram chart is pretty basic. But overall when it is hooked up, it works pretty well"
3,"AS Advertised, but requires Batteries",Everything works exactly as advertised but I understand there are other programmables that do not require freguent changing of batteries--a bit of a pain.
2,Very difficult to replace the batteries,"I was very pleased with the ease of installation and operation. After the first winter, the batteries started to go dead. It was next to impossible to pull them out. I had to use a screwdriver to pry them out. (there are small plastic bars that hold them in)After doing so, the metal contacts became loose, and twice the device lost power while in the 'on' mode. We came home to a house in the mid-80's both times, costing us about 8 times the price of this device in heating bills.The operations engineer did a great job. The design engineer did not."
1,Unreliable: Careless design,"Does not trigger the heater or air-conditioner at the set temperatures. Isn't this the most basic functionality for a thermostat? The temperature sensor seems to work OK and displays the correct temperature, but the control logic fails to turn on the HVAC system 1-2% of the time....very disappointing product from a reputable company. Into the trash it goes, as soon as I receive a different thermostat from Amazon"
1,Failed After 18 months,Easy installation and worked well - until it failed. From reading other reviews this seems to be a common problem. Another case of a cheap Chinese product branded by an established US manufacturer.
1,Poor value and DOA,"I ordered this to replace a manual thermostat. What should have been a simple install turned into a very cold overnight ordeal. Instructions included are very weak and do not include crucial diagrams. After 3 calls to the Honeywell help line, I was informed I had a defective unit and needed to return it. A trip to HD proved helpful. I got an upgraded unit (also Honeywell) with backlight for $24.99. In addition, the setup and instructions were much more user friendly. I would NOT recommend this particular model."
4,Wiring can be tricky,"I bought this after our county started giving $25 rebates toward programmable thermostats. My old digital (carrier) non-programmable thermostat had 5 wires. I hooked this one up with all 5 wires but found the A/C would not turn on, even after the 5 minute warm up. After reading an Amazon reviewer having a similar problem, I reinserted the RC/Rh jumper and disconnected the blue wire, taping it off with electrical tape. Works perfectly now! This is day two and I am experimenting with the default program mode, which is working fine.I was also worried because the package said it does not work for multi-stage systems. I have a high efficiency gas furnace that is two stage, and it is working normally with this thermostat."
3,"Works well, needs to have a lighted display",Product was easy to install and program. What would make this product perfect would be to have a lighted screen. If you want to see the settings at night you have to turn a light on.
2,Progressively worsening...,"I've had this thermostat for about three years and now I'm shopping to replace it. We have never used any of the advanced features but only for on/off heating and cooling to a certain fixed temp. It worked decently the first two years, even though the batteries were sucked dry many times (and a real pain to replace). This last year the temps were inconsistent and now it's reading ambient temps way too high. Lame. No more honeywells, I guess."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!,"I bought this thermostat because of the Honeywell reputation and it was featured at Lowes where I made the purchase. I originally thought the flexibility of the functions would also be helpful. I couldn't be more wrong!! This thermostat really SUCKS! It's difficult to program and the instructions are not intuitive. The cover to access the programs is very difficult to remove and requires a tool to do so. It was truly a waste of money, and I have decided to throw it out and purchase something better... don't waste your money or time with this product!!"
4,Dandy Thermostat,A decent programmable thermostat. It was just a bit more complex to install than a basic unit. It comes pre-programmed so it's a snap to get up and running. It's just fine.
4,One more patronizing MD.,"I knew the Doctor & I were at odds when he put ""lifestyle"" in quotes. To paraphrase the author: We've survived so many threats to our existance, surely we're evolved enough to not worry about trivial lifestyle details like organic food,pure water, & clean air. Thank you Doc, for a clear,concise expression of the AMA's stance"": ""Don't waste your time w/'lifestyle' choices, we have medicine & surgery for you""."
3,Provocative - but read with a grain of salt,"This is an original and provocative view of the failings of modern medicine that I would recommend to anyone in the profession. I found parts of the book uneven. Specifically, the historical aspects were outstanding and obviously thoroughly researched. In contrast, the sections devoted to genetics and epidemiology came across as superficial. This book is essentially a long editorial, and as such, should be read with a large grain of salt. Nonetheless, it offers a unique perspective."
4,very comprehensive look at adult learning theory,"This book is like a one-stop shopping guide to Adult education. It is so comprehensive that I doubt it leaves out one development in the history of adult education. My only warning is that the opening chapters which basically trace many theories of learning (both adult and traditional) are hard to get through -- it reads more like a research paper that summarizes every major educational theory since the beginning of time. But, if you don't want to know that much, you can simply skip these chapters and get right to the meat of the adult learning theories which are more appropos. For those who need a quick primer on learning theories, you'll love the first few chapters for their abundance of quick summary information. A useful guide to adult education."
2,"A classic, but it does not use its own advice.","Malcolm S. Knowles is the founder of the theory of Andragogy (Adult Education), and I agree with him on many of the points he makes.The problem is that the book seems to have been written for academics to accept Malcolm's theories, and not written for students who wanted to learn to be better teachers in Adult Education.Unless you have to use this book for a textbook for a class, I would not buy it as your first introduction to Adult Education. I'm not sure which book I would buy, but someone must have written a better one to actually learn the subject!"
3,"Andragogy, ok, but where are the updated research and current references?","So, I'm writing a paper on Adult Learning. Basic definitions abound in this book. Excellent beginning book, but not very exciting. I bought it to use as a main reference book. Unfortunately, all the references are older than 10 years ago, and where's the research?? I want to love Andragogy, but the two current authors are not doing anything to perpetuate it. The latest theory definitions are not included in relation to Andragogy either. How about transformational theory, critical pedagogy, adult learning theory, and any others that are around? I contacted one of the authors by phone, but he never responded to my voicemail."
3,Comprehensive,This book could have been shortened to half it's length. In some places it is necessarily comprehensive. In others it is excessively wordy.
4,The Adult learner,"A recommended reference to those who are taking andragogy, adult education, life long education, training and development or alike in HRD or HRM programmes at undergraduate and graduate level."
4,God's Blessing for My Children,I am praying these blessings for my children and grandchildren. I purchased the book used and it was in such good condition when I got it.
2,Knobs too big for some mugs,"Be sure you are planning to use this mug tree with large-handled mugs. Small mugs, like those that come with dinnerware sets, may not fit over the knobs on the ends of the arms. Also, two of the arms did not screw in properly."
4,Oak Mug Tree,It's a nice mug tree. My only complaint is that the pegs are not perpendicular. I also didn't think about how beg the knobs on the ends of the pegs are. They are actually too big to go through the handles of the mugs I bought the mug tree for.
2,OAK MUG TREE,"I BOUGHT 3 OF THIS ITEM TO GET THE FREE SHIPPING. THE ITEM IS NOT VERY WELL MADE BUT THE COST TO SEND IT BACK WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE IF I GOT FREE SHIPPING TO BEGIN WITH. I WOULD NOT TELL ANY OF MY FRIENDS OR FAMILY TO BUY IT, BUT TO LOOK FOR A BETTER QUALITY, MORE SOLID WOOD MUG TREE. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED A MUG TREE TO PUT MY MUGS ON AND MAKE MORE CUPBOARD ROOM."
1,were is my buckle..!!! *____*,I pay for my buckle and I didn't get it were is it.?? I want it I pay for it...
5,A great new vampire novel...,"In this shocking new horror novel vampires haunt the night in modern day North Carolina.Book DescriptionOnce upon a time there was a woman with no conscience. This is her story.You're invited to take a trip down a dark path at night with First Love Croglin, a wicked criminal turned vampire, in this shocking new horror novel. You'll be on the edge of your seat as First Love and her evil Undead companions haunt modern-day North Carolina."
3,Good for those looking for hints on how to play a cleric,"The focus of this book is role playing tips/themes for those playing clerics. Not particularly what I was looking for. I thought it would be more spells, feats, and such."
2,the video moved kind of slow,the video moves slowly and in my opinion does not do a good job of preparing someone to trim their own horse. The footage of the hoof was pretty good and is good for getting better acquainted with the hoof structure. It didn't look to me like he finished the hoof very well after trimming.
4,Brutal,"This album is awesome. It could have been produced better, but they're on Tribunal records not Century Media so give 'em a break. Some parts are remeniscent of Converge, but just when things start getting too crazy, they break in to a pit-inducing breakdown worthy of Hatebreed status. Every one of these musicians is incredible at what they do. The guitars are fast and melodic and at some points downright evil. The drummer is right up there with the guy from Caliban and NOFX's Eric Ghint. Since they're on Tribunal, you don't hear much of the bass but to keep up i'm sure the guy's a monster. The only real problem is the production value on the guy's voice. You can't really hear him all that well, because it is mixed at the same level as the rest of the instruments. At other points his voice sounds a little too much like Rick Ta Life. The guy can growl like a champion though. So if you like chatotic metal with a lot of melody and breakdowns mixed in, then pick up this record."
2,For fanatics only,"Why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent? Besides the money, I mean. There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty. But in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master. Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published."
2,Where was the editor?,"This book was edited by Hienlein's wife, Virginia. If you have read Tramp Royale, you will already have seen that Virginia seemed to be a vain and foolish woman, dull witted at best. This book certainly affirms the dull witted concept. It is overly catagorized, with many sub-catagories containing only one fragment of a letter. As a result, a striaght through reading jerks you all over the calender and back again in the space of a few pages. Very annoying. This would have been a far better book if the fragments had been presented in the order they were written."
2,a disservice to his legacy,"Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy."
3,Your toxic life,"We are surrounded by an unlimited amount of toxins and poisons that are affecting our lives each day. Learn some surprising facts about these toxins that you likely never have considered. Where they are, how they affect you, and how you can avoid them. Getting sick is not an inevitable part of life. You have the option to remove potential causes of illness from your life and this book is a great start."
1,This product is a sham,"This product sounds like someone created this on a computer using a bagpipes setting. This CD should not be ordered by anyone expecting to hear music coming from bagpipes. This is worth about 10 cents as opposed to 10 dollars. It is my strong recommendation that you do not purchase this product. When I purchased the product, there was no sample music to listen to."
3,Sounds like Midi Music,"I was slightly disappointed in this product as I was expecting real bagpipes but what it sounds like is the ""bagpipe"" setting on a keyboard to make Midis. Now I LIKE Midis, but this was not what I thought I would get for this price."
3,"Mostly the Rossetti Siblings, That's It","I was expecting either poetry that inspired the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, such as Tennyson and the English Romantic poets. If it was actual poetry written by the Pre-Raphaelite artists, I was hoping for the poems of Elizabeth Siddal.Instead, there are only five poets' work represented: Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Christina Rossetti, Algernon Charles Swinburne, William Morris, and George Meredith.Breakdown of pages:Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Pages 1-62Christina Rossetti: Pages 63-104Algernon Charles Swinburne: Pages 105-154William Morris: Pages 155-179George Meredith: 180-186There are 194 pages to the book, including the index. I was disappointed with the selections of poetry represented, as well. How can they anthologize Christina Rossetti and not include 'Goblin Market'?If you're looking for a cheap edition of the poetry of Rossettis, this will service. Otherwise, of little interest."
2,Much ado about....,"Maybe it's just me, but as a practical reference I have not found this book to be worth much. Every time I go to it for information on something non-graphics related I find either nothing at all or very skimpy treatment -which is saying something in a book this size. I guess I should have know when I saw the way the XML documenting feature of C# was covered -which was a statement that it was great, but he was not going to cover it. Beyond that he seems to assume some prior knowledge of C++ or C. Hope this works for you if you buy it, it has not done much for me."
1,WOW!,"I'm not sure why I've seen so many good reviews for this book.......I see it as 1200+ pages of wasted paper. Microsoft recommends this book as study material for their exam? Rest assured..... this book doesn't cover anything but drawing pretty little circles, lines, text, and who could forget the cute little spiral, lol! This book contains a lot of useless information regarding the many, let me emphasize that MANYMANYMANY ways of drawing shapes.Unless you plan on writing applications that produce arrays of wonderful shapes on your screen, this book is not for you! Take the time to head down to your local book store and review the content before wasting your money."
2,Verbose,"This book is OK, but could do with some more editing. Amazingly, for all it's verbage, I found the examples to be somewhat limited. A couple of them are not really ""best practices"" to boot."
2,Frustrating! There are better choices.,"This book seemed to be exactly what I wanted: 1200 pages of concentrated information about Windows Forms in C#. Unfortunately, it disappointed me by covering basics for pages and pages (like drawing circles) without getting to anything a developer can actually include in a professional application. Key topics weren't covered: data binding, MDI interfaces, real custom controls, etc. etc. etc. Afterwards, I stumbled across a much better book (although a little short): User Interfaces in C# (Macdonald), which has great ideas for implementing all these sorts of things. There are also some books dedicated just to GDI+ (I think Wrox has one) which would be better if you are looking for just that material."
1,Disappointing,"Typically, I find Microsoft Press books on programming to be very good. This book is very disappointing. It's like someone simply took an internal microsoft specification and reformated. The MSDN is a better reference, and is searchable. This is the only Microsoft Press book I've ever purchased where I'm sorry I spent the money."
2,Lacking depth,"I have to agree with the other reviews who critisize this book.I for one found it lacked depth and didn't cover a lot ofmaterial that I wanted to know about. There's no mentionfor example of how to use the toolbar, and there are sometrick one needs to know to get the toolbar to work effectively.There is no mention of windows with child windows, eg the toplevel property.There isn't much, if any, discussion onon to organise a windows program using C#, especially whendealing with multiple windows.Overall, good for a beginner but as I said it lacks depth for theprofessional. If you any significant amount of programmingyou will soon outgrow this book."
2,Avoids important topics,"I was expecting a lot from this book, but unfortunately it let me down. It feels like a port to C# of his classic Programming Windows. While it is a great reference for drawing graphics, it doesn't even touch some very important aspects of C# and .NET like data binding, MDI forms, or even data grids (the most complex and important control in the forms package) I get the feeling he talks about what he is comfortable and doesn't even mention other big topics. Normally a good strategy for an author, but not for a book that is meant to be a defining reference book."
4,Great book on Windows Forms,"This book provides a good, short introduction to C#. It was my first book on C#, and I did not feel like I needed another after reading it.After those couple of chapters, it provides rather wordy coverage of Windows Forms and drawing graphics with .Net. The title should reflect this more clearly, in my opinion. The book does not talk about programming Windows in general (assemblies, threading, XML, etc.); it focuses solely on the graphical aspects, with some brief look at file I/O.The coverage of Windows Forms and drawing is great, if a somewhat verbose."
1,antique - only for collectors,"My bad - I bought a book that is very early in the evolution of C#, and there are much better books out there now in terms of completeness and being current."
2,In dire need of a revision - no WPF coverage,"Published in 2002, this book is in dire need of an update - as the application GUI used throughout is based on Windows Forms, and there is no coverage of the newer/better WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) GUI implementation, which didn't exist in 2002, but which now has since all but replaced the old Windows Forms ""GUI implementation standard"" for new application development.Petzold's ""Programming Windows"" books had been the ""Gold Standard"" as far as Windows Programming books are concerned (I've been using his books since the early 90's, to program in C for Windows 3.1, Windows 95, etc.); but this situation is now clearly bygone.I now recommend the Deitel & Deital ""How To Program"" series of books, as they have become the new ""Gold Standard"" for Windows Programming texts."
5,AWESOME,"I had looked everywhere for this CD, but couldn't find it anywhere but on Amazon.com.I love this CD, and it is really weird to listen to it and see how much Rascal Flatts has grown since the beginning of their career."
3,good harmonies,"I'm puzzled as to why one ""reviewer"" criticized Rascal Flatts for being ""white"" since country music, with a few exceptions, has been traditionally ""white"" music, just as Blues has traditionally been ""black"" music. Is there something wrong with that? I think Rascal Flatts' harmony and sound is among the best around in country music today. Just because someone doesn't sound like Haggard and Jones doesn't mean they lack talent. You can find a whole lot more singers around, Toby Keith & Shania Twain to name two, who are much less country-sounding than Rascal Flatts. And to say that one would listen to Rascal Flatts because they ""lack the soul to listen to Ricky Martin"" is laughable (what does Ricky Martin have to do with country music?)."
2,Teenie - Bopper Country! Yikes......,"Hank Williams must be rolling in his grave. While these boys do have great vocal ability, they forget the fact that country music is built on bad vocal ability. Their harmonies and melody lines are outstanding, but aside from a fiddle from time to time, there is no trace of country in the songs. If you're looking for country boy bands, you've come to the right place."
4,Their first?,It is very good. I can't really tell that it is an early CD by them. Sounds great. Enjoying it.
5,Rascal Flatts,"I ordered this CD --- I think it was used in ""like new"" conditionl. It was a Christmas gift. Good price even with the'shipping cost. I listened to it to make certain it was O.K. and it was fine."
5,Awesome Early RF,"A must for every fan...yes you'll hear all their hits, but the other cuts on the CD are great too!"
5,I LOVE THESE GUYS!,"RASCAL FLATTS ARE ONE OF THE NEWEST YOUNG HOT GROUPS TO JOIN INTO THE COUNTRY WORLD, AND THEY ARE AWSOME! I ENJOY LISTENING TO THIER MUSIC EVERYDAY. THIER HARMONIES ARE TERRIFIC AND TOGETHER, THEY JUST SOUND WONDERUL! I AM SO HAPPY I HAVE THIER CD, I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT. AND JOE DON ROONEY IS JUST TOO CUTE FOR WORDS. THIS ALBUM IS ONE I JUST PLAY RIGHT THROUGH, EVERY SONG IS BETTER THAN THE NEXT. THEY ARE AN AWSOME GROUP,AND THEY ARE GOING TO ROCK THE COUNTRY WORLD! LOOK OUT NASHVILLE.... HERE THEY COME."
1,a journey to the underworld via Rascal Flatts!,"Did Dante cover any turf named the Rascal Flatts when he took us on a tour to hell with his Inferno? Well - he should have, because these guys represent one of the strongest signals that hell is real and vibrant within todays musical culture. Yes, venture into hell - listen to Rascal Flatts - there is plenty of hell for all of us, and at such a low low price how can you resist? Nocturnal Bats - Theological Spats? no - silly, this is Rascal Flatts - obviously put here to give Lucifer a run for his money. Enjoy!"
5,Rascal Flatts are the latest in country music.,"I've been ""Waiting All My Life"" for a CD this good. ""Some Say"" that this CD is too pop, that it isn't country att all. I say to them: ""Get real!"" Rascal Flatts is cool, they're ""in"", and they'll make you believe in good music. There are the beutiful ballads--""It's Not Just Me"", ""See Me Through"" (my favorite!) and ""While You Loved Me."" Then you get the good foot-tapping songs--""Praying For Daylight"", ""Some Say"", ""Waiting All My Life"", and ""This Everyday Love."" At to that the other songs and ""I'm Movin' On""--the sadest song ever--and you've got a great album. Buy it today!"
5,Can't get enough of Rascal Flatts!,"Okay, I bought this cd after I saw the video for ""This Everyday Love,"" which I recorded and watched about 20 times a night! The cd is awesome, and the sound of Gary's voice is just so incredibly unique!! Whether its a ballad or upbeat, these guys have proven that they will be around for a LONG time!"
5,A Must for Country music lovers,"I recently bought the Rascal Flatts cd and i must say, its a great edition to my collection!! i love this cd and there is not a song on it that i don't love. I definately recommend it to anyone looking for something new to listen to. The vocals of this group are wonderfully harmonized and they are surely going to be around for a very long time."
5,I love Rascal Flatts,"This CD is one of the best I have ever heard, I don't skip over any of the songs, it plays over and over. In fact I own two copies, one stays in the car, the other in the house. That way I always have it handy to listen to it. I had the pleasure of meeting the guys and they are the best you would ever hope to meet. Very nice and down to earth, and cute!"
3,Backstreet Boys on a Country Trip,"""Hey! Your Backstreet Boys is in my Country!"" ""Your Country is in my Backstreet Boys!"" Hmmmmm! For you closeted Backstreet Boys fans who like country, THIS CD IS FOR YOU! For you country fans, you MAY like it, a few songs here and there like me. For you Backstreet Boys fans, you will think you are getting down to your ROOTS if you get this CD. All in all, an OK CD - Bubblegum Country if you will."
5,OH MY GOD!!!,I am NOT a country music fan but in my opinion Rascall Flatts is THE BEST group EVER! I could listen to them sing ALL DAY EVERY DAY!!!
5,Excellent CD!,"I first discovered Rascal Flatts on CMT, and I absolutely fell in love! I am now totally, and completely addicted to their music! It is a definate must-have for Country Music fans, and even Music fans in general. You don't have to like Country Music to appreciate these three guys. Gary, Jay, and Joe Don, are absolutely wonderful!"
2,Some authors should not read their own work.,"There are very few authors who can both write and give a good performance on the audio of their books. Ms. Parks is not one of them. She may be a gifted playwrite and novelist, but she's not a narrator. You'd think someone who works in theater would understand the concept of voice talent, and make her publisher hire some to read her book for the audio version. Alas, Ms. Parks undertook the job herself, and the effect leaves a lot to be desired. For example, if you're going to have your characters speak in a regional patois, you can't then read it as though it's beneath you to speak that way, hesitating just slightly before each mispronunciation or grammatical error as though to disassociate yourself and make it clear that you don't speak that way. I've heard electronically read books with more feeling. Stick with the printed page for this one."
2,A good story,"This novel tells a very good story ""IF"", you can get past the extremely bad english. I passed this book on to a couple of co-workers and not 1 was willing to finish the book. I struggled with this book all the way to the end. It told a very good story but (I feel) it should have been written with better english. I understand where the author was going with the english but, oooooh weeeeee."
3,Okay but not great,"Getting Mother's Body doesn't live up to the rave reviews here. It is an okay book, don't get me wrong but it's too tied up in language and details to be an enjoyable read. Parks definitely has a gift, but the flowery language fell deaf on my ears. I much more enjoyed the previous readings of Sovereign Rule and The Da Vinci Code."
4,Great characterizations,"The plot of this book is without a doubt an engaging page-turner. The events unfold through the alternating voices of a variety of characters. And while this is not a terribly long book and there's a number of characters in on the action, Parks does a wonderful job of creating nuanced, very human characterizations. The misery and joy of being a minority living in small-town Texas in 1963 is beautifully captured with great humor and tenderness."
4,A good read,"This book is, at turns, funny and sad. It was hard to get into at first, but at the end I wished it wasn't over. I usually find that if I don't identify strongly with a character OR at least like or care strongly about a character, I get bored pretty quickly with a book. This is an exception to that rule - I didn't particularly *like* any of the characters, yet I cared what happened to every one of them. This is a story about family (and really, the line between functional and dysfunctional is hard to draw sometimes), history, greed, and love. The characters are all flawed human beings trying to live their lives and maintain family ties that are realistically complicated by class, gender, sexual orientation, and being black in the south. Not a masterpiece, but a strong novel and a good read nonetheless."
5,Best Book I've read in Years,"One of those books you can not put down. I don't want to repeat what others have said. What I can tell you is that after being in a book group for over a year, this was the first book I actually finished early. I went to the Library to see if she had writen any others but she hadn't. She is a Playwright andamazon sells them. We have Book club book bags at our library and this was one of them.When I read this book I could realy see the characters clearly, her descriptions were poetry. I felt I could feel there tears almost smell them.Keep writing Suzan-Lori your wonderful. Teach me to write like that. When will you have another play? Anyone seen any of them?Just Wonderful!!"
4,EXCELLENT FICTION DEBUT,"Ms. Park's work is notorious here in NYC so I rushed out to purchase her first novel and I WAS NOT disappointed! Engaging from the start, Ms. Parks created characters that peak your interest, I wanted to sit down with Dill and LOOK at this person! All the characters are deep and well developed for a story that I found to be WAAAAAY too short. The tale comes full circle, with enough drama in between.Unforgettable characters, deep, emotionally charged plot.... this one hits high marks on the recommendation scale!"
4,"Good condition, but little yellowed.","The Book, Biblical Themese for Pastoral Care was in good condition and usuable. I just expected it to not look as old and used, but it is usuable. Thanks."
1,Yeah I'm going to agree with some other reviewers and say...,"Nelly you are a disgrace, I keep hearing comments like ""Oh this album is original"" or ""His flow is smooth"", why? because his voice is unique? So what? His lyrics are crap pure and simple no meaning behind them except for the usual mainstream ""bling bling"" and ... attitude. This proves that if you have a unique voice and some good beats you can get all the little supposed hip hop fans to follow you and buy you're album (Cash Money, Master P and about 80% of the rappers in public eye today).... because this is nothing but garbage and fillers."
3,A good cd with some weak tracks,"This cd has some killer tracks on there, then theres some songs where youll be sittin there sayin ""what the is up with this guy?!""Country grammer (wow,big surprise) isnt the best song on the cd.Number 13, and number 10 featuring lil wayne are my favorites.So the cds pretty hot,so why does it only get 3 stars?Nelly really doesnt rap about anything that cash maney(no they aint exactly my rappers of choice)hasnt put out 5 cds about.Nelly says being from st. Louis he gets influence from everywhere, then how come all i hear him rapping about are his chrome 20s, jewelery, etc.If this cd where only 6 songs, and the best ones, it'd be better, oddly enough.But i am glad nelly broke out, he does deserve it, he can rap in different tones,which is one of the reasons hes so cool.But he needs to be more versatile the next time around.This cd has some kickin stuff on it.But some of its just plain weak."
5,NELLY'S CD IS OFF DA HEEZY! A MUST-BUY,"Nelly has definately put the midwest on the map. He has great songs on his cd along with his smashing hit, Country Grammar. These songs are calm and relaxing. It makes you wanna lay back and just bob your head to the beats. Nelly came out with a style like no one else's. He has created his own and has opened the doors to the rest of the many local rappers we have here in not only St. Louis, but the Midwest. His cd is a must-buy!"
4,Not Your Average Artist,"Aight, this guy, Nelly, he isn't like every other rapper, his lyrics are full of murder, rape, guns or gang related crimes. He is more concerned about havin a good time with his boyz and ladies, and doesn't bother singing about how if you look at you wrong he's gonna kill you and your family. I mean the violent lyrics don't bother me it's just a nice change."
3,Country Grammar,"This was a No Limit Record. In other words the only good song was Country Grammar. The rest of the cd was just... well lets not go in to that. All I can say is that Nelly is still young. With time he will turn into an expierecied rapper. Who knows maybe he could even join hotboys. Again this is Nellys first record. Give him a chance to improve his lyrics, and then consider buying his next cd."
2,*If U reppin tha SOUTH...come wit sumpin a lil BETTA!*,"Ya'll kno dat nicca Don'ell had get dis CD too! I give it 2.5 stars! Nelly CAN rap...but he coulda don wayyyyy betta! I like 3 songs! #8(E.I), #9(Thicky thick Girl) and #10(For my) I like dat 1 cuz it gotz Lil Wayne on it! How tha hell tha guest gon OUT SHINE tha artist?¿? (lmao) N E way..like i said...Nelly can rap...but he missin sumpin! Alot of dem beats sound some-what alike 2! Hopefully ya'll can find sumbody else Nelly CD and dubb it! lol Dis aint worth ya money! And das R~E~A~L! Hopefully he'll make an impressive COME-BACC album! Much Luv...{#28712}"
1,IGNORANCE,"I liked the song Country Grammar the first time I heard it. I even liked it the tenth time I heard it. Once it got to being around 10000 ... I was sick of Nelly and sick of his song. Then the radio got ahold of another Nelly song ... EI. If that isnt the worst song Ive heard in my life, I dont know what it is. The only thing that changed in that song from Country Grammar is the horrible drum beat and the ignorant lyrics. If you are contemplating buying this album you should contemplate suicide."
1,as bad as the hot boys?,"Is Nelly as bad as the Hot Boys? NO he's worse. Have you ever tried to listen to the lyrics in any of his songs? If you like him, obviously not because he doesn't talk about anything. Alright i'm going to try to keep an open mind here, but let me tell you a little story. Last summer i was at home flipping through channels when i came across the video to ""back that thang up"" i was awstruck. It was the single most disgraceful thing to hip hop i'd ever seen. Earlier this summer that all changed however when i came upon the Nelly video. He is the wackest rap performer ( i'm not even going to call him a mc or rapper) to ever pick up a microphone. If you are a Hot Boys fan you might like him however. I respect peoples tastes and opinions but wow is this guy horrible."
1,utter pap,why does nelly try to act hard when he's the most pop r n b singer going? beats me.0 stars
1,Nelly Betta Watch Out...,"Man look, I will admit that Nelly has some pretty tight beats but his lyrics are like something off of the Disney channel or something I mean,whats up with the band-aids and stuff and the big a@# Nelly chain. Point being, this cd is for little girls between 12-16 and little boys 12-16. Its weak, im tellin you and he sings with his lyrics too, c'mon now. He's getting on the level of MC Hammer now and will soon fall. Once you get to the mainstream like that, people get tired of hearing the same old ish but people got tired of him after his first album. KRS 1 will further break this thing down for ya'll, just keep ya ears open...1"
1,JUST SORRY,ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE 1 HIT GET RICH CATS I ANT STANDING. IF YOU BOUGHT THIS CD AND THOUGHT IT WAS TIGHT GIMME A 20 SAC OF DAT SH** YOU WAS SMOKING.
2,Played out,"Being from St. Louis, I was quick to pick up this CD. I did like him at first...""Country Grammer"" is a catchy song that grows on you. Overall, the album has a few catchy songs, some mediocre beats, and cliche lyrics. If you happen to enjoy hip hop that has no real meaning, no depth, & you just want something to bob your head to, then pick this CD up. Personally, I'm tired of hearing it on every radio station.Before Nelly blew up, before the St. Lunitics got a taste of fame, they did actually have some potential. I remember hearing the St. Lunitics on the radio just a couple years ago. I doubt anyone outside of St. Louis even knew who the hell they were. I liked them then & I expected a lot more...Oh well."
3,Eh... It's okay...,"I don't buy hip-hop albums very often. Just as I suspected though, this music isn't very timeless. I like some of the tracks, but I cannot help but think of how dated this album can sound."
2,"Pop rap, LOL","Well if you apreciate hip hop for deep and poetic lyrics that rep somebodys pain and struggles and life experiences, then this isn't for you. It is more of pop rap disguised as southern flava rap. And it works sometimes like on ""EI"" ( a catchy song, you'll never stop singing it) and a few others. I also liked ""Rid Wit Me"" and basically all the singles. But for the most part Nelly just doesn't have anything worth listening to. He's not real down to earth or flashy on the other hand, and his beats are kinda tired."
3,"It's aight, what was all the hype about?","Country Grammar gets entertaining at first, but all that sing-songy stuff gets tiring. Plus, he's six times platinum, but I don't know anyone who has this album!!! Nor do I know any cat bumping this album or who will admit to owning this album. Get it off the internet, but don't spend your money on it."
1,One of the milestones in the downfall of modern music,"This is what I consider one of the cornerstones of when hip-hop went bad. There are literally one or two DECENT tracks on this album and the rest are strictly cheerleader ""rhymes"" with little ""flows"" mixed in between... Almost all songs sound the same, except for ""Ride Wit Me"" which is one of teh standout songs on the album, but was completely sold out on the radio. Additionally, on Ride Wit Me, everyone else who flows on the song sounds better than the ""front man,"" Nelly, and makes you wonder why he was the St. Lunatic with the album out first.It's too bad that MTV has ruined Music so much by making it more of a fashion show than about GOOD music. If you're looking for something with a hot fresh sound, pass on this ish... If you need a random CD for Skeet-shooting target practice, pick up about 10 copies... You won't miss..."
3,Commercial But HIT,"YEh, this is CD is commercial and i am not a big Nelly fan at all but this CD does have some decent songs. Of course, not every song is good but St. Louie, Country Grammar, E.I. are all decent tracks production wise and lyric wise. Also, the St. Lunatic show up a little bit and they are not so bad either, its just some songs are extremely commercial and it gets on ppl nerves after a few listens, ex. Ride WIt Me...Otherwise this CD is fine..."
3,this....,... alb aint bad. he presents himself with a uniqe style which is a mix of james brown n dmx. n comin with a uniqe style in this biz is hard if you wanna keep it true to yourself which he doea. good tracks on it like For My with lil wayne n St. Louie but some just dont cut it......
3,7-10,THIS ALBUM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.NELLY IS STRAIGHT THOUGH DON'T GET ME WRONG.NELLY DOES A GOOD JOB TO GET HIS CITY ON THE MAP.PEACE TO THE METROS IN ST.LOUIS.
5,Bill Gates Donald Trump let me hear ya now,"Country Grammer let me hear you now. The album is hot. Grammer's style is new and just what I want to hear cause I am tired of all that same old rap coming out. Grammer keeps it real and brings a totally new flavor, so original and im just sayen to check this title out. Its a nice little TREAT."
1,Hot Garbage,"I have tried to be quiet about nelly, but I can't. This cd is pure garbage. I gave it one star because I had to. It really deserves 0. If Biggie and Pac were still alive puttin out REAL Hot Sh*t, then this illiterate buster nelly and the st. foolatics would have been too embarassed to even call themselves rappers. I hope nelly reads this himself, (or asks someone to read it to him) and he thinks about everything I said before he comes out with another cd that makes my ears hurt. So what if millions of people buy your crap, beacuse of a song that has garbage lyrics and a catchy tune (they did the same for M.C. Hammer) You can call me a hater if you want, but nelly sucks."
2,"Before Nelly started ""Karaoke""!","This c.d was great!I didnt no Nelly had such talent....back in the day.Now this guy is a worthless toothpick that no one like's anymore.How in God's name are you gonna make two c.d's,then recreate them into one and think you're gonna make more money especially when the first two c.d's sucked anyway?You tell me.Nelly no one cares about you,your fake platinum teeth(grill for you idiots who dont know)or anything else for that matter.However i do think Nelly is an good actor becuase in the Longest Yard remake he did act pretty good for someone with no music talent.How about a career change Nelly.Go from the rap to acting.Maybe you good do something good for once.How about try calling Hollywood perhaps."
5,country grammer rulez,if u don't have the cd u hve to get it. the song country grammer is one of my favorite rap songs. its just a really sweet song.
1,"Well, someone has to tell him..","Nelly, you are UGLY! The beautiful girls in your videos would not look twice at you if it weren't for the bling bling. Now that that's out of the way, we can get on to your music. It, too, is HORRIBLE. If you asked me to ride wit ya' I'd laugh in your face. When people realize that rap is just talking over an annoying back beat, maybe they'll be able to see through you."
1,READ THIS! BAD CD!,"dont buy this cd, besides one song it is terrible. If you want a good cd go buy Master P GHETTO POSTAGE!"
1,.......Please!,"This album, ""Country Grammar,"" is straight up trash! When I listened to this album for the first time, I thought it couldn't get any worse....then, in 2002, he came with an even worse album (which I've already reviewed). Weak beats with an even weaker rhyme style...but, what do you expect from a ""rapper"" who's fan base consists of middle school girls. Take it from KRS-1, Nelly isn't a worthy addition to Hip Hop culture. He's a disgrace to it. His career will come to an end soon and he'll be remembered as a ""has been"" just like MC Hammer or Vanilla Ice."
1,PURE GARBAGE,"Well, since I'm from St.Louis, I guess I'm supposed to consider this guy a hometown hero.Wrong.This album is yet another perfect example of what has gone wrong with hip-hop.The lyrics are the same garbage we have been hearing over and over and over and over from rap artists for years, except with the twist that Nelly has the rhyming talent of a 5 year old.The beats almost all sound the same...which means after several listens they become catchy to high school girls, which means radio stations and MTV will play them even more, which means the artist will blow up to unbelievable proportions.<BR..."
1,COMMERCIAL GARBAGE,"It's sad when this guy is said to be the best rapper right now,c'mon remember when we had Pac,Big,and Snoop when he was good,those were the days,now we have this clown,lucky us. This isn't even rap,just the hip hop version of bacstreet boys,this imposter better leave.Peace"
4,good i like it betta than the bad NELLYVILLE,THIS CD IS GOOD...but nellyville wuzent.this is a good cd and i like the songs.my favorite song is 'country grammer'.that song rocks.all the songs are not good though.but most of the songs are.this is a good cd ta chill to wit some homies in da 'hood.no really it is.to see the good side of nelly GET THIS CD NOW.thats my word.
1,Nelly is wack,"First of all I like 2 say who ever compare NELLY to Lauryn hill is a fool. Nelly is 1 hit wonder, I don't care how much albums he sold cause M.C. hammer with 15x platinum. What makes a great m.c. 2 me is lyrics not beats or chorus. Nelly's album has beats & catchy chorus but no LYRICS. Not once he spit anything that makes me want 2 get up and rewind that. I don't like when all a m.c. rap about is ""girls, cars, & money"" but if u going 2 do this at least display lyrics like Jay-z. Nelly is a 1 hit wonder cause like always hip hop fans will move on 2 the next ""hit"" club song. Real rapper like Eminem, Rakim, canibus, Wu Tang, Big Daddy, 2Pac, Krs-one, mos def, Xzibit, Jay-Z and etc. real have their place in the hip hop hall of fame. While like M.C. Hammer, Ma$e, Ca$h money, silk the shocker, and nelly will have their place in the hip hop hall of shame."
1,Martin Luther King would be proud,"Imagine how proud the black civil rights leaders of the 1960's would be to hear this CD! Lyrically, Nelly offers a hopeful, encouraging vision for his fans: crime, sex and drugs for their own sake, and without consequences. Musically, it is quite catchy, with overamped bass that both moves your body and lowers your SAT scores."
1,Plain and Simply put . . . .,"This album clearly displays the one thing many people have known for sometime. Nelly is not, nor will he ever be, hip-hop. Nelly is a true disservice to those great artists that established what hip-hop is all about. Do yourselves a favor and go listen to The Roots, Wu-Tang Clan, KRS-One, and there are so many others, I don't have time to name. Just anything but this guy."
3,Alright,"Nelly's highly anticipated debut album (thanks to his successful single ""Country Grammar (Hot Sh**)"") is o.k. Not good or bad, just o.k. The production is somewhat similar to Cash Money Records and obviously very different from traditional NYC Hip-Hop. His rapping style is a sing-sang style rather than ""straight spittin'."" If you liked the single, you'll probably like the album as well because you can expect more of the same. The weakness is probably that most of the songs sound alike, and the strength (or weakness, depending on your perspective) is the radio-friendly beats/production. Ths best song, in my opinion, is ""Luven' Me."" As the final verdict, if you liked the single, pick it up, if you didn't, don't."
5,Nelly,"1. Intro - No rating for intro**2. St. Louie (8/10)3. Greed, Hate, Envy (9/10)4. Country Grammar (Hot...) (10/10)5. Steal the Show (8/10)6. Interlude (7/10)7. Ride Wit Me (10/10)8. E.I. (10/10)9. Thicky Thick Girl (8/10)10. For My (9/10)11. Utha Side (8/10)12. Tho Dem Wrappas (10/10)13. Wrap Sumden (9/10)14. Batter Up (8/10)15. Never Let 'Em C U Sweat (10/10)16. Luven Me (9/10)17. Outro -**"
2,Grammar not getting across clearly,"I'm a big fan of Nelly and I like everything he does, but if you can't decide if you want ""Country Grammar"" or ""Nellville"" go with Nellyville. Other than ""Greed, Hate, Envy"", ""E.I."", ""Ride with me"", and ""Country Grammar"" there's nothing good on this album. All of the other tracks are just ordinary tracks from a debut rapper trying to go gold. I don't see how it went 7x platinum. It's a CD I regret buying."
4,go nelly !!!!!,i think that this debut album is fantastic. nelly has a sound and voice all his own..plus he aint bad looking either.from midwest swing to groovin tonight to here we come they are all great cant wait for his second solo album
5,This is a must buy.,Most of this cd is a mixture of R/B and rap. Almost every song on this cd is good. The only bad songs are ST.Louie and the skits. The best song is either Country Grammar or Ohter Side. If you liten to the samples you'll se what im talking about. Go get this.
5,Awesome!,"This CD is the best! Every song is great. Just about anyone would love this CD! The very best songs are Country Grammer, E,I, Batter Up, and Never let'em c u sweat."
2,Not the best,"ok but nellys rapping skills could be MUCH better. Lyrics are alright but most of the songs are basically the same with a different beat. Drugs, girls and not much else, eminem is a better influence than this guy, great beats though."
1,no way,"My sister has this CD and I've heard it enough to say that this is the most horrible attempt at rap I have ever heard! Try Eminem's newest CD, it's a much better investment than this."
4,suprisingly good,"I dont have much to say about this album,,, however this is better than you would expect. ""Country Grammer"" is obviously a very good song, but the rest of this album is also good. Lil wayne from the Hot Boys is on the song called ""for my.."". ""thicky thick girl"" is also good. You would expect this album to only have that 1 song but it has many other good songs on it also"
5,Great Party Album,"the beats are party beats and theyre off the hook. though Nelly won't challenge Nas or 2pac int he lyrics region his music is still bumpin for the club or party. buy this if u like to party. though Nelly's sing-song flow is not the best ive herd, its still good.BEST SONGS: ""St. Louie"", ""Greed Hate Envy"". ""Country Grammer"", ""Ride Wit Me"", ""EI"", ""Thicky Thick Girl"", ""For My"", ""Wrap Sumden"", ""Batter Up"""
1,"This Is Not ""R & B""!!!","WHY DO YOU PEOPLE KEEP CALLING RAP, ""R & B""? What Wilson Pickett, Aretha, James Brown, Otis Redding, Gladys Knight sang is ""R & B"". Not this stuff. It's rap and hip/hop. Call it what it is, please!"
4,Primo party music.,"Though hip-hop nation's twin capitals have long been L.A. and New York City, there's plenty of strong regional competition. Witness the recent success of groups like New Orleans's Cash Money Millionaires and Miami's Trick Daddy. And with his first solo album, Country Grammar, which has soared to the top of Billboard's charts, Nelly has now marked his hometown of St. Louis as a major contender.Powered by the bass-heavy, syncopated give-and-take that is the hallmark of much Southern hip-hop, Nelly adds a certain laid-back charm that is all his own, especially on the title track (which has the same hook as Little Anthony and the Imperials' ""Shimmy Shimmy Ko-Ko Bop"" from 1959). Also catchy is ""Ride Wit Me,"" which bounces along with attitude aplenty. Nelly has a limited thematic vocabulary, but if escapism is on the agenda, this St. Louis slugger may be just the ticket."
5,The greatest,"I love this album...its one of the best i have heard in a while. ""Ride wit me"" is the best song...its so relaxin and i just cruise to it all day."
2,THE REVIEW 2 1/2 stars,"Nelly has some tight beats to some of his songs, but he cant rap, the sh$t he says is weak , basically his album was soft. he got about 4 good catchy songs bringing beats, the song with Lil Wayne was tight(For My N's).u just have to see for your self to see what im talkin aobut"
4,Highly enjoyable,"I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I loved ""Hot Sh*t"", but I thought the rest of the album couldn't be as good as that song. Although not all the songs are that good, there are some that are even better. ""Ride Wit Me"", ""EI"", ""St. Louie"" and ""Batter Up"" are all great tunes with major cruisin' power. A slighly uneven listen, but an enjoyable one nonetheless."
1,Who Called It a hip hop classic????????,Good Lyrics??? this is not hip hop its pop. Nelly takes rap n anotherlevel??? to all you pop listeners stop calling it rap its not. Nelly Is a black justin timberlake
3,I'm not sure if he's singing or rapping.......,"Recently it was announced that this CD went 7x platinum (7 million CDs sold) that's great and I'm always glad to see a kat from the slums of hood life make it out. BUT!! he needs a write a big check to MTV, because like N'sync, B.S. Boyz and other POP stars they wouldn't be where they are today without them rotating thier video every hour every day. Like Bone-Thugs-In-Harmony, he sings not rap. Call it R&B, call it POP, call it a street serenade but to call it hip-hop...... yall are killing me."
4,Creative,"I got to hand it to Nelly for his new brand of hip hop for being original. Tight Beats, Catchy hooks, and Nelly's semi-on point lyrics make this above average. Decent debut."
5,Nelly's Off the Hook,"Nelly's CD is off the hook, I really love this CD. Hs is a very Talented young man, who has skills. If you have not bought this CD then you need to go buy it right NOW! Stop wasting time and go and get it.!"
3,Used Book Review,"The book was in good shape. It was mailed in good time. I'm very pleased to have it at such good savings. Thank you, gini"
4,An excellent documentation,"This was an extremely interesting expose of how police K'9's are actually trained in some cases. This inhumane treatment should be thoroughly investigated. Since the author got her information first hand, one could hardly question her information."
4,Can't find this color in the stores,"I use this on new shinny brass fixtures to give them some age. Steel wool the brass, clean and add some instant age. I have installed many old fashioned school lights in my kitchen. I use antique original globes because these are ""opal"" glass, not frosted. But I find it hard to find the original fitters. So I use modern reproduction fitters with this paint to make them look old."
3,Rich Caramel,"The finish of this paint is just OK. It doesn't look all that metallic, but it does resemble caramel. The paint applies very even and dries quickly. That all being said, I'm not a huge fan of this color but it is a decent paint.I give this 3 stars because the finish of the paint does not look like the can lid or what was advertised on Amazon.com, even magnified several times. It was a bit disappointing, not what I was looking for."
5,"Tough, tougher, toughest!","""The Toughest Girl Alive"" reflects Candye's immense talent as a songwriter and a singer. The diverse songs make this CD a real jewel. Not only do they have great lyrics to which it is easy to relate, they also have this swing and rhythm that goes straight into your blood! You just can't keep your feet on the ground, while Candye's powerful voice wants to make you ""Scream in the Night""! Five stars for this well-rounded CD!"
5,99% red hot rockabilly singing!,"Most of Candye Kane's cd's have a varierty of blues, jump blues, swing, jazz, and rockabilly. Her voice is similar to Janis Martin or Ruth Brown of teh 50's. She really has a retro sound, very authebtic, in particular this cd ""Toughest Gal Alive"" has a lot of rockabilly style vocals. At times she sort of squeels in a high pitched voice at the end of a phrase teh way Wanda Jackson did in her classic rockabilyl 50's sides. Candye does a few jump blues, but this is teh cd for a rockabilyl fan to get, of all of Candye's cd's. the toughesy Girl Alive is particular is a rockabilly new classic track. This cd si very appealing and sounds as if it were recorded in teh 1954-56 period of swingin rockin' blues. great music, and I'm 23 years old, and I love it ,and so do all my other pompadour wearing Elvis look alike rockabilly greaser friends, we all love Candye."
5,"Rowdy, Raunchy and Righteous!","I love this CD!It is simply some of the most enjoyable, flat-out goodtime music I've heard in a long time.Sure it gets bawdy at times...but even if you played it so loud as to offend the neighbors, they'd probably start bopping along and get in the swing!Candye Kane is a performer who could easily get by being little more than a novelty act...but she has a mountain of talent and doesn't rely on her wild personality to carry her through. Sure, she lets that personality shine. But how could she not?Listening to this CD, I kept admiring her exuberance.I think it is great that she gives us a bit of trash, a whole lot of honkey-tonk, and never gets too classy on us.This is music for letting loose and having fun.Very wonderful stuff!!"
1,I fail to see the appeal,Candye Kane displays no subtlety whatsoever. Neither is she gutsy or innovative. What's to like?
1,Low-Grade Blues Sung Badly,"If this is blues, Otis Spann was wrong--the blues are already dead. Onstage in Long Beach, California she put on her typical show, playing keyboards with her oversized mammaries. No joke! Think of all the good musicians who die broke, and one is left with the undeniable conclusion that people have no taste or decency whatsoever."
4,This book has everything,"This is a wonderful reference for prospective or current owners of a Golden Retriever, but especially for someone who has a new Golden puppy. I bought this book as soon as we had decided on a Golden when the litter was 4 weeks of age so I could do a lot of reading before the puppy came home. The author is ""right on"" when it comes to the breed. She accurately describes all of its best traits as well as its shortcomings regarding food allergies, skin allergies, etc. She tells you exactly what to look for in a new puppy and what to avoid. There are no surprises about the breed once you have read this book. It covers all aspects regarding feeding, grooming, bonding, training, living with an older dog - everything you will encounter over the years with your dog. If you have any doubts, check this book out at your local library or bookstore . . ."
2,Low Information Content,"This book is very long on lauditory rhetoric for golden retrievers, but the density of practical information is low. What and how much should my dog eat? High quality food and enough but not too much. The breeder gave me a little pamphlet issued by Purina that had the same basic information that I got from this book in about 3 pages."
2,I gather the author likes animals more than kids!!,"I checked this book out at our public library. I felt that the author reiterated points over and over. Some of the items were basic common sense things, but good to review nonetheless. But, as I was reading, I noticed a common theme... she didn't care much for children. Just listen to this paragraph... ""How irritating it is to be out walking your dog, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine, and suddenly find that you are about to be attacked by a young child....."" There's more.. and she tries to soften her response later in the chapter by obviously trying to cover up how she really feels about children. YIKES! That made me put the book down right then and there. Sorry, Betsy.. Dogs and kids go hand in hand. My suggestion to the reader is don't buy her books. There are many other good authors out there."
4,Its good stuff!,Okay. I know that alot of people have frowned upon this album but it is actually high quality stuff. I mean yeah it is a little generic but I think the group adds thier own twist to what they do. It is a good emo/ punk-pop album. Any fans of this genre will most likely like it. Again awesome stuff... just not amazing
1,Same ol' crap.,Listened to a few songs from the new album and it just doesn't fly. Same sounds as the previous album with a bunch of rebellious monotone lyrics that it's hard to connect to. These songs have been done before by all of the other bands in this genre.
1,The end of CONSERVATIVISM,"Whenever a conservative says or writes something, the opposite is actually true. So when this conservative hack says that liberalism is dying, that means that conservativism is dying. With each passing year, each so-called liberal idea (gay marriage, expanding the middle class, progressive tax rates, women's health and reproductive rights, etc.) gets more and more backing. Why? Because conservatives voters are, quite literally, *DYING* off, and their grandchildren are voting for these policies.Unlike conservatives, we liberals don't want to take the country back. We want to take it *FORWARD*."
3,Great summary,"I am not giving Ted Lowi's book three stars. I am giving my three stars to the reviewer who wrote the wonderful summery of Mr. Lowi's ponderous book. For those who don't have the time to actually read this book, I recommend the summary, especially for graduate students in political science who have to spend their time trying to decipher these kinds of books."
1,the end of liberalism by theodore lowi,I have just completed this book and I really need the help pf someone who truly understood this book and who actually had to write a paper on this book. It was not a book I would recommend to anyone if they had to actually write about the book and they way I have to write the report is based on Public Policy. ThanksTammy Ferris
1,Not that great,"I heard about this book from friends and fellow professors (although no one really recommended it). It was supposed to have made waves when it was first published. It is, indeed, a very difficult book to read. A general reader will need a good background on American history and political theory. Also, it is not very well-written. If anyone can write a concise summary of what the author is trying to say, I would appreciate it."
4,Great Idea,"Great Idea, but I can't get them on the toilet fast enough for my toddler to use - she isn't good at anticipating the need to use the bathroom. But, when I do get them on in time, I am so relieved to have her sit on something clean - little kids legs and hands also touch that public restroom and it's so nice to have these. They stick for when she slides down and adjusts her position. I did have a couple accidentally get sucked down into the toilet, but I didn't master the finesse of unsticking them before that automatic flusher kicks in!"
5,Great product!,"I bought two boxes of these before our vacation. Usually I just line with TP for my kids, but I wanted something better, since often the seats on public toilets are wet and these were perfect. Worked exactly like they are supposed to, kept us all clean and dry and germ free on public toilets. Thanks for a great product!"
2,BOX FITS 3x5 cards!,"Please note that this box fits 3x5 recipe cards, NOT 4x6 cards. The description of this item is very unclear and I was under the impression that it would fit my 4x6 recipe cards. If you are looking for a box for 3x5 cards, I'd give this 5 stars; if you are looking for a box that fits 4x6 cards, order something else."
2,Recipe box,"Not the best quality of wood, and it arrived with some scratches in the sides. I wouldn't buy this box again. Spend a little more $ and purchase something better."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this box rather than some others because it appeared to come with dividers. They are very flimsey and I had to throw them out. Also the box is very cheap looking and a little bit dirty. I wanted a box for 3x5 cards, so once I get some new recipe dividers it will serve its purpose...but only until I can find a nice one down the road. I don't recommend this product."
4,Good Stuff,Only place to find certain songs on CD. Very much praise oriented. The Music is on the slow side but still good. Could have used more rockers.
1,"Ignore the price tag, this is a worthless camera","After the first camera I got didn't work at all, that should have been my first indication. Not to mention all the previous comments that agree that this camera is NOT worth any price.It's really cute, sure, but the monitor on back is grainy, and my screen had a huge line down the center. The flash is really bright and over exposes the pictures. The pictures I took with flash on look one dimensional and the grainy. The ones without a flash are barely visible (I was in a bright room.)To zoom, you have to go into a menu to select options. The picture is very rocky when you're looking through the view finder.Great price, but save your money for a better camera. Not good if you care about the quality of your pictures.Don't fall for the looks, pay attention to the comments and DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!"
1,Oregon Scientific Should Be Ashamed,I give it one star for a nice red color.The other reviews are correct on all points!! Even after being charged all night the battery only lasts five minutes or five pictures.To Oregon Scientific Co. : If you can't make something right- don't make anything at all.Sony-here I come!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!,"One of the things no one mentions is you HAVE TO HAVE A USB PORT (i.e. computer) to recharge the battery. There is NO switching to new batteries when the non-replacable internal battery goes dead, which it did after about 15 pictures. I purchased this camera as a Christmas present. It worked for about 36 hours and then ALL it would do was beep 3 times when any button was pushed. Oregon Scientific was non-responsive to numerous emails and calls. They finally responded after 2 weeks but by then I had already returned the camera. It may look cool but it didn't work very well at all."
4,Good Camera,Really impressed with the range for this camera. It had excellent zoom and my pictures came out looking studio quality. Very handy.
2,bad purchase,"I bouth this camera for my sister on her 15th birthday, she was very excited with it at first, cause it was red and light weith, but after trying it, she didn't like it no more, battery dies after 7-10 pictures."
1,Don't buy CMOS cameras,"Most good digital cameras use CCD lens technology. CMOS is old, normally used for security cameras. Even though I don't own this camera (and I generally hate reading reviews by people who don't own the product), I have owned a Polaroid camera of similar specs & price - with a CMOS lens. It mysteriously died in less than a year (company would service, but it would cost almost as much as purchase price for part) and picture quality was horrible. I regret not having done my research, b/c I took pics of my first baby with it and now with my second baby on a Canon, I can totally see the difference in quality.General tip I've learned: if the company doesn't have a history of making cameras (35mm cameras), then don't trust it! (Kodak and Fuji are probably OK, but not the best.) I remember Oregon Scientific from the calculators I used while I was flunking calculus...!"
3,out of stock,"while nightmare records were very helpful and tried to hunt down a rare CD for me, they were unable to."
4,bubble gum music lives!,"Hail to bobby sherman! Now HE WAS THE ULTIMATE PIN UP POSTER! WHAT A GOOD LOOKING MALE. BOBBY'S CD WAS ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO WHILE I WAS DOING MY NAILS AND JUST FLASHBACKING TO THAT ERA WHEN I WAS IN MY 'TWEENS'! WOW, WHAT AN ERA I WILL NEVER FORGET."
4,"Don't care if it's ""bubble gum"" pop -- it's fun music","Bobby Sherman had a great voice, and was perfect for the '60s/'70s era. While listening to this you truly are transported back in time. And I love his ""little known music"" which never was played along with his big hits. Speaking of which, ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" is really a good song! And frankly, can anyone honestly say they've never sung along to ""Julie, Do You Love Me?""?!!Bobby had what it took, singing and acting. I wish he'd stayed with it. But I'm sure there are many grateful people who are happy he became an EMT."
5,Another one as part of the package I bought,This was another of a three cd package I purchased. Was looking for something really great to buy myself for a belated Christmas present and found these cds. This one has a lot of songs on it that the other two don't so I was pleasantly surprised. It was way cool for a woman of my generation to be able to listen to some decent pop music for a change! And Bobby Sherman is the King of the Original Teen Idols!
4,Teenage angst,"I bought this item as a gift for my sister. She had such a crush on Bobby Sherman when she was a kid. I saw this and just couldn't pass up the opportunity to remind her of her teenage years. This particular album brought back memories. The ""Seattle"" Song has strong memories for both of us, as our favorite show at the time was, ""Here come the Brides"" and that song was the theme. I know that she enjoyed the music and nostalgia immensely."
4,Foma Fomitch Opiskin: Our 44th President!,"Let me address this review solely to those of you who don't much care for President Obama.I never thought of Dostoevsky as funny, but this is a masterful comedy about a sponger, manipulator, and conceited gasbag, and of the fawning victims off whom he lives happily ever after. For added enjoyment, translate the dynamics of that strange household in 19th century Russia to 2010 America, and you'll break out guffawing. ""Holy Cripes! We just put Foma Fomitch in the Oval Office!"" Promise!"
4,Beautiful,Dazzling Jessica Wakefield plans to enter herself in the first annual Sweet Valley pagaent.Her identical but serious twin Elizabeth is disgusted.She believes that pagaents are sexist and that they demean woman.The twins have one of their biggest rifts yet!Who will sacrifice what she believes in order to save the friendship.
2,Not worth the $,"This book sucks. Save your money, search the net and you'll find all the info you need. This book is more for kids than adults."
3,somewhat helpful book,The intention to provide information about the Rubicon Trail deserves applause - the result however is disappointing: The book provides very little helpful information. Despite many maps and pictures the book does not help a novice to navigate the trail.
3,It Was An Ok Book But Not A Keeper.,Full Circle by Carin Rafferty was an ok book. A doctor and single father named Sean Fitzgerald decides to help Whitney Price an unwed pregnant woman with a troubled past and winds up falling in love with her. It wasn't a keeper but it was an ok book that I enjoyed reading.
4,I should hold my tongue if I were you!,"Since I'm always on the lookout for good historical fiction, I'm surprised I've never heard of this author or series before, as it's clearly very popular and long running in Europe.I didn't bother to figure out which book in the series is the first, but began with this one and loved it. It takes place in 1323 and follows a pair of good friends around as they solve a murder mystery. The story is well done and feels authentic, but my favorite bits always involve the two friends, not unlike the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. There's a real warmth between them and I enjoyed all of their exchanges, this won't be the last book in this series I read, very pleasurable."
3,"good sound, doesn't charge","The unit has good sound and is very lightweight and eminently portable. I love the way it folds up, and it takes up almost no space on my desk. The only drawback is that it doesn't charge my iPod at all -- I think it actually drains more batteries than listening with headphones would. It's still a good deal without the charging aspect."
1,Don't go there!,"After 1 week the AC adapter no longer worked and after 2 weeks the unit refused to run at all on fresh batteries. ACCStation, from whom I ordered this, refused to return 4 messages as I wanted to exchange it. Don't order this unit and don't order anything from ACCStation."
3,pretty nice,"This speaker system has pretty good sound for the price, but i cannot get it to charge my ipod, which is very frusterating. I can work the controls perfectly fine while its plugged in, and its very portable. But if your looking for something that will charge your ipod, then you might want to consider something else."
1,OMG it killed my Ipod,"It came in a day earlier than expected, worked fine, even in the master bedroom (Master BD - 10 x 15 ft diameter), what I didnt expect for to happen was that there was a sticker on the item that says something like ""Turn off the speakers before removing your ipod or it may short circuit."" i heeded the warning and everything was fine for the first 2 days.... after then my ipod just died, the folder with an exclaimation mark appeared and wouldnt go away after everything i did, now i have to use my warranty to get a NEW one, just remember if u buy this, YOUR IPOD IS GOING TO DIE."
3,We need a better edition!,"Douglass is great--a true American hero--and it's very nice to have a good, affordable single-volume collection of his writings. But be warned that this edition has MANY typographical errors--on nearly every other page--and does not contain the original typographical style, which I think detracts from the experience. Still, it's a very handy reference to have around."
5,"A superb collection of speeches, writings, and reflections.","Frederick Douglas was one of the most important African American leaders of the 19th Century. He was a man who spoke and wrote with an unsurpassed eloquent on the issues confronting the American people during his life. His commentaries ranged from the abolition of slavery to women's rights, From the Civil War to racial lynchings, from American patriotism to black nationalism. Frederick Douglas: Selected Speeches and Writings was originally edited by Philip S. Foner and has been abridged and adapted in this superb ""The Library of Black America"" edition by Yuval Taylor. Frederick Douglas: Selected Speeches And Writings will form a core title in any personal, academic, or public library Black Studies collection."
1,Missing a speech.,"I was surprised to find that this book is missing the speech Frederick Douglass gave on December 7, 1869Boston, Massachusetts ""Our Composite Nationality""."
5,Offering a small glimpse at a truly BIG GOD!,"First off, the lyrics of the songs are gripping and reach right to your heart. Second, the harmony of The Imperials is fantastic anyway, but using the only female member of the group ever seems to intensify the harmonic blend. Third, the songs are personally touching and easy to sing with. This one is Great! I've had it for years & still find personal devotion time blessed using this music."
5,From personal experience,"Having received Yudansha directly from Otsuka Sensei in the1960's, this book along with my original Japanese LanguageMaster Test serves an historical as well as instructionalpurpose. Some of the proposed shortcomings by others arenegligible in my opinion being far outweighed by the benefitsof having a record in the words of Otsuka Sensei regarding thephilosophical foundations and insights of our style, Wado-Ryu.I recommend this book first to my students for the just statedreason and follow with other choices for their technical merits.Along with others I believe that nothing can replace being trained well. This book along with a good teacher will helpmaintain the true tradition of Wado-Ryu. Only years of experiencewill allow the reader to truly understand all that is expressedwithin the pages."
4,Upbeat song with dark lyrics,"I've enjoyed this song since the OHM disk came out in 1995. I thought Dave Navarro brought a more hard-rocking attack to RHCP on this disk, although this apparently didn't work so well for the band. Oh well, John cleaned up and came back...but that's another story.This song has a great hook for the chorus, upbeat singing, propulsive beat, excellent guitar work and of course Flea's awesome funk slap bass complete with a little solo in the middle of the song. It's a great song to turn up in the car.What concerns me is that the lyrics contain not-so-thinly veiled references...""pleasure spiked with pain..."", ""songbird sweet and sour Jane..."", ""push her voice inside of me, I'm overcoming gravity..."" and more. It's not so much the lyrics themselves, which work well with the song but that they had children singing on this song. Call me a square but although I like the song I think it was inappropriate."
1,This guy is overrated!,"This guy is terrible, The Neptunes ( the hottest Hip Hop/R'n'b producers ) are the ones that make his music (the fact songs such as 'Rock your body' were meant for Michael Jackson) - so for me it's easy to ignore his voice as it's their music. Apart from that, he's stealing michael jackson dance moves and his voice is unoriginal and not even that good either! Justin is for those who love soulless rubbish so for those who love real music, avoid it."
3,Written by a prole sometimes without parody,"This book starts out fun and informative. I DO want to figure out the class system which heretofore only occassionally reared its head when I cluelessly dressed or spoke inappropriately at a WASPy event and was met with the once over and raised eyebrows of an arbiter of the rules. I thought people lived differently because they wanted to, but this informs me that it is all regulated - which is neither or here nor there. Regardless, I was happy to read and consider the stand-ins for the levels but when I got to the chapter on the house, I hit the brakes. Obviously, this section was written in 1964 as it mentions Black & White TVs, the demise of the evening edition of the newspaper and the current political assassination. Yikes! Couldn't the author (or publisher) at least read the thing and update some of the references this go round? An au courant version would have been so entertaining - or am I being declasse?"
2,Too much of the same thing,"yes, there are some funny things here, but it gets old very very fast. read a paragraph in the bookstore and skip the rest."
2,Dated and overgeneralizing,"I suppose any book that attempts to sort everyone into categories by class is going to be guilty of generalizing and sterotyping. It would be easier to understand the charaterizations if they weren't so terribly dated now - while the copyright is 1983, based on the TV shows cited I suspect the ideas might be a bit earlier. There are things that mention answering machines and microwaves, and it's hard to remember what I thought about them when they were first showing up; and of course all sorts of fashions in houses, clothes and so on have shifted the markers. But much is based on occupations, and given the depth of the changes in the job market as blue-collar jobs went overseas and white collar workers were replaced by computers, there are quite a few observations that just don't make sense any more.However, it's still fairly interesting reading. 25 years ago, I'd probably have given 4 stars - the author does do a certain amount of sneering and superiority that is grating."
3,"Interesting, But Inaccurate and Dated","A slightly amusing book, which comes across as dated and rather poorly researched. Fussell twists himself (and his sources) into contradiction at some points, and on the whole it's a pretty amateur effort: don't read this expecting any sort of sociological rigour.Interesting, but I'm pretty disappointed: this was not nearly as good as I expected from reading other reviews. It's a little sparse on any real information, and a whirlwind tour of stereotypical class differences rather than a substantial treatment of the subject."
3,"Fussell, CLASS","Dianne Hunter's ReviewThis 1983 sociological study of status markers in America, written with the sensibility of an 18th-century satirist, is observant as to appearances, occasionally hilarious, and irritatingly snide. Paul Fussell, a middle-class academic and historian, systematically differentiates 6 classes of USA residents according to their drinks, degrees of body fat, reading habits, physiognomy, clothes, comportment, vocabulary, sports, living rooms, driveways, lawn furniture, and cars. This slightly tedious and relentlessly invidious account refers throughout to members of the working class as ""proles."" Fussell thinks everybody in the USA suffers from status anxiety. He admires bohemians, who he thinks are aristocrats without money."
5,Reality is so hard for people ...,"This is by far one of the most detailed and accurate assessments of the American class system. It is timeless as well as thorough. Although this book was written in 1983, human nature does not change, which makes this book's assertions just as valid today. Fussell does not necessarily condone classism, he just calls it as he sees it.This book gives its readers a perfect understanding of America's (subtle?) caste system in an aggressive, concise, and tongue-in-cheek style."
3,Good But Not His Best,Paul Fussell is always good but this is not his best. Mostly it reads as a little dated. Most of his work remains timeless.
3,Dated even at the time it was published,Fussell is an excellent writer but this book seemed curiously out of date even for 1983. It almost seems as if it was written by an expatriate who hadn't been home in 20 years and was just working off memory.
2,Note: Reviewer shares many of author's frustrations,"this book makes you hate other people (and yes, i have a sense of humor)."
1,guide for judging people you haven't even met,"If you want to know how to judge your fellow man based on his appearance rather than his qualities, then this book is for you. Caution: it also contains objectionable language."
3,"Amusing, but dated","As a curmudgeon myself and a card-carrying cynic I enjoyed Fussel's trenchant wit. He absolutely hits the mark in skewering social norms... as they were in the 1980s. But almost 20 years have passed since the book's 1983 publication, and the tirade has not aged so well. New trends have upended many of the traditional class relations Fussel took aim at, and at least 2 new social classes have developed since then (results of the technology and information booms of the last 15 years) while others have begun fading into irrelevence. Read this book if you remember how class lines were drawn in the 1980s -- especially if you were bothered by them -- but look elsewhere if you want humor or insight on contemporary society."
3,Eye-Opening,"Paul Fussell, one of our own here in Oregon, has died today at the age of 88. I only knew him through this one book of his, which was a fun and clever, if a bit unnerving (for me) comic portrait of lifestyle traits of various socio-economic classes in America. Naturally as a middle class (as opposed to ""middle class"") American I came into the book believing that there was no such thing, but came out convinced otherwise. Whatever his intent, I emerged able to spot signs of climbing and pretense in my peers in academia by giveaway nuances, and my view of them never quite recovered; it also indirectly changed (damaged) my view of Nietzsche forever. Thanks Paul. Class act."
4,good,"This is a very interesting book. I took the test at the end, scoring points as I walked through my living room, pleased my living room held all the elements of an upperclass one. If I'd scored lower, I might have thought this book a worthless piece of tripe! It is caustic and arrogant at times (how could it not be, really.) Mostly entertaining, though, and often eye-opening."
2,Vintage Fussell. aka CRAP,"What you see is not what you get. Ostensibly a critique of our social classes, particularly the pathetically insecure MIDDLE CLASSES, this book is yet another opportunity for the late Paul Fussell to express his elitist disdain for most of the rest of us. He excels in revealing the mediocrity of most of our colleges and universities but what he is really after is the celebration of X-Class members like himself. X'ers are those whom others would call bohemians or over-aged hippies. I wouldn't have him or them to dinner even. They might steal the sterling silver."
2,"A dated, trite & slightly amusing outline of consumer spending habits by class, c.1983","The bulk of this book is dedicated to consumer spending habits and while much has changed over the last 25 years (original copyright of 1983), there is a considerable amount that has stayed the same. There are some nuggets, but they are few and far between.It is a light and fluffy distraction easily dispensed with in an afternoon. Those with a serious sociological interest would be far more satisfied with the work of Mills.Just be sure to get it from the library, your bookshelves would not be complimented by it's presence."
2,funny but mean spirited and self serving,"Fussell's serious works, most notably The Great War and Modern Memory, are masterpieces. In this book, however, he lets his nastiness roam far afield. The entire book is an elegy to himself and those he deigns worthy of his attention. It's a romp for the first few pages, but just gets more and more spiteful as it moves along."
5,watch the microsurgical comic exploration unfold,"here's a hint to those upset by Fussell's ""coldness"" or negativity toward middles & proles - Fussell is a humorist AND lay-sociologist. He is not being mean-spirited. He lays into every caste with equal joyful criticism.If you think he is mean, you simply do not understand his sense of humor.Alsot, to those who believe that Category X has anything to do with Coupland's ""Generation X"" or Brooks's Bobos, you are dead wrong. Category X is not generational, AND it is not populated by the shrill, self-indulgent materialists lambasted in Brooks's ""Bobos in Paradise."""
4,"So close to 5 stars, but....","This book is politically incorrect.It is also very entertaining.I saw many people I've met it it, me included.Although the book is 2 decades old, it holds up well as a scathing look at middle class America.The only thing I found annoying was Fussell contempt of religion.To equate Christianity as being a mark of only low class people is stupid.Other than that glaring bit, it's fascinating."
2,Professor Fussell needs a lesson,"Save your money, don't buy Class: A Guide Through the American Status System. This book is hopelessly out of date, and merely contains the rants of an elderly, bitter, opinionated snob. Some examples of his bizarre, small-minded way of thinking: only people from the east or west coast of America have any class, one can only get a true education at an Ivy League school, and people who are happy & smile are low class. The only reason the book merited 2 stars is because he comes up with a ""Class X"" at the end, for those who can't be categorized."
2,"funny, cruel","Fussell himself admitted that this book was possibly too mean-spirited, and his title points out that it really isn't about class but status. So, he's using the word ""class"" in the sense of ""that dame ain't got no class.""And, for that reason, the book is really pernicious, making us think that status is something that actually matters. Fussell may feel that his superior education gives him the right to look down on fat women in stretch pants, but Dick Cheney, with his prole's jutting jaw and crummy degree, still decides the energy policy of the US and gets us into a stupid war, a war incidentally that the likes of Paul Fussell would have been forced to fight in before he got that superior degree."
2,Very disappointing,"Most of the interesting comments in the book are quotes or direct references from The Preppy Handbook (which is actually an interesting and funny read). A couple of other interesting points made, but many of the author's other ""insights"" are either so obvious they're not worth mentioning or are off base. If this type of topic interests you, The Preppy Handbook is a much better read."
4,As notable for whom it omits as for whom it includes,"Paul Fussell's book CLASS is slightly tongue-in-cheek but still very informative --- on the classes it does deal with, that is. He is virtually silent about blacks, Jews, Asians, and Hispanics, choosing instead to concentrate on the white ""upper"" and ""middle"" classes, with a lot of emphasis upon the former. Taken totally seriously, it would be a discouraging read as he insinuates that the only worthwhile college education is from one of the ""better"" schools, the middle class is in virtual slavery (to wages and others' opinions), and so on. His chapter on ""X"" class is the highlight of the entire book!"
2,On the lame side,"If I were Jilly Cooper, I would have been rather upset with this book, which borrows exceedingly heavily from her book of the same title. Fussell quotes it extensively, borrowing much of the format and most of the ideas from her book, which predates his. If you want a book on class, get Cooper's, which was just released in a new edition. It's just as funny and not nearly as rude. Fussell says no class is better than another, but Cooper clearly believes it. One gets the impression that Fussell read Cooper's book and thought to himself ""Gee, somebody should write one of these about the United States!"" And did. But Cooper was first and better."
5,A real consciousness-raiser!,"I've re-read this book several times in the last ten years. It is somewhat ascerbic and somtimes tongue-in-cheek, but I can say from personal experience with the various classes ranging from upper-middle down through mid-prole, it is full of useful and interesting insights. Unfortunately, it makes me even more self-conscious about my tastes (which may have been a mean-spirited intention of Fussell's). But that's my problem."
3,Fussell's book in need of clarification,"I agree with both the positive and negative comments addressed in these reviews; it's funny, observant, mean-spirited, and haphazardly written.A couple of comments to potential readers. First, everything will make sense if you substitute your existing definition of Upper Middle Class with Fussell's definition of Middle Class. This alone generated confusion and doubt about his observations until I made that distinction.Second, expect to be disappointed to find out you have characteristics from at least 3 or more classes. Those looking to pigeon-hole themselves into a single class will be disappointed, unless you're part of the despicable category X."
3,A little bit of a disappointment,"A pretty interesting album, if you ask me. It appears as if Peter Furler is the only Newsboy from this group that is still with the band. Not quite the style you know them for today. The only reason I really like it is the fact that it is, in fact, Newsboys. As a collector, I recommend it only for collectors sake, otherwise I'd pass it up...I'm sorry to say."
5,Tests on the CD-ROM are practical and effective.,"The tests on the CD-ROM are practical and effective. Timing on questions and metrics displayed are useful to measure progress in learning. There is no other product on the market that can give you extensive training on the ASVAB tests like this CD.I noticed that some users had issues with installing the product, such as Norton Antivirus terminating the installation due to the presence of a virus W95.CIH.Corrupt. After investigating I found that this is a problem with the Norton Antivirus package. Norton Antivirus 2004 or earlier versions, with current virus definitions via live update (virus definitions after August, 2003), is buggy and wrongly detects that an installation file is infected! Similar problems may exist with McAfee as well.A patch is available online that will fix this problem. (...)Hope this helps. Good luck with the ASVAB!"
1,Still Has A Virus After Knowing About It For 3 Years,"I ordered the Barrons How to Prepare for the ASVAB with CD Rom for a Christmas present. The main reason I selected it was because of the CD, and I felt my son would probably be more willing to study something on the computer. When I tried to load the program, found there was a serious virus on the CD. I sent emails to the Customer Service department reporting the problem, and to ask for a new CD, but they have never responded. Now after reading other reviews I see this problem has been around on the CD since 2003 over 3 years. I find this inexcusable on Barrons part not to have resolved the issue in this time frame. I feel this product should be immediately be pulled from the market. I'm surprised that Amazon seeing these reviews about the virus hasn't allready done so. Don't waste your money on this product, especially if your buying it because of the corrupted CD ROM program."
1,Virus on the CD-ROM,"The book seems good. However, The main reason I chose this study guide was the included CD-ROM. When installing the program on my computer, Norton Anti-Virus detected a virus. The ""W95.CIH.corrupt"" virus at 61% of the install process. After reading about this virus, I tried an install with anti-virus turned off. The ASVAB program would not run. I contacted the Tech support at 510-796-9608, (per the setup menu). The english was so poor on the automated message, I had no idea which selection to make. At the end, I left a message and have not yet heard from them. So far, the CD-ROM is useless."
1,"Useful study guide -- but too many errors, and a virus on CD","This book was useful as a preparation guide for the ASVAB, but it was clear that the publisher didn't spend much time proofreading it. There were numerous spelling and grammatical errors, and the practice tests had several questions with wrong answers and/or bad explanations. In one case the question consisted of a statement and choices without any question! I expected better from Barron's. We didn't use the CD at all because we also had the virus problem mentioned in another review below."
2,Buy a different book!,"To be fair, I've given it 2 stars. That's because: 1) it WAS a multiple choice test; 2) it WAS broken up into sections; and 3) I did take it on the computer. If you're looking for understanding the test in theory, this book will work. Otherwise, the similarity ends there. Other than the example questions, NOT ONE of the questions in this book was on the exam I took (the example questions on the test are the same or similar to the example questions in the book). I just looked at another book advertised here on Amazon and it has at least one of the questions that was on my test (""The Best Test Prep for the ASVAB""). In addition, there was a section in the exam that was not in this book - it's about putting shapes together. It would have been nice to be able to practice that ahead of time. Finally, if you are able to get the CD working, the CAT test on the CD allows you to go back and review your answers; the actual ASVAB CAT does not! Do yourself a favor and buy the other book!"
4,Excellent !,"An excellent report about Mecca, although the comments are a little different as on the sunna (Moslem Traditions), such as for example the history of Abraham and well of other subjects. However, the documentary is new for those which would like to know Mecca and its importance in the heart of a Moslem. In connection with South-African which was seen directing towards the camp-site of Africans of its country in the place to be with everone, it is especially not an act of racism: what he did not understand, nor the producers of the documentary, in the Mecca, the camp-sites are by countrys, so that when one loses oneself or his self, he can find or to be easily direct towards the camp-site of his country."
5,Inside Mecca,I needed something by which I could introduce the Islamic religion to my students and this proved to be perfect
1,Disappointed,"The book seemed to drag somewhat. The story was about a rich spoiled young lady that was bored with her life and decided to switch lives with her poor friend. Even though she grew up with the poor friend, she did not have a clue the struggles she went thru each day. The rich girl becomes struck on her boss. The hero/boss is a self proclaimed Christian that asks the heroine/rich girl to sleep with him..... This is where the book lost me all together.I was shocked and disappointed that Love Inspired Books would allow this book to pass thru the editing process. I have not read all of their books, but I have read a lot of them and have never read a book where the Christian hero/heroine requests sex without the benefit of marriage. The Christian is to honor and respect those that we love and set an example to those that do not know God as we do. If we do not, then we are of this world and not of His."
1,(...),"With the exception of perhaps 3 songs this CD has to be one of the worst Twiztid CD's I'v ever heard. The Intro does an excellent job on hyping up the listener but as soon as the 2nd track kicks in your just about ready to fast foward to the next track in hope that it'll get better from there. As far as I'm concerned the only Twiztid CD worth spending the money on is Mostasteless and perhaps both Cryptic Collections, The rest are complete and utter (...)."
2,?,"I don't understand. Mirror/mirror was an EP with B-sides and side projects, and it was better than this. GOD! Every song has the same drum pattern. They put out a version of ""The World is Hell"" on their website that was much better than the remix here. Get Mostasteless if you've never listened to Twitid before.It start out okay but gets bad really fast. It picks up with Frankestein. Every Dies and Hom Sha Bom almost make up for the sh*t tracks. Fat Kids is boring and has bad rapping, but there's a line in the song that makes it all worth it. Darkness gives the album a really anticlimatic feel. It's like failed attempt to make a boring grunge song.This just feels like nu-metal or techno. Really repetitive."
2,Dissapointing,"After listening to the entire CD, it is nowhere nearly as good as I was expecting it to be.Out of all of Twiztid's albums this far, the beats on this CD are by the worst. They all (with a few exceptions) have the same drum pattern, and all come out sounding boring and repetetive. I was looking forward to listening to ""The World is Hell"" with the added verse by Esham on the album, because the version that they posted on their website was very good. Apparantly they decided to remix the song for the album, and gave it a beat that was much slower than the original, and sounds like most of the other beats on the album. I think that they were trying to be ""experimental"" on this CD, but the way it turned out, it's hard to listen to the CD all the way through, and it has very little replay value.The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of the few listenable tracks (Nikateen and Serial Killa) and because the artwork/packaging is creative."
1,Dumbest Cd Ever,This Cd Is byfar the worst cd they ever made dumb beats and dumb Lyrics.I didnt even Buy this cd i downloaded 5 songs and thats all i need to hear.The world is Hell sounds retarted so dont even bother buying this cd.And Just think they want to stop people from downloading Mp3.If i would of bought this cd i would be unhappy with a Cd i would never Listin too.So to finish it all up this cd is a waste of money and sounds like they got drunk and high one night and put this whole cd together
2,Nothing new - Songs sound the same,If you liked Mirror/Mirror then you will like this CD. Same beat through out the CD. Most likely my last Twizted CD...Motasteless is by far a Classic CD. They need a better beat to their music it gets really old by the fourth song.
5,the greatest,"i have been waiting for this book for years , and it is as good as i hoped ,the book is a inside look at the man who controled the wrestling world for more then 10 years as world champion.harleys caring for his sport shows in this book. the chapter where he discribes the meeting and scuffle with vince jr is a eye opener.i call it a must read for any wrestling fan.the only draw back i would say is that the book is to short 200 pages.harley could have gone on for a 1000 pages about his wrestling. overall a great book ,ps harley thanks for the great memories gary,from buffalo"
5,"Hilarious, quick read","Though Philip Pullman is most well known for the ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy and the Sally Lockhart mysteries he has also written several short funny books for kids. THE FIREWORK MAKER'S DAUGHTER takes place in a surreal world that has Chinese, Indian and fairy tale influences. Lila, is the firework maker's daughter who dreams of following in her father's footsteps while he thinks she needs to concentrate on finding a husband. Against her father's wishes she journeys to fulfill her dream and encounters many amusing characters and adventures along the way. This is a quick read as it is less than 100 pages including several illustrations and would make a great read aloud since it is filled with witty dialogue and amusing descriptions. I WAS A RAT and CLOCKWORK are two other good books by Pullman that are fun, fast yet still well written tales."
4,Follow your dreams!,"Lila knows exactly what she wants to be when she grows up. She's been studing the trade since she was little. Lila wants to be a firework-maker like her dad.Lila learns everything there is to learn about fireworks, she thinks. Her father has held back the knowledge of the journey every firework- maker must make before they be a true firework-maker. Lila is furious at that her father doesn't trust her enough to tell her.She finds out about the journey and sets off to the mountian to bring back the one ingredient that every firework-maker must have. She'll let nothing get in her way, not even pirates and erupting volcanos.I really enjoyed this book and think it's a good book for anyone who can read, to read."
3,book by Colin Fletcher,The quality of paper is less than I expected. Having read a previous copy I was smewhat disapointed but glad to have my own copy.
4,Great buy for the money!,Great lashes for $16. Went on easy..had to trim a bit the only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because they didn't flare out at the ends..was same length as inner corner lashes. But all in all once you put them on they look great! Great for day wear!
4,Stay! Keeper's Story by Luxor,"Stay! Keeper's Story was a pretty good book, where homelessness has taken a few of the characters. I think that this book was a little difficult to read because of some HUMONGOUS words. There were also a LOT of French words. The story was about a nameless pup, the 2nd of 4: who was separated from his siblings and abandoned by his mother. He was heart broken that he lost his dear sister, Wispy. So he went out on the street, looking for her. While he was on the street, he met a homeless guy named Jack. Next, he went on to live with a photographer. Finally, he went to live with a child and her mother. The pup gets many different names along with the changing of his owner. If you want to find out more details about this book, and find out if the pup gets reunited with a loved one, YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
4,Stay Review by Yancovic,"Do you ever wonder what a dog's point of view of the world is?In Stay Keeper's Story you can find out!!! This intersting novel will tell you the story of an abandoned dog on a mission to find his sister and to defeat his enemy,Scar. I would recomend this book for ages eleven and up. One aspect of the book I did not like though was that the vocabulary was extremely sophisticated."
1,"They came not to honor Reagan, but to bury him","I wanted an historic overview of the Reagan presidency - what I got was a c-span like account of his state funeral. No footage of Reagan alive - no historic news clips of when he was a vital human being - just dirges, speeches, and very slow marching. If it weren't a DVD, I would return it."
4,Kinetic Faith - Bride,"Although not as good as ""Show No Mercy"" or ""Live to Die"" this is still an excellent Cd. Troubled Times is a great song and also was made into a cool music video. In my opinion one of the most unique songs Bride has ever done is ""Sweet Louise"" a tribute to Dale and Troy's Grandmother. I love the mandolin in this song."
1,Great Christian Rock,Bride is Rock with a mesage. So much rock is based upon the world. Not Dale and Troy Thompson. These guys have been rocking since the late 1980's Kinetic faith is Awsome as mosst all of Brides stuff.
5,Boost of Confidence,I love this book. I've read it so many times. My old copy turned yellow and had markings all over it so when I heard about a friend's troubles I decided to get a brand new copy so that I could loan it out. I reccomend this book to everyone; especially those going through a stage in life that they are not quite certain of. We all go through so many life stages that can sometimes confuse us of how we feel about ourselves. I learn something new about myself every time I read this book. It gives me a fresh point of view that opens my mind to new thoughts and gives me a boost of confidence.
2,Dated and psychoanalytic,"This book was not helpful to me, in fact, it was a little upsetting. It reminded me, with the dialogue format, of some of the ""channeling"" books (like Seth or the Course on Miracles), but without even the substance of those books.Rather, the authors seemed to concentrate on people's childhood troubles, just as a psychoanalyst would, regressing them so as to uncover the beginnings of their psychological problems.This, to me, is not a useful procedure, but obviously, some people are helped by it. For those who cannot afford psychotherapy, maybe this little book is a fair substitute.I personally would need something a little more substantial and down-to-earth. Diximus."
1,Pages Missing!,"I received the book which must have been a very old copy, yellowed pages and there were about 25 pages missing. I didn't even want to touch the book! Definitely a waist of money!"
4,A Great Ointment (with an enormous fly in it).,"I love this book. It is simple yet profound and can be extremely helpful for adult survivors of childhood abuse. However, the paragraph on p.20 about ""successfully"" getting homosexuals to turn heterosexual is wrong. It turned my stomach. The book is about feeling good about yourself, encouraging yourself and having a better and happier life. Those things will not happen if a person is ashamed of being homosexual. The book is a great ointment, but it has a fly in it."
5,Great motivation to improve one's life,"I picked this up off my parent's shelves to have something to read on a plane - 1971 version - and by the time I landed had taken two pages of notes about how to improve my life. The concepts are easy to remember and east to implement, and the book is a short, easy read. The best element I took from the book is the value of time - each of our choices have consequences, and time in life is limited - one can break bad habits by making the right choices and understanding that making these choices will help one be happy. Good, quick read!"
5,An Easter book suggestion - could become a family classic!,"I read this book in a mall book store today. It has delightful illustrations, in simple but bright colors. Not one of those overly hectic try to impress the art world books. The story is simple, with those repeat sentences that young listeners love to echo...or shout out. The animals have a fuzzy texture. I am ordering this for the grandchildren for Easter! And can't wait to read it to them."
2,Little Lamb,"Little Lamb is a very cute story about a little lamb named fleecy who was very energetic. Fleecy would be so full of energy that she wouldn't be able to sleep while all the other lamb's were. Then Fleecy's mother began giving her idea's on how to fall asleep. As in Counting stars and clouds, but once they realized there wouldn't always be stars or clouds, fleecy began to count the sheep."
1,Terrible,"The atomic clock didn't sync up after 48 hours on standby (the manual recommends at least 24), the temperature reader is off by 5 degrees, and the weather forecast promises only 70% accuracy (which means I check my computer for a *real* forecast each morning anyway). So what you have is a self-setting clock that you have to manually set yourself, a thermometer that you have to mentally adjust downward by 5 degrees, and a forecaster that provides a rough but useless idea of the day's weather. If the above is not enough to dissuade you, consider this: (1) the touch screen buttons are absolutely useless in the morning when your hand-eye coordination is at its worst, (2) the clock's ""snooze"" button annoyingly becomes a ""sleep"" button after several minutes of radio/ringing, (3) the radio reception on this in my area is worse than any other radio I have tried, and (4) as others have mentioned, the clock is invisible when the lights are off."
2,Looks better than it works,"I needed a clock radio to fit a small space in my bathroom and thought this would be perfect. Unfortunately with the lack of a constant back light, poor am radio reception and marginally responsive and generally annoying soft touch buttons, it was anything but. More often than not, when I tried to steady the unit to change a setting, I ended up touching a button that changed a different setting. I'll find a spot for it somewhere, but I purchased aMaverick R-395 Color-Coded LCD Weather Station and AM/FM Radio with Atomic Alarm Clock (Silver)for the bathroom. Far superior."
1,It's possesed!,"Along with the others that complain of the touch sensitivity and low light my clock seems to have a mind of it's own where it randomly starts beeping and turning the radio on and off. This is NOT good function at 3am and you are trying to sleep. No it's not the alarm because there is no rhythem to the beeping, just chaotic. The outdoor temp never sends it's signal and my nightstand is a little higher then my head so since the clock is slightly angled I can't read it at all, even with the dayglo on. This causes me to have to reach for the clock and tilt it to read... at which point my fingers hit the sensitive touch buttons and all hell breaks loose."
4,Very Nice Clock-Radio,Works vry nicely and I like the fact that when the alarm goes off the backlight stays lit long enough to see the time and temps.
2,Too thin to work,"Ditto the other 1-star review - it needs to be thicker and is so smooth that it always comes out clean. Worthless as a cake tester. Use a toothpick, and visual. I actually use this product for two things other than its original purpose: 1) I work w/ chocolate curls a lot, and since using my fingers would make them melt and is clumsy, this works wonderfully to pick up each curl individually and place on item to be decorated. 2)I also use it to pick off crumbs that have strayed on the top of a dessert (I decorate a lot of cheesecakes and cakes with chopped up toffee, chocolate, cookies, espresso beans, etc. and it is very hard to keep them all in their intended places."
3,"Does the job, but nothing special.","I have one of these I bought 10 years ago, I think it was Betty Crocker brand; this one I purchased for a second home. While it is adequate and certainly does the job, the metal is a lot thinner than my old one - I can flex the metal on this one while the old one is rigid. The rubber part is a bit small but not uncomfortable or difficult to grasp with 2 fingers. I paid $5 for it which I think is a little high considering what it is."
2,cake tester,This is exactly as stated and will save on toothpicks for sure! I like the fact that it will pierce farther than a toothpick to ensure doneness.
4,Oxo Good Grips Cake Tester,"This was combined with multiple items I ordered that day and for some reason I could only leave the other seller feedback, so, here I give my review. We haven't used it but the packaging was quite sufficient for the trip. It has that neat handle, which I surmise, is heat resistent. I gave 4 stars only because I haven't used it yet. When we do I will return with another critique. I could very well raise to 5 stars - it this system will allow such actions. WLL"
3,"Ok, but thin","I have only used this cake tester once so far, and I overcooked my cake, but it wasn't actually the testers fault because I didn't test it until it was already overcooked. My concern with the product is that the metal tester is very thin, kind of like a thick needle, and I don't know if it's thick enough to grab the cake batter and pull it out to let you know the cake is undercooked...I guess it could be designed so thin for people that don't want a visible hole poked in the top of their cake. On the upside the grip part is nice and big and easy to hold on to."
2,Why pay for this when a toothpick works just as well?,"There's nothing magic with this product. Works like a toothpick would. This is for the cook who prefers to have everything ""modern""."
1,Never Shows Goo (and that's BAD),"My daughter snapped my old cake tester and I didn't realize that all cake testers were not created equal when I bought this Oxo one. sighhhhh It's got a nice handle for pinching between my fingers, sure, but the skinny wire doesn't really show if the batter is still gooey when I poke something that's baking. My old cake tester (sighhh again) had a little flattened piece on the end of the stick and THAT successfully showed any goo whereas this Oxo cake tester never shows goo.Oh well. It's useful for popping the bubbles in my loaves of bread before their final rise."
1,It's too thin to work well.,This tester looks thicker in the photos than it actually is. It's quite a bit more thin than your average toothpick. It's so thin that it always comes out clean for me when I use it. I test with this cake tester and it comes out clean but a thin knife like I normally use comes out soupy. It's a neat product but it needs to be thicker.
5,Cake Tester,This good grips cake tester is okay. I love to bake and this works pretty good. I use it all the time I bake
4,great for the finer things in life,"I have a Cuisinart Cake Tester and this Oxo. This one bends easier, but I prefer to use it for finer cakes or cupcakes. The thicker Cuisinart tester surely stands up well, but also punctures a wide hole in a cake. Using that one on a cupcake really sticks a noticable hole in the smaller item and using it on let's say an Angel Food Cupcake almost destroys it. Having two widths gives me more versatility in my baking choices.I am here ordering another of these Oxo's because I used this one to pick up dipped marshmallows from chocolate and of course it is completely bent up. Unfortunately, the thicker Cuisinart left such a big hole in the marshmallows that they were unsightly, IF they didn't slide completely back off the wire."
5,I KNOW A GIRL,"Settie's song ""I Know A Girl"" is awesome. Who can't relate to wanting to be everything your not? Awesome lyrics..awesome voice..awesome song."
3,I heard a song I liked....,"The song that stuck with me throughout the movie.. well, when it was playing, was... ""If I don't tell you now"" it's the slow song that plays during those sappy moments... Just incase you guys were wondering which song it was, I was waiting for the credits to scroll by to see what the title was, and yup, it's, If I don't tell you now. Check it out."
4,GREAT soundtrack!,"First, let me just say the movie was ok. Not too original, but still a good hour and half popcorn love story anchored by very charming performances from Prinze and Forlani. But the soundtrack is a different story! I really liked it, it's a perfect road trip cd, when you need to dance or just relax. In particular, Ronan Keating's ""If I Don't Tell You Now"" is very well written (but I preferred the other vwersion, guys help me out here, who sang that? It played during the scenes after Prinze and Forlani talked about their night, I beg of you, WHO is that singer???)Overall, very good soundtrack, although I wish that the original (or revived not sure) version of If I Don't Tell You Now and Vertical Horizon's Everhting You Want weren't included. Worth a purchase, though. :)"
4,great as the movie !!,"I LOVED the movie ! I was crying and all emotioned. After the movie I came home and ordered the cd. I loved it ! But especially 1, 4,5, 9, 14 ! i remembered all the parts of the movie like if I was watching it again ! Really recomended it for everything ( dancing # 9)(slow clams song #5,) (just fun song #14) !"
3,Duncan Sheik steals the cd!,"This cd is so-so. There's half the cd of good songs, and half of the cd with bad songs. If you loved the movie, you'd love this cd. Duncan Sheik clearly steals the cd with his new song ""Now or Never."" I suggest if you like a certain song, buy the artists album."
4,great movie,hi! i just want to say that this was a great movie.....i really do think that it shows just how girls want in a guy.....a friend and astud!! could somebody tell me whats the name of the song that is playing in the club when the two go dancing....by the way freddie looks so cute dancing!!!! thank you!!! ciao!!!!
4,Coffee Shop Song,"The song playing in the back ground at the coffee shop was ""Nothing But You"" by Kim Ferron... Hope this helps... :-)"
3,Subtitles need to go!,"I was disappointed that the subtitles couldn't be turned off. That really should be indicated on the information page. I wanted to use it for my German students. Usually I try to buy German versions in Germany, but I wasn't able to get it the last time there. So, it's pretty much useless as a teaching tool, since the students would be reading the English subtitles. Ah well, live and learn. I'll just have to find someone in Germany to find me a copy without English. Money ill spent."
4,The child's rescue only started the nightmare,"Frank Roscoe saved the Mellanby's young son from drowning, but gradually they find themselves entangled in a nightmare situation when they invite him to stay at their house.Gripping and ingenious, with a trademark Garve surprise ending."
5,Excellent product and service,"I have ordered the perfume before, but from a different vendor. I was impressed with their delivery time and the product was just as advertised. I will reorder from this vendor again."
2,It was alright,"I bought this because I smelled it on one of my patients, and loved it! But when I got it and tried it on myself. I felt I smelled like an older lady..."
5,Excelet Product,"Excellent product recommended, very good for use during the day, has a fresh aroma and smooth .. Very rich for everyone"
2,Disappointing,I was on the States on vacation and wanted to buy this perfume to give to a friend as a gift. Here in Brazil it is very expensive. I found this nice offer at Amazon.com and ordered it. The fragance is awesome. My disappointment with this purchase is due to the fact that in any moment they advertised it as a refurbished or not new item. When I received the package the perfume's box was totally opened and the seller sent me a note saying that the perfume was used once (or something like that). I felt cheated and was very angry but couldn't send it back and ask for a refund cause I was coming back to my country. I have bought at Amazon.com before and it never happened. Really disappointing.
1,Noa perfume,"I purchased Noa because I can't find it in stores. Unfortunately, the fragrance is similar to the original Noa but unusual. Also, it doesn't last for longer than 10 minutes. The original Noa would last all day. I don't know if the bottle that I purchased is just too old, and thus ""gone bad"", or if it is a poor copy. Needless to say, I am very disappointed and will not buy it again. For $53, I thought I had a bargain. It was definitely a waste of money. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C1Z2AU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title)"
3,Disappointed,I paid $62.50 for this product and did not expect to get a tester with a barcode stucked over the tester sign. Testers clearly state that they are not for resale. The spray top is also broken. What a rip-off!
1,"DO NOT ORDER FROM TUCCINI IN N.Y,","I LOVE THIS PERFUME!!!WENT TO REORDER ONLINE, ORDERED FROM TUCCINI THROUGH AMAZON.WHAT I RECEIVED WAS WATER IN A CACHEREL BOTTLE.HAVE RETURNED IT, BUT WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THEM.THEY HAVE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH THE BBB IN NEW YORK.I WILL BUY NOW FROM WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY SMELL IT FIRST!"
5,All time Favorite..,This is my all time favorite cologne. nothing else comes close to it.. and the compliments on it is far more than any other I have ever used. Smells FANTASTIC!!!
2,Weak stories.,"Nothing in this collection is really terrible, but nothing in it has anything to offer either. Mostly, they're just borring. ""A Medal for Harry"" has a nice (and humorous) twist at the end, but not much else going for it. Most of the writers are technically competent, but the stories are simply week."
3,A few missing highlights,"Can't go higher than 3 stars here folks, I was incorrectly under the assumption that this DVD contained video of dog tortures. I feel that it is reasonable to expect video recordings of pot smoking, dog killing, and prison yard rape. Shouldn't we know the entire person? I feel cheated."
2,"Start=Great, End=Bad","Product performed as expected and was easy to assemble and use. Legs and fasteners are not made of stainless steel and legs have adjustment holes which allow water to enter. In less than 6 months the rust had eaten through the inside of the legs so it was unusable. I had dumped the water out of each leg after each shower, but it still rusted."
3,King of the PDA,"Ever since I bought my 565 I have loved it. It has been my trusted companion. It also makes a supperior MP3 Player, as it syncs well with Windows Media Player on my PC. It also is the perfect medium to write letters (Pocket Word), Manage your money and investment (MS Money for PPC), The best universal remote(TV Remote), and a better note taker that a giant Tablet PC. And it has a wonderfull hard cover to protect the screen. Despite loving it so much, It is impossable to find parts for it in Canada. Since it is discontinued you can not get a replacement stylus, or assesories. And I've had to get the screen replaced once, and the second time is comming soon. And the dust is impossable to get out."
1,WITHOUT UPGRADE,"Hewlett-Packard support have just tell me that they will not upgrade any Jornada to Pocket PC 2003 operating system, and they will only support Compaq I-Pac as HP I-Pac mainstream Pocket PCs. I bought in Amazon a Jornada 565 in May 2002, and now I have an obsolete tool. I think this is very unfair. I have invested ... in the Jornada 565 and Hewlett-Packard forgets his customers to only give upgrades to Compaq customers. If you are thinking about buying an HP product, think twice: maybe they are thinking to merge with anybody else and live you without support."
4,what i was looking for,"Its just the right size for my warmer weather hunting gear. Its a great bag for storage and scent control .Im a predator hunter so keeping my camo seperated from my other clothing is a must. I put a cover scent wafer in the bag and when I open the bag my clothing smells like dirt, a good thing. I would recomend it to any serious hunter."
4,Know what you drink,"Knowing how many particulates are in your water helps you decide how to use that water; drinking, cooking, washing, plant irrigation, etc. Living in the Phoenix, AZ area guarantees safe but hard, particle-rich water. The Intellitec tester consistently gives the following readings (in ppm, or parts per million):Outside faucet: 700 - 800 (local water has daily variations in quality)Bottled, flavored drinking water: 500 - 600Inside faucet (softener, whole-house filter with standard cartridge ... GE FXUSC): 450Inside faucet (softener, whole house filter with carbon sediment cartridge ... GE FXWTC): 350Reverse osmosis dedicated faucet: 35The Intellitec tester confirms our decision to use the RO water for drinking and cooking ... and to avoid commercially bottled water.The only ""con"" I have is the tester's on/off switch. It works inconsistently; one has to get used to the correct amount of pressure for it to turn on!"
2,inaccurate,"shipped quick, item is inaccurate,can not be calibrated,converson factor is unknown I estmate it to be .700~.850. simly not worth the shipping."
3,Review Digital Water Tester,We owned the exact same tester and it failed after a year. We are hoping this lasts longer. Works well though.
5,Powerful and Amazing Music,Don Francisco's music is powerful and scripturally based. The title track gave me goosebumps when I listened to it for the first time and every time since.
5,A great first step in learning to speedread,"I first found this book in 1991 and it did nothing short of change my life. It is a great first jumping in point of your quest to speedread. It is a very easy read and you will increase your reading speed just minutes into the 3rd chapter. I now read over 200 books every year and I consider this book the foundation of that ability. You will need to ""graduate"" this book and move on to another book if you want to take your reading to hyper-speed levels. I highly recommend this book."
2,Autumn Story - Landolfi's only masterpiece?,"In his shorter stories (from memory, those of Gogol's Wife and other Stories), specifically those of Words in Commotion, Landolfi encapsulates all that is bad about the Italian literary 'intelligentsia'. It appears Autumn Story, amongst the works of Landolfi, is an aberration."
5,Perfect Group Game,"My friends and I had an awesome night playing this for New Year's! I invited 7 friends over and had them each dress as their character: Mark Lester, Christopher Lester, Robert Carter, William ""Big Bill"" Bradford, Dorothy May Bradford, Eleanor Hopkins, Desiree Minter and Candice ""Candy"" Minter. I prepared a fancy dinner with my friend, Katie, and when we had finished I played the CD with the details of the murder. From there we all really started to become our characters and read our parts. All 8 of us had a great time and have our next one planned! I highly recommend this game for anyone!! ""An Evening of Murder"" comes complete with invitations, name tags, a ""sounds of the murder"" CD (which basically explains the game to everyone), a party planner (which will help you set things up), the solution and character manuals for everyone. Like I said, it's a lot of fun and you can't go wrong with ""An Evening of Murder""!!"
2,an evening of murder dies during play,"I think the game was written following a ""recipe""...insert new character name...insert particular ending...similar to a cheesy novel, only with much fewer pages. One particular item which stands out is the lack of speaking order...this makes it confusing for the participants to know when to start.for the money, there should be more detail as in a fiction book. There should be more prompting from the host so the guests know when to speak. It was also difficult to figure out whodunnit amid the confusion of the participants.I have attended professional murder mysteries and have hosted some at home and can attest to the difficulty...but...that's why i'm paying you guys, or i'd write my own."
3,Not Impressed,"The game was easy and had very simple instructions. It was nice that everything was already printed out ready to go with place cards and each suspects info. It was a semi-formal event and we made it an italian theme, with big droopy candles instead of Thanksgiving. The dvd was a cute touch. My major peeve about it was that it told you if you were the murderer right away. I think that just takes the fun out of the game right then and there, since there is no mystery for you anymore. Don't pick this game if you want a surprise."
2,"Insufficient information for characters, clumsy format","This was my first murder mystery, but I had far higher expectations than this. The CD consisted of one very useless track (sounds of the party for a few seconds, clicking of heels, champagne opening, pouring, someone choking, and instructions to start. That's it. As for the cards with information, you only get some information on your character per ""chapter"", but it's difficult to make a convincing defense without knowing everything about your character.It would make more sense to get a full explanation and bio, THEN instructions on what you must/can reveal per chapter. Also, even after we found out who was the murderer, we all had unanswered questions about the story.We had fun in spite of the game's format and poorly written characters and plot. I'll try again, but not by this brand."
5,Diego a big hit with my 6 yr old,"My 6 year old grandaughter is a HUGE Diego fan (practically adnauseum) so this would have been a good gift no matter what, but having said that, I am happy that it was such a BIG hit. The voice interaction positively delights her and it is a good solid entertaining toy. Good for bribing her to go to bed easily too."
3,Some of Nesbit's Least Likeable Kids,"Everything I've ready by E. Nesbit has been entertaining; the Psammead kids and the Railway Children are believable children and nice, even though they all get into stupid scrapes a lot. They seem to learn from their mistakes. But the Bastables, in the Treasure Seekers and Wouldbegoods, are either sickly-sweet dogooders (Dora and Daisy) or kids who just don't think, and don't seem to learn anything (the rest of them). They get into scrape after scrape - unlike Nesbit's other children who have some legitimate good times - and then the Bastables get sent to bed and that's the end of it, until they do something dumb the next day. Also, this book is purportedly penned by one of the Bastable children and so there is a lot of liberty taken with grammar, history, etc. The other Nesbit books I like are all written in third person and seem easier to read."
5,Not a bad comment.,"I love Skull Duggrey's monotonous rap flow. He is sick in the game and should be recognized for his talent, not how many albums he sells. This cd has everything a rap album is supposed to carry; with songs like ""Changes"", & ""Bout That"" there is no telling how far he would go in this rap game! Hold you head Skull."
1,Not so much............,"I just purchased this album, and I'm already about to return it. 'Bring Ya Heart' is the only bright spot on the entire album. This single attracted me but I fear I've wasted my money on this disc otherwise. It's too hardcore to really understand what they're trying to do with their music."
5,"The BEST book on single actions, bar none.","I have many, many books about guns, and this is without a doubt the BEST one that I have ever owned. The illustrations are superb, and Mr. Taffin's style of writing makes you think he is talking to you. I highly recommend this book for anyone that loves the single action revolver, but I have to warn you, it will make you want more and more guns!"
3,Good for newbies but just a recap for most enthusiasts,"Pretty good, but for gun enthusiasts like me who read a lot of gun magazines, especially Taffin's articles, there was no new material. If you've been reading Taffin's articles, there's nothing new for you here.It wasn't quite as good as ""Big Bore Handguns"" and not nearly as good as ""Big Bore Sixguns"" which had much more original information.It's pretty good eye-candy, but I'd recommend it for people who've ALREADY read the other two, above, books and are just craving for more. Even the photos weren't as good as his last two - more like leftover and staged photos.OR, ESPECIALLY...If you HAVEN'T read the above two and AREN'T familiar with Taffin's writings and are interested in single-action revolvers, then you'll benefit from this book a LOT.I hope he, someday, does a ""Double-Action Sixguns"" book. I'm sure it's just a matter of time."
3,Pretty good read,"The book is pretty good, but it doesn't tell me anything that I dont know. If I didn't know better, I'd almost think Mr. Taffin was a salesman for ""Colt firearms""."
2,Not Very Well Written,"The photos are good, but the text is uninspired and repetitive. This is part personal memoir and part informational. I'd prefer just the information, and especially dislike the fortunately brief political commentary. It's written like a series of magazine articles strung together, and not especially well written at that. Taffin says the same things over and over, some times in the same chapter.I'd especially avoid the Kindle version, unless you will read it on a PC/Mac. The photos, which are clearly the best part of the book, don't reproduce well in black and white."
2,Thought I was getting glass but it's plastic.,"This was ordered thinking I was getting a glass pendant. When I received it, it's plastic! Won't look very good on the necklace I bought it for, but it'll have to do since I already purchased."
5,best model yet,U want a real blade ? A liner lock blade? Huge saw ? Then this ones for u . Still has can and bottle opener. And tooth pick with tweezers . U will love this jet black monster
3,A bit on the heavy side,"The fit and function are perfect ... a great knife overall.I found it to be too heavy to carry in my pocket, however, and the 4 1/2 inch blade was a bit too long.I prefer the regular non-lock Camper to the Forester."
4,Annie is awesome !,This CD showcases Annie's versatile talents as a singer and songwriter !The title track is one of my all-time favorites.
1,have not been able to return/exchange,"I ordered 4 pairs of flip flops according to havainas size chart, which ended up being a size to small. This order was placed on June 10th. As of today, July 4th, I have not been able to process this return either through their web site, nor on the phone with their customer reps., who were at a loss as well. I was promised an extension for my return date (they have a 30 day return policy), and they were supposed to contact me within 48 business hours which they yet to do. Flip flops are not worth all of this trouble!!!"
1,The strap broke after minimal use,"I purchased a pair of the havaianas slim (size 37-38) and wore them for a while, but suddenly one of the straps broke off where it goes into the sole between the toes. This was absolutely not due to hard wear, so I feel that I spent over $20 for a pair of flip-flops that lasted about as long as a pair of $3 ones would have. Very disappointed, as this was my first pair of havaianas and I expected them to last for a while."
3,"Ok, but not stellar.","If you like southern, or midwestern rap, and the beats associated with that style, this is for you. It's got lots of those type of beats, and lots of cats who flow with the southern/midwestern style. There's some really hot tracks ""must be the money"", ""country grammar"", and a couple other solid tracks, but there is some filler as well. It could have used a few less tracks, and Nelly shouldn't have put so many of his boys on.I hate it when rappers use their tapes to put their boys on too, even though if I made it on, I'd probably do the same thing.It's a decent CD though, I don't want my money back for it, but I skip a bunch of tracks too."
1,Nelly... how could you listen to this?,"Nelly is possibly the worst thing hip hip could ever regurgitate, I am utterly speechless."
4,Cool CD,"I think this is one of the best CDs. The coolest track is of course Country Grammar because it sounds cool the way he raps and his voice is like that like he could be singing. If you've never heard Nelly on the radio or anywhere, you should definitely get this album."
3,okay cd,I like only about 1/2 the songs on the cd so thats why i gave it 3 stars. Definitly not as good as nllyville. i still need to get sweat and suit so i think those will be the best(i think).If u are a true nelly fan then get this.Clean or explci version dosent matter.
2,"Ha Ha!!!! Nelly ""The Elephant""",This album is too borin. nearly off of the tracks are the same. there is only 1 good track on here and that is country grammar. at least 1 good thing came outta this album. he learned from his mistakes and that nellyville is miles better.
4,Good.,"Like every one else, i heard about the death/grind/doom band ""rune"" throught the cd split they did with the band ""kalibas"" being as i never heard of neither of those bands before-- i decided to give kalibas a try first but didn't like them...In the other hand, rune was amazing blending elements of doom,grind,death and such it was a very much worth experience to being able to listing to a great band like rune. Anyways, give them a try!"
4,Two Thumbs Not Down,"They have potential to be more, even though this was a great CD. What is my basis? Why do I say this? I just saw them live. I heard 2 new songs. That is why. They last a vocalist(Doug) but the bassist(didn't talk to him) fills in deep throat(no giggling!) pretty good, and Jeremy is a great vocalist by himself. Intense, intense."
4,Excellent story,"Should be read by anyone who enjoys fiction. Enjoyable, entertaining, fun-reading, and thought-provoking. I would not put this book in the same category as the Left Behind series, as at least one review does. There are very few similarities between those books and ""Twinkling."""
2,Sealing Iron Sock,I got this sock as recommended by the maker of the iron. I used it several times on one plane but it had develpoed a hole quite quickly before the plane was even done. I ended up just getting an old sock out of the drawer and using it. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they do something to improve durability or give them away free.
5,Classic,"I've been jammin this cd since the beginning. If you dont have this cd and know it, you should. Chicken head and both the freestyle's on disc one( song 12,13) with Lil Ron just 'March' down the street with 2 15's in the back. Must have Classic!"
2,Poor quality,Arrived ripped. It is very light and moves with the wind which is pretty commone where I live. Wasn't worth my time to return it
2,"Nice to have, but flimsy!","We bought one of these for camping, and while it is pretty good sized (covers most of the surface of a picnic table)it's rather flimsy and cheaply made. I wouldn't have paid what I did, except that it qualified for the free s/h through Amazon! In any case, it's handy to have and doesn't get used everyday...so if we are gentle with it, it should last along time."
3,It's ok,"Works ok, there are gaps, of course, along the bottom but it did a better job of keeping out insects than no cover at all. No wind the days we used it or I might have given fewer stars.Kinda on the flimsy side but not bad for the price."
1,Not the product I received,The product pictured is exactly what I am looking however what I received was NOT this product. It was at least less than half the size and made out of an ugly pink lace-like material. I have had problems trying to get this company to work with me to correct this problem and will NEVER order from them again.
1,Extremely Large,"This cover will fit over ten dishes on a table. Unfortunately, it is extremely poor quality. It works like an umbrella to pop it up. It arrived with the ""umbrella"" arms all rusty. The mesh net is very thin and flimsy. It would blow off the table with the slightest bit of wind. My preference is for the individual covers. Would give it zero stars if I could"
3,Very Fragile,This food cover was an excellent size for my buffet table but it didn't last throughout the event. It tore and ripped very early into the day. It also kept flying off the food because of the breeze...should have some kind of weight on the bottom rims to keep it from flying off in the breeze! It is beautiful though just wish it was stronger and less fragile.
3,priceless meets useless,"Annoying mixture of priceless performances by the likes of the vastly under appreciated Gatemouth Brown, legendary figures like Buddy Guy, BB, Ruth Brown, The Neville Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, the oddly placed like gospel icon Mavis Staples (blues? a gospel icon sure but blues?), Natalie Cole, folk icon Odetta, rockers like Fogerty and Steven Tyler/Joe Perry. It is the pretenders Keb Mo, India Airie oddly present at every video event, David Johanson, Kidjo, and truly out of place Chuck D, that are annoying. Pity you cannot program DVDs to play sequences you want and skip those you do not (ala CD players). Saddest of all is Larry Johnson, who missed the attention it appears that he should have received back in the day, could not shake the feeling the Shemekia Copeland may come to the same fate in modern times."
4,"If you can only have one live performance DVD, This IS the one!","I don't pretend to have the knowledge of the other very good reviewers. I bought the CD for a road trip and have nearly worn it out. When I found they had made a video, I could not wait to get it! Definitely not disappointing.Every performer was on his/her ""A"" game....loved the schtick with Bill Cosby and all those fine ladies.Buy it! You'll love it!"
3,Why Was Chuck D. On This DVD,"Excellent line-up. At the end of the show all i could think was about all the great artists that could have been on the dvd, but had been left off because of the the lame CHUCK D.(C)RAP."
5,90 minutes of blues bliss,"On February 7, 2003 about fifty famous blues musicians gave a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall to celebrate 100 years of the blues. Starting with an African piece from Togo, and moving through slave and turn of the century black music, the concert functions as a sort of history of the movement. Except for a few back stage interviews, marvelous black and white archival material, and short interviews, this unadorned documentary lets the concert speak for itself. Listening to ninety minutes of the blues, I was struck by the powerful simplicity of the words, and how merely knowing the words and the music by no means adds up to the blues. Except for John Fogerty, Bonnie Raitt, Aerosmith and a couple others, all the musicians are black, which makes for a strange setting when you realize that most all the people in the audience are wealthy whites (similar to an NBA basketball game in this regard). Yes, BB King gave the final two songs. This film is a music lover's delight."
5,True blues,"Great story,history, sound and music from the musicians who carry the blues torch today. I have not reviewed anything before and you won't get a history lesson here. Watch the DVD, learn and enjoy. Well done"
3,"Good, but nothing great.","While there were some stellar performances (mostly too short though) there are too many that are mediocre. The omission of Albert King is a crime especially when they go into the 1960's and 1970's blues scene. To not cover one of his songs was a disgrace. John Fogerty, Macy Gray, Steven Tyler, and the Neville Brothers did not belong in this film. I like their music, but they are not the blues. Chuck D's ""Boom Boom"" cover was horrible.Natalie Cole was excellent and really surprised me with her version of ""St. Louis Blues"". Copeland and Cray did a splendid version of ""I Pity The Fool"". B.B. King's finale, ""Sweet Sixteen"" was excellent.Overall I'm cut right down the middle: liked 50% for 2 1/2 stars."
5,Most enjoyable evening!,"If you like the blues, this is the best time you can have and gain some important history, too."
5,New Blues Fan,"I stumbled across this DVD in the rental store and watched out of curiosity. I don't know much about Blues but I liked the heck out of this DVD! Very entertaining from a musical and educational aspect. Film clips,still pics,interviews and comments bring together blues history and the artists on stage. So I bought the DVD and the CD both! Great deal and you don't have to be a die hard fan to enjoy it."
4,Great Addition To My Blues DVD Collection,I have watched the DVD once and the picture and sound are excellent. Great performances by some of the greatest remaining blues artists. I was hoping for a little more Buddy Guy but I can't complain.
5,Urban Teacher: an Honest Book,"I used the earlier version of this book with pre-service teachers in their final university practicum. It's an honest, forthright, useful guide for beginning teachers. My students compared what they were reading with their placement experiences. I can only assume that Weiner has done an even more excellent revision, addressing the toughest issues that teachers face."
5,Great service,I received this book on time and in gteat condition! Amazon is a great source for books!
1,What a disappointment,"No, this is not Skinny Puppy, but that doesn't mean it has to be horrible!!I have been an enormous fan of Skinny Puppy et all for almost 20 years and a DJ for a few years and I can honestly say I was shocked and appalled by this album and the other Oghr album. I would not waste a penny on it (unless you want the entire collection for show). I have bought the two out of loyalty (and excitement at first) and I feel shame in saying they are terrible albums. They exhibit none of the passion, emotion, or desire I have come to love over the years through all the various bizarre roads which have been taken. I have followed and adored many a bizarre twist and have cried with the last songs, but these albums are just forgettable. What a terrible disappointment. When next I catch Mark in town, I'm going to give him a piece of my mind."
1,If you loved skinny puppy...,"If you loved skinny puppy for more than just the image don't waist your money. Welt was horrible too. I myself love skinny puppy, but considering how harsh and seemingly musicaly unskilled they are find it hard to believe many other people feel the same way about them. If you like that dank locked in an old celler feel that skinny puppy has this won't be your cup of tea. It sounds way to digital. Where's the love? Where's the analog?"
4,Excellent...Please excuse the hostility,"Seldom do we get something this delightful anymore...we meaning Industrial fans. Please note, the following cheif complaints and me debunking of said complaint1.) It isn't skinny puppy....Umm..Yeah. We know. Thats why it doesn't say Skinny Puppy on the front. Just because Ohgre is in the band does not mean it should sound like Skinny Puppy. It's it's own animal2.) Mark Walk is not cEvin Key.... See above3.) It's too ""poppy""....People expect that anything with a Skinny Puppy alumni to have that grating, harsh edge to it. This has a wee bit of that, but it's much more precisely placed. PLEASE, remember that Ohgre and Skinny Puppy are two separate entities. Judge them separately, by their own merits and flaws.All in all, the album is amazing. The bonus video fer the CD rom is a nice treat, though if ever I see it on MTV I'll die of surprise."
4,Who knew that Ogre could do pop so well?,"I was totally blown away by ohGr's SunnyPsyOp (and Welt, too)! I am a big fan of industrial music and can respect when one artist can approach it from a more accessible angle. ohGr definitely does that, they churn out many songs that are super-catchy and are still well-structured, the samples are clean and expressive. I tried out some of Pig's albums and they just seem to fall flat in some regards - albeit the great sampling Pig does - and his vocals are just grating and cliché '80s ooh-ahh-scary cheese, ohGr's production is contemporary and professional. They took into account both quality, art, and pop culture when crafting these, in my opinion, and while not pushing any new boundaries with this release, it's still a really enjoyable album."
5,My favorite ohGr release,"I noticed some negative reviews of this release and frankly I loved it. From a dj point of view both jacKo & Magic work great on the dance floor and I enjoyed the cd overall more than Welt. This cd also includes a video on it for the title track ""Magic""."
1,Not Even Close To What It Says On The Cover,"I didn't expect to become psychic instantly. In fact I didn't expect to become psychic at all. But this video doesn't even try to teach anyone how to become psychic. It's just two episodes of two different new age talk shows, both of which are boring, and neither of which instruct anyone in how to be a psychic.This is a cheap attempt to make a quick buck on two cancelled TV shows. I got ripped off. Don't buy this or anything from World Wide Multi Media, (WWMM). I want my money back."
2,Please don't waste your money,"A couple of weeks ago I received the new edition of this Irreverent guide, and I am sorry to tell you that it was a waste of money! Yes, it has pages listing restaurants, hotels, attractions etc. but with no real detail. A thin book that is also thin on information.My advice for a Disney trip - buy the Unofficial Disney guide, a much more comprehensive guide, packed with helpful advice and information."
5,Excellent Teaching Material For Those Who Have Warped Faith,"In searching for material to send to a prisoner through a prision ministry, I chanced upon this gem of a book. This book is a wonderful companion to anyone in an enviroment that destroys one's faith, and an excellent guide to the non-Christian in understanding Christian Faith. Above all it is the perfect tool for the materialistic and carnal Christian, who has been mis-guided about what faith truly is. The author was truly inspired giving us an illumination of traditional doctrine and power of Faith."
2,not good,The book was said to be in great shape but when I recieved the book the first two chapters were litterally shoved in the book and the binding was broken. The pages were out of order and the rest of the glue binding the rest of the book was cracking and prob will not make it through me reading the rest of the book.
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","Let's cover the negative stuff first. By the time I reached the last 1/4 of the book, I could care less about a cave or anybody that wanted to be in one. I don't know what editors get paid, as far as salaries nowadays, but I know this one got paid too much, for Allison definitely needed an editor. A good editor. Cavedweller had the tendency to drag on. Allison, in spots, repeated herself.That said...I still liked the book, a lot. Delia and Cissy are stand out characters. Dede is a pistol. The plot was realistic. Cavedweller also displayed Allison's wonderful sense of humor, such as the transformation of Nadine. And that wonderful line where Tacey, a young black woman tells Cissy, ""My daddy always said that white folks are simply crazy. He also said that black folks are crazy too, but we aren't simple."" *LOL* You gotta love it.This was my first time reading Allison. It won't be my last."
2,"Flat-footed prose, paper-thin characters; needs editing.","A flat, meandering, shambling book; most characters are distinguishable from one another by name alone (although, as a ""good read"" it gets better at the end). If you want good southern gothic, stick to Flannery O'Connor and Eudora Welty. If you want California angst, read Joan Didion."
1,Don't waste your time on this book,"Ugh! This book was a gift, so of course I read it. Don't waste your time! I read it a year ago and it still sticks in my head as one of the worst books I have read in quite some time."
3,"Well, at least I finished it...","I was disappointed with this book. I bought it solely on a whim after reading good reviews about it on amazon.com, and I have to say that I don't really agree with most of the reviewers. I not only COULD put it down, I had to force myself to finish it so as not to feel like I had wasted my money. I thought Cissy was an empty character, as was Amanda. Dede was the most interesting to read about, though she was fairly predictable. The mother (geez, I just finished it 3 days ago and I've already forgotten the character's NAME) could and should have been given the chance to expound on herself a little more. Too many unanswered questions whirling around her. And, I dunno, the whole cave thing just bored me. Maybe I just missed the whole point of this book."
2,"um, delia? where are you?","Have you ever been at a party and struck up a conversation with a stranger, who proceeds to tell you something intensely personal, possibly even his or her whole sad life story? The end result, of course, is that you don't know this person any better than you did before. You have learned a lot of personal details, but the individual remains a complete stranger. This is CAVEDWELLER in a nutshell. All these characters, all these details...but who are these people? For Christ's sake, make me care about them! No such luck. Still, I'm looking forward to D. Allison's next book. After all, BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA was in no way a fluke."
2,Allison disappoints in excessively-long narrative,"I must add my voice to those who were disppointed with this excessively-long novel. Never quite satisfied with exactly what ""Cavedweller"" intends to accomplish, I found myself thrilled with several chapters and utterly bored with others. English majors will have a field day with the cave symbolism, but readers who were stunned with the power and urgency of ""Bastard"" will be sorely disappointed. Characters never fully seem developed; plot wanders, and themes are forced, transparent, and, in places, unbelievable."
3,The start of something wonderful...,"I enjoyed this book and the start of some complex characters, however I anticipated stronger development and was rather disappointed in the end. Each character in the book evolved as they searched through their own pain, yet we end up not knowing if their search is fruitful or destructive. Does Amanda explore sin to the degree of hurting herself? Does Dede reconcile her maternal side with her destructive side? Does Cissy finally discover her inner strength in California? So many questions left unanswered that I feel rather cheated to have invested myself in these characters and not know the outcome.I also am disappointed in the blatent typos and mistakes...I will read Ms. Allison's next work but not with as much anticipation as I read this novel."
1,"poorly crafted, poorly realized","I was most bothered by the poor characterizations in Cavedweller. Countless times the characters turned themselves out in the most unlikely ways with no motivation or tension to explain this. I suspect Allison is ill-suited for the omniscient voice. Her incessant narrative mind-reading drove me up a tree--although this artifice was surely necessary to explain the characters' eternally bewildering behaviour. I thought the beginning was quite compelling, however, and it wasn't until I was halfway through the book before by disbelief could be suspended no more. The relatively strong caving sequences leant the second half of the book some cohesion but came too late to save the novel as a whole for this reader. The story takes place in a rural (or suburban? I couldn't tell) Georgia town called ""Cayro"". I was telling this to a friend and his immediate response was ""Like the syrup?"" which I found an inscrutably apt perception."
3,No 'Bastard',"While Cavedweller follows in the footsteps of ""Bastard out of Carolina,"" the nuances and the feeling of getting to know someone just aren't there. I've loved all of Allison's previous works, I guess this one just didn't live up to expectations. I would, however, recommend this book and any other by Allison to lovers of Toni Morrison."
3,in-between,"I felt so much more anticipation for Delia's growth than what the story offered. Actually, my hope for all the characters were left ungranted. They were interesting, but too defeated for my tastes. I guess that's real life. I did like how they stuck it out, through the mire. On the whole, it was a chore to read the book at times, and it didn't raise me from my lower self. This is my first D. Allison book --should I try bastard out of carolina?"
2,Tepid,"This was so poorly written, I found it really tiresome. The author writes from an omniscient viewpoint and gets into the head of every single character----often in the same paragraph. I found the constant head-hopping extremely distracting, and worse, distancing. Hard to feel empathy for any one of the characters when you're bombarded by so many conflicting points of view, all at the same time.The premise and the plot have merit, I only wish that the author was a better story-teller and craftsman."
2,A Mother Runs Off with a Rock Star and Leaves Her Children Behind,"This book is poorly conceived. The plot is fragmented, the writing awkward, and the characterization is superficial and contrived. Overall, it was a big disappointment.The novel is about a woman who leaves an abusive husband and her two daughters to run off with a rock star. The rock star dies and she returns to the small Georgia town she left in order to reconcile with her children.I recommend readingBastard out of Carolina: (Plume Essential Edition)by Allison instead of this. 'Bastard Out of Carolina' is a fine book that is beautifully written."
2,Disappointing,"I avoided reading Bastard Out of Carolina for a long time as I had heard how emotionally intense a book it was. When I finally read it I agreed with what I had heard, and was engrossed and engaged and impressed and touched. I looked forward to Cavedweller, expecting another beautifully written book. But I was disappointed- there were alot of sloppy errors that did not allow me to suspend disbelief (no, it is not 3 am in California when it is midnight in Georgia), characters were explored and then dropped (who was the main character?) and the story meandered with no real point that I could make out. Too bad; I agree with other reviewers that this half-baked work needed more time and an editor."
2,Not what I expected,"I really wanted to like this book but couldn't get there. Well written but poorly edited - use of wrong character name, wrong word - this is a disjointed story. There are too many undeveloped characters and subplots that don't seem to add much or go anywhere. And these are really hard, sad characters, most of whom make it to the end with some resolution for themselves but still remain sad or disillusioned. I knew nothing of this author except for her book, Bastard Out of Carolina, which was also sad, raw really, but readable. After reading her biography to try to understand her point of view I suppose I understand her characters a bit better but life doesn't have to be a recurring awful. I stayed until the end, read every word, but now I'm sorry I did. I've been depressed for days."
4,"Not another ""Bastard... "", but still worth the read","I really enjoyed ""Bastard Out of Carolina"", so I had fairly high expectations of ""Cavedweller."" I don't think it is quite up to the same level of character development as the first.The character development seemed to be very ""plot-based"". As if we were only let in on the details if it was relevant to the current storyline. In my opinion this wasn't altogether a bad thing - though sometimes it could leave you feeling like you were missing out on pieces.I enjoyed the comic twists and thought that in the end the stories were linked together, if not very tightly. Overall, an entertaining and moving story. I'd definitely recommend it. Just don't expect it to be as tight as ""Bastard Out of Carolina""."
4,Engrossing but corny.,"Dorothy Allison has been a favorite of mine for nearly a decade, so I was thrilled to read Cavedweller. I found myself hooked into the story and felt transported at times to this sleepy town in Georgia, but I couldn't completely give myself over to the story. The characters were not too far off of the outrageous creations of V.C. Andrews (!). A good summer read, but the characters and situations I encountered in Cavedweller seemed like they had been lifted from the sad pages of a Nashville honkytonk songwriter. Unfortunately, Cissy, Dehlia, and the rest will not sing on in my memory as those in Bastard out of Carolina still do."
3,This novel changes protagonists faster than Melrose Place!,"I, too, must have missed something here. While the first several chapters definitely had me hooked, I found the rest of the book slow going. Most of the characters, but especially Delia, were only partially-drawn, and each seemed to be keeping a BIG SECRET that never emerged. There is a lukewarm family drama described in retrospect toward the end of the book that could be considered expository, but it seemed like an author's afterthought, and didn't work at all.The whole cave thing was too little, too late, and the fact that it dictated the book's title surprised me. I was most frustrated with how Allison takes us deep into a character, and then pulls back, as if teasing us with detail that is ultimately inconsequential. The most fascinating characters, Rosemary and Amanda, are dangling like rag dolls at the end of the story."
2,Waaaaay Toooooo Loooooong,"Allison either needs a new editor, or she should have made this book into three different novels. I PLODDED through most of it and then gave up - mostly because I didn't care about ANY of the characters."
3,It was O.K.,Nothing special just like any other fudge that you can buy local. Not worth the money for the amount you get
5,Just like the food my Grandpa used to cook,The best Chinese cookobook bar none. Easy to follow recipes. Taste like the stuff my grandfather used to cook.
5,taurus gun grips,i got this grips 4 my taurus pt 101 they fit perfect at the gun shops they were 30.00 i pay 15.00 with shiping.
4,Not your Mama's buying guide!,"This guide is not a price list, so It won't become outdated by the time you receive it. It's more a guide to what to look for in each gemstone. I love it. It's great for understanding why this piece or that is priced as it is, it's good for helping to spot deals, & it's helpful if you're a faceting or lapidary hobbyist. My only regret is that it's so general as to where the gems originate. For example: what part of Afghanistan are the best lapis coming from? C'mon! If I win the lottery I want to go to the SOURCE to buy my stones! LOL"
5,great introduction to gemstones,"This is a great introduction for the beginner. Lots of color photographs of both cut gemstones and finished jewelry make this a beautiful book. The author goes over shape and cutting style, carat, color, clarity, cut quality and treatments. She also explains the difference between synthetic and natural stones. The last part of the book has entries for various gemstones with detailed descriptions of the qualities of each. Again with lots of photos. After reading this I do feel comfortable comparing stones and prices."
2,way to expensive for content :(,"Unless you are a complete novice to the subject, I would avoid this book. These so called 'gurus' merely give some of the ideas they have had for making procedural textures, and suggest what you could potentially do. Then they go into great detail on subjects like beveling a brick texture! Not useful. You WONT find explict texture recipes. You WONT learn how to code a texture engine (like Bryce uses for example). There is little you cant find on the web. If this book were [less expensive] I might be singing a different tune..."
3,hits and misses,"I'm using this book because I use a shading programing (shaderlab pro 2)language for truespace that is derivitive of renderman. In that sense it was helpfull becuase it filled in the gaps of the poor docs that came with shaderlab. It took me from scratch to a basic understanding of procedural coding. Oddly, the one thing it didn't include that I assumed would be there was a discussion of the worelynoise function and feature points. This was totally strange because one of the authors was worely! Even stranger was that ""advanced renderman"" did do a decent discussion of it, so now I'll have to buy that! Some people might want to check out ""advanced renderman"" because it's less intense mathematically and gives more basic insight to renderman usage."
2,Fascinating Story but Unfocused and Colorless Presentation,"1. The subject of this book is great!2. The writing style is a bit wobbly at times.3. The author jumps around and discusses way too many famous literary figures who have little or nothing to do with Mary Lamb's personal triumphs and failures.4. Very little is actually told about Mary Lamb, who is supposed to be the featured character of this story!5. The author inserts a lot of modernistic idealogy that would have been unknown to English men and women in 1795.6. Gives a quick summary of a very complex woman.7. Gives an even quicker summary of a very changing, difficult, and dramatic period of English history."
3,Slow going...,"I finally finished this book! It took me weeks. I liked it enough to keep slogging on, but I put it down more readily than I picked it up. Interesting subject matter(s). Sorry I didn't like it better!"
1,how disappointing!!!,"I am an Indian with a good command of Hindi and would like my children to be able to understand Hindi. I was so disappointed with this attempt at teaching Hindi to kids. There is hardly any audio clarity. The words are muffled and at times inaudible. I wish the songs had been sung by one person instead of in a chorus so that you could at least make out the words! The music is tedious and the less said about the video the better. There are just a few songs in the DVD, some of them Hindi translations of English rhymes. Hardly any originialty. It is a really poor attempt, at least in comparison with all the English educational DVDs out there."
4,The BEST,"I loved Chalo Hindi Bolay. Its fun, magical, and my kids could identify with the kids in the DVD. I gave a copy of the DVD to my daughters school and the kids loved it there.Songs are catchy, and the stories having meaning that kids can follow. Great DVD!"
2,"ok, flimsy, doesnt fit quite right","This product is a little flimsy and doesn't fit quite right under the sink. I think it's a little too bulky for something that is supposed to increase storage. Works ok, but is too much of a hassle to return."
4,good solution,"i really like this under sink shelf because it does solve the problem with the drain pipe. however, it needs to be a little deeper to hold more things. i had a little problem with taller bottles but all in all it served its purpose"
3,Get what you pay for,"I knew what I was buying when purchasing this product. I expected a slightly flimsy piece of over-priced plastic - and that's what I got. But for the very old and rusty kitchen sink cabinet in our rented apartment, this suits us just fine. It serves its purpose. The shelves are flimsy and waggle about because there is no brace or other support to hold the black horizontal (also plastic) pieces together. You can't place very heavy objects on an upper shelf and expect the shelf to be sturdy, especially if the sides of the unit are not flush against the side of your under-sink cabinet. It's a useful enough tool, but it's no great feat of magnificence, either in terms of design, sturdiness or quality."
1,Doesn't work with garbage disposals,"If you have a garbage disposal or a drain pipe that is even a little dissimilar to the one shown in the photo, then the product will not fit properly."
3,Under sink storage.,"The product arrived as predicted and was well packaged. However, the assembly was tricky as the parts did not fit together well and tended to slip out. After it was used for a month, the slip joints fell apart and I ended up using Gorilla glue to keep the structure together. That said, the unit fit where I needed it and the adjustable structure provided flexibility but the plastic bushings needed a better way to secure them in the metal tubes other than a pressure fit. No assembly instruction or parts list were provided."
4,Definitely Worth It,"This item was incredibly easy to put together and use and is adjustible to manuever around everything under my cabinet. It took me about 10 minutes. I love having the extra shelf. I am ordering another one, just to make the shelves deeper.A small piece was missing and they sent me a whole new one which only took a couple of days to get here, and they let me keep the other one. Great price! Great deal!"
4,useful shelf,This shelf is just what we needed. Our sink pipes are in an unusual configuration and this shelf was able to be assembled around it. We feel it was worth the money.
2,Fit the space but not very well made.,It fit well but is very flimsy . It will not hold much weight. It needs to be built better.
1,broken,"The box was open when it arrived as if it might have been a returned item. I emptied the contents to find shattered pieces of plastic all over my floor. Each plastic shelf is cracked as if from age. I was really excited to make better use of the space under my sink, but this product seems so cheaply made, I cannot rationalize ordering a replacement."
5,REALLy great and easy!,"I was a little skeptical because I thought it was too good (and cheap) to be true. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease at which I put it together and fit it. To be honest, I had to take it apart a couple of times because I didn't ""plan"" ahead but it was easy and simple. I can't believe how much more space I had under the cabinet and and much nicer it looks. Ordering more for other cabinets."
4,Good Under Sink Storage Solution,Good adjustable solution for under the sink storage to fit around pipes. I previously has a metal version but bought this plastic one for the other side when I could not find a matching one. It's just as sturdy as the metal version and it's probably better that it won't rust if the pipes leak. Use with baskets for small items.
5,Great Product,If you cabinet is a mess you will love this product. We purchased three of these. We now have plenty of extra spce below our sinks.
3,under sink storage,"product ok for the price, buut little flimsy. would like to have shelves with more variablity in width."
3,Undersink storage,"It adds a bit of extra storage to my cabinets, but the picture is deceiving. It is not very deep. Does go together easily."
3,50/50,I bought two of these. One for the bathroom and one for under the kitchen sink. The one I put in the bathroom works great. The one I put under the kitchen sink won't stay together no matter what I do. The pieces don't seem to fit together.Maybe what you have to do is buy twice as many as you really need.
3,"Poor Quality, and missed one accessory to assemble","could be useful, but you should know that its quality is POOR.I haven't left any review but for this one, I couldn't help leaving this review.it's simple to assemble, but they don't fit well!!I tried really hard to make those plastic parts to fit for each other's hole and pole.ALSO I didn't get one accessory to assemble.I thought I could've lost it while I was trying to put them together, but NO.From the first I did care not to loose any small part, and I looked everywhere of my teeny tiny kitchen.So I needed to use plastic tape to put them together!Where is 'Contact a Seller'?? I do need to contact with the seller and get that missing part!"
4,Product Works,"This worked for what I needed. My cabinets are not standard sizes so I was a bit leary on getting it. However, you can configure it to your needs."
4,Helped me organize!,"I bought this for the cabinet under my bathroom sink, which looks almost identical to the picture. It works great to put boxed items or larger things up off the bottom so that I could clearly see everything instead of having things piled on top of each other. I don't think it gave any more space but it is much more organized and things are easier to get to."
3,undersink organizer from Amazon,This product would be better for older homes with older pipe fittings.I felt like the price was too much for what you actually get.A little hard to keep together when putting into the cabinet but it does stay once installed
3,"good, but not great","This wasn't the book I thought it was going to be, don't get me wrong, It wasn't bad, just different."
2,Mainly for Mitford Fans Already,"Not as good as the other collections of Nancy Mitford's letters. The letters are edited to the point where the point of the letters is often lost and too many letters aren't included, for whatever reason, perhaps because of the shortness of the book. It is not particularly good editing to have one letter commenting on the amusing story contained in a letter from the other party when the letter with the amusing story isn't included. However, if you are already a Mitford fan, the book is still worth buying and reading."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this smock because I thought the dragon and unicorn were uber-cute. Unfortunately, the smock I got was not as pictured. The unicorn was hidden under the pocket, and all that can be seen of the dragon is the tip of its nose."
4,only day 1 but I love it,"I have had this only 1 day so far but it is better sound than the jabra I had and it really is as seemless to switch as can be with my samsung 900, even at my desk I can make calls/receive them from either the desk or cell phone without it missing a beat...This price is cheaper than the headset and stand alone (289 on Amazone too) and the HL10 H=Handset L=Lifter is an awesome product too for office productivity!!I had the CS 50 and loved it and this one does NOT have the same range but it has worked quite well and done so well over the 30 feet it says for bluetooth, atr least thats been tested a bunch with the desk unit since I done make a habit of walking away from my cell phone...PLantroinics is proud of their products witht he price, thats for sure, but this is a well designed and great working product. If I get time I will update with news after having it for a few months..."
1,Bachmann E-Z Track 18? Radius Curved Terminal,"I bought this first through ""Best Service Stores"" months ago and through ""Toysonics"" early this month (January) and BOTH turn out to be 22"" radius track and NOT 18"" radius."
3,"Not bad, but I've read better!","I've been interested in Napoleon III ever since writing a college paper about him, many years ago, so I always attempt to obtain biographies concerning him when they are published. Each book I've read tells me something new, and this one is no exception. I was disappointed, however, because the book contains several factual, and numerous typographical, errors. All in all, 1988's ""Napoleon III and His Carnival Empire"" was a better book."
4,A Pretty Good History Shorn of Boring Details,"Napoleon III has always been an enigma, both during his own time and remaining so today. This book refreshingly spares us the ho-hum political, military, and economic details of Nap III's reign and concentrates instead on the man and how events and people influenced him and made him what he was -- a rather tragic, confused, and vain little man trying to fill the shoes and name of an illustrious predecessor. The author for the most part is sympathetic to his subject and uses a variety of published material and private research to support his observations of Nap III and why he reacted to circumstances and events as he did. The author writes with a very readable style and presents a complete yet not dull life of his subject. Of particular interest are the many affairs that Nap III carried on before and after marriage and his relationship with his wife and Empress Eugenie. I would highly recommend this book as a fine overview of Nap III's life and conduct."
4,NAPOLEON III,"Say what you will about this strange little man, but he had taste and he remade Paris into what it is today. His accention to the throne of France is nothing short of incredible, but this man had amazing chuzpa and he willed it so. He had nothing in common with his illustrious, some say infamous uncle Napoleon, except a name. I liked how he loved pomp and he could really get his cult of peronality out there. He was a despot yes, but fairly enlightened, I mean compare him to the dour idiot Victoria and he was not all bad, granted England did much better under her ministers..(not her, she was shut up at Balmoral or the Isle of Wight, mourning her German stud, Albert)..ask someone what a prince albert is and you get idea of his..uh devotion to a nice pant line), but France under Napoleon III had style and it was he who ushered it in..certainly not the fool Louis Phillip who preceded him. This is good book, with a nice history lesson, that's not too painful."
4,Pumpkins Seeds Purchased and Planted - we'll see in 2008,"I purchased these 15 Dills Atlantic Giant Seeds for my 3 yr. old nephew to plant along with his giant sunflowers. We live in OK - growing region 6. 15 seeds arrived promptly and were planted in the correct sign or phase of the moon according to The Farmers Almanac. I'm expecting 15 pumpkin vines to produce at least 15 pumpkins. Hirt's will hear from me if I'm not satisfied.I gave them 4 stars for prompt delivery and careful packaging. Hirt's has a fairly negative customer review at one particular garden website - http://davesgarden.com/products/gwd/c/554/ but those comments tend to be ebay purchases.I'll reserve my opinion for ""proof is in the pumpkin"" till this fall. Hopefully I can report about large orange pumpkins with a 3 year old atop one."
4,Good seeds,"The seeds arrived fast. I started planting them indoors , I planted 10 seeds in two pots each pot had 5 seeds and in the first pot 3 seeds germinates and are growing fast in the other pot 4 germinated and are also growing fast , although I think I planted them too early I planted them in early march. I just planted another 2 pots in early April and waiting for them to germinate . These seeds are very good and can't wait until they grow bigger and huge pumpkins"
5,punkins,Ordered these late so I only planted a few of them. Every seed I planted came up and they are looking good.
2,There are better seat cushions out there!,"I bought it. It was useful for about two weeks before it deflated because of a tear or hole. I used the repair kit that came along with the Hydro Cushion (like a bicycle tube repair kit). The repair worked but ONLY for about two days then it deflated for a second time. The ""plastic"" insert for the cushion is of poor quality - NOT DURABLE at all! I would look into TOGU's seat wedge."
1,questionable and frustrating,"In the introduction, it is stated: ""no-limit cash games are seen relatively rarely these days"". Really? Why are so many of the book's examples from actual no limit games?The format is making decisions step by step playing 58 hands. Then you compare your choices against the answers.The first example hand is played without looking at your pocket cards. In the answer it is stated that you must make sure no one knows you are raising blind. Can you use this advice?Most of the answers are not explained sufficiently. Usually, when I got a ""wrong"" answer, the book answer did not help me understand.If you are learning, advoid this book; it will frustrate you."
4,very complete,"This is a very complete resource for survey research, if that's you're thing. Covers sampling, the instruments themselves, and collection and processing."
5,Great add-on to Vista Survey,This is a great ad-on for those using the Vanguard Software Vista online survey program. It helps users understand why certain question types and more so analysis are important to have. I would highly recommend this to anyone doing market research!
4,Good through book,"This book was exciting and kept me interested. It had in depth synopsis of the trial. Some of the childhood information seemed a bit far-fetched, but as a whole the book was an enjoyable read. If you enjoy true crime you will enjoy this book."
5,Excellent Album,"I highly reccomend this ablum. If you are a Hot Tuna fan you will love this album. It was the last Hot Tuna album to feature Sammy Piaza on drums. The album has a good mix of rock, blues and country music. There is also a good mix of Jorma's finger-picking guitar style along with his siering solos. There is a nice panning effect on the album that breaks up the guitar solos so different parts of the solos come out of different speakers. The album also features great songs such as I See The Light, Day To Day Out The Window Blues, Easy Now and Living Just For You. This one's a keeper."
4,Another fine Tuna,"This is an all-around good album, with a clunker or two included in the mix, but a fine album. I heartily recommend it."
3,3.5 stars,"Tuna's classic, I See The Light opens this recording with brilliance. Unfortunately,it is not sustained as this is Tuna's most inconsistent disc. This is an odd collection of blues and blues rock numbers with a couple of tunes that can only be described as dated hippyified nonsense. The production also undermines the effort with strings (with Tuna!?!?)on two tracks and steel drums on one. Still it's worth getting for I See The Light and the acoustic country blues guitar work with Cassidy's accompanying bass work on the blues material...Simon"
4,F*&%ing TUNA !- whats not to love,"IT's HOT TUNA you either know Jorma or you don't know Jack !! Could't have said it any better, why thank you, no thank you."
4,Closer To What?,"One word:Gloom.Even for said to be influence by disco kind of sound.If this is the music played by someone inspire to commit suicide, then it is scary.""This is the way step insideeeeeee"""
2,Haunted but shallow,"2 1/2Even with the momentous influence behind it, this minimalist post-punk is one of those albums that simply cannot stand up to any esteemed reputation in my ears, with hardly any of the repetitious detachment seeping into internal resonance, coming across as tautly sterile instead."
2,Silly music for Silly People,"Easily the most over-rated band ever. Terrible voice, boring music and depressing lyrics. The singer obviously realized this and offed himself. Hey, if you want to wallow in this kind of stuff be my guest but you could be spending your time listening to something great. Pathetic, Yuk! etc."
1,It deserves negative 5 stars!,"Ok, I know this is supposed to be raw or whatever but the vocals just plain suck! They're out of tune for most of the album. I can appreciate his sentiment but the vocals are simply unlistenable. The instrumentals are also loose. I can dig a ""raw"" sound but this is just a lack of talent. I love New Order but it's amazing that came out as good as they did with such crappy beginnings. Do yourself a favor; don't waste your time and money on this record!"
4,NOT AS GOOD AS UNKNOWN PLEASURES,"The first half of the album, in particular, has a few sub-par tracks. I have listened to both of Joy Division's studio albums many, many times, and I can tell you quite confidently that Closer is not the flawless masterpiece that Unknown Pleasures is.However, the last four tracks of the album, Heart and Soul, Twenty Four Hours, the Eternal, and Decades, are arguably the finest recordings Joy Division ever made."
2,Dark music for downer people,"Like slowing down on the highway to catch a glimpse of the twisted, mangled bodies being pulled from a car accident, this album might appeal to those curious to uncover the bout of depression that ultimately took lead singer Ian Curtis's life. To most others, however, this will sound like a lot of self-wallowing B.S. Pull the shades down on this one."
3,Joy Division's Worst Album,"Joy Division is one of the finest achievements of Western civilisation. You MUST buy their other albums, they are pristine timeless masterpieces. If the other albums do not change your life then you have no soul. But buy this one last. I beg to differ with other reviewers. This is their worst album. Sure, it's their swansong, with all the associated romance of that, but as Ian's girlfriend said rather pointedly during the recording of Closer: ""It sounds like Genesis"". One excellent song (Isolation), maybe 3-4 good songs, the rest pretty boring, just like Genesis. I did not like any of JD's albums on first listen, but I have never stopped listening to them at least weekly since then. ""Closer"" is the exception. People who think Closer is their best generally dislike the brilliant punk spikiness of ""Still"", and vice versa. I am in the vice versa category."
3,"Live CD is off speed, runs fast.","I love Joy Division and the 3 stars is not directed at the band, but at the production quality issue. The live CD is recorded too fast. I have had to use editing software to slow it down, why couldn't the manufacturer do this?"
5,Peerless,"In the same way that records like Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted, or My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, shaped the way I listen to music, this record caused music to refract off my eardrums far differently as soon as I stopped resisting. Closer opened my mind to everything, which is remarkable considering its stylistic simplicity. Caveat emptor: Joy Division comes off as amateurish for the uninitiated, but repeated listening reveals extraordinary song-craft."
4,Closer CD,The only thing that bothered me was that if you play the CD in your Car stereo the titles do not show as on many of my CDs. This must be due to the low quality of the copy or the fact that the copy wasn't done through licensed partner.For the rest the sound and songs are great.
5,"Fantastic Album, worth all of your pennies..","This is the better of the two Joy Division albums, though their first is an excellent album itself. This music is just so charged with the intense feelings of Ian Curtis, you can't possibly describe how heavy this album is. I won't say more. Just go and buy it. It is worth your money, it is worth your time, and if you can, go see the movie Control and enjoy Joy Division. Music this good cannot go unheard."
5,Well deserved five stars,I have this music on an old record and it's amazing. Now (after 20 years!) I purchased the CD and this music still moves my heart: what a bliss!
3,Not that great of taste.,"It's ok, nothing special.Pro'sGood Price for 850 gum balls.Con'sNot sour enough.Gum has no flavor when chewing.Will not buy again."
5,A Hard To Beat Starting Lineup Reference Work !,"An outstanding reference for Starting Lineup fans. This softbound book contains 192 pages with more than 2,000 full color sharp photos of this popular collectible. There is a one page overview of all U.S. issued Kenner sets on every American released figure. In addition to the photos and prices there is adequate text covering each topic. Major topics range from Introduction, Baseball, Basketball, Football, Hockey, to Multi-Sport; and a complete index for easy reference. Each figure is shown with the original card or box packaging. A book that you'll refer to often. Add it to your library."
4,"Different,silly,and funny","It takes awhile to get use to Sarah's comedy,but she is different.Just when you think no comic can get anymore darring,this girl sure does.Giving birth to a allien, doing a comedy show about 9/11,enjoying becoming a homeless person...etc.I think in a couple of more seasons,this show could really become something special."
3,Cheater Chopsticks,I was disappointed with this product as they are are not comfortable to eat with. However they are so inexpensive it is not a big loss. The service and delivery were great!
1,Horrible!!!!,"The book came on time, but she sent me the wrong book. I cannot use this book at all. I tried e-mailing her in order to return the book, but she never returned my e-mail. I would not recommend this user."
4,Three 10 minutes workouts for Variety Ab Work,"I've been a long time fan of Tamilee Web's for over ten years. I was completely dedicated to her 1991 Abs of Steel 2 tape, a total of 40 minutes, 2 sections for alternate days. Tamilee's Abs, Abs, Abs offers 3 different sets of abdominal work, each in increments of 10 minutes. The exercises are controlled, concise, easy to follow and definately targeted. I reccommend this video to someone who is looking for shorter spurts of abs work and desires variety. Tamilee Webb gives us both with this video."
2,ok but mirror is blinding,"I didn't want to buy the Lamaze toys because they are ugly so I got this cute dog. I attached it to our stroller and the mirror reflects the sun into my babies eyes! I had to put a sticker over it. We ended up getting a Lamaze toy, which she loves since it has more textures and colors."
4,An exciting visit to 30s New Orleans,"When I first read about the character of Wesley Farrell, I was prepared not to like him. A man that would hide his African blood didn't sit well with me. But as I got into the book and his character, I found myself drawn to this enigmatic character. What a sourpuss reviewer bernpage is. What a shame to be an avid reader and not enjoy half of what he reads. Anyway back to my review. This book has suspense, romance, and Louisiana flavor. I loved the French names associated with Louisiana's rich French history. The women were beautiful, strong, and shrewd; the men handsome, r smooth and oozing with southern charm and masculinity. Israel Digget is my kind of guy as well as Wes. I will definitely add Robert Skinner's books to my shopping cart. I'm getting ready to order Blood Red, Skin Deep!"
1,not a good excperience,"When I got my set I was really upset to find out that somebody tried to installed this set up before All the pick ups had the wires cut up really short showing an attempt to install them by splicing the previous connections not to rewire the whole thing, the middle pickup was defective... I got a new set but it took two weeks however the people from the store were OK, I only cannot understand why I got a set that was used and with a defective component, I sent an email to Amazon to report the problem no response, I had to look up the phone number of the seller, the item (S) itself was what I was looking for... not a good experience"
3,Ok book,"Has some good photos, wish it had more instruction on doing the type of detail work shown on the cover."
5,A new myth,Sara Banks is a new and imaginative writer who has created what I believe to be the first of many stories featuring the mystical character Elise. Elise has served as a muse for artist throughout the ages. We follow her through the present while we learn of her turbulent and bittersweet past. This is the birth of a new legend and I would certainly recommend this book to anyone.
3,Origins of Titanic Myths,"This reproduction of a contemporary publication is an interesting artifact that illustrates the exploitation of the Titanic disaster by the press at this time. It also demonstrates how much of the mythology about the Titanic got started. If you want to learn as much about the truth as can be learned about happened that night the transcripts of the American and British hearings are far superior as are the better organized and accurate accounts by survivors including Mr. Beesley, second cabin passenger and Col. Gracie, first cabin passenger."
5,Fascinating Reproduction!,"Great glimpse into the attitudes of the time...even the typeface, factual errors and misspellings add to the dramatic documentation of the stunned and outraged reactions to the sinking of the great RMS TITANIC. Will be especially enjoyed by TITANIC scholars and enthusiastis who now know the ""real"" story of her sinking...these personal, tragic tales will greatly enhances anyone's technical knowledge and interest in that Night to Remember!"
2,Too many inaccuracies!,"I studied Titanic all my life and I know pretty much every detail. However when I read this book I found inaccuracies that just cant be ignored. It says that there was a ""brilliant moon"" out but there was no moon. This book also gives the wrong name to the person at the wheel at the time of the disaster. As is mentioned in other reviews, its very repetitve as well. However the cover picture, inside pictures and the survivor accounts are very interesting. (but misquotes dominate)"
2,Had 1st Edition - Hardback; not totally reliable,"In this book, Dover is the Publisher; mine was the Hardback edition. It was a 50/50 coin toss for it had errors and did not meet the criteria of the true RMS Titanic while Dover did try their very best. It could have been done better ... in my humble opinion; there are others out there that exceeds far better than this one.But for those who are collecting for 100th Anniversary of RMS Titanic for their Library; it is a nice addition to the library and leaving it there with others in chronically order, however, to be frank and honest, you would find the exact same issues as I have reported. I sold this hardback edition a very long time ago, for it was not worth keeping.Try if all possible to obtain that Hardback Edition more than the Paperback (it is more valuable) if you can in Amazon!"
2,Repetitive,"I was really looking forward to reading this book but got bored within the first two chapters. It is repetitive, over and over the same thing. Don't waste your money."
1,Wrong part,"My pump is about 5 years old. This seemed to be the part I was looking for...However,it did not fit. I am out of luck."
1,Diaphram Cap,"A suction piece of my diaphram cap on my Medela Pump in Style broke off. I called the customer service hotline to see about ordering a new part. I was told that they no longer carry my part, and I would have to buy a completely new pump. Online stores are no longer allowed to carry replacement parts for my model. This refusal to let me purchase a replacement part is an outright attempt to make me spend more money to buy a new model instead of simply replacing the part. I am highly disappointed with this company."
2,call the 1-800 number before spending money,I was about to order this from here and saw a few comments about calling the 1-800 number. I called and they are sending me a free set.... no cost to me at all. Thanks!!
1,Poor,"I shipped this product to my daughter in TX and she never received the product. I have emailed the company on 3 occasions regarding this issue and the only response I am receiving is that the product was delivered on April 6, 2009. I have contacted the apartment office and the packaged was never delivered. Please assist."
3,DO NOT EXPECT TO GET IT FREE FROM MEDELA!,"So I was hopeful after reading these reviews, that if I called Medela I could get the tubing for free. I spoke with Lisa at customer service who was polite. I told her the tubing connector part came off the tube, which it did, and I need to order replacements. She took all my info, then told me it would be $10 plus the cost of s&h!! I told her that it was cheaper on amazon.com so I would just buy it there. She was stunned. I said, so, no need to process the order then. Goodbye. I can't believe some people got these for free!! GOOD LUCK!"
3,"Got tubing free, too!","Called today and Madela said I'd get free tubing, too! Thanks for the hint!! I had to have my pump in front of me to give them the info they needed-they were asking what color the lettering was in, for example."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I couldn't find this part in any store, so I was happy to see I could get it through this site. It was exactly what I needed for my second child. Delivery was very fast too."
1,I got it free too!,I also called the 1-800 number. They asked what kind of pump and sent me complimentary tubes! Thanks for the tip!
5,Got Free From Medela,"I just called, Aug 10 2010, and Medela is sending them to me for free. I just told them I accidently melted them in the microwave, which is true. I must say, thank you Amazon for leaving these posts and letting me find out about getting them for free. I may not have spent my money at Amazon today, but this is why Amazon is my go to place for almost everything I buy."
3,Called Medela about free tubing-no such luck!,"I called Medela customer service about free replacement tubing as suggested on here by several reviewers. I was told they only replace tubing for pumps bought in last 12 months! Congrats to those that were given free tubing, I guess I'm going to have to buy it for myself! :("
2,Wasn't what I needed...,Tubing did not fit my pump. Assure you are 100% aware of what kind of tubing you need before purchasing. Suggest additional info on what pump this tubing fits on disscription of product.
1,Got them for Free from Medela - plus Priority Shipping.,"After my husband melted mine in the sterlizer (take note- dont do this!) I started freaking out and looked everywhere locally to find these. All to no avail. I knew that Amazon would have them, but after reading the reviews I figured I could call and ask, no harm if they said no. After just 5 minutes on the phone, explaining to the girl my situation (she was super friendly) she said that they did in fact supply them free of charge and when did I need them by? I told her that I was due next week, and she informed me that they would be happy to send them priority mail to me so that I could have them in time. I have already recieved the confirmation code for the mailing and they are scheduled to be here in 2 days. Fantasic! Please don't waste your money - just call and ask!!"
5,FREE IF YOU ASK!!,"I took everyone's advice and called Medela's customer service. I didn't want to appear demanding so I asked for help in finding tubing for my model and that's exactly what she did. She gave me the part number and places I could purchase them. I hung up with her and called back, hoping to get a different operater. Thankfully I did and explained I heard I could receive free tubing and she said yes, took my info, and placed my order for my free/complimentary tubing! Should be here in a few days! Thanks for the advice!"
3,Ordered them FREE from Medela 1-800-435-8316,"Just like the other posters, I ordered new tubes for FREE from Medela. Thank goodness I read the reviews here because I was just about to order them and pay when I didn't need to. I also asked about ordering valves and membranes because I need those too, and they come with the tubes!!!"
3,Just ordered for FREE from Medela,"Glad I read the reviews here first! I just called Medela customer service today 4-20-2010 and they offered to send them to me free. I went through the automated system and finally got to the choice of pushing 1-to purchase Medela breastpump accessories or 2-to get info on Medela products and accessories. I chose option 2 on a hunch, after reading that some people had to pay when they called Medela. I told the nice customer service lady that I have searched all of the local stores (Target, Babies'R'Us, etc.) and still can't find the tubing (very frustrating indeed!) and she offered to send them to me free as a courtesy. She said they will go in the mail tomorrow and should be here in a few days! Maybe the difference is in which automated option you choose and which department you get shuffled to?"
4,Call Medela and get free,Call customer service at Medela and receive replacement tubing FREE through the mail. Just did so (2-15-10) and was told I'd receive my item in 2-4 days.
1,not made by medela,"the tubings were not original medela items! they are just replacement brandless items! if i only knew, i wouldn't buy this item! i would want an original medela spare parts for my breastpump!"
3,Tubes are not free at 8004358316,"not sure if i got an unhelpful customer service rep of if their policies changed, but they did not give me free tube so i bought it from them for $10+shipping+tax. they said only replace if cracked."
1,Bad description led to wrong purchase,I wish the product description specified what type of pump these tubes could be used for. I have the older Advanced Pump in Style and these tubes didn't work. I ended up getting the correct tubes from a local women's center for $8.
4,Exactly what I needed,"The tubing I ordered for my Medela Advanced Pump-In-Style was exactly as it was described - it fit my pump, was clean, and arrived in sealed plastic bags. They arrived promptly and I have no complaints at all."
3,You can get from Medela for FREE,1-800-435-8316 - I press 0 for the operator - Told them I wanted to order replacement tubing and was transferred to customer service. They verified the correct tubing for the pump I have and said they will promptly send it to me in the mail at NO COST. I received the replacedment in 3 days!
2,Don't buy this just call Medela - they'll send you some for free,You can call the 1-800 number and ask to have these mailed to you for free
1,Are you kidding me?,"Once again Amazon has disappointed me with their suppliers. These tubes arrived in seperate envelopes, the envelopes looked like they were taken out of the trash and taped together. When I opened the envelopes the tubes were shoved in and kinked. The one tube was dirty like it had been used. What gives? I am not putting these tubes anywhere near my childs food source. UGH!!!"
1,False advertisement---NOT MADE BY MEDELA,"This vendor needs to change the item description immediately. I purchased this item from them specifically because it was listed as being made by Medela. I received the item today, and it turns out it is made by Aerobile in Taiwan. They are charging $13.99 for this item under the guise that it is a brand name item, when another vendor is selling the exact same item for $9.70. The other vendor, however, is being honest and listing it as being made by Aerobile.Please do not be duped by this listing. If you don't mind generic, save yourself some money and order from the other vendor. If you want tubing made by Medela, this item is NOT it.To this vendor: Please change this listing IMMEDIATELY, as this is false advertising."
5,Medela is the best,"Against Medela's recommendations, I use a second hand pump from my sister in law. I replaced all the parts, but especially the tubing so that I could ensure good suction. The tubing is exactly what it needs to be and what it's described to be."
3,NOT FOR OLDER PUMPS,These tubes definitely do not work with older pumps...beware! It doesn't seem easy to track down the correct tubes. I'm still on the hunt.
1,Get it for much cheaper faster!!!,"If you happened to melt your tubing during sanitizing, but still have the plastic inserts and need just the tubing, save yourself money and time and head to the nearest pet store - this tubing is identical with aquarium tubing and it will cost you a whopping $2!Second, DO NOT sterilize any tubing -the material is too soft to withstand higher temps. If you look at the pump closely, you will realize that milk never touches the tubing so there no need to do more than wash with soap.All above is based on my actual personal experience."
1,Imposter,This is NOT a Medela product. It was made in Taiwan and has no certification that it it BPA free or anything. Buyer beware.
1,Beware,"These tubes are after market. They are not ""by Medela"" as they posted. Plus, who knows if they are BPA free and so on. They sorda scared me. I would never use after market parts like this on a machine that I use to get food for my baby with.I called Medela and told them that my tubes are looking funny and knew that there was a recall on some part of my pump. They then just told me that there will be some new ones sent to me, ""want is your address?"". Plus, there was no charge. If you don't have the same luck then you can buy them on their site you just have to dig around to find the online ordering. I would try customer service first."
2,ok product,this item was definitely better quality then the last set i bought for a lost pair. hope they last a lot longer and don't get lost.
4,Is it just me or...........,"Is it just my cd or does this cd not have crusin or nuthin i mean i was listin' to ""i like them guls"" and this was edited more than the one they play on the radio. is ther no explicit version of this cd?"
5,A thorough analysis.,"This the most detailed book that I have read about Torah observance in the Messianic lifestyle.Mr.McKee discusses the idea that Scripture is often divided-the OT is for the Jews and the NT is for the church. He explains why this is not Biblically correct.He does an analysis of Scripture and the greek and hebrew word meanings in context to verify that the NT does in fact validate following Torah.There are some intersting tibits about how far back in history Torah was followed. Prior to Moses and Mt. Sinai.The meaning of ""ekklesia"" is covered as well as the meaning of ""Torah"". While I thought of Torah as ""law"",that isn't what it means at all.This book is a very detailed study, and the author has obviously done a lot of research.I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Messianic lifestyle."
1,"An ""Antinomian"" response","""Antinomian"" means against law/no law. The reason the Torah/O.T.Law is no longer binding on christians today is because Christ perfectly fufliied the Law. And since christians are 'in Christ' we share His perfect life: the life that met the demands of the Law by living a sinless life, and the life that died on the cross for our sins in obediance to the Law's demand for death for all sin. The ressurected life of Christ at the right hand of the Father is our life, and that life is above all Law since it is the very life of God Himself. Now our life is the life of the Spirit and 'against such things there is no Law'(Gal.5)."
5,Better than the original myth,"I'm a big fan of greek mythology and this is my favorite story.I've read this book about 14 times and it's still my favorite.The only part I didn't like was when Psyche spent all those years trying to make Aphrodite happy and see Cupid again. She seemed to good for him.I definetely recommend this book, but you should first read the myth Eros (Cupid) and Psyche so you have a better idea of what's going on."

5,Great stool for kitchen!,"Looked everywhere all over the internet to find good solid kitchen stools. These were easy to assemble, heavy and sturdy and VERY nice looking. They look MUCH more expensive. Nice cherry finish and comfy seat. Easy swivel but not too loose."
1,Looks cheap!,"The nailhead trim ruined these stools! It is a plastic trim that is glued on. They don't look like rivets because they are taupe in color (the color of a mushroom). The trim also does not go to the edges of the cushion to the cathedral back, it stops short. Don't waste your time or money on these stools!"
2,Negative,"I absolutely love Cerrutti 1881 and use it all the time, but this scent was a disappointment, it is nothing like it's sister smell."
4,Meizu MP4 4GB Video & MP3 Player,For the price a great little video/mp3 player.Easy to use touch screen and software does a great job of converting videos. I've loaded 4 movies and dozens of songs without using up the 4GB memory. I personally do not like ear buds so I upgraded to a different style
4,Good player for the money,"This MP3 player is very good. It has excellent sound and does what it says it will do. I haven't yet figured out how to adjust playlists I have saved, even with the help of customer support, which is INCREDIBLY difficult to find how to reach them (the seller has the phone number). It also tends to stop playing after a song rather than continuing to select songs. Other than that, it's great. Small, easy to work, good sound either through the headphones or incredible sound when played through the stereo with a Y adapter from Walmart. I'd recommend it for the price."
5,Easy to use and worth the money,"I bought Meizu 4GB on sale last year. At the beginning the result wasn't very smooth. I could easily listen to my mp3s but I had trouble with videos. I had a hard time with it's manual process and once the player got stuck while playing a video (I had to drain the battery to shut it off). After upgrading the firmware that night the player started to work great (just make sure you backup your files, the firmware sets the player to it's factory settings). I have yet to have any major problems. However my only complaint would be the scroll bar pad. It seems a little fragile unlike it's brilliant screen. Compare to Ipod it can get easily worn out if it's abused.Overall I give 4.5 for the player. None the less compare to Ipod I'm more happy with Meizu."
1,Crashed and broken,"This is the worst electronic thing I have ever purchased, and the price I paid was way too much. The interface software got so messed up I was unable to get to the main menu, so I decided to completely clear the device back to factory condition. Went to their website and got the latest firmware and followed their instructions, but it is now completely out-to-lunch. Nice paper-weight. Originally, when it was working, the display was almost impossible to see outdoors, and the slide/button thing was difficult and non-intuitive. Every so often it would decide to go into ""calibrate"" mode, and tell me to push ""Play"" or ""Menu"", neither of which did anything. It takes a lot to make me mad enough to write a negative review, but this is ridiculous."
1,Junk!,"I bought this as a gift for the wife due to the positive reviews. This thing is the worst mp3 player I have ever seen. It is not user friendly at all. After a year it just died and turned into nothing more than a paper weight. If anyone is interested in an MP3 player, stick with ipods or Sony. I one is quite disappointing."
1,Please don't waste your money....,"I purchased this Meizu Mp3 Player for my daughter for Christmas 2007. First, of all the controls are difficult to navigate, (a combination of buttons and touch controls) and the instructions were of no help. Secondly, the unit worked for 3 hours and them the display went to French, scrambled then shut down after 2 1/2 hours. We thought that the battery was just low so we charged it for 5 hours but the unit refused to turn back 'ON.' We return it an bought another brand. Please don't waste you money on this item when there are better quality units for a similar price."
1,WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN,MY DAUGHTER HAS ONE OF THESE SO I BOUGHT MY SON ONE. IT LOCKED UP AFTER JUST MINUTES AFTER USING. WE RETURNED IT AND ORDERED ANOTHER ONE FROM A DIFFERENT STORE. IT DID THE SAME THING. IT IS NOT LOCKING UP BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME THING MY DAUGHTER HAS (WHICH IS STILL WORKING OK).
1,Buy another brand,I was very disappointed in this product. The user interface is awful. It's difficult to use and there are some very basic features like fast forward and volume control that are badly implemented in the design. If you listen to audio books this is not the product for you. It has a tendency to restart the book from the beginning and it's impossible to fast forward to where you left off.
4,good watch,"I am very pleased with this watch. The band was too short for my wrist. I replaced it with a maratac NATO strap, which fits the watch but just barely. The second hand doesn't index well with the face's minute/second markings, but I don't think that's really expected. Overall, it's rugged and good-looking, and the tritium illumination performs as advertised."
4,Nice,"I like these - I followed the tip of another reviewer and used these knobs go both drawers and doors - I installed em vertically for doors and horizontal for drawers and in looks great. The reason why I put 4 stars is due to the fact that I thought they might be shinier silver. They are a dull silver, which isn't bad but just to let people know. They are subtle, not fancy."
2,"Nice Design, but can't read","The cards are very nice, however, it's hard to see the numbers because the design is on both sides of the card. It would be much better to have one side white with printing on it."
4,Pretty but not practical,The cards are very good looking and well made. Our female guests found them too wide to handle well playing bridge.
3,From the back cover:,"A true innocent aboard, Alexis Lindley had boarded the cruise ship hoping to inject some excitement into her life. But she never expected to get stranded in an exotic port-of-call, in an after-hours nightclub, in the thrilling embrace of a sensual stranger! With her purse, her passport and her escort missing, she was at this mystery man's mercy.Just who was enigmatic Travis Lockwood, and why had he fled to this faraway isle? Alexis had to find out before it was too late, before she fell irreversibly beneath his tantalizing, arousing spell. Then the devasting truth tore off the blinders of innocence, and she had to act swiftly, boldly, unerringly, before her sweet dream of golden happiness shattered into pieces of gilt."
4,"Didn't like Osaka, but that's not the map's fault","If you're going to Osaka, I'd definitely recommend this, or at least some map. Kyoto and Tokyo are easy to figure out, but Osaka was a whole new trial. This map is easy to read, well labeled, and from what I experienced is pretty up-to-date."
2,light reading,"the book is composed of a series of short essays covering military events grouped by topic: failures in leadership, failures in planning, intrusion of politics into military decisions, etc. selection of the events is rather random: some are important, some are secondary. one can hadrly argue with the taxonomy of the events selected. nice one evening reading while having a glass of wine. definitely not a book for a serious history buff: the book is lacking serious analysis and details of execution. PS. there is a subtle undercurrent of contempt for the american military."
5,Big Tubba Mista CD,I purchased a CD by Big Tubba Mista and the quality was good. The service was prompt. The sales/order process was efficient.Thank you.Ed.
4,Lighter with laughter,"Film at 11 is a thoroughly entertaining read that pulses with humor and true love as the two main characters face an amusing and occasionally absurd series of events leading to their wedding day. Less noirishly-gritty than Fuller's previous work, Film at 11 is at heart, a love story with a few capers and 80's social issues layered among the amorous relations of the protagonists. All in all, a light, life-affirming story of life as it should be lived."
3,"Snappy, funny adventure story","Herb Fuller's new book 'Film at 11' is as energetic as his first one, 'It's a Wrap.' With tongue in cheek, Fuller offers a light adventurous romp with laugh-out-loud dialogue."
3,Hard Model,"This is a very hard model, It comes with no Instructions. The part list says ""Use photo as guide"", The only photo is on the side of the Box, and is 2""x1"" Here are some of the good about this model, comes with More decals then you will need, comes with people figures, and two cars, also has plasic Trees."
3,TV DVD,"I waited years for this to come out. Disappointed that half of the product is stuffed with advertising for other TV show DVD sets -- a waste of space. But at least I have the first Nash Bridges and will keep buying the follow up sets. I love this series. Will put up with the gross advertisements to get to the real thing at the next layer.Do wish it arrived in better condition though. The shipping box was too big and the product was thrashed around inside. It arrived with a crushed cover and all the internal DVD disks flopping loose. But, I tested them and they played. So I guess that's all that matters. But would appreciate more careful shipping next time."
5,Nash Bridges series,I was and still am a huge Miami Vice fan. Although Nash Bridges is very different it didn't take but about 2 episodes to get used to Don playing a different character. It is a great series and I can't wait to recieve season 2. Nash Bridges is a little more humorous and more family oriented than Miami Vice. But it is cool!
1,Nash Bridges - The First Season,"Both discs are damaged, possibly during the actual manufacturing or burning of the discs. There are large swirl-type patterns around the read faces of both discs that will not polish out with a micro fiber cloth. Therefore, parts of some of the episodes freeze up, and the discs skip to the next undamaged chapter, which is usually multiple chapters. Amazon does not replace these discs and they won't exchange the season for another title, because they are opened. I may try a buffing wheel, but I'm not sure it will help, as the marks don't appear to be scratches, but a defect in the discs themselves. I also bought Season 2 and 3 which are not damaged and play without incident."
5,Still as great as I remember,"It has been a long time waiting but was worth the wait. I honestly didn't notice that the music was not the original. My memory is not what it used to be, buy I did remember what a great and fun show this was. I have waited a long time for NB to come to DVD. Now I just have to wait for the next season to come out. Still one of the best shows ever on TV"
2,"Great show, NO FEATURED MUSIC","This was probably the release I have most waited for as of yet. A fantastic show finally out on DVD, however, the DVD does NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL MUSIC. CBS must not have secured the lisences to use ANY of the original music featured on the show. After watching the pilot episode, ""Big Me"" by the Foo Fighters and ""Please Call Home"" by the Allman Brothers have both been replaced by instrumental overdubs of different music. This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I for one am incredibly disappointed that the DVD's do not contain any of the music featured in the show. Hopefully, from now on, CBS will obtain the lisences to use the rest of the music featured in the other five seasons."
1,Worthless Travel Handbook,"I purchased this guidebook because my much trusted travel store 'highly recommended' the book. I have traveled all over the world and I have never been more frustrated, and annoyed, at a guide book than I am with this one. It has been completely worthless - from a useless and incomplete language section, to poorly edited maps (or no maps given), recommended Pousadas with no address and no phone number, to sections that go on-and-on about what to do while in a town only tell you to hunt down the local paper (which is in Portguese)to find out where to go for a ""do not miss"" experience. A three year old Lonely Planet has been far more useful and accurate than this latest edition. My question - who writes and edits for Footprint and what are they smoking?"
1,Disappointing,"Footprint makes decent guidebooks, such as Footprint Brazil, but but unfortunately, they tend to do a lot of political editorializing that makes unnececssary reading for someone seeking out a travel destination (see their blatantly Anti-Israel guide to that country for an example of this tendency) Until they change their editorial policies, socially conscious and culturally respectful consumers should spend their money elsewhere."
1,beware of this one,"First of all - the one star is because the website does not have a zero star option. This was a story so unerotic and so completely off-putting, I do not know why it was even published by Blue Moon. These erotica publishers buy entire catalogs of old ""erotic"" books from the 50s and 60s and republish them, and although the average is good, and some are very good, there are also some which are really bad. This one is really bad. There is no sex in it. There is a lot of hinted violence and non-consesual activity along with pop psy exploration of the heroine's thoughts and feelings. Very unappetising. This is not what I look for in erotica. If I wanted moralising I could get it at the church for free - I do not want to pay 8 bucks plus shipping and handling for what is essentially a bad sermon."
4,got to be careful,the magnet can harm the psp. alot of the parts are metal. if you put it near psp parts will get moved around. gotta be careful with this case.
4,A Classic Revisited,"I hadn't seen Ozzie & Harriet since I was a kid until I bought this DVD. First, the bad: video and sound quality isn't perfect; it's a little dim-looking, though nothing as bad as some old kinescopes I've seen. The good: these people are funny and as comfortable as an old shirt. No, it's not realistic, but does someone want to stand up and tell me that Seinfeld or the Friends are more realistic? That's what makes situation comedy what it is--the situations. My favorite episode was David's 17th b'day, though I enjoyed them all. The humor is mild by today's standards, the children respectful of their parents and others--definitely a step back. Unlike so many of today's comedies, these presumed the parents really were better qualified at life than their children! I thoroughly enjoyed these episodes, a steal at twice the price."
4,Christian Rock,Seraiah presents a combination of smooth Christian rock songs in this CD. The lyrics are straight from the heart and thought provoking.
4,NNGT,great gift item for the golfer that has it all and they work. Friends laughed and enjoyed the product. They will be used this following golf season.
5,"The cutest, most expressive bunny ever","My GF has not stopped talking about (or frankly, to) Rutabaga since she got it. She was excited about her iPad, but this she loves much more."
1,Unfactual,"Former San Francisco Chief of Police Sanders' book comes up short on meeting most standards of objectivity. I am personally acquainted with a number of retired San Francisco police officers who worked on the Zebra case. All recall that Sanders played, at best, a minor role in solving the case and bringing the killers to trial. Sanders' lack of objectivity and obvious attempt at self promotion render his book a less than factual read when compared to the Clark Howard book, ""Zebra"" written in the early '80s."
1,you've got to be kidding . . .,"earl ""the pearl"" prentice sanders, known primarily for being arrested, photographed and booked by his own district attorney while he was chief of the san francisco police department, and for withholding murder trial evidence, (a murder confession), from the superior court which convicted two men of homicide wrongly, and sent them to prison for over 10 years, has co-authored a book in which he takes credit for something he didn't do. what he *has done is bad enough, but to sell a book of lies to the unwitting is really, really low. you don't want to buy this piece of trash. he must be attempting to build a cushion for the pending civil case . . ."
2,"The Zebra Murders: A Season of Killing, Racial Madness, and Civil Rights",It's not worth reading since it doesn't portray the facts correctly.Any one that knows the facts of this case will find it a frustrating book to read.I didn't like it; don't waste your time on this one.B.P.
5,Nice DVD,I got this for my grandson for Christmas and he really loved watching it. He's older now but still has the DVD.
3,DISCONTINUED MODEL,"I really really loved this camera!!! Unfortunately, Fujifilm does not make the Finepix Z1's anymore, so when my zoom went defective, I couldn't exchange it. It's an awesome camera though!"
3,Match Listing,"Some reviews, like the one from All-Movie Guide are a bit misleading. They claim there's a Terry Gordy and a Matt Borne match on this dvd, but there's not. While I would have loved to have seen the Gordy match, it's still a decent dvd for what it is. Looks like most of these matches are from World Class and a few from Global, kinda hard to tell. Would be nice if there was a better description with years and federations in the dvd. Oh well.Match Listing:1. Cactus Jack vs. The Patriot2. Cactus Jack & Gary Young vs. Jeff Jarrett & Chris Adams3. Cactus Jack & Gary Young vs. Dewayne Medors & Mickey Finn Jr.4. 6 Man Tag Team Match - Brickhouse Brown, Cowboy Tony, & Wild Bill Irwin vs. Gary Young, Cactus Jack, & Iceman Parsans5. Cactus Jack vs. Doug Masters6. Cactus Jack vs. Cowboy Tony7. Cactus Jack vs. Brickhouse Brown8. Cactus Jack vs. Eric Embry - Loser Leaves Town Match"
4,"Good, but line between PxDx and ANb just got blurred","First of all, I really like this album. It is friggin heavy and fast as all get out! The lyrics are disturbing as well as the story surrounding it. However, the great thing about Pig Destroyer is that up until now they have been a totally separate entity from Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Scott Hull's other band. Terrifyer is the first album where the music sounds a bit too much like ANb, ala ""Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope"". Past efforts by PxDx have had more of a goregrind feel to them (think Mortician with a bit of punk put in the mix). That is not nearly as prevalent on Terrifyer, and I can think of at least three places in which an almost exact replica of an ANb riff is placed in this album. But, being as I am a fan of both bands, this album will still impress you with the precision with which Scott Hull and company rip through the albums 22 tracks!"
5,Long Awaited!!!,"They gave us dates and pushed it back, and now, the release is here. Pig Destroyer gives us there newest and according to me, there best work to date ""Terrifyer"". Why did this album keep getting pushed back? J.R. Hayes says they rarely put out albums, they only release an album when they feel they are 100% complete, they refuse to let any fan down. If they don't like the way something sounds they may change it at any given moment, it's just how they are ""perfectionist"". Why not take your time when you are doing something that you have put alot of time and effort into? I highly suggest any Pig Destroyer fan or Agoraphobic Nosebleed fan purchase this cd."
1,this isn't grind,apparently Hull ran out of riffs and decided to use the same one over and over again.pig destroyer are about to be consumed by mallgoths.pig destroyer haven't been even close to grind since 38 counts.and it's really awesome that the one solo on the entire album isn't even played by a member of the band.i hope they die in a van crash.
1,What is wrong with you people?,"Another nail in the coffin of civilization. Pop the top on another one, folks, sit back, and enjoy the Apocalypse."
1,Defective product design,The part of the brush that fits into the pole is too short and the prongs that are supposed to keep it in place don't stick out far enough. Result is the brush falls out of the pole within seconds of trying to use it. Should have known the $6 price was too good for a reason. No point in returning it since postage cost is equal to the product price.
1,Only lasted six months,Bought this brush in Feb 2011. Would not stay connected to pole if you pushed on it too hard which you have to do to clean the pool. Then about six months later the bristles started to fall out littering the pool. At that point I stopped using it and went to HD and bought the Pool Master Aluminum one for $14.98. Should have done that in the first place.
2,Bristles fall out,Worked okay for a few months. Then the bristles started falling out at a very high rate. This made is useless. The only redeeming quality was the low price. Don't buy. Get a higher quality brush unless you only need to use it for a very limited number of uses.
1,"wow, not what i expected at all!","I have been eating this stuff for 30+ year. This is not Li Hing Mui, maybe its white people's version. The taste and the flavor is not their. Tried one seed from both bags and threw the rest in the trash....If Li Hing Mui was part of your childhood, stay away. If not, you should be ok. Sorry, just the truth........"
3,Not really an OEM replacement battery for the AT&T 9110 cordless handset,"The Amazon description reads ""Genuine AT&T; quality accessory."" Well, it might be AT&T; quality (whatever that might mean these days), but it is not a genuine AT&T; product. What I received from eBatteries was a generic unlabeled battery pack that fit loosely in the handset; it's just a little bit smaller than the OEM battery pack. Fortunately, the contacts line up and the battery charges and powers the handset. The invoice states that the pack is a Sony BP-T23 but there is not a Sony designation on it anywhere. The invoice also states that the capacity of the battery pack is 800mAh, which is larger than the 600mAh capacity of the OEM version. My previous two batteries (both AT&T; brand) lasted about 6 years each. Only time will tell if this one lasts as long.Delivery from eBatteries took one week from the time of order. In my opinion $4.99 is a bit pricey for a 4 oz item shipped via USPS First Class mail."
1,"30 Valentines, NOT 3D Valentines","The stylized font on the box is very misleading. These are NOT 3D valentines. They are regular valentines. There are 30 valentines in the box. The stylized font makes the ""30"" look like ""3D""."
5,Great item!,"Bought this bench to help my husband out. We have a walk-in shower, which is quite large and has a permanent bench. After back surgery, my husband needed something higher and this bench fit the bill. Easy to adjust height and clean. Would recommend to anyone with a mobility problem."
3,"Good chair, but very large","I was happy to get the chair to transfer my mother in and out of the shower. I have a large shower, and an ADA 36X36 shower stall in my house. This chair is almost too large for both of them. It takes up most of the smaller 36X36 shower so be careful if you are ordering this chair. I would not recommend it for smaller shower stalls. The photo on Amazon.com makes it appear smaller than it really is."
3,The bottom fell out of mine too!,"I had the very same experience with my tool bag that Erik Nelson had with his bag! I had tools scattered all over my jobsite. I back-tracked and recovered my tools but the experience made me pretty hot. I was going to throw it away but I decided to sew up the bottom and keep using it. It works okay but the capacity was cut in half but I stil use it. I guess I'd have to give it a ""don't buy"" but I still feel like I got my money's worth of of it."
3,Average,I bought this to have my tools in. I don't have a large collection so seems like it would fit everything just fine which it does however the width and height of the bucketboss isnt very big. My hammer and electric powered screw driver sticks out about 1/3 the way. Other than that it is an okay product.
3,No mounting slots on Power Strip,"This unit has no mounting slots built into the power strip, so there is no way to mount it into a cabinet or on a flat surface. Otherwise, its a well made power strip."
3,Body by Bali,"This item helps smooth out any ""bumps"", but the bra part isn't very flattering because it flattens the girls out. It also became frayed very quickly, even when washed gently in Woolite."
4,Very Good,Product was as advertised and shown. Delivery was timely and package was received in good condition.
5,Excellent book,"Bought to read about a part if WWII history. Excellent book, great content about a specific B-24 bomber group. Much enjoyed."
1,Bosch 03320 Distributor Cap,"Bosch 03320 Distributor CapThis product does not fit ""distributorless"" Mitsubishi models contrary to the description on Amazon web site. Please verify your car model design prior to ordering."
2,A Bit Disappointed,Am a big fan of James Ray having his books and Audio CDs.Whilst the DVD was good in some parts it ended up being more of a promo for his Weekend Training Sessions and people should not buy this expecting to recieve answer.
1,"IT ISN""T PHYSICS","This movie, or what the bleep, or the secret, have nothing to do with Quantum Physics. If you think that what is spoken about in these films is real, or Physics, please get educated.These area all nothing but a ruse, it is an effort to drop esoteric terms into crackpot ideas in order to give them substance in the eyes of the uneducated. Do not let them make a fool of you."
2,Another tool to sell the Harmonic Wealth weekend....,"I LOVE James Ray and all that he teaches. I've been to his free seminars and others and I buy and study his material. I was disappointed that this DVD was another tool to sell the Harmonic Wealth weekend. There is some good stuff in it, but it's the same as all of his free seminars and then, the big sell. It was a waste of my money. I've seen it all before and was hoping to see something more."
2,if you can get past the bombast,The video back drop is almost as annoying as the listening to James A. Ray. Still if you can filter out his drab suit that is the color of the curtain .. and all the marketing for his next programs .. you can actually learn something. In particular his discussion of the observer effect of quantum physics is well done. The rest is more of a tease for a weekend workshop following which you can sign up for 7 months of support because 'clearly you can't do this alone' .. not recommended
3,Thought provoking,"A little on the harsh side compared to more recent writings, etc by James, but still useful and engaging."
4,Great dvd....Create Wealth,"This was a great dvd, and I really loved what James Arthur Ray spoke about and displayed. He is a great speaker and a great source for the improvement of life.Thank you"
2,disappointed,"Although that some of the content is exciting this video is nothing more than a sales and marketing pitch for a weekend retreat. In addition, the video production itself is poor at best. I am an avid student of quantum theory and I was disappointed with this DVD."
2,Whitecross CD High Gear,"I am a Whitecross fan who owns and loves the first four CDs by this Christian heavy metal band, but I was greatly disappointed with this fifth album ""High Gear"" and everything that came after it. The first four albums were great Christian hard rock/metal music, but the ""High Gear"" CD was a wimpy pop rock CD."
5,Find Focus and Strength,"I couldn't recommend this book more, Actor or NOT this book is a wonderful and easy way to help focus your energies, clear your mind and redirect yourself in the all too often hectic and stressfull events of everyone's day. The book itself is laid out in a fashion that makes it easy to find a reference for something specificly on your mind or the pleasure of just opening to any page and finding insight and encouragement. Keep this book close at hand because once you open it you'll want to refer to it often."
2,Discussion of homeschooling aimed solely to Christians,"This book is aimed exclusively to those interested in homeschooling for religious reasons. I am not Christian and am not thinking about homeschooling for religious reasons. I tried very hard to read it with a blind eye to the religious references, but found it virtually impossible. There are some good essays, but everything positive is interpreted in light of religious views. There are also some admonitions to organizing your kitchen to be pleasing to God, which isn't why I bought the book. A much more balanced book is David Guterson's ""Family Matters -- Why Homeschooling Makes Sense""."
1,But Not Everyone Can Write A Book About Homeschooling,"There are a lot of good books about homeschooling, full of inspiration and practical ideas. Those books cause you to do something different and better than you did it before.Unfortunately, this book did not do that for me. It was too esoteric and philosophical to be of much practical help, and it did not inspire me to do anything differently than I already do.A person exploring homeschooling would find the ideas in this book discouraging rather than encouraging. A parent would come away feeling like homeschooling would take far too much time and would be far too complicated. There is so much better out there; this book was a waste of money and time."
1,PERFECT title,"Yup.Anyone can homeschool.Doesn't matter how ignorant you are, how self-important or self-absorbed.Anybody can indoctrinate your child/children that you are better than the whole wide world, thanks be to the Christian God, and teach the children a big fat nothing.The book is actually perfect to illustrate what a terrible mistake homeschooling without regulations has turned out to be.In that sense, it deserves 5 stars.As edification, it deserves 0."
5,Works very well.,Originally bought this for a friend to use during a vacation (for the places his scooter could not go). It ended up being used by all 3 of us (different times - different reasons) before all was said & done. Rolls very well on most surfaces. Very nice chair.
5,More than I expected!,"I looked at this chair at all of the local area medical supply stores and did not find one for less that $900. The price I paid was just unbelievable ($345). My doctor wanted me to be evaluated by a specialist that ends up recommending the appropriate chair. This evaluation would have carried a total cost of about $1,000 to be paid by me and the insurance company. Since I weigh 315 pounds it really was easy to determine I needed a chair with the specifications of this one. Why cause over $1,000 in costs in order to purchase a product costing $345? I thought it was an easy decision!"
1,Chair too heavy to lift into vehicle,"This chair was advertised at 38 lbs., but is much heavier than that. One ""able-bodied"" person cannot lift it into my vehicle. It was even difficult for 2 people to lift it, so I am unable to take it anywhere. Purchased this one over two other ones that said they weighed close to 100 lbs. because I needed something light in weight. However, I would guess that this one probably weighs closer to 100 lbs as well. It is basically unusable to me if I can't take it anywhere as I don't need a wheelchair in my house. The wheelchair itself is comfortable, but it doesn't do me any good if I can't take it anywhere with me. I am in the process of trying to return it to ProChoice Medical, but they have not responded to my email or Amazon's email on my behalf."
2,He dined on shad at Five Forks,"Longacre provides the basic facts of the life of Fitzhugh Lee, who clearly benefitted from his name and relationship to his uncle Robert. His West Point career was nearly as unimpressive as those of George Pickett and George Custer. His Civil War performance, while sometimes solid, culminated in disaster. He left his post to join Pickett and Tom Rosser for a shad bake at Five Forks. While they were dining, and possibly drinking, Sheridan overran Confederate positions and doomed the Army of Northern Virginia. Worth reading to provide some useful information about this senior cavalry leader. But, one comes away less then awed by his actual record."
5,Maiden is Back!,"Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith return to Iron Maiden, enabling this band to once again take its place at the top of the NWOBHM genre. Now with three guitarists, Iron Maiden is much, much stronger than even the most hardcore fans could ever imagine. ""Brave New World"" is flawless Maiden, from its haunting opening track ""The Wicker Man"" (which is inspired by the movie of the same name) to its melodic ""Ghost of the Navigator"" to the driving beats of ""The Nomad."" With three gifted guitarists, the ""air-raid siren,"" and the ever-present throbbing beats of Harris and McBrain, Iron Maiden has no close competitors in the genre. This is where Metallica would be, had they continued down the heavy path. Get this CD and enjoy!"
5,Maiden (back where they belong),"Up the Irons, Mate, forget about *Limp biscuit *Kid rock and all the other want-to-bees. The Masters are back in town.. The more times you here this album,the more it grows on you .Blaze was fine, but Bruce back at vocals really hits the spot.. but of course there is no Maiden without Steve, banging on his Bass.. this album really kicks major BOOTY.. from the opening song till the last.. Cross your fingers and hope they will put out another 5 or 10 albums (to help us Maidenheads) LONG LIVE EDDIE........"
4,...Wow...,"WHOA!! This is a great cd. To tell you the truth, this was my first Iron Maiden cd, and it was this cd that got me into them. I couldn't believe how great the guitars and singing was. In fact, I was amazed to hear from my friend that they had better albums. Well I did go out and buy ""The Number of the Beast"" shortly after, and then a few weeks later buying ""Piece of Mind"". The bottom line is, if this could get me into old Maiden, then it obviously isn't as bad as the other new stuff."
5,Iron Maiden back with a vengeance,"Well, I just got the new album today after visiting 2 of the largest music stores in town yesterday and finding they're both out of stock! This might give you some idea of how eagerly awaited this album really is. And it was worth the wait. I have been a Maiden fan for many years and had to admitt that they seemed to lose it after 'No Prayer'. I was upset to see Bruce leave as most fans would be, but now they are back and stronger and more fired up than ever. Tracks like 'The Fallen Angel' make the hairs stand up on the back of my neck! Maiden are going all the way with this one! If your a fan you've already got it, if your not, get it! It's kick ass. UP THE IRONS!"
4,Iron Maiden can't be stopped,"Most groups change their styles after years of recording like Metallica and Megadeth going from awesome metal to Matchbox 20 in one album. But Iron Maiden has proved that they can still rock. The best songs are tracks 1,2,5 and 7. The guitar is great, the vocals still are original and they have not changed their metal style one bit. They are the band of the 21st Century! You cant go wrong with Iron Maiden."
1,"Yet ,another Metal Great disappointment","Man, this is an overrated album if the reviews here are to be believed, there best come on!I was really looking forward, when I bought this CD to be Extraordinary with Bruce & Adrian Smith back, Iron Maiden was back!! Yea finally. Three axe men, man this was going to be a guitar fest?Most of the songs are mid tempo, Boring and long without power.Guitar parts are bland at best with three axe men how can this be?Bruce's solo albums ""Accident of Birth"" and ""Chemical Wedding"" are better than this album.I never play this album although it does have about three good songs on it.I was disappointed big time with another great metal band putting out a bland album so I give only one star."
3,Spinal Tarp rules!!!,In the old days I loved Maiden as much as anyone but they should have hanged it up ten years ago. If you must reunite for old time's sake at least dump that hack Gers. Murray and Smith's playing flowed together like magic. Gers sticks around like a leech and destroys the chemistry with the worst lead guitar playing ever recorded.Some tracks are okay and bring you back to the good old days but music has evolved and changed so much since then. Maiden has not. Same old stuff. You can't go home again.
1,Chorus Overkill,"Brave New World: the upsetting first release of 21st century Maiden which follows the same pattern, track after track, and simply does not rip. As the title of this review implies, the idea was, after having played the chorus a lot, and taking the music slightly elsewhere, to come off strong with another one of those choruses and drag it to the end of the song, which is the case with 99.9% of the record, and this makes the album suffer from too much repetition, and the songs are too dependent simply on the choruses. Most songs on this release are extremely ""let's sit around in this studio for and hour or two and see what we come up with"" sort of songs. The songs worth noting are ""the Wicker Man,"" and ""Brave New World."" I'll take this over Styx's ""Brave New World,"" but come on... this was way too contrived!"
1,Awful album,"This album really sucks. Those songs are horrible. Dickinson just repeats every chorus over and over. In Wicker man, the chorus is ""your time will come""...repeated 4 times in a row, with horrible guitar in the background. Then you actually get a chorus where he says it EIGHT times in a row. ""Brave new world""? Same thing...""in a brave new world"" repeated 4 times is the chorus...and once again, for good measure you get a chorus where he repeats it EIGHT times. ""We're blood brothers""...well take a guess what the chorus consists of. Yup, were blood brothers repeated 4 times. Beyond the painful choruses , the rest of the song is bad as well. Very weak guitars, and not at all catchy or headbanging music. I mean, this album just really sucks. LIsten to the track ""The Magician"" by Dickinson or ""Wasted Years"", to hear good Maiden."
2,NOT THE MASTERPIECE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT !!!!!,"BRAVE NEW WORLD is not the masterpiece people are talking about. IRON MAIDEN released five great studio records: IRON MAIDEN, KILLERS, THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST, PIECE OF MIND and POWERSLAVE. After that, everything they released, however good it might be, was second-rate material. Their great merit was not to sell out to MTV standards, and this fact alone made their fan base to stay loyal even after the horrible albuns they released in the nineties. With BRAVE NEW WORLD, thing were considerably better, but the presence of Janick Gers still in the band assured that some of the weakest parts of the bad albuns are still in the band, i.e. - lousy guitar solos by Janick. And waht about a new ""idea"" discovered by the band, that of repeating choruses at least twelve times (in sucession !!) ??!!!"
4,"WELCOME HOME, BRUCE!","This is a joyous reunion of possibly THE greatest ever pure and true heavy metal band in history! With the now 3 guitar attack, the greatest bassist in music, and incredible drummer, MAIDEN is back to reclaim its glory. The wait has been worth it. While there are no instant classics like ICARUS or TROOPER, there is some fine music here. My personal faves are THE NOMAD and OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET-16 minutes of true Maiden! Bruce's vocals are as great as always and the whole band sounds terrific! Thanx, Maiden! UP THE IRONS! (What happened to Martin Birch?)"
3,"Okay, here I go....","I found Brave New World to be pretty mediocre Maiden. Nowbefore you start calling me names :-) I must say that I've been a Maiden fan since Killers back when I was in high school. This album sounds flat, almost as flat as No Rest for the Dying. Having three guitarists doesn't seem to help, and Bruce's vocals seem uninspired compared to their last offering Fear of the Dark back in '92. It sounds like some of Bruces solo influences have rubbed off here, but that's not what I want to here. I want good old Iron Maiden. If I want Bruce, I'll fire up a solo album. And the sad thing is, is that Bruce's brilliant solo effort The Chemical Wedding is light years ahead of what is offered here. Regarless, I still love Iron Maiden! UP THE IRONS!"
5,Maiden is back,This is an excellent piece of music. Iron Maiden keeps making great music.The guitars sound great and Nicko's drumming is excellent. This proofs Maiden can still rock for at least 12 more years. A must have for real fans.
4,Return To Form.,"After their downfall in the '90s, which wasn't bad at all but Brave New World is quite a bit better than their last 2 albums. Bruce and Adrian are back and it's how an Iron Maiden album should be. It's a solid album and a great comeback. The Blaze Bayley-era wasn't bad but this is their best since Fear Of The Dark. The Wickerman is a great opening track and the whole album's great, now I understand why it's one of their best selling albums to date. Dream Of Mirrors is another powerful song which is in my top 10 Iron Maiden songs of all time."
5,Welcome back guys!,"This album is a welcome return to form after a four album losing streak. This album never comes across as sounding stale or dated. This album has everything a Maiden fan could ask for; Galloping beats, a rythm section with a strong sense of melody, strong, structured solos, and vocals that never seem to age. I swear, along with Rob Halford and Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickenson never seems to lose his edge. The best songs on this album include ""The wicker man"", ""Ghost of the navigator"", ""Dream of mirrors"", ""The nomad"", and ""Out of the silent planet"". Personally, ""The nomad"" is my favorite song on the album, which features a catchy chorus, and a great Middle eastern type atmosphere including wonderful soloing and a plethora of great riffs. This is a very varied disc and should make Maiden fans very, very happy. Keep it up guys!"
4,Excellent,"Great music, except for one thing. It's missing the power and the fullness of the sound, even Bruce's voice is thin on most of the tracks, which isn't Iron Maiden's fault. It's the dope at the mixing board when they mastered the final CD. However, when you listen to the Rock in Rio CD, and you hear the same songs, it rocks mega time! Which is ironic, the band can set up the equipment for 1 night, and it sounds better than what the record company/recording studio could do with this CD for several days. Whomever is responsible, give them the boot. Other than it's recording issues, it's a great CDs, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Solid latter day Maiden- good album.,"This was Bruce Dickinson's reunion album with the band after an 8 year absence. It is the best album since his return. The songs are pretty catchy and the musicianship and production are epic and top-notch. If you enjoy Maiden, you should definitley pick this one up after getting all their 80's albums. Though it does not match the fire, intense melody and inspiration of their 80's classics, Iron Maiden are still putting out solid, quality work."
4,"An ambitious, but sometimes overlong epic Maiden album.","Brave New World is better than most comeback albums that bands come back with. Metal bands always say ""we're returning to our roots!"" or ""we're going to really push the envelope and go all out with this!"" Brave New World actually does a little of both. Iron Maiden shoots for a very epic sound while using the classic Maiden techniques. Some of the songs are a little slow at some points, but none are bad. These points are what brings the album down to only four stars. Maiden picked up the pace a bit in the two albums that followed though, especially in A Matter of Life and Death.All in all, this is a great album that belongs in any Iron Maiden fan's collection.Personal song picks:The Wicker ManGhost of the NavigatorThe NomadOut of the Silent Planet"
4,What Can I Say?,"This album is magnificent to say the least. The tunes get you to use your imaination and even though they are very long you want some of them to keep going forever. Top tracks include Ghost of the Navigator, Out of the Silent Planet, and The Thin Line Between Love and Hate. Other awesome hits are The Wicker Man, Blood Brothers, and The Mercenary. The reason it gets only 4 stars is the awful song Dream of Mirrors. This song seriously has issues. It makes you sick with an unbearable nine minutes of a poppish tune and a repetitive chorus. Besides this minor flaw this album is a must buy for a rock fan."
5,simply the best,"I have listened Iron Maiden albums since 1981. The first heavy metal vinyl album I bought was The Number of the Beast (I still have it). I grew up with a diet based on AC/DC, Judas Priest, Motorhead and Iron :-). That said, I almost cried listening to this album. All the epic guitars and lyrics of Powerslave, Piece of Mind, Somewhere in Time, are here. Bruce is a heavy metal hero. And my sons are wondering why his daddy has that big smile. UP THE IRONS!"
5,they've got the balls...,"...to play the loudest metal! jeez, what can i say that hasn't already been said? this album just reinforces my belief that maiden is a classic metal band that stands right beside sabbath, purple, and ufo as one of the greats! i've listened to this album about fifty times now and it's just one of those that you never get sick of. i must admit that i'd all but lost faith in maiden a few albums ago...(after powerslave) but ""brave new world"" fully restored it! buy it now or when you do you'll regret that you didn't get it sooner!"
4,Good cd!,"This cd is awesome because of Adrian Smith's sound. He's a God! But Blaze Bayley was better than Bruce, the X factors is definetly Iron Maiden's best cd. And I wanted to ask you metalheads, you know that when Adrian Smith left the Irons he started a band with Ringo's son called ""A.S.A.P."", the released 2 cd's, does any of you have ANY idea of where I can get those A.S.A.P. cd's? Please help me, I've searched everywhere! Help me! email me if you have the info, thanks..."
2,2 1/2 Stars-A few great tunes...,"Got this Tuesday. I really like ""Wicker Man"", ""Out of The Silent Planet"" and ""Dream of Mirrors"". The cd as a whole may grow on me in time, but I was hoping for something to rival Bruce Dickinson's last two solo cds, which are more Maiden than Maiden, in terms of powerchords and heaviness, these days. Instead, we have a lot of long, melodic arrangements similar in sound to the two Blaze Bayley discs, right down to Bruce actually phrasing some of the lyrics the way Blaze did. An ok effort, but just not full of heavy Smith/Dickinson tunes or Harris tunes taken from books or film..."
3,Treading Water,"Nice to have Bruce and Adrian back, but I am afraid that the songs on this CD are not up to par - with the exception of ""The Ghost Of The Navigator"". I saw them play in Munich and I found the old songs to be superior. Bruce also sang some of the songs from the first Blaze Bailey CD and I think tracks from that CD like ""The Name Of The Rose"" and ""Falling Down"" are better than anything on ""Brave New World"".The track ""Brave New World"" is almost a parody of a Maiden track. You know the what I mean - title from a famous novel, repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated phrase ( in this case ""In A Brave New World"" ( can you say ""The Clansman""? ) and then pounding dual lead guitar attack repeating riff.What I want is is for them to get back to songs of the quality of ""The Evil That Men Do"". As a big fan, I am sure they can.Oh yes, I would say that Bruce's last solo album, ""Accident Of Birth"" is also better than this Maiden effort in all departments."
2,not so fast,"reading some of these reviews you would think this album was another ""piece of mind"" or ""killers"". Every band has an album that their fans tend to overate, ""priest"" has their ""painkiller"" iron maiden has ""brave new world."" The one thing i noticed about this album is every song is long and boring. The ""wicker man"" is good, but after that it's all downhill."
2,What are these other guys talking about?,"Aside from Wickerman, this is not a good album. In fact, it's boring. We've heard all these old tricks and melodies before, only in more creative ways. The production on this album is also horrible. I almost thought it was recorded in mono. The people giving it 4 or 5 stars are probably old, tired durds desparate for Maiden (and therefore them) to relive their glory"
5,Incredible,"There's not much to be said about this cd that hasn't already been that. The line-up changes and reunition, etc.One first listen, the songs may not strike you. On my first listen I was thinking ""I hope this grows on me!"" and it did. After it growing on me, I believe this album is my favorite Iron Maiden album behind the 2 Paul Di'anno cds. It is a close one with ""Piece of Mind"", but I think I prefer BNW. The songs have some of the best melodies you can imagine. Most notably on the monster epic ""Dream of Mirrors"". Hell, all the songs have incredible melodies, riffs, tempos, time changes, etc. The production on the bass and drums is really amazing, leaving a clear, pounding, feeling. The production of the album entirely is really good. I really like this album, and listen to it quite frequently. It's not one of those-listen to once throw away albums. This is the real deal here. All you can expect from Maiden surely turning out better than you thought. This is Brave New World."
4,"Incredible, But my complaints cant go un-noticed.","I wish I could have given this album 4 and half stars but alas that was not available. I have been a long time maiden fan and this album is incredible as always, and it has many positives.1. The production is the best I have ever heard on a maiden album. Especially Nicko's Drums 2. Its more progressive, Maiden has two 9 minute songs on this album. 3. This album seems to have the best song writing since Number of the Beast. 4. The best Tracks are ""The Silent Planet"" ""The Mercanary"" ""Ghost and the Navigator"" and ""Wickerman""Here are my complaints.1. Lacking Diversity! They wont go out of Aeolian mode to save themselves. The only song in which they do switch to the Phyrigian Mode is ""Nomad"". I love Maiden, they are my favorite band, but they have beaten the 1-3-7 chord changes into the ground. 2. Lyrically it can be kind of incoherent at times.I still love the Album and Maiden has not sold out yet so UP THE IRONS to all you Maiden Heads out there!"
3,Solid Album Hurt By A Few Duds,"Bruce and Adrian rejoin after several solid Dickinson solo albums. Unfortunately, Adrian is relegated to ""Special Guest"" status, letting much of the guitar work remain in the far less capable hands of Janick Gers. There are several very strong tracks: The Wicker Man, The Fallen Angel and The Nomad. In the good category are: Ghost Of The Navigator, Brave New World, and The Mercenary. The remaining four tracks are plodding progressive efforts that nevertheless have some redeeming value.There is no doubt that this is Iron Maiden's best effort since 1988's Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. It almost erases the bad memories from the past 12 years. Sadly, the production quality is not quite up to par. The rhythm guitars are a bit muddy on the heavy parts, and Steve's signature ""up front"" bass sound is often subdued and relegated to bottom end status. There are also quite a few questionable guitar solos that bring down the overall quality of the album."
3,It's good but.......,"I don't know...I guess I was a expecting more earlier Maiden now that Bruce and Adrian came back....at least as far back as Fear of the Dark if not farther. This album sounds too much like Virtual XI (..which really wasn't that good) and X Factor. Bruce's voice is a major improvement over Blaze's but lyrically it could use a bit of work. There's places here and there that sounds..well...cheesy...I suppose Bruce's solo work is just that, his solo work, and Maiden is a separate entity, but it would have been nice to have a few heavy pieces like ones from Chemical Wedding and Accident of Birth to appear in this album too. All in all, it's a definite improvement, but don't expect Powerslave or Somewhere in Time here guys. It's still a new Maiden album. I guess I had different expectations than what alot of the reviewers here had when I heard Bruce and Adrian came back."
5,Grand CD,"This is an excellent cd and has a great amount of nice songs, this is one of my favorite cds of iron maiden"
5,They're At It Again!,"The metal gods are back with a brand new album, Brave New World. The tracks The Wicker Man, Brave New World, Out of the Silent Planet, and The Thin Line Between Love And Hate are the ones that stand out for me, yet all the songs are great. They're got a little sailor thing going on with tis album, and what can I say, it works! May many more albums come from these great gods of metal!"
4,Awesome!,"Thrilling is an understatement. It's good to have Bruce and Adrian back in the band. WOW! You just have to listen to 'The thin line between love and hate'... very unlike Maiden's earlier stuff... yet phenomenal!Other favorites on this are 'Brave New World', 'Dream of Mirrors'and 'Out of the Silent Planet'...Probably the only things that are missing are the hollowing screams and the drum rolls.Still it's a great record. No filler tracks... and all songs are quite complex!"
4,Brave new maiden,"With bruce and Adrian back in the works maiden are back, and this album is great. Not that im nockin Blaze he just didn't fit into the maiden swing of things. Favourite tracks nomad, mercenary, wicker, brave , ghosts & blood brothers worth a purchase if you are an old maiden fan and thought they lost the blot when blaze came along."
5,Best Metal CD of 2000,"For anyone looking for the revival of heavy metal, this is where it starts. Not a filler song on the whole CD. Buy this one."
5,"IRON MAIDEN IS FOREVER,AS IS HEAVY METAL!","Brave New World is beyond incredible.Its the perfect time for us to up the Irons and revelutionize the music industry again.Not only has the new millenium produced an instant classic like Brave New World.All our old school metal bands have released awesome new material.Venom,Alice Cooper,King Diamond,Type O Negative,Halford,Crimson Glory,SATANICBLACK,Cradle of Filth,W.A.S.P.And the list goes on.But Iron Maiden is the band with the ultimate following.In 1982 Piece Of Mind Turned me into a full fledge Metal head.Now in the year 2000,Brave new World has me thrilled more than ever.Heavy Metal is not just the best music, its also a way of life.IRON MAIDEN AND METAL FOREVER!"
2,Sometime sit's better not to remain then reroute,"Although that title is appropriate more to In Flames' ne album, it still a goog summarizer of what this particular album has to offer.A that would be - nothing. Just an old memory, a shadow of what was used to be one of the best, if not the best bands ever created by mankind - the difiners of heavy metal as an actual genre.They indeed changed the style: simlified melodies that gives you the feeling that this comeback was just ment you to spend your money. Nothing left from their previous charm.And it just doesn't sound the same without Dickinson.It just doesn't worth the money."
2,BRAVE OLD WOLRD...,"I love Maiden, but this is yet another cheap attempt to make money by this band. The drums are better, Dickinson is amazing as always, but as long as Janick Gers stays on board, nothing will change from the bombs ""X-FACTOR"" and ""VITURAL ELEVEN"". His solos are horrible, and there's no room for his guitar playing along Murray and Smith, one of the more charismatic guitar duo of all times (They play together since they were fifteen!) ANyway, it is better than the last albuns."
1,Maiden's dissipated new album,"Bruce Dickinson is back. That's the big news. Adrian Smith is back too. But this new cd is perhaps even worse than '98's ""Virtual XI"", with not one great song and few inspired performances. This has great potential (Maiden now has three superb guitarists) and never delivers. Buy the first album, ""Number Of The Beast"" and ""The X Factor"" if you want to hear Iron Maiden at their finest. Do not buy this."
1,one of my least favorite's of maiden,"this is probably my least favorite album from maiden, every song is long and boring. why is this album so overpraised?...it's just not very good."
1,you people must be kidding,"one of iron maidens best? are you joking, for great maiden stuff buy piece of mind or killer's, the only good maiden is 80's maiden."
1,Boring.,"Matter of life and death is much better. Brave new world is lame progressive rock NOT heavy metal. They don't even do a good job at making progressive rock either. Check out Therion, Iced Earth, or Dream Theater instead."
4,Maiden finds themselves again-sort of,"Yes, this CD has some rocking songs and is better than any album since ""seventh son"". I particularly like the Harris/Smith songs. I wish the hole album were written by them, although Murry is good too. Right away, I loved The Mercenary, The Nomad and of course Wickerman. However, the band needs to get rid of Gers! His solos are terrible, but the're not enough to ruin the album as a hole- it does grow on you. Bruce sings strong again and isn't as rough as on Fear of the Dark. Overall, the band has recaptured some of the glory days but three guitarists is a crowd!"
5,4 1/2 stars,"Maiden is my favorite metal band ever and this new c.d. makes me very happy. This is the c.d. that should have been released in 1990. I enjoy every song on this c.d. (a first since 7th Son). I like it more each time i listen to it. Nicko uses quite a bit of double bass drum beats on this album which is awesome. It is like the power metal drummers he has influenced have now influenced him. I think he is the most impressive drummer in his genre. Anyway, i love this album and look forward to listening to it many times in years to come like thier 80s albums."
5,Return Of The Beast,"Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith are back. Maiden rules again!!! BNW is not the best album forever, but it is good. Ghost Of The Navigator, Brave New World, Blood Brother, Dream Of Mirrors... Maiden, I will love you forever."
5,Great Maiden!,"The sound is what you would expect from Maiden before 7th Son. All songs are good, but there are a few that stand out to be instant Maiden classics. I would rate ""The Navigator"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blood Brothers"", ""The Mercenary"" and ""The Nomad"" as great Maiden songs. These songs easily are in the caliber of ""2 Minutes to Midnight"", ""Somewhere in Time"", ""Aces High"", ""Running Free"", ""The Trooper"", ""Run to the Hills"" to name a few. I reccomend this album to whoever enjoyed NWOBHM during the 80's."
4,Bliss,"I can't stop humming ""Brave New World."" I was fortunate enough to see Maiden that the Garden on 8/5/00, and the show was great, you MUST go see them. This album brings you back to the days of Piece and Powerslave with their rythms, and the catchy chorals. Wicker Man is a great Inro song, that just grabs you, punches you in the gut, and leaves you asking, ""Thank you sir, can I have another?"" And then they give you another, and another.UP THE IRONS!"
2,I expected better from Bruce and Adrian...,"It never seemed to me that Iron Maiden were repeating themselves until Bruce left and Blaze got in. There's not a single original riff or melody on the albums that he sang on, and when Maiden anounced that Bruce and Adrian were back, I was hoping that their creativity would come back with them. I was wrong. Altough ""Brave New World"" is way better than ""The X Factor"" and ""Virtual XI"", there is nothing new or exciting about it. The songs are just boring and lack lots of imagination. Bruce and Adrian seem to be playing only for the paycheck, and even the songs they wrote (wich are few) sound dated and uninspired. I guess that I better stick to the old albums or the Dickinson solo stuff."
2,no pebozo you yo-yo,this is way too repetitive...songs kind of sound the same...lacks in the composition department...pebozo claims this band influenced the likes of Fates Warning...b.s. pebozo; Fates was influenced by the true masters of progressive rock...Rush!
2,Bloody weak I say,I dunno what all the fuss is about this band and what have you. Sounds like every other loud mouth screaching and yelling out of tune punk rockers. Save you money. Pantera still rules the under-world.
1,NEVER LIKED THE HAIR BANDS,"I never really liked the hair bands, but iron maiden has to be the worst of the bunch.This album, much like all of their others, are just plain dull and boring. If you think 'load' from metallica is bad listen to this and you will change yor mind. At least metallica has gotten better since then. If you like britney spears and the backstreet boys, you miight like this album.Don't worry pantera or metallica, this isn't much of a threat. Hopefully ths will be the last cd released by the kings of ""cheese, pop metal"""
3,Good for your collection,"You can't go wrong with the classic line-up of Iron Maiden. Bruce, Steve, Dave, Adrian, Janick and Nicko will always impress."
4,a great undertaking,"lets keep it short..if your a iron maiden fan and love the albums number of the beast-piece of mind-power slave-somewhere in time-7th son then buy this album,it has the reminence of all these albums on one!"
5,Bruce is BACK!,"Bruce is BACK! This is classic Iron Maiden. They have come back to their old form and have created a great album. There are no weak songs on the CD. This CD has it all. Great vocals, time changes, crushing guitarwork, and awesome lyrics. If you liked the old Iron Maiden or Bruce Dickenson then this is a must have album."
4,Back to what works,"BNW is certainly not one of Iron Maiden's great albums but it's pretty good overall. Some of these songs are in their regular rotation for their live performances. In many respects, this is a classic Maiden album in sytle and song-contruction. Steve Harris knows what works and he sticks with the formula. The best part is that the band is back together as it should be, with an extra guitar player in tow.Recommended."
4,Solid album from Irons,"Hey This ia a damn good album maybe not the greatest in the band's mighty arsenal but it's right up there with some of the best , anyway The top three tunes on this one are ""Wickerman"" , ""Ghost of Navaigators"" which makes a great 1-2 punch to open the album and then ""Dream of Mirrors"" another awesome track it's long but holds you're intrest all the way through especially the chorus . In short any hard rock/metal fan should pick this up , even if you aren't that familar with Maiden ."
5,How can you rate this low?,"This album is impossible to describe in only 1,000 words. Iron Maiden is back, and this proves it.My friend said this was only alternative rock, not really metal. It's obvious he didn't actually LISTEN to the music.The lyrics are once again amazing. Brave New World is connected to the novel by the same name, if you've read it you should recognize the connection pretty quickly. But unlike most musicians today, Maiden continues to deliver with depth while still kicking ass."
3,A WORTHY EFFORT,"Not as good as their mid eighties stuff but still pretty good. It's nice to see that Maiden isn't trying to re live their 80's glory, nor are they trying to be Limp Biscuit. Tracks 1-6 are pretty good. ""Wicker Man"" the title track and ""Dream Mirrors"" are the best tracks. Out of all the 80's band that are reuniting and putting out new records. Maiden is one of the few that still making records worth listening to."
5,The best pure heavy metal album in the last 10 years,Iron Maiden is one of the best heavy metal groups ever. And they have always kept their style. This album is a sample that the heavy metal (New Wave of British Heavy Metal - like) is still alive and will live forever.
5,Brave New Maiden,"I have all of maidens' work and they are all brilliant and this album is no exeption. These guys really do know how to make exellent records it is like they have a gift like other bands i'm also into but that is not the point, the point is that if you don't have this record and your a fan of maiden then get it and you will not be dissapointed."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This!,"Considering the other reviews, I thought this would work well and be easy to use. It is anything but. It was hard to line the card up in the slot; I had to try repeatedly each time I wanted to use it; it had to go in at precisely the right angle, which was not straight in. After about a half dozen uses the thing stopped engaging the card properly, and while the unit was working in terms of the light flashing when I went to download pictures I got a ""no images to import"" message. I'm back to downloading from my camera.Given that I've had it more than 30 days, I can't even return it. I won't buy this kind of item from Amazon again; I'm going to a local camera shop where they will do a better job of standing behind their product."

4,Log Cabins and Cottages-Reviewed,"Originally published in 1920, this tiny book has numerous drawings of cabins in the Adirondack style. The first 45 pages discuss how to build log cabin furniture and simple brush camp and lean-to structures. Pages 46-47 introduce the more extensive cabins. You'll find structures measuring 12 x 16 feet to chalets that function as inns for many weary travelers. Drawings are pen and ink and show mostly exteriors. The interior drawings that are shown are interesting, showing fireplaces, stairways, furniture, and beamed ceilings. If you love adirondack style cabins/cottages this book will help to feed your imagination. If you were hoping to look at floor plans... get out your magnifying glass. Most of the floor plans are no more than 2 inches square. I still love this little book and refer back to it all the time. It would be a nice addition to your collection of log cabin books."
1,Bad Scanning,We were excited to read this book and get to know the more rustic ideas of log cabin design and construction. We had no idea that the copy we would receive is hardly legible. I understand that this book was scanned from the original 1920 work but I would think that the scanning would not have chopped the ends off most of the sentences. A huge disappointment.
3,Real World Feel,"Gives a lot of real world examples and even the exercises at the back of the chapters are very interesting.Sometimes too mathematical in terms and processes but I guess that is what the book is about.Not finished reading it yet, only at page 200 but so far I'm liking the examples that come after each chapter."
3,Informative but a little sterile.,The book is well written and informative about the events of Powell's life and the geological survey in which Powell played such a major role. My primary disappointment with the book was that I felt I didn't know the person John W. Powell much better after reading the book. The book provided very little information about Powell's life outside of his work.
4,Very remarkable,"With 'bright lights burn out', Nakashi managed to obtain a sound all their own. The fierce guitar work of both Gerald Love and a mysterious Michael C, tear and rip back and forth, while The rhythm brothers pound relentless rock and roll. Like it or not, these guys write hooks and weave inpenetetrable hooks into their music. A definite find for a fan of indie rock like myself, It is a must buy. It's too bad these guys didnt put out a full length because I would only have more great rock to spin when Im stoned at 1am and I want to blast something in my Toyota Tercela."
4,Great introduction to mindfulness practice,"I first found this book in my local library, but after finishing it knew that I had to have a copy. It's one of the most practical mindfulness/meditation courses I've ever encountered. This offers plenty of techniques for fitting meditation and daily life mindfulness into a busy schedule, while not skimming over the more intense practices. It would probably be of most use to someone using it in a group, as that would give more potential for feedback, but it's still an excellent resource for a solitary meditator."
1,Didnt hear from him and now I have two books!!!,It took forever to receive it and would not respond to emails. I ended up having to buy a new book from the book store at my school which costed me $114!!!! YES!! This seler is NOT RELIABLE!!!!
5,on time mailer!!! thank you so much ^__^,"I was very happy at how quickly the shipper had sent my product. thank you for this. and also, thank you for the reasonable prices and for not false advertising. I am enjoying my book greatly. thanks again."
2,Poor DVD Quality,"I had a hard time getting it to play. My DVD player kept kicking it out with an error message. Finally played after 5 or 6 times of trying, then when it did play, the picture quality was very bad. My DVD player plays other DVD's just fine, so it's not the player."
5,margaret,"This is very good balance ball dvd.Slowly , relax and everything not as so hard as the gaiam ball video....I like it. So peacful..."
3,good beginer yoga dvd,It was a little hard to do some of the poses and keep the ball stable. I am a beginer yoga practicer. Maybe it will get easier with muscle tone up. It will not be my first choice for a workout.
5,Relaxing,I tried this video before & had to buy it for myself! It is very relaxing. Even my 17 year old niece who has NEVER tried yoga LOVED it!
4,A must have for 2005,"hello folk if you like the devlins this cd is a continuation of The Consent it's very mellow the opening track is major,awesome this irish band is mostly unknown here in Canada but gorgeous...a buy for sure"
5,The BEST shoes for fat baby feet!,"This was my first pair of Pedipeds I have purchased and I was nervous because she didn't get fitted but they fit her perfectly! They are the only shoes she will leave on her feet and they are sooo cute. I think this is the brand I am going to stick with for her and I can't wait to buy more. The leather is soft and they are very high quality. Definitely recommended.Update: Still loving these! Buying them in 12-18 mos. now!My daughter use to throw a fit when we would try and put shoes on her. Her feet are quite chunky so I don't think shoes were comfortable for her. Not a problem with these, she actually sticks her foot out when I need to put her shoes on! They are so cute and versatile, they are adorable paired with dresses, jeans, pretty much anything. They can be pricey but you get what you pay for and these are very durable and built to last. I will now only buy Pedipeds for my little princess!"
5,good finish!,This four-book series is one my favorites. I just wish Feist had stopped after writing ADAS because the follow-up books are nowhere near as good.
4,i loved this book,"this was a wonerful book. my favorite characters were tomas, pug, and jimmy the hand."
3,"Great series, lousy end","The first three were great, no wait, they were better than great. It's the best thing I've ever read. Then came A darkness at sethanon (sigh). It has too much crazy magic in it. Don't get me wrong everybody should read this saga."
1,"Derivative, confused, just plain boring.","I bought this book from a used-book stand for one dollar. Itwas not worth the dollar -- a candy-bar would be a better use ofone's money. I liked Feist and Wurts's Empire series, but obviously Feist cannot write without help. First, the book is filled with cliches that make you cringe and hope that he is just joking, that he really does not mean to write this rip-off of Tolkien. Second, the plot is confused, badly developed, and hard to follow. The characters are walking stereotypes, I wished I could kill them all off by page 2. Feist is a rampant sexist, he obviously does not take women seriously; his female characters are even worse than the males (if that is possible). Finally, the book is just boring. On a plane, if a very bad movie is shown in a language you cannot understand, the Feist's book may provide some distraction. On a bus or train -- looking out of the window will be much more entertaining and fulfilling."
5,fantastic fantasy [no spoilers],"""A Darkness at Sethanon"" is the incredible final fourth volume in the Riftwar Saga. The events explored in the prior volume continue with Prince Arutha, Pug, and Tomas at the helm. The Enemy is seeking to destroy Arutha, Lord of the West, thereby fulfilling an ancient prophecy regarding a return to the Midkemia universe. Many surprises await the reader as old and new characters play critical roles in the fight against evil. This volume is by far the best and an incredible climax to the saga. The writing is beautiful and the story proceeds at a skilled pace. The author conveys the magic invoked brilliantly, placing the reader in the middle of the conflicts creating a definite classic. All of the battles are awe-inspiring with brilliant strategy and tactics.I had an excellent time reading the book after all these years and highly recommend the series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."
5,Review,I believe A Darkness at Sethanon is a great book. I like the fine details of the scenes and many places. I also like the way the plot is so different from many fantasy books. This is one of the best books I've read.
5,Damningly Compelling,"This is the culmination of a series of struggles and a seriesof intricate and fantastic relationships. Ray understands the mostimportant aspect of writing is not the cool tricks, wacky magic orneat monsters--although there is all that--but, rather, it isthe characterization and interaction between characters whichdevelops the story.--BilFish"
2,I did not like it,"I did not like it. That is all I need to say. I had read ""Magician"" years ago ,and I had worshipped it at the time, but after reading Robert Jordan, and Terry Brooks and countless other fantasy writers , this book was just a bore. The writer has just made a mistake common to amateurs, the good people are very brave, courageous and have great leaders, while the bad ones are just like chickens waiting to be deceived, and killed, and the only advantage they have is the numbers. I think to write more realistic he has to be objective"
4,Excellent addition to the thrilling series,This is the 4th and final book in the Riftwar series. I would have to say that it was a great ending to the the series. I really don't want to give away anything major but suffice to say you will not be sorry you picked it up. The only problem I have with this series is that there is never really any doubt that all will turn out well in the end. It would be nice to see the heroes get a few bumps along the way or to have the ending in doubt. Now having said that I will say that this is a great book as is the rest of the Riftwar series.
5,A Darkness At Sethtanon,"Tis story is an epic tale. I would highly reccomend it to any one who is into medival times and fantasy. Feist mixes the elements of fighting, romance, and magic into a tale that has effected what kind of books ive read since. It also has some of the best war scenes ive ever read. so if u like science fiction fantasy books this is youre best bet, but i do advise u to read the ones before this first."
3,If only he had written a decent ending...,"The book was action packed and good fun until the ending, which could not have been more outrageously cheap. When I read four entire books in a series, hundreds of pages of which were devoted to the shallow and uninteresting Tsurani, I feel that I am entitled to a decent ending. It would be pointless to give away what happens, so I'll just let it spoil itself on its own when you read it. Despite the cheap solution, I still actually think that the book was worth reading, and at least the book didn't end with all the heros suddenly dying for no apparent reason like in some 1970s movie."
2,Disappointing end to an otherwise great series.,It starts off great but comes to a predictable ending. I wish the author could rewrite this book. He's mixed up so many elements of fantasy and science fiction that it loses its focus.
4,a darkness at sethanon,"very entertaining read, have read four of his works to date and have really enjoyed them all.would recommend to any avid reader"
4,I hate reaching the end of this saga!,What an amazing adventure!! Feist has an incredible knack for keeping the pages turning. My only complaint is he sometimes leans towards wordiness. But who am I to say. I've read other reveiws on his works and laughed at what I considered idiotic criticism. Read and enjoy!!
4,A climatic closure to the riftwar series,"The riftwar saga has been a wonderfully entertaining series from Raymond E Feist and A Darkness At Sethanon lives up to its predecesors. The book is packed with excitment and intrigue as the tale builds to its climatic finish. Just like Magician and Silverthorn, Feist explores the greater celestial battle and explains further the fates of the Valheru and The Enemy. However while the excitment of the epic battle sequences dominates the novel the character development is alowed to become shalow. It's not quite as good as Magician and Silverthorn but is still a must read for lovers of the series."
3,Oh dear...,"This is definitely the worst book in the riftwar saga. That doesn't mean the book is particularly bad, it just left me disappointed after how good the other books were (at least they get better after this!)... I hated the corridor in the stars, and the amount of power Pug had - truly terrible. I hated that some of the more ""dodgy"" characters in the previous books were turned into heroes. But!... the writing is fluid, and there are moments of true brilliance. If you've read the other books, you KNOW you have to read this one."
3,Last in the Riftwar Saga,The last book in the much heralded Rift War saga.What works: Bringing back Pug and Tomas as main characters. These were the two principals in the first two books in the series (by far the two best books in the series). In book 3 they both faded to the background and the story suffered because of it. Kudos to Feist for bringing them back to the forefront.Feist also does a nice job of tying the storyline of the last two books to the drama of the first two novels. In book 3 it seemed like two completely different story lines.What doesn't: Feist often makes his characters so powerful that he has to get them into ridiculous scenarios to create any sense of threat or danger.Read it if: you read the rest of the Riftwar Saga. The first two books in the series (Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master) are by far the strongest in the series. But the last two books are entertaining enough to keep reading.
5,A darkness at sethanon,I have read most all of the books written by Mr. Feist and they are truly wonderful-My grandson also read them and enjoys the writing so very very much. Please keep up the good work.
3,Unrealistic for the common person,"Great story. Glad it worked for her. But not many people can sell their lifes goods, take everything they have, and move to a weight loss clinic and live there until they get skinny. It's kinda like having the Biggest Loser team at your beck and call 24-7. I am glad it worked for her and she had success, and was an interesting read - but not realistic for the common person."
1,Not what it's advertised to be!!!,"This book was suppose to be about her having Gastric Bypass Surgery and how if affected her...NOT...she talks about her life way before surgery and the last chapter or two talks about the surgery...who cares? And, I got two of the damn things...what a waste of money!"
4,cool dvd!!,I've been waiting this dvd for a long time! My girl enjoy it a lot. I just wish for it to be a little beat longer (one more episode!!)
5,LOVE YO GABBA GABBA,"My 4 year old son just LOVES YO GABBA GABBA, and I'm not ashamed to say thatI love the shows too! I've tried watching shows like Barney and Sesame Street, and found them to be either irritating or dull.. I've tried watching Wiggles and enjoyed the shows, but it was my son who was bored..This is one of the only shows where we both enjoy watching with all the cute and funny actions of the monsters and a robot and find ourselves singing together the really catchy songs..Our favorite Yo gabba gabba songs are:-""There's a party in your tummy""-""Keep trying, keep trying, don't give up""-""Settle down, settle down now""-""Peekaboo, peekaboo, I'm gonna find you""In the meantime, I am in hot pursuit of a Brobee shirt that my son is asking for: Brobee is his favorite monster.."
3,Ugh..,"My kids totally dig this crazy cracked out monster maddness of show!! To All You Parents Out There: You will be driven into insanity if you purshase this DVD. HOWEVER, Your children will sit and watch this AT LEAST once a day for a month straight!! Maybe because it's obnoxious and loud and annoying and kids like their parents to endure this obsticle a few times a day! But, whatever it is that makes kids love this movie, it actually does work if your needing a break and got things to do like laundry, dishes, ect. it's really good to have. BUT make sure not to go too far because every 5 seconds, your kids will want you watch parts of it with them.. haha"
3,"Yo Gabba Gabba, OK","I had heard great things about this show from a fellow Mom of a son my daughters age (20 months). On the recommendation, I purchased. This is a weird show! It's OK and the beginning is fun and entertaining, but there sure are some weird parts to this show. She doesn't stay interested (though maybe she is a little young yet?) and personally as I mentioned, I think it's just kind of weird!"
5,Great for young children,"Yo Gabba Gabba is my son's favorite show, and he can learn so much from it, in a fun way. These shows go over things in life that toddlers and young children really deal with, and it teaches the proper way to. It's colorful and fun, and really keeps his attention, so I can do something quick, like the dishes, or cooking dinner. Also, its actually bearable for me to watch, unlike many of the other kids shows out there today, this one is mildly entertaining to me."
5,Great dvd,This show makes my 10 month old dance! Weird looking characters but definitely a sure hits for kids. Love it Yo gabba gabba!
4,Was hoping for more episodes,"When I received the dvd I was really disappointed to find out that there are only 4 episodes on it, but I guess you can't expect much for only $12.99. Otherwise I would highly recommend this series. My daughter's only 9 months old and she's already addicted to 'Gabba Gabba', and I don't mind so much because, as wild and crazy as the show is, it's probably one of the most moral things I've seen on tv recently... ""Be nice to everyone"", ""Don't bite your friends"", ""It's more fun to share"", great stuff. I just wish they would release more episodes, and a cd of all the music from the show."
3,Awesome show; annoying DVDs,"Our kids love Yo Gabba Gabba, and frankly it's one of the few kiddie shows that I can stand to watch. We got rid of Netflix streaming so got these DVDs so we would still have the show on hand. HOWEVER, each of these DVDs are chock full of commercials for other shows - Ni Hao Kai Lan, Backyardigans, etc. Fine, they are other PBS shows, but I am trying to avoid commercials and that's part of the point of buying the DVDs. It's not a huge deal to put the DVD in and then FF to chapter 6 (when the show actually starts) but it's kind of annoying.5 stars for the show, 2 for the DVDs."
5,An adventurous book!,"If you want a book that has a lot of action and an book that will get your attention, then pick Climb or Die. This book is really good; it's one of the best you'll ever read. There's a family going on a trip, and they crash down a mountainside. The parents are hurt really badly. It's up to the kids to get help. We recommend this book to any person who loves adventure and action. --Zack Byrd, Robert Bernal and Alfredo Constantino in Ms. Marik's 6th grade class"
2,Climb or Die,Although this story did have a good story line at times it got boring to me. I liked the idea of two kids saving there parents from the cold but while they were climbing i thought it was just plain boring. The only reason i give it a two is the storyline......... the book it self wasn't that good.
4,Climb or Die,"This is a great survival story about two teens named Danielle and Jake who are traveling with their parents to their cabin high in the Colorado Rockies. On their way to the cabin, the car slides off the road and slams into a tree, badly injuring both parents. Amazingly Danielle and Jake are unharmed. The family is stranded far away from where anyone can rescue them, but Jake came up with the idea of climbing up Mount Remington to reach the manned weather station at the top. With no real climbing equipment, the two teens must find a way to reach the station atop the mountain. While they were climbing the two faced many problems but their will to survive kept the going. Finally, they reached the top and got help for their parents. This book was one of my favorite survivor stories."
4,Climb or Die,Climb or Die was an excellent survival story with amazing improvision used to reach the characterers' goal. In this book their were also real to live problems such as sibling differences. I enjoyed reading this book and recomend it for others.
3,A fun read...,I just finished the book (a perfect thing to do on a rainy Saturday) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. ?I started it last weekend and must tell you that I didn't want to put it down - a total page-turner. ?You caused me to be extra tired this week but it was so much fun. ?I also could see a movie made from this - it would be so much fun to imagine who could play who.
3,Perfect for the Afficionde of the Sordid,"I got halfway through the book and I thought, hey, it's time to say goodbye to this book, but since I shelled out some serious coin for it (a buck at Dollar Tree), I decided to see how it turned out. It isn't the page turner you might expect, but the book does make a very nice coaster for my coffee cup in the faculty lounge.Ms. Mac has a keen penchant for the seamy side of life. Sweet Fire pretty much established her as the Diva of the Dark, the Doyen of the Drugged, the Grand Poo-Bah off the Doomed. It's a tough job, but I guess somebody has to do it."
2,Not Good at All,"I'm from Charlotte, NC and I try to support the local writers. All I can say is that if you are dead-set on reading this book, buy it used. It'll never show up in the public library for sure."
5,"Many experiences, lots of feelings","As soon as I picked up this book, I felt like the authors spoke to me and for me. I identified with their crises and experiences. It made me feel like a part of a small community who has an aging parent and is going though tough times. I laughed, I cried and I read and read. At times, I said to myself, ""How did she know i was feeling that way?"" I guess we are not so alone. thanks pat, you helped me a lot."
4,I liked it,This is a very good workout however I wish the description would have included a list of items you need to get started and use throughout the workout. They were small items such as a towel and pair of weights but it would have been nice to know before I hit play on the DVD! Overall a good workout and I look forward to seeing what my results look like on day 21.
5,Great Workout,"I normally hate working out, but with Denise Austin, she makes me actually enjoy it. She is so encouraging and the workouts are too difficult. I have used several of Denise Austin's products, but this is by far my favorite. I have been using this dvd off and on for a couple of weeks and I already see the results. This is a great workout for people who believe they don't have enough time to workout. For 45 minutes, you will sweat and feel amazing!"
5,Love it!,I was skeptical at first but then pleasantly surprised when I started seeing results. This is an excellent workout for the whole body!
5,Wonderful Pilates Workout,"Denise Austin's ""SHRINK YOUR FAT ZONES PILATES"" is a wonderful pilates workout dvd.It consists of 3 workouts broken up in zones for 21 days to trim and slim.ZONE1 (15 mins);This workout is for abs & core.It works the abs from every angle and you WILL feel your muscles work.ZONE2 (15 mins);This workout is for the upper body.It works the shoulders,chest and arms.You will need Weights for this workout.ZONE3 (15 mins);This workout is for the buns and thighs.You will need a towel for this workout.Denise Austin shows that she knows her stuff in this workout,using her background exercisers to demonstrate correct technique and informs the viewer on the muscles/body parts being exercised.Don't worry if you are not very flexible,this dvd is for everyone:-)"
4,nice change,"I bought this dvd because I have been using Jillian Michaels dvds and feel I am bulking up instead of stretching out. I had Denise Austins pilates and yoga videos when my children were younger and I kept tone and the weight off. Now I feel as if I can't lose weight and I am bulky. I have always enjoyed Denise's approach, and feel Jillian is a brute with boobs. Yes, her videos shape and define, but I like a lean, tone look and feel Denise's pilates gives me that. I think you can get the benefit depending on what you put into it---tighten your muscules, push yourself more into the pose. I definitely don't think this is targeted toward a beginner, although it would be a great video to challenge you. I consider myself to be in good shape, and feel the different muscles moving with both this dvd and her yoga dvd. I am frustrated with Jillian and although see results in muscle tone, I do not see it in becoming more lean."
3,My wife likes it,"My wife likes it. I have tried it and it does seem to give a good ab workout. I'm sure that Denise Austin is a wonderful person, but she annoys the crap out of me. She is a weirdo and an airhead.... Also she is instructing the video with a group of women. Most of them are dressed as normal people would dress. One of them is dressed more skantily and she gets a lot more attention from the camera, and Austin, than the others do. Seems awkard"
2,Waste of money,"The ab portion of this workout is a joke. Let me first say that I am in good shape. Working out for years. Yoga for 5 years. Pilates on and off for 2 years. Maybe I need something way more advanced. The leg and arm potion of this is pretty ok. The ab section is a JOKE. Way too easy. Even a beginner would laugh at the ab section. If she performed more reps than this would be much better, maybe even effective. In fact I actually like the ab exercises, but she does like 5 reps so you feel nothing. Also she does not give any direction so ....you may want to view it first or be familar with pilates before you begin. If you want a good ab workout do anything by Cindy Whitmarsh. She is the best trainer I have seen so far."
1,Too Easy,"I used this workout twice and it was too easy. I did not feel like I was getting a workout. I thought Denise Austine was too perky, fake, and annoying. I gave the DVD away. I bought two of the 10 minutes solution workouts and I really like them."
3,"cheesy, but I like the dolphins","This book is cheesy in execution. Especially toward the end. I agree with a lot of the negative comments I'm reading here.However, I really like the idea of talking dolphins. After reading this book, I am ready to sign on to that project. I don't think it will be impossible to bridge the gap separating us from our fellow large mammals.We're going to need friends out there."
1,overrated,"And this is the book some have reviewed as ""the best space opera""? A book where nothing interesting happens, with uninteresting characters, and best of all, a resolution that is supposedly galaxy shattering but we cannot explain why because human language cannot convey its importance (this is actually in the book folks).I gave the series a chance with 'Sundiver' and found it below average. I gave it a second chance with 'Startide' and it was mediocre. I am done wasting my time."
5,David Brin gives you high adventure and a good time.,"It's always a pleasure to find a new author who writes well. Startide Rising will take you into galaxy of intrigue and danger. A place where humans are considered backward and in need of a protector species to uplift them into galactic society. A lot of species think 100,000 years of servitude would have been a fair price to uplift the humans. But the human aren't cooperating. They have uplifted themselves (very rare) and uplifted two other species besides (unheard of). Get ready for an exciting ride"
5,One of the best from the visionary Brin,"David Brin is one of my favorite writers because his originality and world-building skills are sublime. Here is a classic space opera turned on its side and upside down! Just a glimpse into Brin's Uplift Universe: poetic dolphins that run starships, chimps smarter than most people, aliens so odd and with such different ethos that we could never hope to understand, and secrets older than our solar system that some don't want humans to know. Startide Rising is mainly a story about young upstarts crashing the galactic party who live to tell the tale. And what a galaxy it is!! No Fermi Paradox here!!"
5,A Must Read Sci-Fi Classic!!!!,"Since reading Startide Rising, I have not only read everything else Brin has written, but I have bought the paperback MANY time to give to friends with MUST READ instructions. This is absolutely one of the best real Sci-Fi books written in the last 20 years and I am an avid reader of almost exclusively science fiction.Brin's development of a galactic culture based on the raising up of pre sentient beings to sentience and the following term of indenture to the Patron race is great! It's even better because the reader can identify with the ""Wolfing"" human race as they buck time rusted and rigid galactic society.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The only thing I have seen lately on a par is ""Ender's Game"" and before that ""Dune"".Enjoy."
2,Reading this book was painful,"I thought that Ender's Game was a 10 and this book was a 3. I read it because it also won the Hugo and Nebula awards. It is over 400 pages and the first two or three hundred are boring. Brin opens a number of threads but in those 400+ pages, he only manages to resolve one or two of them. The revelation about the agressive dolphin was good but other than that, the rest of the book felt like a waste of time. Very disappointing after reading all the glowing ""10"" reviews."
2,"If this is the best, then you haven't read much.","I'll admit, David Brin is a talented writer, but this book is far from genius. He writes about a thousand different storylines, and then ends every single one with a perfectly happy ending. I won't give away the book, but trust me, everything works out perfectly. It's cheesier than a Brady Bunch episode. The ending was an incredible LETDOWN. Aside from being shallow, the science behind the book was bad. Any linguist will tell you that the explanations about communication were weak. You can't make the dolphin species talk, and then not explain it. This book really has some low points."
1,"Silly, Dolphin Rubbish","Yuk.In this series, the author includes dolphins as some of the main characters.They wear harnesses with various contraptions attached in order to interact with their environment and they have been genetically improved so they can communicate with their human shipmates.If you can swallow that you may like this series. I couldn't and returned the books"
1,disappointing,"There are some intriguing questions at the beggining of the book, but they aren't solved. You have to read 4 more books for that (I won't). The style is annoying, the aliens ridiculous. I cannot recommend this!"
3,Interesting Read - if a bit dated and contrived,"Starting out, I was a little afraid that the SciFi portion of this book would be overstated as crewmen were faxing reports to each other. That on top of a contrived setting where the dolphin crew happen to crash on a water world perfect for dolphins. Then, throw in a bit of weird dolphin rituals like playing tummy sticks for dominance and talking about dolphin penial sheaths... needless to say, I was pretty worried about this Hugo and Nebula winner. As things turned out, glad to have read this one novel from Brin. It did have some interesting concepts and did paint the canvas for a much larger tableau. However, I thought that it could have covered a lot more ground and leveraged the galatic implications of the crew's discovery. Basically, you are looking at swimming with dolphins in 90% of this book."
2,Interesting concept but not my cup of tea,I bought this book on impulse and because it has generally good reviews but I had to put it down after only getting about a quarter of the way through. It's probably more a reflection of my sci-fi taste than the book itself. Dolphins in space just doesn't work for me.
1,Overated,"The story may be considered strong, but there is one truly annoying element: most of the characters are DOLPHINS. DOLPHINS speak English, travel in and command starships, and seem to be superior to humans. This is the kind of novel that influences many to pass off sci-fi as a joke. I couldn't make it through 50 pages before I stopped in disgust. The fact that the novel won the hugo and nebula is rediculous."
4,"Superior Sci-Fi, not for everyone though","I loved this book, it is hard sci-fi at its best. David Brin writes a very technical novel which is a turn off for some people, including a few friends of mine who don't warm up well to hard, ""scientific"" sci-fi books.Another turn off for some people was the lack of characterization. Some of it was a little weak and characters don't act exactly how I would predict in the emergency situations that they find themselves in.The rest of the book shines making it a classic novel in the genre. The ideas are on a cosmic scale with God like aliens, galactic civilizations, libraries that hold the sum of all knowledge and the key idea of uplifting a primitive species to full sentience.I think of David Brin as a newer and more polished Arthur C. Clarke. As literature, Brin isn't quite in the upper echelon of sci-fi (try some early Orson Scott Card and early Dan Simmons) but with ideas, Brin is the very best."
4,The epitome of Klaus Dinger!,"Viva is the second studio album from Klaus Dinger's La Dusseldorf. Klaus was the second half of the motorik based German band Neu! and this album is similar to the album Neu! 75. With Viva, some of the songs still are driven by the trademark motorik beat of Dinger, such as Rheinita and Geld. It seems that the subject of this album is Dinger himself. We get to learn about his fashion sense in White Overalls, his disdain for money in Geld, and his hopes for the future with Cha Cha 2000. Even the title of the instrumental track Rheinita is a reference to Dinger and a girl (Anita) being separated when he was younger. So what's the music like? Driven by the drums and layered with somtimes multiple guitars and synths, the music has a full somtimes majestic sound. White Overalls and Geld even have a punk feel to them. Cha Cha 2000 does drag on a bit (the track is 20 minutes), otherwise a very enjoyable album if you are into Krautrock."
3,A typical romance novel turned tv movie of the week,"Yes, it's a ROMANCE movie which means that there are no guns, no bombs, no terrorist attacks, no fighter jets, no cool car chases(although there is a nasty car accident, there probably isn't enough blood shed for die hard action fans) and, THANK GOD, no gratuitous sex or nudity. It is a bit sappy and pretty predictable, but for the person who enjoys reading romance novels, especially by Danielle Steele, I think you'll enjoy this adaptation of her first best seller. Great performances by Stephen Collins and Kathleen Quinlan"
5,A True Soul-Mate Tale!,"Picture it...undying love. Soul-mates that made a promise to never say goodbye, fall victim to an accident, and the misguided attempts of a mother protecting her family's business.Anyone who has seen and understood the intense bond of couples in films like ""Somewhere in Time"", or ""What Dreams May Come"" will be moved by the resilient love of Michael and Nancy. The plot could be considered ""Soap Opera"", but with the great cast, music, and pacing, it is a gem! I am glad to finally own a copy of this movie again! Grab the box of tissues!"
5,I Finally Can Own IT :)!,"This was one of my favorite movies. I saw it on TV, and then years later saw it at the video store and rented it numerous times. The store closed, and no one could find it for me. Finally, tonight, I bought it. I will watch it again and again. It is a timeless classic love story that haunts. What a prize! I recommend it to everyone who either has had a deep, bonding love, or dares to dream of a love that surpasses time and understanding."
5,The Promise,I saw the movie - I want the video but I don't know how to get it. Please help me to purchase this on line. PLEASE PLEASE HELPIt is absolutely the best book I have ever read and ultimately the best show I have ever seen.
1,Nothing like the book,This movie was horrible! It had none of the passion that the book held. After reading the book I couldn't wait to see this movie and was very disappointed. They really should do a remake of this movie since this one stunk!
2,Rather flat story (though the book was surprisingly clever),My above summary pretty much explains all my feelings toward this preposterous movie...
3,The Promise is right on,"This movie was right on it promised to be a good movie it was. I took away to stars because I don't even know who Kathleen Quinn is and I didn't think she was that good anyway. You place her with a great actor like Stephen Collins (Michael Hillyard) and it ruins the whole video! Sorry, that's just my opinion. But if you like her tho this movie is for you."
2,Not her best,"I do like some of Emily Hendrickson's writing, but I did not like this book. The heroine, Juliet Winterton, despite the fact that she is supposed to be quite sensible, kind, etc., does many illogical things (like imagining she can pretend to be the viscount's wife, go about in the village *as* his wife, and not in doing so force him into marrying her) and many unkind things (constantly speaking to the viscount as though he were some shady character trying to take advantage of her when she's the one trespassing on his good will, and deceiving most everyone).I liked the viscount, but I found it very unlikely he would put up with Juliet's shenanigans.If I hadn't so disliked Juliet, the book might have been pretty good, but there you go. She irritated me beyond belief."
4,I am giving this four stars......,"although parts of it were a five. It wasn't brilliant, but I really felt it kept to the spirit of the Regency period, and to the old-fashioned Regency romances. No smut. Just a very sweet romance. Maybe I am just getting old and cranky, but I really miss a well-written romance like Georgette Heyer used to write. I am tired of gratutitious sex scenes in romance novels...b;ah blah blah blah 10-page sex scene...blah blah bla hanother 10-page sex scene and on and on. I almost think these authors put the sex scences in a template and write crap around them just to fill pages. This wasn't one of them. Do I wish the characters a little more developed? Would I like to know why was Juliet's father such as ass? Yes-but bottom line, I enjoyed it enough to write a review."
1,A Dud of a Wrestling DVD,"I bought this DVD because I am a Curt Hennig fan and wanted to watch it specifically for the Hennig vs. Nick Bockwinkel match for Bockwinkel's AWA Heavyweight Championship. The problem was, this match was nearly forty minutes long but it was edited down to less than ten minutes! That's right, the folks from Superstars of the Yesteryear took what was a classic and edited down to less than ten minutes. The rest of the line-up was a ""Meh, who cares?"" line-up of forgettable matches. Get the Spectacular History of the AWA if you want to see the Hennig-Bockwinkel SuperClash II match in its entirety and skip out on this disappointing dud."
1,Smart Questions: Learn to ask the right questions for powerful results,"This is more an academic work than a practical guide. The authors take an incredible amount of words to make their points. I am sure there is some good stuff in the book, however you will need a lot of time and patience to find it."
5,Swiss Army Knife,Excellent workmanship. Knife has about every practical use you can think of. I highly recommendVictronix Swiss Army knives.
3,not a safety locking blade,"It's a useful knife, of course. The only reason I am writing this review is to warn people that it does not have a ""safety locking"" blade, as advertised. The product description states: ""Two blades (one safety locking)."" The large blade snaps open sharply and it is difficult to accidentally close, but this is no different than other SAKs I've owned. I expected that closing the large blade would require pressing a button or some similar operation independent of moving the blade itself. There are other SAKs, such as the Nomad, which have a genuinely locking blade."
4,Filled with knowledge every teen girl should know!,"When I first saw this book I thought it would be interesting to see what other girls think about guys. Julie Taylor has a very interesting perspective and I enjoyed reading her book. Girls like to pretend they know everything about guys, but really, the truth is, we don't. But with this book, you'll definitely be clued in on basic topics involving guys. Do you need to know some good pick-up lines? They're in this book! Want to know who your ideal guy is? Find out in this book!"
5,THIS GUIDE ROCKED!,"This is a great guide for girls with unaswered questions about guys,It talks about breaking up,hooking up,rape,depression,first dates,crushes. It has it all you could think of.I read it so many times, I t really helps you through it. All u girls out there should buy it.It wont let you down!"
3,Needs updating,"Some of the information was good, but a lot needed to be updated to questions and issues teens have now. Made a pretty good opener for conversation with my daughter, I just filled in the rest of the information she needed."
4,Not a true mystery or suspense but engrossing,"Since you know who committed the murder and why (as described in the editorial review and very early in the book) there is neither a mystery or very little suspense here. But like her other books in the series, Wright focuses more on character study and the relationships among those affected by the murder rather than lay out a typical who-dunit.I frankly found the main character, Zoe Strachan, to be the most fascinating feature of the book because her gross inner imperfections contrasted sharply with her outward stunning beauty. The one fault I find with this book, however, is that Zoe is perceived by others and perhaps Wright herself as evil, when in fact many of her actions are driven by acute mental illness. The former has you rooting for the character's demise; the latter has you hoping she gets treatment.All-in-all, a very good read."
4,Interesting Killer,"I enjoyed this book, though I thought a few aspects of the main crime were too clumsy. I never felt like she'd ""get away with it"" and that detracted from the suspense. But the character of Zoe was worth it, fascinating--very cold and literal. Good read."
3,Descriptive and lots of photos...but limited,"I found Clevelands Bottle Pricing Guide easy to use and I loved all the photos, which were very helpful. I did find information and pricing on some of my collection. However, I did not find any information on several of the bottles I'm researching which I thought fairly common. But, there are alot of old bottles out there. This book was informative and easy to use and is a welcome tool in my library."
4,Helpful book!,I love all kinds of Glass! I have found a lot a glass bottles and this book has helped me to see if they are worth anything. Some of my finds are in this book but most are not. However I have gotten several more bottle books on Amazon.com. I am sure I will find what I need in time :)
3,Not the original recording,"Obviously, by simply comparing the CD to the original LP, you'd find that this is not a duplication of the original LP. It's missing 4 songs from the original LP, while adding several from subsequent LP's, and it includes a pretty good studio outtake as well, in The Nearness of You.Also be aware that C&J; have not made any money from the original releases, and will not profit from this release."
4,Intense - Complex,"This is a great cd! I had the opportunity to listen to it being webcasted in entirety and the whole thing is great. From the slow downtempo beginning to an almost intense goa trance building upon each other to a major climax. Excellent sampling and nearly unnoticeable track changes. Definitely a great winner, it will be stuck in my cd player for quite some time."
4,Adjustability of the legs are great,I bought this for my bf who broke his leg and can't put any weight on it for 1.5 months+. Getting in and out of the tub would be very dangerous or nearly impossible without it. The legs on these screw up or down so it is easy to adjust it to be leveled so the chair is stable. The side handle is too small to be useful. The soap dish isn't too useful either. The medical supply store was charging more than twice as much. Thankfully I have Amazon Prime and ordered it when we were still in the hospital so it arrive the day after we got home.
4,Makes Showering Easy,"I recently had achilles tendon surgery, have been unable to put weight on my foot, and have had a cast. This bench has made getting in and out of my shower easy, although one word of caution: I have my bench situated so that it is under the flow of water coming from the shower head. If you position yours like this, make sure you are seated on the bench BEFORE turning on the shower head. The bench does tend to be a bit slick when wet!! The fact that part of the bench sits outside the tub and you can slide across it and, if you're like me, you can position the cast on the side so it is somewhat elevated, is a great thing. I also love having the back on the bench. It makes it easier to recline back when rinsing."
3,Shower Bench Review,The Soap Dish is in a very inconvenient place underneath the grab bar - on the opposite side of the bench there is a small drainage indentation which is much too small to properly clean out after showering and which does gather body soils.
3,Carex Transfer Bench,"We ordered this for my 85 year old mom to use during her stay with us at Christmas. It arrived just in time, but had a crack in the bench. As we had no time to return it before the Holiday, we patched it up with duct tape. The bench itself works well as a shower/bath aide, but the quality control at Carex leaves something to be desired.Amazon replaced this at no cost after the holiday and paid for shipping to my mom's home in Florida. Good customer service."
2,Not what I thought,"This CD is not what I thought it was. I was suppose to get the sermon, but, as it turns out, I didn't. This is something else. I'm not happy with the purchase."
5,It Doesn't Matter Where You Are,"I have a number of favories from the He-Motions Music CD such as ""It's Doesn't Matter Where You Are"" with Bishop Paul Mortan and ""Where Are The Fathers"" with Israel along with ""Thank You For Staying"" with Crawford-Greathouse. Bishop Jakes has blessed us for years with the spoken word and with music it's just a double blessing!"
2,broke on first use,For $12.00 what did I expect. First time I used it I was forcing the stick too hard over. Monsters were catching up to me. I purchased a second one. I'll try to be a little more gentle on it
4,Excellent transaction!,"I was extremely happy with this order. The joysticks were exactly what I ordered and were in excellent condition. My sons were amazed at the ""archaic graphics"" I was relegated to on my old Atari (which still works) compared to their Xbox 360. But they had fun playing the games. Enduro and Keystone Kapers were a big hit. Thanks!"
1,Crypto-islamic Apologetics,"Touched by Isa, yes- but presents some weird apologetics for crypto-Islamic-Christian syncretism. Reader beware! Mina and her husband have been slinging the same hash for 20 years- double check their claims."
2,Deceptive,"The transfer bench in the picture is not the transfer bench they send you. The outside crossbar is no longer on this product. Carex is cutting corners. The transfer bench you receive will not last as long as the previous (pictured) model. This transfer bench will wiggle and shake during transfers before long without that bar. It is a shame a company has a solid, durable product and streamlines it to save money on production. Disappointing."
4,A product I will recommend,The multiposition adjustable legs are the reason I gave this 4 stars. That helped when adjusting it for my mother's tub. The reason I did not give the product 5 stars is I wish the legs were an inch lager in diameter to increase the stability sensation when sitting on it for my elderly mother. I am a therapist and have recommended this product often.
1,"Shallow, poorly written","Shallow, incredibly 2D characters. Fast but moderately predictable plot. Douglas Adams style humor in the plot, but not the writing. Terry Jones makes it obvious why he writes for movies and TV but isn't a novelist. Badly interrupted dialogue. Overall, not particularly funny; hard to read; and the only redeemable characteristic is the rather good introduction by Douglas Adams himself, and that just describes the process of how the book was written."
4,Funny book,"I thought the book was very funny and entertaining. There's also an amazing coincidence, my name is Nancy, I'm 19, and about to major in Art History, you have to read the book to find out why that's a coincidence."
1,I expected more.,"As an avid fan of Adams and Jones, I really expected a, well, funnier book. Instead, what I got was a hastily thrown-together narration wrapped around what is essentially a computer-game plot. Elements of Adams and Jones tend to collide rather than gel and the noticable lack of Adams-style tangents and in-line jokes makes for a rather dull read. I really wanted to like this book, but, couldn't. Sorry."
1,A bad quick read...,"I was very disappointed in this book. I am a fan of both Douglas Adams and Monty Python (here represented by Terry Jone). Unfortunately, the book which is based on a forthcoming CD-ROM game, reads like a CD-ROM game set to text. It lacks the inventiveness of a full-fledged novel (humorous or otherwise). I didn't give the book a 1 because there were a few funny, inventive moments widely scattered in the text. Wasted money for me."
3,It's No Douglas Adams. I don't recommend it,"This is no Douglas Adams book, that is clear from the first page. Though you can see some of Adams' handy work it doesn't help rescue this book from sinking.The best thing about this book is Adams' name on the cover. The characters are one dimensional and weak, the plot tired and the premise of the Starship was mishandled from the beginning.The thing that makes Adams' books great are the compleate off the wallness of the characters and the insaneness of the plot and the way it all comes together (or at least goes somewhere) at the end. This book just drags us along with its sorry characters into the murky depths.My recomendation - don't get on the boat. If it says Titanic it means trouble."
2,Wasted talent,"Take a computer game written by hilarious author Douglas Adams, get Monty Python's Terry Jones to write the novel (naked), and you get...a novel that reads like it was based on a computer game. Some talent shines through, but not worth it for me."
2,Don't waste your money on this one,"I played the computer game, I got the book. I loved the game, I destested the book. It was ridiculous. Absolutely nothing happened, and it in no way resembled the game. For example, the main idea of the game was to find the parts to a cyborg's face and brain. They did mention this in the book, but it took up about a paragraph. The book shouldn't even have the same title as the game."
1,possibly the worst novel ever written,"The plot has promise, but the execution is incompetent, and the (attempts at) humor infantile. Let this be a lesson to us all: do not allow someone else to write your novel."
3,Readable,"This book is funny. Nice. Homoristic-sci-fi preatty good. But if you write ""Douglas Addams"" and ""terry Jones"" on the cover, you need to do more then just funny! I think the idea of writing a book AFTER you making the game need more thoughts. This book is nice, and it is all toghether readable (I read it in 3 hours). But it don't really worth the names on it."
1,"Adams/Python Fans Beware: Iceberg, Right Ahead!","As a big fan of Douglas Adams' early books and a huge Monty Python fan, I readily bought this book when advertised in the most recent version of Hitchhiker's Guide. Starship Titanic (the ship) may be able to travel to the outer spiral of the Galaxy in 3 Dormillian days, but Starship Titanic the book goes nowhere slowly. Populated with shallow characters that are not so much unlikable as they are incapable of generating any feeling toward them at all, the thin plot plods unentertainingly through its mercifully brief 245 pages."
1,A Sad Attempt to Market Douglas Adams's Name,"If Douglas Adams were dead, he'd be spinning in his grave. This book, billed as a 'Douglas Adams' novel, is really just a very cheap attempt by Terry Jones (a very funny man) to write a book in the Adams style. It does not come off very well -- in fact, it reads rather like a piece of low quality high school fiction. The book is based on a stragegy game by the same name which was designed by Douglas Adams -- the book appears to be an afterthought inspired by the game. So, if you're looking for some new material from Douglas Adams, get the game, or go back and re-read some of the classic Hitchhikers or Dirk Gently novels. You won't find anything of that calibre here."
3,ok...just ok.,"its an ok book. a bit ""campy"" and a bit more slapstick in humour then douglas adams books, lacking in the wit of douglas adams but still amusing."
3,Bought for the Reader - Book Fair to Good,"Although I had read the Hitchhiker's Series, was unsure about this one, until I saw Terry Jones was the reader. He made the audiobook. As for the book itself, pretty good, especially the bomb. Probably one I won't re-listen to."
2,What a srtange book.,"Starship Titanic is a curiosity. I read it in one day, but I really don't think that it mattered that I read it at all. I enjoyed it, but I am not sure that I really am glad that I read it. It is based on a video game and I just didn't understand much of the action (mostly sex and arguing about free upgrades). I would recommend this book only to Adams or Python fans. First timers shoould read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."
1,Worst book I ever read,"This is one, if not THE, worst book that I've ever read. If you're interested in the plot, go play the computer game instead of reading this book. Douglas Adams actually worked on the game, for one thing. It's like Myst meets Hitchhiker's Guide. It's fun, amusing, and it's got puzzles. The book, which he didn't have much of a hand in, is horrible. Really, trulely horrible. It's no wonder the game didn't sell all that well if this is what people read. This book is random, pointless, and not at all funny. I chucked it shortly after I got it. Of course, that meant I had to find some poor being to pawn it off on, so I donated it to a library instead. I actually feel sort of guilty about that, since it really was that horrible. What if *gasp* someone actually tries to read it?"
4,"Good, but not THAT good","I read this book expecting something along the lines of the hitchhiker's trilogy. I got something completely different, but funny in it's own way. I attribute it to the book not being written by Adams himself. Terry, if you read this, write a book of your own, OK?"
1,Just can't pull it off...,"Adams puts a large number of diversions and subplots that add to the ultimate goal of the ""Hitchhiker"" and ""Dirk Gently"" Series: exploring human nature through the bizarre. (""What?"" I can hear 12-year-olds screaming, ""You mean it's not just escape fiction?"") Unfortunately, Jones doesn't reach that level, and _Starship_ tends to remain at the silly and shallow."
2,Monty Python members fails to grip as Adams surrogate,"Terry Jones tries hard. You have to give him that. His one-liners may be great, but he fails to emulate Douglas Adams in furnishing that essential interconnectedness of the Hitchhiker's trilogy, with plots, sub-plots, sub-sub-plots, ad nauseam, all explained and part of a fine, funny fabric. This is a take-off on the Titanic and unfortunately for Jones, this will also sink without a trace, and no, no mega-million blockbuster will be filmed of it."
3,"Good, funny, and in line with Douglas Adams' fare","Terry Jones isn't Douglas Adams, for sure, but he's damn close. While this reader didn't care for the scenes involving The Journalist and Lucy, the rest of the book is funny. The Bomb is funny, if a smartass, and you have to like the characters. Oh, damn, now you've made me lose count. Recommencing countdown. One thousand. Nine hundred and ninety-nine. Nine hundred and ninety-seven..."
2,Another sinking!,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the Hitchhiker series, I found this story most lacking in the wild lurches of plot that sustained the humor of Adams' other series. I have the computer game and I'm not certain it's any better."
5,Not very good,"Douglas Adams is now outsourcing his writing! How disappointing. I will try the interactive game, and I hope it's better than the book."
3,"Humourous but very, very Adult","I've been told that Sex is what got me here, so I shouldn't be disgusted. I suppose I shouldn't. But what am I to think of a book that talks about it so excessively and describes it so explicitly? Don't get me wrong, I think it's quite a funny book. At least for about the first half. The second half started out disgustingly raunchy, then not quite so raunchy as it was eye rolling. I liked the characters in the book during the first half. I thought that they were witty and inventive. Then, much to my dismay, Sex was introduced to the story. All the morals the characters seemed to have in the first half suddenly vanished! I love both Douglas Adams and Terry Jones. I thought that the idea for the story was a good one. But it seriously could have been cleaner. At least now I know why it's in the adult section in the Public Library, tucked behind Peirs Anthony and Terry Brooks."
4,"Funny, Smart, and Amusing!","I think Starship Titanic had a great plotline but could've been writen a smigin better. Just one question for Terry, why did you leave the parrot out of the story and made it a big deal in the CD-rom."
2,Novel or script?,"A good rule of thumb; If you are a good movie director or actor, don't write a book. Starship Titanic, when read like a movie script, is quite good. But for us book lovers out here, please try again, and think it out more this time. If it wasn't for Adams' name and the few funny lines here and there, I would give it a 1 and get my money back. Maybe they should make it into a movie. Hmm..."
2,"Ugh! Not cohesive, amusing but not funny...","I really wanted to like this book as I really like both Adams and Jones.Unfortunately the book is not cohesive. There are amusing lines and the potential for funny setups but it never really delivers. It needs more depth.By the time I was done with the book I was not only suprized that it was already over but also left with that strange taste in my mouth, like when you eat some new foreign delicacy that leaves you wondering ""What did I just eat and do I like this?"".This title is not at all worth the cover price. Only buy this at discount or better buy used."
1,"Wow, what a disappointment.","I'm so bummed. I thought that this would be a really great book, well within the spirit and method of Douglas Adams. What a crushing disappointment. The dialog is wooden, the characters shallow, hopeless caricatures of themselves, there's no motivation for their actions, and the writing reads like a parody of Douglas Adams. I'm only halfway through, and I don't find the book engaging, interesting, or even vaguely engaging. I must admit that I've read nothing by Terry Jones in the past, but I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams, and have read all of his books several times. For those that might be interesting in purchasing this, I discourage you from doing so. It is, in my mind, the only flaw in the writings of Douglas Adams. Although he did not write it, he certainly had a hand in it. I'm left wondering: What was he thinking?"
3,Actually rather bad...,"After hassling my bookstore for three days (a while ago), I got my hands on the book and read it in one go. Not because is was very good, but because I was waiting for the fun to start, which never really did. I finished the book, tossed it in a corner (far away from my other, loved, DNA stuff) where it'll probably stay for the rest of its sorry life. I felt somewhat had, because I had bought a book which sole purpose was to sell a lot of books (DNA fans will buy anything he puts his name on) and a lot of computergames. It has it's funny moments, but the way in which the very simple story is told is shallow and never makes one wish it was longer. One of the biggest mistakes is the title: It's just extremely tacky and lacks every kind of creativity. Anyone could come up with a title like that. Just not a good book.Douglas (if you read this, as you should): Move somewhere really remote, bring your laptop with only a word processor installed and start working!"
3,"The Hitchhiker's Guide it is NOT, but a fun read nonetheless","After reading all of Douglas Adams books, I found reading someone elses words (although Mr. Adams idea/outline) to be somewhat odd. It was like blowing my nose and wondering afterwards if that was really my snot in the rag. It felt good when I was done, but left me with a feeling that something was amiss. British dry humor has always appealed to me, so Starship Titanic will fill a nice niche in my ""Books to Read While Traveling on Vacation"" shelf. Don't expect too much from this book...just have a nice cup of tea and enjoy."
1,A commercial for the computer game,"This book was written entirely to promote and support the computer game Starship Titanic. This is not a true Douglas Adams book, and he should be embarrassed to have lent his name to such a blatantly commercial product. This book is the equivilent of the pulp novels written after movies are completed in order to promote them. Play the game Starship Titanic on your computer, but don't waste your time on the book. If you want to read some good science fiction, try Philip K. Dick."
2,It was not written by Douglas Adams,"I was quite suprised to learn from the book's introduction that it was not written by Douglas Adams, even though he is listed as the first author on the book. It was somewhat entertaining, but it definately was not the quality I have come to expect from Douglas Adams."
2,Urgh. It's just not Douglas Adams.,"I really didn't like this. I wanted to like it, but I didn't.Maybe I would have enjoyed it if I was able to not compare it to Douglas Adam's writing, but I couldn't separate it. I thought the writing was poor, and the plot line didn't grab me - I didn't even finish reading this, and I very rarely put down a book without finishing it.I would give this a miss."
2,No quite Adams,"Tthe style is nearly ""Adams"" with the familiar bizarre allusions and delightful asides. It lacks the coherence of plot that bound the wit to a unifying purpose. Entertaining but not gripping.... Like a Monyt Python script that has been extended too far."
2,Better on Audio,PLEASE remember that Douglas Adams began this series as a radio program - that is where his books come alive. Enjoy it in the format that it was meant for...
5,Great CD!,I saw the Rez band many years ago & found their CD here. I ordered it & it was as good as I remembered. The CD arrived very quickly & in good condition. Thank you for such great service!
1,Very Dull!!!,I purchased two videos made by this company and both were very boring. I will not buy anything produced by them. It may serve you well on a sleepless night!!!!
2,"Nice design, but defective","I bought one ""used, like new"" place setting from Amazon Warehouse Deals to see if I really liked the design before shelling out my hard earned cash for a complete service. The set came in the original packaging with plastic sleeves still on the individual pieces, so I don't think it was ever actually used. I liked the design, but unfortunately the salad fork was defective. The little dots were missing for about an inch around one side. This was obviously a manufacturing defect, not caused by wear. Hopefully, this is a one time only problem, and not indicative of Wedgwood quality these days. I think I will keep looking though for something not made in China. I should mention that Amazon returns process was super fast and easy."
2,"good, but......","there maybe 1000 airlines listed in this book, however you have to count them yourself. no listings to tell you what, or where to look for an airline, though it is sort of in alphabetical order. contains a varity of aircraft types, but, pics are small, and, not alot of info per airline. a good ""general"" source book"
2,Don't Have A Whole Lot to Offer,"Don't let the title of the book fool you.1000 Airlinesseem to be a great buy. Not too fast. This book offers nothing more than a ""quick"" (I mean, very quick.) reference for some of the most obscure airlines in the world. A plethora of pictures and of above-average quality, each picture only comes with a blurb. Details of each airline are omitted and some don't even take up a third of a page.Organization of this book is quite eerie. A lack of content makes it very difficult (and annoying) that you'll have to look up an airline in the back index from time to time. Not recommended."
4,MANY great pictures,"This book has many great pictures. Some of the pictures could have been a bit larger. Brief, but good discriptions are below each picture. Many airlines are in it that I had never heard of or seen which was a real bonus."
4,"Very extensive photographic content, nice reproductions","This is an excellent quick reference guide. The author painstakingly assembled the latest information and photographs of current and former major airlines, cargo lines, commuter and feeder airlines, and specialized air services throughout the world, many of which most people have never heard of. My only complaint is that some photographs are too small and lose their impact. Fewer, larger photos per page would have been more effective. But I highly recommend this to any aviation enthusiast."
1,This CD is mostly and literally completely blank!,This CD is mostly and literally completely blank! It contains less than half of the music it claims to have. Selling this to me is nothing short of theft!
5,The best one out there!,"I've owned this book for years (since it came out) and I literally grab it first every year when I'm planning my christmas cookie list. It it fabulous. It has an awesome variety of everything from the basic cookies you see in the stores, to some international recipes that will give your cookie plate a little surprise. I highly recommend this book. I'm thinking about ordering a second copy for when mine falls apart from over-use!"
4,"Good, but not excellent","This is a beutilful book with some very good recipes. But what I do not like is that there are some recipes that call for cookie or cake mixes. If I want to make a brownie, I do not need to buy a book. Simply, I follow the instructions of the package. It is true that sometimes a mix can be enriched, but I find that many times a recipe changes as the brand of the cake mix changes. There are nice photos and ideas, and international cookies. That is why I put four stars."
1,Very disappointed,"I found the doughs to be difficult to work with (they were very dry and crumbly, hard to roll out, etc...) and I took extra care to follow the recipe exactly. When it comes to holiday cookie making, I like it to be simple and straight forward. I do not want to start adjusting recipe's as I only do this once a year, so for me this book did not work.I was also disappointed in the photo's. You never really got a clear look at what the cookie should look like, as they tended to blur the photo slightly (nice effect, but not in a cookbook!). They also did not always tell you how to decorate the cookie like it appeared in the picture (snowman cookies)."
1,Dry Dough! Dry Dough!,"I'm not saying I'm the best cookie-maker in the world, but I do know how to turn a few out. I tried four recipes in this book -- following them to the LETTER -- and in each one (most notably the mint chocolate chip sticks, the choc hazelnut with caramel & the orange snowballs) the dough came out dry and difficult to work with. Which, of course, resulted in disasters for cookies. A lot of wasted effort and ingredients."
2,Nice looking but don't stay on,I bought these for my little girl for the winter but they do not stay very long no matter what I do. They are cute and look durable but it is a hassle to have to worry whether or not the shoe will be lost as she kicks or moves around. My friend has the Ugg boots similar to these but she has the same problem. I would suggest getting Robeez shoes.
4,Very cute,I bought these for my 3 month old nephew. I bought the hat to go with them. He looked adorable in them. His mom loved them too!
4,"Great, but...","This is a very important documentary of arguably the greatest singer of the twentieth century. The interviewer and Mr. Vickers touch on fabulous anecdotes and background information, which is a priceless treasure. The collection of recording excerpts is a tantalyzing overview of Mr. Vickers' amazing repetoire, but couldn't they be just a little less ""clipped""? In other words, the only drawback to this cd is that a little more balance in favour of the music would have made it perfect. As it is, this is a welcome addition to my music library."
2,A Vickers' fan finds this cd a great disappointment,"In my enthusiasm to own what I seriously hoped would be a collection of Jon Vickers' recorded successes, this turned out to be an extended interview, by a commentator who obviously knew his stuff and a singer who knew only his stuff. The interviews thus are far too long, and the musical selections far too short, to be of serious interest to almost anyone. One can learn almost as much from a quick read of the cd liner notes, as from the interviews, which shows how very superficial Mr. Vickers can be, even on his own turf. Amazon commits an error of its own, by failing to emphasize the preponderance of the interview time. While statements are made in the disc contents section of the product features page, this is too little, too late. I am giving my copy to my local library, in the hope that they can put it into circulation and someone will get some use out of it."
4,"Intriguing, but....","This interview/recording clip collection is absolutely fascinating. Many interesting anecdotes and insights are provided by the interviewer and especially by Mr. Vickers. The recording clips are tantalizing and exquisite, but in some instances frustratingly short! The broad range of material underscores why Jon Vickers is considered by many as one of THE great singers of the twentieth century.I highly recommend this recording as an important historic document and a glimpse of a truly great artist."
4,"Easy read, enough techie stuff to sound ""real""","Enjoyed the book. Purchased it with ""Hey, Ranger!"" and wound up reading it first. Swift read and explains technical details that I never understood until now. Repetition is part of the job. Very exciting repetition! Being from the ""Park Ranger wannabe"" generation, I thought it was cool to hear about the actual skill set and activities needed. I couldn't do it! Enjoyable read, probably not for everyone. If you like Tom Clancy details + adventure - go for it!"
2,Interesting stories but too much technical detail...,"I enjoy books about National Parks and the variety of work the Rangers are called upon to do. While the stories in this book are interesting, there's too much technical detail for a reader who is not a paramedic. Parts of this book read like an official report instead of a compelling rescue story for the lay person. I bought this book at Death Valley this spring when I saw it on the shelf in the bookstore at the visitor's center hoping it would be more like other ranger books I've read like Hey Ranger, National Park Ranger: An American Icon, or Seasonal Disorder: Ranger tales from Glacier National Park. Those books are written more like stories to be told and enjoyed rather than a training manual."
3,"Interesting, but some important details have been left out","This an interesting book about the experiences of a police/paramedic/fireman ranger in the National Park system. Most of what she covers in the book happened in Grand Canyon National Park.There is one problem with the experiences she describes - there are no names and no dates. By no names I mean that she only uses first names such as Ranger Bob or Policeman Bill. I have the book ""Over the Edge"" about deaths in the Grand Canyon (which is very good and I highly recommend) and I tried to cross reference some of the incidents she describes, but it was practically impossible to do because of the lack of last names and dates. This was particularly fustrating because everything else she describes in detail (sometimes mind-numbing detail)."
2,review of Park Ranger,This book was a quick read. There is a lot of interesting information about our national park system. The stories were interesting.
1,disappointed in cd,"i am very disppointed in the cd the production is very weak he does not even sound like the person who sung with kool and the gang i wondered is the voice on some of the songs are really him, there are only 2 song on the the cd worth listening to. i listened to this cd one time and will not listen to it again that how bad this cd is. you would think after leaving kool and the gang his music would be real tight however it is not. i rate the cd a one out ten very poor.farrell."
4,A Brand New Me (HIS Best SOLO PROJECT),"Overall this is a good CD to listen to. JT Taylor sound real good , what I mean is that, JT was not afraid to take a risk on the CD. A lot of music that is played on the radio sound the same. I probably would have given it Five Stars, if was not for the song titles and lyrics."
1,Not well Done!,"'' A Brand New Me'' is a story telling JT's story the last few years. ''Mr Young'' is a skit that is not well done. Tracks #3 to 6 are not well written/performed. ''Marry Me'' is well written and probably the best song on this cd. The only other decent songs are ''How'' (the 1st single released on this cd), and ''Sex on the beach''. JT can do better, and write better. I would like to see JT go back w/ Kool and the gang, or Write songs like the ones that made him famous."
4,A Nice Collection of Quotes for Avid Readers and Writers,"The Readers Quotation Book contains an abundance of quotes about the value of reading, the significance of the written word, and the lasting effects of writing. While I am typically apprehensive about giving praise to quotation books given the ease one can simply search and find a litany of quotes on any topic, there are instances, such is in this case, where its clear some research and thought went into a collection. Gilbar has uncovered some real gems, but more impacting is he also discovered a number of quotations that really get to the heart of what it means to appreciate good writing. I've no doubt if you are an avid reader or a writer that you will find much satisfaction in the contents of this book."
1,Not the solution...unless you love air bubbles,"Before you buy this, ask yourself if you mind air bubbles all over your PSP screen. I, like you, didn't pay $250 to look at air bubbles. It comes with this squeegy thing to push out the air bubbles, but no matter how hard I tried or re-did it there were still air bubbles. I just took it off after one day because I could stand to see my PSP that way. Get a glass magnet and cut it down, it will probably work better than this did."
1,At least it was cheap,"I've got a PSP3001 model and these screen protectors don't actually fit the screen. It's about 10% too narrow, so if you want to protect 90% of your screen...yeah, it's pretty much garbage. Also, the other reviews state issues with bubbles, it's mostly true, despite my best efforts and cleaning the screen first I still got a minimum of 3 air bubbles."
1,not whats in the picture,"this product came in a whole new different package than whats in the pic. it also was to small for my psp screen although the one they did send had a picture of a psp game on it, it was more like a cell phone screen cover!! maybe they were out of the product you see in the photo, and just opted to send what they wanted in its place....so now i have to send this back and choose another option with only 6 days till christmas...."
2,"Has a purpose, but not perfect.","I probably installed it wrong, but the screen armor does not stay on my psp in the corners."
3,safe screen is nice...,"it realy is nice and very useful, but the only down part is that it only comes with one film"
4,"Great product, hard to put on.",If you have a PSP and didn't buy this on day one. Then just go get one.Very helpfull and not big and clunky like most protectors.Woul never know it was there.It is hard to put on and you get only one chance.
2,Dissapointed,The product features indicates that this item comes with 2 screen protectors. The one I received only had 1 protector screen which means if you mess up on the application you dont have a back up. Which is exactly what happened in our case. We will be contacting the manufacturerer's customer service and/or returning this product. Definitely not worth the price.
1,Does NOT worth it...,"I tried to apply the screen protector in every way possible to my psp... After 10 minutes and two screens in the trash I kind of managed to do it properly. All my electronic devices have screen protectors and I have to say, this is THE WORST OF THEM ALL...Don't buy it, the instruction sticker is impossible to remove without thinner or alcohol...Huge deception...."
2,Screen Protector for PSP Failed,"The Intec PSP Screen protector would probably be ok if there were 2 screens included. You have to be wxtremely careful putting the screen protector on, if not AIR BUBBLES!! Make sure the PSP Screen is clean and careful put the protector on. If you peal it off and try again, it just doesn't work to well."
5,"Great product, easy to apply","I don't understand why people are having so many problems with these screen protectors. I bought them followed the instructions and used the tool provided to get rid of air bubbles and I got a perfect seal on my PSP screen, no air bubbles, no dust particles. Not only does it protect the screen but it really helps against glare, the PSP screen finish is almost like a mirror, reflects everything, but with this on it is much easier to see the screen in all kinds of different lights. Highly recommended."
1,Not Worth it,"Personally, why bother? These books can be found online at many locations FOR FREE. There are even Japanese PDFs that Americans use because they contain the pictures. I personally have put together a CD-R with these books and many more of Baum's."
2,Bellini La somnambula,"Apparently, in this day and age, our sound preferences have changed a lot. We look for clarity, dolby style sound, with the quality being the center piece.I like to watch operas in my house because, although I do not have the excitment of the direct view, the sound and video are excellent. I made quite an investment into the sound and video systems that I work with. The DVD in question, does not provide the today's exigence for neither the sound or for the image. It is deplorable to watch, and it kills the beautiful Bellini's music.It is only for the collector of music history, or for the ones that would like to have the material proof of the evolution of the recordings and their quality, during different stages of electronic discoveries, in time."
1,booooorrrring,"This kind of thing has been done so many times I can't believe someone would mine it again. Plus, Suler has little to no idea how to copy Nick Drake so what is the point. Pretention abounds. Run away, run far away."
4,As advertised,"Had long ago lost this CD and was misssing it, and its out of print. As usual, found it on Amazon at a reasonable price, both new and used. Made a seledtion and it worked great, as usual. I have never had any problem with Amazon and this product was exactly in the conditons advertised."
1,Surprised and disappointed,"This was the first time I ordered a used home school workbook on Amazon and it will be the last. When it was listed as in ""good condition"" I wasn't expecting it to be written in - a lot ! Why would I want a workbook that was 1/3 filled in ? Having home schooled for 24 years and purchased used books whenever possible, I was surprised and disappointed. This is my first unsatisfactory used purchase from Amazon. I incorrectly assumed this workbook would have very little writing in it because it was not a good fit for the student or teacher, making it nonreturnable but useable. I felt the seller was deceitful by not disclosing the amount of filled in units. So,I ordered a new book from the publisher so I knew what I was getting and can start in the beginning. Mary Ann Chadds Ford, PA"
5,Can't Touch This For Any Level,"If you are serious about playing the Blues, this is one of the best investments you can make. It's a logical, precise step by step building process- packed with usable Riffs, Theory and Technique. There is not book out there that comes close. Richard Daniels is my Blues Guitar Guru. See for your self. I read it cover to cover before I started studying the lessons. There is a clever story-line threaded throughout the book which makes this an adventure. ""Blues Guitar Inside and Out"" by Richard Daniels has my highest recommendation."
4,a comfort,"it is a comforting book. i laughed and cried while reading it, i found susan's way with words very touching and 'real'. i only rate this four stars instead of five because i feel she isn't reaching her full potential with this book, she has the talent to go so much further!"
2,poor value,"this product met my needs in terms of what I required, to use a recipe for coffee and cinnamon lollipops (an adjunct to a recipe found in the ""Food and Drink""Magazine last year. However be prepared to pay four times the cost of the item in postage. The product is about half the size of a CD case width wise and about the same size in dimensions. It weighs less than an average CD case (minus the CD). The box it came in was approximately the size of two shoeboxes. In hindsight I should have ordered three for the recipe but I won't order again, only to pay the crazy shipping."
1,Whitman Statehood Quarter Folder,"I was disappointed with this folder. I have become interested in collecting the Statehood Quarters and wanted a folder in which to keep them as they are issued. However, with this folder it is necessary to collect quarters from both the Denver and Philadelphia mints - something I was not interested in doing. Unfortunately, unless you collect both sets, half of the folder is left empty. I wish they would have made separate folders for each mint instead of combining them as they have."
1,Where's book #2 !?!?,This folder is fantastic... with one exception: I can't locate a copy of book #2. Who wants to collect only books 1 and 3? Do not buy this book unless you have already located the subsequent folders.
4,Düsseldorf again,"While I prefer the first album by La Düsseldorf, this is still quite essential listening material."
2,Not user friendly,"Lots of pictures and information but poorly organized and incomplete. For instance, on page 141 there is a section entitiled ""The Fastest Bug on Eight Legs""....but the article never tells you HOW fast the windscorpion can travel. There is no index or table of contents making the book extremely frustrating to use. I would not recommend it!"
3,bugs are nice,I am really random and I don't know what the hell i'm doing. I think that I have gone mad. I read this book one day while eating a jar of pickles. I like pickles they taste very nice and I got addicted to onions while reading this book and eating pickle. BOY DO I LOVE PICKLE!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Book of question of the Bible,This book allows one question to be answered per page. It is a charming book about facts in the Bible.
4,Fein Drill,This is avery precise and powerful drill. I first tested it driving a hardened screw and it broke it off! Yes it has torque! It also has a finely graded clutch that allows for a light touch as needed. The Battery is a fast charge...very fast like 30 minutes. The balance is wonderful...it does not feel heavy...very east to use. Another great feature is the chuck...easy to really tighten and unlike many other drills it stays tight...I have a number of other cordless drills...Metabo..Bosch...Porter Cable...Panasonic....the winner of the crowd...the Fein 14...I love it!
2,Disappointing.,"I bought this drill because I know Fein tools are some of the best available. However, this drill feels like a Chinese knockoff, maybe because it's actually made in China. The gears have an unnerving tendency to clatter when easing off the trigger, making the tool feel like it's not going to last very long. I returned it. I still will buy Fein tools though."
2,Made in China,"I agree with the review above labeled ""Disappointed."" When I compare this drill with my Milwaukee 14V, the red one is better in every way, and it is made in the US."
4,Awesome,"Shanghai Noon had great music, I really enjoyed it and the movie was great. When you listen to the music, you can picture the scenes of the movie in your mind. This is the best music from a movie that I have heard in a while."
1,Terrible-DO NOT BUY,"I bought this product thinking I had found a steal at 20-odd dollars. I NEVER RECIEVED THE PRODUCT BECAUSE MY ADDRESS FROM YEARS AGO WAS ATTACHED TO THE SHIPPING RECORDS. AFTER CONTACTING THE SELLER AND AMAZON I WAS TOLD I WAS SOL ($H!T OUTTA LUCK). SO LESSON TO THE WISE, READ THE FINER PRINT, ITS A SHELL OF THE CPU(CASE) NOT THE SYSTEM!!!AMAZON WILL NOT GET ANYMORE OF MY BUSINESS BC IT WAS NOT THE FIRST ITEM I HAD NOT RECIEVED..."
4,its a good bag but it needs to be broken in,It's got a great weight and is sturdy but hard to control until its worn in a bit. I would recommend it to hackiers with a higher skill set.
4,RABID HEAVY METAL !!!!!!!,"This album has nothing to do with the one that Gene Simmons produced for Wendy.This is fast and raw,in yer face,dirty sounding,high octane punkcore/heavy metal with Wendy at her shouting best !!!! The drumming is astonishing,it will floor you guaranteed !!!Features the mandatory Motorhead cover JAILBAIT (way better than the original version) and live track (of much better sound quality) which Wendy starts out with a speech on straight peoplethat'll make you laugh your head off.More like early Plasmatics than anything else,but I had to take a star off the 5 it would deserve if the sound were as good as that on the Plasmatics records.It has little treble and suffers from dinamic compression,guitar is low in the mix and has a muddy,kinda muffled sound.Bottom end,on the other hand is BIG.This is one hell of a raw record anyway."
2,"New CD, Sub-par Performance","After a somewhat fullfilling Rerelease of Coup D'Etat with an extra unreleased track one must wonder why bring this half-hearted attempted CD to the masses. A whole slew of tracks (there's five of 'em folks) including one live track! The live track is lacking in the engineering department and live never really sounds all that great on a CD anyway. If you missed a live show while Wendy O. was around then the live track is a, albiet poor, substitute. Save you cash and buy Coup D'Etat or better even still one of the old LPs."
2,"Great voice, plain songs","This record features Wendy in good form but alas, the songwriting and production are really sub par. Very plain, even boring metal songs, silly male backing vocals. The big exception is Goin' Wild, which is a fantastic, raw, energetic anthem, probably the best song ever released by WOW during her solo years. The Motorhead cover is OK, and so is the live version of Ain't None of Your Business. Decide for yourself if this is worth the price of the album.If you like Wendy O' Williams doing metal, better buy the Plasmatics' Coup d'Etat CD. If you like Wendy O'Williams doing punk, better buy the Plasmatics' New Hope for the Wretched CD, one of the best hardcore punk records of all time."
5,Lovely heart warming story...,I just finished this book and it is a lovely story about Gladys Taber and her friend/pet/cat named Amber. She relates the life they have together and the antics of Amber and how she stops everything to hold and pet her and reassure her that she is there and loves her. Since I don't have cats I am amazed at their relationship. Anything that Gladys Taber writes is very interesting and informative and just as tho she is in your home chatting.
2,disapointing,I really like bite down hard and when I found out they released another studio cd I was really excited untill I played it.It sucks on so many levels and is a complete waste of talent and time which is to bad.
4,The Fox is back!,"After a way-too long absence, Britny Fox roars back with a matured sound that still rocks out and takes no prisoners. Fans of singer Tommy Paris who have his solo album, TP2009, will undoubtedly hear his influence on Springhead Motorshark. This new cd boldly meshes the roaring Les Pauls/Marshalls with keyboards/synths, and this formula works!From the traditional in-your-face opening tune ""Pain"", the 70s/Elton John-styled ""L.A."", the downright nasty riffing of title track ""Springhead Motorshark"", the soaring harmonies on ""Far Enough"", to the ending opus ""Sri Lanka"", the cd is a perfect step in the band's musical evolution.Thanks Britny Fox for keeping the musical flame burning, and see you out on the road soon!"
3,"Not as good as I'd hoped, but okay.","This product was recommended to me, as I have very painfully chapped lips in the winter. I've been using lanolin on them, and with how pricy this product is, had hoped it'd be a miracle. Not so much. It's okay, but I can't see paying this price for this tiny tube when lanolin works better for less."
5,THE LONGING FOR GOD AND ITS SHADOW,"THIS IS A BRILLIANT WORK BY A GIFTED WRITER. THE WORK IS ACCESSIBLE AND AT TIMES DEEPLY MOVING. DRAWING UPON HER BACKGROUND AS A JUNGIAN-ORIENTED PSYCHOTHERAPIST, MEDITATION TEACHER, AND RESEARCHER, DR. ZWEIG BEAUTIFULLY INTEGRATES TEACHINGS FROM THE PERENNIAL PSYCHOLOGY WITH FINDINGS OF CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOLOGY TO LOOK AT THE UNIVERSAL LONGING FOR GOD AND ITS PROBLEMS AND PITFALLS. I CITE ZWEIG'S WORK REGULARLY IN MY LECTURES AND CLASSES AT VARIOUS JUNGIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND HAVE RECEIVED ONLY POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM MY STUDENTS AND CLIENTS IN JUNGIAN ANALYSIS."
1,The Holy Longing: The Hidden Power of Spirritual Yearning,I found the book to be of little usefulness. The author jumped from topic to topic without any cohesion and intermingled stories that failed to make her point. I finished the book at laid in on the recycle pile.
4,Tourism: A community approach - for both theory and practice,"In 1995 I wrote my final thesis about travelling and the culture encounters travelling involves. Murphy's work was a great inspiration. At an early stage, he had a clear understanding for the necessity of taking into account the implications of tourism on the community. Now, I find myself in the centre of decision-making - how to plan regional tourism development in the future and I recall Murphy's work. And want to know- has he done more work of a similar kind on social and cultural impacts of tourism. This, I think, is the best recommendation a book can get."
3,Poor Vocals,This bands plays some very heavy music and they do have some catchy riffs on this record but what they lack is more memorable choruses. After listening to this album a few times there was not even one line that was left spinning in my mind. Another negative aspect are poor vocals by some guy who surely can cry but can not sing.Ps. This album is not a classic speed/trash metal. Its more of a doom/trash metal.
2,Stir It Up-NOT,"the music that has been such a part of their signature doesn't show up in this album. I was not pleased with their 'new' sound as it was much more ""modern"" than I like."
4,Go Benji!,Benji is the sweetest dog in the whole world! How can anyone say 'no' to Benji! Kids will LOVE Benji!
1,Seller cancelled this sale,"I Received notice from seller that this DVDBenji's Very Own Christmas Storywas no longer in stock and he apologized. My payment was not processed. So, nothing gained, nothing lost. Therefore the hunt for ""Benji"" continues. Poor doggie's out there somewhere in the cold, looking for a warm home."
