1,Women are not saints,"I have a tremendous amount of difficulty with Phyllis Chesler. It's true that abusive fathers do get custody because they manipulate the court system however not all fathers are that way. She refuses to acknowledge that there are abusive mothers who manipulate the system to get custody. After reading this book and her book about Mary Beth Whitehead she sees women as saints and men as evil. Unfortunately the family court system when I was a kid had that attitude and I was forced to live with a manipulative, narcissistic mother who did a tremendous amount of damage when I would have been better off with my father getting custody. While the family court system does need to be repaired people need to realize that some children are better off with their fathers."
2,Reading this book is an example of time dilation,"The style: a clever high-school student's essay. Formulaic. Exhaustive. The writing: from one professor to another. Cold. Impressive unnecessary vocabulary usage. Goal: to reinforce in five hundred examples what you already know about time duration. It's like a pointless term paper posing as a breakthrough academic study. I guess I was expecting something stimulating about how our brain creates ""time"" through processes and orders. Turns out the title was the only thing clever about the book. But it is relatively short, so if you're bored and want to personally experience the warping of minutes into hours..."
3,A High-Level Textbook,"This is an important doctoral-level textbook in the statistics of point estimation, which leaves the topic of hypothesis testing for a companion book. Using the text is frustrating because of sketchy proofs and examples and the reader is often pointed to other texts for details."
4,Good book,"Good book, but a little abstract for me. It requires some knowledge of measure theory. Some definitions and theories are stated in a more ""mathematical"" language. ""Statistical Inference"" by George Casella would be a good reference for it."
2,It's a nice try!,"The proofs are sketchy and the text contains many mistakes and typos. It only focuses on point estimation, neglecting interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The other texts by Casella are better."
1,A former student GPA 3.90,"First note that this is a text book.This book is good and bad.Good because , this is one of the very advanced books in statistics which cover major areas of the theory of point estimation.But far more Bad, because this books fail the vital mission to make the reader understand the materials. Examples are nearly worthless, because they will point you heavy papers.Button line: if your teacher made you to read this them there is no choice, but if you try to learn theory of piont estimation, KEEP AWAY FROM THIS BOOK."
2,Such a shame,"What we must all realize is that one of the most important reasons people loved Co-Flow's ""Funcrusher"" was because of the lyrics. The never-ending one liners were what really made it a classic, though the beats were undeniably funky, dark, and all around great. That being said, when one sees an all instrumental album from Co-Flow you know you won't be able to hear any jewels of hip-hop wisdom, but you do expect a certain level of bang on the beats. These instrumentals for the most part seem boring and tired, as if they were beats not deemed good enough for the ""Funcrusher"" album. I expected alot from this album and instead got rather boring tracks that went on for too long. Normally I could excuse this, but these are too lazy to even freestyle to, which is the main reason I pick up instrumental albums. ""Little Johnny"" is a big disappointment, if its instrumentals you want, pick up El-P's ""Fan Dam Plus"" instead."
2,Save your money,"I bought this album used without realizing it was an instrumental cd. So when I got it home I was expecting soo much more. The beats are NOT good enough to lay down the cash on this cd. Theyre good, dont get me wrong, but I wouldn't pay money to hear them."
2,A DISAPPIONTMENT,"I happen to think that ""Funcrusherplus"" may be the best hip-hop album ever. For those of you who are fans of Company Flow, the ""Little Johnny From..."" album, will be a huge disappointment. For those of you wanting to MC, pick it up and get some good beats. Don't waste you time other wise. Without the tight lyrics from El-P and Bigg Jus the album is nothing more then a reminder that Co. Flow has a strong original sound. Don't waste your money, get something you'll actually listen to."
5,Godsend!,"I had never tried Calendula oil before and I was so blown away by how well it worked on my face. I had dry skin/eczema at my hairline and after i used this product for a couple days, it was gone. This product also works well for acne and getting a couple pimples on my chin to recover faster than without using Calendula oil. Even though it's oil, it didn't clog my pores. A great product. I will buy again."
4,Calendula Oil,I like the calendula oil. It is perfect to use as a base oil in mixing different blends of essential oils. I will order more in the future.
3,graghic format,"I was found in your book source code for several image file formats such as Gif ,Tiff ,Pcx,Bmp and so on"
1,Don't even consider this a poker book,"What a sad sad thing I've read here. Basically an invitation to buy his other books, and play at Doylesroom and the book does include an installation CD. Absolutely no strategic advice, and nothing but ramblings about the basic rules of hold'em....SAD! Don't buy this book."
2,Blatant Ad for Doyle's Room,"This book reads more like an advertisement and FAQ for Doyle's online poker room. There is very little of value here for the money. Do yourself a favor and buy ""Super System"" or another title that has worthwhile advice."
1,Terrible Book,"Unless you have no knowledge of how to use a computer, this book is almost useless. There is no knowledge here that is unique or will help your game at all. It teaches you things like how to download software, what online poker is, etc. etc.. I got nothing out of it. To add insult to injury, there is a CD ROM for his own website's poker room at the end to advertise his own site. Save your $s and buy someting else."
3,Very Basic Book for Beginners,"If you're just thinking about about playing online, this book will do just fine. But it will not teach you anything you can't figure out on your own. There's not much strategy or anything valuable here. Just an elementary introduction to online games."
1,shocking!,"I am shocked, stunned and appalled that a lifetime professional poker player would take advantage of poker newcomers simply for money! People, a few years ago you parents would have warned you to stay away from people like Doyle Brunsen! Now everyone thinks he is this kind old grandfater type! Get real!"
2,No good for serious players,"I've read many Poker books include Doyle Brunson's Super Systems. This book is nothing like that. The advice to met for true beginners and I read through all the ""important"" stuff in one trip to the bathroom."
5,Good Stuff,"This product is exactly what we need. Mom can't shampoo her hair any longer but still wants to keep ""stylish"", so we use this. She says it feels and smells good. Can be heated in the microwave.The Amazon price, including from medical supply companies, is the best we found on the internety."
3,too hard for beginners,"My son requested these blocks because they were working with them at school. We figured out later that he used the ""speedy carve"" in school-not these. These are for those with experience carving. They are so hard i ended up jabbing myself in the hand with the tool."
3,Tiny Treasure,"This little book of poems can be read in about fifteen minutes. It is a great coffee table, bedstand, or ""john"" book. It contains three poems written by Lincoln that we can definitively attribute to him. They are nicely placed on the pages and easy to read."
1,very very thin and cheap,I ordered this bracelet for a Christmas gift and when I received it I was thoroughly disappointed. The bracelet is very thin and cheap. I probably would have come out better going to the Piercing Pagoda in the mall. Needless to say I had to find a replacement gift for my sister because I would not give this bracelt to anybody.
3,"Factual, Intriguing, and kind of Boring","If you're looking for a good story book about racism, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for factual accounts that are analyzed and researched, then this is the book for you."
3,Disappointing,"I was hoping this might integrate Mintz's insight that thinness is about the symbolic control of consumption with the diet industry. Well, it did in a way, but only by going the tired route of muddling up eating disorders and attempts to control weight, while seeing 275lb women who wanted to lose as the victims of an uncaring society, just like the 130 lb college girls who also wanted to lose. I'm starting to wonder where, if anywhere, we might find sense on this topic. Here we sit, surrounded by size 20s on one hand at size 2 models on the other. There is a genuine crisis. But I can't recommend anything I've read hitherto - except Sidney Mintz. Curious.This is quite well-meaning and has some useful stats on the diet industry, but it's preoccupied with gender irrespective of the way men - and now also nonwhites - have been sucked into the same culture. The gender argument is better in Susan Bordo's work."
2,"Not fair, too cluttered","Not very imformative, keeps on making references to other books, and I hated the ""personal"" stories, all they did was brag and all. The people who told their ""personal"" stories sounded like blond bimbos, oh sure, yeah...that one girl never heard of a guy say a girl was smart and intelligent, uh huh.....sure.I hated the way it was written. It was what the author thought, and pushes you to believe that one this was one way, the way she thinks it is. The author doesn't let you decide, she just gives one side of the issue, not fair!I like the cover-art, though."
3,"The Plantain Season, A woman's journey into adulthood","I read the plantain season when I was a good deal younger than what I am right now, and I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. The time is the 70's and the main character is becoming a woman and experimenting with all of the tools of adulthood. There is some experimentation with drugs, and there is sexuality here as well, but it is all integral to the plot of the story. I really like the way that the author expressed the thoughts of the heroine. They were very real and believable. A really good non serious weekend or long trip book to read."
3,"""Iron Butterfly-In A Garden Of Eden (In A Gadda Da Vida)?","I'm pretty sure I Heard A Piece of ""In A Gadda De Vida"" In the Movie and a Few others that are not on the Soundtrack. If your going to Sell Soundtracks, Do the Damn things Right!!!"
3,One disappointment!,"Over all this soundtrack is good, but, the one disappointment I have is the rerecorded version of the song Brother Louie (my favorite song on the soundtrack). Perhaps it's a licensing issue who knows. If the rights of original recordings are not available then why use the song? Probably most people wouldn't notice or care."
3,I & II Thessalonians,I have used shepherds notes before but this particular study does not have enough study notes to make your purchase worthy of use.
4,good exam prep,"For project managers, McGary gives a quick preparation for the PMP exam. None of the material pertains to a particular technology. Which is a merit of the book. It covers general issues that recur in actual project supervision. Like the allocation of resources. Or the drafting of the Statement of Work. The book does mention some specialised methods (eg. Decision Tree Analysis), but does not go into them in any detail. Since the PMP does not ask for that level of testing."
3,Repetitive sample questions,Multiple choice questions are well integrated in the text and that's fine. But the same questions and answers are repeated at the end of the chapter. And repeated again (after a chapter about ethics) at the end of a part. That's a waste of space as I can remember the questions better than the content. The chapter about ethics triggered my current reaction.I am not experienced in PMI matters and am theerefore unable to evaluate the quality of the content-coverage.
2,Wine opener,I ordererd this because it looked easy to use. It is awful?? I have one that is similar and the arm broke off so I ordered this one - terrible! I would not recommend this item.
5,The best Superman ever,This movie is only a few eposodes of the best kind of superman series yet the plots are orignal and the story line is great. Trust me this is a great gift and must buy for any superman fan.
4,Good,"This was one of Ann's better books. For one thing, it was one of the first ones, so it actually had a plot, unlike some of the 100's. I liked the romance bit-it described Mary Anne's feelings. A great book!!"
5,Great!,"Quiet, shy, sensitive Mary Anne has growing up lately... and the BSC aren't the only ones who've noticed. Logan Bruno Likes Mary Anne! He has a dreamy southern accent, he's awfully cute-and he wants to join the BSC. Life in the club has never been this complicated or fun!"
3,Logan moves to Stoneybrook and gets together with Mary ANNE,"When I first read this book, I was amazed. This was Anne Martins first real love story I had ever read."
1,Unbelievable,"So annoying and wooden, I landed up just paging through it in order to get to the end.Unbelievable that it has good reviews. Buy I most regret."
4,A message to Most Women,"Michaels helps us explore the emotional growth of her main character, Emily. Unfortunately Emily's life mirrors too many young women who put their life on hold in order to help the man in their relationship best the best that he can be.When Emily is sent a ""Dear Emily"" letter she then goes into a major martyr hood mode. Unlike some women when she reaches bottom, she does an about face and starts the process of learning to love herself. This story is a good message to women."
5,"bought as a gift, they love it",I can't personally speak on this dvd because I don't watch wrestling and I bought it as a gift for my mom. John Morrison is her favorite wrestler and she loves the dvd. She said she's watched it 2 or 3 times.
3,not worth 15 dollars plus shipping,I am a huge fan of john morrison but i was not pleased to see only 8 matches on his dvd i feel like i wasted 15 bucks on nothing. Why couldn't wwe do a 2 disc set with disc one being about johnny nitro and disc too being about john morrison. Then they could have packed more matches into his dvd. I have most of the superstar dvd's and all of them except morrosin's dvd is 3 discs. I recommend waiting till this decreases in price. I also want to know why there has not been a Y2J and Randy Orton or big show dvd out yet i think they have been around long enough. Also where are the other 2 suvivor series anthology dvds.
3,OK dvd,"This dvd is just OK, not the greatest. If your looking for a doc. look else where. There's just short segments in between each match, nothing special. the dvd runs 1 hour and 39 min. I would only recommend this dvd if your a big fan of Morrison."
4,Cute but...,The mats are cute but they move because of the smooth back and they don't lock in like I figured they would.
4,VW floor mats,Mats are nice and a good thick quality. Only negative is that there were not holes in the rear mats to fit into the buttons. But they still layed flat over the buttons which has been fine.
5,Excellent,Excellent just like all Whiteside router bits. It's also nice that Whiteside makes all of their router bits in the USA.
5,Dope,i love every onyx cd (except for the d3 entertainment releases) this cd is pure dope from beginning to end pick it up now its deserves to be in your cd stashFavorite Track:Last Dayz8.5 of 10 lyrics 8.5 of 10 beats
5,THIS ALBUM DESERVES 10 STARS!!!,"Onyx's All We Got Iz Us is the greatest rap album ever now and forever. They not only have intelligent and gritty street views but political views as well. In ""2 Wrongs"" they talk about fighting for their rights and for freedom from hell on earth. This energy pumped hardcore album should be in everyone's home. ONYX FOREVER!"
5,Onyx is bac!,"The second Onyx albulm hits harder than the first with Big DS gone it's jus the 3: Fredro,Sonsee, and Sticky but with street anthems like ""Last Dayz"" and ""All We Got Iz Us"" this albulm takes it to the max."
4,Live at 85,This is some of Pinetops best music.Also includes some remakes from other artists.I heard the CD on a college station and couldn't wait to own it.
1,PB8 now acquired by Church and Dwight (cleaning products),"As of a two months ago, PB8 was acquired by Church and Dwight, the corporation that makes cleaning products, baking soda and ARM & HAMMER products. If you feel confident in that, great. If not, time to find a company that hasn't sold out."
2,Buyer beware,"I took this for a few months when it turned on me. It has what they call a prebiotic for the upper digestion. It is called inulin, derived from Chicory root. I began to feel like everything stalled in my deuodum. It proves to me once again that more is not always better."
5,This is my favorite!,I have been taking this product for a long time and recommend it to all who are looking for acidolphilus. I take it as soon as I wake up in the morning on an empty stomach with no problems.
5,it's room temp stable pro-biotics,i love the fact that it's room temp stable. that's pretty rare in probiotics - plus the price is great. i just take it everyday and i think it helps...actually i'm really not sure...but i take it like people drink milk for calcium...i just do it because i think it helps and i think as brands go this is probably one of the best options (at least considering the room temp stable quality).
5,Best product out there!,This acidophilus product is one of the strongest ones out there. Works great to keep your colon functioning properly and your overall body more healthy.
5,"Great book, great band.","This book simply amazed me, its beautiful, and it goes in depth like we have never seen linkin park before. This really does get into their personal lives. Over 200 exclusive photos never seen, and handwritten captions by the band, i dont think this book could go wrong.Theres fun written everywhere in this book. There are amusing photos of towel fights and the guys just having general fun! I reccomend to any linkin park fan. Its never too late to get close, to get inside, what really is linkin park.-Aplacetorest"
5,Think you know everything about Linkin Park? Think again!,Read their first ever authorized book 'From The Inside: Linkin Park's Meteora' and you'll learn a lot of new information. I've been a fan of LP since Hybrid Theory and I learned way too much to talk about here! Did you know that Phoenix has tattoo's? What about movie roles for Chester? What band inspired Rob to play the drums? Why did Joe start directing videos? When did Mike begin playing the piano and why? Did you know that Brad is the band's merchandising coordinator? I sure didn't until I read this book! You will find all these answers and lots more in this book. The pictures make it even more amazing. Some have never been released before now. They will take you into the amazing world of Linkin Park. If you're already a fan you'll love them even more. I loved this book and would recommend it to everyone!
5,I LOVE PRISCILLA,"I don't speak french at all but she is like my favorite singer besides Christina Aguilera. All her songs are soooo catchy and she is sooo adorable!!! BUY THIS ALBUM NOWWWWWWWWW!!! My favorites are Cette Vie Nouvelle ( You may recognize this one from Flashdance..What a feelin...beings believing), Juste pour savoir, Toi C'est Moi, Toujours D'Amour, Quand Je Serai Jeune, lettre, Votre Fille, Teste Moi, Bla Bla Bla and so on and so forth. All of them are worth listening to. She has like 2 or 3 cds. But this one is worth buying!"
4,This was a great book!,"This book was about a quarterback who gets in a car accident and becomes blind. A girl who doesn't know him that well, but has a crush on him, becomes his friend. He develops feelings for her. Do they become a couple? Will he ever see again? I guess you will have to read the book."
4,Cute little book,"Highschool, football player Ken Matthews is in a carwreck which causes him to go blind. He notices that his girlfriend, Amy Sutton never comes around anymore to say ""hi"" now that he is blind, so he quickly realizes how phoney she is.A girl named Terri becomes Ken's friend after Amy leaves him. She helps him with everything, and before long they become a couple.At the very end of the book Ken's sight begins to return.``Katrina"
4,A good album showing lots of talent and promise.,Smap 006 Sexy Six makes a decent addition to any CD collection. There's a good mix of light-hearted pop and more soulful tunes belted out by this popular group of five. Compared to their most recent release (SMAP 012 Viva Amigos!) this album comes out a little on top. Check out Sexy Six (or better yet SMAP 011 Su) for a true taste of current Japanese pop.
1,Nice paper weight,"This product ended up in the trash a few weeks into owning it. Four adults with a collective IQ of over 525 couldn't use the directions which were translated, and done so poorly. The grand daughters use for it was to throw it like a frizbee. I hope the new versions are better."
2,No S as in Little Einsteins,"For those who don't realize, this is NOT the Disney product ""Little Einsteins""Other than that not bad but not good either.Very primitive animation and the software is not very interactive."
5,Sasha Grey!,"I bought this copy for one reason only, and that reason is Sasha Grey.I didn't read or see anything else, so can't really say anything about the magazine itself."
4,Some laid-back West Coast beauty...,"The Dove Shack come correct, no doubt about it. Laid-back vocals and R&B crooning, Warren G producing some of his best work, and rarely any filler. Coming out on the late end of the g-funk spectrum, BoRoc, C-Knight and 2 Scoops released an album that was tight, rideable and at times even danceable. Between the friendly, dance-floor grooves of ""This is the Shack"" and ""Summertime in the LBC,"" they put gangsta blues like ""There'll Come a Day"" and hardcore tracks like ""Bomb Drop."" There's something on this album to satisfy just about anyone, even if it's the skit near the middle... all I'll say is it's entitled, ""Slap-a-Hoe."" Funny stuff... check this album out."
4,This is the Shack,"This album dropped at the perfect time. The LBC was blowin up thanks to Snoop & GW during this time, and the spotlight happened to catch a glimpse of the Dove Shack. They put together a very solid album. The skits throughout are hilarious, The beats are slammin and their lyrics are pretty dope. CD almost plays all the way through. Highly recommended..cop it solely for the Summertime classic ""Summertime in the LBC"".Peace"
4,The First Collier,"YAY. GRANK'S STORY.This book was actually pretty good. I like how there's no nest maid snakes to brag about how great owls are.This is for you magic maniacs out there. There's more magic than the in the previous books.The story starts off really... well, bad. But as soon as H'rath, the High King, dies, the story gets a ton more interesting. That's probably because of the hagsfiends. They're the only part that makes this book worth reading (and those hagsfiends do a good job).Soren and the others dwell in the Prologue and Epilogue. Soren seems to have gotten a major personality make-over, and the rest of the Band just loafs around talking. And yes, there's still the unmoving dying unique to Guardians.This is a cool book if you're willing to spend about 49 pages reading boring stuff (the 127 other pages are WAY more interesting). If you're the patient type, this is a book for you."
5,Wow Just Wow,"Simply stunning. Just like all of Kathryn Laskey's other books, this swept me off to a different world. It felt great to get away. This is the perfect just-before-you-go-to-sleep book, or on-the-couch-with-a-blanket-and-it's-cold-out book. Once again we have gone into the future beyond humans, where we see the animals we left behind win against all odds things we ourselves cannot accomplish today. In one word this book is wow."
3,good.........kinda??,"ok ive only read 3 chapters and i wont finish it becuse of my class project book for the advanced class for fith grade but so far..........its relly boring and i hope it gets better well bye im going to sleep and i am a girl, peace out!! XD ;} !}"
2,Book9 Guardians,It took forever to get here! Did not like the fact that it was not sent until the last possible moment.
1,I miss the swing.,"I see I'm the only one here to give this album a one-star review. And yet, while the others are handing out the stars they say such things as: ""quiet"", ""subdued"", ""not live"", ""not their best work"". I am very disappointed in this album. The symphonic arrangements do not swing, and it feels like the quartet are holding back, to an extreme degree.I attribute a lot of this subdued and ""not live"" feeling to the fact that the symphony orchestra was recorded half way around the world from the singers, who then sang karaoke to the recorded tracks. I wonder if they had any input at all to how the orchestra played.I have no interest in ever hearing this album again."
4,Manhattan Transfer Never Fails...,"...to entertain, to energize, to excite.""The Symphony Sessions"" is great. I love to play it on long drives - I often hit ""repeat"" and listen for miles to ""Birdland"". It's fun to hear MT backed by an orchestra, but most of us know they would sound good singing with anything - a spoon and a tin can! Beside my above mentioned all time favorite, I highly recommend ""Route 66"" and ""A Nightingale Sang in BarclaySquare"", but the whole CD is wonderful. I also would highly recommend MT's ""Tonin'"" which is my CD to go to whenever I need my spirits lifted - don't give a thought to the drivers who stare at you - turn up the volume and SING ALONG!"
2,No power in semi,"Maybe mine is not working properly, but the semi barely has enough power to go on the floor, never mind climbing up over the dirt hill, the idea is cute and the barrels exploding off the dirt hill works well, if you can get the truck to go up and over. The back of the semi attaches easly and it opens and closes nicely, the construction of the toy is durable, but mine has very little power. Wanted to share this since everyone elses reviews are so positive.None of my kids play with it, I have 4 boys."
4,My Grandson has LOVED it!,"My Grandson really has enjoyed this rock 'n rumble toy! He's used it outside and it is still one of his favorites even though he's had it a long time...actually, I was surprised, most toyscan't handle his play. If I have another grandson, I'd have to buy a new one, don't think he's into sharing THIS toy."
4,g funk sound,"yall sleepin on this album. if you like warreng and the g funk sound get this cd. tight laid back beats. round and round,hollywood,eastside lbc best songs"
1,"Waiting to return this, completely blew up in the box. Please let me know how I can return.",Waiting to return this product. It has completely exploded in the box. Please send me info on how I can return.
5,"""A fun and easy to Follow Workout""","This DVD works perfectly for me and my friends!We have some much fun doing the rountines and learn club moves that we vote it 5 stars Aerobics!I've been looking for a good workout video for awhile. My problem, I get bored. I've tried yoga and pilates and just couldn't stick with it. I've tried other dance type videos and just could not stand the instructor. This is a good video since it doesn't try to give you too much choreography so that you can put a little of yourself into the dance and have some fun. The instructor is not annoying and doesn't talk too much. Overall, a good video for people who needed to be entertained even when they are working out.Definately I recommend it for everyone....."
2,And I'm supposed to repeat this for how long?,"I found this video challenging...the first time i did it. Then it just got repetitive. While you do breakm a sweat, she only teaches you eight moves and the background music is not fly. They seem to repeat moves over and over and then surprise: its over. If I hadn't paid so little for it I would want my money back."
5,Great quality product but doesn't fit my 91' s10,"Amazon says it fits, but it's too tall. No problem I just made a spacers for it to compensate and silicone it shut, then ran a wire ground instead of a self ground. Pushes a lot of air and is super quiet!"
2,Boring book,I figured out who the killer was by reading the back of the book. Figured out why less than half way through the book. Very anti-climatic...
1,Great Disappointment,This is the worst book from Jill Jones. I've read all her books & have enjoyed many of them but her latest thriller was a great disappointment. The villian was so obvious that it makes the heroine appear silly.
2,E Double Struggles to Juggle Beats with Lyrics,"On this 1995 release, Erick Sermon displays his P-Funk induced beats and melodies laced with rumbling bass-lines and his signature nasal-happy lyrics. Sounds great, doesn't it ? One would think so, however, this album falls short of a solid, quality LP from this East coast funklord. Despite the standout tracks ""Tell em'"", ""Set it Off"", ""Focus"", and a fantastic appearance by Redman on ""Move on"", the remainder of the album is just filler and not-so-fresh crossover attempts. Although great for mixtape compilations, ""Double or Nothing"" leaves an empty feeling inside your soul, dissapointed by not getting what you expected. Ask yourself, ""Did I really know in the first place?"" Probably not. Peace."
4,essential hip hop lp,"double or nothing by erick sermon is an essential hip hop lp . hip hop was very proud with this . notably its times and movement was well , live , and illustrated confidently with the pressing of this powerfully ill represented piece ."
1,Worst Dance Song!!,"I am a huge fan of old school rap ie. Sugarhill, but I have to say Frankie is just wack. His pop/funk/preudo-rap single Double Dutch Bus plagued danceclubs in 1981 and I hope it never comes back. It has a mind numbing beat, and frankies voice is bizzarre and scarry."
1,Wrong Version,"ok... some of you may know that double dutch bus is a classic throwback record that was sampled by Missy Elliot in Gossip Folks. So, I bought the song only to find out that it wasn't the original 12"" version that contained that hot sample. I bought another one of the versions offered. That was strike two. So, just a warning... if you are looking for that Missy Sample, then you won't find it here."
5,Good song.,"Good song, decent, but a little pricey for a Maxi-single. Still worth it for the memories."
4,An enjoyable read,"This book is well woth the price. Well-balanced, strong characters, vicious bad guys, and a sexy lead man. Aunt Louise, with her platoon of stray youngsters, is a feisty, determined character. Ella is a strong-minded, independant, determined young woman. I had a problem with Harrigan's lack of trust, but this is clarified quite neatly later on. The love scenes are steamy, poignant and tender. I would definitely buy another of Hannah Howell's novels."
1,Skip This One,"I'm usually a big fan of Hannah Howell's books, but I found this one to be a waste of money and time. None of the characters were believable. The scene where the 'hero' went to rescue the heroine from certain death -- I was ready to beat him on the head and tell him to get on with it already. I will think long and hard before buying any more books from this author."
5,Wild Roses,Couldn't put the book down had my interest what was going to happen next. Loved the book and have it on my Kindle.
3,Wild Roses,Thank you for getting the book to me so fast. It was also in great condishion.Thanks again.Liz
5,First Blessing Donkey,This donkey belongs to Lenox's nativity group entitled the First Blessing. The donkey is ivory colored and has a saddle on its back decorated in gold. The blanket under the saddle is also gold. He had a golden bridle on his face and around its body.The body is textured and so are his mane and tail. This is a beautiful figurine and a welcome addition to your First Blessing Nativity collection.
2,Needs larger drainage holes.,"Provides a nice perch for cardinals and larger birds, but plugs easily with seed.Slight rain and you have a mold problem."
4,"Comprehensive, but all black and white","It was a gift for my stepfather who owns a 124 Spider. I just browsed through it so I'm not 100% knowledgeable about how good the content is. The table of contents did seem comprehensive. Maybe I missed it in the description, but I was a little surprised that the pics were all black and white. Either way, he said he loves the book."
2,This book had potential.,"Syracuse, a great city and my hometown, has an interesting history, but unfortunately this books decides to spend a few pages on it. This book seems like it's intended for people who are looking to visit the city, so it has the depth of a AAA travel guide. It does get rather in depth to what the people of Syracuse look like, which is pretty stupid, since people from Syracuse look pretty much the same as people in other cities. It does show some landmarks of the city, but does little to explain their reason for being. To top it off, most of the photos in this book will be dated in 5 years - the list of companies in the end already is. It got 2 stars because it's worth flipping through at a bookstore or library, but not worth purchasing."
5,Tough to transform but u'll get to it in time.,This transformer toy was a challenge to transform even with the help of the manual although manuals are usually not much help. A must for those who like a challenge and surely not for anyone below 10. They will end up banging the thing in frustration and possibly breaking something beyond repair as almost happened with my kid.
5,"Excellent, unique","Having written about credit for fifteen years myself (I am the author of The Ultimate Credit Handbook), I know a lot about credit reports and scores. But I learned even more from this book.Hendricks brings a very unique perspective to the topic of credit scores because of his years of experience as a privacy advocate. I found his references to court cases and the testimony of credit reporting agency executives eye opening. The chapter that explains how lenders often get different reports than consumers, and the subject of ""cloaking"" was alarming.If you really want to understand how credit reports and scores work -- from what I would say is an insider's perspective -- I'd recommend this book highly."
3,Mis-leading title and expected more about scoring,"This book doesn't follow through on analyzing the credit scoring process a the title suggests. It focuses mostly on court cases involving consumers and credit reporting companies instead of getting to the meat and potatoes of credit scoring. In short, it has some pretty enlightening information but not about credit scoring. I'd recommend Liz Weston's Your Credit Score and KE Varner's The Insider's Guide to Credit Repair for additional information."
5,Credit Scores & Credit Reports,"I used this book as the basis for an outline for a continuing education class. I found it to be informative from a historical perspective, helpful in understanding how scores are determined and how to fix credit issues. A must read for all!"
1,Ehh....,"This book is alright. But the author lacks updated and factual knowledge of how the system works. Kudos for trying, though. It's hard to find a book that's 100% true on credit scoring."
1,Boring for the average person,"there are one or two good chapters. the best part about this book are the legal references concerning court cases involving credit. hardly a read for the average consumer. better suited for a lender who deals with consumer credit. in addition, i feel compelled to inform the average consumer that there are MANY statements and chapters that are MISLEADING and WRONG. so be careful. the author doesn't understand credit scoring as well as he thinks he does. but i certainly appreciate the court case references. for that i am grateful."
4,Does what's needed,"I rehab houses and need to make the house not only work but look as though it is worth more than similar rehabed properties. I have now installed this trim kit and balancing valve in some 25 properties. It works, looks good and installs easily. Not much more to say."

2,looks better in the picture than in real life,"I was really excited about this necklace. The picture looked really cool. But in real life, there are symbols carved onto some of the beads (they look kind of arabic to me, I don't know if they are, but I sure don't know what they are or what they mean). The larger beads are not really ""beads"" they are woven balls (they are not hard). This is not something I would wear."
3,Okay but...,"The book is targeted at UNIX users working on the Mac OS X. More than 2/3rd's of this book covers basic UNIX commands & tools that any basic UNIX user should know; things like cp, mv, ln, pine email reader, vi editor, etc. The only somewhat useful information for a UNIX user is the last third of the book which covers things like fink and X Server integration. Throughout, some minor OS X differences are mentioned, like file placement in the directory structure. This is really a UNIX book for Mac users. So the title fits, but the ""Who is this book for"" section is definitely wrong."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","A horrible horrible shovelware book. Riddled with poor explanations, typos,blatantly wrong explanations, and incorporating zero ""big picture""descriptions of how everything fits together. I borrowed it from thelibrary under the assumption that it might be a good quick descriptionof some Unix tools of which I'm not aware, and it failed miserably inthat role. Moreover I'm hard pressed to think of a role in which it would notfail miserably --- perhaps the ""swatting cockroaches dead"" role."
3,Compression drop-outs ruin the fun,"This is by far the best fresh sitcom on DVD today. It's therefore sad the DVD compression is visible at times. I agree with another reviewer -- the compression of all episodes onto one single disc is leaving drop-outs and ""slow-motion"" incidents, probably because the full framerate cannot be kept.And what is up with the horrible non-skippable BBC commercial before the menu appears? Don't you just hate that?5 stars if the mastering was done properly."
5,Father Ted Series 3 - 2 DVD Set,"Plain and simple - Its great! I finally got to see ""The mainland"" episode! I never saw it on BBC America, unless I missed it sometime, I don't think it was aired. This set has so many extras! The episodes even have sections that BBCA cut out from time to time, to make them fit in 30 minute time slots, I guess. If you love Father Ted as I do, you HAVE to get this!Dermot, you are VERY MUCH missed! Too bad more of this wonderful show could not have been made! Series 1,2 and 3 plus the Christmas episode was not enough! This cast was perfect!"
4,Father Ted at its best,"I was initially a bit hesitant to buy this DVD after reading the reviews complaining about the re-recording issues. Yes occasionally there are some 'squiggly' bits in a corner, but nothing major at all. I am a big Father Ted fan, and I believe that the series was REALLY building up some momentum with the third series, and therefore some of the best editions can be found on this DVD. I just wish there were more! I highly recommend this to all Father Ted fans!"
5,"HONESTLY, THIS IS THE BEST HIP HOP ALBUM EVER","I HAVE A COLLECTION OF ABOUT 70 RAP ALBUMS AND I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU THAT THE SHOW SOUNDTRACK IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL, IT REPRESENTS BOTH COASTS, AND HITS YOU WITH 13 CLASSIC JOINTS"
4,Please,"EJ Rupert has a right to his own opinion, blackdragon. Get off of Bone's d**k. Oh yeah, the soundtrack was phat."
3,Animal Farm for many ages,This product is nice. My son is mentally retarded and he loves it. He is seven years old but he is developmentally toddler stage. I play it with him hand over hand so he learns the cause and effect and all the components that goes with it. The animation is something to be desired. It's a little low budget I think.
4,Good design that works,"The best design I have found. Compact, easy to grip and well finished. Fit easily in a small ice bucket with lid.Very good value for price. Much nicer than many others two, three times the price. Designed in Italy- made in China."
2,"Made in China, not Italy!","I have not used the ice tongs yet, but it says on the label that they are made in China, not Italy. They also don't look white as they appear on the picture."
1,By: Nicholas MB The Landry News,The Landry News is not a very exciting book. It has too much detail and not enough action. I would have liked it more if there had been more problems and less conversation. I do not think that this book is one of Andrew Clements best novels. It did have some good parts but was slow through most of the book. I think if you like reading short books or are in 3rd grade or lower you might enjoy this novel more than I did.
5,the story with a good heart,"the book has a great heart it's written from just the right angle, even though the book has no clear in front of your face""this is the goood guy this is the bad guy"" it has it's juiceit's like real life people don't say stay away from him when they refer to a principle or a teacher. the book has a clear point if you were in the same place as this person you would have done the same thing. even though the book is short it's like a haiku a short little poem with so much hidden meaning."
4,The greatest book -By: V.A.T,"The fantastic funny book that i read was The Landry News. This took place at a school that a girl goes to, her name is Cara Landry. She doesn't have much friends except a boy named Joe. the girl Cara Landry on one of her teachers in the editorial section. She wrote about the way her teacher Mrs.Larson , how he sits in his desk drinks coffe out of his red mug read news papers and never got up to teach anybody.Mrs.Larson did not like how Cara Landry wrote about him beind his back. Know longer did Cara Landry write about Mrs.Larson. Finally She found a group of people including her friend Joe. They even got a new name and something happened with the princable... This book was the best book i read so far"
4,The Landry News Review,To me this book was really good. The title is very believable because it's in a school. The plot in the landry news is believable because Cara Landry writes newspapers. The theme isn't that much believable because it doesn't teach you a lot.Cara Landry is one of the main characters in this story. She writes all the school newspapers. Another main character is Mr.Larson. He is a teacher for 5th grade. The last main charcter is Dr.Barnes the principal.I would reccomend this book to pretty much anyone.
5,Great Mystery and Excitement!!!,"Landry News is a good book because it brings excitement and mystery to the reader and it makes you want to read more and more!!!!!!!!!!!!!You learn many lessons from this story such as ""Don't Put People Down"" and ""Good is better than bad""."
4,Katie's Review,"I liked this book because it's a story by Andrew Clements, one of my favorite authors. I also like the book because there's a girl in the story who sticks up for what she believes.Cara Landry is a girl who moves a lot. She is always making newspapers called ""The Landry News."" But when she moves to her new school, her newspaper gets her into trouble. Cara got put into Mr. Larson's classroom. Mr. Larson is a teacher who doesn't really teach at all. He has a bulletin board that kids put up their favorite articles. Cara made a newspaper and put it onto the bulletin board. The newspaper said stuff about how Mr. Larson doesn't teach his kids.I would recommend this story to someone who likes the author, Andrew Clements. I would also recommend this story to someone who works with newspapers."
5,A 5th Grade Journalist On the Lookout For News,"Cara Landry is a journalist that is learning in her school classroom number 145, but not from her teacher Mr. Larson. Of course Mr. Larson, like all teachers does want Cara and his other students to learn, but isn't exactly willing to teach, until Cara and some other class students finally persuade him to.Find out more by reading the book yourself!I'm sure all journalists, teachers and students will love The Landry News, a book about 5th grade journalists with a sharp eye on the lookout for news. I like this book because it's a great story with a happy ending. Its way up they're with Frindle!"
3,A Kid's Reveiw,"I think The Landry News is a truly inspiring story. For instance, when Mr. Larson knew that there was a possibility he could get fired instead of panicking he just started teaching and turned the emotional stir into a journalism unit for his class. The Landry News is one of the best kids books I have ever read! It just feels like you are going through the whole adventure with Cara and Mr. Larson. I think Andrew Clements has an amazing way of grasping the thoughts that go on in kid's heads during school. This story is a great one to read and if you have the opportunity you should definitely read it. I reccomend this book for anyone else who is interested in reading thr Landry News.(Made by an M.B student)"
4,My Review on the Landry News,"My opinion of the Landry News is ok, but out of five stars i would give it four.Don't get me wrong i like this book and i would recommend this book to everyone i know.It is just not my favorite book.The reason it is not my favorite book is because i'm more into mystery,but if you like journalism and realy good writing then you should totaly read this book.One of my favorite part of this book is when Michel writes the article about dviorce, that almost made me cry.Also when Cara went into Dr.Barne's office and told hem about the newspaper that was going to replace the Landry News.The Landry news is one of my favorite books i've ever read,you should read it and if you have already read it, read it again and again.~ MB Megan :-)"
4,Writer scores hit with new school book,"Clements wins again with this short but sweet tale of an enterprising young girl and her burnt-out teacher. The characters are surprisingly complex here, and the plot moves along briskly to its somewhat predictable but moving conclusion."
4,Interesting read!,Good book! Love this author and my kids are enjoying it...we read Frindle first in my reading group and I chose this book to challenge them a little more.
3,Pretty Good!,"This book was pretty good - I have to say. I can easily relate to the problems that the characters had to face. It was very interesting, and it's a great mentor text to read."
5,Excellent and unique look into the effects of the Vietnam War,"I am a military history buff. I especially love to read books written by people who were there, or in this case a person who was greatly effected by the events described. I picked this book up on a whim from a book store and the writing style dragged me into the story. It is truly unique in that it is written by the brother of a Marine that died in Vietnam and that it really does not focus too much on the war. It does cover the basics of that era, but more focuses on the effects the war had back home, as well as the lasting effects on his family.I am glad that Mr. Smith finally found a start to his healing and was able to write this book to share with the public."
4,From a well-read reader,"One wonders if the previous ""reviewer"" simply did not like Merrill's conclusions, which are more in line with conservative Biblical scholarship than the (questionable in my view) documentary hypothesis school of Biblical studies... Merrill has a useful ability to take a great deal of information - hundreds of years of history - and make it manageable wihtout losing the humanity of it. Granted this is done at the expense of increased detail (my reason for 4 stars, instead of 5), but the work is made more accessible by doing so. His language is understandable, which is all the more laudable as he is overtly a scholar. One might prefer different emphases than Merrill, but he can't be faulted for not consulting ""me"" before he wrote the book! I can recommend this without qualms or hesitation."
4,The Genesis of a Nation,"Dr. Merrill's study on the history of the nation of Israel is invaluable to the student of the Old Testament. The writer deals with a variety of liberal views of the history of the Old Testament and does an excellent job showing their flaws and weaknesses. He argues admirably for the conservative dating of the Exodus and the historicity of the historical books of the Old Testament. At times, the writer may give too much time in dealing with critical views, but the exercise is certainly necessary for the student of the Bible. Overall, this look at the history of the people of Israel is one of the best conservative works on the topic."
1,Poorly thought out,"I would have to agree with a previous ""reviewer"" and say that the book itself is written quite well, but Merril states certain things that are obviously not true and can be picked up by almost any sunday school student. For instance, he states that three, maybe four, of the twelve tribes of Israel left Egypt at once and met up later, before the Ten Commandments were given. This, obviously cannot be true because the book of Exodus itself that all twelve tribes left together. His Biblical flaws aside, his writing was good, making the book easy to read and I believe that most of his dates were right on target. It could be hard for some people to ignore his Biblical ignorance, however, and I suggest that those people do not read this book looking for an indepth study, survey and education of the Old Testament."
1,Biblically contradicting,I found the writing style in this book very well developed but the theology and Biblical ideas of it were glaring contradictions of specific things in the Bible. This book is not one that a serious theology student should consider to be a good source of knowledge.
3,An OK option for a 'toy' drum set,"We purchased this during the black friday sale. At that price, it was an OK value. It's definitely a toy drum set--which our 4 year old loves--but is probably too small/flimsy for anyone in the 7/8 year old range.The drums are of an OK quality, but the mounting bolts that connect the drum set together are shipped loose. I had to take apart all of the drums and glue + tighten the bolts to keep them from slipping while the drums are being used. The stool is nothing great, but works. The drumsticks are just sticks, but made of a really soft wood, so they get beat up pretty badly in just a few days of use.At full retail price, it's still probably a decent deal, but if your child is older, I'd maybe consider putting that towards a real junior drum kit rather than a toy set. All that said, our 4 year old loves them and will certainly enjoy them for as long as they last."
1,fake reviews made by seller,"first off, the bottle you get looks nothing like the one in the picture, second of all: DONT fall for this crap. It does not color your hair blonde all it does is put some gold glittery stuff in your hair that makes it look sparkly and oily and you have to use up half the bottle to get even a little bit of a lighter color to your hair. Also makes it feel sticky like hair spry. Not the look you want..unless your going to a Halloween party or something. I dont understand the positive reviews there was NOTHING good about this product and my hands are all gold and glittery now.....waist of money"
3,"good, but not great","Slick Rick is a clever lyricist, with solid flow, but if you're loking for high energy , look elsewhere. If this album had been released in 1985, it would be a four, five star alblum, but as good as Rick is, the beats and music on this album are awfully stale. But then again, I love wu-tang, so maybe my requirements for energy level are different from a lot of other hip-hop fans. Ciao, baby."
1,Hot Garbage,Wow..wackest trash ive heard in a minute. How do yall think this cat is dope? Doesnt take alot of skill tow rite a rhyming story with no mettas or punches...Go buy Some Gang Starr..some de la soul...some Wu...some gravediggaz..anything but this garbage
5,slick rick the Ruler for real.,"This album is a classic. If you are lucky enought o ever get a old school tape of Slick Rick live, check for the original ""treat her like a prostitute"" with even more raunch adventures. Slick is a master as is attested by snoop doggy dogg who admit slick rick was his idol! Mona Lisa still hits and if you play that or lodi-dodi in any ghetto in the USA in your ride - someone on the street is bound to start mouthing the words along with the song as you drive by - Buy this record!!!"
1,this cd [stinks],I think that this is by far the worst cd ever If you want to listen to real wrestling music get wwf the music volume 2 or wwf full metal those cds sound way better than this garbage DO NOT BUY THIS CD
3,A Must have for any Sign Language Interpreter in training,I bought this book when I was taking Sign Language classes through my College. I was hoping that it would have clear pictures to help me decipher some of the signs but it was almost impossible as the pictures werent very dark and they were also pretty small to look at.
2,Wow...too much info for a novice begnner,This book is very overwhelming to me. My infant son is hearing impaired so I'm trying to learn ASL. This is definately a college textbook and not an average readers book. I'm going to get through it some day but wow....it's a lot of info for me as a beginner.
2,Sign language easy way.,I wanted to see more hand sign than explaining what it is.For recreation learner it's too much text book like.
1,Please enter a title for your review,Wolf Parade is like what would happen if you took all the worst parts of Franz Ferdinand and Interpol and left them out in the sun for a week to rot. And then took a dump on it. Wolf Parade is everything that is bad about dance punk distilled into band form. They're like that river of pink slime in Ghostbusters 2. I bet that's how Wolf Parade formed.
4,A Good Series,"Christmas in Switzerland (Christmas Around the World Series) is a very informative book. You cannot go wrong with any book in that series, really. The information is factual and fun and the pictures are very nice to look at. I have almost the whole series and I will continue to enjoy them with my family for years to come."
5,The African Journey of one of the Great photographers of XX Century,"This book has been a surprise for me.Where I expected some kind of fashionable journey through Africa (Hoyningen-Huene was one of the precursors of modern fashion photography) I found an exquisite travel diary with images and very thoughtful notes on the life of Africa during the 30's.Hoyningen-Huene was very sensitive on the state of African history at the time and so he pointed in his preface:""Some day, when the entire Black Continent is clothed and reduced to comparative banality, these documents may prove of interest, revealing a naturalness of form and movement never found in a world of organised artificiality"".I happen to be reading at the same timeLetters from Africa, 1914-1931of Isak Dinesen and I couldn't find a better match to understand those hectic African years."
5,Car Cover for Crossfire,I have had car covers from Covercraft in the past and they have always performed as advertised with excellent fit and always kept my vehicles clean.
5,Absolutely wonderful mystery!,"I thought that Mr. Galligan's first fly fishing murder mystery (The Nail Knot) was really great. ""The Bood Knot"" blows it out of the water. It's a nice, tight murder mystery, that keeps you guessing until the end. It is full of dry, dark humor and bizzare characters. You don't need to be a fly fisherman or woman to enjoy this tale immensely! I'll be first in line for the third adventure with ""The Dog""!"
4,Unexpected twists and turns,"Once again Dog Oglivie is moving around the country fly-fishing some of the best rivers when he gets himself involved with a murder among some Amish people. This one is like the first book in this series in that is well written with great character development. All I can say about the ending is that, if you saw this one coming you are much better than I am. Well, let me clarify a little. I had a suspicion who the murderer was, but the motivation was pure left-field. Would not have EVER come up with that! Great read"
4,coleman tent organizer,"much larger than i'd expected. holds all the little things i'd hoped to organize. very nice product, good quality for the price. compact and easy to use and store."
4,great for the neat freaks....,"no complaints here....lightweight, easy to assemble, seems durable enough for my intended use. Only flaw is I wish the bottom shelf was rigid like the top two...."
5,Stop the cult of greed,Scientology is not as bad as The Jehovah Witness Watchtower cult but it is still evil. The cult causes suicide among the members. Protect your family and community by warning people about this big money mind control operation. Christian Peper
3,"A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianectics and L Ron Hubbard","Al principio es interesante, luego, en los ultimos capitulos, se repite mucho lo dicho en capitulos anteriores.At the beginning is ok, but the other chapter repeat a lot the same that the first's chapter."
1,Target: Funded Black Propeganda to snare Intellectualists,"I reviewed the sources of the material and information depicted in this book; an independent investigation agency. My results, which I feel is my duty to share, is that of a funded effort to undermine an orginization who might be able to give those with intellectual talents to much freedom. Who ever funded this book, had intrests in intellectualists gaining to much control in their own activities. This obviously scares the ""investors"". By doing so, the ""investors"" know what they are more likely to believe by what they have fed intellectualists in the past by dissinformaiton campains. Therefore, it is not my recomendation that you believe what is in this book, it hints at some new anti-self-impovement campain."
1,In a word - RUBBISH,I've read a great many books by Hubbard and others on the subjects of Dianetics and Scientology. This author is hopelessly misinformed and off the mark. Read what Hubbard says in one of his many books and then make your own decision. This is poor journalism at best. Scientology is a group that grows by leaps and bounds each year. Why? Because it has useful information that anybody can (and do)use to improve their life and the lives of those around them. And this is a bad thing? Your money would be better spent on a movie
1,Bias and bile never make for good reading,I found the book so one-sided and self-serving after a cursory glance that I decided not to read it. That the book was found to defame someone is of little surprise.
1,"""Vengence is mine!"" sayeth Jon Atack","I read this book already some years ago. It is - as the many others on the subject - full of biased ""information"" and seems to serve only one purpose: The childish revenge of a certain Mr. Atack on an organization which didn't want to deal with his bad manners and deceitful character and threw him out. What else can be expected by apostates?! To get an idea of the scriptures of Scientology I recommend to check for primary literature in libraries, any Scientology organization (There is plenty of them and they can be found in the phone book) or at amazon.com using keyword search ""L. Ron Hubbard""."
5,A Scam at best,"This is book is one of the preeminent books about the corrupt side of Scientology. I have been involved personlly on both fronts of this organization and was in a quandary for some time when I first left it. This book did it for me and convinced me of the criminal aspects of the organization of Scientology. There is a rosy picture that this group paints of itself and if you happen to hear from them first you might just believe in it; that is why this book is opposed so much. Atack explains from start to finish the exact rationalities of Hubbard 'think' and sets forth a way to combat its anectdotal success stories with intuitive insight and research. Its a must read for those who have any doubts to the copyrighted data given by Scientology. For those who have no doubts to the contrary I say, you were warned."
5,Worth A Read For Anyone Interested,I read and enjoyed this book. It's a must-read for anyone interested in or involved with Scientology. I have a lot of respect for Atack's courage in speaking his mind.
5,Scientology exposed,"Atack exposes Hubbard's bizarre imagination and behavior, tracing the creation of Scientology in the years following World War II to perhaps its final schism following Hubbard's death in 1986. A shocking book that reveals all: the abuses, falsehoods, paranoia, and greed of Hubbard and his pseudo-military Scientologist henchmen.(The above is the publisher's synopsis, which I fully agree with)"
4,On second thought....,"Well, I actually read the thing. Most of it. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars, because some of it seemed like a rerun to me (I've read a lot about Scientology before).Okay, NOW I am convinced that there are a lot of things behind Scientology's doors than members are letting on. I still have to say, though, that applying some of the commonsense ideas (ARC triangle, study technology, emotional tone scale, and the advice on children) really works! Thus, I am in a little bit of a quandary here. Can we admire and practice some of the teachings while abhorring what the leadership has become? (Hey, sounds like most of Christendom--so, yeah!)All kidding aside, this IS a well-written, well-thought-out book."
4,compelling and yet very clinical,"I was so facinated by the subject matter and thought that it was written very well. Except that it was dry for most of the middle section of the book. You do feel what this man and others has endured, and it is very readable, but it was more like reading a text book rather than a personal account. I do recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this subject."
1,They should have spent less time being stoned.,"Trying to make money by screeming obscenities while being on some kind of wierd drug induced mind trip is what these ""authors"" attempted to do.I would be very surprised if they made enough money on this ... to pay for their ink let alone their paper costs."
1,Poorly written.,The author should go back to doing whatever it was he was doing before attempting to write. Poorly researched and poorly written.
4,"THE BOOK for those wondering... ""What is Scientology?""","Atack presents the reader with an unbiased and unflinching look into the disturbed minds of Hubbard and his devoted followers. This book is a 'must read' for any student of sociology, psychology or anyone interested in cults and the effects of 'brainwashing'. Atack's book attempts to unravel the complex mind-control systems devised by Hubbard and gives a unique insight into the lengths his organization goes to in it's attempts to silence free-thinking critics.Highly recommended to those who found 'Dianetics' and other Hubbard 'materials' muddled and incoherent, this book puts them into perspective and leaves the reader with a true sense of comprehension. Re-reading 'Dianetics' and other 'Scientology literature' after 'Blue Sky' proves an interesting experience.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,A chilling but well-written book...,"I found this book incredibly well-documented, and exremely unsettling. I feel sorry for anyone who becomes involved with this highly litigious, chillingly Orwellian-reminiscent, avaricious group. And am grateful for the people brave enough to write or say anything against it, as these people begin a smear campaign (amongst other things) on anyone who they perceive as an enemy (see: anyone who criticizes Scientology in any way).This book gives proof, meticulous proof, of L. Ron Hubbard's tendency toward paranoia and pathological lying. But, he was a clever liar, he made sure to sprinkle little truths in every lie to make it believable. As a future scientist I find it an abomination that this cult be referred to as a science in any way.If you are interested at an in depth, and truthful look at the cult of Scientology, look no further."
5,Excellent expose,"An excellent expose of an insidious and dangerous cult which bases its ""religion"" upon the paranoia and self glorification of a proven charlatan."
5,Eye Opening,"This book should be must read for anyone who's thinking about joining Scientology. Atack does an excellent job of profiling a para-militaristic, totalitarian group. He paints a scary picture of the leaders who send out creepy street hucksters to get your ""body into their shop"" with their ""free personality tests."" He exposes the grandiose lies, hypocrisy and narcissistic greed of L. Ron Hubbard. He makes a strong argument that it is self-defeating folly to follow or worship this bad man."
5,The facts don't lie: Portrait of a fraud.,"I found this book to be both shocking and extremely informative. Having read both Margery Wakefield's _Path to Xenu_ and Russell Miller's _Bare-Faced Messiah_ (both of which are no longer available in print but can be freely accessed on the web), I thought I had seen it all. Not so.Read this book (or Miller's), and compare their description of Hubbard's life to the official bio on the Scientology websites; if you want to know for sure which source has more credibility, a good place to start would be to send away for Hubbard's military records (scans are available on the web), and to see what the US government has to say about the career of this so-called ""war hero"" that was never decorated, and bounced from post to post for incompetence.Don't be fooled by the Church's hype; read Atack's _A Piece of Blue Sky_."
1,I did not like this book.,"It reads like a vendetta. There should be some balance of good with the bad in any biography. L. Ron obviously had SOME good ideas, or rational people like Travolta and Cruise wouldn't admire him so much."
1,What a waste of time and energy! YACK!,"I didn't get anything useful out of this book at all! It felt more like just sitting there and listening to a person justifying to himself and others that he was expelled from a group. I have read ""A new slant on life"" and ""Fundamentals of thought"" in order to get a better idea of what Hubbard and Scientology is all about. That makes a lot more sense to me and I can recommend others to do the same if they want to get a better understanding. These books have helped me a lot!"
1,This is not based on any sort of true information,"My experience with this book is that it is not based on any sort of factual information regarding L. Ron Hubbard or Dianetics or any other subjects that he has been involved with. It is purely someone's opinion and should only be taken with a grain of salt. If you want to know the true information, read ""What is Scientology?"""
4,Pop Music Icons Spout the Truth in Varying Degrees,"There are essentially three categories of interviewees here:1. Those that are a bit too guarded, polite, and circumspect (e.g., Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger).2. Those that let it all hang out (e.g., Keith Richards, Joan Baez, Bo Diddley).3. Those that are somewhere between the two extremes mentioned above (e.g., Bruce Springsteen, Woody Allen, Tip O'Neill, Clint Eastwood).All in all, most everyone that falls into the second two categories are quite entertaining, if not occasionally revelatory. Out of 34 interviews, there are only a small handful of klunkers (e.g., McCartney and Jagger).An above average read."
2,Worked fine for exactly 1 year.,Ordered on Amazon. Best price. Guaranteed for 1 year. Worked fine for exactly 1 year. Just stopped heating up. Will not return to manufacturer. Will buy another brand locally so that I can return to store if not satisfied.
3,Meh.,Really liked it. But the switch gave out and it would cycle. Meaning that the switch wouldn't click off when the water reached boiling - but the thermostat would cut the power. So it would heat to boil then stop... Then heat to boil then stop... Cycling until the kettle ran dry. Not a real good combination of events if you happen to have a dwelling made of (or containing) something flammable.Maybe this is the perfect gift for folks living in a cinder block house with concrete counters and metal furniture.Good when it's working. Frightful if not.
2,quality marginal,Have had this model since the end of October 2010 and the latch on the lid no longer functions to keep it closed. Still heats well enough however I won't buy THIS MODEL again. Looking for a model with a different style lid now.
3,2 negative parts,"It looks like the image exactly but :1- Part of the heating element (vertical by the handle)is shown, which was not mentioned in the description or specifications.2- Opening is wider than I expected.But on the overall is a good product."
3,Heats fast but leaks when pouring.,I was initially very happy with this item. It heats quickly and is solidly built.As I got to know the item better I've decided to replace it.#1) It does get very hot. You have to be careful to only touch the handle.#2) It leaks when you're pouring. This seems like the mode basic thing you'd look for when designing such an item. There's a dribble of near boiling water down the front of the kettle as your pouring. This means hot water all over the counter. No good. Heaven forbid you're heating broth in it.When I replace it I will purchase something else.
2,Leaky,"This worked very well until it started to corrode and leak, about a year after I bought it for daily use."
5,Nice design & great function,"In replacing our stovetop kettle with an electric one, I was looking for one to match the stainless steel & black appliances in our kitchen, and this one is great. This heats water much faster than the stovetop or microwave, and is pretty quiet in the process; the sides get a little hot during the heating, but the bottom stays cool enough to move straight to the table (sans trivet!) I don't know if the ""scale screen"" included will help any, but otherwise I think this a great purchase!"
4,Works as advertised!!!,"First electric tea kettle bought. Even though I have it only for a month now, I find this one to be extremely efficient and convenient... I was concerned about the metal sides getting hot, but the handle always stays cool and should not be a problem for 'responsible' adults to handle."
4,cordeless tea kettle,It serves the purpose and works well for the money.However it is not easy to clean inside.It works fast. I like auto switch off when it's done.
3,Wonderful the first couple of years,"When I first got this for my wife and I we thought it was fantastic and used it for evening tea and heating water for iced tea. I must admit that for 2+ years it worked great. Lately this has changed and the pot is leaking between the seams and if we forget about it (with water inside) later we can count on finding water on the counter top where it resides. If this is supposed to only last 2-3 years, it's great, longer than that a person should plan on replacing it.Pluses:1) Heats water very fast and efficiently2) Nice looking design3) Easy to pour fromNegatives:1) Hot exterior2) Began to leak with age"
4,Great addition to corporate kitchen,"We bought this for a corporate office kitchen. It looks very attractive and fits well with our other appliances - classy styling. This is a handy pot and the only drawback is that it takes a little longer than I thought it would to heat water, but overall, a great addition to our kitchen."
2,Great Design BUT...,"I thought the kettle was very easy to use and was nicely designed. However, I could not get rid of the stale odor (after washing and scrubbing it a number of times) and therefore, had to return it."
2,Waiting to use this item....,"I was delighted when I received this item, but when I was doing the initial recommended ""clean up before use"", I discovered on the bottom that it was ""Made in China."" I called the manufacturer to find out if these teakettles have been tested for lead content, but did not get a satisfactory answer. SO, I have ordered a ""lead tester"" kit (from Amazon) .... when my kit arrives, I will test this appliance for lead content. If it proves to be free from lead, I look forward to using it. (Had the catalog listing indicated that the appliance is Made in China, I would have looked for one made elsewhere.)Chef's Choice 685 International Deluxe Cordless Electric Teakettle"
1,Unsatisfactory,The electric pot is not easy to clean as the lid does not come off therefore there is only a small opening to reach in to dry out this pot after use.Because of the above condition we have a mold mildew that we are unable to stop from returning. After I scour the area in the bottom of the pot and have gotten rid of all residue after the 2nd or 3rd heat cycle the mold is back.
3,OK hot pot,"This hot pot is OK. It doesn't heat water as quickly as some other kettles I've had, though, so I would shell out a little more money for something more powerful. The stainless steel interior is nice."
2,Good While it Lasted,"I am a tea-a-holic. This was a great way to avoid the tea kettle on the stove or watching a pot boil, plus, this item is small enough to take with you; I used it at my parent's house and in a hotel. My problem, however, is that it just quit working; I had the unit less than 3 months. All contacts were clean and the light indicator would come on, but, the kettle wouldn't heat. WHile I say I drink a lot of tea, the unit was only getting used in the morning for my first cup and then occasionally at night for another cup."
2,Stops working in 6 months,"While I liked the tea kettle, I was disappointed that it stopped working in less than six months. Amazon provided a partial refund since the appliance included a one-year warranty."
1,Stopped working,"This was a perfectly acceptable unit until it quit heating one morning just after the one year warranty was up. According to the service center, it would cost me more for shipping and repairs than to buy a new one. Hate to see things just go in the dump. I will replace, but not with a Chef's Choice product."
2,Chef's Choice Is Not My Choice,"I'm now starting my third quest to find a well made,long lasting electric kettle. I've had 2 of the Chef's Choice 677. Figured the 1st one was a fluke as it barely lasted a year. I did not purchase it on Amazon. The spout drips as you pour and scale does collect around the bottom. I'm going to spend a bit more time researching and hope to come up with the best cup of tea around yet! I think Krups is going to be the winner."
4,Top Tea Kettle,This is an excellent product. It is convenient efficient and easy to use. I particularly like that it automatically shuts off when it reaches the boiling point.
4,"Fast, but quiet","This is the first electric kettle I've ever owned, so I don't have previous experience with these things. This product is well-designed, boils the water really fast and turns itself off when the water boils. Only drawback to me is the absence of the ""whistle."""
1,Good while it lasted...,"The kettle was good while it lasted in that it boiled water quickly and reliably. I didn't notice any silicon taste to the water that others have reported, but then again, I'm not very sensitive about those issues.The problem is that one and a half years after purchasing this device, small bits of the black plastic that the trim is made of started breaking off of the interior and falling into the water. I have no idea how many pieces of this plastic I had ingested before I noticed a particularly large one: 1/8"" square.It is out of warranty so I have to buy a new one and it certainly wont be Chef's Choice (the brand) or anything else made by EdgeCraft (the actual manufacturer)."
1,Got a dud,"Defective right out of the box, would not heat up at all. Now have to spend 20 bucks returning this thing."
2,No staying power,I loved this kettle for 13 months. Just one month longer than the warranty. Now it lights up and nothing. No heat. I thought one of the advantages of an electric kettle would be that I wouldn't have to replace it every year.
1,Expensive Garbage,"I had initially reviewed this kettle after I bought it and gave it 4 stars because it worked. After about a year of use the switch died. It doesn't turn itself off after the water boils making it a worthless bit of trash. It's unfortunate that a company can charge nearly $50 dollars for a tea kettle that dies after a ridiculously short amount of time. Don't waste your money on this kettle. There are cheaper ones out there that do the same and work and don't become land fill sooner than it should. If this is an indication of the quality this company puts put, stay away from anything called Chef's Choice."
3,Boils Quick !,"This is a nice little kettle. It does boil water very fast, but I was dissapointed with the spout - it's awkward to get water in it ! Not a reason not to buy it though ! Good for the price."
2,Keeps turning itself back on.,"We've used this kettle for at least six years now. I guess that's a testament to how sturdily it's made. However, as many others have noted, this kettle occasionally turns itself back on! This is a rare occurrence, but it's nerve wracking when it happens. We've never found out what happens if we were to leave the kettle plugged in when it happens since we _always_ unplug it when not in use. I've never been able to get the lid release switch to work quite right. I fiddle with it every time (but my wife says she has no issues with it). The kettle has finally started rusting around the edges and the filter insert has disintegrated. We're looking for a new kettle, but it won't be this one."
1,Two Failures,"I have owned two Chef's Choice Teakettles, one for home, and one for a summer cottage. Both failed miserably. The first one developed a leak at the plastic switch, so I replaced it with a Breville model, and am completely satisfied. Yesterday, on my second Chef's Choice kettle, the plastic (very cheap!) lever suddenly stopped working. After removing the bottom of the kettle, I discovered that the plastic lever had snapped in half. (Two seniors carefully using both of them!) I ordered a new Breville two days ago, and it was delivered today. How could Chef's Choice make such a beautiful stainless steel teakettle, then add such a cheap plastic lever? I loved the Chef's Choice, but would never again buy one of their products. If you want quality, buy a Breville product!"
2,Low quality kettle,"I have long been a big fan of electric kettles. I recently decided to upgrade from a plastic Braun model when I become concerned about the plastic leaking into the water. I bought the Chef's Choice and knew I had made a mistake as soon as I unpacked it. It just feels, looks and operates like a cheap appliance--the on/off switch is flimsy plastic, the metal is thin, it just seems like piece of junk. I hope to return it and in the interim bought a Breville model that seems much better."
2,Sad but true!,"I was so sad to see that the reviews that I read were very true. I liked the style of the kettle, so I threw the reviews to the wind and got it anyways. Mine didn't even work for 6 weeks and it started to not shut off consistently. One day it does, one day it doesn't. You can't trust a kettle that way. We still use it because I spent a lot on it and I can't find a pot that I like the shape of better but now we have to stand and wait for it to boil or constantly check back. And by the way it boils VERY slow. All in all I can't possibly give it a good review."
2,The lid falls off after about 3 months,"I bought this kettle. Love it EXCEPT, the lid is attached to the kettle with plastic so the heat from boiling/steam finally broke the attachments on each side of the lid. So, no when i pour the lid falls into my cup if I am not careful. also, very hard to clean."
2,Lever Broke and Interior RUSTED after 2.5 Years,"Fairly attractive unit with convenient on/off switch, heats quickly. I've had this over two years and used daily.CONS: The inside has started to RUST (so I'm throwing it out). As other reviewers noted, the mechanism for opening the lid is somewhat flimsy. The mechanism on mine BROKE after 1.5 years, so I had to manually open to add water and hold lid when pouring (not good as lid gets hot!)There is also pitting around the top (I've only used water in this unit).The interior rusting is a health issue. Who knows how long it was rusting before I saw the rust-- terrible!!"
2,Major con: blisteringly hot,"A major con is that insulation is insufficient. The metal exterior is blisteringly hot. (I have had similar kettles made of plastic before - they also are hot to the touch when water is heated, but not so hot that you can almost blister your skin if you accidentally touch it - like touching a metal pan right on the stove). It is a pity, because otherwise the design is very nice. (I returned my kettle because I couldn't live with this problem)."
5,gave for a gift,"I own a tea kettle like this but it was no longer available. After visiting friends in Nevada I decided to send this tea kettle as a gift, sight unseen, bought only from other reviews. Was nervous about it. The recipients I know well enough that if it was a piece of junk they would let me know. They raved about it, thought the design attractive and it was fast to heat water and all the features worked to their satisfaction."
3,Lots of pros; just one con,"Overall, this is a neat little kettle. Water boils super fast, very clean interior (no elements to deal with), very quiet operation. Very nice kettle. The only con (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars) is that it's not insulated, and the outside gets VERY hot (and stays hot for a long time). Would recommend it as long as you don't have young children around."
4,does the job well but small problem,I am the all time electric teakettle user. I had a good quality plastic (inside and out) tea kettle that did an excellent job. I learned about the health drawbacks of using plastic for heating water and started looking for a metal alternative. The Chef's Choice pot seemed to present this for me. The pot heats quickly and holds a large amount of water. I am very pleased with its performance. My only complaint is that it is not insulated and the exterior surface of the pot gets very hot to the touch. I would strongly recommend that it be insulated.
4,Useful product,The product works well but it is a little heavy and bulky. The only criticism is I can not easily see the level of water in the pot I use it every day.
2,One Drip Short,"The Chef's Choice Cordless Kettle looks good and works fine, heating water quickly. However, when pouring, it tends to drip, either from water droplets accumulated around the lid's edge or from the spout. A bit pricey, all things considered."
4,"Good, but not the best","My parents own this kettle and I own the Braun WK200W Electric Water Kettle. This kettle is good quality and effective, but the Braun is superior. The Braun heats the water more quickly, has a water viewer on both sides of the handle, and has better pouring control. That being said, this Chef's Choice is almost as good, it is just harder to see the water level and it is more heavy and less convenient to hold. I would recommend looking at the Braun before deciding to buy this one."
4,does the job,"It works. It does what I bought if for. One small issue - filling from the top is a bit awkward, since top cover opening is narrow."
5,Good desigh and high quality.,I dropped my previous kettle and busted the handle...it was another model by same outfit. I am very satisfied by this firms products.
3,So-so,"This kettle heats water quickly and is comfortably balanced. However, the lid design is poor. The button that releases the lid is spongy. You sometimes have to press it 2 or 3 times, and then it doesn't always release; so you have to get under the edge of the lid and urge it up. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this kettle."
2,Switch broke after 11 months usage,"When 3/4 full of water, this is a heavy pot but that wasn't such a problem. It worked well but after 11 months, the switch broke. $50 is a lot of $ for one year's service."
5,"I love this ""teapot""","My roommate had this exact pot, and I couldn't live without it when he moved out. Best price I could find on the internet ($38) with no shipping and no tax was great compared to 69 plus tax in the store!"
1,I loved my first one ... this is the second -,"And there won't be a third!!!I had my first tea kettle for three years and LOVED it. When I misplaced it during a move I reordered the identical kettle for all the same reasons. It was efficient, I liked the design, it was silent, the price was right etc. etc. I LOVED it.I purchased my second one in August; now it's October and the kettle produces a shrieking high pitched whine. Given the ease of the mechanics it can ONLY be the kettle itself. I cleaned the filter etc. etc. but no go. It's like listening to nails on a chalkboard and even my cat runs from the room in horror when it's on. Of course, it's past the time when I can return this piece of junk so I'm just out the money AND have gone through the hassle of purchasing one, waiting for it to ship etc.Don't risk it."
5,All that I can ask for.,I bought this to boil water for a French press coffee maker. I haven't timed how long it takes to come to a boil but it is quick enough for me.
2,Top fell off after 3.5 years,We have used our kettle daily for 3.5 years which is pretty rigorous use but I would prefer it if small appliances weren't disposable. When the top stopped flipping up it was only a week before it fell off altogether. I'm going to try a Russell Hobbs kettle next time around.
2,Good while it lasted...,"This kettle is great for atleast a year. If you use it as much as I do (boiling water at least twice to three times a day), then you can be assured that the hinge at the lid will break, which causes the lid to not close which causes the kettle to happily keep boiling away because the automatic shut-off relies on the lid being closed completely, the partially broken hinge gives you false assurance that the lid is closed, but not close enough.. ! This is after a year and a half of use. Whereas my husbands old screw cap kettle works a charm even after 8 years of use.The good thing about this is that you can remove it from the base and it works like a cordless kettle.I will probably not buy this product again.FAIL on - Automatic shut-off, boil-dry safety protection, and secure locking lid"
2,Disappointing - Cheap construction,"I bought the Chef's Choice for its size and speed at heating water - which the product does do. What I did not expect was the handle to detach from the base of the unit - creating a job for Gorilla glue - which did not work either. So, each time we pick up the unit (as in the picture) the handle separates from the unit creating moments of anticipation - wondering when it will come apart once and for all.This is my second Chef's Choice water boiler, and my last. The first unit (entirely different model but still Chef's Choice) worked wonderfully for a year. Due to design flaws, the boiler works when it wants - not when I need it."
5,I feel like a German and love it!,"After living in Germany for a year, I came home and felt a big loss. Having never seen a water cooker like this in the states I was saddened, but accepted it as ""American living"".. Christmas came and BOOM this was the best present ever, it turns off when hitting the boiling point, is quiet and boils water so much faster than on the stove. I love this kettle and can't say enough great things about it!"
4,so far so good!,"I've only had my Chefs choice kettle for a few weeks, but it works great so far! I really like that the majority of the kettle is metal and not plastic. It swivels nicely, so you can aim the spout in whatever direction you want (so you're not constantly steaming the underside of cabinets etc.)"
1,It's going back to the store.,"Thanks to another reviewer, I took a good look inside this kettle and yep, there are silicone (?) seals inside the thing. If I'm boiling water--which I do, constantly, as I'm a tea addict--I don't want eau de silicone as an end result. Whichever nasty chemicals make up silicone, I'm pretty sure I don't want to drink them.So it's going back to the store. Shame on Chef's Choice for making a shoddy product."
4,love it,Works great. Hard to reach inside the pot to clean or dry. The fill level is a little difficult to see. Pour spout screen is a little difficult.
3,Good concept - Unreliable,"Worked great on first usuage. By the 4th time I used the unit, it would boil for a minute past boiling, spewing steam and water out of the pot. Yes the metal pot does get hot, but I like the stainless steel. I am reordering a replacement unit due to the strong recommendations of other owners. I was very disappointed that Target was unable to handle my return."
1,expired cordless kettle,"Great while it lasted. I guess we are to expect this in our disposible society, but in my 74 years I've seen the days when you expected and got quality merchandise. One year is to short a life span."
4,"Excellent Capacity, Stainless Kettle, but...","This is a well made, large capacity stainless steel electric kettle that is slightly short on styling and would probably be a better fit in an office environment as opposed to a trend setting kitchen, although most of us would hardly care. It tends to over-boil the water, and I find myself flipping the kettle off before it does so automatically. That's a minor criticism of an obviously well crafted kettle that appears to be dependable and ready for a number of years of faithful service. I would recommend this as a very good buy."
4,Nice,"A great book, keeps u spellbound the whole time. A true cover to cover read, this book makes u love all the time you spent on it."
4,Good easy read,Easy read - part of a series and have read most. Good book to take your mind off work. Abby makes a good female lead
4,Shadow-y book,"Wasn't a bad book, wasn't the best book. Definitely a psychological book. I read the book, honestly I did. But when I started to write a review, I had to go back to the book to even remember what it was about. It obviously didn't make a huge impression on me. It had more than a few twists and turns, who I thought was going to be the ""evil, bad"" person wasn't who it turned out to be, but the really ""evil, bad"" person really was evil and bad, assisted by an unexpected person.Characters were fully developed, mostly. Plot line was okay, it just wasn't memorable (to me.) I like Michael Prescott and that's why I bought the book. I'm still rating the book 4 stars."
2,The Shadow Hunter,I have read many of his books but this one was a little disappointing.It didn't seem to get in with it.
1,Voulger,I believe writtings can be without using Jesus Christ and or Gods name in vain!I didn't even go past the prelude. So I hate to think how many times this existed throughout the book.
3,She Wasn't In The Shadows For Long,"The Shadow Hunter looked interesting to me because I always like a good psychological thriller. I have rated it just ""ok"" because while it did keep me entertained, it was not quite what I expected. I thought there would be much more of a ""cat and mouse"" game between the main character and the psycho she was investigating before her cover was blown. As it was, there was someone who informed the psycho very quickly that she was spying on him. I also thought the ending was a little weak. The psycho's ""informant"" turns out to be quite a surprise, but I never totally bought the informant's motivation to help out the psycho!"
2,Predictable Outcome,I would not have read this book if I had known more about the story. Very predictable ending.to a very average plot
3,A little over the top,"I'm probably a little critical by giving it an average rating, but I've read too many really good books lately, and this one just didn't make the 4/5 star cut."
5,Hide and Seek turned deadly,"Abby Sinclair works for a security company hired to protect high profile news anchor Kris Barwood who's being stalked. Raymond Hickle, the paranoid loser of a stalker, is a known quantity, but there is much more going on than meets the eye. Abby's renting the apartment next to Hickle's is dangerous enough, but there is more danger coming at her than she can imagine. As Abby hunts Hickle, she never dreams that she herself is prey until it's almost too late. The unexpected twists and turns are ingenious and turn this into a real nail-biter of a page-turner."
5,Fast moving fun!,I wouldn't mind reading more of this lady's adventures. The book is very fast paced and hard to put down.
5,Great Read,I have recently discovered Michael Prescott as an author. This is the second of his books that I've read. It kept my interest and kept me guessing until the end. Well written.
4,Good read,I am only half way thru this and it is well written..there are a few ways this may turn out
4,Suspenseful,It drew me in throughout the whole book. It had lots of twists and turns...some good characters. Over all. I would recommend this book.
4,The Shadow Hunter,I liked that it was a fast paced read with some unexpected twists and turns. The Shadow Hunter made me want to read the next book in this series.
4,very surprised,Book kept you turning pages. Very suspenseful and keeps you guessing about who is the mystery man. Abby fights her way through another thriller.
3,Graves & Shadows,"Michael Prescott's Shadow Hunter and Graves of Angels plots are a bit too similar for my taste. Granted, Prescott is republishing on ebooks stuff from former noms de plume. Nonetheless, Michael Prescott, IMHO, is a pretty bloody good author in this genre, and I'll look forward his further pubs."
4,What's that in the shadows?...,"A stalker of a TV news anchor emerges from the shadows. Abby Sinclair, who pursues stalkers, must intercede before the kill. A gripping thriller, the suspense-driven plot and well-developed characters make this a true novel of terror."
5,The Shadow Hunter,"Michael Prescott is one of the best suspense writers to come along in many years. He is a wordsmith with an incredible sense of pace and a unique understanding for the female viewpoint. ""The Shadow Hunter"" is fast-paced from beginning to end, a book that is really hard to put down."
3,A good twist,"Interesting story with a likeable protagonist and unexpected twist. I thought the ending was a little contrived, but overall enjoyed the story, especially after the tempo picked up in the second half of the book."
3,Not best,Good book ...not his best . Mr. Prescott is a good writer and would recommend this book only at Kindle prices.
4,Unexpected twist,"The Shadow Hunter is a fast paced story where a person with a paranoid personality complex is exploited and manipulated into dark, obsessive thoughts about revenge. It is hard not to want to keep reading. The 'stalker/hunter' is a complex character with her own unresolved issues who sets out to prove that she if proficient at her profession. This puts her in grave personal danger. It is definitely a good read."
4,Thank you,"Well written I did get lost a couple of times trying to keep up with the changes, glad I read it."
2,Predictable,"This novel was fair. The premise, of a person with psychological training who befriends potential stalkers to discern their violence levels, is really interesting. However, all the characters, including the protagonist, were shallow, not believable. The plotting and dialog was TV-movie fare and I knew the true ""hidden"" villian before the book really got started."
5,Prescott is a Magician,"I only say that because he is the Master of Mis-Direction. He'll have you thinking that the story is going in one direction but suddenly, he takes you somewhere totally different. For example, he will develop a character and describe all of his or her great attributes but may mention one negative. However,that one negative might turn out to be the turning point of the novel.This book is packed with excitement from beginning to end. If you are a fan of mystery and suspense, you won't be disappointed."
5,Great Read,This was an awesome book - I could not put this book down - it is a novel and I almost gave it 4 stars as I like non-fiction but this book kept me reading it so fast it told me it was a fabulous book to read. You will enjoy this.
4,A page turner.,I didn't suspect the real villain until the story disclosed it. That made it interesting. I didn't quite buy that he would want to kill her because she failed her previous assignment. He had other options.
4,Good but a bit predictable,I enjoyed the book but found the end a bit predictable... doesn't take away from the quality of the read. It was a page turner and kept me engaged right to the end.
4,"Quick, good read","This book kept my interest and I finished it quickly. It moved along at a good pace, and I LOVE when there's a twist I hadn't anticipated!"
3,"Nuts, but nice.","This is a well-written book about a protagonist who likes to stay detached, except for when it is bad for her. It has a nice surprise ending, and you should enjoy it."
4,Shadow Hunter,A good mystery yarn that keeps building the suspense until resolution. Abby is not afraid to walk on the dark side demonstrating her philosophy that the ends justify the means.
5,The Shadow Hunter,"I really loved this book, it was hard to put down. I look forward to reading more books from Michael Prescott"
4,The Shadow Hunter,"Extremely interesting. So many twists and turns it really keeps you up all night. Just when you think you know what is going to happen next, Michael Prescott flips everything around. Excellent book."
5,Edible gold flakes,"I was very happy with the promptness of delivery, within two days. It was well packaged. I sprinkled it on a chocolate ganache torte and into four champagne cocktails and still have plenty to do the same at least four times more. Everyone was delighted at how special the dinner became with that little touch."
2,This is a VERY small amount of gold flake!,"Product is fine, but an extremely small amount is in this product of edible gold flake shaker. Need 3 more words???"
3,Just okay...,"I had another Vidal Sassoon travel hair dryer that was awesome and it died. So, I purchased this one. Even though my other one was also 1875W, it seemed to dry my thick long hair twice as fast. This is a okay little dryer, but I think I will try to locate the same one I had before."
5,Great little dryer,"I purchased this to keep at the cottage to use when I am there. I have had it for a year and it does what I want it to. I wanted something small to not take up too much room, but reliable so I could dry my hair if I wanted to. The price was right, it's powerful enough for its size, and it folds up nicely when I'm not using it. very happy."
1,From the bad old days of VHS,"This video looks like it was made about 1983, yet the release date is 2009. The old footage is understandably grainy, but the cheesygraphics and tickertape seizure-inducing text along the bottom, look like something a high school kid would have thought upback in the 80s when computers first became standard in schools. Not only that, it looks like it was made by a high schoolkid, in the 80s, who had also discovered mind-altering substances. I do not recommend this video in any way, shapeor form. If you get it for free, then the price would be right. If you can find someone to pay you to take it off theirhands, that would be even better."
4,Encyclopedia?,Good book but not really in encyclopedia format. I was expecting something searchable with a photograph and article about each breed. This is more of a cover to cover read than a reference encyclopedia. The information is good and the photos there are good just not what I expected as per the title.
1,Get everything on the internet,"Don't pay for a book on resumes. Google it. There are many good websites out there on writing resumes and writing...in general. Not specialists in resume-writing, but a bunch of editors out to make a quick buck so buy my online writing class to learn to write. I make a full-time living as a freelance writer and writing teacher."
4,Nativity shepherd with sheep.,The figurine is very pretty however I thought it would be larger in size. I am still glad I added it to our nativity scene.
3,American Horticultural Society Practical Guides: Roses,"Very basic information with photos. OK for a novice, too vague if you have ever grown roses. The book seems aimed at novices in in a zone 6 or 7 growing climate."
1,Don't download this,"This item is just a fraction of the real book. It appears to be presented for free only to promote the paper copy, which you have to buy if you want to read the book. Don't even bother downloading this, it's not worth it at all in my opinion."
2,A course in woodturning,Quite an old-fashioned and basic account of wood turning. The major problem is that the illustrations are not available which limits the value of the text.
4,Could have been 5 stars...,"This was an excellent story, very well told. Very touching ending, as well. This movie could have been 5 stars, were it made without foul language. Not only was it unnecessary, it in fact detracted from the story itself. it was forced into the script. Other than that, beautiful story, well made."
5,What Memorial Day is really about,"This movie was an amazing tribute to our veterans past and present. To those who are now or have served, it showed the importance of being able to talk about the horrible experiences they went through, and to those who haven't, it provided some understanding and compassion to listen to and reach out to our veterans. Though it may not be appropriate for very young viewers, it is a compassionate family story that should stir the emotions and provide for meaningful discussion. It was a professional production, an excellent movie all around!"
2,Not really very good,"I honor the ""greatest generation"" and what they gave us through their sacrifice. But this movie is maudlin tripe. Notice I am not attacking those who fight for the rest of us. I am attacking this crummy movie."
2,Simply not a good movie.,Simply not a good movie. I stopped watching after 45 minutes and I was just killing time and it was playing in the background.
3,It was ok,It was only ok. A good story with bad acting. Reminded me of one of those Kirk Cameron religous movies.
2,usmc03,"Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but 20 mins into this movie and I was bored. Seemed more like a chick drama than a war film."
2,MEMORIAL DAY,Expected more but certainly did'nt get it. Could only watch abouttwenty minutes of this movie and got so bored I had to shut it off.Aside from Cromwell Sr. the rest of the acting was dull andpredictable. Even the little kid. I just could'nt take any more. Sorry.
1,Slow Moving Movie,"I did not like this movie, but my wife and son thought it was okay. The previews made it appear there was going to be much more action, but instead it was (to me) a slow moving story-telling Lifetime movie."
5,"Wow, great film - well done","Terrific story and well told, definitely worth a watch, its rare that a film gets so many 5's attributed to it, but there is a reason for that!"
5,A great film powerful and moving,"I am not a big fan of war movies, but this film is exceptional. I was privileged to be able to attend a screening and I was very impressed. The film is of the highest quality and remains real while may of today's movies are full of digital enhancements. The film was shot completely in Minnesota, the snow is real snow, the planes are real planes, and the message is really moving. My grandfather never told his stories, I don't know how he got his purple heart or his bronze star. I hope that the people that see this movie are moved to tell the stories of their experiences, not just in war but in life. When we learn from our past we are welcoming a better future. This film may just move you to share that story and create a better future for your family. Yes it was that powerful. Buy it and watch it with those that are close to you."
5,Memorial Day,"If you're a Vet...or not.... a grandfather, son, brother...or not...a wife, daughter, sister...or not...friend or foe....all must see this film! I was privileged to see it today. Still weak in the knees and overwhelmed! Check it out! You won't be disappointed....I promise!"
4,Well done!,"For those who are patriotic, those who have great respect for service members and their families, or for those who have forgotten about the value of our Grandparents' experiences, I highly recommend this movie."
5,A superb movie for thinking & feeling adults,"Saw this movie tonight while scrolling through the offerings on Amazon Prime. Sounded interesting so we watched it. This is an excellent movie about how real people experience war. The actors and actresses in this movie remind me of real people that any mid-western or small town America resident would know. The heartfelt emotions expressed throughout the movie brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. This is not an ""action movie"" so if that's what you are looking for keep moving. This is a movie for mature, thinking, feeling individuals of all ages. Don't judge this movie for wartime special effects, or how well the actors spoke German. If that is what you want you are missing the point. Judge this movie about how the characters make you feel as the story progresses and concludes. My thanks to all who participated in this well crafted story."
5,Awesome!,"This is a GOT TO SEE! It you like a good story line with great war action, add this to your library!"
4,good for the budget,"I'm a little partial, having grown up about 20 minutes from the filming location and being a Red Bull allum, but it was a really good story. A little slow at times and a few of the peripheral actors were not the best, but good where and when it counted. Amazing they did it for a budget of only 1 million. Definately worth watching."
5,Good Movie,Watched this again last night. The story of Sgt Vogel is a little sketchy. The Story of young Vogel with his grandfather and his recollections are well worth waiting through the slow portions.
5,Fantastic,This is a wonderful book. Norman Rockwell is truly an exceptional artist. I LOVE this book!
4,A Good Read,"Not in the same league as 'The Life of Adam Smith' by Ross, it is still a very easy and good read about the life and times of the incomparable Adam Smith. Some of the chapters seem very brief, especially those that deal with his two great works: 'Wealth of Nations' and 'Theory of Moral Sentiments.'Well worth the buy!"
1,sketchy concept overview w/ many wrong answers.......,"I grabbed this book from my local library to do some brushing up on some old high school concepts before reviewing some more serious calculus. There is very little intuitive development for what ""may"" be intended as prep material for standardized tests such as the ACT or GRE. For example, the proofs for geometrical volumes or surface areas are laughable at best,if existent at all. As an electrical engineer, I feel very confident in the answers I obtained...especially after double checking my own scratch work. I am seriously considering writing my own book based on the material that was thrown into this one....."
1,Stay Away From This Book!!!!!!,"This book is HORRIBLE! Almost 70% of the answers provided in the back of each chapter for checking your work are wrong. I have even checked the book's wrong answers through an independent tutor who confirmed that the book's answers were wrong in almost all instances. Unfortunately, the chapters with the most errors are the ones covering the more difficult subjects! This book will have you doubting your ability to do math in a matter of chapters. Stay away!!!!!"
3,It's OK,"Got this as a gift with the Chef's Choice waffle maker, the waffel maker is awesome!! The best out there, but this waffle mix is just so so."
4,Work great!,"If your child won't swallow medicine, then these are a great alternative. The package is harder to open than FeverAll but so much cheaper."
1,Charon's Cosmology,"I just need to know what people's impressions of ""Charon's Cosmology"" were....thanks!"
4,Cork Board,"A fun, flowery cork board. It did get slightly damaged through the mail so a little better packaging of the product would help."
2,Hope It Will Look Better Framed,"The quality of this print is not very high. It looks like someone just printed it out on photo paper. The actual image is very pretty but the colors looked washed. I suspect from the method of printing, or the paper used, or the ink quality or some combination of those things. The size also needs to be trimmed to fit a standard frame. I am hoping it will look better when it's framed and hanged..."
5,Great product,This is very easy to use and reliable. We have had no problems with it. I can't rate the battery life because it is rather new.
4,Great for Power Point,"Excellent for use with Power Point presentations, but not useful with other software.I love a product that works out of the box without a lot of fuss; this wireless pointer was true plug-an-play. The controls are simple and easy to use with PPT; however, be aware this is a ""one program"" only device: the navigation buttons and even the laser pointer confuse other programs which make it unusable for anything but PPT."
5,Kensington Presenter,"I absolutely love this product. It is available with or without a laser pointer. I recommend the latter, making it a very complete tool for all presenters. You can simply hold it in your hand or keep it in a pocket out of sight while using it. The audience is not even aware how the slides are advancing. You also have the ability to reverse and or go to a black screen. Once used, you will never present again without it. PS: The best part, the usb stick is stored within the presenter itself, so it is always available. I do suggest that you put your name on the stick and the presenter, so that if if you forget to remove the usb stick from the computer, yes I have done that, someone will know who it belongs to. The usb stick and the presenter are married, they only work with the original. IF you lose your stick, there is no replacement available."
5,Good remote,I bought this for use in college when I do presentations. It worked without installing any new software (other than Microsoft Powerpoint) and the usb wireless adapter fit into the back end of the remote so it doesn't get lost - smart design! Slide changing seemed to be quick no matter how far away from the computer you may be.
4,good gadget,So far so good!! It's so much easier to give a talk and not be attach to my laptopThe back-for mech has been working great
4,Can't live without it,"How did I get along without this before? My only complaint is that using the laser pointer when I am not in PowerPoint somehow causes a mouse click, which may not be what I wanted. Still, it's easy enough to get a second laser pointer these days."
5,Good Choice,"I am very pleased with this purchase . . . it all stores neatly within itself and functions flawlessly. I carry it with me anytime a presentation is probably and it's a wonderful tool that met everything I required, i.e., functionality, easy to use and laser pointer."
4,Works well on PCs and Macs,"My husband and I both teach large lectures at a university. This slide advancer works consistently with both of our laptops and with the university computers in the lecture halls. The remote's ability to communicate with my computer gets a little spotty when I'm at the back of the 300-person lecture hall, but it's very reliable closer to the front. My husband's lecture hall is smaller (150 students), and he's never had a problem with the range."
4,"Very pleased, but wish it were smaller.","Length:: 1:44 MinsThis is my video review of the Kensington 33374 Wireless Presenter with Laser Pointer. I'm very pleased with it overall, giving it only a slight deduction due to the size."
2,"Great, if you are using PowerPoint.","A potentially great tool except, as pointed out by other reviewers, it only works with PowerPoint! Not that you could discern this from Kensington literature. Want to use it with any of the billion other presentation or photo slide show applications out there? Too bad; it is simple and has great range.I asked Kensington tech support about this issue who said it wasn't possible to remap the buttons. I then suggested maybe someone could spend 30 minutes writing a preference pane like MouseWorks to allow remapping the buttons. They suggested I write the company and suggest this. Thought I just did."
3,great tool with amazing flaw,just 4 buttons and works like a magic - but one great flaw - if the PPT is in non-presentation mode then if you hit the laser button then it goes to presentation model and takes you to the first slide. great design and easy to hold - after 7 hours also you will love to hold it except for that one flaw
2,Half works,"This remote and laser pointer only half works. The remote features are great. The laser pointer, however, causes the presentation to disappear from the display. It's therefore completely useless as a pointer unless you want to point to something off the screen."
3,Lasted about a year...,"I bought this item because it seemed more durable than the other clickers. After about a year of regular use (almost daily - I am a teacher), it stopped working. This is pretty much in line with what I experienced with other, more inexpensive, models... FYI."
3,"Good, not perfect","The presenter feels nice in my hand and the forward and backward controls work great. The built-in laser works well also. My favorite feature is the USB port that stores inside the unit and acts as an on/off switch. No accidentally leaving the unit on and running down the batteries! My only real problem is that the ""blank screen"" button does not work. Don't know why. Also, I wish it had a built-in mouse so that I could navigate around my screen, play videos, etc."
1,BEWARE!! VERY LIMITED USE!!,"I bought this clicker hoping to use it with my Mac to go through a PowerPoint presentation at a big conference. Plugged in the USB attachment and...it would not recognize my Macbook Pro. So then I called the company and found out that this particular Kensington presenter only works with PowerPoint on a PC or Keynote on a Mac. So if you're me trying to use it with PowerPoint on a Mac, then you're totally out of luck. Was there any mention of this on the Amazon website? No. Am I angry and frustrated? Yes...VERY!!!"
2,One major fault....,"NOTE: The device is only for advancing and reversing slides. IT HAS NO CAPACITY TO WORK WITHIN THE SLIDE. Therefore, if you have inserted a video or need to activate elements within the slide, it will not work. It has no capacity to address elements within the slide. For Powerpoint with elements like music, video or moving charts...it won't work. It will only advance the slide. Wish some reviewers had noted that in their reviews!"
4,Great device,I use this device for photography club presentations. It works great with my MacBook Pro and Adobe Bridge slideshows. We pass the handheld unit around as each photographer narrates his/her own presentation. it's plug and play on my Mac and has excellent range in the large room that we use for meetings. It's pretty self-evident as to how to operate...even the beginners knew what to do by just looking at the thing.I haven't used it with Keynote yet so can't speak to that use.I did try it with Adobe Lightroom and it did not work in that software. That's why only 4 stars from me.Recommended
5,Great purchase!,"I love it! The presenter is easy to use, comfortable to carry around during class and works like a charm. No longer am I chained to the podium to change the slides during class. Price was definitely the best I've seen."
3,Even a caveman can operate it!!!,"I have never used this wireless presentation remote prior to a music and lecture event that my wife and I performed in front of 150 people. It worked like a champ the very first time right out of the box in rehearsal. However, right before our event it stopped operating. The laser did not work and the unit did not advance the slide on my powerpoint. After trying new batteries to no avail and then the old batteries again, the wireless remote mysteriously began working. It was a bit of a scare. There is a chance that the issue was with the laptop but why did the laser temporarly quit operating? Not a bad item if everything works as it should."
5,high quality,"I purchased and used this remote for an author presentation. I have used cheaper clickers before, and this one just felt more solid. It worked well, it had no problems, and it takes AAA batteries, which is great because they're easier to find than some of the other more specialized batteries. The laser is convenient, and the USB port stores inside the device when not in use. I recommend this device."
1,Waste of Money!!,"I purchased this to replace a device given to me a year ago (same device, lasted one year only). I ordered the replacement hoping it would last longer than the original -- Imagine my chagrin when the new device lasted exactly 3 days! Long enough for me to have thrown all of the packaging away. I am now stuck with an expensive paperweight! What a waste of money!!"
5,CLP,Absolutely the best investment I have recently made. It works great for PowerPoint presentations in conference rooms and lecture halls while I am among the students and the laser pointer is excellent.
1,Lost USB receiver means replacing whole unit,"This worked well while it lasted, but I deeply resent having to replace the whole unit after losing the USB microreceiver. Why does Kensington or Amazon not make this available as a replacement part?"
5,Awesome,"Awesome.Works flawlessly on Windows, Mac, zero (yes, zero) setup issues.Very happy.Could be smaller i suppose, but, whatever...."
4,"Works very well, but oh, my, the packaging!","This wireless presenter replaces a Kensington presenter I lost, and I'm very pleased with it. It's easy to use, no set-up, and works very well to control PowerPoints. The USB receiver snaps into the base of the control unit, so it's unlikely to fall out and get lost.My only quibble is the manufacturer's packaging - my word, all that plastic and cardboard to house one little device???"
2,F5 Key Functionality is a Nuisance,"I wasn't aware of fact that the laser pointer turned on F5 until after I bought it--this was completely undocumented. As others have commented, this can create problems depending on what F5 is set to do in the application you are using--in my case (using TuringPoint) opening an unwanted dialog box. When I contacted Kensington technical support, their suggestion was that I unplug the USB every time I wanted to use the laser pointer! But in looking at the previous reviews I see that another user has described a hack to disable this feature--thanks!"
4,Outstanding Product with Mac,"The Kensington Wireless Presenter does what it should do, simply and effectively. It works seamlessly with the Mac platform and it has excellent range. I recommend the product."
2,Freezing,"I just purchased this product almost 2 weeks ago, and what I can see that buttons sometimes freeze and that I have to click on them more than once to work. It was kinda of embarrassing when presenting at a conference. I'd like to return it."
5,Works well,This device does everything I hoped it would based on the advertizing. I use it for power point presentations using my Windows 7 system. It also advances pages opened by Office Word.
3,Bought 3 of them - 1 quit working,"This device works fairly well (when it's actually working). I bought three of them to use at our school, and 1 of them died after a couple of years. 3 stars is the best I can give for it."
5,Works Great,Ordered this for my boss. It helps with his presentations. Pretty much works right out of the box and is cross platform compatible.
5,Perfect Presenter,This presenter is just what I needed for teaching classes. It is easy to use and has a screen black out button which is great for directing participants attention to flip chart activity. The presenter is comfortable to handle and works great. Very good product for those who conduct presentations or teach classes.
3,Not so great,"I purchased this product mainly for my PPT presentation in my class. I found weird behavior after 4th or 5th day.Even though holding this firmly in your hand, it changed slides and I was not in a position to control.If you are using laser beam on computer monitor, it will not work.Rest seems to be fine."
5,Works Great and is Essential for Presenations,"Now that I am in grad school, I am constantly giving presentations. I find that many times, it can look very unprofessional to walk over to the screen and point, then go back to the computer and click, or use the small mouse pointer to direct attention on the slide. I bring this to all the presentations I give and listen to, and most of the time they use my presenter and ask where I got it! It's a one time investment that makes absolute sense for anyone who knows that they will be giving lots of presentations over the years.The laser is vivid and easy to spot out. Green lasers are okay, but people expect to look for a red dot still, not a green one. Also, it's very ergonomically designed and very nice to hold in your hands. I've had this for a while now and really love it."
2,Computer does not recognize that the laser pointer is connected,I purchased this for office use. this pointer does not work with my lenevo IBM computer nor with any of my colleagues. The computer does not recognize that a new hardware is connected.very disappointed
5,Works perfectly for Mac Mountain Lion & Keynote,"I was very particularly looking for a remote that would both be a great product and work well with our company Macs (running OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion) and with Keynote. With this product we've had NO problems whatsoever. I couldn't figure out how to set it up at first, but that's because I didn't have to :) It worked RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX! Just pop in the Bluetooth transmitter tool into the computer and start the presentation: DONE!Also love the form factor of the product. Nice and clean design. I just love holding this thing, ha ha!"
4,PLUG and PLAY!,Great remote for controlling your powerpoint presentations. Works great with Mac OS X. The built in pointer is excellent and the range of this remote is pretty impressive. All in all a great buy.
3,"Nice, but not for me","I got this as a gold box deal for less that $20. I got it due to the price. I wanted to use this with Linux, but alas, my app doesn't work with it. Very disappointed about that. Mostly why I give it three stars.But, it feels nice in the hand, it's substantial, and the buttons are placed nicely. I really wish it had worked on my app, as it felt really nice to use. If I was using powerpoint presentations, I would definitely use this one."
1,Too easy to break,"I used it a couple times and it just simply doesn't work now.This product comes with 2 years warranty, but too complicated to claimed.So, I am going to buy a new one/new brand instead."
5,Works Great - I recommend it,"I was impressed with how simple it was to use. Simply plug in the wireless USB to my Windows computer. It recognizes the device and I start using it. Simple and easy. I especially like having the laser pointer built in, so I only have to handle one device."
4,"Excellent device, with one ""small"" problem.","I use this remote presenter primarily with Apple Keynote on a Macbook Pro, and it works beautifully. I am a university professor teaching classes in the 25-35 student range in medium sized classrooms, and it's great to be able to go anywhere I want in the room and run my presentations as well as use the laser pointer. There is literally no learning curve for this device -- it's just plug and play.The only problem I have with the remote is that the USB stick that powers it (and also serves as a flash drive) is very small and therefore easy to lose. In fact I'm soon to be on my second Kensington remote because I lost the USB stick to the first one. Without the USB stick, the device is useless -- not even the laser pointer works apart from the USB. This isn't Kensington's fault; it's just a problem of the world we live in where memory devices are growing larger in capacity but smaller in size every day."
5,Great!,I had to present for five hours. This worked great. Moved back and forth through the slides with ease and was able to point out important images with the laser.
3,Works but at shorter distance,"At distances over 30 feet, I found that I had to push buttons 2 or 3 times to get it to work. At shorter distances worked great."
2,Range too short,I bought this remote as a backup to a Satechi SP-400 and was sadly disappointed. It has less than half the range of the Satechi and lacks several features I use. The Satechi has a button for blanking the screen and a separate button for changing the presentation mode as well as a switch which lets you use it as a remote mouse. The Kensington advanced slides eratically when 25 feet from the computer and failed completely at 35 feet. The range was unsatisfactory in our auditorium. The Satechi SP-400 operates fine from 75 feet away. I returned the Kensington and bought another Satechi SP-400. The Satechi is well worth the extra $5.
4,Nice and Small,Very good laser pointer and with good range. It is small enough to carry. I wish they can also click on the screen to allow starting animations w/o clicking on the screen through the mouse.
5,excellent and highly useful product,"product was extremely efficient and useful in presenting Virginia's Boating Safety Course several times per month. device replaced the need for my partner or me to sit at the laptop to advance (or back up) the several hundred slides used in our presentation, while easily accessing an excellent laser pointer to emphasize key points on a slide."
5,Had to have my own,"I do a lot of customer presentations and I finally decided to just buy moy own clicker, rather than use the ones that were provided by the AV people. I have used this model before and always found it easy to use and reliable, so I bought one. Works great, no problems at all. Would definitely buy again."
4,Works but laser pointer not that bright,"Works great with my Macbook pro. I haven't had any problems with it not being detected and working. What bothers me is the laser pointer! It is not as bright as I need/want. Sometimes I lose track of it on the screen. Maybe I should change the batteries and that'd help? It was super bright though immediately upon buying it. For the price though it's pretty good, and I'd probably buy again."
2,Kensington 33374... Don't waste your money!,"The Kensington 33374 looks very high-tech and is easily installed but lacks in some very important areas. First off, I present to large groups of people and do not like to stand in one spot when I present. The Kensington will not change the slides on the laptop if you are more than 20 feet away or if there is obstructions between myself and the USB plug in. The pointer also projects a very small red dot, which is almost impossible to see from further distances. I recommend the PowerPresenter from StreetSmart. It is a little bit more expensive but has been worth every penny. The slides will change every time whether I am 10 feet away or 110 feet away."
4,A Very Well designed Unit,"The Kensington pointer is half the price of competing units but better designed and functions better than others. The case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use. Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed to prevent the laser turning on when the unit is packed for a trip or placed in one's pocket. And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time! The only thing holding this from being a 5 star item is the weak laser pointer. I would be happy to pay an extra $20-$30 dollars to have this same pointer with a bright green laser. Nevertheless, a very well designed, functional unit."
2,Seems awfully familiar..?,"While this is a well written book that moves along at a good clip there is one big problem with it-it has essentially been written before. The plot and characters bear too much resemblance to the masterpiece of this genre, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" by the master himself, John Lecarre. I hope that the author can apply himself to some truly original material in the future."
2,Very Disappointing,"This book combines one-dimensional characters with poor dialog and a plot that is not credible. The text is riddled with trite phrases which would have been removed by a good editor. The author seems more concerned with demonstrating his knowledge of spy ""tradecraft"" than creating characters with depth who speak like real people. I had high hopes for this novel but have put it down with no intent to finish it."
2,Got through it,"Mediocre. The vaunted ""tradecraft"" seems like something any attentive TV viewer would know. And he should have left it all out, for it succeeds in making his hero seem even stupider than he is: every decision, every move he makes, is wrong. The characterization is non-existent to vapid, but you don't expect much from something like this. IMHOP, any comparison to LeCarre is way off the mark."
3,a little too real,"This was a decent story, but it was so real that it was boring. I'm sure it was an accurate representation of spycraft, but who wants to read about the mundane aspects of it?"
3,Could be better,"This product was fine, but could be really great if the top of it zipped shut, rather than snapped shut."
2,Bag,Well made as are all coleman products. I just do not see the point as this is just an open bag that is not very easy to handle or keep from spilling.
3,Was expecting too much?,"I am guessing I was expecting too much. The sides are flimsy, which helps when collapsing for storage of course, but the sides sag down over the items."
3,Okay,There were really only two main songs that I actually knew on this cd. It helps pass the time when you're bored!
2,nope,"only one song they had but it was the truth though,another female group i can say we had some good female groups back in the day even if they did only have one are 2 songs hell they where nice to look at, but now .naw i aint gonna do it you figure it out you feel me from oh10"
2,"Shipped on time, but not compatible","I did the research, used the right ID numbers, but this part for my chain saw did not fit. Had to return it. Admittedly, my chain saw is unusual and difficult to find parts for."
4,A good tutorial on the S programming language.,"This is the first book I've found that approaches the S programming language as more than an inconvenient detail that you have to learn to get to the cool statistics functions in ""S-Plus."" It's much more accessible than most of the books on S or S-Plus for people who aren't actually statisticians, but need to use the language for some reason."
5,Nice Collection of Horror Movie Themes,"This disk contains some of the most famous and clever horror and sci-fi themes from the 'B-Movie' drawer from the past twenty years. Each track sums up the music from the film in question nicely. A further bonus are the liner notes which provide fascinating insights into the tracks on the disk and the composers who created them.High points of the anthology is the 'Escape from L.A.' medley which shows that an inferior sequel can have a superior soundtrack while playing with the cues from the original flick, the sample of the bizarre southwestern blues rock score from 'Vampires,' Howard Shore's 'Crash' and Christopher Young's 'Urban Legend' theme.All in all, the tracks on this disk are all examples of high-quality film scoring... even if the movies they supported weren't always the best. It's a worthwhile addition to the collection of any movie music lover."
4,A Good Calculator - But Not Like the Old HP,"This is a good calculator. I like the basic functionality and two line display. Some of the necessary key strokes for functions I typically use (like 'STO') are inconvenient. This is the best non-graphical calculator I have seen that is currently being made (by any company), but I don't like it as well as the HP-32SII."
1,Erratic Enter Key,"The enter key on mine doesn't work reliably, so ""3 enter 4"" leaves a 34 in the x register (rpn mode). Not good.HP help suggests to try leaving the batteries out for 24-48 hours.It came with the batteries out for 24-48 hours.You'd think they'd suggest replacing the unit. It sounds like a warranty run-around is coming up.UPDATE: Wrong! HP is very good about replacing the unit, on the phone."
5,Best HP made in a while,"As an engineer who thought that the HP41 was the best calculator made, this is a close second."
4,Back in Business,"After 27 years of daily use in engineering design, the HP 41CV I bought in college in 1982 finally died. After looking around for a calculator that had the same features and keyboard layout as the old trusty HP 41CV, I decided to purchase the HP35s. After a couple of weeks of use, I can say that HP has a calculator that operates almost exactly like the older version that I used for so long. The keyboard feel and the reverse polish notation (RPN) logic are what I am accustomed to with my old calculator. The only drawback is that the keypad buttons on the HP35s are not in the same location as on my old calculator, so it will take a little getting used to before I am proficient in using the new device. But if it lasts as long as my first and only HP product, then I'm sure that I figure out the slight changes and will be a pleased HP customer for years to come."
2,Frustrated HP's customer,"This is the 3rd HP calculator I bought (the other 2 were the hp 33s). All have the same problem, after using a while the keys start loosing and dont work. It is not even a month and one of the keys does not work properly, I have to hit very hard to make it work. I contacted Hp support, sent to them the calculators 2 weeks ago and I hope they will send me a new one.In the other hand, I like the RPN system so these calculators are the best for working with calcs. HP shall consider building calculators that last more, I wont mind paying more for a good product. My first calculator last 15 years and was a CASIO."
5,HP 35s Scientific Calculator,"I purchased the HP 35s to replace my HP41cx. I use this calculate to perform Vertical Curve calculations for designing road grades. I gave the HP35s to a friend to program it for Vertical Curves. He looked up on the internet, for the vertical curve program to personalize the HP35s for my use. The calculator works flawlessly. Thank you HP for finally coming up with ""easier to use"", calculator and program for Vertical Curves."
4,Much better than recent offerings,"In general, I am very happy with this calculator. They finally moved the ""ENTER"" key back to where it is supposed to be. Minor quibbles.First quibble: I don't know if its me, but occasionally it will miss a key press when I'm inputting stuff and when I'm going fast and get to the end of a rather complex set of operations, it is annoying to realize that it recorded 12.35 instead of 102.35 several steps ago.Second quibble: Its not the 90s anymore, HP really could have made the stack bigger than 4 numbers. My HP 48G's nearly infinite stack really spoiled me. Unfortunately, you can't get a 48/49/50 with a decent keyboard layout anymore, and key placement is more important to me than stack size. Only have a stack of 4 is a little annoying, but not the end of the world.Final quibble: Watch batteries? Really? HP couldn't make it use AAA batteries? Its a minor quibble, but I always have AAAs laying around, but never have watch batteries laying around."
3,If you want RPN...,"In summary: If you want an RPN scientific calculator, this is it.HP 35s Scientific CalculatorAs far as I know, the only Reverse Polish Notation calculators you can get are from HP: The 35s, 33s, and 12c. The 12c is a buisiness calculator and no good if you need even something as basic as trig functions. The 33s has many buttons arranged like the grill on an Edsel, with many functions per button--very hard to navigate around.The 35s is satisfactory as a reincarnation of the more than 30-year old HP35 design, but offers few improvements. It uses small, expensive, CR2032 batteries and a low-resolution, hard to read 2-line display.But if you want RPN, as I did, you are forced to go the HP and pay many times what and eqivalent ""algebraic"" calculator would cost.Quality of construction appears to be adequate, but HP has seemingly learned that it's not good business to build stuff to last forever."
1,Very difficult to use,Very difficult to understand how to use. Directions were not easy to follow or conclusive. Very very disappointed in the product.
5,HP rules,HP has yet again delivered a real scientific calculator for real work. It's nice to know that there are still engineers working for the company building tools for engineers. I've been waiting for them to get back to the core design that made them the leaders in the calculator world. The design is classic HP and the quality and durability reigns supreme over any other maker. Thanks HP for going old school. Amazon deserves a bit of praise for providing great service and getting this to me quickly .
5,Excellent,A number of my EE colleagues ordered their HP35 after seeing mine. The keyboard is excellent.
2,My Two HP-35S Calculators are Both Defective,"Both of my HP-35S calculators have the same problem. They frequently ignore key strokes resulting in incorrect answers. For example, I press the enter key. Most of the time it records the enter key stroke. Some of the time it doesn't. The same is true for any other key that gets pressed. You have to constantly check the display for entry accuracy, otherwise the answer it gives may be wrong."
1,Way slower than 33s,"I own both 33s and 35sThis 35s has a little more things, and some major buttons got shifted back to the 2nd or 3rd buttons which make uncomfortable.Also 35s doesn't recognize numbers quick enough, and it calculates fairly slower than 33s does. It would be ok for those of you do not care about speed, but i can tell you it's slower than 33s and doesn't do much more than 33s. I highly recommend 33s rather than 35s for you guys taking TMSCA and UIL tests."
4,HP 35s Scientific Calculator,"I've rated this product with 4 stars mainly because I'm new to this calculator. I read many of the reviews before I bought this calculator, and to the advice of my civil engineering teacher, surveying teacher, and because I'm still getting comfortable as I use the calculator. I would recommend this calculator to anyone, mainly, because of the overwhelming reviews and advice of every other person I talked to before I bought this calculator. Learning to use this calculator will become better with increased use."
2,Crummy RPN,RPN does not work well and the stack is only 4 deep. I'm very disappointed in this machine. Don't buy this calculator if you've been using HP Calculators and are expecting RPN operation as HP has historically provided it. HP - DON'T MAKE A CALCULATOR AND SELL IT AS RPN IF YOU CAN'T GET IT RIGHT! THIS SHOULD NOT BE THAT HARD TO DO.
4,HP35s,"As always, HP has a great calculator. It is not as powerful as my 48GX, but was all I needed for my PE exam. Only dissappointing item was the case...a friend of mine bought the same 35s from another site and the case sent with his is far better than the slip case sent with mine."
4,"Finally, something to replace the 33s trainwreck","The buttons and display are very crisp.The multiline display is good, but needs some improvement.With regard to the 33s, the batteries need to be replace frequently.The 33s is a P.O.S."
4,HP35S isn't an HP35,"I'm a long time HP user with 2 HP 35 a 45 and the 67. The HP 67 is my favorite.With the 35S, changed the way the original HP35 worked as some functions are reversed. The 35, 45 and 67 all work the same but the 35S is backwards. I'll probably stay with the 67 as it is just easier to use."
2,cheap imitaion of a classic,"A classic maligned, this. This is NOT the HP-35s Scientific Calculator, much beloved since its debut in 1972: this is a cheap imitation, made in China. The minus key on mine is defective: I have to press it twice to register a minus. It's so cheap, though, it probably isn't worth the bother of replacing it. I wouldn't mind spending $400 for a good calculator, like the HP-35s in 1972. It's -so- sad that HP has come to this. I'd give it one star for being such a piece of junk, except the basic idea was wonderful, so it gets two. Still, this does not cut it. As I've told more than one undergraduate: a good idea shoddily done doesn't impress anyone."
3,HP 35s,"Coming from a 48G, this calculator is quite a step down and actually a little more difficult to use. I need this calculator for a test and went with the HP since I thought that it would be a breeze to learn because of my familiarity with the 48G. Other than the basic operations and RPN, the function layout is completely different. It's nice, but I expected HP to maintain some consistency to enhance usability."
3,Great Product except documentation....,This is a great calculator.Only issue that I have is the CD with the documentation that came with it is cracked to the extent that nothing can be read off of it.
3,bad display,"The LCD used in this product is not a standard 8x5 pix., it looks cheap, As an owner of HP45 for the past 37 years and other HP calculators, the look of this display is very bad."
4,HP35s Calculator,"Excellent number cruncher!, I was used to the HP48 in college and then tried other brands w/o RPN. No good, I had to go back to RPN. I work as an engineer and these days most number work is done by the computer, but the times I do need a calculator, I want an HP.I do wish the screen was bigger so I could view more lines of numbers, but didn't want to spend the money on one like that, plus I wanted the wider ENTER key of the 35s."
4,Back to HP and RPN,"My first HP calculator was purchased in 1986 when I was an undergrad in engineering (HP 15C)- RPN took a little to get used to, but it was worth the effort. For grad school I upgraded to an HP 28S, which was state of the art back then. Over the past ten years or so, I have reverted back to using an algebraic calculator at work.Recently, a new coworker showed me his HP 33S. The price was right and it could be used in either algebraic or RPN modes. I wanted to get back to RPN and read the on line reviews for both the 33S and 35S calculators. For how I use a calculator at work, the 35S price and convenience of having an RPN calculator again was right for me.I'm back to using an HP, on RPN mode, and happy that I made the move!"
5,Good HP,"I got my HP35s and I like it. I own an HP41CV also. It is very easy to program it, especially they replaced the PROMPT command which you have to key in in HP41CV with INPUT key-very convenient. I am glad HP is back with its line of quality calculators. Behnam"
1,Worthless for a professional,"I got this because I'm going back to school and it's one of the few calulators you are allowed to use for the Surveying exam. As soon as I pass that exam it's off to the thrift store because it's a complete piece of garbage. It only has 10 built in unit conversions, so say for example you need to convert Miles to meters you will have to convert your miles to inches manually then use the calulator to convert to cm then you have to conver the centemeters to meters manually. Complete waste of time, I could build spread sheets to do the math faster than doing things using this calculator.Hopefully HP will start re-building the old 48's one day."
4,Buttons are improved,"The calculator is vastly improved over the 33S. However, the polar to rectangular coordinate conversion is different from all the other HP calcs and required a rewrite of the surveying programs that we use. This is our third sample of this model and the tactile feedback has improved since the first one."
3,"Good Product, Poor Customer Service","You get a CD with the full operational manual. Unfortunately, if you don't have a printer it won't do you much good. HP says that you can receive a full manual by calling Customer Service and requesting one. Assuming you can get through that is. I sent an email request and have never heard back from HP. Powerful tools are only as useful as your knowledge to use it to it's capacity. I doubt that I'll ever be proficient at something I don't fully understand. No thanks to HP."
1,case not as depicted,"1st world problem - did not get the case depicted, that is, the nice ""clamshell"" style thatyou can leave the calculator in while using. This one comes with a cheapo sleeve case.Deceived."
3,hp35s calculator,bought one of these to replace my trusty HP11C. whereas the HP11C has a very clear liquir chrystal display the HP35s has a pixal formation of the numbers which just is not as clear to read. HP still make the 12C so why not the 11C or 15C that so many people love. its smaller and much nicewr (solid) feel then the plastic China made HP35s. anyway I want a RPN so there are not too mmany choices. fortunatly the 11C did not die so the 20 year old unit is still the first thing I grab.
5,HP 35,A very good Calculator for the price. I have a HP 48S that I used for years. I bought the HP 35 for my PE Review. This is one of two HPs permitted in the exam room.
3,Rusty!,"I've owned Whiteside bits before, and they are excellent. This set, purchased from Deerso and fulfilled by Amazon, arrived rusty! The rust appears to have occurred at the factory, as it is underneath the factory-applied protective coating, as well as on the shafts of some of the bits, despite their feeling oily. Probably just a bad batch, but disappointing nonetheless, as my project is now on hold awaiting a new set from a different vendor...."
4,I LIKED IT,I love any Repairman Jack stories. F. Paul Wilson is a great story teller. I'm looking for all of the books by him.
2,Big disappointment after reading first two great prequels.,"I'm disappointed after I read first two good books (Tomb and Legacies). This book doesn't really make sense with a lot of mumbo jumbo and not as interesting as the previous ones. I just lost interested after reading a hundred pages, but forced myself to finish it as quick as I can. It would be nice if Mr. Wilson put more variety in his novels without using Pine Barrens in each story, for ex. Also, writing about supernatural in this Repairman Jack novel, please. They don't really fit together with RJ character to my opinion. Write something like in real life like Legacies or a short story in Barrens and Others. I hope the next novels will be much better."
5,Nightmarish Drama-action-mystery.,Although this story had it's weak spots I could not call the story weak. The nightmarish drama and mystery in this book was much more than enough to keep me reading like crazy and looking into the shadows. The book is truly a shocker in it's dynamic plot. I think it was one of the most amazing peices of literature out there and my favorite book.
2,Where's the old Jack?,"""Conspiracies"" was a hollow read and a lame sequel to ""The Tomb"". I loved ""The Tomb"", read it 2 or 3 times since 1986. However, in ""Conspiracies"", too much time was spent on developing (or rather underdeveloping) characters that lacked any dimension, and in presenting too many dead-end subplots.I felt it lacked the tension, excitement, and action from ""The Tomb"". And I didn't like the tease of a ""grand conspiracy theory"" that left me with more questions than answers. The ultimate revelation was disappointing.I hope the next (final?) Repairman Jack novel will revive the character developed in the first book."
2,Legacies Was Better,"While I love 'repairman jack', Conspiracies was too over the edge with supernatural mumbo jumbo. Bring back story lines similar to Legacies if this series is to continue."
5,The Best Kind of Addiction,"Well, what can I say? I'm a Repairman Jack junkie. It all started with one book. That was it; I was hooked. IMO, Repairman Jack is one of the best fictional characters ever developed. I'm first in line to buy every new book. This, like most of Wilson's stories, mixes the surreal with the real in a way that seems almost plausible. Keep up the good work."
4,A good diversion overall,"It's been a while since I read ""The Tomb"" and I didn't realize that it was actually turned into a series of books. I haven't read ""Legacies"" and might should have before reading this book. However, this is a good book and I actually enjoyed the variety of conspiracy theories that are put forth.There are parts where it seems a little disjointed and I will agree with another reviewer that the SESOUP Sunday schedule being placed on the last page is a bit odd and could be an editorial error. However, I consider that a minor issue.Bottom line, if you enjoy books that are a little far-out, you should enjoy this one. I can definitely recommend it."
1,Not so impressed after all,"I was impressed at first at the low price for the item, the prompt delivery of the item. But what did not impress me was the box that it was shipped in. The box was so many times bigger than the contents which means that it was so loose inside and was banged around during shipping. Also, the box was badly dammaged and the parts for the ab scissor are in bad shape, it's as though they were defective parts put together to sell for a cheeper price. The parts may indeed be brand new but defective. Now to top that all off (which did not supprise me the least bit) when I e-mailed the co., at the first they sent me some replacement parts (which also were shipped the same way as they shipped the first time, in a huge box and in poor condition) but they would never responded to my request to exchange the equipment for another one. So, it is not the way you start that matters but how you finnish."
4,Works well but loud,"The first time I used it to remove scum from my shower door I was shocked by the loudness. I got used to it, sort of. It did the job, although this is not probably its best application. It does seem to remove wrinkles from clothes and loosens tough stains without chemicals. The photos shown here are not the S3210R by the way. Look and you'll see the model number is totally different."
4,Domino's debut is solid,"This album took off with the hit singles Ghetto Jam and Sweet Potato Pie but this album had much more.Like Money is Everything,That's real and Long Beach Thang.Theres more.I didn't give it a 5 due to only havin 10 songs.Had it had 15 and all 15 stayed at the level of these 10 then its a 5 maybe more.If you dont have this album get it."
2,Mostly frustrating,"This could have been a great text. The chapter writing is detailed and provides interesting examples so that you understand the formulas and concepts being presented. Then you get to the problem sets, and half of the problems seem to have been written for a different textbook. I spent more time trying to figure out what was being asked of me then I did actually solving problems. And then there is the CD. The information on the text files is not properly formatted in a manner that is useful.In the end, I was frustrated trying to learn from a text that makes language a barrier rather than a facilitator."
1,Flunks basic statistics,One of the first things you learn when studying statistics is that correlation does not equal causation. Yet on the very first page of this book the authors ignore this precept in order to engage in a bit of political propaganda.You'd think someone writing a textbook would be smarter than that.
3,Not for the intro-level Stat student,"Bought this off Amazon for the cheapest price for my intro Stat class. Overall, it wasn't that bad because my professor explained the topics in it very well, however, if not for her, the notes and explanation section in the book are much too verbose and lacking good, clear examples. For instance, my Calculus textbook notes section before chapter problems has at least 2-3 problems for every type in varying difficulty whereas this only has one explanation contained in paragraphs."
3,Better versions out there.,"Required item for class. A regular statistics book would be much more useful, even when reporting biological data sets. Some of the graphs and data sets presented are confusing."
2,Principles of Biostatistics,"This book does not give step-by-step instructions on how to solve problems. Therefore, I feel it is not a good book. I still feel very lost after reading chapters in this book."
4,too wordy,"It is written for students who dont have a good mathematical background..Therefore it is too wordy for an engineer , physics or math student..as a student with such background, I founded many long explanations redundant as they could be said in 2 lines.."
2,Complicated language,The language in this book is very hard to understand. I took statistics when I was an undergrad and but this book is so hard to understand. The authors tried to show more steps in the math examples maybe try to make it easier for the reader but it just make it MUCH more complicated to follow. Sometimes I have to read my undergrad statistics book in order for me to understand the same thing it says in this book.
4,Great Read!,"This was a great book, its got a little bit of everything in it. Romance, humor, suspense, excitement, and God!"
3,Along Came Jones,"Good book but I probably won't read it again. I enjoy historical romance more and my preferences lean more toward serious storylines. If you are looking for a light, contemporary romance with a little mystery, you will enjoy this book."
5,Real to Life,"This book is as real to life as possible in its discription of the events from Windover to Tinian and on to History. My grandfather served under Tibits and is pictured and mentioned several times in this book. As I turned the pages I was reading what I had heard first hand for several years from my grandfather spelled out across the pages. The attention to detail and recreation of the stories, events, and emotions capture the readers attention and draw you in. The various perspectives of the events also allows the reader to understand the magnitude of the bombings and the enourmous undertakingas that transpired prior to the event.This is a must read for those who are interested in WWII History. I will pass this book along through the generations as the most accurate account of what transpired for my Grandfather and the men who served along side him."
3,ok,"this game boy micro has a smsll screen and the same poor graphics as the sp but I like how you can change the face plates, insted of buying this game boy, save your money and buy a PSP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Sucks!!!,This is worse than GBASP. sure micro has a brighter screen but nintendo is making a brighter screen for SP so it is just as bright as micro. This thing dosen't play other game boy games and DS games. And the screen is smaller than the orignal game boy screen. You can get a cheaper SP with more bulid in stuff. This is a bit pricerier than the current sp price. The system was designed badly. Lets just hope that game boy evolution does alot better than Micro and SP.
1,Awnsering Question,"Melissa this system does not come with games,you have to buyGameBoy Advance games,it won't play nothing else."
5,"Very nice system, despite the screen size.","The Nintendo Gameboy Micro is a wonderful piece of technology that is a must have for collectors. The GBM is a small yet powerful system that has a very bright but small screen, fantastic buttons, and truly wonderful portability."
1,nintendo has done it they created a game system no one will buy,I no what your thinking then why did you buy one? I bought one beacuse i am really rich and can afford it. Ok on to buisness first of all it is a tiny 2inch screen. I had to squint just to see the game. When I bought mine it worked ok for the first hour then as i was playing it it short circuted (in other words it was fried). The price is outrageous $100.00 your better of buying the nintendo DS for $129.99 which i would recomend. I leave you with this thought is it all WORTH IT?
1,stop buying the same thing over again,Ok when gameboy advance came out i said alright a new systemoh boy got that. then when sp came out i was like ok a remakeof gba and then when this garbage came out i found out they wasjust jipping u besides i didnt get it im grown now screw nintendo. if you get anything get a psp of at least a dsfor 30 bucks more
5,good product too big price!!,"excellent piece of equipment, however, paid 69.95 for this online and was on sale at Walmart for 30. 00!!!"
2,GB Micro,"Shipping sucked, Had to wait an extra week for the adapter, meaning I couldn't play it for the first week. No face plate, and a huge dent in the top of it. Has a horrible appearance.Other than that, It's good. Does everything else it should."
5,Fantastic for kids of all ages!,My son is 3 and he loves to play games on this system. The screen is not so small that you lose clarity. It's really a great little gameboy and I'll admit that I love to play it too! So much that we bought 2 of them so we all had a chance! It's definitely recommended - and for this price - you can't go wrong!
4,Lots of fun in a little package,"If you are looking to play Game Boy Advance games but want something a little smaller and stealth this is for you. I'm a lot older they your ""typical"" Game Boy player and this allows me to get my Mario Bros, Tetris fix on without looking like a parent who stole their kids Game Boy. A little on the small side so those with big hands or bad eyes may want to stay away but it's a ton of fun."
4,awsome,"Over all I think it is a cool gameboy.But one bad thing is it only plays gba games(GBA)gameboy advance.It has 4 light brightness levels and you can switch face plates that you buy seperate depending if it is used or not.It is small and can fit into any pocket.It takes regular headphones unlike the gameboy advance sp that needs special headphones.It depends if you want this or not.I got the sp when I was little and I played it like crazy then I later sold it for the gameboy micro.After I got the micro I decided to get the first gameboy advance.I recommend it but if you don't ,well that's ok too."
4,Very underrated console!,"Although it released at the end of the Game Boy's lifespan at the rise of the DS and DS Lite, this little system's still perfect for playing Game Boy Advance games on the go in an incredibly portable size. There are a few downsides to this, though: although it comes with customizable faceplates, the faceplates are very easy to break. Also, this device cannot play any of the older Game Boy titles, so keep that in mind if you love to play the older Game Boy games.Overall, it's an underrated console... but it's to be expected, coming so far into the GBA's lifespan. I would certainly reccomend this to everyone who just wants to play GBA games on the go."
4,Great shoes for work,"I purchased these shoes in navy, black, and the brown w/ brown croc. The navy is a true navy, not so dark that they look black. They definitely run a 1/2 size small. However, once I returned them and received the bigger size, they were great! They are perfect for work, or any dressy casual occasion."
2,Runs small and tight on the toes,"Although well constructed, they are smaller than a normal size 5 and they are a bit tight on the toes. Surprising for me as I don't have particularly wide feet. Wouldn't buy again."
4,Decent Camp Cooker,"I love this little oven. It has extended my menu options when camping significantly and is much lighter and cleaner than my (albeit more versatile) dutch oven. I've done everything from breakfast pastries, to pies and even stuffed cheese shells with success. It is obviously smaller than most ovens requiring specialized cookware. The bottom rack runs quite a bit hotter than the top so it is essential to leave space around whatever you're cooking and rotate between racks to prevent burning. Despite this it performs favorably (outperforming several others in it's class), is small and self-contained with built-in igniter."
5,Quick Review,Introductory level of study. This is a very nice introduction to Leviticus. It's not too technical or advanced so that one is lost in Hebrew textual data.
4,Capleton is the man of reggae! (Best work of his career!),"My friend recently put me on to Capleton and ever since then I've been hooked on his music. Prophecy is the most powerful album I have heard in my life!! My favorites are Tour, Big Time, Heathen Reign and No Competition. The hip-hop remixes are wicked as well. Don't sleep on his hidden track either. 'Nuff Respect Capleton!!!!!!"
2,Don't buy for hummer,These dont fit a hummer. Thy seem to be very well made but we were unable to get them to fit
2,"why do they all have to go ""commercial""","Unfortunately with this album Beenie Man shows us that his work is evolving in the wrong direction. Whereas his earliest albums still have the wicked Kingston, Jamaica sound and rhytm, this album has moved to the ranks of a computer generated song, with all of the beats that seem so out of place in this song. This might attract a bigger audience (and thus more sales), he'd be wise to stick to his roots"
5,An Essential Distillation of a People's Literature,"Moses Hadas was (and perhaps still is) the preeminent scholar of Classical, both Greek and Latin, Literature. In A History of Latin Literature, Hadas explores and defines, explains and unveils, compresses and expounds upon the mass oevre that is Latin literature. Tracing Roman literacy from its early beginnings through its complex years of ""Golden Age"" to its decline, Hadas outlines clearly and concisely. This book is essential for anyone interested in ancient literature. Whether you're a high school latin student, a Classics major in college, or have no understanding or prior knowledge of the Latin language, this book is for you."
5,You'll be glad you read it!,"This book is a great read for the mother that has a teenage daughter, for the single guy, and for the high school student. It is a book that anyone could enjoy. The poetry varies from romantic and sweet to hurt and angry. There's also plenty of inspiration between the lines. Overall, this is a great book about following one's own dreams and listening to your own inner voice."
2,Advertised in a bathroom stall . . . how appropriate,"Going to the bathroom at a local public university I found one of Ms. Jack's poems taped to the stall door telling me to buy her new book here. Frankly, a seventh grade girl who has listened to way too much Christina Aguilera could write more profoundly moving poetry. The poem displayed ""Love and Death"" was insipid and banal."
5,how the Church can be with a wee-drop of courage,"Father Greeley again gives us a peek at could be in a parish and 'what is in parish'. One based on faith, hope, and love with fearless leadership of the 'old priest' and the 'new priest' and a bunch of the usual parishioner suspects, young thru older. This book leaves you wanting to know what 'new priest's' second year will be like as grace works through the Spirit of all congregants. God bless AG."
2,inferior to the first volume,"Don't buy this one until you find somewhere that you can sample the tracks, such as perfectbeat. I personally like the tracks Skin, Unspeakable Joy, and Command & Obey, but many of the others seem to be the kind of repetitive and non-melodic sounds that I hear at clubs I avoid. (And I already have the tracks I like on other CDs.) Your mileage may vary; that sound may be just what you're looking for. I thought the first volume was a lot better, though."
4,Heavy but GOOD!,"John Blair's is the top promoter of New York City's Mega Clubs. This second volume of club favorites is a little heavier than the other two CD's so far released as John Blair Party. This is the least favorite of the three CD's for me, but its still great. DJ James Andersen ignites the night away with these cuts. You have to say this Collection is unique and different than the other two, there's more drums, percussion, some light trance, and also house/tribal. I think ""Unspeakable Joy"" has been on almost every dance collection. Not that theres anything wrong with that, but lets move on. I still give it a high recommendation, though. It will get you dancing, that's for sure."
2,Don't try to move!,I purchased these because of the inline volume control which works as described. The sound is fine too. The headphones are only good if you are not moving your head or body. They are light and kinda flimsy and keep slipping around when I move. I use earphones for outside gardening and walking and working where I don't want to disturb others and these just don't work.
1,Junk Tin Cans,"For the life of me I don't know how these headphones got a 4 star rating. These headphones might be great for kids, someone that listens to talk shows only or someone that has absolutely NO ear for quality sound. They are by far the most tinny sounding headphones that I have ever heard. If you are looking for a good quality sounding headphone with good base for music, than DON'T BUY THESE. You might as well put 2 tin cans against your ears with a string attached and plug it in."
3,V Tech...,"I can say that I was disappointed by the lack of response by both of my boys when it came to the V Tech system. I thought that the V.Smile baby would be a big draw. I also bought the V Tech bigger kid version for my more ""advanced"" twin. It's not as easy as it seems and the babies don't always get the correlation between the TV and the system. It's a challenge, but hopefully they will learn to love it."
1,ICON Reformer Hair Spray,Nozzle was broken on spray can so product would not spray. Not properly packaged so Product had leaked out & nothing left.
2,pizzlle mix,"I just ordered this in the last month and the use by date was December, 2010. There needs to be longer lead time than that."
4,Can't wait to try it...,"This was Christmas gift for my wife.. She asked for it, happy that she received it. Has not baked any pisseles yet. If she's happy, I'm happy..."
1,This was just a bad idea all the way around!,"I am a real baker, so I personally do not find it necessary to pay 20.00$ to receive 9 cups of flour, with premeasured baking powder. There are plenty of recipe sites, which have Pizzelle recipes for free. This may be a fine product, I can't say, because I returned mine, once I realized that I still had to add my eggs, butter/ oil, sugar, and flavorings. I just couldn't see what this product was offering that could make pizelles any better, than if I just used a recipe, and my own flour and baking powder."
2,Pizzelle Mix,Not very good in my opinion. Didn't get crispy when cooled. was a little thick and when I ate a couple of the pizzelles it left a weird taste in my mouth and a film on my tongue. I will have to try some homemade recipe.
5,Coleman 3-burner dual fuel stove,"This stove is the same basic design as those I've used for the last 40+ years. Just that now it burns unleaded gas, which is about one-third the price of Coleman fuel in our area right now.The main reasons for my purchasing the stove were (1) wanting to save on fuel, and (2) wanting a larger cooking area and three burners. The stove delivers admirably on both points. Lots more space than my original two-burner, and the flareups I had expected might occur with gasoline don't happen: it's just like lighting the stove using original Coleman fuel. Highly recommended."
5,Very nice stove!!!!,"This is a nice stove, but don't purchase if you want a small easy to carry model for hiking. This stove is about 32 inches long and really it looks bigger. I wanted to convenience of boiling water while also cooking breakfast. It's nice to have the water hot already for easy clean up of cast iron cookware or for hot cocoa.The center burner is the work horse while the outter burners supply less BTU's. Trust me, they're more than enough as I have to turn down the middle burner to not scorch everything. I use the middle burner to heat water and the outter ones to fry up breakfast. I haven't had it long so I'm not sure about longevity.If you have a family of four or more, I highly recommend this model for camping.It's also nice to have it in case of power outtages during storms."
5,Awesome,"Though this stove takes up a good bit of space in the back of my Jeep, it's well worth it when you can get up in the morning( a windy one at that) and cook eggs, bacon, and.....make coffee!!!!! I had a two burner one, also great quality, but sold it to get this one. Very happy with my choice. It has the same great construction features and simple reliable function that my dads always had. I expect this one to be given to my kids when I get some. I like the liquid fuel over the propane because it is cheaper,and it uses the same fuel as my coleman lanturn. Also in a pinch you can use gasoline(would be great in a survival/emergency situation). Besides the extra size it takes up when packing, the only thing I don't like is there is no way to drain all the fuel out the tank when you want to store it. You could siphon it...I guess. I never did read the instructions either. Anyway, great reliable coleman product."
4,Years of Killer Breakfast!,My dad and I have been going camping since I was 5 years old. I am now 26 and we still go to the same lake every summer. We have had this style Coleman stove for as long as I can remember. My dad actually had this stove before I was born. It is still going strong today! Although it is a little beat up and after cleaning it with a stove cleaner (all the green paint is gone) it still works like new. I highly recommend this stove to the camping enthusiast! Enjoy your killer breakfast as we have for 20+ years!
5,Best camping stove ever.,"I've had mine for 30 years, still works perfectly. They haven't really changed the design which proves you can't improve perfection."
2,we had to return this as it was defective.,My husband had this item before and so do our friends. That is why we purchased it I am waiting for a credit on my account since we had to return it. It has a broken part or something and did not work. IT WAS defective. I think this one was just a lemon and not a reflection of this product. However we would recommend the two burner next time. Our friend loaned us one when we had to return this one to Amazon.
3,Coleman dual fuel stove,"When I ordered this burner, the description said ""dual fuel"", but did not state which two fuels could be used. I thought it would be propane or the Coleman liquid fuel. I was wrong.......it actually was coleman liquid fuel or UNLEADED GASOLINE. Of course we did not want to cook with gasoline. My husband went to Wal-Mart and was able to buy everything he needed to convert the burner to propane at a cost of $50.00.We are now using the burner and are happy with it, just wish we had know in advance that we would have to spend an additional $50.00 to get it working for us.Sandra LuquetteAbbeville, LA"
5,Beautiful Heavy Piece,We ordered this piece not certain if it would match our cabinets. We have hickory in our kitchen and this piece fits perfectly. It too my husband and I most of the day to put it together but we took our time and had fun. It is heavy and very sturdy.
4,beautiful less knwon music by Cole Porter,"This is the companion of the other set, regretably out of print, with 30' music. It contains a group of lesser known songs, but most of it very good. The package is excelent and so de book."
5,Love it!,I bought the first volume for my boyfriend and he loved it. I bought this with it and gave it them both to him on Christmas. Loved the illustrations.
2,Not as described,I just received this item assuming it was 11x2 as described. It is not. The actual dimensions are 13x3.75 inches. This product is heavy in the package and does seam like it would have been perfect.... had it fit.Note to supplier: post this item with outer most dimensions.
4,Walter talks a better album than most singers sing them,That familiar old voice is good as ever. At least one of the songs was one we've searched for for years and were told it wasn't available as it had been a single with limited distribution. We were so happy to find it on this disk.
4,Lots of Nostalgia Here,"If you can make it past the first song on the CD ""Old Shep"" without crying,the rest of the CD offers a delightful selection of classic old songs. My grandfather's favorite song was ""Life Gets Tee-jus,Don't It"", a really funny way that some farm folks felt in the old days, especially those who went through the Depression. Walter Brennan does an excellent job of talking all of these classic songs. There is no voice like his for expression of feelings. From ""Shiftin'Whisperin'Sands"" to ""Dutchman's Gold"", this CD is a delight. In between you get ""I Believe"". I recommend it highly to anyone who remembers Walter Brennan."
3,"If You REALLY Like Walter Brennan, Goldurn It","Neither Walter Brennan nor Elvis Presley first did Old Shep. It was a song written and sung by country music icon Red Foley (Pat Boone's father-in-law.....Debbie Boone's grandfather...oh, well). Close the blinds, grab a hankie and let Walter break your heart. He was such an expressive actor; narration must have been a snap for the old New Englander. I don't know when this package of music was first released but except for ""Dutchman's Gold"" circa 1960, I don't recall any of these songs as being any more than cover versions of others' songs. You also have to have ""Old Rivers"" and Bill Anderson's ""Mama Sang a Song"" (both in 1962) to have the best of Walter Brennan, but go ahead and have a good sniffle with the old Oscar winner. You'll feel better."
2,dangerous,"This is going back to the vendor. The electronic igniter doesn't work and there's very little difference in the flame adjustment, not sensitive enough. I got it lit by using my other mini torch and while it does the job it is much harder to control the flame."
1,i can't describe how dissatisfied I am,"* this product is not intended for people arthritis*Foolishly I order this product and then went away for several weeks, by the time I got to test this product out it was beyond return date. This product has yet to be sold for 10 dollars on craigslist"
3,Good overview of the subject,"Lyons discusses the mechanics of fire, heat, the chemical transformations that occur. Then he veers away into another direction and presents an essay on fire and heating homes which includes chimneys and heaters. Following this is a discussion of the combustion engine, a chapter on great fires of the past and a final chapter on house fires. This is more a social commentary on fire than a scientific study. Perhaps the subject was too limited for a full-size book.Photographs, charts, diagrams and illustrations throughout."
3,Works But Not as Pictured,"It works well but the terminals are bare brass, not tin plated as shown in the picture.I wish they would put something in the description (size, Volt/Amp rating)"
5,Speedy delivery!,"I received my order in just a few days. The book is awesome and was received in better condition than I expected. Very pleased, would recommend."
4,"Good overview of marketing, quick reference, easy reading","This book is a good overview of marketing, covering various aspects useful to a marketing manager. Designed for reading by those with a limited marketing background.It is a good quick reference source for those with a marketing background.It is not intended as an in-depth look at any particular aspect of marketing, however."
3,Good breadth but many other shortcomings,Covers a good variety of topics. But this edition is severely out-of-date. Desperately in need of a newer edition.
2,Dissapointment,"I Went backwards with Third Bass. Derelicts of Dialect (Their Second Release) Was the first that I heard of Third Bass, and I love that album, so I figured no harm could happen with the Cactus album. I was incorrect. I'm not a big fan of the beats here. It's just that all the songs have the same pace of beats and all sound the same. It's not an awful album, just a disapointment from Derelicts of Dialect."
5,Definitely for the collection,"My cassette of this album was taken from my car years ago, and it's one of the few albums I've replaced...Worth the money, buy it"
4,I need help,"Hello my name is Patrice Bond. I listen to jazz most of the day, preferably WNUA 95.5 radio station. That's where I hear new songs to purchase. This is a nice CD, I don't own it but I heard it. My mom loves Lonnie Smith. This is where I need your help. If anyone knows where I could find Transformation (Quiet Moments track) please let me know. That's her favorite and I would like to purchase this for her and can't find a copy no where. It's not available anywhere. It's her birthday and I would appreciate anyone that could help me buy her this. It would be the best gift ever for her. My email address is Patrice_E_McKinley@rush.edu Thank you very very much."
5,Modern Day 'On the Road' for Today's Man,"Ian Winn is the techno pagan octopus messiah! In his tale of his travels through Egypt and the Far East, you feel his pain and joy and then you look at your own existence and dream of escaping from the box we call life. It's a dream tale, with visions, artifacts and a slew of interesting journeymen who crop up to help our narrator find his way (whether indirectly or directly). You also receive some interesting tips on how to save money by traveling immediately after an international crisis. But let Ian tell his story, sit back and strap in for the ride you will not be disappointed and will definitely enjoy passing this to those you consider worthy of reading a piece of art."
3,Fascinating ... yet with no redeeming value,"I opened the book in bookstore, I loved it. It was fascinating and intriguing. I bought it. But after hunderd or so pages, I got that empty feeling that you can get when travelling without purpose. Did not finish it."
3,Challenging!,"I've done this workout three times so far and am still struggling to learn the steps. This workout is fast paced from start to finish. I do work up a sweat and feel I am gradually learning the movements, but because the steps are changing so frequently you don't get a chance to perfect them. It would be helpful to have a section where the steps are paced out slowly for beginners. I have had dance and aerobic classes in the past, but this was challenging to keep up with the steps. It's a great workout, but difficult to follow. There is not a lot of motivation to come back and do it again."
5,FUN WORKOUT,THIS IS A NON STOP AEROBIC WORKOUT. IT IS TOUGH AS SHE KEEPS YOU GOING FROM ONE MOVE TO THE NEXT. THERE ARE OTHERS IN THE VIDEO THAT WORK AT A LOWER INTENSITY IF YOU NEED TO START OUT SLOWER. I DO ADVANCED WORKOUTS AND FOUND THIS TO BE A CHALLENGE. YOU WILL BE SWEATING WITH A SOLID HEART RATE THROUGHOUT THE WORKOUT.
2,Not what I expected,"Too many awkward ""dance like"" moves for someone with two left feet. The cueing could be better. The music is fair."
3,Gets heart rate up,"I like that Michelle actually does the whole workout, unlike so others who instruct, she never stops.Her cues are awful but the moves are so repetitive, they are easy to pick up. It reminds me of an old-school aerobics workout with the dance-like routines.It's great cardio without making you so sore you can't walk or sit the next day. Not an overload of squats or lunges. Can be done high or low impact.The group of women she has in the background are very 'real' which means they are of all shapes and sizes; they look like people you'd see at the grocery store, not intimidating at all."
5,45 minutes of fun cardio!,"This is my favorite cardio workout. It's not so intense that you need to stop and breathe, but you wouldn't be able to hold a conversation either. I've lost 4 lbs so far after doing a mix of this dvd, walking, and Tae Bo, and just placed my order for 3 other ""Your Body Breakthru"" dvd workouts. I like that if I'm short on time I can do the ""express workout"" which takes half the time. You can also go online with your access code for a nutrition plan. Be ready to break a serious sweat but have fun doing the aerobic dance-like moves."
4,Good Workout,"I have many many kickboxing workouts, when i saw this had kickboxing in it i bought it, i never heard of her but it look good, and may i say it's not bad at all. I like it, its different and fun, i highly recommend it. It's good for the days you dont want to do turbo jam"
1,You call that braking performance?,"I got this set of pads (fronts and backs) for my 2005 Audi TT Quattro - a vehicle that sees a lot of use (track and street). I got new rotors at the same time. Did the bedding procedure, and drove around a bit - didn't like the feel at all - basically, it feels like it ""grabs and lets go slightly"" - almost as if you hit the brakes, and let off on the pedal a bit. I drove around for a week with them on, and could NOT stand that feeling. I ditched the set for some Ferodo pads - which are, perhaps, the best pads I've used on this car. I'll definitely PASS on the Hawk and go with Ferodo instead - they give you BITE when you ASK FOR IT, and don't let up until you do.Ferodo part numbers: FCP590H and FCP541H"
2,Not Animated,This video does not contain any animation. It's just the three authors telling their stories. There aren't even any illustrations like with Reading Rainbow.
2,could have been way better,"when i saw the preview for this movie on a VHS copy of Stand Alone, i'm not going to lie, this movie looked action packed. they only had VHS on amazon so i got it. instead i got a movie that was not action packed and had bad or laughably bad acting. it could have been better. i wish i could explain it more but it wasn't ""all that""."
1,The Worst Film Ever Made.,"Oh man this is bad. I mean it's really, really bad. Some highlights: a guy has a t-shirt with ""Music"" written in it, a posse of Viet Nam vets teach a secret signal(tap three times on something) to the people, a man is asked ""Why'dya have ta go 'n waste a good peice a tail like that for?"", a man in a wheelchair puts litter in a bin, someone gives up drinking, a guy stands on top of a building waving a gun, the Viet Nam war is re-enacted on someone's lawn..."
2,A poor choice,"This book is showing its age, especially when 'identifying problems'. The profile of an at-risk person relies on evidence that is shaky at best."
4,Risk paid off,"I was worried these wouldn't be the same material that Levi's are known for. There is the soft stuff that looks like jean that is not (the type used in women's jeans) and the heavier canvas. The light stonewash I received was the heavier canvas. Minus one star because they are about 1/2"" off the the actual length (too long). Even in the stores no two pair seem to be made alike these days so I'm just happy they fit everywhere else."
3,Doesn't fit,The jeans material could be better and it doesn't fit fine (at least for brazilian). Color is ok.
4,good pair of jeans for a good price!,It was a pleasure shopping Amazon for my son's jeans. I found a very good quality pair of Levi 501 jeans for a very reasonable price - and Amazon's shipping was very timely too!
4,"Same size, different fits?","I had a pair of these jeans that I really liked but had developed a tear in the knee. Ordered two pair from Amazon, same size. Strangely, one pair fit just fine, the other pair were somewhat tight. Decided to keep them anyway since I could stand to lose a few pounds anyway :-) But I was a bit disappointed in the lack of consistency in the sizes."
4,"Not bad, but not as good as the STF","I decided to try these out and although they are good jeans I'll stick to the classic shrink to fit in the future. The denim is a little too soft for me, but this might be a good thing for some people. The wash is a good color if you like a dark jean."
3,BAGGY AND CHEAP,THESE ARE NOT THE LEVI 501'S THAT I USED TO LOVE. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW VERY BAGGY THESE WERE. THE QUALITY OF MATERIAL AND STITCHING IS CHEAP. THERE IS NOTHING TO LOVE ABOUT THESE JEANS.
4,Buttons are a pain,I know the buttons are a tradition but zippers are easier and better. The jeans are great so I will put up with the buttons.
4,Nice look,Nice black look for going out! Good price at $49 should have got two but money funny I guess next time
1,These are the worst.,"These jeans are the worst. There is no way my husband can ever wear them. We washed them like normal jeans and then they came out so wrinkled, they were unwearable. I ironed them and then rewashed them, expecting them to come out wearable. Wrong again.Aside from the fact that these jeans were unwearable, when I purchased these jeans, the product page is listed as ""Levi's Men's 501 Jean"". Nothing on the page mentions Shrink to Fit Jean.Horrible. Experience. Will not be purchasing Levi's again."
2,Big Disappointment,"I have relied on Levi's 501s for day-to-day wear for fifteen years now, and I am SO disappointed in the changes the company has made in the last year or two. I use 501s in the black denim, and black denim Levi's shirts. Levi's has switched out to cheaper, lighter-weight fabric in both jeans and shirts. The new fabric is stiff, doesn't have the nice ""drape"" of the real Levi's product we knew, holds wrinkles out of the washer, and does not age into that nice softness I remember. What in the world is Levi's thinking ? Instead of a quality product, we get pouffy names (""clean rigid"" ?) for an endless selection of dye types. How can we make Levi's get back to producing a quality product ?"
1,50-50,"I bought two pair of Levi's from Electrikid and don't feel really happy about it, the jeans were both the same size but one did not fit. The quality of the two was very different, you could notice just looking at the cloth itself.I took a pretty close look at them and noticed that one was assembled in Egypt and the other one in Haiti. It does not really matter where they were built, but standarization was not present at all.I REALLY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT THIS PURCHASE."
2,"Levi, what are you doing to your brand?","As with most of the world, I looked at Levi's as synonomous with ""blue jeans"" or ""jeans"". For me, they were always blue, always ""rigid"" and always ""right"". I did not have to worry whether the material on the 501 was heavy duty, it always was. I didn't have to know that a 501 is ""classic fit"" (which I purchase) verus ""straight"" (which falls off my swelling belly. Now, however, I need to figure out what jeans fit, what color ""snap pop"" or ""clean fume"" is. Does the Levi Strauss company have a marketing/market research department? If so, I suggest firing them, hiring back your old advertising agency, make your jeans (yes, re-install the meaning behind the word ""jeans"")the same, dependable way they were classically made. Remember the lessons learned with ""new Coke"", messing with an icon isn't wise.Otherwise, split off a Levi Strauss Classic and just make 501 jeans in the US by traditional, classic standards.PCN"
1,Would give negative stars if able...,Paper thin fabric will not last anywhere near the 501s of yesteryear. Fit is unreliable. Feel is very disappointing. Will not buy again until Levis goes back to the old denim material. Absolutely disgusted!
1,Nestor,Este articulo aun no me ha sido enviado pero ya lo facturaron y me explican en una alerta que lo puerdo cancelar en cualquier momento no entiendo y necesito saber cuando me envian mi artìculo o me hacen el reembolso de mi dinero
1,Pesimo vendedor,"Yo compré un Levis 501 color azul oscuro talla 35 X 32 y ellos me enviaron uno verde oscuro talla 38 x 32.Este vendedor no se los recomiendo, es muy irresponsable."
2,Messed up description,"I've made an order of Levi's Men's 501 Straight Fit Jean, Light Gray Rigid. It took me long time to get to the package after I've received it, and I've been very disappointed that I've got Shrink-To-Fit jeans instead of Straight Fit, and they are now of a wrong size, and I have no time to return it. Although I like 501 model very much, but this one item is so wrong."
3,not what I expected,"Having bought a couple of other Levi's jeans already from Amazon, I have a good idea now of how the sizing is but when my 501 arrived I was surprised that it wasnt the straight fit jean that it was supposed to be. everybody I had asked to take a look at it commented that it was a baggy pair of pants and not straight leg which is a disappointment personally. I also would like to ask Amazon to mayhaps also make it possible for the purchaser to see where the item is made from/manufactured from. As the quality of the Levis pants is very much dependent on where it was made. The pair of 527's I got was made in Bangladesh and when I first got it, I could already see that the stitches in the back pockets were flimsy and lo, after a few weeks of use they were already fraying, one would think that an original pair of Levis would have better stichings than a pair of knock offs from around the corner. So far I am yet to be impressed"
1,Light Weight Denim,"These jeans should be removed from sale. They are made with cheaper lighter weight denim. Stay away from ordering these inferior, knockoff products"
1,Not the same Levi's,Really disappointed with these jeans. The fabric is so light and feels stretchy. I have been wearing these jeans for 30 years. These are not the same jeans. They seem like knock offs but I think that Levi's has changed the way they make them. Time to find a new pair of jeans after 30 years.
1,Mercancia extraviada,"A la presente fecha aun no he recibido el producto. Nadie me da respuesta del mismo, aparentemente el producto esta extraviado y nadie sabe donde ni como localizarlo."
1,Inconformidad con producto,"Este Producto no fue el que yo seleccione, me parece una falta de seriedad y de etica que coloquen una foto de un producto y cuando uno compre, le envien otro que no fue el color seleccionado.....This product was not that I choose, I think a lack of seriousness and ethical to place a photo of a product when you buy and send him another that was not the selected color .....Levi's Men's 501 Jean"
1,amazon shipped a rusted damaged item,"""i received the item damaged and all the buttons, metals are rusted, deformed. i returned item and replaced with a new one. this costed me time. Product is good, i like it"""
5,fair price,"ok sizing & quality, made in mexico, accord with photography, size is as spected and color as well. it appears to be original levi's."
1,Worst Levis ever!,"I bought my first 501's in the mid 90's, and still own a few pairs I bought in '99. So when I dropped a few sizes I decided to order this 501. It arrived promptly and well-packaged. Though it was a little roomy - I'm happy to report - it looked the part. Unfortunately it did not ""feel"" the part. Compared to my older jeans it was very, very light. After a few weeks one seam broke, actually not the seam, but the fabric next to the seam. After having this was fixed the fabric broke next to one of the back pockets, then next to the fly buttons and yesterday, whilst kneeling down to take a photograph, the entire back ripped. After reading the other reviews pertaining to these jeans it would seem many were right in stating the jeans fabric used by Levis nowadays is of an inferior quality. So, after nearly 20 years of buying 501's I can safely say I'll never buy one again."
1,What happen to 501 Quality Control,"What the happen to levi's quality control. I usually buy levi 501 three or four at a time. The last set i bought the belt loops ripped out, fly button fell out and holes appeared after the second time worn. I hope Levi goes out of business before they are allowed to put more of this trash on the market."
4,501's,Nice jeans by Levi's. All I wear. Great price and fit. All American Made and Red Tag. Fast shipping. Like Amazon for all types of shopping.
5,501,"So far, best fitting 501 jeans I've ever purchased. Even after washing, they still fit like new. No shrinkage noticed. Will definitely buy them again from Amazon."
4,Homemade will never be homemade ever again.,"I bought a pair of 501's from Amazon and they feel a little lighter than my last two pairs I bought right off the shelf at SEARS almost a year ago. That's about it. I'm happy with my purchase. But! I usually buy 505's, but with the great variables in sizing I wont buy that style without trying them on first. Consistency is lost more or less, except with the 501's. The 501 style at least is going to fit the same way each time,no matter if they are made in Egypt or Mexico, Brazil or wherever they originate from. I always bought my jeans at Sears, but when you buy Levi 501's and see Egypt on the tags, well there's outsourcing and then there is outsourcing. Unbelievable, but get used to it. Its here to stay. Homemade will never be homemade ever again, at least for some products that is."
2,I don't like the way they fit.,"Probably just my personal taste, but they feel looser than I would like. They feel more like slacks and less like jeans."
3,Fly is button,"I didn't realize that the fly on these jeans was button. It's a real pain to fasten and unfasten. Other than that , they're okay."
5,excellent!,"excellent! 100% recommended. materials, workmanship and superior design. excellent value for profit. I am very satisfied with the product pu"
5,"Levi's 501 Jeans, Dimemsional Rigid",Levi's 501 Jeans are the best looking and best fitting jeans that can be bought. This particular pair is made of soft material that makes the jeans completely comfortable the first wearing. These jeans are fun to wear and are one of my very favorite jeans. They give me the look I desire. I am completely satisfied like I have been with other Levi's purchased over the years.
3,ok jeans,My son really likes these jeans although I think they are poor quality for the price. I am lucky if they last him a year before falling apart. He is 18 so he is past the age of roughing up his clothes. They are just made poorly. But he likes the way they fit.
5,great item!!!!,These Levis are a great buy!!! Reasonably priced and excellent quality!! The shipping was very fast!!!! My son loves them and is very satisfied which leaves me greatly pleased with this product!!! Thanks!!
3,Smaller than a 32,"I've bought men's jeans in a size 30-34 depending on how I would like them to fit. I bought a 32 because I wanted them to be a little loose but not have that fully relaxed look. Maybe I don't remember how 501's fit but these are more like a 30 and won't fit over my thighs. My goal is to lose weight...lol, but I didn't want these to be tight jeans so I'm a bit disappointed."
1,They are NOT real Levi's,THESE ARE NOT REAL LEVIS. THEY ARE MADE IN EGYPT AND DO NOT FIT PROPERLY. THE MATERIAL IS NOT THE SAME AS THE MATERIAL YOU BUY IN STORES. DONT BE FOOLED.
2,Did they change the thigh fit??,"I love 501 and 527 Jeans... However, I feel like recently Levi's has changed the fit around the thigh area. I measured them to old pair I had and it's almost an inch difference in the thigh area.. Not sure if I am the only one who experienced this?"
1,junk,"i wish i could send mine back,no quality,all wrinkled when it comes out of the dryer,its just junk,and expensive for made in mexico...never again...also the size was very large on me,it felt more like a relaxed fit more than a regular fit..."
3,Good but not very good!,"The right leg of the jeans spins for around 45 degrees, I don't know whether it is this particular jeans' fault or it is 501 series' fault, because I have another 501 Original, the right leg of that jeans also spins for around 45 degrees."
4,These Jeans fit me best,"There are so many jeans nowadays. And each brand has a blinding array of ""fits"". These good old 501s with their slightly-inconvenient button-fly are the best-looking jeans on a middle-aged body I've found. Gonna keep 'em and wear 'em a whole lot."
3,"""Original"" Levis disappoint","These Levis 501 are black. After two months of washing, any damp cloth will still pick up black dye. Also, the right leg has been cut and or stitched on a bias, so that the seam runs in a spiral down my right leg. The seam on the left leg runs properly down the side. Further, they fit oddly - bagging under my butt and tight in the thigh. Something is odd and not right about them."
2,amazing amount of shrinkage,"Levi's Men's 501 Original FitI have worn Levi jeans for about 30 years. I have never had any even come close to the amount of shrinkage as in the pair of Levi's that I purchased through Amazon. I never got to wear them a single time. I tried them on the day that they arrived and they fit perfectly-just the size I ordered. I hung them in my closet for about a month, took them out and ran them through a COLD water wash. I let them tumble in the dryer for about 10 minutes and them line dried the for the rest of the day. I cannot even get them on. I tried to give them to my son who wears a 34 waist ( the jeans are 36 waist) but he can't get them on either. They now measure 33 at the waist. TOTALY RIDICULOUS !!!They are about 2 inches shorter than before they were washed in the cold water. I would usually give Levi jeans a high reccomendation but not these. It must be some wierd fabric from a different supplier."
1,"defective merchandise, not original pairs","good product fades later in the first wash water only made ''it, he was assigned desmasiado color and white'm siertos points."
5,levis color cafe,muy contento por el producto excelente el pedido llego super rapido satisfecho con el vendedor pronto volvere a comprar muchas gracias
4,BUENA COMPRA,"Este Jean Levi's es maquilado en México, obviamente para nada se compara con la calidad del Levi's fabricado en Colombia, resultó una buena compra por el precio, sin embargo prefiero los de Colombia."
4,Satisfecho con mi compra,Satisfecho con esta compra. Solo hubo algo inesperado: los pantalones en lugar de zipper o cremallera en la pretina vienen con broches metalicos los que a mi gusto son poco practicos.
1,Negative review,I did not know the Levis had buttons for the fly closure instead of a zipper. I hate buttons for a fly closure. Because of the button closure the pants do not fit correctly across the front of my body and through the seat of the pants.The pants are ill fitting in other ways as well. I have never in my life had a pair of pants feel so unconfortable. Rest assured I will never buy another pair of Levis by way of Amazon .It is beyond any and all reason that someone would put buttons instead of a zipper for a fly closure .....Truely STUPID I Would give these pants no stars if you had a zero stars rating.......
1,worse purchase from amazon. Ordered my size it is under-size. Cannot use. Wrong sizing.,This article is useless to me. My money is wasted The sizing is wrong. Order was my right size but it is under sized by the manufacturer. Just dumped in my box. Lost money. Need to return but takes too much pains. I am too busy now. Rating is zero. not even the one star indicated
1,Advertisement did not make property of jeans clead,"To my shock, instead of heaving a zipper, these jeans have buttons. The buttons are not easy to reach or close, and the description of the item makes no mentions of them. I am extremely disappointed in this product, and really should return it."
4,Nice,It good for the price.. didnt now it had bottoms instead of zip. but works for me! also a gift for my dad and he was pleased
3,"Good product, but...","Looks very nice, but i think it's not the size in the label, maybe one or two numbers less than others tan i have."
2,Well made;,I have been wearing the Levi's brand for over 30 years and they have changed very little in this time other than going from being made in the USA and the price has changed but the quality is still there.
1,Total dissapointment,"The pair that I receive did not fill, did not look, did not fit like any other pair of 501s I ever had. The fabric felt thin and flimsy, the stitching was awful and, the jeans were way larger than the other 501s that I have in what suppose to be the same size. I guess that's what happens when company moves the manufacturing to some place where the workers are paid a dollar a day. Better quality jeans can be found in a $5 bin in any shop in Chinatown."
2,Wear out in a matter of months,I have been wearing Levi's 501 jeans for literally half a century and the quality of the fabric has gone downhill to the point where a pair now lasts me less than a year before tears appear. I know that the stone wash type are actually tumbled with rocks and are not going to wear very long but I do expect the standard jeans to last a lot longer than a matter of weeks before having holes in the jeans from the fabric having worn thin. Dislike paying 10x as much and getting 1/10 the wear of the Levi's of the past.
3,"Levi's are not made in America anymore,","hence the reduced quality of the merchandise. I had to suffer through one set of Levi's because I assumed they were the heavyweight indigo I was used to, but was unpleasantly surprised to find permanent wrinkles across the groin area that were a 'style' I was not expecting nor had any reason to unless I held a magnifying glass to the pictures. Hindsight and all that I finally got indigo but as I said they weren't nearly as sturdy as previous American-made Levis and really fell short of Lee jeans and their fine quality. If only Lee made button jeans...Levi's Men's 501 Jean"
3,"I can't believe I am giving Levis 501's a 3 star rating, but it is all they deserve.","I always have 2 or 3 pairs of Levis 501s and they have been the pole star of jeans since I was a kid. But this version of the 501s is a bit lighter, the studs are kind of washed out brown instead of coppery and the cloth itself looks cheap. The older Levis had a very dense weave, with a tiny pattern of interlaced blue and white threads that you couldn't see unless you got fairly close. But it was a solid looking jean. The new 501s have a kind of cheap looking thread stripe to them, similar to inexpensive knock off jeans. Too bad, Levis used to be rock solid in just about every way."
2,not original or the quality control is a mess,"i just receive 2 pair of pants same size, diferent made country and everyone has diferent leg sizes up to 2 inches less each other. this is completly unacceptable for a 50$ branded pants."
1,smaller than the blue jeans,"I just bought the khaki pants and I`m surprissed of the size of the pants, I ordered a 34 but the pants looks like a 32. Really a bad experience"
1,These are NOT REAL LEVIS,"These are knockoffs! The material is different and the stitching is a different color from all my other Levis. They look reasonably close, but are not near the quality of Levi's."
1,They shrunk about 2 sizes,"After washing and drying this jeans ; they shrunk about 2 or 4 sizes, they don't fit now.!!! waste of money, I am guessing this are not original levis"
1,Levi's 501 review,If you don't want a 5 Button Fly don't buy. Never mentioned a Button Fly in the description. Material very light not the old levi's I grew up with at all.
2,used to be good,The original 501's were tops but now days just overpriced pants. Go with lee for better value and Costco brand has held up well.
1,levi's jeans,I been wearing Levi's jeans for 40 year's but the quality is no good any more now that they are all imported their simply junk
2,Size problem again,Levi's jeans in the last two years have become very unreliable in meeting size (waist and length) specifications. Those I received were two inches longerthan the size indicated on the jeans. Others have nowtold me they have encountered similar problems. Too badfor a once very sturdy and reliable product.
4,Almost the same as always,I've always like 501s but I'm thinking that Levi has cut corners/costs and gone to a lighter weight fabric so they wear out faster.
4,"Go Blue, Colors aren't the same fit","I love 501's and have worn them for many years now. However, I'm finding that weather it comes from the store or amazon, if you get colors other than one of the ""stonewash"" colors, the fit is very different. They tend to be too tight/stiff and the material is not as comfortable. However, getting stonewash leaves a very consistent fit and material. So go blue."
4,501,501 button fly strait leg...An American classic..forget 150.00 for a pair of jeans. The only designer I need is from house of Levi's
5,Can't go wrong with Levis,"If you know your size, and you had a Levis in the past, you can't go wrong when buying a new pair.Recommended!"
1,OLD PANTS,THE PANTS RECEIVED LOOKED OLD AND USED. WHERE THEY HAD BEEN FOLDED HAD THE FADED LINE MARK AND THE NAME TAG WAS WORN OUT.
3,Shipping,"Jeans themselves are good. But the shipping costs too much. I know I am a foreign buyer, but when the shipping costs more than products, don't you think it's ridiculous & ironic ?"
2,Too many negatives,Count me in as a potential customer who gets turned away by way too many negative reviews. If this Levi's product store is a fake Amazon should remove it asap. Else if it stays on then it's obviously REAL Levi's. In that case let all customers vote with their wallet.Levi's is out of my mind now. I'm going for other quality upstart denims.
3,perfect color - size not correct,"I bought this pair based on a size of 36, and the size is wrong. it is written 36, but these can't be 36. i believe it is labeled wrong.color however, as it was described exactly."
1,The size doesn't match,"Like others, I found these to be smaller than sized. I ordered other pants in the same size (Levi's Dockers) and they fit fine.Fortunately, Amazon makes returns very easy."
5,Great Jeans!,"The wash is very nice, they fit great, and are quite comfy! Not much more you can ask for from jeans!"
2,Poor quality,The jeans look great but the crotch seam developed a tear with normal use. Not the same 501's they used to be.
1,Poor Quality,"Once again Levi has let me down, had not worn them for years becuase they quickly wore out or torn just off the seam in the crotch. Purchased a new pair a few weeks back to give them a try again, and once again in 2 weeks they have torn...Cant find a good quality rugged jean anymore, esp made in the USA...."
2,Fit off,"Got these for my 16yo son and had to return them because They were extremely tight and. He is 5 8"" and about 165lbs. For some reason these pants did not work for him. He normally is. 30x32 fit..."
1,Levi's not what they used to be.,"I've been wearing Levi's for 30 years so I didn't feel like I was taking a risk by ordering them online. I bought 31 inch waist and tried them on, couldn't even button them. I then tried on an old pair of 30 inch waist jeans and they were tight but I could button them. So... I took a tape measure and measured them, they're less than 30"". I've read this situation has become a common problem with Levi's but it had never happened to me. Since most of the stores I shop at now carry Lee's and since I can no longer trust Levi's sizing... I've bought my last pair of Levi's."
2,"Levi's Men's 501 Straight Leg Jean, Blue Mist","This is my 5th pair Levi`s jeans and for first time I`m not satisfied.Quality of the material is Ok but manufacturing of the product is inadequate, the stitching comes a loose way too often. Thus making the pants none wearable."
3,Nice jeans,Color is like appears on the web. Something strange with the size because it is longer and wider than other 38x34 jeans.
1,Levi's 501 bought with Amazon: poorest quality,"I bought the black Levi's 501 four months ago in the correct size, didn't wear them a lot, washed them twice or three times, and now they are two sizes smaller in the waist and I can throw them away."
2,Wasn't too happy,My brother wasn't too satisfied with these 501's. There is something about the fabric that just doesn't feel right. They don't feel like traditional jeans and the difference is a lot like what they did with New Coke a few years ago. New? Yes. Bad? Yes also.
2,Material failed,"I ordered 501 original fit in medium stonewash. In fewer than six months, the crotch material had come out. I could no longer wear them and returned them minus a stocking fee of about $8.The good part is Amazon's ability to take back a failure such as this. I grew up in 501s and have always found them to be comfortable and tough. Now, they're just comfortable.The seams did not come apart. It was the fabric. Originally, fabric was so thick that they were hard to wear before being washed. Even after washing, I could stretch the pants vertically and hold them from the bottom. The fabric was that heavy. Now, it's like gauze in comparison.I'm going to try once more and hope for the best.Levi -- get attuned to quality and stop selling junk."
1,Levi's decline,I can't believe how Levi's is running the brand into the ground. The quality of the 501's has declined to all time lows. The denim is very thin and the waistband rolls. The fit is inconsistent from pair to pair. I would be surprised if these jeans last a year.
1,Poor quality,"The quality of clothing in general seems to have drastically declined in recent years, and Levi's jeans seems to be one of the worst offenders. This is the last time I'm buying these."
5,Levi 501 Jeans,The jeans were up to par like they always are. It was easier to find them on the Web than in the stores.
2,Not sure about these,I'm going to go along with what others have said and say that the quality of these jeans is much different than what you'll find in a physical store. They are thinner. I have seen differences in Levis jeans over the years by looking at where they are made on the label. These are made in Mexico. I would not buy these again.
1,I hate it,"The crutch has to button up. It is tighter than it looks, that is, the crutch is too high. Totally dislike it"
5,Great wash and cut,"I was timid about buying pants online but with free returns I had nothing to lose and I am glad I got these. You can never fo go wrong with the classic levis 501 cut. It will always look good, on anyone. The wash on these (""Clean rigid"") was just as in the picture and I like it a lot. They fit just as expected as well. Given that we get the full selection of washes and sizes, Amazon also has a good price on these. I would definitely buy my next 501s pair here again."
3,New brand of 501's?,"Well, back in the days I could get a pair of soft 501's but not so fortunate these days. The quality of the denim is terrible as it is hard and scratchy. I was also disappointed in the color - light stone-wash used to be almost pale blue but nowadays it's medium blue which I didn't really want. Not sure why I keep ordering them except I'm attached to 501's and have worn them for 35 years or more."
2,out of aligment,I expected the product to have passed Q.C but to my disappointment the stitching alignment of the pair doesn't match.Guess products like this are best worn and tried for satisfaction before purchase.
5,Over 50 and still like 501's,"The nice thing about the school district I work for is that teachers don't have a dress code. I dress casual. Levi's 501's are the most comfortable jeans that I've found. I dress comfortable. So I dress really casual. I don't think I've ever worn out any other pair of jeans at work. But I go through about two pair of Levi's a year. Worn out in this case are small holes so the jeans are able to be recycled for work on the farm. Again, comfort is a premium. Should you wear Levi's 501's? It's all a matter of taste. I have it, and I must say that when I used to do office work, my bosses didn't. I had to work overtime to gain Casual Day Certificates to wear 501's. Really, it was worth it. Did I say this yet? They are comfortable."
1,Amazon didn't take responsibility for incorrect web page,"I was very unhappy with this purchase; I will no longer purchase clothes from Amazon. I was looking for a pair of shrink to fit jeans in my hard-to-find size. The Amazon web page that came up advertised Levi's 501 shrink-to-fit jeans in the size, and I proceeded to select a pair. The receipt mentioned Levi's 501s, but didn't specifically say shrink-to-fit. I wasn't sure if it should and I trusted the receipt would actually reflect what the web page advertised. The jeans arrived in a couple days, but were not shrink-to-fit. The return process was relatively easy and painless, which is why I will continue to buy non-clothes items from Amazon. However, the online resolution screen haughtily claimed that since the purchasing error was my fault, Amazon would not pay for the shipping. There are too many unknowns in fit when purchasing clothes from potentially erroneous web sites for me to repeat this exercise."
1,pantalonlevis,"pesima calidad. mejor es la imitacion que hay en venezuela y no dicho tanto por mi persona, sino por conocedores de este tipo de pantalones, unos eran mas largo que otros en la talla 36x32"
3,Would prefer larger size.,"Levis are great pants. My job requires whites. However I need a 36 length, not amazons fault but be sure to check size availability when you order.Amazon rules!!"
1,the fabric is too stiff hard pants I ordered two similar but this is not like the other,the fabric is too stiff hard pants I ordered two similar but this is not like the other.I hate it
5,Excellent quality jeans!!!!,"I read several other reviews that complained that the 501 jeans they received were thin material, with only 5 belt loops. Not sure where they got their jeans, but I have been purchasing Levi 501's for over 50 years, and the quality I received was as good as any pair I have ever purchased. I am wearing them today! Dale"
2,iffy buy,i bought these jeans for a costume and i thought they would be good but when received product it appeared to be warn already and returned previously owned and would expect a $45 pair of jeans to be new because you can buy them in the store of 50 something. I liked the jeans a lot and they are great jeans but wouldnt buy online again. BE CAREFUL! Wanted to return them and Amazon took them back no problem with no return shipping.
5,Levi's 501,"There'w nothing like Levi's. I'been wearing t hem for pretty near 70 years. And, even though I've got a slight bit of ffat in the middle, the 502's still fit me fine. They last me four or five years, then the holes appear, making them exacdtly what my son likes to wear, then I give them to himn."
5,Great vendor.,"The product got home in time, perfect conditions and for a great price! totally recomended, and the quality of these jeans is amazing. so i would love to keep buying these kinds of products."
3,"it is ok, but...","The picture shows a pair of jeans that looks like to be washed on the legs but the one I received are all of a dark blue, not like the one I saw in the item's descritpion"
5,Levi 501 Original Fit,"I love my 501's.... isn't that how the saying goes?These have to be the best fitting, most comfortable jeans ever made....I've tried several brands of jeans ~ from CK to no name brands.... and nothing wears like a pair of LEVI jeans. Within the levi jean line, I've tried different styles from the 550, 517, 505, and 501.... and the 501 are the ticket!Well made, and great fitting on the ""average"" body...."
2,levis 501 34x30,"ordered 34wx30L they were 4 inches too long ,they were not 30 L if these were factory seconds with irregular fabric they should have stated i will not order from this company again"
3,levis,"Pants came in on time fit somewhat good for me they are to tight through the crotch area, and there is a gap in the back also, otherwise they are nice looking and great for traveling to the beach...."
3,OK for a jeans,"After 7 months of wearing the pair, they turn out OK although the material is thinner than expected.I have only 2 problems:1. The color is not exactly the same as in the picture (clean fume). But I liked it anyways.2. The leg is too loose, I had to take it to my tailor to have it narrowed."
4,"I like the original 501s, not the rigid ones.","Beware of the RIGID models, those are not original 501s. they shrink when washed (it doesn't matter if you use cold or hot water). By the way, the Straight Leg Jean, Green Goblin is RIGID too... Im giving 4 stars to the NON-RIGID ones."
2,"Looks like a ""defect"" pair",Ever try on a pair of levis and the fly is stitched incorrectly or the seam on the leg twists around to the front? Those are these jeans. The ones I would've seen in a store and then grabbed a different pair.
3,Levi's goal to be like the others...,"While the jeans I got fit well and were comfortable, I was disappointed that the material was so thin. i have some older 501's that are still hanging in there because the material was thicker and more substantial. I think Levi's marking just thinks of copying the competition and not the traditional Levi buyer will keep their market share.... Sorry to say I will now look at other jeans makers and just think of Levi's as another lower option."
1,not impressed,"Whatever these jeans are, they're not jeans. Levis should be ashamed of themselves for marketing such an inferior product.Mine are going back to Levis and I will be getting my money back. The worst ever."
3,ok,no nos gusto mucho queriamos con sierre no con botones en la cremayera esa fue la falla no podemos hacer nada mas que ponernos
4,Great jeans 1 CON only :( QC,"I bought 2 pairs of levis, same model and size, made in the same country (Mexico), the only difference was the color, one on black and one on medium-stonewash, my surprise was that they did not have the same measurements at all. The black one fitted perfectly on waist and on legs, but the m-stonewash was just wider in waist and short on legs... I had to do some stitching work on them in order to make them fit as the black one, for the short problem I had to live with that ;). What I want to express is that it was a failure of their Quality Control, they should be exactly the same, but they are not.PD: One more difference was that the black one was also ""waterless"" made. At least it is what was written on the cartoon label."
3,Thinner denim,Yet another company using thinner denim.I bought a pair of Wranglers and a pair of Levis in the same order. BOTH companies are using thinner denim.
1,NOT 501's!,"Real 501's are made of 14 oz canvas-like material. These ""Iconic Rigid"" jeans are made of some sleazy, much lighter material that takes on a carefully contrived set of wrinkles to make them look like they'd been worn to bed soaking wet and dried out overnight. If you want real 501's stay away from these. I sent mine back right away."
2,Are these really 501's ???,"My husband has other Levis 501's and these new ones are different in the weight of fabric ( light), fit(tighter in the leg and crotch) and color of stiching(white). Also the rivits and buttons are white instead of metal color. They also shrank when washed in cold water and line dried. Are these real Levis 501's or knock off's ?They are made in Mexico, his older ones are made in Colombia and are regular heavy fabric Levi 501 work pants. We are not happy with these pants but have already washed and used them. We would never order them again."
1,material too thin,This is not the same material that Levis have used in the past. way too thin! I returned and will not buy online pants again.
1,"Label says the same size, the fit says otherwise; ever thinning denim","Levi's Men's 501 JeanUntil this week, I had been wearing levis all my life and in recent years was only wearing 501's for all occasions. I buy many different colors for my various activites. Currently I have over 10 pairs that have never been worn because there is no quality control at Levi Strauss. Living out in the country it is too difficult and costs too much to send the items back in to Amazon. The 501's I have were made in Egypt, Mexico, Haiti and other various places. The labels all match in size however some of the jeans are at least a full size smaller at the waist and some of the pairs have the correct waist but very narrow legs. One last issue I have is that the material does not hold up. some of the 501's I bought in recent months rip after wearing them just a few times, some of the buttons come apart."
1,Not department store jeans.,"I normally buy my husband's 501's at the mall but went this route because I was short on time. HUGE mistake. The material is totally different than any pair he owns and there are a lot of little differences that make me think these are knock offs. These jeans went straight to the work jeans pile because they are just weird in fit, color everything. They were also not much cheaper than I would have paid from a real retailer. I will not buy 501's again unless they are from trusted chain retail store."
1,poor product quality,"Damage to the fabric, which is rotten. No wash over two or three times and it breaks.Made in haiti"
1,not what I asked for,"With regard to the size and quality of the product it was dissapointing, it was not the size I asked for. I asked for two different models and one was ok but the Blue mist is to small to fit in. I would like my money back as I can not use the product"
1,Its a fake,"This product is not original. Bad quality, poor color. Made in Egypt whitout license from Levis. Dont waist your money whit this"
1,no es el color que pedi,I made this purchase by leaving me guar product photo which says new metal colored and looks like black aged. I received was a totally different color received was the natural gray. I want my money back.
1,what happened,took 3 days for order to ship.recieved levi jeans...tried them on..fit perfect.put in washer before wearing..cold water wash.put in dryer...low heat.put levi jeans on after washed and dryed.waist 1 inch smaller.lenght 1 1/2 inches shorter.made in hatiti.
3,Blue Green Rigid are SHRINK TO FIT.,"As another reviewer mentioned, which I did not see before purchasing, the blue green rigid are shrink to fit. The description is very vague so there was no way of knowing. It's possible other washes may be the same, however I do know that Rinse is preshrunk. Overall the jeans are fine, but both my husband and I noticed that they arent near as thick and durable as they were a couple years back."
1,Pathetic,"Been Levi's forever. I thought it would be convenient to buy some online...Don't. Save yourself the trouble. The material from the one I got from Amazon's pretty thin. Reminds me of the other jeans I don't care for.I read some comments and said this is Levi's new style...Went to the mall to see if this is true for a comparison. I like the ones in the Mall much better. Now those jeans are the ones I grew up lovin'.Never gonna order levi's form Amazon again. Dickies however I don't mind those as an alternative to the levi's here, but I'd rather just get the levi's from the mall."
1,Worst ever,These pants are the worst Levis I have ever owned. I've been wearing 501's for the past 45 years and these I can hold up to the light an see through the material. I ordered Original 501 Straight leg jeans and they sent me some baggy stone washed jeans. Save you money and get your Levis from a reputable department store!
1,Just not the same,"The pair of 501's that I bought are the exact pair that I have bought several times in the past, this time the size was off, they did not fit, I bought a pair at the store the same day,exact same pair and they fit perfect like the rest of my 501's."
1,501 levi's are phony,"Ive worn 501 levis for forty years I ordered three pair of 501 jeans from pennys. After I recieved them I immediately noticed the poor dye job,the lightness in the denim,and the wierd buttons.These are difinately not like the 501;s i'm used to wearing.I wrote,and spoke to a levi,s rep who stated that I could ship[ them to them,and if they did not meet there specs they would send me replacement jeans,but if it did meet there specs they would keep my jeans.It goes without saying I did not take the chance of loosing my jeans.Now they are in aplastic bag in the corner of my closet,I will not wear them."
5,They are the real thing!,"They are the real thing! This review is for the original fit 501s with button fly, not the shrink to fit ones.I was a bit concerned because some reviews mentioned that the fabric/quality is different. But after unsuccesfully running around to several stores trying to find the correct size and color I figured I had nothing to loose.I had ordered 4 pairs (2 black, 2 dark stonewash) for my husband. He can't tell the difference from the department store bought ones. Once it's time to get new jeans we will definitely order them through Amazon again."
3,Shrink to fit are preshrunk,"I thought the line that says, ""finish yourself"" meant shrink to fit. Evidently it means preshrunk because that is what I received and that is what I am returning!"
3,"wrong ones, oh well not surprised",sent me the wrong ones but i guess they'll do. it shouldnt be that hard to get it right though. at least theyre the right size.
4,The Button-fly is the devil's work....,"First of all, let me say, these jeans fit like a glove, the sizing is excellent, for you big guys out there, you will love them. They make us look great. Now....the dreaded button-fly, this thing is absolutely AWFUL, if you are a big drinker don't do it unless you are wearing rubber underpants because if you are in a hurry to...lets say...evacuate, it ain't gonna happen with button-fly jeans. Other than that the quality is top notch, and you really can't beat this price."
4,Its ok,El producto es bueno aunque no se lo ve igual al de la foto.It's ok. But it's not so similar than the picture.
1,can't ask anyone when a particular jeans will become available,"I'm not sure if it is only me, but somehow I could not ask anyone at amazon about when a particular jeans will become available. All my jeans are Levi's 501s, and among them the color Dust Storm is my favorite. I've been checking for over a month now and 501, dust storm is not available in my size at amazon.com. The more annoying is, there's no information on if and when it will become available. Do I have to come back and check every week to see if a new shipment has arrived???"
2,Levi's 501 Black 32x36,My husband has worn these pants since I met him in 1991. These pants are much smaller than the pants we have purchased in the past. I'm not sure if I'll have to get one or two sizes larger in the waist. The other's started off loose and tightened up a bit as they were laundered. These are so tight I'm afraid to wash them. He can barely get them buttoned. I will need to exchange them for a larger size.
3,"Nice look and fit, but feel like cardboard!","These are nice jeans, great color and fit. The only issue is that they are very, very stiff. The demin fabric is very heavy, so hopefully they will hold up well, but they really feel like they are starched. Even after repeated washing and drying in the dryer, they are extremely rigid and not very comfortable. Hopefully they will loosen up with continued wear."
4,Levi's,"I love the jeans, only issue was I didn't realize I was getting button down and wanted a zipper. Oh well not paying for shipping to correct. Just wont order stuff on-line, too mush of a crap shoot."
5,felicidades por este envio 100 estrellas,"este pantalon se los recomiendo la talla es la que dice , por eso les doy 100 mil estrellas por este pantalon"
5,Levis is a good product as always.,"The jeans are as always well constructed and well made, good material, durable, very nice fit and very good color."
2,size different than in stores,"Nice color, but size is larger than the similar size I would obtain in the store (30x32)This one does not seem to be tailored properlyNice color, though"
3,Didn't fit and wrong kind,I'm not sure how I missed that these were button fly. I thought I did a good job reviewing the details but I ended up not getting the right item. Will be returning.
5,never out of style,"these jeans last forever, they fade nicely and my husband won't wear any other jean. i hope levi's' never stops making them because my sons wear them also. And thank goodness for Amazon because retail stores don't carry 36 x 36."
4,jose Rodriguez,excelente producto quede a gusto con la calidad y la rapidez de la entrega espero poder efectuar mis compras este año con la misma eficiencia.
3,Levi's 501,The 501s fulfill there purpose. They are neither exceptional nor unexceptional. I would say these jeans should be sold to men.
2,bad material,"The blue jean that you sent was damage the fabric, a fabric that looks rotted, cracked, is rather strange in levis product. I would like to know what do i do with it. I took some picture of it, I would like to send i to you, tell me please how i do ittranks.Elizabeth hidalgo"
1,if you had 501s in the 90s,If you have had 501s in the past you will not like the new ones. They are cheaply made the sizes are not consistent plus they changed the in seam stiching and they rip eazy.Sorrt about spelling im sending from my phonw
4,MUY BUENO,NO TUVE NINGUN PROBLEMA CON ESTE PEDIDO LLEGO EN EL MOMENTO Q LO NECESITABA PRONTO PEDIRE OTROS MAS EXELENTE SEVICIO
3,undecided,"Unusual material, pleasant to the touch, but it seems to him to be all stick (especially cat dander).3 stars out of 5 because it does not match the size, and sit oddly (curve seam) on the ass."
1,Hated the fly,"Didn't like the button fly, too many buttons - 5 to be exact. Makes wearing too inconvenient. Wouldn't recommend it."
4,Neat Appearance but tight fit,"I love 501 jeans, they fit just right in all the right places and I prefer button fly to zipper. Note that the polished black is a bit different than the usual black jean (there is a plain black 501 as well). The polished finish produces a shiny, more finished jean look which means that wrinkles are sharper and more noticeable -- the fabric is stiffer than the plain black jean. If that happens, the tried and true technique of spraying the jeans lightly with water, wearing them or giving them a quick press will help.The stiffness of the fabric is part of the clean and neat appearance but unlike other 501s this also seems to reduce the ""give"" in the fabric and makes the fit tighter and slightly uncomfortable at first -- hoping this will work itself out after a few washes."
3,Levi's Men's 501,PRO: The material was as expectedCON: I would have preferred 54x28 which wasn't available. Also the fly had buttons instead of a zipper.
2,Cloth trousers very bad,"It is a very nice pants but its fabric is extremely delicate because shrugged, still taking all expectations in the wash"
4,nice fit,feels very comfortable -not really crazy about the button fly and seems to hold it's size after washing I would definitely buy another pair
3,Levi's Union Blue jean,"I like the color, but here again the inseam is about 2 inches too long (they are inconsistent). Here is the review i wrote for Lee:I am going to buy more Lee now than Levi's. I had never bought Lees until this holiday season. I now have several pairs and they are consistent (so far) in length and quality. i am 6 ft 3 and usually buy 34 x 34. With Levi's sometimes the inseam is slightly too short and other times it is almost 2 inches too long. I have many pairs of Levi's now that i must get hemmed. Plus their quality varies - maybe depending on where they are made. Some pairs seem more like Spandex than Denim. Nevertheless, sometimes i like the colors that Levi's offer so in the future i may buy them again. But mostly now Lees."
5,Best jeans ever.,"I have being wearing 501s since I can remember. They are sturdy, last forever and will always be fashionable, well at least thats what I think."
5,Awesome jeans,"The 501's are a classic fit and ae comfortable to wear. I have not worn jeans in 20 years and with the coexing of many female friends I bought a pair of the 501's. needless to say, not only do they fit well, my lady friends love them on me! Thanks Amazon and Levi's"
2,Defect or fake product,"The jeans arrived with minor defect. The red tab on the back right pocket, usually have ""Levi's"" written on it, but this jeans have nothing. Just a red tab."
3,ok,"Not the best fit, just a normal piece og pants. I used it in Sensation white party where it got quite dirty. Got real stiff after one wash."
2,Watch out,"Heads up on the fit (regular, original, etc) descriptions. Unclear why Levi's felt compelled to alter the fits on these long established styles (501, 505) but they did. What you used to buy is not what you're getting. Couldn't find a notice or explanation on any Levi's site, so you're on your own."
2,Not the right cut,It says levi's 501 but definitely it is not. I always buy levi's with the same size w34 l32 and this one seems like w36 l32. I'm very disappointed.
4,what i expected,these jeans were what i expected in terms of look and fit. no surprises. classic 501's. i do agree with other reviewers that the fabric seems a bit thinner or less stout than i recall from years ago
2,"Like the color, but not the quality!",Poor fabric and semmed longer than the other pants I have beeing the sama size.
1,"The product is not received, could verify if indeed this pant SENT ME CAME AS NO","Levi's Men's 501 Jean, Green, 32X32 The product is not received, could verify if indeed this pant SENT ME CAME AS NO"
1,noel,sonhechos en haiti no sirven los made in mexico si son buenos me engañaron no pense que era asi
5,Excellent fit and quality,"They are a bit pricy, but made in USA and fits the way they should. I would recommed at least trying a pair."
3,Second best fitting jeans I've found,Faded Glory Jeans fit me better. It's difficult to find these in the 33 x 33 which is what I wear. This is a great experience I've had buying jeans of ebay. They are in great condition and easier to find on there than in stores. I would like to find darker ones and find ones that fit even better than Faded Glory. The FG fit much better most noticeably in the seat. see my video where i tell more and what I do to prep new jeans before i wear them and b4 and after each wash at youtube b29349 jeans.
1,Look terrible after washing,"I bought these pants and wore them twice. They really looked good until I washed them! I washed them on the delicate cycle with some of my other sensitive clothing, and they came out looking terrible. They are irreparably wrinkled and there is marbling all over. No I didn't use any sort of bleach....Not even ironing gets the wrinkles out. Unfortunately I can't sent them back. Will never by these again."
5,Nice!,"After wearing the denim jeans once, they immediately became my favorite pair of jeans. I'm planning on buying several more pairs and the fit is perfect!!"
2,Missed some specifications,"I must admit that the ordering process on Amazon is very easy and user friendly. My only problem with the product (which was returned without hassle whatsoever) was that the pants were button fly and not zipper fly and that wasn't stated on the detail page. Again, the item was returnnd without hassle and I have replaced the product with exactly what I had origianlly intended to order."
1,Really awful,"I ordered two pairs of 501s via the Internet recently. I was shocked. One pair was so small I can't button them. Another was way oversized. Also got a pair of 514s and they were of such sheer fabric, I can't imagine them lasting more than a year, even with infrequent wearing.I guess the message is to make the trek to the mall to buy Levi's. There, you can try on 40 pairs to find one that's right.It's really disappointing."
4,Nice pair of jeans for the price,"These jeans seem to fit true to size for me opposed to what other reviews have said (33x30). Denim is a little light and the hardware seems cheaper than I remember it being years ago, but overall a good pair of jeans for the price."
2,"Extremely Low Rise, and Not 'Original' Fit.","I ordered these on the grounds that I needed a taller size. I loved the color, but they came up only midway up my buttcrack. When I did the 'crouch down' test they revealed much, much more. The legs and fit indicated they were not original fitting as the leg stayed the same width all the way down the leg. All in all, what I ordered was completely different from what I thought I was ordering. If you're a tall guy like me, don't get them.Other than that, I'm giving them two stars rather than one for nice quality and color."
2,Fit is too variable.,"I've been wearing 501s since the 1970s. I know the fit, and it suits my body type. I recently ordered 3 pair in different colors. The fabric and fit of each pair were different. Only one pair fit. This particular pair had a much higher rise in the waist than the so-called traditional fit. It's getting returned."
4,I am in love with them...,I bought these just on a whim because I have not had a REAL true pair of button down Levi's since I was in high school. Now I am a 50 year old woman and still can wear this style. My husband loves them on me too!!! They were a tad stiff at first and after washing and letting them air dry they are fitting like a glove. I am so glad they still make some old classics!
3,Runs small - button fly was not in the description,"My son is a toothpick but even these jeans were too tight and I had to exchange for a different style. This style runs small so you may want to consider going up a size in the waist. Ordered via mobile so the description was limited and I didn't know they were button-fly. Everything else was fine, inseam, quality, color as described."
1,Very pumpy,"I always buy 501, but this time is the first time I get crapy ones. They are very pumpy in front and wider than they should be. I wouldn't buy Levi's again from Amazon as the seller. I bought before from Mayc's via Amazon, and they were how they should be."
1,PRICES FOR TOP BRANDS,Looked at the 501 jeans and compared to another top brand at a store that sells a lot of everything. The other top brand was under sixteen dollars. It pays to shop and to compare.
1,20% lighter :),"This pair of jeans weighs only 22oz in W31-L34 more than 20% lighter than the one I bought two years ago in a retail store (28oz). I wonder whether Levi's is selling a different product through online channels or whether they have decreased the quality of the material for all 501s. 501 is sold as 501 ""original"", unfortunate that it is not true any more. Levi's, please bring our 501 Original back."
3,too long!!,Quality of the material is good but I bought a 34 Lenght and even though it is written as such they are at least a 36!
3,Levi Quality keeps slipping,"This is a nice enough pair of jeans, no problems with cut, style, fit. They're 501s, just what you expect. However, it's notable how the overall quality of 501s is slipping -- fewer belt loops makes for a less comfortable fit. I've noticed that the last couple of pairs purchased now require that I reverse the front pockets to cut off all the loose threads and tangles or else everything I stick in my pockets gets all tangled up and tears.I'm probably making the switch to Land's End for jeans. They still have some that are reasonably sturdy. I don't like this price for this quality. I can go to Walmart and get this quality for $10."
1,Really not the usual Levi's!!!,"I had to return them. Completely different from my usual Levi's when it comes to size and fabric. By far too long and wide, not to talk of the poor material used... I want my old Levi's back!!!"
3,"Not so ""pre-shrunk""","The jeans looked nice and fit well when my husband first put them on. But, after a wash and a dry, they shrank a bunch and he is still trying to stretch them back out. If ordering again, I would order slightly bigger to allow for shrinking, or I would avoid putting the proper size in the drier."
3,MUCH TIGHTER than other 501s.,"I bought two pairs of 501s. Both are 29""x34"", but fit very differently. These shrank so much that they are unwearable in public. They feel like 27""x30""."
3,"Be careful with ""shrink to fit"" 501's","Watch out--amazon's website describes 2 completely different lines of 501 jeans as ""shrink to fit."" The true old-style shrink to fit 501's are only available in limited solid colors, including Indigo--the only right color :) There are also a line of 501 jeans that have the original fit, but are prewashed, available in numerous colors including stonewashed, but do not shrink after washing. Unfortunately the description of these prewashed ""original fit"" 501's erroneously has the phrase ""shrink to fit"" in the product description. Don't be fooled like I was..."
1,Not Levi's normal good quality product.,"When they use the description rigid.......they mean stiff as a board - and not pre-shrunk! They didn't shrink too much around the waist but after the first washing, we had to scrap - the inseam shrunk by 4 inches!!"
2,EL PANTALON NO ES LO QUE ESPERABA,"The request was for three jeans, all with the same size or measurements, but this particular one did not adjust to the body as the other two that I noticed is that they are manufactured in different plants or at least is what is indicated on the label inside the truth is they got to wait for six weeks to lose one of the jean"
1,Broke my heart,"I have worn 501 Levi's all of my 60 years and I will never again buy what those Levi's people are selling as ""traditional 501"" Levi's! I was sooo disappointed when I received them, my heart broke! At first, I was going to return them but then I decided to give them to charity or the next bag-person I saw! That material does not come close to anything I have ever witnessed as tried and True Blue Levi's material that won the West! I'm quite sure the wretched Levi's company won't miss me as a customer, but I will never buy another pair for the rest of my life. I will simply patch the real ones I have from the years Levi's were Made in America out of American materials and the only jeans I wore!"
1,Should be a warning label on the 501s,"There should be a warning label on the 501s-- these are not for everybody. The button fly is extremely awkward and difficult to work, especially if you are in a hurry or have the slightest problem manipulating too big objects through too tiny holes in stiff fabric. This is an awful product for anyone who is overweight, has arthritis, poor circulation in the hands, possesses pudgy fingers or has wrist problems. I would also recommend staying away from this product if you have bladder problems or are drinking heavily."
1,NOT TRUE TO SIZE,Way too small. tight fit. did not want a button fly. perhaps I messed it but didn't see anything about a button fly
4,Size of Jeans Levis,"Hi Sir!I have bought a Levis Jeans 501. But I found down it's length longer than I like. Now I intend to buy 2 more Jeans like that, But I wonder your Jeans 501 product have sive W: 32 and L: 26. Let me know,wait for your respond.Thanks very much!Besr regard!"
4,excellent,"made in egypt,my wife says i look 10 pounds smaller,only problem with me is the button fly,zipper would have been geater seeing that im a diabetic and all and i got to pee frequently."
1,I can't believe it's designed for men!!!,"I am a big fan of amazon as I buy things from Amazon and ship it to China! ^_^Most of my previous purchases were good except one wrong photo used jacket which caused me a totally different jacket! now this Levi's Jeans is the second bad thing, even worse! I have never seen a Jean with 4 buttons instread of a zip chain in that position when all men need to go to toilet! imagine it! if you are very anxious to wash room, but having to deal with several buttons before you could succeed to release your burdon! crazy!! I even thought this were desinged for woman and I got a wrong Jean at the beginning when I opened the package. anyway it's not possible to return it as it's in China now. I dare not buy any Jeans via internet in future. but this design really doesn't sound reasonable, right?!"
3,Muy ajustado,Verifiquen las tallas en una tienda cerca de ustedes asi sabran que modelo y talla se ajusta a ustedes muy buena calidad A1
1,Rags,"Don't be as stupid as the Levi Corporation. Although Levi jeans manufactured in the 1950's sell for thousands of dollars in New York, the company has relentlessly degraded the product for 40 years now, trading on their name alone. They are actually so stupid as to try to compete with the slaves in a Chinese concentration camp by accepting products manufactured in Africa and South America. The original rivets are gone, their ""denim"" fabric is the worst quality; all seams fray, especially cuffs; belt loops fall apart; and the only appearance achieved is shabby tissue. These fools do not have the intelligence to realize that people would pay hundreds of dollars for jeans produced on the design, material, and workmanship of the 1940's. Stop living in the past."
2,Sizes are smaller,we used to buy this jeans from stores and this time we decided to order online but the sizes were smaller. Please be careful with sizes everything else is usual. Order one size bigger
1,Not the Denim I expected...,"I bought these 501's excited that I had found some in my size. I am a larger person, but the jeans were loose fitting on me which was fine as I usually order a size or two up to allow for shrinkage. The first washing they went from Black to a streaked washed denim look, I was ok with that, but should have suspected something wasn't quite right. After only 3 washes and on the 4th wearing the denim let go in the groin when I was sitting down. Something that hasn't happened in other pants I've owned util I've worn them for 4-5 years of hard use. I was not pleased at all and won't be buying the black 501's again anytime soon. I have other regular Levi's that seem to hold up just fine, but reading some of the reviews apparently I'm not the only guy who felt a breeze where they weren't expecting it, in a very short time after wearing these jeans..."
2,w8ing for this item,"yo compre dos pantalones y solo me enviaron uno quiero saber que paso con esto, espero una pronta respuesta por favor! (ya recibi el jean blanco falta el blue jean medium stonewash)/////I purchase two pairs of pants and only sent me one I want to know what happened with this, I expect a prompt response please! (received only the white jean,lack the medium blue stonewash denim)"
1,Insufficient Product Info,"I ordered two Levis Jeans. One arrived looking completely different, since they had the wrong photo (they corrected that meanwhile). The other one came as a shrink-to-fit instead of a regular 501 as ordered. When I opened the additional online information today, ""shrink to fit"" appeared. The most important information appeared only after an additional click. These are two major management mistakes at your Levis store! And after the first cold washing with a special product for black clothes, the color started to disappear... The Jeans were a christmas present for somebody in Germany, so there are in Germany right now, otherwise I would have returned them."
2,Go to JC Penny,"These were poorly made, light material and just HUGE! The front pockets sagged, the color was odd and my wife commented that she could get in there with me (not a bad thing). I have 3 other pair of 501's in the house that are the same size I ordered. These are pretty big. The other issue is they have redesigned the change pocket and made it lots bigger. So big it is nearly useless because it tucks under your belt if you wear a wide one.Now the comment about going to Penny's. The last pair I bought there (501's are the only thing I buy there) seemed to be heavier material. Washed 501's seem to have a lot of size variance, so trying them on is good. Second, the darker material blue ones fade more normally in the wash. These medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by 20 somethings. Almost looks dirty.I've worn these things for 40 years. I'll keep on wearing them but I'm not happy.These went back though."
1,Wrong Style...,"I'm very happy that I receieved my order within 4 days, the size is right but unfortunately I order Levi's Original fit but I received Levi's Straight fit same size and same color. I'm still waiting for the 3 more i expect same issue with them..."
3,I thought I purchased shrink-to-fit 501s. I received pre-shrunk with a faded Levi label.,I thought my purchase was for shrink-to-fit black 501s. The jeans I received were pre-shrunk. I'm buying from Levi direct next time.
1,These are NOT Levi 501 jeans!!,"WTH?!? Total rip-off! Bought two pairs of these ""jeans"" and they shrunk about two sizes and I'm not sure what the material is but it isn't what use to be comfy Levi 501 cloth! If you are into the wrinkled look these jeans are for you... it is proving to be absolutely impossible to get the massive wrinkles out of these pants.I am very disappointed with this purchase and am feeling VERY cheated by the Levi Strauss Company."
3,Comentario,vino con un detalle en una de las botas (raya-dura) de resto el color es bonito y la tela es gruesa
2,Wrong Jean,I have ordered The 501 Original Fit Jeans Style #0050114xx and I have received the 501 Original Shrink-to-Fit Jeans Style #0050111xx. In order the color is wonderful.
5,just what i was expecting,"the usual quality of Levi's; great fit, great materials. i'm a usual levi's costumer and i never have been disappointed"
1,fit,they fit snug and they are two hours from my home now. they were a gift . i also bought another brand the same size and they fit fine
2,Watch out for...,"I'd love to give this stove a better rating. This was a great stove right up until the plastic cap on the regulator broke. The whole stove is made of stainless steel and brass, but a little cap on the regulator is plastic. What were they thinking?? The cap breaking renders the stove useless. I do like the stove, so I have ordered a replacement regulator. Just be careful, and be protective of that little plastic cap. Also be aware that parts are not readily available. Coleman stove parts can be found in hardware and sports stores far more easily."
1,"Great until it breaks. NOW, ITS JUNK. Stick with Coleman products instead.","It was great stove for about two years, until the last trip we took. The plastic cap on the regulator assembly broke and there are no replacement parts available.An old internet add, for the regulator, showed a price of $38.95 when it was available, and for an additional $10 you could buy a new Coleman product instead.Don't waste you money on Brinkmann products, they are inferior and in the end more costly. Lesson learned, buy a Coleman and accept no substitutes. This seems to be a common problem with these stoves and Brinkmann's fix was to discontinue the product and abandon their customers."
2,same old same old same old,"i own the larger (costco?) version of this stove, it has the same regulator mentioned in multiple reviews, with the same result, it self destructs with amazing speed...................while parts of this stove may be superior in other ways the regulator problems far out weigh any benefits.............save your money and buy something else, this product is inferior.buckfuffalo"
2,Stove is great - until the gas regulator breaks and can't be replaced,"Honestly, I loved this stove for the two years that it worked.It provides more heat than my old trusty Coleman, but isn't as unweildy as the huge stove they sell at Costco.Then the plastic cap on the regulator broke. And Brinkmann is no help in getting it replaced.If all these guys make is equpment like this, you'd think they would have a regulator that worked at least half as long as a Coleman. But nope - my coleman regulator still works fine after 25+ years.Too bad. It was a great stove for it's very short lifespan. Still trying to get a new regulator though. Hope springs eternal."
1,Awful Movie,"I love slasher films, and have seen my fair share of low budget films, but this one is as cheesy as cheesy gets. Awful low budget film. I payed way way too much for it, and I gave it away it was so terrible. I could never charge anyone for this film. AWFUL"
2,Don't Waste Money on a Blu-Ray,"If you like slasher movies, you will enjoy this one. The only problem here is that the quality of the print is so poor that any extra money spent on a Blu-Ray disc is wasted. If you want to add this movie to your collection, buy the DVD because the Blu-Ray is not going to get you any better quality (certainly not 1080P quality)."
2,Not the uncut version!,"This is an ok low-budget slasher from the early eighties which takes place in an abandoned dorm building, has who-done-it plot, and co-stars Daphne Zuniga from The Initiation, Space Balls and Sure Thing, and also has some good, bloody deaths! Only problem is the good stuff is cut and the only way you can see this cheese fully un- cut & un-censored,, you'll have to stick with the VHS WHICH IS UNCUT !!!"
4,Enjoyable 80's slasher flick!,"Christmas Break has begun at a town university, 4 friends are preparing to tear down an old dorm that hasn't been used for a while. A homicidal maniac is killing them with their pals one by bloody one with anyone he can get his hands on.Gory and enjoyable 80's slasher flick that co-stars Spaceballs actress Daphne Zuniga, sure there is little much plot in this movie but what sells this one is the cool kill sequences. There's bloody violence from drillings to industrial steaming, the film is a bit slow at times and too much like ""Halloween"" and ""Black Christmas"" at times but the film works nicely for slasher fans.This Blu-Ray/DVD Combo has alright picture and fair sound despite it's age and the extras include the film presented in it's uncensored director's cut, audio commentary, isolated score, interviews and trailers."
3,Great art - not a howto book,"The photographs and many diagrams in this book (most of the book in fact is gorgeous glossy photos of the different joints described) expose and beautifully illustrate the Japanese people's many intricate forms of joinery. The author explains the basic concept behind each joint but does not provide details on how to make the cuts that form it. The joints illustrated here are those most commonly used by Japanese ""carpenters"" and provide an excellent basic overview of what the joints look like and how they fit together. Readers looking for a how-to book will prefer ""The Complete Japanese Joinery"" by Hideo Sato and Yasua Nakahara."
3,Coffee table book,"This book is good for a coffee table display book since it has descriptions of several various joints and nice black&white photos. But if you are planning to create the joints for yourself, you will need a different book since there are no details given about the creation of each joint."
4,an architectural perspective,traditional japanese joinery is a fascinating mix of art and architecture. this book focus on the architectural point of view therefore may be helpful for either students and practitioners.
5,"dreamy, artsy, ride...","This film is unlike anything I've ever seen. You can feel the love behind the filmmakers' efforts, and the result is often very quirky, magical, and nostalgic. This could end up becoming a cult classic film to Indie music fans or American foreign film enthusiasts."
4,"Safe and secure, though lacking back support","We've had this carrier for 4 months, and our baby has enjoyed it very much. When she was a newborn, putting her in it facing in would instantly stop fussing and crying. Now that she holds her head up well, we face her outward and she loves seeing the world.PROS--Well-made, exceptional safety features, easy to use and put baby in/out aloneCONS--Poor back support; your back will hurt after about 30 minutes unless your baby is tinyAll in all, a good buy for the money and it's helped us out."
4,jeep 2 in 1carrier,An essential item for those with infants especially during travel.It was and still is of great help to me
5,Now you can travel,"Reading through Zikman's book is like crossing the most beautiful countries and landscapes without any effort. The author's knowledge and wisdom is touching, makes sense, and goes straight to your heart and mind. No traveler should leave home without this little pocket-sized friend."
3,config call manager,Book is ok maybe a little better could have a lot more pictured info of step by step examples ie it takes you thru numerous steps than shows a pictured example of what the last step should look like it would be much better if @ each step they would show what you would see on the screen
4,A Little Slice of Pop Heaven,"Yorkville, Illinois pop darlings Oval-Teen release their first full-length album on MOC Records, following a lengthy career of singles, compilation tracks and cassettes. This summery collection of hand-claps, organ riffs and bittersweet lyrics revels in the joys of home recording and record collecting. If the Waxwings, Sloan and Teenage Fanclub are to your liking, you're sure to enjoy these songs of love and longing. The best thing about this album is that it manages to be sweet without being cloying. Lovely."
4,A lo-fi goldmine!,"This is a great example of lo-fi American indiepop. It is crudely recorded but full of excellent melodies. I would recommend that the uninitiated start with their retrospective ""Yorkville,IL"" on Bi-Fi records. With 55 songs there's way more bang for your buck!"
3,"modern anthology, maybe a little misleading?","not to say that this book isnt worth the time to look thru, because it definately has some interesting perspectives and great photographs to go along with it. but this isnt what i was expecting from this book. . . for what little i had found on it, there were mentions of how ancient societies used different piercing to show manhood and as rites of passage. so i was expecting that it was going to be more of a history, and showing social evolution of how what are typical body piercings today started as a sign of royality. alas, it is not. if anyone knows a book that is more along those lines of a history, please let me know!anyway, this book is okay. if youre looking for a kind of photo documentary of modern piercings (most of which are people from europe) then id would tell you to buy this book. because thats exactly what it is."
5,A Brilliant Surprise!,"What a wonderful surprise this book is. Spence may be an ""aw shucks"" country lawyer on his T.V. appearances but ""Of Murder And Madness"" reveals him to be a deep thinker and a talented writer. Here, he parallels his own life with that of a murderer he defends. It is really most extraordinary. A good read and an informative discussion of the insanity defense. Luckily it's still in print. What a clever combination of legal thriller and autobiography. Read it. You really won't be sorry."
1,Meanders badly,"Hardly worth one star.Spence is unable to stick to the story, to stay with the storyline. The way some people like to hear themselves talk, Spence likes to read what he writes. The book could be OK but he meanders off on tangents about prostitutes, Mexicans, and a lot of things that have little to do with the storyline."
5,Redman puts others to shame!,"I bought this cd, put it in, and listen to the whold thing without stopping for a second. This is the only cd I can listen to without skipping any tracks. Redman is sick, his lyrics are dope, amazing how he puts them all together. To all you other whack rappers out there listen to Red ""you remind me of school on a Sunday...no class!"""
1,it's really cool,"this album has good beets, and it's got cool lyrics, bas yaaney i dunno, it should'nt have 4 stares waitsted on it, so don't feel bad red, u'r cool"
5,TOO STRONG FOR YOU TO MISS IT!,"The best Redman album there is. I still love this album today. The lyrics are very good, even till now! The beats keep you moving nonstop. The thing I love the most about this album are the lyrics, cause there are plenty of them. If you love Red's lyrics with some of the best beats Erick Sermon has ever laid down, buy this album. This album has many good songs with high playback value. One of my top ten."
1,cracked case,"Came with other discs sent from Amazon directly. The other discs were in good condition, but case of muddy waters from third party was cracked in several places. Could not refund because it was not from Amazon. Cracked Christmas gift . :-("
3,redman will blow you out muddy water,I was raking leaves and bang this on my ipod. It is a hip hop head's pal. You can tell that Redman is a real steward of the game.
5,flawless masterpiece,"this album, is raw hardcore rap. redman was the best on this alum. lyrics were off the hook. every single song is a slap! production was funky but grimey!"
4,Redman Drops A Hot Album,"Throughout his career, Redman has never got the respect that he really deserves. He has always been overshadowed by Method Man, and sure, Meth is a very good emcee, but Redman can spit just as well, and his many solid albums have proved that. Muddy Waters demonstrates Redman's ability to make you both drop your jaw when he spits some ill lines, and also to laugh. Red has a unique style that can only really be described as funky. The beats on this album are tight, and Red complements them with good lyrics, aand the guests also drop some nice verses. The only problem I have with this album is the large amount of skits. Some of them are pretty funny, but if he took all of them off the album I wouldn't have any complaints.My 3 Favorite Tracks:Rock The SpotSmoke BuddahPick It Up"
4,GREAT TOY FOR CHILD OR ADULT!,"The only reason I did not give the Roboraptor a 5 star rating is because of the usage of batteries with this item. I have found the best thing to buy is rechargeable AA batteries that they have available now or you can buy lithium batteries which are really expensive but last much longer then regular alkaline batteries. The dinosaur is one of the best presents I have ever gotten but my cocker spaniel hates it! The guard mode on the dinosaur is the best and funniest with the dog! I read it will play tug of war but I have not figured out how to do that yet, but eventually I hope to get my dog to play tug of war with it!"
5,A Kid's review,"Like a real Dinosaur Roboraptor is really cool and fun, I love playing with Roboraptor I just build buildings and then I put My Dino there, then I put Him into hunting mode. But if I want Him to brake down buildings I just move Him to walk on the buildings or stepping on them. it's like a T-rex rampage I like that it's cool."
5,Fantastic illustrations,This book gives a brief history of the dresses. The illustrations are quite good. He actually manages to capture Diana very well in his presentation. If you want to see the dresses that were at the Charity Auction this is definately the one to get. The book is printed on high quality paper so you are sure to enjoy this one for a long time.
5,The downlow,"It is obvious that a great deal of time and effort was spent in laying down the tracks in this CD. As any DJ can tell you, mixing Platipus is no easy task. Scott Stubbs has done a masterful job in putting this CD together. It isn't merely an album that is listened to--it's a journey that is taken. The highs are titillatingly high, the lows are unsettlingly low, and the overall feeling is one of triumph. At no point is the artistic integrity of any track compromised. It truly is a work of art. I recommend it in good faith to anyone who can appreciate music."
2,dont waste the green,"I would like to start off by saying ..Dont believe the hype..this album was a complete disapointment to me..nothing but mind numbing busted beats with no real quality to back them up. I have to admitt that there are two good tracks on this cd 5, and 7, but mostly a waist of time and is now laying in the closet with my mom's A-track tapes. so if you feel like buying a CD for two pretty good songs then this is the one for you, if not get transport or altered state of conciousness."
2,Old and dusty,"If you are a Frank Miller fan who came into his comics after Ronin and Dark Knight Returns don't expect this to be the same. What you see here is a pulp comic in true formula style. It hints at what Miller was to become but it never shows us. This is important. The comic itself is entertaining in the same way that any comic is. But the art is dull (slightly more black than the comics of the time), the color is poorly done and the scripts are banal. This is only slightly better than you're average comic. Nothing truly risky. No surpirse though considering that Frank was just a kid with no respect at the time. If you don't own Sin City or 300 or the new Dark Knight, then get those first. This is for hard core Frank Miller fans who want to see his roots, not for someone who expects the standard that he set with his later comics."
4,I loved this book,"I use this book very often for learning how to grow and care for my herbs and also for finding them in the wild. It also has information about the use and preparation of various herbs for teas, poultices, salves and oils."
5,Yeah!,"I'm so excited about the new Chronicle book. Try it, it's a great way to learn more about main streets and back roads. Plus, it will be a great holiday gift."
4,"Nice, but Vol 1 MUCH better","More spotty than volume 1, there are some real gems here. However, there are several songs I just plain filter.Nevertheless, the intimacy of the recording is still wonderful. Buy volume 1 first, then this one."
3,Written for Middle School Students,"Large selection of vocabulary words. Contains good tips about how to defferentiate between similar sounding or meaning words. Was expecting something on a college level, which it was not."
3,NOT as pictured,"The set we received is not as pictured on amazon. The zip cord does not have the rescue pack on it - it is a piece of yellow plastic without much ""zip"" - gotta admit I'm disappointed. The set is worth 20 bucks though..."
3,My daughter loved it but it broke after the 2 days!,"My daughter really loved playing with this rescue center, however the helicopter won't spin anymore when you push the nest. She is usually not rough with her toys and I didn't see how it broke, but after only two days of playing with it, it's a shame. She still loves to play with all the other features of the rescue center and has a blast with the zip cord. She just manually spins the helicopter now. She has the Dora house too and loves going back and forth with Dora and Diego adventures, so I don't regret buying this product."
4,Fair quality and lots of fun,"My almost 3 year old looooooves this toy (she'd give it 100 stars I'm sure). She has played with it every day for 2 months. From our experience we haven't had a lot of problems with the rescue center, but I have removed the zip cord, vine, and the 2 smaller animals as I also have a little one that likes to play with it too."
1,falls apart too easily,"My three year old couldn't wait for this toy and he and his older and younger siblings do enjoy playing with it. However, for the price, I expected it to 'snap' into place better because as is, it is in pieces all over the floor the marjority of the time."
2,Somewhat disappointed,I thought that I was getting a new product but it came used. I'm not sure how I even came about looking at used products and I wanted this for my son for christmas. Some of the pieces were missing and it came in a marlboro light box. I don't mind buying used items but not for $38.
4,Super fun but not too durable,"This Diego Rescue Center is very fun for my kids to play with. My 2 1/2 and 4 year old love it. They play rescue adventures and I love the imaginative play that comes with this house. The only problem I have is that it's not very durable. It's wobbles on it's ""stilts"" that attach it to the base and the top floor (the part that folds out) falls off all the time. I probably have to put it on 5 times everytime they play with it. I really don't think they are being too rough - they just lean on the floor while they are playing with it and it pops off. I'm afraid it will eventually break - it's held on with only 2 tabs - and with the constant popping off I'm sure one or both of the tabs will eventually give.Overall, I think it's a fun toy with lots of replay value. But I wish it was a bit more kid-friendly on the durability side - especially for the money."
3,Not Super Impressed,"My 5 year old insisted on asking Santa for this. We thought he'd be bored with it, and he is. My 3 year daughter enjoys it more, so I would stay in the 2-3.5 age range. My biggest complaint, though, is the quality of this toy. The door does not stay shut, the legs are not secured well enough in the base, and the elevator is IMPOSSIBLE to use. When you attempt to use it, either the legs pull out of the base or you pull so hard everything falls off the elevator or out of the treehouse. My own personal pet peeve is the noise. Every toy that makes noise should have a volume switch!! This does have an on/off switch, but it would be nice to turn the volume down without shutting it off completely. The Deigo figure is nice and solid and fits nicely in the helicopter and cart. Around Christmas this item was $36. Certainly not worth that much! Maybe worth $15-20 if you're buying for a young child and are aware of the design problems."
3,My son loves it but I dont!,"My 3 yr old absolutly loves Diego and Dora so of course this item was #1 on his birthday list. It was very easy to put together.....thus making it very easy to take apart! I can't tell you how many times a day I have to put this back together! It's become quite annoying! The locks that are on it (to snap the legs into the base) do not lock at all, you do hear a snap but can pull them right out.As far as my child...he loves it! He can play with it all day."
3,Ok toy if on sale,"We bought this toy on sale. I did not mind paying $[...] but I would have been disappointed at the regular price of $[...]. It was very easy to put together but does need an adult to move it from room to room since it can come apart easy. I am disappointed with the ""zip line"". It is really a yellow plastic wand looking like a cord. It is not string nor does it look like the item in the pictures. The zip cord works best if it sits on the tree house attached to the tent and does not move. Or as my son found out last night a wonderful Harry potter Wand. Needless to say my son who is 4 loves this item and has not stopped playing with it."
2,bored by the end of the day,This was the only toy that my 5 year old asked for for Christmas. She continuously reminded me every time she saw it in a store or in an ad. She has always enjoyed Diego but by the end of Christmas day she was telling us that she was already bored with it and really hasn't touched it since.
3,Waste of Money,"We bought this toy for our 3 and 4 year old boys and they loved it at first. It falls apart very easily, and after only about a month, the helicopter wouldn't spin anymore. [...]. This toy is definitely not worth the money."
3,It's alright...,The kids really get into playing with this toy however it is a pain. The folding flap keeps snapping off and the zipcord does not stay in place. The set comes apart completely by just lifting it up off the ground. It's not very well constructed for the amount of money we paid for it. Unless you don't mind putting toys together repeatedly I wouldn't recommend this toy especially for $40.
3,Good thing the kids like it,"Not worth the $40 paid, but it was on Santa's list. And, no matter what I think of it, the kids, 6 and 4, LOVE it.My issues with it? The zip ""cord"" is not what you would think but rather a hard plastic line from the front of the playset you attatch to the tent. You can't use it without the tent. So, the kids just don't use it and move the tent around as they want. Also, when you load the helicopter on the swingbar, the whole thing dips down. And the ""elevator"" does not move freely. I have to manipulate it for the kids to make it go up and down.On the plus side, I think it's put together well and holds up to the amount they move it around. We haven't had any issues with legs coming out or anything like that. And I think they put a nice amount of smaller items, animals, in the kit to make it worth while. If it were easier to use, I add more stars just for the fact the kids love it."
3,Son loves it! But quality is not great.,"My almost 3 yr old son LOVES it! He has played with is several times since putting it together last night and is playing with it now.I have the same complaints as everyone else, the quality of the construction of the toy is less than desirable. The swinging door does not stay shut, the zip cord comes off when Diego slides down it, Diego is extremely hard to get into the ""rescue pack"" to slide down, the extension piece on the top level does not sit straight, the elevator is hard to move up and down, and the ""legs"" do not snap in and stay in place... so everytime you try to move the elevator and have to use force the entire top comes off since the legs pop out. It also would have been nice if it came with Alicia or at least gave you the option of buying an expansion pack that includes her. [...]"
4,2006 Great Pick,This is a great toy I got this for my 2 year old and my 3 year old and I can't say enough. They played with this toy for hours on Christmas not in one shot but through out the day. They were so happy with it. Great asseccories. Great durability. Great priced at $ 30 or $40. Worth it!
4,"A bit cheap for the price, but a favorite among my son and his friends","This toy is consistently a favorite with my son and all of his friends (boys and girls). They always end up settling in with this one for an extended period of time and dreaming up adventure after adventure for Diego. The problem I have with it, is that it comes apart fairly easily. The helicopter falls of with just a brush of the hand. The zip line configuration is a bit unstable and falls apart if you put much pressure on it. Still, the kids seem to willingly get past all of that and still love to play with it by the hour. So that makes it a winner in my book. Three and a half stars would be my true rating of this toy."
4,we got this last year for about $20 from amazon and love it,"My son still plays with this a year later even though I keep eyeballing it to make room for this years holiday gifts. This one has to stay. Still, right now there is a seller asking $70. you will be disappointed at that price. This is a GREAT $20 toy."
5,GO DIEGO GO!,My son loves this toy still! he got it for Christmas and played for hours! He still does . With all the toys he has this is probably his favorite. Love it HIGHLY recommend
3,Thought provoking travel through time,"Synchronicity, by Vin D'Angelo, is a little book with a big heart. Both poignant and thought provoking, this love story explores some of the possibilities of re-incarnation and the reason to re-live a life with others from our soul group. D'Angelo juxtaposes current events with life in the future to show how the soul carries memories, feelings and beliefs into each life experience. It is an invitation to appreciate the opportunities in our own present day actions."
3,"Better In The 80's, But Still Good","I loved LL in the 80's and have always been a fan but this greatest hits collection was hard to listen to at times. Everything sounds sooo old and outdated. Songs like ''I Can't Live Without My Radio'', ''I'm Bad'' and the worst offender ''I Need Love'' sound corny and cheesy as hell 20 years later. His 90's hits really saved the day. I still enjoy listening to ''Mama Said Knock You Out'', ''Back Seat'', and '' Hey Lover''. Overall, this collection is nice if you want to take a walk down memory lane."
3,Pretty Good......But,"One of LL's strongest suits is that he could take on all comers in the rap game, step his game up whenever and crush 'em (see Canibus). However, one diss record in particular got left of this compilation which was more deserving than ""Jack The Ripper"", and that was ""Till The Break of Dawn"" originally on the House Party 2 soundtrack. That record pretty muched sealed Kool Moe Dee's fate and put Ice-T in his place for even thinking he had enough lyrical skill to battle LL. Of course, since this LP came out in '97, I guess we'll have to wait for the song 4,3,2,1 as well as the ultimate diss that ruined Canibus's brief career on his G.O.A.T. LP. However, the remix for ""Rock the Bells"" is one of the most vicious singles ever released in hip hop and should have been put on this cd as well as the remix for ""Doin it"". I guess you can't have everything I suppose. But it's an okay compilation."
3,some of the songs are pretty good,"Alright this isn't one of my more played cd's but some of the songs are ok. This cd has some songs that are classic ll cool j. I'm not a big fan of his but some songs i like including Hey Lover, Loungin, and Mama said Knock You Out. If you've been a ll cool j fan from beginning to present then this is a cd that you might want to pick up, but if not i don't recommend this cd. I have respect for ll as a pioneer but i think he could rap about more things."
2,2 stars for the music.....5+ for his body,"I wrote a similar review on 50 cent. I think LL is a talented rapper, even though I really don't like rap. He sings about other things besides guns and drugs. He has also managed to keep himself out of trouble, which you have to respect. He deserves all of his success. I look forward to more releases from him, because I know he will be in at least one video shirtless. WOW this man is beautiful. So he gets 5 stars for his hotness!!!!"
2,ugh. i wish i hadn't bought this...,"...mainly because i think less of LL as a person now, not necessarily as a rapper...what a letdown. i ordered this for 75 cents (no joke) off half.com after watching ll cool j preach his way through deep blue sea. i got it because i remembered ""mama said knock you out"" and ""going back to cali"", and i remember liking them, but jeez, man, those are the only two tracks worth listening to on this entire friggin' cd. and this is the greatest hits? most upsetting of all is that j comes off as a huge jerk...the lyrics here are even more chauvinistic and disrespectful than i would have expected from a more typical street-rapper. some of the songs are scarcely listenable the message is so embarrassing. the good news is, of course, that ""knock you out"" is even more badass than i remember."
3,"its not the best of, but can beggars be choosers?","these recordings are from the period of the early 1970s pbs series, which while enjoyable did not represent the true best of kfo. some of them are enjoyable, some merely serviceable, but one would wish that rca would re-release the classic recordings made in the 1950s, which were still available as recently as the 70s on the camden label.if you are a fan of the kids, you will want to own this collection; if you are only exploring this -- the greatest ""children's"" show of television's golden age, you might do better to hunt down a friend with access to the real stuff."
1,IN ONE WORD: NO!,"Baby Boomers still remember Kukla, Fran and Ollie as stars of the early days of TV. This is the first in a series (!) of soundtracks from the show, in which the show's writer/creatorBurr Tillstrom sings in various characters' voices. Here they are. And there we go, looking for a way out."
3,Not enough pictures,"While the information in this book is very interesting, we had hoped for a few more pictures of the Tuscan countryside."
2,Hill Towns of Italy,"The book is in good condition, and provides the information I need. It came very quickly. BUT -- it was supposed to be a paperback book and it is hardback. I wanted paperback so that I could take it with me when I travel!"
3,Hoped for a better ending...,"If I could give this another half star, I would; it's a solid 3.5.The author was sooo authentic with the feelings of despair, rage, emptiness that a marriage on the rocks experiences. I know, I've felt those emotions myself.But after taking us through the depths of their despair, I was hoping the author would let us soar through the clouds a little with the couple by the end of the story. There was so much time spent on their problems, I was just hoping to be able to see them living together happily for a little while. I know the novel ended with a feeling of hope, but I wanted to see more of that in action.I also found the flashbacks a little distracting. Some of them were good, but I skipped several."
5,Professional Impression,These covers enahance the image of my services to my clients. I have used these covers for years and my clients routinely comment on them.
3,Not much about the care for hammies...,"This is a very thin book, so there is only a little of everything in it. The section, which is more detailed is the one on the different types of dwarf hamsters. It will not be a good book for first-time dwarf hamsters owners. I will only recommend this to those who are already familiar with dwarf hamsters and want an additional read."
2,Disappointing,This book seems to be lacking general overview information. It's more for breeders than the everyday pet owner.
3,Generally adequate information and well-taken pictures.,"This book 's content is fairly adequate such that it provides the basic information a new hamster keeper should acquire. The photographs, though, are marvellous. Looking forward to more updated information about the various breeds of dwarf hamsters in Chris' upcoming new dwarf hamster book. In all, good job!"
2,Good Beginners Book,"This is a good beginners book, but some of the material is out of date. Experienced hamster owners will find it dull."
4,I thought that this book was very well written,This book was very good and answered a lot of my questoins about my little hammy! I recomend it to anyone.
5,Awesome cappucinos! Big machine!,"I also thought the Lello Ariete machine looked great, but since my old espresso machine was kaput, decided not to wait. Amazon delivered this machine the day after I ordered it and it's works great! Lots of thoughtful touches -- the removable reservoir, frothing wand that screws off for cleaning and a little red thing that pops up to tell you that you need to empty the basin.Very sturdy machine - heavy grate and filter holder. Nothing like the cheapo machine I had before, and neither is the coffee. Making a cappucino is a bit time consuming and complex but once you get the system down, it's well worth it. And I'm sure it's the same as other genuine espresso makers.My only complaint -- this is a big sucker! They don't give dimensions on Amazon or even the DeLonghi website, so here they are: 14.5 inches high and 10-11 inches in diameter (it's sort of round, but the reservoir sticks out a bit. It dwarfs our regular coffee maker."
4,Great Machine! Three Years of Use,"I've used my machine for about three years now. It makes great espresso. My father in law bought the same one after he used mine. The removable water reservoir is extremely practical. My shots come out nice and hot with a beautiful froth on them every time. We have really enjoyed this machine!My one and only problem with it is that it leaks a little bit of water. I need to wipe up a little bit of water after each time i use it. It really isn't a big deal, but it is a little bit of a bother. I didn't notice this problem with any of the other reviewers, but my father in law's machine does the same exact thing.Overall, I would totally recommend this machine whole-heartedly. It is a great buy and saves a ton of $$ because my coffee is less expensive and better tasting than buying it anywhere else."
2,Disappointed,"I read great reviews for this machine, was impressed with the features but ended up being disappointed. The boiler doesn't heat up and the espresso comes out luke warm. I've followed the preheating instructions but the coffee comes out warm and not hot."
4,Still going after 4.5 years,"This espresso machine is a workhorse. I use it every morning and have been doing so for the past 4.5 years. I haven't had a single problem during that time. The machine doesn't make the world's most amazing espresso, but it is solid and was worth the price. Definitely will buy another De'Longhi once this one kicks the bucket."
5,I love these hose!,"I bought these pantyhose because of my job and because of my husband. They aren't like most pantyhose ... not too binding where it matters and they don't seem to run easily. If you have to wear pantyhose as much as I do, and if you have a husband/boyfriend/person that likes you wearing them (LOL), these are the way to go."
3,Hue pantyhose,"I received my nproduct very quickly and was advised of every step along the delivery process. Unfortunately once I tried out the product it did not completely meet my expectations. I have used Calvin Klein pantyhose with 20 denier in the past, and they were very sturdy while stil very elegant. The Hue pantyhose ripped much faster, both on the hose as well as along the seem by the panty line. I was looking for a sheer to waist with control/support and 20 denier (which Calvin Klein unfortunately no longer manufatures). While this hose is nicely clear to waist and has support, it has a disappointingly short life span."
2,Sizes run small,"I love pantyhose, but I don't love these. I'd much rather wear L'eggs Sheer Energy sheer to waist. The sizes run small, and they are not very durable."
1,These were the wrong type,I really wanted the light control kind. It was too much trouble to exchange theses.My husband thought the girl on the package was hot.
4,Easy to use!,"I am a Seattleite and a serious coffee consumer. I recently purchased this machine at Starbucks for $999.99 and it was worth every penny.I was at first worried that it would be too cumbersome and difficult to be a worthwhile investment. I was very happy to find that it as as easy as brewing a pot of coffee to use. The digital screen tells you when to add more coffee, water or to empty the grounds bin. It rinses intself during the heating process (which you can program to be automatic)and during shut off. You really only have to presteam and post to keep the nozzle clear. Beans are easiest to use. Preground is an option, but it can only load enough for two brews. Place your cups on top for warming on the preset option -- what a joy to wake up to on a rainy morning.Purchase a taller stainless steamer and a thermometer and you'll be all set.January 2010 - repairs were expensive ($350) whe the central interior compenent misaligned itself. And it took months to get it back."
4,its good at amazon,"was looking for this for some time , it palayed well no problems. bought dvds before, they have played well , not afraid to buy them again."
3,Glorious Trainwreck,"I can't take this mess seriously, but it's some of the best unintentional comedy ever written. The first 12 chapters got progressively more absurd, and I can't wait to see how far this goes. I know that I probably have better things to spend my money on, and Kelly is certainly going to make a pile of money off this release, but it's a glorious trainwreck that I can't help but stare at.I'm certainly not in the 'R.Kelly is the greatest artist that ever lived', but Trapped In The Closet is the genius of a madman."
5,very good,this is a very good movie/song for R. Kelly. Can't wait for 24 of the next chapter to come out.
1,Hated it!,"The first five minutes had so much offensive language that I turned it off and have not watched it yet. I gave it to a friend who wanted to see it and she also said that the language and content was foul. Not like the first one. Hated it!P.S. You have no provision for rating an item ""0"""
1,Anyone who thinks this is good is a moron,"Sorry but R Kelly sucks. Hasnt done anything good since his callabo with Biggie in 97'. That callabo with Snoop recently wasnt bad either. But other than that, he just sucks. I was listening to Toucher and Rich radio show and they played snippets of it, none of us or the DJs had any idea what the hell he was talking about. Unless you just buy it to make fun of it, I don't see how anyone can truly like this garbage."
5,How exciting is this?!,"VERY!!! I've owned the album since 1971 and it's always been one of my favorites, so when I saw it finally come out on CD I just had to get it. I definitely have my favorites: Final Analysis, Rock Odyssey and Great Divide, but all the tunes are solid and great to listen to.All my other thoughts have already been said by others, so, if you're a Don Ellis fan, BUY THIS CD!"
4,Great Follow Up,"I loved the first book and was not disappointed with its follow up...strong men, sassy women...it's a good read."
3,Special side dishes,"3 1/2You gotta hand it to the 'Lab. For an early compilation with b-sides to get such critical success, something must have been truly right with their deceptively simple suave synthesis. Many songs on here can't compare with what extended elegance further afforded, though the underlying fervor for hypnosis rarely felt more vital."
5,"La lune est libre, je crois.","This album is worth the purchase just for ""Lo Boob Oscillator"" which is my favorite song of all-time. Poppy, keyboardy, fun. The rest of the album is excellent as well."
3,"Very Typical, Still a good series overall","Okay, let talk formulas: WWII; hero brit pilot from the nobility, brash american hot-shot pilot, both in the RAF and both in love with the same woman. Enter Kat Winslow. I think she had more character when she was a spunky tomboy preteen. Ahem, back to formula - Kat Winslow = missionary/ nurse. She works hard and is selfless to a fault and falls in love the end thank you very much for buying.All that cynicalness said, it's a decent read. If you're a diehard Winslow fan you'll still have a pleasant time reading, and many people (self included) don't know the difference b/t a bull and steer so the using interchangably thing won't phase 'em."
4,"Excellent instruction, ANNOYING filming!","I love this DVD as much as Sera's previous one, and have to agree with other reviewers that this disc is not for absolute beginners and has great conditioning drills.However, I do not understand why they had to film it with so many students in such a small space, for me it is horribly distracting. If they really wanted to show different body shapes etc, they could have rotated the students Sera breaks down moves with (make each time 3 different ones) instead of cramming all of them in one frame. You cant really see what the ones in back row doing anyway, just arms and legs.Come on, guys, DO NOT DO THIS. I really want to see the instructor clearly not in a crowd. It is somewhat...intimidating... Not a quiet home practice but a whole bunch of people.... LOLLoved Sera's performances! She's such a beautiful dancer and teacher!"
4,"Fast paced, high energy and empowering","At first I was really thrown off by the speed at which the moves are thrust upon you. There is no slow motion explanation of moves; just an army of curves gyrating at breakneck speeds. It grew on me though, and over time as I became more familiar with the sequences I was able to relax and thoroughly enjoy myself. The breakdown section for arm positions is one of the most comprehensive I've seen yet, and the meditation section that always makes me feel amazing. I gave this a 4 only because there is little to no mention of proper posture, which is essential to bellydance."
3,"Absolutely beautiful book - but for parents with older children, not babies","This book is beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, well done, has thoughtful questions. But it's more a book for when your children are older and you are looking back on your memories of their first years. Some of the questions can't be answered until your child is several years old. I'm looking for a newborn record book and so returned this one and will order Land of Milk & Honey's First Five Years book. Also, while this book is very pretty and nice, it doesn't have a lot of writing space for recording memories. You could only fit a few sentences in the lines, so if you're a big writer you might need a bigger book."
2,Doesn't feel that great,These things looked like they'd feel good but they're a big disappointment really. Annoying squeek as you roll them. And... can a non-sex product look more phallic than this? Embarrassing but funny!
2,"TOC applied to sales -- great idea, weak presentation","The authors clearly understand how Eli Goldratt's Theory of Constraints can be applied to sales management. However, they do a poor job of imitating the novelization that Goldratt engagingly offered in ""The Goal"".The authors have constructed a plot that provides an adequate expositional framework, but the main character's facile, unexplored results may not prove persuasive to the uninitiated. Coupled with abrupt story transitions, uneven pacing and sloppy editing (missing verbs, oddly-constructed quotes), the result demonstrates that authors can understand their subject without having the tools to explain it well.Get ""The Cash Machine"" for the useful information it contains, but don't expect ""The Goal""."
2,Too analytical/scholarly and misses the point,"My main problem with this book is that Clark is too analytical. The book reads like a thesis. She often ""intellectulizes"" her way too a point that is either obvious or that she could have gotten to in a lot less time and with more straight forward language. Don't get me wrong - she does have some insights into Nietzsche but they are few and far between. I actually thought that her chapter on the Eternal Recurrence was the best in the whole book. Overall, not that great a read."
1,"Got really boring, really fast","I hate simulation racing games, so when one day I decided to rent Ridge Racer 64, I wasn't expecting anything good. Wow, what a surprise. It got boring after about ten or fifteen minutes, there are only three tracks in all, which is horrible for a racing game. Save your money, buy F-Zero X, Mario Kart 64, or Diddy Kong. Don't even bother thiking or even renting this turkey."
3,"Not the best racing game, but is fun","I bought this game and finished it within 2 days. There are only 3 tracks (with 9 modes) so you end up playing the 3 tracks over and over until you finish on expert. Then the credits display. After that, you get awarded the same 3 tracks but be able to drive them the other way. Wow, now that's an award. Ok, so the cars are fun to earn and mess with, and the graphics are good, but this game is short lived."
3,for whom are studying video as a second ...,"The first 9 chapters of the book are too basic for students who want to find a job in video developments. But, it will be easy for some professors to teach a course. The later chapters include some good contents, but they are not really related to the early chapters. The second part of book should be a seperate book -- could be a good one. Also, more video application issues should be discussed -- I mean REAL applications -- since the title of the book is ""... communications"". It is quite weak in the ""communications"", e.g. file format, sync.,RTP,..."
2,ok book very short infomation could be better,I got this book thinking it would go deeper into the world of insects and how they can survive with their defenses but each of the 90+ chapters only covers just a little bit of what each insect can do and gives a brief example. The info is great but very limited and I was dispointed this book is not worth the $30.00 i paid.
3,Super Chiller???????????????????,"Do you want a really scary ghost story?............Well this isnt it.But if you want a good story,then this is a good one.A new boy is in town and cannot get why he feels he has been here b4,when surely he never has.Whose memories is he experiencing?Will you figure out the mystery?"
5,Incredibly informative,"I always find that a person's ideas come across so much better when backed by credible research, and Mr. Locksley has done an excellent job of that. Incredibly informative, and also technically no errors that I can see. Very good job, an excellent Introduction."
2,definitely different,This video is definitely Different from the other Wiggles videos. The animation is a little wierd with the Really Big Heads. My 4-yr-old did not really like it.
5,"Make sure you have a ""play only"" CD player","The movie was fun, I remember it as a child so it was actually funny. I sent it back twice because I never saw the ""CD play only"" clause on the back"
5,Love Movies About Spookie Houses!,"I recorded this on a VCR tape in the late '80's and when I lookedat this DVD, I noticed a scene at the beginningnot in my TV copy.In fact this DVD has about 12 minutes more and most of it is this scene.They tour her new house, which makes it seem more like a real housethan a set, because of more detail than usual.It couldn't be that unusually shaped tower house! (Benidict Castle, still there)It has a staircase in a scene to match that shape.Cassie, in missing her house, says ""It's my own private amusement park"",in more extra scenes, at an amusement park, riding on a gondola lift.I like Connie Stevens in this.I tell ya man, it's magic!"
4,Two On A Guillotine,"Feel this is one movie I would let young teens watch as it is a good clean movie. Nothing like today's where they are filled with filthy language and scenes and 'blood and guts', bombs and assault rifles.Remebered this movie from my younger years, particularly one scene --remember the entire theatre just exploding in one scream and the results of that particular date. Enjoyed being able to go back in time to that one very wonderful night. Only wish my date of that evening were here to enjoy this movie with me."
3,Good But Not Great,"If you're an Avengers fan, you'll want this book for the pictures. If you just want one book, then get the Complete Avengers."
2,This book could have been better.,"I'm going to have to agree with the other readers. This book had excellent pictures. But the writing was not up to par. The other Avenger books are far more interesting. Still, if you collect all Avenger memorabilia, you might as well add this book to your collection."
3,Pleasant Background Music,"Not quite dance - not quite New Age - somewhere in between lies a pleasant collection of ""classical"" Middle Eastern sounds blended to sound modern. It's innocuous but not particularly compelling. It's pleasant background music for a store or restaurant to set the mood - or it's a soundtrack for a TV movie. Pleasant but not particulary noteworthy."
4,A Classic,"I was given this book when I was very young and it sat on my shelf for years before I became interested enough to read it. I wish I had picked it up sooner! But then perhaps I needed to mature more before I could appreciate it. I was utterly fascinated (I read this in my teens) and even the historical ""textbook"" portions captivated me. I love to learn history from fiction, and this did an excellent job - Dutch history and culture came alive. I have re-read it several times since, and no Disney move can do justice to the book. (Well, I don't believe any movie can really do justice to a book.) The characters are real and we easily empathize with them, the adventure is exciting and the climax of the race does not disappoint. It should be in every child's library."
5,Delight for all ages,"I remembers Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates as one of my favorite childhood books and wanted to try it again. It was as delightful in my middle age as when I was seven years old. The forward about Mary Mapes Dodge, when she lived and how she came to write, was an added pleasure. The facts about Holland blended with the touching story of Hans and his family make it a nearly perfect read. My 70-something mother-in-law finished the book in a day and liked it as well. To read it is to feel like you are flying down the ice yourself."
2,Hans Brinker is an OK book,"I liked this book but it is slow going. It has little plot at the beginning but get more ""exciting"" near the end. It has a lot of dutch words which are hard to understand."
3,"Interesting book in a historical context, children may find it boring","Hans Brinker is an interesting book on many levels. As an adult I enjoyed the historic look at where ""Hollanders"" originated and why some of their traditions are as they are. I also enjoyed the moral aspects of honesty, hard work, integrity and care for family. These are all strong positives for the book.Unfortunately, the plot and story telling left me a bit disappointed. At one point the story shifts dramatically from the Brinker family to an adventure (almost travel narrative with tour guide notes) with other teens who took a skating trip to see other parts of Holland. This just did not fit well together with the main story. The main story is about Hans and his sister Gretel and their parents. The father has had a severe head injury while working on protecting the dikes.I think kids might find the reading tedious and difficult to follow."
3,Hans Brinker,"The beggining and ending of this book were pretty good, probably because they were focus on the Great Race and the Silver Skates. The Middle and most of the book were focused on the history of Holland, which is all good and well if you are a historian. But it was okay."
2,Disappointing,"This ""novel"" is more of a tourist guide (isn't Holland great!) to Holland and its history than a story. I am about half way through (it's been a slog and a struggle). The author introduces Hans Brinker and his sister and their plights at the beginning and I was intriqued. Now I'm slogging away through a bunch of boys running around Holland visiting its museums and talking about its history (like that's what boys generally do). Kind of ridiculous. Hopefully the ""real"" story about the race and the skates that gets you interested in the book in the first place will pick up before the book ends."
2,Oh those riotous Dutch children,"Hans is great, he's a good boy. The Dutch are great, they work with integrity. All is great about the Dutch- but the plot. Those Dutch children are not a riotous bunch. After reading about ice canal for the umpteenth time...I fell asleep.Ice is lovely, but not for 20 pages."
1,Not As Good As Ya May Think,"This story is one of the silliest and most unusual stories I have ever read. While countless other reviewers compare this book to the masterpiece 'Swiss Family Robinson', I think it stinks. It has a silly ice-centric story. Hans Brinker and his pompous little girlfriend are obsessed by the beginning ice skating so much, they are cery hungry for silver ice skates. (at the time of this book's release most skates were made of wood). But this book is horrible. It left a taste reminiscent of Brussels Sprouts in my mouth. Stay away."
2,Fade Away,"If you want to listen to a ""Ten Years After"" bar band playing the hits of the legendary group, the you'll enjoy this CD. It lacks the innovation and originality of the original group. While the guitar player is no slouch, he's no Alivn Lee."
5,Super - one of the best Live albums 2005,"The new T.Y.A. double Live Album is worldclass. Unbelievable Live Power - excellent und perfect.Roadworks includes all the the good T.Y.A. Classics like ""I love to change the world (What a extremly amazing Live Version), Love like a man/I can`t keep from crying, sometimes/Hear me calling and of course - I`m going home!Thats the music of four outstanding musicans (with the fantastic Joe Gooch on the leadguitar), includes also some splendid new material from the ""Now"" studioalbum - ""Roadworks"" is super and for me one of the best Live albums of the year 2005."
3,Not the best not the worst,"I have pretty mixed feelings about this game, which has a pretty much equal pros and cons. The pros are this game rocks for a birthday party or sleepover (you can play all night long), the mini-games are fun, and it is easy to learn. The cons are sometimes the game gets on your nerves, sometimes the computer ""cheats"", and there are better games out there (like Super Smash Bros.) Overall, this game is a good rent, but if you buy it, the one-player mode wears off."
2,Forget this party,"This game is all hype. It is a superb copy of M.P.1 only with less minigames and it seems that the makers forgot the fun parts of M.P.1. All it is is an electronic board game. Don't waste your money on this game! The makers tried to make up for thier boring game with costums for the players and good graphics, and a bunch of hype. Buy a good game with your money!"
5,Another great party,"The game is great. If you liked Mario Party one, this is pretty much the same thing but with new maps/ mini games."
4,Mario Party 2,"This game is a lot of fun. It is kind of like the first Mario Party. So if you liked the first Mario Party you probably would like this on. It has a lot more mini games and they take some out too. They take out some bad games like Bash N' Cash and unfortunatly they took out Cast Aways, which is my favorite game. They added some games like Toad In The Box, Dizzy Dancing, and a lot more. They also added a bank and battle mini games. In the battle mini games if you land on a space with a lightning bolt on it each player pays a certain amount of coins, chosen by the computer and play a mini game and if they come in first or second they get the coins. In my opinion I like Mario Party 2 better than the first Mario Party."
4,Really enjoyable,"We had rented the original Mario party (it didn't really impress us that much) so when it came down to buy one we went with the ""2"" because it stated it had more mini-games. My daughter and I really enjoy playing this game. My whole family will play and have my 3 year old a computer guy. The game does take a long time to play (atleast an hour) but for family game night it is really fun. We can't wait to get Mario Party 3."
4,It was fun,I like this game because it keeps me entertained when I have nothing to do. The reason it got a 4 from me was because when you play you get into it and it bugs you when you can't win that mini game. This happened to my cousin and i. This game will work for you if you don't get to involved.
5,A Big Party,I've played all the Mario Party games but this is the best of them all.It's not the greatest cause like all the Mario Party games it's hard.Hard to become the superstar that is.The minigames are great!They've even kept some old ones like:Hot Jump Rope.The music just rules!After I played it for the time I was humming that music for like 2 weeks!The graphics can be beatin with today's technology but they're still good.I recomend this game for Nintendo fans everywhere.
2,This bo(a)rd game is a rental only,"At first Mario Party 2 seems like one of the best games. Don't get tricked. After a while, Mario Party 2, will be the most boring thing ever. The minigames will get old and it just won't be fun. The multiplayer mode is good for partys but even then will get lame. This is a rental only."
2,2nd parts are not always better,"Is difficult not to think of the first game mostly cause in the second one there is very little or no challenge also the rewards are not as good as in the first game, although there's some new minigames and the chance of training before the real game. in general 1st one was better."
2,"Disappointing. Good, but disappointing.","This game was Disappointing because at the beginning of the game the intro showed ""Mario Land"" and then Wario came and crashed the party. Then they started arguing, and suddenly Bowser took over the land. Then the game said the first to defeat Bowser will have that character's name named after the land. For example, if Luigi won, or something, then the World would be called ""Luigi Land""... or so I thought. I made Yoshi win ALL the worlds, and I also made Yoshi defeat Bowser 6 times in compleatly diffrent areas, yet it was still called ""Mario Land"". Personnaly, I think the game lied becuase the game said who ever beat Bowser would have his or her name in the land. But it all ways has to be for MARIO. No fame for YOSHI. Yoshi beat Bowser, yet he did not get the fame he deserved."
2,No need to attend this party,"I bought this game because of all the hype. Yet,that's all it was. The first game I played was exciting and new. After that it's the same old thing. It is basically an electronic board game with no real excitement. There are four different settings horror, mystery, western and space. You can play 25, 30 or 50 turns. You can also select at any time human or computer players and you have to watch all of their moves. It is repetitive and boring after awhile. I have owned it 2 days and that's enough for me."
4,Great Game,"This is a real great game, although I think Mario party 1 was better than this. The good things about this game is that you can play with up to 4 players and that it is very addictive. The bad things are that it takes a long time to play 1 game and that you cant go to a regular Mini- Game Island. Buy Mario Party 1 before buying the expansion."
3,It was different!,"Mario Party 2 has a few new rules, and different stuff in it. The first one was great, I love it! I thought the new one would have a few new characters, and levels. I was right about there being new levels, but the characters are the same! The graphics haven't changed, but overall, Mario Party 2 was a little bit dissapointing."
4,Another great party!,"Mario Party 2 is even better than the first. Like the first, you pick a character (no new ones...) and move along the boards collecting stars. At the end of each turn, you play a minigame. There are 4 Player Minigames, 2 vs. 2 Minigames, and 1 vs. 3 Minigames. This time, there are no control stick twisting games (thank goodness!). Now you can buy items as you pass by the item shop on the board. There are a bunch of new mini-games, but some old ones. The story is that Mario and his friends are making a theme park, but they are arguing about who to name it after. So Toad suggests to play Mario Party to see who is the Superstar. Overall- a great game. I recommend it!"
5,2 SOCKS OFF!!!,MY KIDS LOVE IT. GREAT TRAVELLING MUSIC. KIDS SING ALONG TO EVERY SONG. ENJOY IT EVERY TIME IT'S PLAYED.
2,Abnormal Child Psycology? Blaa to it...,"This book may contatin alot of useful information. I am a second year student in the Child And Youth Worker program, and it cost me about $140, for about $50 of use... alot of the information in this book was new to me, and I did learn alot, but having said that, the only reason I bought it was because it was mandatory. This book is the most boring piece of crap I have had to read thus far in my program. Facts left and right, but little connection in the actual paragraphs. All connections made are in blurbs about other people's storys. And even those a weak at best. I recomend NOT buying this book. Waste of money and time. If you in college and you need to buy it, show your prof. these two reviews, then refuse to buy it yourself :)"
3,DVD Menu not included,"This DVD does not have a menu. It is very difficult and time consuming to navigate to the exercises on the DVD. While the results may be worth the investment in this DVD, the quality isn't. In this age of high technology I expected a quality DVD in exchange for my money."
3,oh my poor back,"I don't blame the DVD..after 7 back surgeries, I don't expect too muchfrom a DVD, though it did give me some ideas.I do believe it would be well worth the moneyfor somebody starting out with back pain whoDOESN'T want to end up like me !"
1,History,"I wish someone had written similar review on this video before my 40 dollars gone wasted. Despite the customer service department's ignorance claim, the video is seemingly outdated and worth probably 5 to 10 dollars at a garage sale. I don't see why anyone would find this video useful, let alone interesting. Being a Porsche owner myself, I suggest you to get advice from an experienced mechanic when purchasing a 911 with that age. If you are mislead by the title of the video the way I did, you will be equally frustrated as I am now. Besides, why would anyone wastes 40 dollars on a tape that advises you to inspect cars with little value. Unless you are mis-informed of course! How much a 1982 911/930 worth these days? Forget it! 40 dollars can buy many cups of coffee for your friendly mechanic! Don't forget, video is an non-refundable item here, no matter what!"
2,"Looks nice, but...","I got this phone last month. It looks cool, but there are some drawbacks that I wish I had know about earlier. As someone has already mentioned the extended battery is super annoying when you get a call. I feel like an idiot with that thing flapping in my face. Also, if you get a call without the extended battery the phone in your hand gets really hot and of course your hand gets sweaty and the phone keeps sliding down your hand. The antenna is housed at the bottom of the phone so I end up juggling this phone around so my sweaty hands don't enter the antenna zone. I am still trying to figure out the battery and some functions. I haven't figured out how to change the length of time the backlight is on or how to increase the number of rings before it goes to voicemail... Frankly I wish I had a phone that looked a little less cool..."
2,This phone stinks.,"First of all I have had this phone for almost a year.At first I loved this phone,now it's annoying.1.I have to press the reset button 3 to 4 times a week because the phone freezes up.2.The battery life only lasts a half of a day now.3.I can be talking to someone and the phone will hang up on the person.This only started happening recently (No the phone doesnt lose signal)I called Sprint to see if I can get an exchange for this phone.After talking to 8 different people 1 person said I could upgrade.I ordered the upgrade,waited for a week,and no phone.I called back and was told after speaking to 6 more people that I could not get a new phone.That I had to drive to the nearest Sprint store (160 miles away) so they can look at my phone.The day my contract ends is the day I dump Sprint and throw this phone in the trash."
2,Limited features,I asked the saleperson at Radio Shack if the Upstage is compatible with A900 Samsung .So Not I returned the phone
1,Makes me cry,"Honestly when i got this phone (about 10 months ago) it looked great and was pretty ok to use.slowly the battery started to give up...no problem, i have a battery pack (maybe samsung accprected this).then slowly the touchpad started acting weird...it felt like the buttons were raised up and didnt respond properly.now the battery needs recharging after a day (little usage) and the touchpad side is just not usable anymore.When i receive a text message i need to ""flip"" the phone around and then the touchpad gets activated, taking me straight to the music player (which takes long time to load).in short, this is by far the worst piece of equiptment i've ever bought.If you value your money, time and sanity, AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
2,"cool design, good idea, poorly executed","I've had my upstage for almost two years, and i have the case with the spare battery, and I think its a piece of junk, I bought the LG lotus because even with two batteries it doesn't keep a charge. also don't bother buying a blue tooth headset for it because the options for it sucks. Unlike most phones that use blue tooth, this phone doesn't play music through the headset, the only way is to use the long adapter and plug in a headset (convenient?) I dont think so. if you think about buying this, i strongly recommend not. the music is cool, and i like the whole MP3 player idea. but its not enough reason to buy it. after about one year the charger stopped working on it, I had to wiggle it and set it just right to charge it. other then that.....enough said"
4,sweet phone?,"i've had this phone for about maybe 3 months. i like it and all, but the constant flipping, does get annoying. and i'm not clumsy, but it always seams to be slipping out of my hands. It's also bad that the keypad thing on the music side, you barely have to touch it, so it always goes into the internet, when i don't have free internet, and the flip button is easy to press. My aunt got me my phone, and i really do like it. more fun that the razr or however you spell it. It's very fun. and easy to have in your pocket durring school, without it sticking out =]. I do suggest this phone. but in settings, go into sensitivity, and put it on 2 or 3."
1,Out the Window!,"That was the fate of my Samsung Upstage, from a moving vehicle at high speed. Hopefully it was completely destroyed so no one else had the unfortunate experience of operating it.The Upstage is the most frustrating, unreliable and most user unfriendly piece of equipment I've ever owned. Everything about this phone sucks, from the ridiculous ring tones to the tedious flip screen process just to give and recieve text messages. The only real saving grace of this phone is that it's supposed to be an MP3 player, but even the audio quality is poor.If you're a seventeen year old and need to impress your friends then this may be the phone for you. Otherwise, if you're a professional that needs equipment that actually works you'll probably want to pass. The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint."
4,Good Phone,"I have had this phone for about 3 weeks. I switched from my 2 and a half year old Sanyo ghetto phone. At first I was very very annoyed with having to switch back and forth.Pros-Lock switch is hard to find, so keeping it locked when you don't want people to use it is easy-Great camera-Fun to use-Texting is a breeze-Extended battery-Long internal batteryCons-Carrying case is big-The touch pad takes about 2 weeks to get used to-Accidentally gets flipped alotother pros are, that teachers only think it is an mp3 player, texting can be done on both sides, speaker is good quality, flashy, very, very, VERY small, fits in a pocket easily, loud ringerI absolutely love this phone, it is perfect for me."
1,Do Not Buy This Phone!,"This phone sucks!!!It is so annoying to have to flip back and forth for everything! If you are dialing a number and someone else is calling you at the same time you cannot pick up the call you have to ignore the call and then call them back. Plus the internet never works and the reception sucks too, basically it is just like Sprint, a joke!"
5,Sand blaster,My new sandblaster is thus far working well. It was delivered quickly and the price was very reasonable. I was extremely satisfied with both the vendor and the product. I look forward to using it for many years.Dr. John E. Touchton Sr.
4,Foxy Brown-Ill Na Na,"Foxy stormed into the hip-hop world with this 1996 release. And thank God she did. This album gave us a good taste of the REAL Foxy Brown with her very deep vocals here. This album was recorded and released on the bright side of her career. She had Lil' Kim (See ""Ill Na Na"" ...""Waitin for Kim' album to drop...knowin' its hot"") She had Jay-Z (See production and author notes) and she was happy (the whole damn CD...except maybe If I...) SO-Heres the thing. If you are a happy person who is a fan of Lil' Kim and Jay-Z as well-You'll love this. If you want something with more of a bite-Then go for ""Broken Silence"" and watch her use the same flow w. more lyrical content. Overall-A good CD."
1,She ain't Foxy enough for my liking...,"This debut album from Foxy Brown was weak. First of all, she made the HUGE mistake of making a song with Jay-Z...he'll just ruin any cut from the start, no matter how fresh the beat is. Lyrically, Foxy Brown is an airhead and she can't rip anything but her clothes off. I can't stand when people say that she's the best female rapper ever (especially Lil Kim - eek!)...that is a statement which is TOO BOLD to make. None of the tracks on here are any good and the topics of money, sex with numerous men, and jewelry is already played out by No Limit's Master P. Bottom Line: you wanna hear real female rappers, then check out old school tracks from Roxanne Shante, Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte, or Bahamadia and Lauren Hill."
2,foxys debut needs polishing,"for foxys debut she decided to get a bunch of producers and rhymers to do the work for her. her flow never changes and the beats arent even that hot. lyrically she never leaves the topics of sex, jewelry, and money. very disappointing except for the r&b flavor of 'get me home' and the tight beat of 'ill nana'"
1,Wack. Wack. and more Wack.,"Her lyrics are all about money money cars cars and how much she can sex men. She's not keepin it real and is too young to understand what hip hop is about. Another BS cd just to rake in some loot with some ripped off beats, not samples, but complete ripoffs, and wack ass lyrics. Not worth spending your loot to make her rich. PS. Without JayZ, Nas, and Az, Foxxy Brown would be NOTHING right now. Peace"
4,awesome hip hop album,"true this album is full of samples but it's a groovy party album that gets you in the mood and the music on this CD reminds me of my junior high days in 1996/97 when I hear this, it definitely takes you back."
5,Foxy's the best!,"This album is one of my favorite rap albums! I love foxy brown. I first discovered her in the ""touch me tease me"" video by Case. I thought she was so cool! This album is great. But it could've been better if there weren't so many guest rappers. She's an intelligent lady and one hell of a rapper. I like Lil' Kim alot more though. But Foxy's almost just as good too which she proves in this album. I think there could've been a few more songs included on the album. It's too short. Nonetheless, Ill Na Na is a classic! Best songs are ""Get Me Home,"" ""If I Could,"" ""Rock The Bells,"" and ""No One's Gonna"" don't hesitate to get this album if you don't already own it!! she doesn't disappoint!!"
4,Foxy was Foxy!ChinaDoll I liked but not as much.,"To me,Illnana was a female Hiphop classic. On the second album she changed her voice which I feel she should not have done. China Doll was still dope, but Id rather have my old Foxy back. STILL LOVE YOU THOUGH FOX!"
1,Poor Lil' Foxy,"Although Foxy Brown is my second favorite female rapper, I'd have to say that her first CD is the worst I've ever heard out of her, and everyone that I've heard before. Maybe it was because she was a new comer in ""98, but this CD is so bad, it shouldn't even be in the markets today. There's only one song out of 14 that I like called ""IF I"" featuring Jay-Z. So if you have money to spend and go to some kind of music store don't buy this one!!! I'm sorry Foxy, but your other two CD's are great..just not this one!!!"
3,i like foxy brown but not this cd,usually i like foxy brown's music but im i am not sure that i like this cd with the samples that i have just heard and the things i have heard other places i think that with her talent she could do much better.
1,painful read,"I had such high hopes for this book but I found it a complete waste of time and frustrating. I did find the writing clever, and laughed out loud at places, but for the most part it was a rambling mess. I felt like the writer dropped acid, locked himself in a room for a month and just let his imagination go wild. This is not a compliment.This is one of the few books where I truly felt like I wanted my money back and an apology from the author and to have one week of my reading life back. I usually pass books forward but this one is being put right in the trash."
3,funny but too out there,"venture into the worl of nick twisp as he takes us through his world of mansturbation, intelligence, lies, and teens troubles. at times unbelieveable but its fiction. very smart for his age i couldnt understand some of his vocabulary. should a 13 year old know so much? crude at times but still manageable enough to not put it down. fast read. youll enjoy it"
2,Just Disappointing,"I tried to like this book. I really did. It begins strong, diving right into irreverence and humor and welcoming you right in. Unfortunately, it doesn't go anywhere from there. The plot winds and sputters and wanders in increasingly unbelievable and ridiculous (not to mention unentertaining) directions which left me wondering, ""why am I still reading this?"" Its ""candid"" frankness about sexuality is fine in the beginning but quicky dissolves into little more than repetitive frat-boy erection humor. I'd definitly pass on this one."
5,Real teenager 90's,I enjoyed it. Told from perspective of 14 year old boy--real feelings (good and bad). Funniest book I've ever read.
5,I wish I coul live a little,"I enjoyed this book (both times) for the pure joy of its entertaining absurdity. Something about it was undeniably fresh, and though it does need rampant forward propulsion to suspend disbelief- that is also its value. Thank goodness it didn't take itself so seriously as to try and be realistic. I actually found Nick very sympathetic, and so in touch with the aspiration and fears of that age that I gawked when I found out the authors age. I definitely recommend the sequel. Though it might not have the same bite as the first book- it does bring it all to a satisfying conclusion: something I missed with the first book."
5,Stellar book by a stellar author!,"Youth in Revolt was an eye-opening, page-turning, hilarious, and raunchy look at the psychological angst of a 14 yr. old boy (the protagonist and narrator Nick Twisp). Just like Catcher in the Rye's crude, in-your-face narrator, C.D. Payne's portrayl of sexually-deprived (and curious) Nick is awesome. I gave an oral book report about this novel and my entire class was enraptured. Read it and BELIEVE ME, you will be hooked to Nick, Sheeni, and those rabid dogs. Long live the Revolt, and ROCK ON MR. PAYNE!"
5,THANK GOD FOR RANGEING HORMONES,"Your a cold heartless person if you don't think this is one of the funniest books ever written. Shenni is a Vixen, Nick is a Genius, and I getto play Paul in the movie. You might like the Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys by Chris Furham"
2,Meh,"Was I the only person who didn't find this book even remotely funny? I may have chuckled a few times at the begining, but after 10 pages nothing else was funny.And the characters and situations are so unrealistic. Nick falls for some extremely unlikeable girl, sheeni. She's annoying and pretentious, and showed no redeemable traits. Neither did Nick. None of the characters had any depth! It seems all the relationships in the book were based on lust and ""blind love"". Nothing special about this book at all. Especially becuase i didn't ""laugh out loud"" even once."
2,"Two stars, only because I finished it","I love ""coming of age"" stories and I'm very quick to laugh, so I was very excited to begin reading this book. But after the first 50 pages, I found it becoming increasingly stupid, farcical, and not particularly funny. While it had its moments, it was only barely good enough to keep reading. So I kept on, hoping it would get better. But it never did. It actually got worse.I also found the dialog preposterous. Even though these are supposed to be very gifted and bright kids, the dialog just didn't ring true. And have you EVER, EVER heard a teenage boy refer to his girlfriend as ""darling""? Maybe they do in prep schools, but not in any school I've ever attended.If you like your humor clever or witty (or even crass), stop here. This book is not for you. If you enjoy slapstick comedy, bedroom farces, manic and overblown plots of scheming and deception, and think boys in drag are hilarious, perhaps you'll enjoy it. My advice? Don't waste your time on this one."
5,"Funny, funny, funny.","This is by far the funniest book I've ever read. 6 months in the life of a 14 year old kid who goes through some of the same things a lot of people his age, but he just takes it a little further than the typical teen. Throughout the short 500 pages of the book, Nick has not only the local police department out for him, but the FBI is looking for him as well. He destroys an entire block of buildings in Oakland. He makes the world think his friend has committed suicide. These are only very few of the ways Nick has managed to make the people around him angry. The book only gets funnier as you read."
5,Fully Fleshed Characters Bring Joy to This Work,"It is rare in modern literature to find an author that takes the time to fully flesh out characters to the point of mercileeness. In ""Youth in Revolt,"" C.D. Payne makes it his mission to create complete and whole characters in every turn of his book, and he succeeds. Whether it's the rebellious older sister with good intentions buried under past mistakes, the good natured boyfriend of the mother whose masculine hands hide a sensitive nature, or the overweight closeted gay boy from next door, Payne takes great pains to flesh out his characters and make them believeable."
5,funnnnnnny,Book is super hilarious.really enjoyed reading it and I don't usually love reading but I could not stop until I finished it.
5,A wonderful cult book!,"This is a wonderful book. If you have seen the movie I suggest going with the second book first so that you can continue the story (unless you just want to start at the beginning). Either way the wit and humor of these books are particularly satisfying. I haven't read a more funny and witty book in my life. Reminiscent of old middle school pranks on steroids, this series is the best thing to happen to pop literature in a long time."
4,Recommended reading if you ever seek to understand the mind of a 14-year-old boy,"This book is a hilariously honest presentation of how a modern 14-year-old boy (maybe teen, but not quite a man yet) sees the world. Some of the details easily date the material back to the early 90's, but that only added to the nostalgia for me. Nick Twisp, the story's protagonist, is a nihilist-in-the-making. With the right mix of constant embarrassment and the unraveling of his home life, Nick starts down a destructive path that most of us would only halfway fantasize about.The pacing is quick, and the dialogue is spot-on given Nick's desire to sound more elitist and brainy than his age. I recommend this book if you ever seek to understand the mind of a 14-year-old boy minus the larger-than-life destructive tendencies."
4,Dark- yet Hillarious,"Tired of how bad your life seems? Pick up Youth in Revolt. Your life will seem like a day in the park. Payne paints a dark, twisted picture of Nick, but it is absolutely hillarious. You will laugh out loud for hours. I couldn't put it down."
5,A wild coming-of-age story that should not be missed!,"This is certainly the most entertaining book that I have ever read. I cannot urge you enough to read it. I came upon it in the bookstore several years ago and have been trying to find an equally appealing book ever since. After completing the book in three days, I passed it on to friend after friend until nearly everyone that I knew had read it. Our opinions are in synergy and we steadfastly reccomend this book to all."
5,Twisp's Titillating Twists and Turns,A brilliant black comedy centered around precocious teens... captures adolescent angst with hilarious commentary on society in general. Flawless.
2,Youth in Revolt: Audio Book 1,"I love the series Youth in Revolt. It made me very exciting seeing it in audioform because now I can listen to it while at work and while my eyes are too tired or whatever. I normally have no issue with audiobooks.But there's something wonky going on with the reader's voice....it's just my opinion, but I really don't like Paul Michael Garcia's voice. He does pretty good with other characters, but the voice he uses for Nick really sucks. Also, I found a few word errors, the very first one I found was while Nick was changing in My Green Haven to go to the last dinner with Sheeni- the word Payne uses is ""Transient"" but Garcia uses ""Transparent"" I don't know if that bothers anyone else...I still listen to it, because its YIR. I don't bitch about it, but I just really don't like it."
5,To be invincible again...,I could not put this book down! I loved it! I lent it to all of my friends and they couldn't put it down either - I was lucky to get it back! C.D. Payne - please give us more!
5,My favorite book so far,"I was lucky enough to have this book in my posession while I was going through the chicken pox. A friend of mine from work passed it on to me and I have since passed it on to another friend. The week I read it during my Chicken Pox was a week of pure laughs and loads of questions, like how in the, what in the??? This book is one of my favorites of all time and I would highly reccomend it to ANYONE."
3,"Funny, but it gets old...","This book was a little ridiculous. Personally, I hated Nick Twisp by the middle of the book. And all the ""darlings"" and the completely un-teen-like dialogue just got on my nerves after a while. Plus its so saturated with double-entendres that it makes all the characters seem dense.Every other page Nick is masturbating or making some reference to his ""T.E."" It was funny at first but then it wasn't."
4,"Interesting, very interesting","Well, I'd just like to say, the first few pages will really piss you off. I mean, there's no way a 14 year old could write like that. But after you read it for a while, you'll be hooked to it. I mean, at times I was staying up to 2-3 in the morning just reading it. For some reason, although i couldnt tell why, I just had to know what happened next. So besides that tiny complaint about the language, the only other thing i found wrong with the book is it's totaly unbelievable. I mean some of these events are so unlikely that its almost funny. The book itself is alos pretty funny, but i found taht wasn't its strong point. Also, there is LOTS of sex related activities in the book. For some thats a good thing, but its bad for others. So all in all, It wastruly a very good book to read. It just made you want to keep reading and reading. So if you want an entertaining book, then definately get this book. It's strange, but very good"
5,A Great Read,"To read Youth in Revolt is to travel back in time to when you were fourteen years old. Filled with creative insight and satirical irony in the spirit of The Catcher in the Rye, I laughed out loud the whole way through. Follow Nick Twisp in his quest to rise above public education, handle his manic parents, and lose his virginity. He is the classic youth who is too smart for his own good, and must overcome obstacles at every moment in order to be with his ""One and Only Love"", Sheeni. He undergoes the tradition change from innocence into knowledge, but does so in such an original and hilarious way that you will not be able to put the book down until you finish the last page. A great read."
5,Hilarious,This is the funniest book I have ever read. Every time I go to the bookstore I check under Payne to see if this guy has written something else.
5,Youth in Revolt IS THE BEST,I enjoyed this book a lot. It's a good book fro the price too. It's like Three books for the price of ONE
1,Really bad.,"This book is really bad. It's impossible to care about the pretentious characters, and horrific child abuse and rape are played for laughs. Which I guess would be worse if I cared about the characters. There is no one to like in this book. I bought it for my teenage son based on the great reviews, but picked it up to read when he expressed no interest in it. Now I'm glad he didn't read it."
5,Youth In Revolt ROCKED,This book was great it starts out quite slow but once the book gets going it's a real page turner at 500 pages its a good book to pick up and read every now and then because you won't really lose the pace of the story. Nick is a brilliant character and the people surrounding him in the story are priceless I would reconment this to everyone.
5,The funniest book ever written--no contest!!,"I've read a fair number of books, many of them funny, but Youth in Revolt is, without a doubt, the funniest book I have ever read. I am not a 14-year-old boy. I am a 31-year-old woman, and I can't say enough about C.D. Payne and his comic masterpiece! This is a book that I will re-read once a year or so for the rest of my life. You must trust me--buy this book now and read it as soon as you receive it. You may want to refrain from reading it in public places (learn from my mistakes--I embarrassed myself more than once, laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face). Give this book to friends as a gift; they will love you forever. I could go on and on, but I can't here. Just trust me and buy it. Say hi to Nick and Carlotta for me. Enjoy!"
2,Redundant and tedious at nearly 500(!) pages,"This book is like the Jerry Springer show--it's kind of funny at first while also being a little sad (never has an author so thoroughly but inaccurately conveyed a lower middle class, ""white trash"" existence. yeah, I know it's parody, but stil...) and the joke gets old really quickly. As a 250 page book, I'd give it 4 stars. As it stands now at nearly 500 pages, it's way below average."
2,im a my scene fan but.................,"my friend got this toy and i really wanted to see it and play with it. when i went to her house i saw the doll and...ew. it was the worst looking doll i have ever scene. it had really messy hair and the makeup was ugly and the clothes were just ugly. the only thing really i like about this doll is the chair, the fake magazines and the fact that she is a my scene. i got intrested in bratz and they are way better. stick with a doll youll enjoy!!!!"
1,My Scene sucks,"I read a review that said that if there was no Barbie, there wouldn't be a Bratz. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? Bratz didn't copy off that ugly, skinny doll. The Bratz are way better than Barbie (also more realistic). And My Scene is just another crappy re make of Barbie (like Flavas, Wee 3 Friends, ect) This doll is soooooo ugly. My Scene are ugly. And face it - My Scene are WAY more innapropriate than Bratz will EVA be. Bratz are sooooooooo much better than these dopey ugly dolls and everyone who thinks my scene dolls are better are just incredibly jelous of Bratz or they can't live with the truth....or they can't HAVE a Bratz doll because they're so expensive..."
2,ok so your right!!!!!! so what,"i used to love the my scene but since the new lines came out i started hating em'. their cloths suck and the things they come with like makeup chairs brushes popcorn ect. are useless. i agree with every one! bratz are the best. they have salons and swimming pools but my scenes dont. and especially chelsea she is so ugly!! and to the mom with the 13 year old daughter, dont you think that she wants to look like the bratz and DRESS like em' too. just saying you should let your daughter enjoy bratz too. hope i helped you not to waste your money on these new lines like hollywood line and maiami line. they suck. get bartz i know i am"
1,Shut the F*CK UP.,"YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT US......BRATZ ARE BETTER, YOU KNOW IT! LIVE WITH IT, MY SCENE FREAKS!BECAUSE BRATZ ARE ARE ARE THE BEST!!!!! AND MY SCENE SUCKS SH*T."
2,A PIECE OF CRAP!,MY SCENE LOVERS NEED TO STOP HATING ON BRATZ.THESE DOLLS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF CHEAP PIECES OF CRAP!THEIR HEADS POP OFF AND THEY COPPIED OFF BRATZ!!
5,Shut up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It`s Sara siblini again.I love my scene+Flavas,and my scene are beautiful.They are not ugly or lame!Just shut up!!!!!!!These bad reviews can let other children how loves my scene,hates my scene after a while.UNDERSTAND?????????????????????????STUPID GIRL AND STUPID GIRLS,I WILL NEVER WANT TO SEE BAD REVIEWS ABOUT THE MY SCENE DOLLS AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IF SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO BEAT MY REVIEW,I DON`T CARE AT ALL.I AM 12 YEARS OLD AND I LOVE MY SCENE,AND I AM COLLECTING ALL KIND OF BARBIES OR MY SCENE EXCEPT BRATZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MY SCENE DOLLS ARE NOT UGLY.THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!!!SARA SIBLINI!!!!!!!!!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!!!!!!!BRATZ HATER!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S.THE MOST REVIEWER I LIKE HERE IS ""CHELSEA CHURRO"",BECAUSE SHE NEVER WRITES BAD REVIEWS ABOUT MY SCENE,AND I AGREE WITH HER!!!!!!!"
5,Stop the war,I love both dolls bratz and my scene but im sick with these childish reviews bratz rule my scene sucks im mean please people get a life and for thoes who have the same feeling like me your a better thinker
5,THE BEST !!!,"I am a teenage girl and i brought this Chelsea doll for my 9 year old sister she is soooo into Myscene even i used to be when i was little, it is so fantastic!!.It is amazing how she sits down quietly and plays with it instead of nagging ME to play with her, i just think Myscene toys are EXCELLENT!!!!."
5,"Lisa,*****MY SCENE QUEEN,Seriously!","Okay,great doll.But it`s becoming a 3-some with Chelsea Churro,Me(LGP3LNC)and Sara.I want itto be a 5-some again!I was`nt that close,but I was gonna ask you guys if you wanted to be my friends too!It seems like you have dissapeared off the face of the earth.E-mail us PLEEEEEAAAASSSSSE!We miss you SO MUCH!(Sad,the 3 some with only 3/5 of the circle of friends)Chelsea Churro,LGP3LNC,Sara Siblini And I wish Lisa and ******MY SCENE QUEEN******.My scene queen was on here last November 1st.LGP3LNCEverything luverforeverin all eternityrock squared"
1,MY SCENE SUCK,"Like it or not, Bratz dolls are rock starz. What are you jealous that the My Scene dolls only get the crappy stuff. They are gay retarded slutty ugly dolls. Bratz dolls are the best. And they always will be. Being an extra in a movie is dumb. Being real live rock starz is awsome. Whether you like it or not, the Bratz dolls are rock starz. And My Scene being in a movie, AS IF. The only time the My Scene could be in a movie is if they were pretty and if Bratz dolls were ugly. Well, that won't happen in a gazillion years. Bratz dolls are better. Deal with it you whiny My Scene losers. Bratz won and My Scene lost."
3,hollywood chelsea,4-i don't like her outfit2-in the movie the girls lie and say there extreas4-dosen't fall apart alot3-you do the maththis doll is okher outfit is ugly.chelsea is good looking in themovie but this doll is almost unatractive.when i say this at target it came with alotof accsories. so don't get this for someone 3 or under.here how i rate5 star= A4 star= B3 star= C2 star= D1 star= F(...)p.ss STOP THE WAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Oh my gosh!!! i think i'll barf!!!!!,"first of all, this hunk-0-junk is the biggest waste of anyones time. especially if you play with your doll while watching the dumbest movie called lifesize!!!bleach!!!the whole friggin concept of my scene dolls just makes me barf!!!!just the fact that these people are part of some some stupid ditz whose living is to smile for a fake camera, is just friggin mind boggling in a horrendifying way. what would drive some psycho to buy this product you ask??? well guess what. i have your answer. it is because the media has affected EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE UNITED STATES, leaving the impression that dolls are the way to survival."
1,EWWWWWWWWWWWW,"I think that My Scene sooooooooooooooo copied off of Bratz. Bratz are much cooler. Besides, My scene dolls have REALLY long necks and otherwise look A LOT like Bratz. (Only much more uglier.) I belive that Bratz fans can win this war! Go Bratz!Peace, (At least until My Scene fans call a truce)Martial Arts GalMay Bratz stay and My Scene PAY"
4,so you think my scene copied bratz????????,your right my scene did copy bratz. but bratz coied barbie. duhhhhhh without barbie there will be no bratz or my scene. just saying bye
5,UM!!!!!HELLO!!!!????,"Can you shut up!!!!My scene and Bratz are nice toys.So dont come in here and write a stupid review about my scene,and say Bratz are better.They both are great."
5,Beautiful doll,"I got this doll for my niece at Target when I let her pick out anything in the store. If I remember correctly it was $15.99. She loves My Scene.com and she just really loves Chelsea. This was her 3rd Chelsea doll and she was really excited that it came with so many accessories and really pretty clothes. The doll itself is nothing short of stunning, she has beautiful sweet eyes, soft and silky lovely hair, and just her face is so beautiful. It comes with ALOT of accessories and provides my niece with houres of fun. She has no one to play barbie with so she's constantly bugging me to play with her. She always has Magical mermaid, Yasmin, one of her 10 Ariel dolls, and a Chelsea in her hands. This is a beautiful My Scene barbie doll and at a CHEAP price here on Amazon! A perfect gift that provides hours of fun!"
5,Awsome!!!Pretty!!!Beautiful!!!Amazing!!!,"This doll is great.Her hair is gorgoeus,her 2nd outfits are beautiful,and everything else with her.Chelsea is the best one in the Hollywood collection.I would like to say that:The my scene goes Hollywood collection is the best colllection in all the my scene dolls collections.Their clothes are awsome,their shoes are pretty,Their earrings and necklesses are amazing,And I hope the movie rox,because I havent seen it.Lidnsay Lohan is beautiful.I don`t have her.Her real look is better than the doll.This Chelsea is the best Chelsea doll ever made.Lets talk about the accissories:She have many things.She have perfium,and many more make-up accissories.She have extra clothes.They are pink and lovley.Now about the doll:Her clothes are great.The shoes are adurable,her coat has cute colors.Her earrings and neckless are fabulous and gold.The my scene dolls rock.Collect them all.And the best thing in the collection is the party limo.Thanks!!!"
5,I WILL TELL MY AGE!,"OKAY, I'M MAKING MY BIG CONFESSION ON MY AMAZON PAGE. THIS DOLL IS BEAUTIFUL, AND EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS FALSE, I HAVE HER AND HER HAIR NEVER FRIZZES UNLESS YOU SHAKE HER TO DEATH"
1,Rock Angelz are better,"This Holleywood collection is the main collection and this is what the movie is about, right? Well, the Bratz Rock Angelz are the main and they are better. For one thing. The My Scene girls are going to be extra's in a movie except for Madison, but they aren't all the stars. Not like the Bratz for their Rock Angelz collection. They all get to become famous rock starz. And if I had to chose between being a rock star or being in a Linsey Lohan movie, duh, rock star is better then being an extra in a stupid Linsey Lohan movie. Bratz dolls are better anyway. And they always will be. Bratz rule My Scene drool, Bratz won My Scene lost, Bratz are pretty, My Scene are ugly. Cased close, Bratz won and My Scene lost."
2,So-so Film,"No offense to Adrian, I love his acting, but his director debut of this documentary was poor and so I would not recommend this film. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and the storyline about him seeking to find and get to know his biological father, who turned out to be wonderful. It was his mother that was the cause of keeping his father away all those years - an interesting twist. I liked Adrian's honesty throughout the film however in a few parts his directorship lacked integrity. The film pulled the viewers leg with a fake scene as a joke at a critical part in the film. It was totally inappropriate and in really poor taste. Those types of ""joke"" scenes have no place in the actual film but rather in the bleepers or outtakes section of the DVD. I like Adrian and I hope his films are refined in the future for mass success."
4,A TEN STAR WONDER!!!,"The most exquisitely rapturous of all the cds in my collection. It will bring you to your knees in devotion and longing. A true work of love and repentance, mystery and majesty, the human heart in the embrace of the loving, suffering Savior. Ahhhh so tender, it must be heard...there aren't words to quite explain this experience. Voices from heaven! This remains a tender and generous work of devotion. As far as I'm concerned, this is my choir of choice in this category... balanced, moving, passionate and gifted with a talent that most surely is ""divine""!"
1,Entertaining but NOT SAFE,"My two year old has been in love with this toy since day one (it's now 4 months later). However, she was holding it today when HER HAIR GOT CAUGHT IN THE GEAR ON HIS FOOT. To my surprise, the toy didn't even shut off as her hair was being wound around the wheels! The toy also wound around a friend's Halloween costume as she was holding it back in October. I thought (foolishly) that I would give it another chance since the costume was organza. Pablo's now in the garbage and my daughter lost about three inches of hair in one spot. VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!"
3,No remote- picture is misleading,"Just a quick fyi, the picture above shows Pablo with a remote control. He does NOT have a remote. He has a series of spins and reverse spins that he randomly executes but you cannot control his moves, I wish you could! My one year old loves him as long as he isn't moving! LOL"
2,Very Disappointing,"My one year old son loves the Backyardigans and we were excited to get this doll for him. I didn't realize when we bought it, but Pablo only sings/plays the main theme song from the Backyardigans, nothing else, which gets old very fast. With all the music in the shows, they could have added at least one other song.Also, Pablo cannot spin/roll on carpeting, and he requires a large-ish area to do his whole dance. The only rooms we have bare floors in are our kitchen and bathroom, and Pablo constantly bumped into things and stopped.We returned this Pablo and got the one with a firefly where he sings a lullaby, and my son loves that one."
1,This toy breaks easily,"This is the second time I tried to post a review. Don't know if amazon is censoring reviews.Bought this toy through wizard. Got it on time. When I opened the box and tested the toy it worked great. But when I brought it home that night to show to my daughter (she's 8 months), the toy would spin and walk. It would sing fine, but when Pablo tried to move, his gears would make this grinding noise. I couldn't believe it! Other users have pointed out that cheap glue was used in the manufacturing. When that glue ran out, it wouldn't allow the gears to spin. I should've gotten an RMA, but we still like the songs.Don't buy this cheap product. Stay away!"
2,not very durable,"My grandson received this toy for his first birthday. It worked fine for about an hour. It still sings and spins but makes an obnoxious gringding sound. There's no way to get to the inner workings to see if it's a gear that can be fixed. We will replace it because he adores Pablo but I'm guessing the replacement will have the same problem.Other than the horrible grinding sound the toy is quite appealing. My grandson carries it around with him all the time, he wants to sleep with it, and gives it lots of hugs and kisses. Too bad the mechanical engineering wasn't up to par on this toy. Also, as others have mentioned-it is not a soft toy. It is made of hard plastic with plush fabric over it sans padding. We'll look for a soft plush Pablo for sleeping with."
4,cute,My granddaughter loves this toy but after a few months the toy doesn't walk without making a stripping sound. He still sings and moves and my 1 year old granddaughter has been able to push his hand to make him sing since she was 8 months old. This toy is safe for babies but not as durable as it should be.
4,Spin Pablo Spin,I purchasd this for my 2 year old son's birthday and he loved it. After watching him 2x he began to spin and hold his hands out and it was hilarious. The song does get old after a while especially since my 3 year old daughter loves it and continually presses the flipper and my son just spins and sings
3,Cute toy but gets boring fast,"My [...] son is a huge Backyardigans fan, he loves the commercial for this toy so I decided to get him one for Christmas. He played with it for about 30 minutes and hasn't picked it up since. He prefers his beanie Pablo to this spinning noise maker, lol."
2,sucks,"It came damaged with the clutch cover broken and the spark plug broken in half. I fixed it as best I could but the real problem is the engine. It has no power and it stalls out over and over. I have the proer plug in, the right choke settings etc. It run rough and stalls out. I guess the platform is good for a new engine and clutch but I hate to invest the money in it. I guess there is a reason Yamaha, honda, etc. are still in business even though their motorcycles cost thousands of dollars. I do like the riding position, the brake, etc. But the thing won't run."
4,Helps you get out of a rut,I found this book to be great for when you have designer's block. This book is filled to the rim with illustrated examples and makes a great quick reference. The best thing about it is it doesn't cost an arm and a leg like most design books.
1,Very Disappointing,"This book is going back a lot faster than it got here! Deals almost exclusively with very modern landscapes that you would see in the southern part of the country. The designs tended to be very geometric, rigid and unnatural. If you prefer a more classic, free flowing landscape design, then this book is not for you."
3,meh,It was what I expected. Came on time and in the condition descried. I needed this for school . It was kind of pointless to me though.
1,Not much in terms of inspiration or practical guidance,I purchased this book to consider options and look for inspiration and practical guidance for my 5 acre property in Australia. I found the book heavy on the philosophical aspects of design and more bent towards urban design. Not my cup of tea I'm afraid.
1,Should have read the reviews,The cover is very misleading. It is being returned within 20 minutes of opening the package.
1,A version for British readers,"This is not the NRSV that US readers expect -- it is a new version, ""Anglicized,"" with British grammar, punctuation, and numbers. This new version is not indicated on the web page or on the box, but the title page notes the version and pp xix-xx of the preface explains. Most US readers would not prefer this version if they are looking for the usual ""NRSV."""
3,Quick primer of what to expect,"While not in depth, it gives a nice simple to understand overview of what to expect. I gave it as a gift to my sister who is starting a house building project who doesn't have much time to read."
2,Poor defense of thesis,"This book's thesis, that the Texas annexation controversy was a key element that brought the Civil War, is not defended well by the author. Mr. Silbey is highly respected, but this book was a rush job. There are several editorial mistakes that also make the book annoying. I expected a detailed discussion about the annexation debate. Instead, the book focuses on such things as the growing schism in the Democratic Party in the 1840s. A poor effort by a good writer and researcher. There are much better books on antebellum disputes in general and Texas in particular. Skip this one."
3,Problems with the Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition has many flaws -- there are quotation marks and note markers (those superscripted numbers in the text) in the wrong place on many pages. Worse, you cannot navigate the cursor to 'float' over some of the note markers, so you cannot easily access those notes.As for the content of the book, it's a good overview of the Texas controversy and makes a good case for Texas as a turning point in the sectional crisis. I think it might work well for an undergraduate class as it is peppy and brief."
4,Top lip needs to be larger,"I used these ramps to change my car's oil. They were very, very stable and did exactly what was described. However, I HIGHLY recommend that a second person be watching your car as you (the driver) drive the car onto the ramp. The little lip on the edge of the ramps can easily be overcome by the several hundred horsepower of your car, causing really awkward stares from neighbors if you end up running right over the ramps."
4,Great build quality but still too tall for lowered vehicle(s),"I purchased these ramps after reading a number of positive reviews online. Unlike some of the cheap looking variants sitting on the shelves at the local express auto store, these Rhino Ramps are of exceptional quality. Users will notice that each ramp feels very solid / stable with rubber stops on the underside (to help reduce the likelihood of each slipping).I read some reviews stating that these ramps worked well for [even] lowered vehicles. Those claims are true depending on how far out your front bumper is from the front wheels. My vehicle (VW R32) has a little over 5"" of clearance [from ground to front lip]. These Rhino Ramp 8000's are still too tall to allow my vehicle from rolling up without the use of additional extensions.-1 stars for being somewhat inconvenient in that the two ramps can not be stacked or stored with a minimal footprint."
2,Cheap plastic,"A top corner broke off of one of these ramps, rendering it dangerous. This happened because the ramp slipped and my car's tire landed on the corner. These ramps slip easily, as other users have mentioned. They need to be redesigned with a stronger material and with something on the bottom to make them cling to the ground."
4,"good, but overpriced",These ramps get the job done and are quite durable. They worked well with my Toyota Camry and didn't scrape the fender area. I gave them 4 stars because Amazon is charging too much for them. Check your local Advance Auto Parts store or their website because they have them for only $39.99
5,Great product,"I have had 2 different auto ramp systems prior to the rhino ramp 8000. I had the same problem with both, sliding as I was trying to drive up on them with my car or truck or riding lawnmower. This does not happen with the rhino ramp. It stays in place and does not scoot any. I recommend this ramp system!"
5,Awesome,"I use them whenever I don't feel like putting my car on jack stands. The rubber feet fell off quickly, but they didn't make much of an improvement on traction anyway, so no real problem. Very durable. I'm pleased."
1,DO NOT BUY- You have been warned.,"Total waste of money. Just slides as you try to go up on it. May as some here say work ok with light cars with skinny tires. I dont know. But, I do know if you have wide tires and a heavy car forget it."
3,"They're OK, but could have more lift","These things only lift a total of 6 inches, so if your car has a lot of clearance under it, then they'll probably be perfect. If clearance is tight, then I would look elsewhere for a set of higher lifting ramps. I'll keep these and use them to lift my truck, but I had to buy a different set of low-entry-angle ramps (with a 10 inch lift) to work under my cars (2004 Taurus and 2008 Taurus)."
3,Good for heavier vehicles,"Works great for my Tundra, but my wife's Honda Civic doesn't have enough weight to hold the ramps down and prevent them from sliding around while trying to get on them. Quality is good, but without the weight and decent gripping feet they become a challenge for some vehicles."
3,Poor Rubber feet,I have a 07 Mustang GT and when I try to drive up the ramp all it does is push them after I get about half way up. the rubber feet are useless they don't do anything but get torn off. The only way I can get up these things are if someone holds them from sliding or I but them up against something. Then getting off them is equally a challenge as once again they get dragged around instead of staying still. They do however work great for my 93 Eclipse which is front wheel drive. No problems getting up on them or off them so they are not totally useless.
1,Not for Concrete,"These things are not at all safe. They may work out on dirt, but if you try to use them on a concrete floor, raising the front of a rear wheel drive vehicle (or the rear of a front drive), they shoot out from under the wheels and become lethal projectiles. One of them actually put a huge dent in the front of my Snap-On roll around and it would have surely shattered the ankle of anyone it had hit. I have a set of these plastic POS's and won't even give them away for fear of them injuring someone. Go for a good set of welded angle iron ramps and stay FAR, FAR away from these killers."
1,Do not buy - cheap plastic - broke 1st use Toyota Scion Xa,On the first use one of the ramps slid and broke. It was a small car and these things are suppose to be good for 8000 lbs? Toyota Scion Xa 2005. The problem with these is they are plastic and light weight. I followed the directions exactly. You would be much better off with metal steel ramps that have some weight to them at any price. These might work in level hard packed gravel... but on a smooth level dry clean garage floor they slide too easy and are not safe.
2,Ramps Slide Around and Buckle Under Pressure,"I own a Ford Crown Victoria, which is RWD. When I first tried to drive up these ramps, they slid (BTW, I did not ride the brakes during this attempt). To keep them from sliding, I placed them against the curb. The second time I drove up the ramps, the plastic started to buckle. At the point where the ramps met the curb, the plastic bowed outwards. These ramps may have temporarily held the weight of my car, but I don't believe they would last for long. When they finally fail under pressure, someone is going to get seriously hurt. From now on, I will only use steel vehicle ramps. Plastic is not a very good load-bearing material."
4,They worked well...sort of.,I purchased these as they were supposed to work well with a low profile car. I own a 2004 Mazda3 and the front bumper still scraped the top of these ramps when I was trying to go up them.These also will slide on a smooth concrete surface like a garage floor. Otherwise they work well and are of good quality.
4,Good Ramps,"These are very nice. Made well and work well. Used on my driveway, I've had no slippage. They feel secure when driving up on them, and secure when the car is in place. I couldn't be happier."
4,Lifting an ATV,"I purchased these ramps to raise my ATV to make it easier to change engine oil. Since I am using an automobile specific product for another purpose, it isn't perfect for my needs. Access under the ATV would be better if the ramps were steeper and shorter in length. However, this is not really a fault of the product but because I am adapting it to another purpose. The ramps are very sturdy, raise the ATV to a good working height, and hold it stable. These ramps come in a very big box but were shipped free with Amazon's super saver free shipping. I was able to get better ramps and a lower cost at Amazon than I could purchase locally."
3,Slides unless you block it in place,"Like other people have commented, I found that the ramps slide backwards when you try to drive up them. Especially on wet pavement.I blocked mine with a couple bags of gravel that I happened to have laying around, which solved the problem and I was able to drive up the ramps without further issue.It was faster, even when I had to block them with the gravel, than when I used a floor jack to lift the car, place a jackstand, then go around to the other side and jack that side up and place a jackstand.So overall, these ramps saved me a little time, but they're not perfect."
4,Work well... but overpriced at Amazon,"These ramps work well enough and are light to move around. I picked these up at my local Advance Auto for $30, so it pays to shop around before purchasing here."
5,great price and gets the job done,"We needed some ramps to make it easier to change the oil on our car, and this definitely fits the bill. These are fairly lightweight, but also extremely durable, and they get the job done."
4,Very Good,Very good product. We use this on our chicken's back where she has a featherless spot. It helps prevent pecking from other chickens and is allowing the feathers to grow back more easily. The pump spray bottle is easy to use and easy to direct the spray- I've heard the aerosol can be very messy and has a lot of over-spray.
2,Definitely not worth $80.,"Too easy to build. Does not expand to a standing position, though the instructions do not claim it does."
5,They're All There,David Houston had 24 Top Ten hits on the country charts. Having them all on this CD is outstanding. I've seen too many greatest hits collections go either too far or not far enough. This is a wonderful collection. I highly recommend it.
5,Just Bought a Second Jacket,I bought one of these jackets and two pairs of matching pants a couple of years ago. They make an excellent jogging suit combination. I found the jacket to be very comfortable and convenient for wearing around the house in cooler weather and it's easy to slip another jacket over it if you need something warmer or more water proof. Since I wear the jacket so frequently I decided to order another one just now.
3,Waaaaay short,"I'm 6' tall, and the XXXL jacket doesn't quite make it to my waist, and I'm pretty long of leg. The sleeves are just barely long enough as well...when I stetch out the arms are stretched pretty tight. This would be a pretty good fit for a guy in the 5' 6"" range, or even shorter.When I called the manufacturer's information line prior to ordering, I asked what height the jackets are tailored for. The poor girl on the other end had absolutely no idea what I was talking about, simply kept repeating ""The sizes are for chest size...""All in all, I purchased this jacket to take to Disney World for evenings and the occasional rain shower, and it's fine for that purpose. For daily wear, no way."
3,Agree on aerator problem,"It's beautiful and installation was a breeze, but I also have a problem with the spray being too strong. Mine doesn't seem quite as bad as the previous reviewer's, but I do have to be careful not to turn it on so much that water sprays everywhere.Also, you can buy this faucet cheaper at Lowe's."
3,Not a quality like it's big brother - the kitchen faucet,Cheap metals bend with any pressure and the faucet is not a clean 1 piece design. The side shows an ugly seam unlike it's big brother model made for the kitchen.
2,Sent it right back,"What isn't completely obvious from the picture unless you look closely is that the outer surface of the spout is in two halves, an upper and lower half, and they meet on the sides. With the copy I got, there was close to a 1/16"" gap on the right side, so you could see right in, and at best it would be a pain in the behind to keep clean. Another copy might be better but it seems like an unfortunate design."
2,"Heroic effort, but mangled output","I own 12 of the original soundtracks for the themes that are included in this compilation (which are reorchestrations/re-recordings by the City of Prague Philharmonic)... Most of these 12 themes are badly mangled in these recordings... for example, the original Mask of Zorro theme recording is much more precise, dynamic and lyrical than the recording presented in this set.. same is true for Braveheart, etc."
3,Out of print book,"I was surprised to find this book available at such a low price. It has been out of print for quite a while and I was not able to find it at a library in Tucson. Yes, it was used and yes, it had some water stains and yes, it had contained highlighting but all that was in the description so I have no complaint. I was just happy to be able to get a copy."
1,Buyer Beware!,"My daughter absolutely loved this movie when she was young. I think she single-handedly wore out the copy at the local library. Imagine my delight when Amazon.com had it, finally, at a good, affordable price! I was so delighted, that I ordered a copy for her and for us. Unfortunately, this affordable version of the movie won't play on DVD players in America! It's made to play in Europe! I returned both DVD's and was promised a refund. Very disappointed! The version that plays in America is around $40 while this version is $21 and some change. Why the discrepancy?"
4,Family Viewing,I saw this movie when it first came out. It was a good family movie then and it still is a good family movie now. It's a classic.
5,Stunning,"Self-titled. If you're a fan of Sherwood, there's no doubt you're going to enjoy this album."
3,Beach Boys Meet The 21st Century,"Don't get me wrong. This CD has some real bright spots on it. Unfortunately, it also has some very forgetable spots as well. This CD could easily have been trimmed down to 10 songs. That is disappointing because 3 of the best songs on the CD are repeats from The Summer EP, The Song In My Head, Middle Of The Night, The Only Song. The bad part of the length of this CD is that the middle drags, badly. It is difficult to make it to the end, which has two of the better tracks on the disc, A Different Light and I'm Asking Her To Stay. Other brights spots include The Best In Me, For The Longest Time, and Home."
5,i love this cd!!,"this is such a great cdevery song is catchy and gets stuck in my head and i love it!i just got the other cd by them (Sing, But Keep Going) and i cant wait to hear it!!"
4,"Enjoyable Album, nice lyrics","A good album that I enjoyed, with great lyrics. The most memorable song on the album being ""song in my head"" Comparable to Relient K, but less variety. However, Sherwood has figured out their style, and they are good at it, which tends to make up for the repitition of sound in most of the tracks. Can drag in the middle a bit, but all in all a great album. If you have an appreciation for the thoughtful lyrics and well constructed musical style of Relient K and others, you will probably enjoy Sherwood."
4,"Good content, but pages published out of order","I had watched Pablo Casals Master Classes on PBS back in the 1960's, so the book somewhat ""came alive"" for me. As a cellist, I was able to glean some tips that I found useful to my own approach to practice. There are also some concepts that I believe would be easy to incorporate into teaching a student to play the instrument - especially the idea of ""do this"".The only negative remark that I have to make about the copy of the book I got is that the pages are assembled out of order and it took me a while to figure out that I could search through the book to read in sequential order!! (The pages went from 1- 75, followed by 115, 114, 113 ... down to 76, then picks up again at 116 to the end!!!)"
5,"WOW, WOW, WOW, a must-read for any musician.","What an amazing book! I was drawn in from the first page and couldn't put it down. I read Just Play Naturally three times (just to make sure I hadn't missed anything) before I loaned it to my cello teacher.Buy it, read it, share it - maybe even get an extra copy so you have one to keep and one to give away. It's an easy read and a fascinating story that will inspire you and perhaps change your playing forever!"
5,use it ....... everyday.,"Use it in my psp for all my multimedia needs. And I literally use it everyday. Seeing as my car does not have radio, heh!"
5,Excelent product!! great compatibility,I bought this memory stick for my psp and it works great! very fast media and game transfer. it can transfer 2gb in 7 mins!
5,Great stick,This is a great Sandisk MemoryStick.I never have had any problems with SanDiskproducts.I enjoy buying from Amazon because of theirgreat prices and service.
4,Landscaping Made Easy!,"I am enjoying this product. It was not hard to get the basics set up, except for the elevation levels for the terrain. However, with some experimenting and some reading, I was pretty much ""designing"" within a few days (I work, so this was play time). I am not terribly computer savy, but was able, through trial and error, to use the software in a relatively short period of time.Main drawback is the limited number of plants in the menu. Most of the standard plants are available, but I am looking for a download that would bring in additional plants.All in all, I feel that if I can do this, and enjoy it as much as I have, just about anyone can feel confident about buying it. I am pleased."
2,Good consumer product to get rough landscape ideas,"The software was not what I expected. The 3D tools and views are incredible and can give the average person some ideas on how their landscape would look with some new shrubs, trees, deck, etc. However, I needed to use this software to draw 2D sketches for landscape companies. I freelance with small landscape businesses to draw 2D sketches of residential and commercial landscaping proposals. In the 2D view of this software, you are limited to just a handful of shapes to represent trees and shrubs. Such as a small shrub is a small circle and a larger tree is represented by just a larger circle. If I wanted to do that I could have bought a regular drawing program. You will not have any views of the thousands of trees and shrubs available in the program unless you view it in a 3D virtual tour type view. Really not the right fit for me since I need to provide a sheet of paper to my clients who then send it to their customers."
2,Better than nothing!,It was very helpful in planning my landscaping. Getting my home roof correct was tricky and my property has some slope in the front and I had a very hard time making it right. I planted 17 different varities of plants and I found about half of them in their plant directory.
4,Good - not great,"the sofware is pretty easy to use, but does not have many of the plants we use in our area."
4,Excellent Ideas on Consciousness Studies and Meditation,"An excellent set of ideas on psychology and on meditation techniques. Ideas are explained here far more clearly than by most other books and teachers of meditation.Dr. Wolinski draws parallels between eastern meditation techniques and Bohmian quantum theory that seem very speculative. The quantum physics connections are fascinating, but one would be hard pressed to take them literally. If you take them as metaphors, the book then becomes a gold mine of tools for meditation and psychology."
1,Deceptive advertising,"I chose this cocktail strainer over lower cost models when I saw under the Product Description that it is made in Italy. And what do I find when I open the package? A cheap piece of junk made in, get this: China.I cannot help but notice that unscrupulous on-line retailers will sometimes try to pass a 3rd World product off on an unknown, faraway customer by slapping a European-sounding name on it. One would expect better from Amazon."
3,Good But Left Me Wanting,"This book had good technical information/illustrations for building a water garden but I would have liked more information on ideas for pond settings, examples of different types. After reading it, I was looking for another book . . ."
3,"Save your money, buy track 11","Bone Thugs and Bone Thug fans everywhere should be ashamed of this album. Track 11 is nice though and uses the ""yeah"", from the Genuine Pony song, to make for a sick beat. There are a couple of other 'ok' songs but for the most part this CD is garbage... sorry Flesh."
4,1st Bone solo is a nice 1,"i think bsides krayzie, flesh is my fav in bone. he reps cali 2 as well as cleveland. this can b kina boring and flesh is rilly rilly fast rapper. he talks hella pshyco s$^t! he got the wierdest people on this album though. like he does have krayzie, layzie & his group afta maff on it but then he has fat joe, bg knocc out ( that guy who used 2 diss dogg pound ) & off all people reverend run from run-dmc on cruel world. it is a great song though. flesh also has big pun's 1st apperance on a major album. he does the hook on the vicious no mercy. playa hater & northcoast r kinda boring. his illest tracks r # 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ,14 & 15. this was still a great album 2 get ur bang on 2."
5,Tha Cd is good I just wish people would listen to the lyrics,"Tha CD is real good ,they know what they are doing and I believe that they {T.H.U.G.S.] are really reaching out to young people today I know it helped me get thruogh my problems and thruogh the hard facts in life.I'm not saying that I changed my whole life style but the worst things about me have changed because I chose to listen to the lyrics."
5,classic bone,first album from flesh n bone back in 1996...great classic stuff right here. def pick up if your a new bone fan
2,2.5 Stars,T.H.U.G.S. is an okay album but it just doesn't have anything that can give it that extra push. NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,Free Flesh N' Bone!!!!,"Flesh N' Bone was like the sweetest off Bone Thugs next to Bizzy because he had that skill to just have you like oooohhhhh that's hard. He did a great job on his first CD this is like a classic for me. There's alot of a good songs on here like ""Sticks and Stones"", ""Empty The Clip"", and ""World So Cruel"". Great album off da bones archives. A lot of people startin' to think Bone Thugs gettin' too old now but I tell them to hate on the Thuggish Ruggish. This is a must have album. Free Flesh N' Bone and free my cousin Quincy!"
5,unappreciated and under-rated,"It might of been the first solo album by Bone, but it wasn't the best. Flesh is so awesome how he can go from hard raps to soft sung raps, while making his raps flow very fast. It does have some pretty sweet hard songs like ""Mystic Spirits"", ""The Silence isn't Over"" and ""Crazy by the Flesh"". The album opens with a gospel sound which is good to hear, but it didn't set the tone for the rest of the album. Make sure u listen to track #3 were Run from Run DMC gives a good preach."
4,Genius,"Long out of print work of genius from Glasgows best band.If you can get a copy from the used CD's section then DO IT!!Moody,magnificent,slow,evocative,love-lorn songs of infinite charm and beauty,just like all their other albums in fact."
4,"S.C.C., hmmmmm..........","The S.C.C. are'nt that well known to the mainstream , but have been around since 1992 . 1992 when the west coast hip hop scene was largely expanding due to the likes of 2pac , Eazy-E , DJ Quik , MC Eiht, ect ... the S.C.C. were also big contenders at the time [espeically with gangsta convo] . Hip hop was becomming largely popular the S.C.C. which consited of seven members - 3 MC's Prodeje , Havoc , Havikk Rhimeson. Even though S.C.C. have done a video with my loccs B.G. Knocc Out & Dre'sta, rumor has it S.C.C. had been in a fued with Eazy-E, now Havoc & Prodeje have nothing on the E, because they may be wanna be loccs, so S.C.C. are nothing but fools, Jus tah let ya know! Wuhawahahaha!S.C.C.'s best are 1, *2, 3, 4, *7, 9, 10, *11, 12, 13, 14, *15(featuring 2pac, MC Eiht, Ice-T & Spice 1), 17 & 18."
3,Better than nothing.,"This OVA is one story about alternative realities. The story was almost there, but the, ""what if's"" in the infinite universes were too shallow to convince me. The jokes just were not there like they are in the TV series. This movie is still good, just slower moving than other Urusei Yatsura stuff. If you are out of anime to buy, pick this up. It is better than nothing."
3,Controller,Item arrived wrapped in bubble wrap & that's it...item was dirty but my son cleaned it...it wasn't dusty...definitely a well used piece...old rubber band stuck to it...kind of gross but for the price..he was ok with it...
3,Great massage table,"this was an excellent table. Had to return due to fact. Height measurements were incorrect. Stated table would go to 34"". very incorrect !!!!! Only 32"". Amazon was not in the least helpful. It became my problem even though they were wrong, a lot of were sorry with a lack of customer service."
1,Couldn't finish it,I got to page 26 and there weren't any characters that I cared to read any more about. The plot line hadn't grabbed my interest either. I don't have time to waste on books that don't grab me right from the beginning.
2,Big Step Down,"When I discovered this author I quickly bought all his books. I purchased this one in hard cover as soon as it came out. I shouldn't have bothered, this one is not up speed. The book is disjointed and hard to follow and thus, unlike his previous efforts, doesn't hold the reader's attention. I don't mean disjointed in a wacky way that is endearing, I mean disjointed as in bad writing. There are still some laughs but they are few and far between. Some of the evil forces at work are just background noise and you never really have any insight or interest in them. It just kind of limps to a tacky happy ending when the reader has long since lost interest in what's happening. Was the author being too clever by half or is he just running out of steam? I don't know but in the future I'll wait for the paperback version or just hit the library."
2,The Big Bamboo: A Novel,"I am a fan of Tim Dorsey and his works. I stumbled upon him by accident after having read my latest Carl Haiiasen Book, and boy am I glad I did. I was a little disappointed in this book because I felt it lacked the edge that some of his earlier novels had. The ""creative violence"" of Serge just isn't there and the laugh at loud moments are few and far between. Don't get me wrong, you will find very few authors who write with the creativity and twisted humor that Tim does...but this novel is lacking in some of the grit of the first few novels. I like Tim's books because I am a Floridian and when the plot stays within the state, for me personally, it makes for a better read. I hope the next novel gets back to the roots of the first few books."
3,"Not bad, but....",Not as good as his previous books. Hopefully he's not slipping into the mediocrity that Hiassen has fallen into with some of his recent books.
2,Serge Has Finally Jumped The Shark,"If Torpedo Juice was Serge portraying Fonzie strapping on the skis, then The Big Bamboo was DEFINITELY Serge jumping the shark.It was bound to happen. This series, I'm sorry to say, has run out of steam. Ironically enough it's no coincidence that both the television series 'Happy Days' and this novel 'The Big Bamboo' both jumped the shark when they were set in LaLa Land, California. You take your lead characters out of their natural elements and they flounder.Now, I've re-read Torpedo Juice twice and even purchased the novel on CD to see if there was something I was missing. I wasn't. I had the distinct impression that that particular novel was being 'phoned in'. The Big Bamboo suffers from the same malady. Although, this time it was even worse.I looked forward to kicking off the Spring and Summer time with a new Dorsey novel. Alas, I think the ride has finally come to an end.Sorry, Tim. Didn't care for this one."
2,Hard to follow,"Not Tim's best work. I am a huge Serge fan, but this book is really scattered. Not up to the other Serge books"
3,ummm.....,"just a question, but y isn't foxy brown in touch me tease me, cuz in the music video one, she is? why would he cut her out, she made the song?"
3,could have been better,I only enoyed 2 songs from the whole cd and the radio should stop blowing up one of them or I will only like 1
5,My opinion of case and his music.,I am madely in love with Case and mainly with his song Happily Everafter
4,Jacobs Book Review,"Are you ready to rock? ""Fox Be Nimble"" is a toe-tappin', finger-snappin' book. Author James Marshall has written a great book about a guitar-playing fox.Fox loves to play rock star. So, come and be his fan and read his story. It will be music to your ears. Fox only has one person in his audience, his sister, Louise. He has to stop playing music to babysit the Bear's family. He always talks back to his mom.After Fox went to Bear's family, he goes to pracice with the band and finally finds something that he is good at.So, find out, read and keep on rocking!"
5,To Live As Francis Lived: A Guide for Secular Franciscans,"Haven't completed the book by a long shot; however, this text from early on inspires, informs, & guides exceptionally well. It's a wonderful resource for anyone involved in the initial formation of the Secular Franciscan Order. I look forward to using this book as an inspirational ""aide in prayer, & as an aide to establishing a schedule in the pursuit of the Franciscan way of life ~ultimately a closer life with Jesus""."
3,Full of misunderstanding of Japanese culture,"This Cd is featuring a lot of misunderstading of Japanese culture but if your interests are about the typical Japanese image about Japan, this is o.K."
2,Poor design,"It is too top heavy for most golf cart cupholders. We have two carts and I tried it in a friends, and it falls out of the cup holder on all three carts."
5,Perfect for cooler days,it fit perfectly in the cup holder and works great for cooler days. Plan to use it quite a bit.
4,Provides great heat,Heater provides a lot of heat for its size and with the cup holder adapter works in most any cart
2,Not Enough Heat,"This thing does not fit most golf cart cup holders, it's too big and top heavy. Also 3,000 BTU just is not enough heat to do much."
4,A must for winter golf.,This allows me to play golf even on cold days. Just put on cart cover and go. Makes you not want to get out of cart.
5,Much better design than my old one,"I love this heater, it's so easy to light compared with my old one. No more wrapping your arm around while lighting and pushing a button, and HOPING you don't catch you arm on fire.Great heat output, in fact it's super hot on high. Keeps me warm and toasty in the golf cart during the winter."
4,Keeps your hands warm,"I purchased this unit because our group of guys tee off at 6:45AM each week and in the cold weather, my old hands get a bit stiff and sore. Riding in an open cart I didn't expect it to warm my body inside the cart, and it doesn't, but my second time using it was on a cold, blustery morning with intermittant rain and my partner and I were hovered over it between shots all morning long. Worked great at keeping hands warm and drying damp gloves. One propane cylinder lasted about six hours on the high setting. Well worth having and it will get regular use throughout the winter."
5,fun in my golf car,love the heater i play golf with it in 40 degree tem. with my golf car encloser down it realy helps.also me and my wife like to take rides with the golf car and it helps on cold days makes it more fun.
2,discontent,product came with a broken start button and I called Coleman and after much discussion they informed me that I must distroy the product and sent it back at my expense. It only needed a 10 cent button and they do not have those in stock. My last Coleman product from a Company with such a poor business model.
5,golf cat heater,This product is easy to use and is perfect for keeping us warm in our golf cart. It is exactly what I expected. It cools off faster than what the instructions say for storage. The carry bag makes it very easy to store when not in use.
3,Coleman GolfCat Catalytic Heater,"Heats great, but it doesn't fit into my golf cart cup holders. I had to makeshift something with wedges, but there is so much weight on top that it is dangerous and I haven't been able to use it."
3,Good Heat,It keeps my cart nice and worm in the coldest weather. The only problem is it can be hard to light.
5,Easy to use. Well made.,I love it. Great for warming in golf cart on cold day. Well constructed and designed. Case is very handy.
2,didn't fit,"These ""fitted sheets"" didn't fit my crib's mattress.I tryed to return them, but they didn't answer me.My mattress is a standard size, so I don't understand.I am not satisfied at all."
4,Very useful,"I solder circuit boards and this baby comes in real handy. It holds the board steady while I do my work and although I detached the magnifying glass I still use it to inspect my work afterwords. Great price and it has a nice heavy base as well. Of course there are higher quality ones out there but this fit my needs just fine. I don't know why amazon considers this a toy. They wanted me to rate how fun it was?? Ok..it was a blast, I can't wait to go play with it some more."
5,used to help solder wires and fix small parts,"Although this is advertised as a toy, it has been used as a tool to help hold small things and solder them. It has really been a big help with the small things we use it for (mainly electronics). The clamps are good strength and do not smash the item they are holding, and the magnifier is very handy as well.They only thing that could make this any better would be a LED light attached to it, but it is not necessary."
3,Helping Hands,Fantastic idea. Its a good product and value for it's intended purpose. I wish it could offer more flexibility in terms of arms length but you could not go wrong for the price.
1,Not Practical,This is not a practical design. The Hands the other connectors should be tightened always to stay in place.I am returning this product.
3,Assembly Instructions?,"This arrived in 7 pieces with no assembly instructions. Not only that, there's not even a picture of it fully assembled on the box. I had to come back to the product page to see what the thing looks like so I can attempt to put it together. Boo!"
3,Decent for the cost,"It is pretty good overall. The base is heavy enough, the clamps are are strong and the pivot points stay in place.The clamps are held on by friction. They regularly loosen up and need to be given a squeeze with pliers. While the base is heavy, it could be a bit wider. I wish the arms were a bit longer."
2,Came short one clip...,"The unit showed up short one alligator clip with ball joint, so I guess it's not a 'Dual' unit after all. Amazon couldn't provide the missing part although they did suggest I return it for full credit or get partial credit for loss, but since it wasn't theirs they could not provide the missing part. Thanks Amazon, but the need was urgent and so I took it and the partial credit and kludged an alternative solution. The Magnifier is sort of useless and smaller then I thought it would be, maybe with a longer arm, but the rest did the job with some kludging of a second clip."
4,helpimg hands,"If you're into the flying and maintenance of RC helicopters or planes...it's a must to have it.changing of small parts is tedious at best. Helping hand's holds the unit in place while you work, plus magnifying the piece you're working on."
