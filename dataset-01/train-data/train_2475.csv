5,The First and Only Book on Choosing Your Book's Best Title,"Thius is the first and only book to help authors with selecting an appropriate ""selling"" title for a book they have written. As a good title can sometimes make or break a book, book titling is often a critical factor in its success...........--Nat Bodian, author"
4,desert strom 2,"product was good no problem there, only took to long to recieve item that I purchased another one. Thank God they were out of stock or I would had two of the same game."
4,Warm and Nicely Done!,"If you were to buy a release by Mustard's Retreat, this may be the one, since it highlights their strength: live performance. I have witnessed around 30-40 of them dating back to 1979, in their days in the bars and pubs of Flint, MI, and their warmth is nicely captured here.Typical of their song selection is: 'Part Of Me Remembers', a sincere but not sappy song about loss that always brings a tear to my eyes; 'Detroit 1763', a first-person documentary which is among many they cull from Michigan history; and 'One Meatball', just one example of their great sense of humor.Whether you're a folk purist or more of a pop-music fan, ANY Mustard's Retreat release will have something for you, but this one is still probably their all-around best!"
4,Compact and to the point!,"When I received this book my first thought was, ""It's a large phamphlet!"" Well it is only 101 pages, including the index, but its packed with info and wonderful detailed anatomy drawings! The author walks you thru the different hysterectomy procedures step by step, from your initial doctor visit before your surgery to your post-op follow up visit and a bit beyond. She also answers questions you didn't even know you had. It is written in UK language, which just means when you get to the part about the hospital staff, the names will sound strange, example: ""The sister, staff nurse, junior sister, charge nurse, consultant, junior doctors..etc."" and their health insurance system is not the same as ours. But everything else translates the same. There are even diagrams and instructions for post-op exercises. It's an easy read, and I loved the comments from the women (who had been there and done that) at the beginning of each chapter!"
4,"Good book, with limitations.","A useful book. Contains information about what to expect from hysterectomy surgery. Especially useful if you have never been hospitalized or had any procedure. It is a bit dated in that it doesn't cover some newer techniques such as all-laproscopic hysterectomy. The book discusses alternatives to hysterectomy only lightly. Before making the decision, it would be helpful to read ""Do You Really Need Surgery?: A Sensible Guide to Hysterectomy and Other Procedures for Women"" by Michele C. Moore and Caroline M. De Costa; and ""A Gynecologist's Second Opinion: The Questions & Answers You Need to Take Charge of Your Health"" (Second Edition, Revised) by Parker."
1,Los retos internacionales de MÃ©xico,"The book says that Mexico lost its way, adrift at a time when the international order is particularly uncertain because of the crisis that shakes and changes in global coordinates, the axis moved to China. Moreover, the foreign policy of President Felipe Calderon lacks a comprehensive project, which identifies priorities and set goals and strategies to achieve them-in the most important bilateral relationship for the country: the United States. I think most of the essays has no empirical data to sustain their assumptions. I feel authors fails, and instead of doing some good to human thought and Mexican hopes for a better life, brings more destruction to the already damaged social web."
4,Great Caribbean/Funk Music,"Monty Alexander is one great pianist. Most of his music is jazz based with a hint of the islands. That all changed with his last release in which he covers some of Bob Marley's most popular songs. That CD is a great amalgamation of island and jazz music. It's a must just as ""Monty Meets Sly and Robbie"" is. It works on many levels. The rhythms are bouncy enough to clean the apartment to yet the depth of the piano solos make it perfect to sit down and really listen to. Great stuff!"
2,A great pianist plays to dull accompaniment,"I don't understand that Monty Alexander has released this CD.Monty's play is outstanding. The rhythm section, however, sounds like the auto-accompaniment feature of some run-of-the-mill keyboard.I don't know any other Sly+Robbie recordings. Perhaps they are better elsewhere. On THIS CD, however, they are less than mediocre.Mercy, Mercy is a good example for this.5 stars to Monty's play.zero stars to Sly+RobbieTherefore, 2 stars to the CD overall."
2,Rarely Rises Above Annoying,"Although Alexander's previous Telarc effort, a tribute to the music of Bob Marley, had at times a cocktail jazz feel to it, it was musically entertaining. This one, however, on which Alexander is joined by the veteran reggae rhythm section of Sly Dunbar on drums and Robbie Shakespeare on bass, rarely rises above the merely annoying. How three veteran musicians could combine to produce such claptrap is something I just cannot quite understand. Although the sound is quite punchy and will give an audiophile's system a good workout, neither reggae fans nor jazz fans are likely to find anything of musical value here, so I would advise both groups to pass on this one."
2,Big Disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this CD. The combination of these three musicians wetted my appetite when I read about this release. With the exception of ""Chameleon"" and ""People Make The World Go Round,"" this is nothing more than juiced up elevator music. I have enjoyed Monty's previous recordings including the Marley cover, but this one goes into the used bin. If you really want to hear the essence of Monty's music - look no further than an earlier recording ""Jamento"" - it is drop dead beautiful."
2,"Woah, I've just woken up after listening to Monty & co","The first 30 lame seconds of the album is a ominous warning of whats to come on this mediocre album. I mean what a shockingly uninspired intro. At first I was going to totally slate it in my review, but to be fair a few tracks have a feel-good factor. There are definitely some nice keyboard touches ..... but that about sums it up - its pretty much a one trick act. 'Riddim Section Kings' Sly and Robbie are way-more legend than substance and you are lucky if you can pick out a live-drum sound apart from the occasional lazy (but nice) big rimshot, and the bass lines a 10 year old could play - I mean come on guys liven it up a bit and shove in a bit more effort for crisakes. Laid back - its positively horizontal. I bought this on the off chance - I had a feeling something wicked was in the offing - It ain't. In future I'll stick to the fusion boys offerings, like the The Billy Cobhams of this world."
3,Baby Snoopy's Valentine,"Not much of a story, but very cute layout with Snoopy and heart shaped pages."
3,Good stuff but don't be misled,"Those of you more observant than I will have already deduced that this is NOT a collaboration between Charlie Christian and Dizzy Gillespie, with Monk thrown in for good measure. It is part Charlie Christian album (tracks 1-5) and part Dizzy Gillespie album (6-9) with Monk playing on TWO of the Christian tracks, and not very noticeably (or even audibly) on either of them. The recording quality is adequate, about how you'd expect a live 1941 jazz club recording to sound; doesn't ruin the album, but is hard to ignore at times. Plenty of great music here, far ahead of its time, and especially a fascinating showcase for Christian away from his more (relatively) conventional work with Benny Goodman, and in the final year of his too-short life. This is the sound of bebop being born, and worth it for that alone, but if you were expecting an all-star session like I was, you've been warned."
2,great music very poor quality recording,Although the music is clearly amazing the recording quality is so bad it really shouldn't even be on the market but if you want to hear Christian play some great solos it is just worth it but be prepared.
2,"Hostels USA, 3rd edition","Don't buy this edition.maybe the next one will be better.That is, if they list Hostel website addresses,list the States in Alphabetical order,put in an INDEX at the end of the bookand a postcard for travelers to send updates!This guide's big attraction is its ""quotes"" of on-site people,and authors' ""opinions"". The authors should date the entries.Otherwise the assumption is that the authors were recently thereand that's not the case!Lonely Planet, and Let's Go, guidebooks don't allow their'scouts' to accept gratuities from Hostel Owners...it'd be nice to see that statement from this guide."
4,What a marvelous tool for traveling the U.S. ... cheaply!,This book is a must have for travelers looking for cheap lodgings. This book offers fabulous advice on everything from cheap eats to local sights. Cannot begin to say enough great stuff about this book!
4,Comprehensive and immensely-helpful.,"""Hostels U.S.A."" is a comprehensive and immensely-helpful guide to over 300 hostels in the U.S. and some of Canada.Evan Halper and Paul Karr not only write candid appraisals on each accommodation, they give prices, star-ratings, addresses (including email!), number of private rooms, and apropos icons (Attractive Natural Setting, Good for Business Travelers, Romantic Private Rooms, etc).At the start of the guide, the writers explain to us what exactly a hostel is (no, it's not a hospice or a drunk tank).And in the back of the book, Halper and Karr put the hostels into enormously-practical groupings--e.g., Best Beach Hostels, Great Value Hostels, Best Hostels for Skiers, and Most Romantic Hostels).""Hostels U.S.A."" is a laudable addition to both your knapsack and your briefcase."
5,Has helped with my travel plans.,"I recently purchased the Hostel USA. Great guide for hostels. In particular, the party hat rating lets the reader know if the hostel atmosphere will be loud or more on the quiet side. Thank you so much for that."
5,"helps me pick the best hostels, every time....","I have bought the fourth and fifth edition of this book, and am eagerly awaiting the sixth edition. I have used this book to select a youth hostel in both Los Angeles and San Francisco and was delighted with the results. Also used the book to help my brother plan a road trip across the country so he could see all the baseball stadiums, and he was very happy with the results as well. The book gives detailed descriptions on each hostel, so you know how many people you'll be sharing a room with, the international/U.S. ratio, whether or not there will be a lot of partying or if it's quiet, and let's you know the surrounding area. The books is also well written and fun to read.I hope to travel to Portland and Seaside Oregon soon and stay in the hostels recommended in the book. I just wish I could find a book that is just as good to help me find places to stay during my trip to Mexico which will be this summer."
3,Ivank,"Well, I made a sort of mistake when I purshased this item. I thought it was the last piece from BA and I was waiting his bluesy songs with some aroma of funk , but oh! this is crispy funky music. He has better productions and the blues is his forte not funky music...is what I think."
3,Channeling Rick James,"Yes, Bernard did funk it up on this one. It's an OK diversion, almost a tribute to Rick James and his influence, and most of this disc is listenable. I also prefer more straight-ahead blues or blues-rock from him, and having seen him live several times, his audiences seem to prefer it as well. Avoid the last track: I'm no prude, but dropping the f-bomb a few too many times just seems old and uninspired."
1,A real disappointment!,"Having seen Bernard Allison live on many different occations, I know him as a great blues/rock/funk player. This cd is a real disappointment because it sounds more like disco/funk and I was expecting to hear some of Bernard's great guitar licks which are just not present on this cd. If I were Bernard, I would want to forget that I recorded this one."
3,Blah,Not very creative at all. This book fails to engage in a unique way. There are so many other books that do a much better job teaching colors.
2,Very simple,"Each page has the color in English and Spanish, with no other words, so there is no plot, no rhymes. There are better books to teach colors."
2,Cute but inaccurate,"My daughter loves looking at the pictures in this book, but whoever wrote it doesn't actually speak Spanish. The book translates orange as ""naranja,"" but that refers to the fruit; the correct word for the color is ""anaranjado."" It also uses ""violeta"" for purple, but that means ""violet;"" the more accurate word would be ""morado"" or ""pÃºrpura."""
2,"Using ASP.NET, a Bit","What a disappoitment!...this book is full of errors. I'm not talking of trivial errors either, but of the jaw-dropping variety. For instance, in chapter 7, the author keeps referring to the web.config file as ""config.web"". Additionally, I've already come across several other major errors in the code examples, more than found in the online errata section. I guess listing them all would be too embarrassing!Sure, the book is an easy read. It's an easy read because it's neither in-depth, nor detailed. Often, a lot of concepts in the code examples are never explained properly.Using ASP.NET??? If you use this book, the errors and the lack of in-depth coverage will leave you dazed, you will end up with more questions than answers, and you will soon be looking for a better book to help you learn ASP.NET in earnest."
1,Don't purchase unless you use it on a computer,"I am soooo disappointed. I heard this was the best DVD on Crosby, Stills, & Nash.I am unable to play this DVD on any DVD player I have. I have a sony, zenith,and a panasonic. The only place it will play is on the computer. The DVDs do not recognize the region it is from. On the computer I was able to click on a region outside of the USA and it worked. It is not a lot of fun watching a concert on a computer. I wish there was something I could do like return it but I didn't play it until I had time a month or so after purchase."
2,FAN OF GOOD SOUND,"IT WAS INTERESTING TO VIEW THIS ONCE, I GUESS THEY CAN SAY ANYTHING IS IN 5.1 HOWEVER I DON'T THINK THIS IS WORTH ANOTHER LISTON."
2,Never Before Released?,"This is the same 60 minute program that was released on VHS in 1990, and shown on cable TV. It's pretty sleazy of them to try to pass this off as something new. At least they could have added some extras, or expanded it. That said, there is some good stuff on here, but the concert material is mostly from the 80's, and it's so frustrating when they show only half of a vintage TV performance of ""You Don't Have To Cry"" with Neil Young-it is the best thing on there! Also, they could have included the full Woodstock performance, instead of only two songs. This is one opportunity that was wasted on the way...."
2,disappointing,"I bought this DVD with great anticipation and came away very disappointed. The two tracks that I wanted to view the most were For ""What It's Worth"" and ""Down By The River"". Both tracks were cut up by interviews. I haven't found ""Down By The River"" anywhere on DVD and thought I finally had found this great song. When a DVD is made about a groups history it would be nice if all the complete songs were included. I had the same bad experience with an ABBA DVD I recently purchased.Some of the music was great but again you would think that the interviews could be placed on the DVD after the song was over"
3,+ 1/2 stars...For Romantics Only,"This Elvis Valentine's Day offering is certainly less fattening than a box of chocolates, but is it less filling too? To keep with the romantic theme of this latest collection, only about half of these songs were hits so the rest of the songs are album tracks. Some of these are gems (""Fever""), but some are clunkers (""Hawaiian Wedding Song"" from BLUE HAWAII). And where are the hits like ""Love Me"" or ""(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such As I""?The bottom line is, if you're looking for a greatest hits collection there are better choices available. And for the serious Elvis collector, the only previously unreleased cut here is an alternate take of the Kris Kristofferson-penned ""For the Good Times."" But if you're in the market for a terrific collection of some of Elvis' best love songs--and the famous Alfred Wertheimer photo of Elvis tongue-kissing a girl backstage on the cover--this won't disappoint."
4,another mixed bag?,"How long does a sex symbol last? Isn't it time to seaze repackaging and stick to re-releasing? Those are the questions one'd likely pose to RCA Victor. With everything he has been to America and the world to date - Elvis is the last artist on the roster to benefit from this 20-something ad-hoc tracks culled from dozen original sources. OK, it's a brilliant remaster to bring out yet new dynamics in ""Are You Lonesome..."" and the booklet texture feels silky stylish, but what's definitely missing is His singularity. Mundane ""Surrender"" takes place where fancier ""Suspicion (torments my heart)"" should've been. Few live recordings (again and umpteenth time!) virtually ruin the studio homogenity of this - predominantly studio - collection. No, it's not THAT bad. No one can take Elvis material and come up with an offhand product. But it stand no chance in the store against a ""two Elvis albums on 1 CD"" thing. Remaster or no remaster."
3,"great CD, distasteful cover","Elvis' love songs are beautifully rendered on this CD. The only problem is that the front cover of the CD is not as advertised. Rather, the CD I received from Amazon had the cover shown at[...] I suppose one could print a new cover from the appropriate image!"
3,Swim at your own risk,"This movie for me was just ok. I am a devoted horror fan, but if I had to say what my least liked type of horror flick is, it is zombies. Granted there are a few good ones that I really do like, this one still falls just average. This depicts some beautiful scenery and good makeup effects, but no story. I didn't get the dead people steadily walking up from out of the lake. Why? This needed more of a story. The very end is strange, I wasn't quite sure how to interpret that."
3,Above average horror flick.,I thought the story was interesting and the actors were good. But they could of work more on the special effects.
1,I love zombie movies but....,"Where the Hell are the zombies??? This movie lacked in every aspect. It had low action and poor acting. I couldn't wait for the movie to end, I'm glad I picked it up for 4.00 and NOT the Amazon price of over 20.00. JUNK!"
1,"Do not listen to editors review, it's HORRIBLE","This is an absolutely terrible movie. I am a huge horror movie fan and love a great low-budget, cheesy, horror flick, but this is not even close to camp. Horrible story, terrible acting, bad writing. Nothing was good about this!I have no clue what the ""editor"" was thinking, or anyone else who gave this a positive review. I ordered it based on those, and am HORRIBLY disappointed on how poorly they misled me (us).Do not bother!"
3,A treasure for storytellers,"I like short stories, but this a special genre: a collection of mysteries of one or two pages about World War II. The author is an historian, the collection is fantastic, but the reading is a bit frustrating, because there is no character description,no development, just the bare facts.If you are a WWII buff, it in an interesting addition for your collection: I bet that even historians do not know half of theses stories.Any novelist without a subject would find here a treasure: any of these stories would make a great novel.However, if you are just an ordinary reader like me, it falls short: it is collection of small interesting facts, but there is no meat."
3,There are better.,"I had wanted this machine for about 3 years. I finally decided to get one in Stainless. It is absolutely gorgeous! It is such a fine ascetically pleasing design. I love the toggle switches. Fit and finish are wonderful.I had it for about a year. Unfortunately it was only good at making espresso with pods. It was an awful steamer and I drink mostly milk based drinks.I ended up with the Rancilio Silvia. It is a night and day difference. The Silvia a ""real"" machine. Better tasting espresso, much, much better steamer ending in a tremendous product.If you want a beautiful piece of equipment siting on your counter and are not too into coffee, one a week or so, I'd recommend getting this. Otherwise look else where for a good grinder and a good machine. I'd recommend the Silvia as the best you'll find under $800."
3,"Good, no great at Espresso, Poor at Cappuccino","This machine is well made and has a user-interface that my destructive wife can handle without breaking anything; although she did scratch it on day 2 using a dish sponge :(The system is well suited for espresso but its steamer is next to worthless. That is unless you enjoy having milk sprayed all over the machine itself and never really foaming up the milk. Yikes!If you want only espresso, this is a great machine.If you want espresso and cappuccino, get something else."
1,Poorly constructed,"Don't believe the hype about ""quality brass components"". The pump on my machine died after one year of daily use in the morning. The temperature gauge on the front stopped working a few months prior to that. Don't repeat my mistake of being wooed by the styling on this machine."
2,A disappointment,"I agree with the reviews. I wanted it for a couple of years, bought a limited-edition color, Sea Mist Green.All was OK for the first year, though the coffee could have been hotter.Then, the steamer broke. I spent $40 getting it repaired, and when it returned I discovered the authorized repair center chipped the paint.No offer of any kind of refund, of course. I was a less than happy camper. Needless to say, they couldn't send a replacement, as the color was limited edition.OK, so I used it for another year. Then, guess what? The steamer broke AGAIN.So, now it sits pretty on the kitchen counter, and I make coffee with another brand; any other brand."
4,What can you say? It's a $40 bracket,"What can you say? It's a $40 bracket.It would have been nice , given the system's price, to have it be easier to swap, or come with or have the feature built into the trainer.But it wasn't and I bought it anyway.Made my 16"" folder into a whizbang folding stationary bike.How cool could that be?"
4,"It works great, once adjusted","This purchase was for a modification to the cycleops trainer for my wife's recumbent that has 20 inch wheels. It required disassembly and a call to customer service.Saris (cycleops parent company), had a very unorthodox way to dis assemble the unit by breaking the plastic knob.The purchase was great and very easy."
1,What the Heck???,"These games are not compatible with Windows XP and I've noticed there's no way to send scathing e-mails to EA through their website, so I'm venting here. It looks like I'll be purchasing the ""Tycoon"" line of games and sending this trash back to EA, refund or not. Just having these discs in my house is making my computer sad."
1,How to waste 2 hours of your Life,"I have never bought such a piece of [...]product before, and I've been buying software for 25 years now. None of the games worked on my family's PC's (Windows XP, and compatability adjusted 2000 fix didn't work).If you want the patches to fix the games, you need to sign up with a third-party service that makes you pay for the download (I didn't bother).The best part was having SimCity 3 ask for a serial number on the back of the jewel case, and....you guessed it, no serial number or instructions in the readme regarding the same!Electronic Arts used to be a fine corporation, but this product is further proof such companies don't mind making idiots out of customers like me. I agree with the previous post, I will buy Tycoon products for my kids from this point forward."
1,Five really bad games and one that's pretty good,"Most of the games in this pack are either terrible or won't run on your PC. The only one that is any good is Sim Golf, and you can get that separately. The other five games combined aren't worth a dollar, several of them wouldn't even run on either of my computers because they have such compatability issues with Windows."
5,Excellent Start! Well Done,"I bought this c.d. at borders, cause I had heard their ""dumb Pop Song"" on the radio. Little did i know, that the ""Dumb Pop Song"" wouldn't be the only good song on the c.d.! Bottom line is these guys Rock and you should expect to hear many great things from these guys, their ska type music is just kickin'."
1,garbage,"great product if you like blurry pictures, and on a 4x6 print the image is the size of a quarter, dont waste your money"
2,Not that much good,"Well .Not that much ,what I am except ,Not cheap .Not big ,Very normal oil ,Better looking at some where else"
3,"Great content, weak acoustics","I'm very fond of Cal (not Carl) Tjader's music and own a half dozen albums of his. Although I really enjoyed the arrangments and the playing on this disc, it sounds as if the microphones were too far away from the musicians during the recording.This is not uncommon with live recordings from this era, several Charlie Parker albums disappoint in this dimension as well. One could only wish for a time machine to go back and rerecord because the music was right and the bands were tight.For anyone considering a purchase, listen to the samples before purchasing. Or order something more recent from Cal. He was one of the greats and we owe a lot to him for popularizing Latin music way ahead of his time!"
4,Historical Fiction,"I just finished reading ""Two Ladies from Boston"" written by a niece of the late second Mrs. Curley and found it a fascinating tale. I thought it would be strictly a woman's type novel, but it held my attention from start to finish. As a historical fiction novel about the times Curley lived in, it was an excellent and revealing incite into the inner working of the family as well as the politics of the time. I would recommend it to anyone, especially anyone that has had any association with the Curley mystique."
3,History Lesson,"I purchased this book in hopes that it would have a lot of information on Siege weapons and how they were used. The first thing I realized is that this book has a great deal of writing for such a small book and it gives detailed descriptions on the history and background of several Siege Weapons. There are some really nice illustrations in the book as well, however I was hoping for a bit more. I would have liked to have seen more information on how these weapons were constructed and some heads up comparisons of the various Siege weapons. It's certainly a nice historical reference for the Siege enthusiast."
4,Fenomenales armas Bizantinas,"Excelente informaciÃ³n sobre las armas bizantinas, islÃ¡micas e indias, aunque desde mi punto de vista, faltaron algunas armas bizantinas y mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n en dibujos."
4,Buena informacion,Buena informacion relacionada con las armas de asedio de la Edad Media. Sin embargo faltÃ³ un poco mÃ¡s sobre trebuchet y tipos de trebuchets.
5,Crabbie Sandbox,"Great toy for the backyard. Gives my granddaughter the opportunity to use her imagination. Her favorite character is Ariel and the crab reminds her of Sabastian. The unit is heavy enough to be durable, but light enough to be easy to set up. I like the cover, it keeps the rain, the leaves and the dogs out of the sandbox when not in use."
5,Luke & Landen's sandbox,"Great sandbox...very durable, roomy for two toddlers, colorful and at a great price. Every toddler should have one of these."
4,Great ... for a sandbox,"I wouldn't have wanted one smaller than the Crabbie ... it's not huge, but in comparison to others, this is a good/great size.We've yet to have a problem with rain/water getting in (have had it about 4mos) and didn't bungee cord it down as it appears others have. The cover seems to do just fine on it's own for us (even through some pretty severe wind/rain storms).And you definitely do not need to fill the box to capacity (and spend the extra $$$). We filled it about 1/2 way for our 2-year old and believe me, there's enough sand in there for him to make a sandy mess!"
5,Sandbox Fun,This sandbox is adorable. Very durable and so far the lid has not taken flight. Kids of all ages have been attracted to the sandbox. Hours of great fun. Pretty roomy it's ideal for two toddlers but I've seen more try to climb in. Enjoy.
5,great product!,"my two boys really love this sandbox. there is enough room inside for a 4 year old and a 1 1/2 year old to play with trucks and buckets and things like that. the lid keeps out the rain and we didn't have any trouble with spiders or any other kinds of bugs with the lid on every night. i definately reccomend this to anyone. we do not have it in the direct sun, but it has not faded and looks brand new and it's been close to a year now."
1,HOOT,"MY daughter really wanted this movie and it was scratched very badly, I was disappointed that her Christmas gift was such poor quality"
1,"Sorry, But...","In the fifth grade, our teachers showed this movie to us on DVD as a special activity in celebration of Valentine's Day. I cannot really remember the film very well, because I was too busy clowning around at the back of the room with a few classmates in order to avoid having to watch it. It just did not capture my interest. Years later, I went online and read about the summary of the book and concluded that I really had not missed out on something that I would regret having missed out on, since it's just another little-guy-against-big-corporation story. I am very sorry if I've offended anybody with my critique of this film, because it is fine with me if you love it; I just did not. Also, I apologize to the makers of this film if I have insulted them, and also to the author who wrote ""Hoot"" if this review has or would offend him. It just didn't interest me, I am verry sorry to say."
3,THESE KIDS GIVE A HOOT,"HOOT is one of those irresistibly corny films about kids wanting to save an endangered species, and challenged by a bunch of incompetent adversaries.Based on the young adult book by crime writer Carl Hiaasen, the movie has its charms, mainly in the gorgeous Florida scenery, and a charmingly corny performance by Luke Wilson. Tim Blake Nelson is around to chew up the scenery and there are hardly any cliches avoided in this family friendly film. Hiaasen's book does give the characters some humorous situations and dialogue and Jimmy Buffett's score is sprite and lively. It's not a classic by any means but it's entertaining enough."
4,hoot,"fun movie for kids and adults. humorous, educational, kids get to triumph over environmental trashers, appealing leads. a relief to find an intelligent movie we can enjoy together that is neither insipid nor loaded with the usual bad language, nudity, violence. hope more of carl hiaasen's books go the movie route."
4,Hoot (DVD),Used this DVD with students who read Hiaasen's book at school. We liked the script-to-video feature with scene by scene transcription for comparing the book to the movie. The actors portrayed the great characters well. Very funny and fairly true to the book.
1,No respect for Dads - not like the book at all,"In the book the dad is an intelligent, supportive figure - it is he who reviews the building department file and discovers a key to stopping construction. In the movie they give the credit for this completely to the son. In the movie the father is a less-than-supportive stereotyped authority figure who isn't all that bright. Typical Hollywood - put down the father figure at every opportunity."
3,Not Enough Of The Owls,"I was disappointed with this movie. I anticipated seeing a lot of the owls because, after all, saving them was what the movie was about. Very few scenes included them. Otherwise, the movie was okay. I did appreciate the fact that it was made for families and was a wholesome film without the usual foul language and violence that most of today's films are full of."
5,We loved it,"I know that this movie didn't do well in the box office and I read tha bad reviews, but we loved it. We live in South Florida and it was cool that the movie took place here. We read the book and my son LOVED it. This one and Flush are GREAT books. They actually helped my sons writing in that it showed him how to incorporate humor and his own personality in this writing. We loved the books, we loved the movie!"
4,This stuff rocks!,"This body wash has a fresh, clean, spiced scent to it, and I really like it a lot! I'm not a fan of the little bottle it comes in though; such a small, hard bottle kinda makes for aggravation when trying to dispense it from the frickin' bottle!"
5,Matt's the best,"Matt worked on several shoots for me while he was assisting one of the top photographers in the country. Matt's knowledge of his craft was exceptional. He was the consummate professional in every aspect. One of his finest qualities was to be tireless, or appear to be while on the job. Working long hours, he never complained about the ridiculous tasks being asked of him and always offering suggestions on how to improve a shot. Every assistant could learn something good from this remarkable person."
5,One of Willie's best but also among his most underrated.,"This original 1981 release features the lead vocals of Junior Toledo, Bobby Concepcion and Guillo Rivera. Its main highlights include the swinging Salsa dance jams ""La Maldad"", ""Ataca"", ""Que Bonito Es Puerto Rico"" and ""Recordando A Miguelito Valdes"". Junior Toledo also performs a very much respectable cover of the classic Tito Rodriguez bolero ""Quien Lo Diria"". Despite its not having been one of Willie's strongest sellers its now available on CD and well worth buying."
4,The road to resistance,"An absorbing autobiography of George Millar. It tells of his early life and also covers his wartime adventures as described in his earlier books, "" Horned Pigeon"" and "" Maquis."" If you have read those earlier books you will really like this one."
4,No problems at all,The item was sent within the time that I was told it would be delivered and it came in the condition advertised. I had no problems at all.
2,Very dissapointed,"Park does a very good job of exploring different bidding strategies. Theory is debatable of course, but Park does not develop a format in which to capture historical data. That is left to the reader. His software package is supposed to help the bidder develop a system to organize historic records and prepare bidding strategies accordingly. I found his software hopelessly outdated. The software package packaged with the book doesn't even recognize up and down arrow keys. You must turn off the numbers lock and use the old keypad arrows to make his software work. The software really needs to be updated, the theory better explained, and the price of the book brought back to reallity."
3,Above Average Old-School Slayer,"I've only heard three songs off this album, but from what I could gather it sounds like a high energy, thrashy, old-school Slayer style band. Definitely check them out if you like that kind of stuff."
2,disappointed,"This book is libravox recording. All Libravox recordings are in the public domaine, and can be downloaded for free. It is preposterous to charge for this product when it is available for free already"
3,"Good book, not as advertised","The book arrived not as the picture above, but as a paperback, a Signet Classic.I could have bought this paperback at a local bookstore. The rating would have been higher if it was as pictured."
5,"An up-to-date travelogue, sort of!","I started reading this book while I was traveling with a large group. Mark Twain's observations from 140 or so years ago ring true today! I enjoyed reading it. There were many laugh out loud moments and great descriptions. You feel like he is living today. although a lot of descriptions of the people are what we now know are biased, this is nevertheless a fascinating read."
4,Delightful,"What a step back in time this read was and especially wonderful if you have visited any of the places that Mark Twain traveled on his long voyage around the world. You can picture yourself strolling the deck of his steamer ship and walking the pathways of each town visited. Especially delightful was the interaction of his traveling companions and the various tour guides they hired, not so different today! Would have liked to be on this trip....."
5,The Innocents Abroad,"This classic is extrenmely engaging. In particular, looking at travel as compared to current day. I am still into the book but look forward to its continuation."
3,Novice traveller,"Having travelled throughout Europe on tours, I found the references to sites fun as they haven't changed in 150 years. He uses sarcasm a lot as was his style. But some of his humor is racist as you may expect for the times, so references to some ethnic groups is tasteless and awfully inappropriate."
4,Very Insightful!,"For those of us who love to travel the seven seas, and partake of the mighty monster floating resorts that pass for cruise lines these days, its so interesting to read and learn about how passengers 150 years ago had to go about sailing to far off lands. Wow! A real eye-opener. The book is a bit long and slow in some parts but I think it's all necessary to truly paint the picture of what a passenger on an ocean liner in the 1800's would have experienced. It also illustrates what a true storyteller Mr. Twain really was."
5,Heavy - Great Quality,"We purchased three of these pans (two for gifts) in December. They are real heavy duty Calphalon. Our first brownie batch was the best ever - they fell right out of the pan, and cleanup consisted of a couple of wipes with the sponge. You won't be disappointed !!!"
2,FORGOT TO MENTION,INSTALLATION CAN BE A NIGHTMARE FOR XP.....THE PROMPTS ARE AMBIGOUS AND CONFUSING TO ME......IF YOU HAVE XP YOU NEED TO STOP SHORT AT A CERTAIN POINT OF INSTALLATION OR ELSE OU WON'T BE ABLE TO UNINSTALL......NOT PURE PLUG AND PLAY
2,DEAD WOBBLY,"TOO WOBBLY AT STEERING CENTER, DEAD ZONE NOT NARROW ENOUGH.....FEELS LIKE THE SUSPENSION AND STEERING IS FALLING APART....NOT AS GOOD AS THRUSTMASTER FEEDBACK"
4,Can't miss,Adds an extra element to any driving game. Even Nascar2 can be fun again. Only real negatives are pedals like to move and shifter knobs should be designed a little different. Both are easily overcome.
2,NOT FOR WIN2000,"If you're buying this wheel with thoughts of using it with Win2000...Don't! You will not be happy with trying to set it up and Microsoft even admits that they don't support this wheel with Win2000. It was designed for Win98se and that is that. Seems really dumb on their part not to provide current drivers for this wheel. Some upgrade!I finally got the wheel to work, but without the Force Feedback. Wasted money."
4,"Very pretty, but won't work as an accent salad plate.","I bought these plates as an alternative to my butlers pantry salad plates for a wedding shower. The plates are very beautiful, with a raised edge. They are great on their own, but do NOT work for a salad plate. They are too large to fit on the butlers pantry plates. The raised edge is also too large to fit in my dishwasher plate rack, so they have to be hand washed. I am going to keep them because they are unique and I ended up using as serving pieces. They are very pretty, and I do love the collection. Unfortunately they are not made just a bit smaller so they can actually be used as an accent plate."
5,Beautiful drawings pack an illustrated history,"Bright, colorful pages packed with color illustrations and photos chart the art and history of the firecracker, from their construction and advancement to the making of labels and items promoting them. Beautiful drawings pack an illustrated history which invites leisure browsers as much as researchers, and which is very highly recommended for general library collections."
4,Art! and History?,"Excellent beautifully illustrated book well worth the money. The illustrations and layout are extremely well done. This is easy reading that covers some terrtory not well documented anywhere else (Vietnam.) Some historical inaccuracies especially in the history of the manufacture of ""Chinese"" crackers in the 20th century. Overall an excellent job! Highly reccomended to anyone who has an interest in the subject, or who just likes the imagery of the old labels."
5,great book,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He is a pyrotech and absolutely loves this book! It has a lot of great pics and info.
4,Good Read,"I was hoping for a book with details and photos of the crash. But, I wasn't disappointed. My heart goes out to this poor woman, who's life was torn apart by such a tragedy. It was obvious she loved her husband with every fiber in her body. It's a shame she didn't love his children like that. I marveled at someone who would let her adult daughter and grandson live with and mootch off her and her husband while at the same time farming out her husband's 5 year old daughter because they didn't have ""room"" for her, too, and then wonder, years later, why the girl resented her.Still, it was a very good book and should help anyone dealing with grief. I hope she can use what happened to her in the aftermath of this tragedy to help pave the road for victims of similar tragedies in the future. I hope she can go on with her life and turn a negative into a positive.My hat's off to her!"
2,Briefly gives the reader brief outlines,"This book is so simple anyone could understand it. But for a reader really wanting to understand the ancient philosophy behind Feng Shiu it leaves you sadly lacking, as does Karen Kingston's book Creating Sacred Space with Feng Shui. The most comprehensive reading on this subject actually can be found in Nancy SantoPietro's book Feng Shui: Harmony by Design. I recommend this last book mentioned to anyone, beginner or advanced alike. None of the others even come close to its understanding of the subject matter and explaining hows and whys in the correct application of this ancient art."
2,This book does not cover most important aspects,and I was disappointed after reading this. I wish it would have discussed more common problems that US residents face in their homes and apartments. Could have been written with more diagrams and illustrations.
1,Pity for ignorants,"I feel very sorry for Ms Hodge, but having a bit of knowledge about Lalique glass and being myself a good collector, I want other future unlucky buyers to know that the author, apart from having published the most horrible photographs of Lalique glass I have seen in the last 20 years, has absolutely no idea about R. Lalique's work. I really wonder how an editor can publish a book like this. No more comments. Too sad, after all.... Augusto Giardini"
4,Tommy introduces Frankie Ruiz and Carlos Alexis.,"Tommy Olivencia introduced Frankie Ruiz and Carlos Alexis on this 1982 release. Spearheaded by the ever-popular ""Primero Fui Yo"", this was one of Olivencia's best-selling 1980s releases. Other noteworthy tracks were ""La Suplicante"" and ""Fantasia De Un Carpintero""."
3,a pretty solid product,"The sword is good but one feature should be considered before purchasing. It is as follows:I suppose this adds to it's ""indestructibility"" but the sword is a little flexible. However, if your blade angle is in line with the angle of your cut, then there is no notice. You can only feel it when you hit something, or when you, e.g. twist your sword during a cut. I suppose that can be considered a positive thing, as it will give you feedback when you make a bad cut.I used it during a demonstration, and it was rather comfortable. The grip is (for lack of a better description that comes to mind) a the tiniest bit coarse, but it does nothing but improve grip.This is a good choice, if you don't mind the slight flexibility. I haven't tried it yet, but i would imagine, it would be good for sparring, too."
5,Bokken,"I love it. My friend and I decided to take up sparring, and so we both bought one of these bokkens. They're a good weight, sturdy, and so far they are indestructible. It's certainly worth the price, in my opinion. The only thing that concerns me about the sword is the tip is sharp enough to do some damage. I'd advise sanding it a bit before you start using it.Disclaimer: I bought this for fun. I know nothing of actual swordsmanship."
5,Strong!,"I bought this for my boyfriend so he could train, he loved it, previously I bought a wood bokken but it broke even before I got it. This is a far better choice."
4,Bokken,"Great and tough Cold Steel makes great products, but it is a little on the light side for a good work out."
5,Love it!!,"I actually use two at the same time to practice, yes I am that good!!!Love the weight, almost like using a real sword!! and durable too!!!Last boken you'll ever buy, trust me, it's indestructible!!"
2,Meh,"Don't buy this. after a good work out, the handle gets too slippery as opposed to a nice wooden bokken.also, upon impact, the vibration of this bokken is horrid."
4,Really nice bokken,"The bokken is a great piece to add to my collection. The bokken is pretty well crafted. The guard and rubber hold come in a separate bag, which goes on as a very tight fit that has yet to budge. It has a flexibility in the blade that contributes to its indestructibility. My only complaints are a slight warp in the blade and the grip on the handle doesn't provide much resistance, but leather gloves fix that. The sword is also very light in comparison to a real sword, or even a wooden bokken, weighing in at about .8 lbs. Overall, the blade has a nice feel, with a balance point just past 5"" down the blade."
4,Very good low profile subwoofer,"I bought this to round out my HTS and it is great. I wanted something that would fit inside a cabinet and be out of site, but I only had 8.5"" of height. This subwoofer fit in the space perfectly. It is long though, about 23"" long, so it took up almost the entire shelf. The bass is deep and rich, and really adds to television, movies and music. You won't rattle your neighbors windows, but you'll definitely be surprised at the ""lows"" the Lolita offers. It was a very good purchase and I would buy it again."
4,Nice gift,I got 2 of these Pendant for my daughters for mother's day and they just loved them. Very nice.
5,A lovely symbol.,"I bought this for my daughter, who, after great difficulty conceiving a child, through the miracles of modern reproductive science was finally able to give birth to her own beautiful daughter. This pendant is a beautiful symbol of the wonder that is my granddaughter."
1,Dissapointed,Item was not as it appeared...item was supposed to be all silver but mine had this white material on the mother's front. Very dissapointed! !!
1,Empty Box: No Stars and an upset customer. Purchased at Amazon,"Imagine, it's a friend's birthday party and you have an Amazon gift. She opens the box and it's empty, Some 50 guests are looking and the birthday girl is dismayed. I paid to have the gift wrapped. The gift box is EMPTY. Empty. I am mortified. I want this gift sent directly to my friend and in a gift box AT NO CHARGE to me. I am VERY UPSET."
4,It was an interesting ending,I liked this one. It kept me wanting to keep reading it and notput it down. The only thing was in parts it was kind ofpredictable. Other than that it was coolness. The ending was rather suprising.
2,Well..........,I have read ALOT of this series and i was very unimpressed with this one. You can tell that the author wrote it awhile ago by the language and it just seemed WAY to good to be true. I suggest number # in this series. (sharing sam)
5,Cheap alternative to buying sets.,"The Craftsman 5/16"" - 18 tap that I was using broke. I didn't bother going to Craftsman (their tool quality has really slid) and found this one here on Amazon for less then $4 and gave it a try.The quality of the tap far exceeded my expectations. I have used it in 6061 and 5052 aluminum and mild steel with amazing results. Very smooth chip clearing with light lubrication/cutting fluid.A great HSS tap at a really nice price.Pros:Inexpensive.Smooth and clean threads.Cons:Didn't come with a storage case or sleeve, not a huge deal though."
5,haunting and captivating,"Having just completed a raft trip on the deschutes river, this book was given to me by a friend. It captured me from the first page and held me through the last. My experience in growing up near a similar railroad siding and having friends who traveled and worked on the railroad then spending the last twenty years guiding on rivers was captured to even the little details. This book so mirrors my experience that I ended up reading it in a single sitting. Lesley's characters are real, the experience he describes is real and the tragedies experienced along the river are so real as to be nearly non-fictional. This is a must read, I have ordered every other book he has written!"
4,Worth your time,"A boy becoming a man while living in a small town with his widowed mother and bachelor uncle. While tragic events spawn heroic efforts to save lives and property, young Culver watches his uncle Jake seek redemption for events long past. In the end, how can one take away from this novel the idea that mistakes, especially grave mistakes, can leave lasting scars. Craig Lesley's descriptions are masterful. I felt the warmth and dryness of summer and the cold grayness of winter. Read this book."
4,"A very, very good read!","If you love the outdoors (like me) and you want to read a great coming of age tale, get this book. And for those of you who have spent time around Bend, Oregon, it's a must read!"
5,"the northwest, the river and storytelling.",a collection of short stories woven into a novel; you can hear the roar of the rapids and smell the fish frying while the characters tell us tales. Native american characters of depth side by side with the events in a small northwestern town. i wanted the book to go on and on
3,just alright,"Young Culver's dad died in a river accident. His step-dad is alright but doesn't earn enough to keep Mom happy. Mom and Culver leave him and go back to their hometown where Uncle Jack makes a living on the same river in which Dad drowned. Culver gets a father-figure, Mom gets a job, small-town life absorbs them. This story is well-narrated, great descriptive passages, but it didn't quite keep my attention. I found the ending to be very unsatisfying . . . left me wondering what it what all for"
5,Superb tale of young man growing up in Central Oregon.,"My wife, who read the book first, and I thoughly enjoyed a tale of a young man growing up in Central Oregon. The place names are substituted for real places and, no doubt, real people. If you fly fish the Deschutes River this is a 5-star book!"
2,Serious Disapointment,"I picked up The Sky Fisherman expecting a riveting murder mystery. The first few chapters introduced some interesting characters that presented lots of potential for the rest of the book. As the book progressed the potential for excitement increased. Five deaths occurred and they all seemed to be the result of foul play. As the police searched for answers the main character, Culver, and his uncle, Jake, attempt to carry on with their lives. Culver also continued to try to find out just how and why his father drowned on the Lost, a river near the town. All in all this book was filled with unfulfilled potential. I have often read books that I disliked but this book was more disappointing than any of them."
4,BUTCHIN',"Five song EP from Austrailian metal rock band, Grinspoon, offers a heavy metal sludge sampling, with everyman teen vocals that unexpetedly burst into raving mad adult monster, and guitar chords that could excavate a stone quarry. Grinspoon lays it nice and neat with no pretense; just good rockin' songs spewing hard knockin' angst, with just enough 'F' words to remind us this is a private teen club."
5,"Vibrant, heavy rock band!","Unfortunately, many, and I do mean 'many', Australian bands do not get the recognition that they should overseas as they do within Australia. Bands like The Cruel Sea, Regurgitator, Grinspoon and many others, have partially broken through the all-american favourites, but still don't get enough distribution that an honest, hard working band should get. Only now are they being noticed with bands such as Silverchair and Living End crashing into american charts. But this is only a very meagre start."
3,A heavy wall of sound type album,"I got to meet these guys in nyc recently, and they are quite nice. Their record is very heavy along the tool/helmet line of things. Good to put on when you can turn the volume to 8 and surround yourself with grinspoon's wall of sound."
1,"Made in China, NOT in Italy as advertised","Given the recent spate of pet deaths and child deaths due to tainted Chinese products, I'm trying to avoid items made in China, especially when it comes to things that might hold food. I bought four of these trays in the belief that they were manufactured in Italy. WRONG! MADE IN CHINA!Note to Amazon: adopt a policy of honestly reporting where ALL products are manufactured, so that consumers can make informed decisions about whether or not they wish to purchase them."
3,Fun - and historically significant!,"Yep, the Avalanches were a studio group that included notables Billy Strange, Tommy Tedesco, Hal Blaine, and David Gates - later of 70's icons Bread. All the songs are ""winter-themed,"" but several of them are also closely associated with Christmas."
5,The Beach,"As most leather balls, the water weighs it down, I don't recommend that. As far as durability, we used it about 40 hours a week, sand only for close to 7 months, by then, It was getting rough to play with, based on the hours logged on it, and the fact it was 2 on 2 beach, the wear and tear was expected. It's a good ball still, and like someone else said, put your name on the ball,once the game is over, your ball is gone too. You won't find a better volleyball than this, I had to wait 4 months to get one when I first ordered."
1,Out of Stock & no Communication,"Never sent item nor communicated that it was out of stock - had to contact them to find out - right before Christmas, and of course, this was a present - what a pain - couldn't you have bothered to email?????"
4,starter's sleeve,Excellent item to use a high school and summer track meets for youth. Make sure color is bright when used at night
5,Wonderful classroom addition,"A Walk in the Rain Forest is a wonderful introduction to the tropical rain forest- its plants, animals, and people. The book tells the story of XYZ- a small ant- and his journey through the rainforest. The beautiful pictures and simple text appeals to children of all ages. Additional factual information appeals to older children. This is a great book to use in the classroom to help introduce children to the wonders of the rain forest"
4,Nice book about Rainforest creatures,"This is a colorful look at different Rainforest creatures, written by a teenager. It follows a frog introducing animals you might meet in the Rainforest. It is not quite as good as her other book Under the Sea. I would recommend it for 4-8 year olds, it can be wordy."
3,Addicting cd...now my favorite singer!,"I hadn't gotten into Sister Soleil's music until I started listening to her newer cd, ""Dirty Little Secret"". I realized that the familiar older name Sister Soleil was the same person. I knew only one song from Soularium...""Torch"". After I bought the cd and listened to all of the songs, I got addicted. It's my favorite cd now, and I love all the songs on it, although some ARE pretty bizarre."
2,Over-produced remake of her self-released album!,"First off, I love Stella's vocal ability, and her live show is nothing short of amazing. Yet this album takes the best of her previous work and mangles it into new songs that seem over worked. The sound is not natural - something that really shines through in her live performances. If you can find a copy of her first album, get it, it captures the live essence of Stella much better than Soularium does."
2,"Tiny, but [Not So] Tough!","ORIGINAL ***** Review:I'm truly amazed at the versatility of the MultiMix8 FireWire! I heeded Mr. Talerico's advice and downloaded/installed the Mac OS.X (Leopard) upgrade before setting up the mixer. Everything ran perfectly, first time out of the chute!I'm getting re-acquainted with Cubase, starting with the bundled ""lite"" version: Cubase 4LE - a not-particularly-subtle attempt to get the user to upgrade to the more sophisticated - and vastly more expensive - Studio suite (which I'll probably purchase down the road. Yeah, they got me; I've always like the Cubase & VST platform, starting waaaay back in the Atari Falcon days).I've noticed that the MultiMix gets quite toasty, but nothing alarming. All-in-all, this is the best little tabletop mixer I've seen in a long while.. Highly recommended!UPDATE **: The ""toasty"" aspect of this mixer should have alerted me to its eventual demise! RIP March 10, 2010."
4,Wish they had set pages up differently for cut and pastes,"While these books are reproducible, they have them set up in a way that you have to reproduce some pages because of the cut and pastes are on both sides of some pages. Content is useful and the kids enjoy doing them. We homeschool and to save myself time, I purchased 4 of them so I could save on copy time. One would have been totally sufficient since I have to copy most of the book anyway."
2,Not that impressed.,"I was not that impressed. I'm using it to homeschool my son for 1st grade and it's just not creative and exciting for him. He (and I) has gotten bored very shortly after we began using it, and now it's a struggle to get him to do his science. The concepts are fairly simple, and I don't mind simple concepts at this age as long as you add in some ideas/crafts/games to make it fun and interesting. None of the subjects go in depth enough to hold his attention."
5,Easy to open and use,"Purell manufactures a wonderful product. Small and very easy to carry in pocket or purse. My main concern is however that the packing is not recyclable.Now with all of the Ecoli scares and now they are even finding Salmonella in dog and cat food. Be sure to wash your hands after handling your pets food, pets food dishes and be careful where you sit the food or dishes down. Sanitize, Sanitize, Sanitize."
4,better for environment than the plastic bottles,"I prefer the packs of sanitizer to the plastic bottles because the packaging uses much less plastic than plastic bottles. The inside of the paper packets is lined with plastic. Also, they are more convenient to store around the house or to take on a trip. They can be stored in a pretty box or somewhere out of the way where they are not noticeable in the house so they don't detract from the decor.There seems to be a high alcohol content, but they work fine on my skin and don't cause an allergic reaction. I have sensitive skin and have to use special soaps, so this product is probably suitable to most skin types. Also, I am very susceptible to catching a cold so I often wipe my lower face with these when I enter the house after being out in cold weather and this has dramatically reduced the number of colds I catch. For a few cents per use this product is a great deal, however about 1/25 of the wipes are dry and unusable which is why I took off a star."
1,Purell Sanitizing Hand Wipes....Awful!,"What a huge disappointment. I've used Purell before and their products have always seemed to be of very good quality. I have found the exception! The sanitizing hand wipes should ONLY be used as sandpaper! Maybe a solid desktop could handle it, but only if it needs to be refinished. Do not waste your money!"
5,can't live without them,"I got a bunch of these for myself and my family. I always keep a few packs in my purse when i go out to clean myself from germs or spills or even sweat. It really works and on a hot day it really comes in handy, you put it on your neck or arms and believe me it will cool you off and keep you cool for about 30 to 45 minutes. It also leaves you feeling clean and smell good."
3,Does the job but could be better,"I was not expecting the best wipes after reading other people's reviews but I figured that for the price I might as well give Purell a shot. The wipes do what they are advertised to do. They are full of moisture (slightly scented) but it's all gone after a few seconds so you gotta be quick cleaning your hands, otherwise, you end up with a rough dry paper. Good thing, it's not too thin that it'll tear, it's just too rough for me. I'm sure there are far better brands out there but these are fairly cheap and pretty decent. Oh, about the size, 5"" x 7"" is ok for my hands."
3,Expires,"I didn't know this thing had an expiration date on it. After a year in the closet, most of them dried out. Kinda embarrassing when you offer someone a dry piece of paper. Worked fine while it was still moist though."
1,Purell Sanitizing Hand Wipes,"These wipes a are smaller, harsher version of the original Purellhand wipes I used to buy. They have a very strong alchohol smell and don'tmoisturize the skin, although the product claims to do that. They remindme of the cheap wipes one receives from a mediocre restaurant orgas station! Not worth the money!"
2,The consistency of dry paper,"Many of the wipes i received are dry or almost dry after opening the packet. Additionally, the wipes have the consistency of paper -so much so that they must be 'unfolded'. The wipes are in no way soft or absorbent. I find these unpleasant to use."
4,Works OK,"The base paper is not as comfortable as Sani-hands. Liquid cleaner drips off of the sheet, as it is thinner than the cleaner on Sani-hands."
1,"very poor ""upgrade"" of what was a good product","The ""brand new"" Purell hand wipes are a terrible new version of what were great hand wipes previously made by Purell and Cojo. The previous wipes (with alcohol) were larger 6 X 8"" soft waffle cloth that worked well for any cleanup or sanitizing. The old version no longer made or available were clothlike and could clean while sanitizing. The new version are smaller hard paper similar to wax paper with liquid dripping from the hard paper. It is useless in cleaning and very rough on any surface. It has NO absorbing properties. I would never buy again."
1,dumping,"The product itself purell sanitizing hand wipes is an excellent product.Because this product, which used to be readily available at many locations is now hard to find, I bought six boxes of 100. This order was placed in November.When they arrived I discovered All the boxes had an expiration date of December, which means they were very old.This had not been mentioned when I ordered. Many of the wipes were dry and therefore useless.The shipping price was also far more than the price of the product. I was unhappy with the failure to mention the expiration date which makes me hesitant to purchase other fungible items online."
5,"Terrific, Handy Hand Cleansers","I ordered these Purell Hand Sanitizer Towelettes after the airlines had banned certain items due to safetly concerns. As it turned out, these foil wrapped towelettes really came in handy, not only on the airplane, but all during my trip. Easy to carry and use, I didn't have to use public restrooms for handwashing as one never knows what might be lingering on those faucet handles or door handles and I also used them before meals when dining out. I highly recommend carrying a few of these as they easily fit into jeans pockets, purse, and jacket pockets. They are not drying and left my hands feeling clean and refreshed as well as moisturized."
1,Don't bother buying this!!!,"As someone who buys lots of items online, especially from Amazon, I was very displeased at the fact that this itemwas only one sale probably for the fufiller of the order to empty out his stores of hand sanitizing wipes. The expiration on these 2 boxes of wipes was last December 2011. Plus, the shipping and handling was $9.98 on an item that didn't even weigh that much. I could see maybe $4.98, but almost 10, no way am I ever buying anything from them again."
2,Purell sanitizing hand wipes,"The product is adequate, but extremly strong. It will burn sensitive skin areas.I complained to the vendor that the box sent to me had an experiation date only two months after my receipt of the product. The vendor's response was wholly unacceptable. I think Amazon must due a much better job of policing it's on=line vendors. This the second purchase in a row where I have had an unacceptable experience with a vendor."
2,Not really what I wanted.,"Not very good as a hand wipe, doesn't feel like a wipe feels more like a wax paper smothered in hand sanitizer. Would not buy again."
2,All dried up!!!,This order of Purell Sanitizing Hand Wipes seemed like a great value at first. However many of the individual packets were all dried up when opened for use.We were very disappointed as we use individual wipes all the time when out. The convenience of being able to carry the little packet all the time in my pursejust cant be discounted.
1,avoid this product,"Upon arrival, roughly half of these hand wipes were completely dried out. About as useful as wiping your hand with printer paper."
2,Steve Jackson I need a bestiary!!!,"When I bought this book,I was convicted that all my problems withmonsters are over...I was wrong. Fantasy Bestiary is a compendium of uncharismatic monsters of unnusual cultures.The good ones like beholders and goblins aren`t present on this book.One more time the Gurps team don`t look for tradicional fantasy RPG style and the players need to do adaptations for a good session"
5,love this small,"small book filled with HUGE teachings!i only read several sections at a time, practical, simple, encouraging and yet serves as a beautiful examination of conscience."
3,thoroughly enjoyable with great detailed pictures,"The information is general in nature, with some history but I loved seeing how different buttons enhanced the same fabrics. The detail is very sharp with vivid color."
1,book of buttons joyce whitmore,I originally read this book at my Library. Liked it so much I sent for it from Amazon. HOWEVER this copy has NO COLORED PICTURES. Are you kidding me???? A button collector is interested in COLOR as well as other things. I am beginning to think these publications are CHEAP copies of the books we think we are recieving. No more ordering from Amazon for me!!!
1,Considering I didn't get what I ordered....,"I received this product after a long wait and lo and behold, it wasn't what I ordered. Careful folks."
3,More Difficult Than It Appears,"Gustav Mole's world has been infested with noise and now his children refuse to play music. In order to inspire them to play Gustav takes his family on a trip around the world, visiting many different cultures and listening to their music. In this way the reader is carried on a journey that introduces them to many different forms of music and types of musical instruments. While this is an amusing story and a great overview of some not-very-well-known musical instruments, this is definitely not a book for preschoolers. With vocabulary including words such as; foundry, urban sprawl, transmitter, lament, to name a few, this book would be inappropriate for the youngest children. I would recommend it for older children, but be prepared to do a lot of explaining about instruments carrying names like Saron Panerus and animals like macaques."
2,I was disappointed.,I expected a scenario of a war with middle east terrorist. But ended up with an unlilely invasion of Mexico with no resistance.
1,Fascinatingly awful writing,"The astonishingly clumsy writing of this book matches the transparency of its agenda (Awful Things Will Happen If We Cut Defense Spending) so perfectly that I had to read it in one sitting--the same kind of impulse that makes people slow down to look at a car wreck on the highway.I don't have time to go into details, but let me assure you that you'll find more hackneyed phrases (and more repitition of same) in this tome than you will in the average Harlequin Romance. Ships, after being hit by missiles or torpedoes, repeatedly ""slip beneath the waves to lie upon the floor of the sea"" (or something very similar). Navy pilots, we are expected to believe, think of their carrier-based fighters as ""iron chariots.""There's more, much more, in fact too much to list here. Read it for yourself for a good afternoon's amusement."
5,Casper is a thinking man!,"Do you think that we could win a war in the event one ever broke out? Are our current manpower levels enough to thwart off attacks from third world dictators? Can we suppress outbreaks of violence in the world?In this 450 plus page book, which may house hypothetical situations, you'll read what could happen. You find yourself asking questions about our military leadership and you will even start to look at the world in a different light.Weinberger's knowledge of military tactics, strategy and defense planning our unmatched and unparalleled. He was Secretary of Defense for over seven years. His knowledge of world politics is with a doubt superb.Most impressive is the ability to show the complexity of the situations and show how the United States armed forces are matched against the world. Weinberger's works is nothing short of a miraculous - excellent reading!"
4,Out Spoken is worth the cost of this album.,"Overall the CD is kind of weak. However ""Out Spoken"" is probably one of the sickest tracks I've ever heard, which is why I gave it 4 stars, without it, it's probably only a 2 or 3. So if you can download the song then don't worry about paying for the whole album. If not then get it without spending more then a normal price for a CD."
1,Liars!!!,"DON'T BELIEVE in the 2, 3, 4 or 5 stars reviews! This gamepad is one of the worst ever! Even Atari's could be better.Why? Why would you buy a gamepad that has a D-pad that DOESN'T work and ONLY 4 buttons?DO NOT BUY IT! AND I MEAN IT!"
1,Great as a practical joke for the gamer in your life.,"Let me add my voice to the chorus. This controller is the worst I have ever used. Period. I bought it in a thrift store and I still think I was robbed. The only use I could see for this is to drive the gamer in your life into a controller throwing rage as they attempt to use the ""directional pad"". Thought you pressed left? HAH! No, that was UP!"
1,only good for NBA Jam,"seriously.....this controller can only be used with NBA Jam, that's about it....maybe Big Rigs Over the Road Racing....turrible turrible piece of gaming equipment. AVOID LIKE A PLAGUE!!!!.....I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER"
2,Doh! - Not enough buttons !!,"This is potentially an excellent pad, but Microsoft have shot themselves in the foot here, because there are only 4 buttons. Why on earth they on put four buttons on such an otherwise excellent product is beyond me. The USB installation is a breeze and the D-pad is much better than the one on the Pro pad or even the original Sidewinder pad. Of course the price is unbeatable too. So - why, why, WHY did they only put 4 buttons?! I can't think of any modern games that need less than 6 at the absolute minimum. Such a shame ..."
2,not a very useful joypad,"I bought this thing to play NES emulator games. One major problem with it is there is no clear orientation of the directional pad. That is, which way is true up? which way is true down? Playing Kid Icarus for example, where pushing down makes you drop down through the platform you're standing on, you are constantly accidentally dropping through the floor.quite frustrating. this thing sucks."
1,Microsoft just got worse....,"I hate the stupid piece of junk.... when I play Tetris, I try and hit left, and the piece shoots down, on Fighting games, I CAN'T JUMP! And when I do, it always jumps forward... I like my Gravis better, by far"
2,From Good To Bad,"I bought this controller with high hopes it would solve some of my PC gaming problems. I was looking for an inexpensive, reliable gaming device to use with my racing games. I know I probably would have been better off buying a racing wheel setup in the first place, and now it looks as if I am going to have to. When I first plugged it in, it worked great. I'm used to this type of controller with racing games, so that didn't bother me. However, it did not want to run with my new NASCAR Racing 4 game, no matter what I tried. I couldn't get it to to work with Tomb Raider either, but I figured it wasn't the best controller out there for [theprice]. I was satisfied with it until the day it quit working. I don't know if I dropped it, or if it has a self-destruct mechanism that goes off after 6 months of being used. My PC won't detect it, and I know my USB ports are working. All in all, this is a good controller when it is working. The controls are smooth, and the set up is real easy, ... ."
1,"sooo sad, such a hi-tech looking controller...","Okay, it looks pretty.. and the bottons are all glossy.. and it's really really easy to install (just plug it in). but, UMMM.. the buttons get stuck! Mario ran off the cliff about 5 times without me even doing anything! and the running button wouldn't get unstuck when i pressed other buttons, so all i could do is watch Mario commit suicide, which made me very upset. Also, the directional pad is extremely difficult to use, and for some reason, the down button keeps getting pressed when i try to go forward. In other words, i'm returning this controller tomorrow morning. =)"
4,"A Dragon, A Dragon","The movie called Petts Dragon has a song I think of as I played this game. It starts off, ""A dragon... a dragon... I swear I saw a dragon!"" It's a fun game that can be use for educational purposes. For example, one could ues the object of buying and selling armor to teach a child about doing the same in a grocery or clothing store."
3,SlOW BUT EDICTIVE,"I have been playing this game lately. The dragging out of the battles with their descriptions of all the details can be quite annoying. It takes like forever to gain a level, but still you don't seem to be able to stop playing the game. If you have a lot of time to kill, by all means, play the game. However, I never finished the game and defeated the dragonlord. To tell the truth I'm afraid of fighting this end boss. I have heard that he is quite hard to defeat, and that you need all your MP just to stay alive. But to me it's worth playing up to this point, and I get a feeling of satisfaction when I just acquire the best equipment in the game, which is hard enough to do. All in all it is a pretty good game and a classic RPG. So I guess one should not be to critical about all it's flaws."
3,Boooooo,"I had this and Final Fantasy, and I think Final Fantasy trashed it.Most older games required a lot of ""grinding"" to gain levels and money to be able to purchase itemsto get stronger so you could face your next foes, I found this was terrible in dragon warrior.Most people if they played this now wouldn't get very far, between the graphics and gameplay its aweful.Unless your a Dragon Warrior enthusiast, stay away."
5,One Console RPG To Rule Them All,"Sure, the graphics are outdated, the music quality isn't so great, but then again.. it is a NES game, not to mention, this game was the first console RPG -EVER-, and that demands some respect. What followed after this? The Original Final Fantasy, the sequals, leading up to Chrono Trigger, Star Ocean 2, Baten Kaitos, so on, so forth. This is the original console RPG.Despite the graphics and sound, this is a fun game. You walk around and level build, and as you get stronger you can venture further out into the world. Simplistic concept, sure.. but this is a fun game indeed."
5,My Family season 1&2,Outrageously funny and entertaining show that keeps you engaged in the antics of the English Harper family. True English humor with a touch of sinister sarcasm plus all the wittiness you would expect. Have been waiting for BBC to release other seasons to dvd in region 1 but still none yet.
5,Like a great big piece o' apple pie...,"With US music trends dipping precariously towards ""Pop/Trash/Britney"" stylings, where the artist doesn't even play an instrument, let alone write the songs and co-produce, it's great to hear some good 'ol ""Americana"". And the emphasis is on ""Good"", here. Restoration's 14 tracks are all finely crafted, intricate, but never overdone works of a group of people who obviously know what they're doing. They have gorgeous violin, jangling mandolin, and Andy Dee's incredible lap-steel. What more could you want?"
4,Typical excellent Tamiya quality,"This will be my third Tamiya battleship (already completed the Tirpitz and Yamato) and I'm really looking forward to this one. Sifted through the pieces and is exactly what I've come to expect from Tamiya. The only reason they only get four stars is because they don't come with any photo-etched parts. Throwing in some White Enseign Models or Gold Medal Models PE definitely makes this a 5+. This kit is getting harder and harder to find, so grab it while you can!"
5,Awesome!!,These are the best! Heavy -not that flimcy stuff you find at the retails. Everyone should have a set.
4,Gift to self for Christmas,My daughter recommended these utencils and since I have many pans I decided to try the baking set. Of those I've used I find them great ...
5,Very Heavy Duty,Nice and solid. Especially like the square bake pan. The non-stick surfaces are very durable. Still going after 8 years.
5,Wonderful!!,"No problems with this set. Haven't had much sticking. Nice quality, heavy. It had a knick or two on the outside but nothing serious.I'm getting my mother one for Mother's Day!!"
5,Very good bakeware - Simply Calphalon,The order arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.This is very high quality bakeware and we are very pleased. It also stacks nicely for compact storage.I have made my best cookies and also love the cooling rack. My kids were in awe that we could make a layer cake.This is a good investment - heirloom quality.
4,NIce bakeware,"High quality, great for cakes and muffins. The cookie sheet doesn't work so well for pizza, but then. that's not what it's made for.eay cleanup too."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Like other reviewers, mine also began to rust under the curled edge soon after purchasing it. (And, no, I did not broil with my cake pan--who would??--or use any harsh detergents.) I agree that mainly it is just gross taking a rust-dripping pan out of the dishwasher. You can never get all of the rusty water out from under that lip, no matter how hard you try. After nearly a year of use, the top surfaces are scratched, but maybe in a bit better condition than cheapies I've picked up at Walmart in a pinch. However, they are not what I would have expected from Calphalon."
1,Flaking and rusting,"Received a set of bakeware as a gift. At first, I was impressed with the weight/look of the pans and the Calaphon name. After a few uses, the non-stick coating is flaking off and the pan is rusting where there is no coating. I have never used sharp utensils on these pans and I wash them by hand. Buy something else. I'm throwing these out."
5,Bakeware as Great as the Cookware,I am slowly changing all my cookware to Calphalon and am now starting on the bakeware.I found this starter set to be a great buy and I really like the way the cakes and cookies I have made so far have turned out.I am really sold on Calphalon!!!
3,"Sort of, but not really a good deal.","The pans and baking sheet are heavy and non-stick as advertised. However, a few uses of the loaf pan and the coating chipped off, revealing the raw metal material. Since one had to be thrown out, the others are still usable. They are good for the price."
3,"IS THE SALE PRICE REALLY A ""SALE""?","I purchased them one month ago and at first was very happy. I felt I had saved a great deal of money. I've only used 3 of the 6 pieces - the loaf pan, the cooling rack, and the cookie sheet. Both the loaf pan and cookie sheet have begun to chip in the bottom. Also, when the heat is above 400, the cookie sheet warpes and bends, almost twisting. Once its cool it mostly reverts back to its original shape. I give this item 3 stars because it is a good deal, even for $23. I had shopped around before buying and one loaf pan would have costed at least $15. They work well if you cook in lower heat and don't use them that often. They will really be worth your money. If you're looking for something of higher quality and durability, keep looking."
2,Cheaply made,"Consistant with the other comments, this item EASILY rusts. One trip in the dishwasher or sink and you've got rust water pouring from the curled up edges. Not exagerating at all.Also, the non-stick surface is ""nice"" but does not last. Not to mention I figured out the hard way non-stick bakeware doesn't work as well."
1,Terrible purchase,"this product is terrible! i made cookies on it the first time i used it. at the same time i used a glass pan and put cookies in each. this pan not only burned my cookies, while the glass pan cooked them perfectly through, but i can see on the pan where the cookies were even after the pan was washed. Also, this product claims to be dishwasher safe, however, when i pulled it out of the dishwasher the first time, it had already started to rust and dripped rusty water every where."
2,Be very careful..,"This product was not the quality I expected. It looks heavy duty, but the finish is very cheap and does not last long at all."
1,Cheap Non-stick Baking Items Not For The Long Haul,"I bought this baking set about six months ago. I have already thrown away the baking sheet and cake pans. The non-stick finish does not last--and I do know how to take care of pans with a non-stick finish. They also were not really non-stick! They are light weight and cheap. This is a problem with other, newer Calphalon pieces I have purchased over the past two years. I wish I returned this item early on. It was not worth the cheap price I paid."
2,Calphalon Bakeware Set Review,I have several pieces of calphalon nonstick bakeware bought individually and they are much better quality than the 6-piece set I recently purchased. This set is really not up to Calphalon's standards and I would not purchase this set again.
2,Cheap pans - not even embossed with logo,"I was very disappointed when the bakeware arrived. They are a much cheaper grade than the other Calphalon line, and do not even have their logo anywhere on the pans. I thought for sure they were cheap taiwan pans in a calphalon box. IF it weren't for the Amazon sale these would be returned immediately. This is the first time I've not bought the commercial grade calphalons and it will be the last time. You get what you pay for.."
3,"Nice set, but not made in the USA!","The product specifications on Amazon clearly state that this bakeware is manufactured in the USA. However, I bought this set as a gift and upon receiving and inspecting it I see that it clearly says made in China. I am sure it is still a nice set, but I would like to have accurate information before I buy. I like shopping at Amazon and this is the first time this has happened. It may be that Calphalan gave Amazon, possibly by mistake, the wrong information, so this could have been accidental, but the information on Amazon should be corrected. Thank you."
2,"Made in CHINA, no logo Calphalon......Sad!","One of the reviewer, Vagabond, was wrong! The box said they were made in CHINA, not TAIWAN. I do wish they were made in Taiwan, which will have higher quality than those made in CHINA. One thing Vagabond right about is that those bakewares have no logo! Very sad! Calphalon is stepping into the field of Made in China......"
3,it chips really easily....,"I absolutely love this pattern..... I have purchased all of the pieces for a serving of 12+. BUT.... it chips so easily, and I even wash it by hand. I use it for my everyday set, so it is used a lot- but still. I would expect it to be more durable."
5,A whole new perspective of Bach,"This is by far the most relaxing version of Bach's WTC. Bach is something that no matter how you play these pieces, his greatness will always shine through. Mr. Barenboim pours a lot of emotion into his playing, and it may just move you deeply if you open your heart and ears listening."
2,Domage.,"The sound quality is murky and Mr. Barenboim's playing murkier. I frankly don't understand, for example, how his temporary slow-down in the F-sharp minor fugue is anything but random, ridiculous, wrong. Certainly, some individual pieces impress, but on the whole, methinks Mr. Barenboim was off his game a bit here."
3,"quite good, but it could be better...","Barenboim add strongs harmonic accents, deep classical feelings, but there are two basical things that he missed:1. It is not a perfect performance. I'm used to listen pianists like Alfred Brendel or Murray Perahia. When you reach this level, you don't want a less perfect performance of anything.2. The digital reverb SUCKS. Sorry... but THAT kind of pianos deserve a natural enviroment to let the harmonics flow naturally. Of course, this digital cheap reverb was used to hide mr Barenboim's mistakes when playing, he also used the pedal to do the same thing.Anyway, it's a pity. I guess this work fits better in the hands of guys like Kovacevich, Kempff..."
2,stay away,"Though I have not heard this CD I have heard Mr. Baremboim playing WTC I live in the Konzerthaus in Vienna- the first concert where I went away during the break, and as a friend told I have not been the only one...Sometimes you have to decide:being an opera director,being a conductor,being a pianist.....Buy instead: Fellner, Gould, Fischer, Gulda,..."
2,Time in one small package,Ok maybe it was in the fine print or something but this alarm clock is TINY! I didn't realize it would be so small. It can pretty much fit in te palm of my hand.
2,Cute... but does not keep time well.,"I have two of these. They are so cute... very small... adjustable color display... easy to set. The only thing I don't like is that they both keep terrible time. They run very fast. Both of the two I bought gain almost ten minutes every six weeks, so I am constantly setting their time BACK for accuracy."
1,Runs Fast,My clock is not accurate. It runs fast. That's a fatal flaw for me. A clock that plugs into the house current should rarely need resetting.
3,"Nice, but a bit small in size","Bought this clock for my mother's bedside so she could see the time at night. Having the various colors is a great idea for a senior citizen, but the face of the clock is prett small. Though bright, I would have preferred a model w/ a larger display, otherwise it seems like a fine unit. It's not a travel clock, as it needs an electric outlet."
1,Runs really fast,"The clock has a lot of features that I love, it's a good size, lights up nicely, has a decent alarm and is easy to work, but it doesn't do the one job it's supposed to. I've only had the clock a week and it's already running about 4 minutes too fast. The clock isn't very useful to me if it can't keep time."
2,"Not easy to use, or turn off","Pros: Small sizeCons: Hard to remember how to set it or use it. Plus, it's impossible to turn it off without lifting up the top flap, which is hard to do when it's dark and you're sleepy. Also, it's hard to see the numbers during the day from various angles.Over all: I would not buy this item again. The main problem for me is that it's not easy to use."
1,"Great at first, broke after 3 weeks.","This alarm clock was great while it lasted. It is very small, which is perfect, pretty loud, and has a great little design. I also really liked changing the colors when I got bored. Unfortunately, I went to set the alarm tonight and every switch now only allows me to set the date, which obviously does not work for an alarm. I tried and unplugging and re-plugging several times, but it still will only let me set the date on every setting/switch. I suppose I shouldn't have expected much from a $10 alarm clock :("
1,Piece of Junk,"The mode is selected with a slider bar on the top (time set, alarm set, calendar set, etc). After about three weeks the only mode that would activate was ""calendar set"" no matter where the slider was placed. So, now I can't set the alarm to a new time. So, when you buy a low cost alarm, made in China, this is what you get - poor quality. My other minor complaint is that the display is really too bright for a dark room. The one plus is the battery backup which keeps the time so you don't have to reset the clock after a power outage."
2,Deceiving.,"The product itself works great, however the description is very deceiving because it is not the size the description suggests."
2,Clock,This clock has many nice features but it gains four seconds of time daily. I don't use it because of that issue.
2,the item was listed in not correct category,"The clock itself is not bad - standard small electric clock, but I wanted to buy ""traveler"" clock and I selected the Electric Alarm Clock in the list of the ""traveler"" items.In fact this is standard ""desktop"" clock, and it is not easy to use it in a trip"
3,Good and bad,"I do like it. It's totally portable, seems to be able to work on battery or through wire, and if you unplug it and plug it back in quickly enough, the information will still be saved. I like the lighting, and I like the fact that you can change the color. What I don't like is...even though I'm kind of a light sleeper, I am also paranoid about missing classes, so I like my alarms obnoxiously loud. This is not very loud at all. I really don't know if I'd recommend it for a heavy sleeper. I also don't like that you don't have any choice about the alarm length, the type of sound, or the volume. It's a cute, fun alarm clock, but it probably isn't your best bet if you're a heavy sleeper."
5,Super Value,"I bought one of these clocks. After it arrived, I bought 3 more. For something around a dozen dollars ... what a deal. They are easy to set without confusing double-function buttons. In my business, I need the ""seconds"" function. Also, having the day, date and 24-hour display makes for an almost perfect addition to my studio. If they made the same clock with Atomic Clock timing for self-setting and perfect accuracy, then they have a real winner. The accuracy of these seems to be about 3 to 5 seconds a week fast. That's okay for me, but I do have to reset to WWV every weekend for my logging purposes. The color selection is great. My studio logging clock is not for casual use. I need it constantly to record station events. Depending on ambient light, I just change the digit color -- it sure is much easier on the eyes to be able to view this thing for hours on end."
1,"Tiny, difficult to read and falls off night stand","I didn't realize how small this clock is when I ordered it. I actually have great vision but if it is placed anywhere but right next to my bed it is difficult to see the numbers. Not because the numbers are too small, but because the hard plastic casing it's in distorts the numbers. The numbers are decent sized but the whole clock is so small they had to curve the plastic and the shell of the clock so the numbers get fuzzy looking.It also is too light weight. It it feather light and so gets knocked around just touching the cord.The good featue about it is that you can change the color of the background and the numbers. But even given that nice feature, I'm going to have to buy another one because I don't want to be limited to keeping a digital clock on my night stand and strain to figure out the time."
3,Cute but unreadable display! I do not recommend this clock!,The clock display is cute with all the colors etc but the display has a concave lens which make the SMALL display harder to read from far or even close by if you are looking from an angle. I surely returned it.Maybe good for travel as it is quite compact.
4,"Good clock, color light (s) may die","i bought this as back up for when the power went out at our house at night. it works for that and there are many colors to choose from for the display. I've now owned it for about 14 months. Earlier, when i went to fix the time and date after the battery died during a power outage a few weeks ago, i found that the blue color didn't work. so now i can't have a blue, pink, purple or aqua color display. The ironic part is that those were the 4 i always used! :( So now i'm stuck with green, yellow (extremely ugly if you ask me) and red. ick. but it is otherwise a great alarm clock. just make sure you change the battery after every power outage or it probably won't last through the next one.P.S.; You have to reset the time, date and year every time the battery in the clock dies during a power outage."
3,SNOOZE ALERT,"I love that this little alarm clock can change colors to your preference. Only thing is; if you hit snooze more than 2 times BEWARE!!!! It does not go off AGAIN....Learned my lesson quickly after this had me waking up to my employer calling me concerned if I was ok @ 45 minutes past when I was to be @ work..... I know, I know, I should not hit snooze, but sometimes, it happens.... If you are a easy riser & can get out of bed with 2 snoozes then this is the alarm for you!"
5,Great little clock,"This is the best little clock - my research on Amazon panned out! I was looking for a clock for an entertainment center in a brightly-lit room - all the dim little clocks on the electronics can't be seen. This one, however, set on ""green,"" is PERFECT!"
1,Broke within 1 month,"Got this for my daughter, it broke within a month. Display shows 88:88 and none of the buttons will work after multiple attempts of unplugging etc."
4,Buen Reloj,"ComprÃ© este despertador con la esperanza de que fuera pequeÃ±o pero funcional y superÃ³ mis espectativas, pero lo Ãºnico malo es que los colores se ven mucho de noche y molesta la claridad. OptÃ© por poner el color rojo ya que es el que menos molesta. Debes tener en cuenta esto, pues en la noche se nota bastante. Por lo demÃ¡s esta muy bien, buen sonido, el tamaÃ±o de la pantalla."
2,Elgin Electric Alarm Clock with Selectable Display Color,"I want to return it ,because this order doesn't work anymore. I want to make a new order later.my bank was closed . how can I take money back?"
5,So far so good.,Bought this for the size and brightness. Put this on our verizon fios cable box in our bedroom. The new boxes dont have the time on the front that we used to use to look at the time.This does great for the bedroom and can see this from 8 ft away
4,Just What I Wanted,The small size is great.The lighting options are many and most could be used as nightlight. They are bright. Red worked for me. Would recomend to anyone.
3,Electric alarm clock,"Smaller than I thought and a little pricey since I paid three dollars more after the price went down a week later to $10.00.It was hard to see about 12 feet away because the illuminated time is small. Since it is on my desk bureau, I can't see the time when I'm lying on my bed. I have to get up to see the time."
2,Barely audible,"I loved the fact that you could change the display colors. That is a very cool feature. The alarm clock went off when it was supposed to, but I could barely hear the alarm even when I was awake. This might be ok for light sleepers, but being a heavy sleeper, I need something that will bring me out of even the deepest of sleeps."
4,"NICE CLOCK, TOO SMALL","I BOUGHT THIS CLOCK FOR MY MOM, FOR THE MONTH DAY DATE FETCHER AND THE BLUE COLOR. THAT SHE CAN SEE BETTER THEN ANY OTHER. THE SIZE STATED OF 5 X 5X 4 WOULD HAVE MADE IT PERFECT FOR HER. BUT THE SIZE WAS NOT TO BE, IT IS 3.61 IN. WIDE 3.42 IN. DEEP AND 2.08 IN.TALL. THE .6 INCH DIGET WAS CORRECT. AND FOR THE SIZE OF THE DAY YOU NEED TO BE RIGHT IN FROUNT OF IT TO EVEN KNOW IT IS ON THE DISPLAY. THE CLOCK IS VERRY EASY TO OPPERATE THE DIRECTION PAGE DID NOT EVEN NEED TO BE THERE. I HAD IT SET UP IN 1 MIN. THE SEEING AND MEMORY IMPAIRED SENIORS NEED THE FEACHERS OF THIS CLOCK, AT THE SIZE AND PRICE STATED.SOMEONE SHURE CAN'T READ A RULER. IF IT WAS A LITTLE BIGGER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR EVERYONE. TIMEX /ELGIN SHURE DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE."
3,"Easy to Set, Hard to Read","I just needed to be able to see the time in one room of my house that has no other clocks. I didn't need any special features, so I bought this inexpensive alarm clock. It was very easy to setup. There wasn't any guesswork; just slide the appropriate switches to the setting you want and press the associated button.The problem is, it is sometimes hard to read, especially if there is a light source nearby. It causes a glare on the lens, making it unreadble. I actually spent more time finding a place to put it where glare would not be a factor than I did setting it up.The multiple background colors do nothing for me and there seems to be not enough contrast against the backligting. The numbers are distinguishable against the backlit color, but because the numbers are blue on a blue background (for example), they aren't distinguisable enough.If price is a factor, go with this one. Otherwise check out some other products."
1,"Dimensions are incorrect in product description, very bright","The clock is 3 1/4 x 3 1/2 x 2 inches, not the size listed in the description. The display is very bright. Good if you want a clock that is also a night light, bad if you like a dark room to sleep in. If you turn off the multi-colored back light, you can not see the display at all. The controls are easy to figure out. The buttons are under a cover. With the cover closed, when you push the top, only the snooze button gets pushed, since it is right up against the cover. A good idea so you don't accidentally press something else while fumbling for the snooze button."
2,NOT FOR SNOOZERS,"Things I wish I had known about this product before purchase:- VERY BRIGHT!! It is so bright that I have to cover it at night! Would be great in a baby's room as a night light/clock- NOT FOR SNOOZERS!! The alarm will allow you to snooze 2 times and then it is just re-set for the next day. I have to be extra cautious and get up right away so I don't keep sleeping!!If these two things don't affect you, then it's an otherwise nice little clock. It's super small, the numbers can change to several different colors. I experimented and purple seems the least bright. Not bad for the price!"
1,Time runs fast. Need readjust every week.,I bought this clock last year. Initially i loved it. You can change the displace background color and the numbers are large and easy to read. Im giving it a one star because the time is always wrong. What good is a clock if the time is never accurate? I check the time on this alarm clock against my phone and computer every week. The alarms clock is always 4 to 5 mins faster.
2,Easy to use but just fine,I have a problem waking up in the morning and so I use a couple of alarms.This alarm allows one to have different colors for display which is good but I wonder how useful it is.Pro:The alarm is smallIts sturdyCon:The plastic makes it look cheap but that is not a reason to complain either.The volume level is fixed : not as loud as I thought.Somewhere not worth the price. But guess thats what $11 can give.
5,Perfect alarm clock!,"This is a tiny alarm clock that fits perfectly by my night stand. It fits in the palm of my hand! The clock allows you to pick different display colors: blue, red, green, which are super bright. However, I pressed all of the colors at once, which gave me this black/gray color which is perfect! The clock also allows you to pick AM/PM time display or military time (19:00 etc)... The size is what I sold me on this clock because I do not like clutter on my night stand! Thanks!"
3,Too small,The pictures are deceptive and the product is much smaller than it appears. Otherwise the product works as described in the description.
3,Decent Alarm Clock,"I found this alarm clock to be nice and compact, which was a great plus to save space on my night stand. The functions were incredibly easy to figure out, and the color changing face was a nice plus. I thought the alarm was plenty loud enough to wake me up, but I was very disappointed in the snooze function. I am one who likes the luxury of being able to hit the snooze button for at least a half hour before I actually have to get up. Unfortunately this snooze function only allows three 5 minute snoozes before the alarm stops. If you are like me, I am worried at how easy it may be to it for me to hit the snooze those three times and then never wake up because the an alarm never sounds again. All in all, it is a good alarm clock for the price, and if the minimal snooze length isn't an issue for you, I would recommend this product."
1,lasted 2 weeks,I got my son this clock for christmas and each color broke one right after the other. In total it lasted 2 weeks. FAIL.
4,Ouch alarm sound is horrible clock is nice!,I like this clock but not the alarm itself. I kept it for the time and other features. I like the variety of colors the writing can change to. Its a standard clock that works well. If you are like me and need a nicer sound alarm then dont use this as an alarm have a backup.
4,"Works well, but without colored backlight can't see numbers","As the title says, it works well. It came on time and as described in an original box.Pros: Bright light, on time clock, long cord, adequately loud alarm, battery powered so will keep time even if power goes offCons: Won't work without battery, the button is a little weird, basically you have to slide it over to turn the alarm on/off or set the time or alarm. You can't turn the alarm off till you open the top, it has a weird viewing angle, don't put it above your face cuz you won't be able to read it. If you turn off the colors there's no clock, its just black. The colors are pretty bright so I can't have the clock pointing toward me at night"
5,Attractive and Affordable!,"The alarm clock allows multiple color displays, includes seconds in its time and is very easy to use. I couldn't be happier with it!"
3,Cute Clock,"The clock is rather small, but it's cute. I don't use it as an alarm, but in my living room so I can easily see the time from my favorite chair. I especially like that I can change the color of the display. I've never seen anything like that before."
1,What time is it...?,"Well, this clock arrived and I was excited as I really needed a new clock and liked the idea of being able to change the color of the LCD! Surprise, the clock's LCD didn't light up at all, which means you can't tell the time---kind of a deal-breaker when you buy a digital clock! This was the second clock I ordered in less than a month that arrived defective, so this was pretty annoying."
3,My Review,"Over all it is a pretty nice alarm clock. The Display is hard to read at an angle. The display becomes too hard to read when I lay in my bed. The alarm wakes me up and I like how it displays the Date and current day of the week as well. It also displays the seconds which makes time feel a a little more animated rather than staring at a clock that only changes each minute. It's pretty cool that it can change the display light into 6 possible color, but I got this alarm clock because I was interested in the color blue displayed in the picture. It is a pretty small alarm clock. I was pretty surprised when I got it."
4,A boy who came home by Elsa Ericson,"This book was published in 1947 and I was pleasantly surprised at its condition when it arrived. I would definitely buy from this seller again. I believe the shipper was ""toomuctstuff4us."""
4,A beginner's guide to love of country.,"What I love about this book is that it puts a younger voice on patriotism, tapping into our generation's love of the quirky and random by showing America for many of its quirky, random components--like the underground snack bar in Carlsbad Caverns or how preparing cornbread dressing can make you contemplate death. My favorite essay, ""The Nerd Voice"", I think perfectly translates that youthful randomness-bordering-on-apathy into an expression of what would be and is appealing in terms of elections and government, and it made me care about voting like I never have before."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed. I love Sarah Vowell, but this wasn't her best. Still, it was better than some other commentaries out there, but just not as witty (but always just as insightful) as I would have expected."
1,I just don't get it.,I dont know why this book got so many good reviews. Some parts of the book are funny but for the most part I found it to be whiny and pointless. I thought I was getting a history book that may have some interesting stories in it. Instead I got a book on current events with the theme Republican's are evil. In general I found this book to be yucky and depressing.Also I think Sarah watches too many movies because every other page is a reference to one. Then she has to explain why the reference is significant and by the time she gets back to what she was talking about I found myself yearning for her to come to the point already. Then I discovered there really was no point.
3,"Uneven, but mostly funny","If you have never read Sarah Vowell and you would like to get the flavour of this book, give her a listen on National Public Radio. Her voice is consistent between the written and spoken word. She is very political and very Democratic, so that informs her writing. If open bias bothers you, or that particular bias bothers you, give this book a miss.The Buffy bit was very amusing, as were some of the historical passages. Some of the rest I found less. However, humour is notoriously subjective, so your mileage may vary.I found this book good reading on a gray, rainy day. It's not Pulitzer material, but it is a bit of sunshine for a dreary afternoon."
3,"great read, engaging","I enjoyed Sarah Vowell's writing style, she portrays her odd interest in our history as normal and amusing, making you think twice about how you originally percieved history."
4,Fun History,Sarah Vowell makes history fun. I love the way she can take losts of silly facts and put meaning to them.
2,A mess overall,"This was almost a disappointment from the moment that I opened the product as one of the pens I received ran out of ink even before I had used it. Also, the picture on the cover shows the use of at least four varieties of beads but only three were given in the box. Once I began making the pens, the sticky tape that they gave to put on the pens became very hard to manage and wouldn't stick on to cover the entire pen. After that when I put the beads on the pen, most of them wouldn't stick on at all and the ones that did somewhat began to fall off. In the end, I don't think I'll buy any product from this company again."
2,For the Soul of the People,This book was delivered in time. However it is written on almost every page with both underlining and highlighting. I absolutely loathe books like this and wouldn't want it if it were free. It's so distracting I doubt if I will read it. I am diappoited bc this is a book of significance. There aren't many copies that were not priced highly. So that's the story on this purchase. Btw this is the only bad review I've ever made.
5,CullensAbcs.com Review of Santa's Stuck,"Length:: 1:14 MinsCullen of CullensAbcs.com reviews this book and gives you ideas on how to use to use it interactively with your child.

5,Nice....,"Love this sugar! Tastes wonderful! Shipping is too pricey though. Yet, I'll likely order more.... yeah, it's that good."
2,This is a lemon!!,"This product has lots of issues.Like no sound, or sometimes will just not be recognized.It seems to work with some software like Albeton but it does not like Cakewalk in general.Also even the mixer has been released for a while already, Alesis has not provided any real fixes for these problems.No wonder why the price cuts!!"
5,To do the job right you need these gaskets,Gaskets are far superior than OE design plus they installed and sealed everything up perfectly. If done right these gaskets will last the life of the vehicle.
1,Not for both models,The gaskets do not fit my 3.1 malibu being that my 3.1's plenum was made a bit larger than this one so if you have the larger sized 3.1 engine do not get this it will not fit
5,Loving family pendant,I bought one of these pendants for myself and liked it so much I bought another one for my sister as a surprise. The pendant itself is very pretty and good quality sterling silver. It looks just like the picture. Remember to look at the dimensions specified in the description if you order one. I bought the small size - it is not a big pendant. If you prefer a larger piece you may want to consider the large size pendant. I personally love the small one and so does my sister. Specify if this is a gift- it comes with a nice gift box. The only thing I didn't love is the chain - it is pretty thin and has a pretty small clasp. But it does the job so I still rated it a 5 overall. Of course you can always put the pendant on another favorite chain if you like. I recommend this pendant for anyone looking for a special and meaningful gift for all the family oriented ladies out here!
5,My wife loved it...,...so 5 stars. For the price it seems like a great value and is well made and packaged. The chain is about what you would expect at this price point.
5,Great Gift,My wife was thrilled with it. It's everything and more. It embodies the family in a unique kind of way.
4,Review of Loving Family Silver Pendant,"The Pendant was beautiful, I would have preferred a slightly larger chain as the chains that are provided almost don't fit the ""average"" persons neck, instead become a 'choker' of sorts. Otherwise I was quite pleased with my order.One other comment is that I had to call on the order. It hadn't arrived and I was told by company the ""Post Office"" ""lost"" my order. They did send another pendant; did not charge additional postage, it did arrive in time, but had I not kept on top of it the item would not have been received when needed."
5,Just what my sister wanted,"I bought this as a gift for my sister who just had her 3rd baby and she loved it. We both almost cried and couldn't stop hugging, she loved it so much. It was the perfect gift! She liked that it was sterling silver (as opposed to silver plated) and I loved that I could afford to buy it for her. The design is subtle and it is the perfect size pendant. I got one for myself too (different family size) but am loving it. Will buy the bronze if our family size changes. I would give this 10 stars if I could."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I picked this up at a used book store, so luckily I didn't waste much money on it. What a stupid book this was! The characters were boring, the dialogue was hokey with words like ""yonder"" and ""ye"". And the title does not fit the book. There is no revenge. It's just about a woman who goes back to her hick home town to defend her brother. This book is a waste of time!"
2,Hurl Away,"This was a pretty bad book. It was all so predictable and the strive for that down home flavor came out rather burnt. What's with all these lawyer books anyway but a response to what's popular these days. Fifteen years or so ago it was cop books, now anything with a scent of lawyers is a sell, and this one could've been better. Heck, I could write a dang lawyer book and I don' know nuttin'. Don't waste your hard earned dollars, or your data weary brain on this one."
2,Boring!,Beginning started out fine and then I kept waiting for the plot to thicken. Never happened. At times I felt like throwing it off to the side and starting a new book but thought it has to get more interesting. Never happened. The title does not fit the book. There was no real sense of revenge. Very disappointed. I certainly do not plan on loaning this book out to any friends.
4,hydraulic steering,"This was a replacement of the original BayStar system on my boat. The first one got pitting on the cylinder rods and then the fluid got contaminated and the pump failed. So careful cleaning and maintenance are needed for long life. the original lasted 6 years with poor maintenance I will be more careful with this one. Other than that the system works very well, easy steering thoughout the range of motion. Installation was fairly simple because I was replacing an existing identical system but I think even for a first time installation it would be easy. The directions were accurate and straightforward and templates for mounting are supplied. I'm not crazy about the system not being able to maintain a constant center position on the steering wheel but i guess that is inherent in all hydraulic systems. Perhaps rubber boots to keep salt spray off of the cylinder rods would be a good addition to this otherwise very satisfactory kit."
5,personal opinion of the batstar steering kit,"the baystar steering kit was well constructed,and the installation instructions were easy to follow.I was disappointed with the effort required to steer my boat.Troubleshooting guide says to look for kinks in the hydraulic iineas or incomplete drilled fittings.At this writting I havent found a solution."
5,Fresh and Fun!,"I love this book! I love to celebrate holidays and milestones with close friends, loving family and delicious food! I truly enjoy preparing food for others. This book is going to go a long way in helping me feed and celebrate with those I love! I can't wait to try entire menus, complete with music and beverage/wine recommendations! The menus in the book are fresh and bright and easy enough for a novice cook like me. The pages come alive with incredible pictures of both food and celebration! This is the first cook book I own that I can't put down ... I want to read it, not just duplicate a recipe from it! I have a feeling I'll be celebrating holidays and occasions I never did before, just so I can make these scrumptous menus! I can't wait to Celebrate!"
5,As expected...,Very good and as exepected. I needed the loger cord to run through a wall to the television. Quality was good. I am using it for my wii.
1,Horrible No star,"This product came in a crushed box, It looked like it had been run over with with the p.o.s truck it came out of. So I unbox this CPU Which in the add said ""remanufactured"" this part what full of dirt and oil it looked as tho they yanked it out of a junk yard put it in the box and shipped it. The bolts had never even been touched by a tool, FALSE ADVERTISMENT in the fullest this part not worth the money to become just as usefull as a paper weight severely disappointed."
4,fabulous ideas,i love srini! this book is outstanding. tons of my favorite stickers were in here.my only disappointment was that these are paper stickers. i incorrectly assumed that these would be vinyl stickers like what are sold on the website.
3,"Great stickers, except...","The text on the stickers is great, and I'm glad to finally be able to get them all in one big book rather than buying them individually (for a lot more).However... the adhesive on the stickers is really, really, REALLY weak. They won't even stick to a non-completely-flat surface, and even on an ideal surface they come off VERY easily. After two days, some of them have started to peel THEMSELVES off.Now, this might be a result of the book being shipped to Minnesota in the winter and having been exposed to extreme cold, but I gave it over 24 hours to get back to room temperature and have been using the thing at an ambient 66 degrees. Stickers should stick at 66 degrees.So, cool stickers, but you need a glue-stick to actually stick them."
3,Where's the stick,Witty stickers that could have gone without the little plug for sticker nation under each sticker.My biggest problem with the collection is that the stickers are just not *sticky.*How can I vandalize if they can peel off the stickers?
5,Best gift yet!!,I have bought multiple copies of this book for gifts. It is a huge hit with all ages - from teenagers to youthful adults. Buy several to keep on hand. You won't be sorry.
2,Very Cool Collection but Disappointing,"While all the slogans are great and the amount of stickers is more than enough, I was quite disappointed in the quality. The description above clearly says the sticker are vinyl. They are not and seem to be paper. Either way they barely stick to anything I put them on if at all and are easily damaged when wet. Sure its a book of cheap stickers but I was really hoping they would last on my car more than a trip to the store before falling off. I suppose if you're looking to sloganize your workspace or public places then go ahead and get the book. If you're looking for quality stickers spend a few bucks on select slogans and go for quality."
1,Did not fulfill order!,"I never received this book from the company after numerous contacts made with the owner. He kept assuring me that they would send it out, but never did. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY! THEY DO NOT FULFILL ORDERS!"
1,Crappy adhesive,"The stickers like everyone else has said, have interesting sayings and slogans.However, the stickers will not stick to anything at all.. I just ended up throwing them out because they will not stick to anything. not even my locker at work. Which all stickers beside these have stuck to."
3,"Well written, but boring","To enjoy ""Yo-yo Boing!"", you need to dominate both the English and Spanish languages, as the author shifts back and forth between the languages during the book.The book is basically composed of dialogues -changing speakers, situations and characthers without transition- working as the flow of thoughts inside our minds. It is interesting, and I must grant that Braschi is a superb writer in terms of playing with words and styles.The first half -in which she blames her boyfriend for her lack of inspiration, when she is really suffering from lazyness and writer's block- is extremely funny. However, the second half is a complete dissapointment, with a lot of so called intellectuals talking about how important they are because of poetry and art. I had to push myself to end this book."
1,Hopeless,"Don't bother. I mean, really. Don't bother.Awful isn't the half of it. Impenetrable. A poseur.Run away screaming.Seriously."
3,"Yo, Yo, BORING","I would imagine that the book evolved from notes the author took from conversations she overheard or engaged in while living in New York. Some of it is interesting, but most of it is the self-involved blathering of Bohemian bores.This book is one continuous dialogue with no quotation marks. This ""groundbreaking"", piece of ""literary liberation"" reminds me of the shelves I just put up, a slow and tedious work. Although there are a few gems of enlightenment, for the most part the book was as exciting as watching the paint dry on my new shelves.To continue the analogy, my shelves ended up being strong and unified, of sound construction with the purpose of holding books. This work is disjointed, nailed crooked, and lacks any discernible purpose. Of course, one must take into consideration that I am a sardine packed tightly in the can of convention."
1,FOR AMERICANS ONLY,"A WORD OF ADVICE: IT SEEMS ONLY USA RESIDENTS SEEM TO ENJOY IT, NOT THOSE IN PUERTO RICO..."
1,GARBAGE,"NAME-THROWING, BEEN THERE-DONE THAT, CRUDE, ARROGANT GARBAGE SPICED UP WITH MEANINGLESS VERBORRHEA. DEFINITELY PULITZER MATERIAL IN THIS BIZARRE CATEGORY! GOOD BEFORE BEDTIME; IT WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP IN MINUTES."
5,a mockery of celebrity life and academic writing,"If you're frigid and hypersensitive, stay away from this book. If you love Fellini's 8 1/2, John Kennedy Toole's Confederacy of Dunces, and Woody Allen's Annie Hall--this book is for you. Of course, you ought to be bilingual."
2,I give up: this book is unreadable,"I've read the first chapter at least 10 times, and believe me, I don't mind doing a little literary heavy lifting. I love James Joyce, and some of the other authors mentioned by reviewers who liked this book.Maybe it gets better, but the first chapter with this unknown character picking at her blemishes and fantasizing about sucking out all the pus, and rubbing her own breasts.... sorry. Not for me."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I found ""Yo-Yo Boing"" very difficult to read, confusing (perhaps it's over my head) and boring. I was turned off completely in the first pages by a detailed description of the popping of a zit in the most detailed description one can imagine. It went on for pages. It reminded me of the Richard Brautigan books ( which I enjoyed) but with a twist of the disgusting and mundane. It seemed to be a disconnected stream of consciousness type of writing which I do not enjoy. It seemed to me like a disconnected soap opera with characters that were not likeable. I found myself skipping and jumping my way through the book just to get through it. The book has gotten some great reviews but it is not for me. No good recommendation here."
1,It was horrible,I got this book and it's full of mistakes with poor explanations. It is horrible and after reading it I got so confused. Do NOT purchase this book. YOu have been warned!
3,Review of Kelly's 'Russian Literature',"I agree with the sentiment of the two earlier reviewers. Kelly's decision to move through Pushkin as a representative of Russian literature's long history led me to miss out on the various perspectives of other great writers. Although the work did attempt to introduce me to Pushkin's social and political context, and the later development of his authorial figure within the development of Russian history, I still would have appreciated an introduction to more authors. I feel that I know Pushkin, not Russia. Still, I appreciate Kelly's decision to make a bold move within the Very Short series, and though I feel this work fell flat, I did not fail to notice the artistic quality of prose, or her precise ability to structure the entire work around a single piece of poetry."
4,Nice,This is plenty loud enough! Easy to mount and wire in. Driving down the freeway at 70mph I can hear it! LOL
3,"Decent, but not powerful","I got this for spotting for my brother when we offroad together. It isn't powered, so I wasn't expecting much from it. It isn't quite loud enough for what I want, but It will have to do for now. I'm going to eventually replace it with a Deputy Watt Electronic Siren, as it will provide more power to the speaker. I may even end up replacing the speaker as well."
2,Poor package inspection,"This item was broken when I opened it. It was shipped with several other items that are all ok. All the items were individually packaged and then placed in a master carton along with packing material. No cartons were damaged during shipping. That is, none of the individual cartons nor the master carton were damaged. In other words, I suspect this item was broken when it was originally packed. Does not speak well of Pyramid for product inspection."
1,Don't waste your time!!,"When I first saw this, I thought it would be great to use for my rabbit. I saw it as a great alternative to feeding loose hay. I especially thought it would reduce the mess of hay left all over the rabbit's cage. I was completely wrong. Not only does hay still get everywhere, but it is constantly falling off the side of the cage and the hay spills EVERYWHERE. In fact, this has left a bigger mess than when I used to feed my rabbit loose hay in a bowl! Another issue I had with this was that the ""snap-lock lid"", stopped ""snapping"" after about a week of use. The lid no longer locks, therefore leading, once again, to a BIG ol' mess.Then again, what can you expect for something so cheap? I say, spend the extra $$ and get something that will actually be affective and last more than a week :)"
1,doesnt work very well,"i wanted something to contain hay so that t didnt get wasted just thrown in the cage, my bunny likes the feeder put its very hard to keep the top on it; so it was basically a waste of money, i dont recommend it"
1,completely waste of your money,"You would think this product is cheap, right? wrong! This thing sells for around [...] bucks. But it's actually a [...] cents quality product. Very cheap material. very cheap plastic won't last at all. It's also very small, not much hay can be put in. The mount part is also a joke. Don't even think about this thing if you seriously think of getting a feeder for your buns."
2,Not good for chinchillas,It's a waste of money - my chin ate it within two weeks and the hay still gets everywhere. Having plastic in the cage that a chin can eat is dangerous. I thought it'd be made of hard plastic but it's soft and easy for them to munch.
1,shipped my item with a missing part and still have not taken care of the situation,"i ordered the super pet hay buffet feeder, it was shipped to me on time but it was shipped out the locking lid wich made the whole feeder useless with out the lid. i just wanted them to send me the lid but for some reason that has been to much to ask for"
2,Not recommended for guinea pigs,i bought this item about a year ago and its been in my drawer since 2 months after i bought it. for starters my guinea has a hard time getting to the hay and if he reaches some of it theres always some he cannot reach. THE THING STRESSES HIM OUT! i could not leave it in his cage at night because i would hear him pulling on it and screaming at it. I have since then gotten him a hang troth and he seems to like this much better. i don't know how it works for rabbits but guinea pigs are a no go for this item. if you feel you simply must have something to hold your pets hay get a hang bowl or troth so theres not so much stressful work for your pet to reach their food.
3,It's ok,I use this product for my Guinea pigs. They like to take the hay out of the top instead of the slats on the sides. So they pull out a lot and still make a big mess/waste a lot of hay.
1,Super Pet Rabbit Hay Buffect Feeder,"The item arrived with the Snap-Lock Lid not snapping, locking or even staying on. I filled the item with hay and when I next checked on my pets, the item was on the bottom of their cage and the hay was all over the cage. I am very unimpressed and unhappy. Don't waste your money."
1,Too difficult to get hay out.,"I thought this looked like a good idea, but actually my bunny can't get the hay out of it. Instead she knocks it down everyday so she can eat out of the top- and when she can't knock it down, she doesn't eat any.I would NOT buy this again. You might as well put the hay in a bowl."
2,cheaply made,My first impressions of this item was that it was cheaply made. The lid won't stay latched and it falls off the cage very easily. The notch was bent on one side making it so I couldn't hang it up on that side
2,Shame on the record companies that release inferior-quality product.,"I purchased this CD and was very disappointed because of the poor sound quality. This was obviously not made from the original masters as the volume is very low and the music has no dynamic range whatsoever. Instead of buying this inferior-quality CD I recommend your buying the ""Una Dimension De Exitos"" CD because its sound quality is MUCH better in every way."
2,"Pianfull at times, errata required!","This exam prep is very much like the rest of this Exam Cram series... a noble attempt at helping people pass an exam; unfortunately it turns out to be an exercise in how NOT to write a book.Typos are rampant, errors in syntax and command lines abound, and large sections of the LPI objectives for 102 are missing.This book will NOT aid you in your LPI testing, but it should be owned by anyone planning to write a technical exam prep, as a great example on how NOT to do it...."
1,Errors!,"Here's a good example of how bad this book is because of all the errors. Chapter 8 is a review of the basics of the bash shell. It says on page 173 ""Processes are covered in great detail in Chapter 6..."". Chapter 6 in this book is about the vi editor, not processes, but Chapter 6 in the Exam Cram LPI 101 book is all about processes. They are just copying and pasting out of another book at this point, and they obviously aren't proof reading it. There are TONS of errors in this book. This is the worst Exam Cram book of all time!"
3,"Helpful, but pay attention","After LPI 101, it seemed like I needed something to help me study for 102. This seemed like my best bet. It certainly did prepare me for passing the test, but not by a huge margin. Don't expect to be seeing a 700+ score if you're depending on this to get you there.Another problem is that there are a lot of errors within the book itself, especially the review questions. You'll find yourself being told you answered a question wrong, only to flip back a few pages and see the answer you'd given.Another problem is that the typeface was poorly selected for much of the book. There is no visible difference between a capitol i and a lowercase L, for example. When you're dealing with command switches, that can be a significant issue. There are also a number of typos that nobody caught in editing.All in all, it was helpful, and I would recommend the book. But pay attention; don't take everything as fact."
2,Full of Errors and Typos,"The title explains it all. Your better off with O'Reilly's LPI in a Nutshell. The O'Reilly book covers both the 101 and 102 exams. The Exam Cram LPI 101 book was okay, but the 102 book is terrible."
1,Only mistakes,"Ok tell me a page numberpage 111....Page 110 and 111 contains some printouts of installing a debian package. If you are surprised, what each of these lines mean, you are out of luck. This book doesnt explain or even try to explain any of that. After you go through the 5 pages dedicated for debian package manager, when you look back, you realise that the actual information content could have been given in half a page or so.The coverage of each topic is like that in this book. Like someone else suggested, pl go to the nearest book store and see this book for yourself.LPI Prep kit on the other hand is excellent compared to this."
5,Good Content; Good Writing,"I happened across this book while reading an excerpt from it in UnixReview. LPI had just starting shipping certificates (what good is a certification without a certificate?), so I decided to see just how hard the exams were. I have been a Unix junkie for about ten years, and a Linux convert for two. Before buying anything, I looked at my reference library and found that Chris Hare and Emmett Dulaney - the same two authors here - had written Inside Unix; one of the only books that has had the staying power to still be a good reference seven years after I bought it. Without hesitation, I bought the LPI I and II Exam Crams and found the writing style and knowledge to be of the same high calibre. Epilogue: I passed both exams the first time out."
3,a little too tinny - I would have liked a heavier piece,These pieces - I ordered one for each of the births of my grandsons -just didn't measure up to the pictures. I thought they would be a heavier piece. The edges were so thin they actually seemed sharp. I was happy I had something to give my girls when my grandsons were born but I wish the pieces were more substantial.
5,chain broke bu they sent another.,the chain was broke but they sent another so no problems. I'm happy with it
5,Excellent product and speedy delivery,Purchased this item as a gift for my mom. Came in a display box that was perfect to wrap and open. Contained all authenticity in the box.
3,Great concept but not the best quality,I ordered this as a gift for a my sister-in-law and was a bit disappointed. I really like the idea behind the mother and children but the overall quality of both the packaging and necklace/pendant itself wasn't up to par with the price tag. I ended up feeling like I was giving her a much cheaper gift than what I actually paid for it.
5,Very pleased,"This was the perfect gift for my daughter. It was very good quality with a sturdy chain. It was was a perfect size, not too big, not too small. I would recommend this."
5,Mother's Necklace,"My daughter loves this necklace, which I purchased for my infant granddaughters to present her on Christmas. The pendant is well-constructed. The chain is very lightweight and will need replacing. However, for the price, I assumed I would have to replace it. It does allow her to wear it until we get a stronger one."
1,disappointed,I had previously purchased a mother child necklace and liked it so much when another child came along I wanted the same one with 2 children. The picture shows an all silver necklace but the one I received had white enamel in the middle and that changed the entire appearance of it. The picture shows all silver. The white doesn't look good at all.
2,Item too small,The mother and children pendant was way too small. The piece looks cheap and more suited as a jewelry piece for a kid.
3,symbolizes unity,Nice pendant and chain. Not sure it's totally worth the price though. What it represents means more to me. I will keep it of course but won't recommend it.
1,tarnished and flimsy,This arrived today for my mothers birthday and it's tarnished and cheap looking. I would be embarrassed to give this to her. I will be returning it tomorrow.
3,"Not as ""3D"" as it appears","the item isn't as impressive as the picture appears. Very flat and not as 3D as I had hoped it would be. For the price, it isn't a bad gift though!"
3,was not what i had hoped for,i have a family of 4 not a family a of 3. description of this necklace was deceiving! i would like to return it.
3,Poor Custoemr Service,"The item was not delivered as per estimation/guarantee. Unfortunately I was also never given any kind of information of the status of the shipment either. it ended up arriving 4 days after i contacted customer support. When I call them all they could tell was ""It has been shipped"". The only relief I had was when it did finally arrive and it at least was as promised in size and beauty. I don't believe I will be a frequent customer with this seller though."
2,Just okay..cheap looking...wife didn't like it!,"I was hopeful on this item reading other reviews but when it came, it was in a cheap looking box and looked cheap. The chain is something you would see in a gum machine and is flimsy and will break easily. The charm is not 3D but more flat and is not heavy, also looks cheap. It appeared like it would be nicer, but wasn't. My wife looked at it on Xmas and was disappointed sadly. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Lovely and petite,"This was a gift for my mother which she loved, the only thing is that it is a little smaller than I thought. Also the necklace is going slightly darker, which makes me wonder if it is real silver. Besides that the actually charm is gorgeous."
1,Poor quality,My son bought it for his mom for mothher's day.I must say the packaging was acceptable but the chain started to turn grey to black within one week of use.This has disappointed my son because it is the first time he has actually purchase something for his mom.I am presently seeking my money back.
3,Its nice idea,"I did like it because I ran out of ideas for my sister in law, when I received it looks like on picture but the chain is very cheap looking. The price for the quality received is good although the chain is really bad imo."
2,Cheap Quality!,"The pictures shown are very favorable to the product. The product itself 'looks' as cheap as it feels. Not the choice for a decerning jewelry lover. I was very dissappointed, but I accept it as my fault. Like the old saying, ""Shop cheap....Shop twice!"""
5,Great gift,A great conversation piece and a perfect gift for the person who has everything. It is colorful and attractive plus has a scientific and historical background.
5,Galileo thermometer,"This is an interesting novelty piece. We purchased this one as a gift for someone who commented about how much he liked ours. I'm not sure how much one can say about a thermometer, but it works based on the laws of physics. Thus, it would make a nice gift for children in school as well."
4,The most important Supreme Court Case of the 20th Century,"There is no mention of Linda Brown on the entire video. After watching this I really wished that the Supreme Court case were named Briggs v Elliot so that school kids would grow up learning this story. 5 cases were grouped together under the title Brown v Board. With All Deliberate Speed focuses on Davis v Prince Edward County and Briggs v Elliot. The story is very inspirational in that young and old African-Americans knew their constitutional and natural rights, fought for them, and through their actions ended de jure segregation at the federal level. This DVD does not go on to the state battles in places like Little Rock and Ole Miss. I wish Gilbert would do a second video on the battles it took to enforce the Brown v Board decision."
5,Variety,"I had this Cd already, and just love the songs. I broke the old one, so I was delighted to be able to replace it. It has a variety of artists and songs, different styles. I recommend it to anyone who likes variety in their music."
2,"Noteworthy for ""Mary Did You Know""","Clay Aiken's rendition of Mary Did You Know as included in this collection is not the same as the recording on his album Mary Christmas With Love, which makes this CD a rarity. For Clay Aiken fans, this is a collector's item.I personally did not care for any of the other songs included on this CD, which is why I am giving it 2 stars."
2,Adequate,"This cd didn't do much for me. It has an interesting mix of performers but only a few songs really stood out.Rachael Yamagata's ""The River"" is probably my favorite song on the album. This up and coming singer really provided a beautiful version of this less familiar Christmas song.Dido's ""Christmas Day"" is another beautiful song. This seems to be the ""go to"" song for her when it comes to Christmas compilation albums, as I've heard it on other compilation albums.Jerry Camp gives a nice rendition of ""O Come All Ye Faithful."" He does justice to this Christmas Classic.All in all this is not a bad album, it's just not that great either. I wouldn't expect anyone to waste time hunting this album down but if you happen to come across it at a decent price I doubt you will regret purchasing it."
1,Awful Presentation,"Ok..if you know these films you know them. Buy at your own risk and all. I love Hellraiser and so I was happy to buy up these movies cheap....little did I know...This collection is a one disc set with HEAVY COMPRESSION. It looks awful especially on my HDTV. I am very disappointed, but luckily I bought it for cheap ($8) so I don't feel too bad. No special features and terrible picture quality makes this ONE disc a coaster."
1,Disappointing at best.,"I bought this album because of the great reviews given on amazon. I love vocal trance music but this album just didn't do it for me. It lacks something. The music is not catchy. It's boring and her voice is quite terrible, really terrible.Wish I could get a refund."
2,A let down,The writing needs some work. This album probably won't see significant rotation in my playlists
2,NOT a New Version for 2007,"I am a long time user of Calendar Creator and purchased this ""new"" version because my version 12 has been hanging anytime you try to use the file menu. Broderbund had no tech support solutions to resolve that issue, so I hoped that a new version of the software would correct it.To my disappointment, Calendar Creator Platinum is NOT a new edition, but merely version 12 repackaged. If you have version 12 under the Calendar Creator Deluxe package, you already have this software. Even the installation images still use the CC Deluxe pictures.Now I'm stuck with two copies of software that doesn't want to work (the ""new"" version has the exact same problem as the ""old"" version)."
2,This product is unimproved,"I have every version of Calendar Creator in the past 8 years. I had Deluxe 12 and bought 2007 Platinum only to find that it is identical to 12. I have written the company 7 emails about program problems; never got a reply and they never fixed the problems. Version 12 continues to have some serious printing issues and also randomly moves events. This is fundamentally a good program, but the company needs to fix the bugs and bring out a really new version without the confusing version naming."
1,Not compatable with Windows 7,I talked with their sales people today and they are working on one for Windows 7. I have used this program for years and am lost without it.
2,This program bites!,"All i waqnted to do was make a calendar like 99% of those you buy in every store with a cover page, then a picture above a month etc.. This program seems to be unable to make the calendar much less collate the pages so they print in the proper order to be able to turn the page to the next month! This feature is possible in Printmaster which is by the same manufacturer. Use the calendar function in Printmaster, don't waste your money on this thing!"
5,Easy to use,This for me is very easy to use. The blocks are large and easy to fillI received it in just a few days. I like it.
4,A different chronicle of the civil war,"The American civil war was the defining event in American social cohesion and fortunately, it was also the first event that could be permanently chronicled with photos. While Mathew Brady is the best known photographer of that time, there were others who also contributed to the permanent record. Andrew Russell was a photographer whose work dealt primarily with the Railroad Corps of the Union Army as it moved through Virginia. As such, his photos are rarely of battle scenes, they show us buildings, bridges, brestworks and encampments.While these photos lack the immediate power of battle scenes, they are very well done and show a different side of the war. The clarity and detail in the pictures are amazing, in some cases, you can even count the bricks on the sides of the buildings. Russell was an excellent photographer, his work is simple, yet powerful as it shows us the physical structure of two sides of a society at war with itself."
5,HYPO TEARS,"I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL BRANDS OF EYE PRODUCTS. HYPO TEARS IS THE ONLY BRAND THAT WORKS FOR ME ,UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GETTING TOO EXPENSIVE WHICH HURTS IF YOUR ON LIMITED INCOME."
5,One of the best eye drops on the market,I am surprised at how much I like these eye drops. I have tried so many others in the past with very little benefit. Hypo tears helps me where most others do not. I have severely dry eyes and have found at least a little relief with this brand.
3,Mostly a Storybook,"Though I realized when I purchased this item I would not be getting an ""art of"" book like that of Dreamworks or Pixar movies, I still held out hope that maybe there would be some concept art near the end of the book. Unfortunately I was wrong. This book, though charming and filled with screenshots from the movie and the accompanying short, does not have any concept art and is wholly a story book. The only text in it describes what happens in the movie, scene for scene with screenshots to help move the story along. I recommend this book for people who want Pokemon memorabilia but not as an ""art of"" book to get a better understanding of what went into making the Pokemon movie."
3,Art of Pokemon 3,This is a great reference if you loved the 3RD Pokemon Movie. It tells about the characters and Pokemon in the movie. It also has a section about the mini movie Pikachu and Pichu! <(o^-^o)>
3,Not Anything Special,"Not as soft as you would expect a microfiber cloth to be. Also, the material was cut as a square, but then when they were sewing the sides, they must have done it too tight, because when you lay it down, it kind of curves upward, and won't stay flat (it is not because it has been rolled up in a box). Does not look as perfect as the picture, but I may have just gotten a bad pack."
5,Microfiber Cloths,I am very pleased Never knew how great they do in cleaing # 1 Glass cleaner or on mirrors
1,Beware of the last chapter in this book!,"I read this book with my daughter until the last chapter, when the two sisters have a disturbing conversation about their neighbors. It seems the neighbors are not nice, but the sisters speak hatefully of them and even compare them to Hitler!(I am not kidding) For being written in 1994, this book is shocking in its wording, full of mean comments and giggles about others. For those with a strong value system and rules about how others are spoken of and treated, do not buy this book."
4,A hyserically funny and real story of lesbians,"Serial Monogamy is the story of all lesbians. The processing, the search of good loving is a constant in every lesbian life. Or that it seems. Sociologically fabulous."
2,This is not a glorifying novel,"The author may be the son of Message-renowned Eugene Peterson, but Leif's novel is not a Christian novel. It deals with Christian themes, certainly, but let's look at the characters. The protagonist is agnostic and drinks heavily. Perry and Juliana have premarital sex and get pregnant, and this is considered fine. By marketing this novel as ""Christian,"" the publishing house has bought into American culture which states that the Bible is good but not absolute and certainly not worthy of talking about. Likewise, sin is acceptable and doesn't need to be dealt with. I offended by the characters and annoyed that I wasted 12 bucks on this book."
4,Readings On Heart Surgery!,This book was put together to give you the essays and observations of noted heart surgeon Denton Cooley. In many ofthese essays you are given insight into the many facets of heart surgery that Cooley has done in his career. He also gives you his opinion on the effectiveness of heart surgery in thetreatment of heart disease.You are also told by Dr Cooley about doing one of the first heart transplants.These are very concise and informative readings on the career of Dr. Denton Cooley.Readthis. You will find it to be very interesting.
3,not as good...,"Wow, I hate to be the first reviewer to give less than five stars. I've loved every Kelley Armstrong book so far, but this one just didn't grab me. The whole book felt like a wild goose-chase, and just didn't hold my interest as all her other books have."
3,just fine,"exactly what I expected, cheese werewolf story, great when you're short on time and don't want to get into a really good book."
2,Feh,I have read all the Elena books and realized i cant stand her. I didnt even finsh the book. Clay is such a polarizing character who hates all humans and has no redeeming qualities that i cant stop thinking while i read the book how stupid Elena is to be with him. He bit her on purpose while in werewolf form to make her like him because he hates all humans but wanted to be with her. Nothing romantic about that. He doesnt care if humans live or die. What a prince. Too douchey for me. Im out
4,Book 6 of 7,"I did not feel this was one of the best books in the series. I am very partial to her first two books, Bitten and Stolen. However, I appreciate how she carries her characters through all the books and creates new story lines for each of them."
5,Love it!!!!,"In this, the 6th book of the series, we go back to Clay, Elena and Jeremy! These, by far, are my favorite characters of the series.Elena may have unwittingly unleashed Jack the Ripper on twenty-first-century--and become his next target. On a tip from Xavier (character from ""Stolen"" book 2 of the series), Clay and Antonio go after a mutt killing women. In return for this tip, Clay, Elena and Jeremy must steal the elusive ""From Hell"" Letter from a supernatural collector. They agree to the terms and after stealing the letter, they unwittingly unlock a portal with a drop of Elena's blood, presumably unleashing Jack the Ripper into the 20th century!With Elena pregnant, Jeremy and Clay try to keep her as uninvolved with the mission as possible. But we all know Elena...that doesn't sit well!"
3,Wasn't thrilled but loved Elena too much to not read,"I have to admit Kelley Armstrong's use of sex and violence really makes the werewolf series.This book confused me a little during most of the plot. The reader isn't really given all of the info up until the second to last chapter and i think I would have liked it better if it made more sense.I also disliked a pregnant woman being in those situations, but I did think it was a good way to keep the reader hooked."
4,The Otherworld Series Just Keeps Getting Better,"Elena's back and preggers, Who could ask for anything more- but we get more with Jaime Vegas on board helping out as well as the recalcitrant Jeremy. Ms. Armstrong builds strong three dimensional characters that you really care about and then puts them in positions of peril. Were these not such strong women you might worry but Ms. Armstrong's women are so capable, you never really worry too much.If she keeps writing them, I'll keep reading them. It's the best thing since Buffy,"
1,1 Star 2 many,"How can I help you with this review? I think the easiest thing is to say DON'T READ. simple. As simple as the writing and the annoying plot. There we go again with all the running around, and no one able to figure anything out. The werewolves are sweet and all, but I wouldn't want them helping me out..."
3,"enjoyable read, and an interesting take on the supernatural","Although it doesn't have the snap and sizzle of some other authors, I really enjoyed Kelley Armstrong's werewolves, and the situations they find themselves in.Festering wounds, aggressive rat swarms, and dubiously reliable allies make this an enjoyable read.the ""bored"" reviewer needs to read a little better - or again- because they got some of the facts wrongGood stuff and solid writing; maybe not ready for the awards yet, but this writes shows definite promise and is a solid storyteller"
5,Another page turner in the Women of the Underworld Series!!,Loved it! Stayed up all night to finish it. Though from what I understand this is not the last of the books that have Elena as the protagonist. The last chapter is just fantastic. Hope the author does not leave us waiting too long for the next book.
1,very disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this publication. Nowhere in the description did it say what age group it was for. Since it mentioned underarm hair, pubic hair and menstruation, I assumed it was for teenagers. My boy is a teenager. It was written for much younger children. I wasted my money."
2,It's Ok,"I was getting a filing system in place besides that I am a neat freak, I want my husband, and need him to be organize for our future sake. So I saw this product and I thought wow I can stuff all my files in here in just one place! Which is great and can be done, but I wasn't too impressed with the look. It just looked different than from what I was expecting. It is pretty big and can hold either legal or letter size files."
1,Terrible,This band is god awful. I saw them live once and it made wish for death. Thank god they finally broke up. Maybe they'll be good at something else.
1,"A mature, immature book","I guess I am the minority with my review. I thought this book was a yawn. Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose. I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point. I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour). I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not. A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings. In my opinion, this book is purely shock value with no substance, so if that is your thing, then go for it."
3,"Interesting, if a bit simple","The entire time I was reading this book I couldn't help but think ""what is the point of all of this?"" The book is written in a sort of ""journalistic"" type of way from the main character's point of view. There is definately plenty of shock value: rape, insest, drug use, prostitution, and so on; but that's really not the point. Upon finishing it you realize it's more about coming to terms with yourself in society and finding a sense of closure and peace, in a sort of extreme, twisted way. In that sense the book succeeds.The writing is pretty simple and you should have no problem finishing this in one sitting, though you may want to read through it one more time and analyze it further."
2,mild disappointment,"I have read the book in about a day; the font is quite big and there are less then 150 pages in total that make the book a good reading for a rainy weekend.The story is fairly captivating at the beginning, but then it letarally goes over the top and it leaves the reader with a doubt about what the author wanted to achieve with such a trama: the protagonist is a girl who turns tricks to afford her expensive clothes and engage in passionate sex with her disable brother, until she finds out that she is the daughter of a semen donor and the story takes unexpected turns.Honsetly, I was expecting something more related to the Enjo kosai than a ""noir""."
5,f**k the rest...,"The horrid reviews stated on here might as well duplicate the relentless gang rape scene of the book. I don't care what anyone says, this book is a sublime read, every word, from start to finish. My only serious disappointment was that I did not ration myself better and finished it too quickly. If I didn't have Hillary Raphael's ""I (heart) Lord Buddha"" to act as methadone, I don't know how I would have handled the withdrawals from such a white-hot stellar piece of work."
4,Twisted sensuality,It was rather bizaar how i found myself strangely aroused throughout this book...Yeah yeah i know she made Love to her brother and biological father but it had a sense of nessesity for them to connect. If you read this book and was disguished i request that you pick it back up with an open mind...If you are looking at this review and deciding whether or not you want to buy this book...stand forewarned...you much keep your mind open and your own judgements closed...
4,everything good except the handle,I used to have a fryer almost the same as this one from Target and I left it to my old roommate. This one is almost as good except that the handle is not as smooth and elegant
5,Veristile,"I love this pan, i fry in it and can do other things. non stick is perfect. just wipe and its so easy.."
5,The Best Yet!,"I absolutely love this product! It is the best piece I have out of my Calphalon products. The quality is excellent! I use it for everything; I haven't used to fry chicken though!Buy this pan, you will love it. It comes in a real Calphalon box which is great as a gift! You won't regret it!"
5,A MUST have for your kitchen!!,I recently purchased several pieces of the Calphalon Cookware. This by far is my most favorite. It is the perfect size for making just about anything and the non-stick factor makes it so much fun to cook. I really did a lot of research to find an everyday pan to cook with. I would recommend that everyone has this piece in their kitchen.
3,Sounds Like Home: Growing Up Black and Deaf in the South,"This book desperately wanted to be ""Having Our Say"" by the Delaney Sisters. Perhaps, if it had an editor, it would have been. As it stands, it provides a historical perspective of African American Deaf culture, but its text does not flow very smoothly."
2,Skintight,"Jax Gallagher is convinced that Treena, his late father's widow, is nothing but a gold digger. Sure she is up to no good, he worms his way into her life, determined to retrieve the valuable baseball in her possession that he wagered away in a card game. However, Treena appears to be nothing like what he imagined her to be. Before long, Jax is again losing something valuable, his heart. So is Treena. However, she does not know the whole story.** Unfortunately, there is something lacking. The story in Skintight never truly achieves its potential. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,Susan Andersen's latest book,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Susan Andersen's previous books. However, this one I found to be pretty much ho-hum. I like to feel involved with the characters but here I could have cared less."
5,Seller Feedback - Purchased Through Amazon,"The book was in the condition specified. The book was very enjoyable. It had some romance, humor, but most of all love and understanding. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes/loves to read."
4,"Sweet and sexy, great escapism read!","I really enjoyed this book, very well on a par compared to her others - Susan never fails to deliver! Good characters and great emotional depth to them. I was glued to it until I finshed and almost sad when it was over."
1,Failed after using it three times!,"I bought this pump to replace one just like it that had lasted over 15 years. I expected to get similar quality, but it failed on its third time out! Under the exact same conditions! They don't make them like they used to."
2,Weak,"Pushes thru a lot of water with nothing attached to it but adding 20 ft of 3/4"" tube going up just 2 feet I got nothing out."
5,Teeter Hang Ups Inversion Table,"We got this inversion table after my sister showed me hers and it has been a regular part of our routine ever since. It definitely has helped my slight scoliosis and vertebrae popping, and my husbands lower back pain and sciatica. It's worth the price as it is very strong and sturdy. Also the ankle locks are comfortable, which is 'muy importante'! The DVD was somewhat helpful, but drags on tremendously long."
2,Be careful,"Before using any inversion therapy talk with your orthopedic doctor as use may aggrevate, inflame, or even cause further damage to those suffering from back pain. There are also studies that show ocular (eye) damage may occur due to the increase in blood pressure. Strokes are also a possibility. Be forewarned."
4,Teeter Hang Up,"I run 15-20 mi. a week so I purchased this product to help with soreness that I sometimes experience in my back after running. It seems to help somewhat but I wouldn't say it completely removes the soreness. I have not had it long enough to determine how great a benefit it will be long term. As for the actual product, it is very well built and easy to assemble. I don't have any experience with other brands but I would imagine this has to be one of the best on the market - it is very sturdy and the video is very helpful. I can't imagine what improvements I would make to the Teeter F5000."
4,F5000 is very good,"Is a very good unit, is easy to put together and simple to fold. Very smooth operation. I would recommend, however, that if you are having back problems, you should get someone to help you put it together as some of the components are a bit on the heavy side.Have had the unit for over a month now, and my back is MUCH better. I don't wake up with back pain anymore. I used to have ""numb"" sensations that ran down my legs, and a constant ""dull"" ache in the lower back that would never go away... but now the pain and numbness are gone.An interesting ""side-affect"" of the table is that it also helps your sinuses! If you have trouble draining, just flip upside-down and get that nasty stuff moving with gravity! If you're prone to sinus-infections because it sits in a ""mass"" inside your head and can't drain, this will help."
2,Teeter Hang Up,Tried the product had it since Saturday Jan 12 product hurts your ankles when flipping upside down make sure you read the return policy they charge 80 dollars for a re stocking fee . I don't think its worth the 300 dollars my lower back still has a pinch that hurts when i am sitting down for long periods of time .
4,Excellent Quality,"Everything about this product is high quality. It is built with quality materials. It's sturdy. The instructions were clear. Even the packaging was high quality. Whether it is helping relieve the sciatica in my leg is debatable, but honestly I don't think I have used it regularly enough yet to tell."
2,returned it. didn't really work out for me,"This is a very well made machine. However, it really did nothing for mine or my husband's bad backs. Its uncomfortable to hang totally upside down and we never really got it at a lesser angle to hang comfortably for long enough to be helpful. Also, its hard to hold your feet stiffly for a long time frame."
2,Placebo effect maybe nothing more,I don't think this thing is doing anything for me --- probably mostly placebo effect unfortunately -- EXPENSIVE and takes up a ton of room
3,Coudn't use it due to WARNINGS about medical conditions,"I've heard such wonderful things about the TEETER hang-up. I have a friend who has this same model and loves it. It helped his back tremendously.It arrived on time, very well made, and a nice DVD for assembly/use.I purchased it online, put it together, THEN watched the enclosed DVD and read the documentation. I was very disappointed that I fell into a category listed in the WARNINGS as a DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I have a hiatal hernia and the product documentation specifically stated NOT to use this product. I called my physician and he would not comment on it's safety (or not), only that I do indeed have this condition. : (NOTE: The list of medical conditions that should NOT use this product is quite extensive.It would have saved me a bit of time if this full list of exclusions would have been listed on the website for the product (excuse me if they were there and I didn't see/find them)."
5,The answer to my health condition!,"This device is the answer to my health condtion. I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction which causes a pinched nerve in my lower back. By using the Teeter Hang Ups F5000 Inversion Table my pinched nerve is eliviated, without having to constantly go to the chiropractor. And not only is it GREAT for my back, I do exercises on it and in only one month I have started to flatten my abdomen. Anyone thinking about buying this inversion table, don't think twice, just do it!!!!!"
5,Inversion,"The Teeter is an excellent exercise for my back, I use it once a day after a heavy day at work...."
5,Love to hang out!,"I have had my F5000 for about 10 years. Purchased after I had a neck injury. Used it along with neuromuscular masage therapy and was able to recover and get off pain meds and avoid recommended surgery. After years of weight lifting and playing sports I still resort to hanging upside down on my table when I get down in my back and for general aches and pains. If you are having problems, I recommend going back gradually, instead of trying to go all the way down to begin with. I find it very refreshing!"
4,tight cd!!!,"If you like Ruthless Juveniles, you will like the Swamp Click!Same beats, same New Orleans sound, simular lyrics.Pick it up! It's a good one. The CD is a ""hard to find"" one as well.Kevin.."
2,The life & music of Sinead. (& a load of other people),"This is a truley awful book. Jimmy Guterman is a great reviewer when he's written for 100's of magazines in the past, but Im afraid he's NOT a very good author. He keeps diverting from the tracks, and not just by a little few yards. Im talking miles. Pages and pages where Sinead isnt mentioned at all. When he mentions someone who Sinead worked with or even just met one day, he goes on and on for the next 4 pages about THEIR work and this leads in turn to people that THEY worked with!!! He also finds it very hard to belive that there are those of us who PREFER 'The Lion & the Cobra' to 'I Do Not Want What I Havent Got'. Just to praise the 2nd album, he spends half the book slagging the debut album off! Its an annoying read, and I only made it from one cover to the other because its about Sinead . . . . .well SOME of its about Sinead."
5,Blanco 511-701 Undermount Sink is EXCELLENT,"We have had this sink since February of 2007 and it has not stained. We use a soft scub cleaner that the instyaller recommended. Our only issue is that it isn't totally granite so when a friend dropped a heavy skillet in it, it left a real small gray dot about the size of a pinhead, which isn't the manufacturer's fault.We would recommend this to anyone unless someone knows of a newer better product."
2,What happened? A dissapointing end to a great series.,"I am a great fan of the Eva series, but seriously, what were they thinking? The last video was an amazing disappointment which did nothing but rehash ideas already discussed in previous episodes. There was no closure whatsoever in this confusing and dissapointing finale. The only thing that saves this video is the alternate universe possibility scene where shinji is shown a world where he is not a Eva pilot, but even this is marred by obvious budget cuts. Pitiful."
4,Mind blowingly GREAT!!!,"This episode is by far one of my favorites in the series. Although after seeing this one you'll never want to see the last twelve again!!Because.. oh, i wont spoil your fun. This episode drills right into the minds of the EVA pilots. The human instrumentality program. (mentioned in 0:8)its full of surreal images and thoughts and even an alternate reality.It reminds me of an old SNES game called terranigma. The plot is so twisted doctors are going to write philosophy books on it! (check them out in amazon.com)"
2,not the best episodes,"apart from the -could have been possible-other version of reality, 2 episodes to watch before a philosophie test, no more. But it really makes you long for the other 25 episodes"
2,/This/ is how it ends!,"The night after I watched this I had bizarre nightmares about having my brain melted, and I think this might be why. It's a really disappointing ending to an otherwise amasing series--fortunately all is not lost, because the creators knew that, and went on to make 'The End of Evangelion' movie, which sums everything up and finishes off the series for us. :)"
4,You thought this was the real ending didn't you?,"Well I watched all 13 hours of the Evangelion series. I got the 13th tape expecting to see the third impact. Well, no. You don't see the third impact par say, you see the result as Shinji decides that he would rather be happy than sad in his new reality. If you want to see the ""real"" ending, then you have to struggle to find the movie ""End of Evangelion"" like I did."
5,0:13,"You may think that it will anwser all of your questions unfortunaly it dosen't. Eventhough you can see rei with some emotion. Heres something that will some it up He who overcomes will be dressed in white,and I will not take his name from the book of life;and I will give witness to his name befor my Father ,and befor his angles. -Revelations 3:5"
1,Not what I exspected from EVA.......,"Ok,the series was great no doubt about that but this video...well lets just say it wasent entertaining at all..They could have made it much better but all it seemed to be was Shinji in a chair lots of flashbacks and talking.Its not really the end..and it makes you want to see more but this was such a disapointment to me..I returned it back to the store.Itll be good to see just for the sake of seeing it but not worth $30!Sorry but the onley reason this got a star is becuase it was the subtitled Japanese verion and the last 5 mins was cool.Well thats all I have to say..sorry.... (It also make you wonder if the creator had any mentle problems)"
2,12 excelent videos ruined by the end.,"It has been said that a good story teller doesn't tell you a story, but insteads allows you to find out about the story yourself through clues and other hints. That is what has made the first twelve videos so extraordinary and that is what loses me on the last one.The instramentality project as Singe accepting that he has more worth then he thinks he does. Geesh I would hope that the world has not been spending countless dollars and man hours on a project that allows people to figure out something that they would eventually figure out themselfs..Sorry guys the movie ending makes much more sense to me."
2,Disappointing,"I LOVED the Eva series!!!. They had evrything!!. Action, mechs, love, a very intriguing storyline..but then it came Genesis 13. What a disappointing finale to such a great series!!. I was very ansious for this video to arrive. I mean, Genesis 12 leaved you wanting more!. It was boring. No wonder Gainax had to make 3 more movies to calm down the japanese fans!!. Buy it just for having the entire collection. But if you're not an Eva fan, just don't bother."
4,WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!,"OK, listen, I'm appalled that anyone could giv this movie anything lower than a 4! The only reason that I gave this a 4 is that it's dubbed, and dubbed is some harsh stuff when it comes to anime. Anyway, admittedly this is a weird tape, but COME ON, the whole series is weird. That's part of the point! Anyway, if you're sooooooo completely confused by this tape, then wait for ""The End of Evangelion"" to be released in America (unless you can speak Japanese). That will explain everything. That's the other part of the point. This series was designed so that you could see just about everything relatively consecutively. So just wait. I've seen the End of Evangelion, and let me tell you now, it's some great stuff. Not for kids, but it's dam cool!"
2,Well...,"I honestly don't think the episodes should all be rated individually but I do think that this final episode (or at least the last of the ADV published NGE videos) was terrible! It was probably the worst conclusion to a great anime series that I could have expected. What you see on the cover of the box is about all there is to it inside. Basically the main characters are interviewed and they see what ""could"" have happened as an ending. It was full of ""Everybody hates me!"" being every other sentence out of the character's mouths... and compared to the rest of the series this was just a very poor episode. No real action or even continuation of the story, if Genesis 13 was never published, nobody would even miss it.I'm eagerly awaiting more from Manga Entertainment which is the publisher behind the upcoming Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Movie..."
5,The worthy conclusion to a great human drama,"Let me just say that I don't think viewers should be evaluating episodes 25 & 26 and 25' & 26' (End of Evangelion) independently. They're linked-- neither gives you the complete picture. End concludes and answers questions about the bigger picture (about what happens to the world), but 25 & 26 conclude the micro, the resolution of many of Shinji's psychological troubles. 25 and 26 give significance to the events of 25' and 26', but without watching (and understanding) 25' and 26', you probably won't understand what makes 25 & 26 significant.In short, if you're going to watch 25 & 26, watch End-- and vice versa. They are not alternatives, but are synergistically complementary (if that makes any sense)."
2,"Sparkles in places, but ultimately misses the mark","While Gale demonstrates considerable writing talent, he's unable to sustain the pace for more than a few pages at a time. The hapless hero is unconvincing - one moment all rugged virility, the next a wimpering wuss - and the dialog is often dreadful. As for the implausible plot twists noted by other reviewers, either you accept them as essential to the fable-like atmosphere of the book, or you regret that Gale finally resorts to a sitcom story line to pull it all together. But despite all its failings, I can't help but give Gale at least two stars for some writing that's good enough to keep me on his side - hoping in vain that in the end he'll really pull it off. Unfortunately, he doesn't."
4,Tales of the Unexpected ...,"Gale carves up the Family Tree & puts it back together in ways that surprise to the last page. Much of this is achieved by exploiting the reader's prejudice about birth order & family relationships. Like mental judo, he probes for a weakness - and will throw you before you know it.If it seems improbable - it is!! If you're able to laugh at your own prejudice, you'll like this ... and it's great for existing fans of teasy, clever Gale.* OnlyMe reviews from an Only-Child point of view."
4,Entertaining,"This is a fun, campy musical...it makes the house of ill repute seem almost wholesome! Always good for a laugh."
4,Dolly never lets you down!,"Basically, for me, Dolly Parton was the best part of watching this movie. Of course, she's wearing her cleavage-baring dresses and big hair. She and Burt Reynolds have a great, ""Love 'em, hate 'em"" relationship, and they can scream at eachother really well. The songs are catchy enough to where you flip around for the songs just to watch them over and over again. At any rate, not the best movie, but Dolly makes it GRRREAT!"
3,Come on it was fun,"I can understand all of the comments about this movie being mediocre. But come on can you honestly say that when you picked the Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, you were expecting say An American in Paris. I was satisifed. It was a nice way to waste an afternoon. My only complaint would be Burt Reynolds was in the majority of the movie and this explains why the movie comes across as slow. Another actor should have been chosen. What gives this movie three stars is Dolly Parton. She was adorable in it and had such charisma. The governor's number is a must also."
1,Best little hothouse in texas,DVD only works on computers not on regular DVD player or Xbox or ps3 Big time drag watching a movie on a laptop
5,Good clean comedy,"Comedy, romance, drama and a little musical all in one, I'm so glad I bought this. great entertainment for mature audiences."
5,momof2,This movie is a fun movie and it's nice to get the old movies on DVD to share with your family.
5,Plain Truth,"WOW & WOW again. I love musicals, & I love Dolly and Burt. Together they are dynamite. It's interestin how Dolly took on the character of the real madame. The music, the costomes, the entire movie was very entertaining.I thought the language was a bit rough, but then again it was not a movie for the faint of heart or children"
1,Bummer!,"While I am sure this was not the seller's fault, the dvd did not work. The screen kept freezing and it could notbe watched. We tried it on both of our dvd players to no avail. This was a bummer because we had guestsover on new years night and were going to watch it then. Again, these things happen and I will be returningit."
1,bad video,Could not watch this video because it said out of region. Didn't know you had regions where videos are blocked
3,"It was good, but...","The movie wasn't as good as the play, but was OK. I think the entire movie would have been better if they had used a different actor for Ed Earl."
5,Christmas present for my daughter...,"I saw this movie years ago & it was ok, but my daughter LOVES it!!! The movie contains one of my favorite ""Dolly"" songs ""Hard Candy Christmas"". My daughter had said several times how much she loved this movie & wanted to get it so when I saw it on Amazon, I bought it & had it sent to her (out of state). She was so happy & excited to receive it in the mail. Delivery was fast & she's satisfied! If you love Dolly then I'm sure you'll like this movie."
5,The best little movie I ever saw,"This has to be one of the best musicals of all time, and certainly the most underrated. Well-cast and well-acted, and with great song and dance routines, comedy, heartache and tension, it really is a must-see movie. Burt and Dolly are absolutely brilliant as Sheriff Ed Earl and Miss Mona, equalled only by Charles Durning and his amazing twisting cowboy hat, and well supported by the Chicken Ranch girls. Get your hanky ready for the tearful moments, and prepare to smile your way through the joy - and just make sure you dance the Sidestep too!"
4,Entertaining,This movie is a timeless statement of the stupidity of human nature and the nature of Government Representatives. Some so-called 'doooo-gooder'decides that the house of pleasure must be closed and brings it to the attention of a nation. The Establishment has only been in existence for a hundred years and locals are gobstopped that there a 'whorehouse' in their town. Well hush my mouth!!!Dolly Parton fans will love this movie - the part was made for her and she was gorgeous in it.
3,Fun,This is a good movie but you don't want to watch it a lot. Dolly Parton does her role very well.
5,Love this movie!,"This is an absolute musical classic. A must see for any fan of Dolly Parton or musicals in general. This is where the famous ""I will always love you"" song got started."
4,Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton light up the screen!,I liked this a lot because it's a cute story and I'm a big fan of Burt Reynolds and musicals!
5,wonderful,"I had this movie in VHS and decided it was time to get it in DVD. I love this movie and have watched it at least a dozen times in the last few months. The music is good and the dancing is fun to watch. This is not a family movie because of the language and nudity, but it is great for adults."
2,Another Missed Opportunity,"I enjoyed this film and its musical numbers.However (as always) DVD buyers may have too many expectations of the studio when it chooses to issue one their pictures to DVD.Universal could have restored the late Colin Higgins' film to his original cut that had unedited lyrics and extended musical numbers like the ""Aggie Song"" (that were filmed and in the original work prints, as well as on the soundtrack).At least these extras could have been offered under ""Bonus Material"" without changing the sanctity of the existing film.After all, the film is rated [R] and, 21 years later, could hardly be deemed offensive.The ""Making of..."" feature is just over 7 minutes and offers little more than principal's interviews.The only true benefit of this transfer is that it can be viewed in widescreen format."
1,Dissatisfied,The DVD was only for a specific region and would not play for us - luckily my daughter has an Apple laptop that we were able to watch it but unfortunately off her tiny screen.A complete disappointment
3,"If you like Dolly's chest, you'll like this!","Although the movie has a pretty cheesy plot as well as acting, there are some fabulous cleavage shots of Dolly! I've searched high and low for movies featuring naked Dolly, but they just don't exist. So you'll have to settle for this! Please Dolly, you got some of the most beautiful bazoombas in Hollywood. Share 'em with us!"
1,Misleading title and description,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I am not such a dyed-in-the-wool Denver fan that I take this book's shortcomings personally. For what it is, it's fine. But this is NOT a biography. It's more like a college term paper. The author conducts a 175 page music review, focusing on quotes from others, articles in music magazines, and demographic data available to anyone. It is misrepresented as a biography. There is almost no information here about the man or his personal or inner life, his relationships with others, his struggles or victories. It was SO BORING and superficial; a 5 page magazine article could have done the same thing and done it more effectively. A total waste of paper."
1,All About Collis,I was vastly disappointed in this book. It would only rate a C as a freshman term paper. Collis mostly writes his gut level reaction to Denver's songs and the cultural events of the fifties through nineties with absolutely no attempt to analyze or substantiate. Why on a book about Denver do we have a page and a half about Rosa Parks? Was Denver there with her on the bus? One would find more content on Denver's life in a People Magazine article.
1,Useless and self-absorbed,"It is clear that this author wasn't all that interested in John Denver, with so many meaningless tangents and so little new information. He doesn't add to our knowledge or insights about John Denver, and his treatment of John's personal life was superficial and indicated no research with people who actually knew him. His ""analysis"" of John's psychological state was speculative and lazy. You could find everything he had to say on a web site somewhere. And his snarky musical criticism was just irritating. Don't waste your money."
1,Less than one star,Do not expect to find much out about John Denver in this book. The author should stick to a subject he likes instead of someone he so obviously doesn't. Fan or not this book is beyond boring and uninformative when it comes to his main subject. I think I learned more about the Byrds in this book than I did about John Denver. The book is also filled with assumptions that have no basis and musical snobbery that is very tiring.
4,Potent Humor,"Dropped on an unsuspecting public, Viagra, the little blue pill that can, has done wonders for (a) the love lives of elderly men, (b) Pfizer Corp. stock and (c) the bad-joke industry. Now, in the second wave of Viagra humor, comes a hilariously clever book that addresses issues we thought we'd never have to ponder, like what to do in the case of a Viagra overdose, the effects of Viagra on pets and how to fill your prescription without the whole town knowing.Eisenberg, an editor for creative development at TIME, and McCall, whose humor has brightened the pages of The New Yorker, took only two months to crank out this amusing gem. Give it to a male friend who's having a significant birthday."
2,viagra what?,"found most of this material to be on the dry dull humor side. Some interesting insight, but otherwise I would of waitied till the book ended up in the local goodwilll store."
4,Flying Tigers as seen by Radioman Smith,"This is a somewhat edited version of Robert M. Smith's diary that he kept during his year with the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers). Smith attended college before joining the Army, rather unusual for the time. He joined the AVG for adventure, like most of the pilots and technicians. And he kept a diary, as many of them did.Smith's diary is especially insightful, and I used it a lot when I was writing my history of the Flying Tigers. He has a good eye for geography; I especially liked his account of driving up the Burma Road to the AVG's home base in Kunming.I own the paperback; it was chock-a-block with photos, which I assume are included in the Schiffer edition. Good reading for all Flying Tigers buffs."
2,Most of the information is available at docs.sun.com,"This is not a bad book, but it is redundant when you have your trusty man pages and online documentation at docs.sun.com. I recommend the Solaris 8 System Administrator's guide Vol 1-3 at docs.sun.com for a cheaper alternative."
1,written for wankers,"This book sucks. I get more and more disgusted as the pages turn. It covers NO (read: none, zero, zed, zilch) advanced topics (LDAP, installation, mail subsystem, diskless operation, NIS(+) initial setup, routing protocols, firewalling, routing, X11 setup, xdm, IPsec, RADIUS, AMD, Kerberos, SNMP, performance tuning, kernel details, etc.).Most of the book doesn't even cover solaris specific stuff; it is mainly vanilla UNIX, OS agnostic (like shells, environments, lp, SVR4 stuff). It should be callled ""using AdminTool to get your workstation on the network and how to do your day to day tasks.""I know UNIX well (Linux, *BSD, etc.) but not Solaris 8 and wanted a reference for all the quirks of Solaris. This book was a complete waste of time. Do not buy this book unless you are a novice and haven't figured out how to use man pages."
2,Should be called man-pages-plus,"While the info in this book is clear and correct, it really is just an enhancement of the info found in the man pages. I suppose that its best purpose is as a desk reference utilized when you would like to see better versions of man pages in printed format."
3,"Nice size, just adequate sound quality","The backlighting is nice and it's nice that the phone tells you when an extension is in use. What's annoying about the phone is you have to go through menus to get to the memory feature, so it actually takes more button presses than dialing the number itself (still handy if you forget phone numbers). One thing that really disappointed me is that the sound is interrupted during conversations every so often, just for a split second. I expected better from a digital 900MHz phone. decent range though, and its small size is a plus. I had no problems with the headset- it's surprisingly comfortable."
3,Useful but could be better,"This phone is both small and lightweight, which is the only reason we bought it. I find both the menu-ing and even basic operation of the phone a bit confusing. No intercom or handset to base paging. Base to handset paging almost useless to locate a lost handset because it only rings once and rather quietly. Battery lasts several days although not as long as some. Fine phone if you need something that slips in your pocket or clips to your belt. Wish there were more small ones to choose from. Geeze, most cellular phones are smaller than most cordless phones!"
5,The greatest little phone,"I really like this phone. It is very compact, light, and has great reception. The included headset is very useful when you want to talk on the phone and do stuff around the house. The headset has great sound and reception as well. Deffinetely the best phone I ever bought for the money."
3,standard V-tech problem,"a cute very compact phone; sacrifice of direct buttons like redial is worth it. headset excellent: a great feature. clarity is quite good, given that it is not dss. back-up battery is a terrific feature, especially in rural areas where power outages are common. one big problem as with other V-tech phones I have had: channel search operations can interrupt conversation periodically or even lose a caller at the beginning while you are unable to answer. Despite other reviews, mine had a belt clip, but I dropped it anyway. Will not replace it because of the way channel-search works on this phone."
1,not very good reception,"this is the 2nd phone had to send the first one back, lots of static and cuts in and out in the middle of a conversation. planning on sending this one back also."
2,"It's okay, I guess.....but I've had better phones.","The phone and the functions aren't bad at all but god forbid if you should need to find a battery for this thing. I've been to where I originally bought this thing and every other store in my city but not only do they not carry the original phone itself, but no accessories to go with it either. It sort of makes me ponder as to why I actually got this thing in the 1st place."
1,Headset faulty,Loved the size...but the headset would only work if it was placed just perfectly...and of course don't move at all once it's in. Sound quality wasn't as good as I expected from the handset. Going to have to take it back.
4,great stuff,"I simply do not understand why more comic fans do not have this work in their personal collections. Frank Miller is a comic legend. Walt Simonson is a respected visionary as well. I think any collaboration between the two would be reason enough to buy this book. Are people put off just because they chose to work on a topic as fun as a meeting between Robocop and some Terminators?This comic is downright entertaining. Miller's storyline includes all the essentials of a good Robocop and a good Terminator tale. Of course, he also adds some new characters and twists. The storyline is smooth and not forced, unlike a huge number of crossover tales out there. Both Robocop and the Terminator can be difficult to draw, but Simonson is more than up to the task. His visions of the future are well-thought out and executed.This is a good book. Try it."
2,"Oh, yuk!","Just more dumb crock-pot recipes that rely on one packaged product after another being dumped in. Why would I want to use a whole bottle of BBQ sauce in a recipe?Where is the book that uses fresh ingredients, mixed together in a sensible (and maybe slightly creative??) way, simmers them together in the crock pot during the course of the day, resulting in an easy - and HEALTHY - meal? This book is NOT it!"
3,Not many interesting recipes,"I want a slow cooker cook book for main course recipes, this book emphasizes side dishes, desserts, etc. and has few main course recipes that interest me. Some of the ones I looked at said to cook 9 hours on high which doesn't make sense, based on my experience with crock pots, but I did not try them so can't say if the advice is wrong. I purchased used, cheaply, but would NOT pay full price for it."
3,Not well thought out,"Although the recipes are lovely, too many of them (at least half!) have cooking times of 4 or 5 hours. So for the wonderful breakfast casserole, I'm supposed to get up at 4 a.m. to put it together for breakfast at 8? What were they possibly thinking? And I'm also supposed to run home from work at 2 p.m. to put dinner on for 6 p.m. that night? Huh? Maybe these recipes are supposed to appeal to folks who don't have jobs, and are free to start the meal at anytime (althought the 4 a.m. breakfast recipe still puzzles me). But are they really the folks who use slow cookers? Most of us want recipes that cook for at least 8 hours, so that we can put them on before we go to work and have them ready and waiting when we get home. Maybe someone at Southern Cooking needs a reality check."
2,Tons of Processed Ingredients & Sugar,"Although this book has a great variety of recipes that look family friendly, I was very disappointed to find that most of them include highly processed ingredients as key factors of the recipes: Smucker's caramel sauce, Russian dressing, American cheese, Coffeemate imitation creamer. Recipes also tended to be high in sugar content.I'm pretty good at adapting recipes to accommodate my household's sugar limits and off-limits processed food restriction, but these recipes were so heavily based on those ingredients that they're almost all useless to me."
3,I was a bit disappointed,"I have been searching for a great slow cooker cookbook....my husband loves slow cooked foods- I am not as big of a fan as he is. I have a few tried & true recipes, but I was hoping that a SouthernLiving cookbook was my answer. I have made a few recipes out of this book & so far they have all been ok...but I really wanted something amazing...which is what I usually get from SouthernLiving. I will keep trying out recipes to see if maybe I just picked out the boring ones...but I have a feeling my quest for the perfect slow cooker cook book has not ended."
5,one of the best,"One of the best slow cooker recipe books! I use this all the time! The Thai style ribs (front cover) are amazing, and there are some really amazing recipies in here. Very simple cooking, with lots of main dishes, appetizers, light eating, side dishes and just some all around classic recipes. I may order a 2nd copy because mine is so worn. Buy this book!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I bought a nice Kitchen Aid slow cooker...saw this book thinking I'd get a lot of good ideas and recipes...it's all ""fluff"" so to speak. It's more like a coffee table book than a cookbook! Don't Buy This! (I'm betting if you do, you'll regret it!)"
4,Does the job but keep an eye on the screws,"I have used this to make about twenty cuts of PT 2x4 and 2x6 decking on a concrete slab, flush with the house wall. It seems to work fine, but the two recessed screws came loose and I used high strength locktite on them to prevent it happening again. Also the other three blade mount and positioning screws loosened. I was lucky to catch this or it would have self destructed. I was using a Sawzall Hatchet power saw. I kept the saw away from the slab by stopping at 1/16 inch to go and snapping the wood with a kick, so contact with concrete was not the cause of the screws coming loose. Screws stay tight 95% of the time, just keep an eye on it."
3,Kind of works,"I bought this item for a particular purpose - To cut out plywood as close to a corner of a wall as possible. It can do it but with a lot of work. You are still going to have a 1/8"" to a 1/4"" remainder to deal with. I am sure I was pushing its limitations as I couldn't find another tool to help me with a very difficult rehab job. Taking a house apart from the inside without using a bulldozer or a sledge hammer can make things very difficult. I found that the extension of any blade that you tend to use in a reciprocating saw makes for a lot of wobble which in effect rendered the tool useless for all but the sharpest (and straightest) of blades. If you have a few small nails in odd spots to cut off - this is the tool. For any long cutting jobs 8' and over - just use a sledge hammer...or bulldozer - it's quicker to wreck and rebuild."
4,A great beginning for slobberbone,"I'm pretty new to these guys, although i do have their four releases. Apparently this album was realeased back in the day as an demo ep for slobberbone, but regardless its a very good cd. The influeces of punk and country really standout as does Brent Best's abilty to write great, humorous, heartfelt songs about drinkin, failed romance and the like. This disc is an essential for any fan of slobberbone."
5,The Pictorial history of Westminster Abbey,I inadvertently left this item in a store while shopping so was very glad to be able to purchase this item to go with others in the series.
5,Bravo!,This product arrived promtly and efficiently. I will use this product again when I need to reorder in the future.
5,A lot quicker to clean!,I bought the larger swiffer for dusting in the store and now I can't find the X-Large sweeping cloths anywhere but online. I was happy to find them here. Received them quickly and the bulk rate prevents me from having to buy too often. Exactly what I needed.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,Recieved an old bottle that containes BPA!! Very disappointed and do not trust this seller!!! Avent has not made those bottles in a very long time. $13 for 1 bottle containing BPA-what a deal!!
5,THE ANTIOXIDANT BIBLE,"This book is all you need, if you want to know the importance of antioxidants. It clearly explains the four most important ones, after you've read this, you will always take them for the rest of your life. There is an instruction to mix your personal cocktail depending on your needs. Extremely helpful the chapter about using antioxidant cremes for your skin - it really works!"
4,Informative and interesting to read-a miracle???,"It was an informative read for someone new to the ""miracle"" of anti-oxidants. Not sure my specialist would encourage such reading; however it explained things in a logical and understandable way. I cannot comment from a scientific view; but it does convincingly put across another belief that is backed up by evidence. It is well explained. Time will tell!"
3,Book was very used!,"The book itself is very good and well written. The condition of the book was very used, don't mind the highlights and notes from past user, but the torn pages was another issue.Pleased on how fast it was deliver!"
1,"If you look for a fact book, look at the miracle!","Usually miracles don't happen in science. Even if one is enthusiastic about a certain topic, an author writing about a scientific subject would rarely use such an expression. I agree, that this book is well written - if you look for a book on selling the self. ""Packer"" is probably the most used word is this text, topped only by ""is"", ""the"", etc."
3,the antioxidant miracle,"everything concerning the mecanisms of the antioxidants that are shown in this book is just superb and correct, and also the principle that explaning the team work of the antioxidants together.i dont agree at all with the author about the doses that he recommad in the book, because my expirience as an orthomolecularist convinced me that higher doses of the antioxidants should be taken, especialy in the cases of degenerative-oxidative-diseases,(such as:parkinson, altzheimer, huntington,multiple-sclerosis,etc...).it is very much worth to read this book, and is very informative in the sence of molecular-chemistry,and the molecular way of the antioxidants,but again, the doses should be much higher."
5,Changed My Life,"I first read this book six years ago and have been following the Antioxidant Daily Cocktail since then.I bought it again in Sept. 2007 to review its suggestions.I'm 69 years old and have no aches and pains of any sort and attribute it to this book. Recently had a heart scan and no plaque was found - a ""0"" reading which is unusual for a person of my age."
5,Antioxidants,"This is one of the best books I have ever read on Antioxidants and how important they are to combat cancer and other diseases. Everyone should have this book handy for reference in the foods they need to eat for great antioxidant protection. I was diagnosed with skin cancer and because I also have Lupus (and a very low immune system), I chose not to take the chemotherapy cream the doctor recommended and decided to use God's healing foods (antioxidants) to fight the cancer cells. My skin cancer is slowly, but surely clearing up and going away."
4,Excellent text for a working Process Engineer,"As a Process Engineer, working in both operations and design in the upstream oil industry, it is pleasing to find a text that finally covers all the unit operations you are likely to encounter in oil processing. The book is an easy read that doesn't get weighed down in first principles. This means that you can quickly get the information you require and have confidence in your decisions. It's a must for anyone working in the industry, especially those who may be offshore, I always have my copy with me."
4,Good Two CD program,"Though there are many recordings of all these works by now, this has stood the test of time well. Recorded sound is good.Groves may be a less often mentioned name among British conductors of Sibelius, but these are worth the effort for the Sibelius collector.The only problem might be availability. If you want the symphonies and tone poems all in one box, they can be obtained quite cheaply and in decent recordings.I enjoyed the two discs, played back to back. LemminkÃ¤inen suite is perfect."
4,"A nicely written, engaging military sci-fi piece.","Not much to add to other reviews here, except for a little FYI: despite the cryptic pseudonim, ""Ian Douglas"" is identified as a certain William H. Keith (""Warstrider"" and others) by the copyright. It actually sort of makes sense in retrospect as the young Marine hero of this novel, Jack Ramsey bears a certain similarity to the protagonist of the Warstrider series. Not a clone by any means, but some stylistic similarities in the character sketch are definitely there."
3,"Not high art, but worth the afternoon spent reading it.","In his second installment, Douglas does a nice job of telling a roaring space opera story. The plot is interesting, and so are the characters (if a little one dimensional). The only real criticism I have is that Douglas didn't seem to spend more than five minutes on his Marine Corps research. I realize that this is probably sour grapes, but having spent eight years as an enlisted Marine Corps Infantryman, I would sort of like to see a little accuracy (at least in tems of uniforms, Marine protocol etc...). Davis, in this book as well as the last, seems to have gotten his behvior/speech models for the Marines, both officers and enlisted, from a really bad movie or comic book.All criticisms aside, I enjoyed it. You will too if you like military science fiction."
4,MORE GOOD IAN DOUGLAS,"Not stellar, but a good read. Your good basic Star Marine Battle story. Worth a read if you have nothing elso on your plate."
3,Good sci-fi - not great - but good,"Ian Douglas is a good writer. He is Marine-centric and seems to feel there is little use for other services - not too much of a problem with that, but it leaves something to be desired.His writing is decent and he kept me interested enough to read the trilogy. As I got through it all, I found that his push against the indomitable foe got a little far fetched. The character development also began to lag a bit as things went along. Overall, not bad sci-fi and it remained interesting enough."
1,No map,"Though the description says it includes a Map of the World, this version, sadly, does not.This is a bitter disappointment."
1,Do not waste your money,"Do not waste your money. This Lampoon collection is so bad it is hard to define. A page or two of humor surrounded by pages of wasted time. Lampoon pretends to be high-intellect humor, but this stuff just comes off mean and stupid, with emphasis on stupid."
2,stiff keys and inconsistent action,"This _could_ be a great keyboard, but after only one day with it I couldn't go on using it. It is possible to adjust it so that your hands are in a very comfortable position. The problem is that the action on the right side of the keyboard is terrible - the keys require _way_ too much travel to activate, and the action on the right side is much, much too stiff. Not only is there too much travel for each key, unless the keys are pressed down at an angle exactly pependicular to the keyboard, they won't go down. So my hands ended up more tired than they would have been on my old keyboard. I had to return it."
3,Not as good as the previous version,"I bought this to replace an 8 year old Goldtouch keyboard that had broken (the pivot between the two halves of the keyboard broke...that's the weak point of the mechanical design of this item). So reliability is not a big issue. However, key placement is.The Home key is now right next to the Back Space key on the upper right side; it wasn't before...I keep hitting Home when I intend to hit Back Space. Also, the location of the Delete key was moved, along with a rearrangement of all the other left-side keys. Control-alt-delete is no longer a strain-free motion with one hand...bad design (especially for Windoze users that need to use that particular set of keys...).Overall it's the best thing on the market for relief of strain during typing, but the previous key layout was far superior to the current layout."
2,Breaks within a year,"I've bought two Goldtouch keyboards. I love them but they break. The handle to adjust the keyboard has broken on BOTH of my keyboards within a year even though I NEVER adjust them (I set them once and let them but the bar STILL broke! WTF!) For the price, this is unacceptable."
3,Keys are very small,"Not really happy with this. I would say find one and test it before you buy. Quality is Great, but the keys are very small and a few keys are in crazy places and may just drive you crazy.I tried mapping the ""crazy keys"" to different places and disabled a few others and really nothing helped.Keys to worry about: Home, Caps Lock, Shift (right hand)"
5,Great product again and excellent customer service,"I wrote a review earlier about the new model (GTU-077) versus the older model (KFK-E87YB). The new model had some initial production problems of stiffer key pressure and loose contact with some right hand keys.Customer service was proactive in contacting me and letting me know that they had fixed those problems. They even sent me a fixed keyboard. That was above and beyond customer service expectations!The fixed keyboard GTU-077 is a joy to use again. The key pressure is back to normal. I am recovering from repetitive stress injury (RSI) due to typing. I put the keyboard on my lap in the shape of a flat tent, which really helped alleviate my RSI pain immediately.One minor nit: I do prefer the key placement of the previous model (ESC not connected to the row of Function keys). However, I did get used to the placement and it does not detract from the overall benefits of use.Excellent keyboard!"
2,Great Ergo Keyboard! Too Bad Not All the Keys Work!,"""I ordered and received the keyboard in a timely manner. In fact, after one day of use, my wrists and hands stop aching, so much that I could now discard the Boba Fett wrist guards that I've been using. Why only 2 stars instead of 5? Well, the DELETE key in the upper right corner doesn't work. Thankfully there is another DELETE key on the left side, but still, for $ 150 everthing should work. Ah well."
1,Poorly Designed,"Though it says it's for MAC, it was clearly designed by PC thinking people. My first horror was to discover that it does NOT have a USB port for the mouse on the keyboard itself. As the MAC only has 3 USB ports, my hub is full and I don't need one more thing to plug into it.Secondly, it doesn't sit upright as shown. It adjusts awkwardly and sits flat. Beware also, Goldtouch's RMA form states: A 15% restocking fee will apply to unopened product. A 50% restocking fee will apply to openedproduct. I don't know how they expect you to know if you'll like it by looking at the box.Pass on this one."
4,Glenn's Urology,"I found Glenn's Urology to be very easily read with a thorough coverage of the most common and essential Urologic procedures, their alternatives with the full operative technique, a literature review on the outcomes, complications, etc. There are some minor typos though. Overall, it's a very useful companion for any Urology Resident."
5,High Altitude Crankshaft Position Sensor,This sensor provides an additional 5* of base timing advance. It's recommended for high altitudes but can provide a few hp and better mpg at lower altitudes provided you use higher octane gas. Good ole Jeep tricks.
4,"Blu-ray nicely mastered, both image and audio, but revealing of deficiencies in the original negative.","An image so vivid that unlike any previous blu-ray I have purchased to date, I had to dumb-down my monitor from ""vivid"" to ""standard"" to compensate, which is a good thing as the reduction in contrast subdues the occasional film grain which is evident quite often but short-lived, such as when Director Rush presumably zoomed in on the film negative for a close-up in post-production as an afterthought rather than having done so 'in camera' during the shoot. Though the original mix was mono, discrete surround sounds are quite evident from time to time. After enduring the poor print quality of the laserdisc pressing it's good to see Rush's beloved film get its due on blu-ray, both of which are well worth the upgrade if you're a big fan like myself, but if you're not and already have the two-disc Limited Edition, you won't find enough of a difference to warrant this upgrade to blu-ray."
3,For O'Toole fans only,"Confusing, pretentious, self-indulgent, engaging and boring alternately, thought-provoking in a shallow do-your-own-thing sort of way, and a waste of time except for O'Toole fans. It is very much his movie, for better and worse."
3,Foundations in Microbiology Basic Principles 7th Ed. International Student Edition,"My rating of the item is specifically for the item. The seller was great. The International edition is a good book for my class but being that I thought it was the same as the original hardbound book, I was disappointed. The International Student Edition is missing 10 full chapters from the original, giving it only 17 Chapters rather than the full 27. Still a good book."
1,CHAPTERS ARE MISSING!!!!!,This book is missing some chapters... I wish I had known before I got to the end of my course....
1,Rip off,I bought this book for college Microbiology. It was a decent price but when I went to my first class the professor had us check to see if we had all the chapters. This book does NOT!!! It's missing 9 chapters! So if you need them I would not get this book.
2,Dissatisfied,"Even though I ordered the correct item, I was shippped and Received a Student Intl copy that i did not order. The store sent a letter stating the item was the same as the domestic copy however it wasnt . I returned this item on 8/23 and as of 9/6 still have not been reimbursed for the return."
1,Book for college class.,I didn't receive my book in the mail and it has been 30 days. I don't know what happened. I don't have a book for the class I ordered it for and am borrowing one till I get mine. I am wandering if it will ever get here.
3,Misled,The condition of the book was fine. However I didn't realize until I got the book that it did not contain all the chapters that the hard back copy did.
5,Awesome price!!,I bought this paperback version from Amazon for a very cheap price. The other version we used in class was ~$160.00 new!!! I bought this older version for like $40-50.00 and just copied the rest of the pages from the updated library version of the last two chapters covered in the final test. I actually found the CD included with the book on Amazon as wellthe for dirt cheap!! Keep up the good work Amazon!!
1,seller doesn't know what's goin on,"had trouble with seller. email her several times and never got back to me. when she finally did. she said she was not aware of the ""sale"" so i went ahead and ordered another book elsewhere and asked seller for a refund. She said ""NO... she already sent it out."" but how can u send a product out if you haven't even got paid and know nothing about it? recived book from seller... didn't open it and returned book to seller."
5,Micro on time,I got my book in a very timely manner. I was very pleased with the condition and the delivery time. Will surely buy again.
1,Wrong Item,"This seller Also goes under the NAME ABCTOY4me, The item listed advertised 1ST EDITION CARDS booster packs. 5 Orders placed and only 3 packs of 25 were in fact 1ST EDITION."
5,they work great,"I never thought I'd order brake rotors on Amazon, but I did, and delivery was even faster than on books!It was the first time I recall having a problem with a shipment though. One of the rotors was defective, damaged right through the box, so we suspect it came from the factory that way and it wasn't caught in the warehouse. Contacted Amazon, replacement was dispatched the same day and we sent back the defective one. We were a little disappointed to have to wait on the installation, but the two rotors went on a few days later, and I haven't heard a squeak of complaint from either of them. These are beautiful, solid rotors to behold and they have since driven across the country and halfway down the east coast. They're good."
3,tough but fair,"i did the whole book, and i just took the boards. the questions in this book certainly are nothing like the board questions; they are much more difficult. however, it is a good review of the topics, and i rather do tough questions, and learn from them, than easy ones that only review what you already know. don't be discouraged if you get the questions wrong, just learn from them. there are MANY questions that test material that is trully not relevant to the boards, and that is a significant problem with the book."
4,board review,"Good review material. I prefer questions and answers for review rather than just notes and so this works best for me. However, i would have liked it more if the questions were random and not chapter wise, as that way, its more chanllenging. Overall, a good book."
3,Good supplement,"I like to study with questions to test what I have learned. This book was definitely very helpful with that. But beware that there are incorrect answers. I agree that there are questions that are esoteric but it forces you to overstudy. Plus, it will help with the 2 or 3 random, even-more-esoteric questions on the actual board."
3,Good bibliographic library,"I have used Procite for over 15 years, and maintain a technical bibliography of over 16,000 entries. Searches are fast and accurate, and entries are easy. I only rate it 3 stars because it connects to Word 2003 with difficulty, and cannot be used with Word 2007. They do not indicate that they will upgrade to full Vista compatibility."
4,Hornblower and the Crisis.,This surprisingly was the first CS Forester 'Hornblower' book that I had read. Historical fiction of the Napoleonic wars I find very enjoyable. It also gives a very good insight into life on a Royal Navy 'man of war' at that time. I have since read all of the Hornblower series I could get may hands on.
3,The Garden of Abdul Gasazi by a kid,"The Garden of Abdul GasaziBy Chris Van Allsburgreviewed by a kidHave you ever seen a dog turn into a duck? In The Garden of Abdul Gasazi by Chris Van Allsburg, Alan and Fritz go into the garden of Abdul Gasazi. Alan lost Fritz in the garden owned by Mr.Gasazi, so he turned him into a duck. I like this book because it has a mysterious Ending. My favorite part is the end because it's unknown what happened to Fritz. This book reminds me of when I went to the Botanic Gardens because it was a field trip like maybe Fritz thought it was a field trip to him.I recommend this book to people who like magic because a man turns a dog into a duck."
4,Be zapped away by the magic of this book!,This is a book that has black and white drawings. I liked it because I got to imagine what the characters looked like and what the colors are. I would recommend this book to others because it is adventures and very well written. The book left me thinking about how the dog got Allen's cap? How did it get there? How did the dog get there so fast? So go read the book and find out.
2,Good,I liked this story. The storyline is simple but the pictures lead you to ponder on the story afterwards a little more.
5,Did Fritz really get changed into a duck?,"This children's book is about a dog named Fritz who runs off from the boy who is watching over him. The dog enters the garden of a retired magician who hates dogs. Yet, the boy has to get the dog back. Alan is shocked to discover that the dog may have been turned into a duck. The book was a 1980 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. A book greatly enjoyed by children of all ages."
2,disappointed,"I bought this product because I love the gel so much, but this nightime ointment sucks. I saw several other generic formulas at walmart that had the same ingredeients for less. This product does not feel very refreshing in my eyes and I wish I could return this stuff. Very unatural gunky feeling goop."
5,Absolutely Brilliant in every respect and more relevant now than ever,This is a brilliant analysis of Egypt;s intellectual and political history and is more relevant now than ever. Great for beginners and experts alike.
4,from Routledge,"One of the major puzzles of Western civilization is how early second century Christianity was transformed into a non-Jewish, Gentile religion, when Christianity began as one of many Jewish factions in the diverse Judaism of the period. The author uses theoretical insights from the social sciences to deal with the complex issues raised by the parting of Judaism and Christianity, and the accompanying rise of Christian anti-Semitism in ancient Antioch. While previous attempts to solve this problem have focused mainly on ideology, his study emphasizes the interplay between sociological and ideological elements."
5,Montessori simplified for both parents and children!,"(I think a previous review discussing postcards was intended for another book as it doesn't have anything to do with A Parent's Guide to the Montessori Classroom.)If you're considering a Montessori school for your child, this book will be invaluable. It distills Montessori theory into simple, clear concepts and explains the purpose and use of the unique Montessori materials. Helpful for parents evaluating a school's particular version of Montessori - and children will love looking at the photos in anticipation!"
3,Not good enough...,"Not as user friendly as most Nokia phones.It only works with PC. To Mac owners the USB function is useless.The camera is nice and it is a fine design to look at, but the drawbacks are such that I can only reccomend it for PC owning gadget freaks."
1,Lack of 850 Band -- US Residents Should Avoid This Phone,"I purchased this phone to replace a Sony Ericsson T637. I didn't expect the lack of the 850 band would be a problem, but it was. Apparently there are many, many fewer 850 band radios deployed than 1900. I kept getting ""Emergency Service Only"" warnings even though I was working inside Cingular's Miami, Florida switch. Aside that, the phone is great. I ended up replacing it with a quad band W810i which I don't like nearly as much."
4,A pretty good indie rock album - one of my favorites of 2005!,"This album is one of my favorite indie rock albums of 2005, and although it's not groundbreaking it has a lot of fun and interesting tracks. ""Make Yourself Useless"", ""You Came Crashing"", ""Out Of My Hands"", ""Art Of The Disconnect"", ""Our Only Appeal"" and ""Atmosphere"" are all very catchy tunes which alone make this album a satisfying purchase. The drums especially are interesting in a lot of the songs. Overall it's pretty good, even if you ""could"" do without it. The singer also does a pretty good job, although at times he's a little questionable (mainly just on the first track). The only place that I'm aware of to buy it is at www.cdbaby.com for about $12.00Highlights include:""Make Yourself Useless""""You Came Crashing""""Out Of My Hands""""Art Of The Disconnect""""Our Only Appeal""""Atmosphere"""
1,Warning: bag defects caused leaks and spoiled milk,"I have used the Lansinoh, Medela and First Years bags to store my milk, and these bags leaked my milk twice (out of 5-6 bags we defrosted). We had no problems with the Medela or Lansinoh bags.In the past week alone, I have lost two bags worth of BM after three months storage. After close inspection of these bags, it was clear that in one case, there was a hole/rip in the bottom corner of the bag and in another, the ziploc portion did not seal properly. Both were handled carefully with minimal shaking, contained 180ml of milk, and had been in my freezer for three months.Given the difficulty of pumping BM, I strongly recommend AGAINST using First Years bags."
2,Go with the Lansinoh bags,"These are OK, but the Lansinoh bags are easier to use and write on- and a much better deal!"
1,Horrible Bags!,These bags were horrible!!!! It takes so much work to pump your milk and then it is all wasted because the bags leak! I pumped my entire maternity leave and stored my milk for when I returned to work and now I am loosing all my milk due to these cheap bags! Not worth the money for all the effort!
2,Poor quality,"While the ""easy pour"" feature is nice, the plastic itself is very poor quality. It makes the milk smell plasticy, is fragile and leaks. Also, the area you write on is in the same place the milk is so it makes it hard to write and you also run the risk of puncturing the bag unless you use a permanent marker or something similar. In my opinion, the nice easy pour feature isn't worth wasting the money on the bags. I reccommend Lansinoh brand bags!"
4,They work,"They work, but I found them to be a little bit too wide for the First Years milk storage organizer. I like the Lansinoh bags a lot better."
2,Bag is different than pictured.,"I was highly disappointed. The bags inside are differently printed and MUCH SMALLER than the bag pictured in this ad or even on the package that i received. I use them and like them but only 8 oz will fit and i was planning on putting 10oz in each for easy counting and that would be no problem if the bag looked like the one pictured. Good bag, just don't expect what you see."
3,"Product great, Amazon shipping awful","These are great milk storage bags, just don't buy them from this site. I ordered them and it took over 2 weeks to get them. If you are a breastfeeding mother, you know this is unacceptable. I have been stuck at home with twins, unable to go to the store, and now I'm out of breastmilk storage bags. I've had to store in bottles and borrow containers and bags from friends. Lesson learned."
5,Great fun !,"Although they never really caught on in America other than an occasional appearance on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW,MORCAMBE&WISE were SUPERSTARS in the UK and deservedly so. In this collection Eric and Ernie show off their very funny and considerable song and dance skills. These guys were really talented and Eric Morcambe was a flat out comic genius of timing and mugging. Included are routines with Diana Rigg(!) Vanessa Redgrave,Glenda Jackson,UK pop superstar Cliff Richard and many more. Seeing Dame Diana Rigg in a bawdy song and dance routine with the boys is priceless! They really don't make em' like this anymore and that's too bad but MORCAMBE&WISE live on through collections like this. If you have never seen them check it out."
2,printing on canvas boards pale,This would be a great paint by number kit if one could see the outlines of the picture on each board. It is so light you can hardly see the picture and the numbers for painting the masterpieces are completely unreadable. If anyone else has run across this please let Amazon know so they can fix this problem as I love paint by number kits.I have run across this same problem with the Workman paint by number calendars also and quit buying them.I will have to send this kit back as it is unusable.
2,Paint boards TOO small,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter (who does a lot of paint by numbers). She didn't like this kit because of the size of the paintings.The actual paintings are about 5x7 card size. They are REALLY small. There is no way they can expect you to paint this in a tiny dot so small.It is more advanced (in my opinion) in that you are supposed to use their drawing as guidelines and paint over it how you want. You will never be able to fill in the little sections.
1,Paint by number sadness,"Much to my chagrin, I had to return this item as I could not possibly see the numbers to know what colors to use. I was devasted."
3,Not the best,"I will not recommend this book to someone who wants to learn something, it is very good for practise if really are good at fingerpicking then I would say give it a try but there are so many better books by the same auther!"
1,not impressed,The holes for the bolts were broken the either because the package was open or that it was just poorly made or both. I'm still not clear on how this thing fits into my router. And the this has this yellow hue that is really annoying.
3,Pretty,"They are beautiful, however they fill from a small plug in the bottom. This makes it slightly tricky to fill and nearly impossible to clean. If you live in a high humidity or bug infested area where you are likely to need to clean out your salt and pepper shakers sometimes, then you might want to consider other ones. However, they are lovely to look at."
4,"good book, bad ending","I was asigned at school to read the book ""Izzy Willy-Nilly"". I was surpised to find out that the gripping story of a teenager who made a bad disision, actualy was a very good book. Izzy was 15 and got in a car with a drunk driver. Ultimatly, she looses her leg in the crash. Marco, (the driver and Izzy's date) barley had a bruise. Izzy goes from a popular cheerleader, to a pittied amputie who wants to die.The book is very descriptive and you immediatly fell in love with the characters during the story. Yet such a book as this has to have its down fall, right? Right! The end unfortunatly left nothing explained, like why a misterious girl from school becomes her best friend, or what happed to any of Izzy's friends.Its a good read, and i definatly recomed it. i made a bad dision once and this really helped me think. It gets depressing but it's honestly interesting"
3,I gave this 3 stars...,I gave this book 3 stars because I sort of liked it and then again i sort of didn't. I didn't really like it because it only focused on one thing...her leg! On the other hand though...I liked it because it was really realistic and some parts were funny. All in all... I guess if i had to read this book again I probably would.
4,Izzy Willy Nilly,"Izzy was a passenger in the car, Marco was drunk and was driving from a party. All Izzy can remember is that she was going face to face toward a tree.She ended up in a hospital for a month. The doctor told her that they would have to amputetate her leg. Because of Marco, she has to pay for his ignorince.This book is sad and I didn't like it that much but it did teach a lesson."
4,Drinking and Driving,"Izzy,Willy,Nilly is a great book about the ups and downs of being a teenager. I think that every person who thinks its cool to drink should read this book."
4,Izzy Willy-Nilly,At my school I was assigned to read this book. It was actually a very good book. I am an obcessive reader and I think this was the 8th best book I've ever read! This book will always keep you on the edge of your seat seeing what Rosamunde and Izzy will do next.
5,!!!!!!READ IF CHANCE COMES ALONG!!!!!!,"The book Izzy, Willy-Nilly wasa rated 5 stars from me because i thought that the book was very interesting and very insightful to the ways of real life accedents. the book seriously should be read if you ever have the chance, unlike some of the othetrs reviews this is a very interesting book and should be read by everybody who has thwe chance."
3,Review,"I read Izzy Willy Nilly for a novel reading assignment in my Reading class. I didn't mind this book because it really followed Izzys Tales. but I am not a big reader so I didn't completely enjoy this book. But all in all it is educational, interesting, and it teaches you sevral lessons on how to handle problems with people"
3,childish,The book had a message that everyone knows all ready. it would be a good book for the teenagers.
1,Get into the life of Izzy,"Izzy, Willy-Nilly is a very interesting book. It is about a girl who was in a car accident with a drunk driver who just happened to be her date that evening. So she had to get her leg amputated. Izzy tells about her time at the hospital and when she arrives back home. Before the accident she feels like she doesn't want to do anything, and after the accident when she is incapable to do anything, she wants to get out and have fun. This book teaches you a lesson that you should do what you want to do in life, because there may not be another time to do it. I liked the book, but I hated how she would just keep on talking about the same thing over and over again. Other than that, I enjoyed it."
2,Not the Greatest Book,"Izzy Willy-Nilly is a slow moving book and a boring one, I could fall asleep reading it. I hate how it tells what she does everyday when she does the exact same thing. It would have been better if the author would have made the book move faster, more details, and made it more exciting. Also in the book she repeats the same things. I would recommemd this book to anyone who like slow moving books and dull ones too."
2,kinda boring/1 pragraph of school work changes by abby,"this story was kinda boring or maybe even all boring but i just had to read it for school.I thought it was becuase it was extremley slow. some of the chapters only talked about depress depress and depress.It was kinda interesting in some chapters. I thought rosamunde didnt really realize how rude she was and poor izzy had to go through her. i would have told her to shutup to listen to me. I think that Marco should have been punished. Marco should have been put into jail or his driver's license should have been taken away. I think Rosamunde should have been nicer. It was nice of Lisa to respond to the action mature and not freak out like Suzy, and Lauren. In the begining Tony would stand up for Izzy and she would have never lost her leg."
2,Not impressed,"My son was required to read this book for school. Although it discusses complex themes and human insecurities... all too common emotions, it wasn't an enjoyable read for a teenage boy. He read it because it was required and he complained because the main character whines and complains constantly..... too much whining going on.Unless your child has to read this for school.... skip it. Life has too much drama to add to it."
2,OK... but really boring,I had to read this book for summer reading like so many other kids. It wasn't too bad but... most of it was just boring. Half the book your reading about Izzy while she's in the hospital and it just gets so boring. I'm a boy and I think this book was targeted towards girls... but I had to read it for school. The book tried to make you feel sorry for Izzy buy you know what? I wasn't sorry for her. The characters were so dull and boring. I didn't care about them at all.
1,this book is boring,this book is really boring i advise u not to read it you'll fall a sleep reading it DON'T READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Melodramatic pap!,"Come on! Ever heard of a prosthesis? This is the worst kind of pity-pot, melodramatic, victim story. The trauma of disabilty is real. This book is not."
1,Don't do this to yourself,"Right now I would like to write how bad this book is, buy suming it up this is the kind of book I would like to keep close to the toilet in case I run out of toliet paper. Girl gets into wreck, Girl loses leg, lonely when friends leave, hate them while they are there. WTF????? She is lonely but then hates their presence. DUMB,DUMB,DUMB. I never cried while reading this, actually I hoped that maybe the doctors would just kill her in her sleep to end the pain of everyon trying to please this tramp."
4,"Izzy, Willy Nilly","Couldn't Stop Reading It!!!, October 25,2004This book was very good, I couldn't put it down. After reading the first few pages I was hooked. I actully read every night for a change, even on weekends.This book is about a girl, Izyy (Isobel) Langard, who is asked out to a party by a senior, Marco. At this party drinking is going on and Marco gets wasted. On the way home to drop Izzy off Marco crashes them into an elm tree. Marco doesn't get hurt at all, but Izzy on the other hand had to get her left leg amputated just below the knee. Through out the book Izzy has to learn to deal with life without her left leg.I recommend this book for people from grades 6th to 8th. I liked this book because it kept me interested and it taught a valuable lesson. Don't drink and drive and don't drive with people who are drunk. On a scale from 1-10 I give Izzy, Willy Nilly a 9. Although it is a good book I wish there would have been a little more detail to the ending."
3,i kind of liked this book,I give this book a three because this book is sad. I think this book is sad because Izzy goes to a senior party with a boy named Marco and he gets drunk and as soon as he is ready to go home he gets into his car and he drives right into a tree. Then we found out that Izzy has to get her leg cut off and after a month she goes back to school and Marco called her a bad name because she was crippled. I like this book because it was intersting. I thought the book was intersting because it talkes about what you never now is going to happen to you and you should take adventage of what you have.
4,This book is about knowing who your real friends are.,Izzy the main character of the book has paid many cosucenses for being in a car with a drunck person.{Marco}She finally realizes who her real friends are.By the way they have been treating her after she lost her leg. This book is really about understanding who will always be there for you in the goods or bads.The main reason for you to read this book is to understand the straigh you really have deep in inside of you.
2,THE MOST BORING BOOK EVER!,"THE BEGINING OF A BOOK IS SUPPOSED TO GRAB THE READER'S ATTENTION. THIS BOOK DIDN''T! MY FRIEND SAID THAT SHE GOT THROUGH 3 CHAPTERS AND GOT BORED. I DIDN'T STOP BUT IT WAS TIME UNNESSARILY WASTED. WE AGREE WITH THE READER FROM SEATTLE. WE APPEAL TO ANY PERSON READING THIS BOOK, STOP! FIND ANOTHER BOOK! (NO OFFENCE TO THE AUTHOR AND ANYONE WHO LIKES it of coarse) sorry for the shouting. didn't know.:)"
2,Shallow Girl Has To Become Amputee To Grow,"I remember reading this book when I was an adolescent, and how I just did not relate to the main character Izzy at all. She is just a shallow and popular cheerleader type until she gets into a car accident and must have a leg amputated. Suddenly, all her groovy friends stop calling and she is no longer BWOC. Because none of the cool kids will hang with her because of the stigma of her disability, she is sort of forced through her new associations with more down to earth people to be less shallow and more mature. I was just not that impressed with her growth or this book."
2,Too much DETAIL!!!!!!,"This book was a required summer reading book for my upcoming school year. I admit that it was a moving book and all, but it just dragged on so SLOW!! The author spends too many out of the 280 pages to talk about how depressed Izzy is in huge detail!Still a book that high schoolers should read."
4,Great Book,"I liked the beginning of this book because it showed how she got in the accident and it was exciting but in the middle, it got a little boring with her in the hospital. At the end, it was exciting again. I liked the book a lot!Carrie T."
3,"Izzy, Willy- Nilly","Izzy, Willy-Nilly, is about a young girl about fifteen years old. Her name is Izzy. She was in a terrible car accident with a drunk senior, Marco. Her life completely changed when her leg was amputated, and she was in the hospital for months. Making new friends, leaving some old ones and becoming closer to her family was all part of the healing method for her.But what was the hardest fact for her to face, was the fact she was ""crippled."" How do you think Izzy got through it? I think this is a very good book and for many teens 12-17 who could relate. I also think you could be a little younger, as long as you are mature enough and able to handle the drama."
5,"This was an amazing, sad and inspirational book!","I read this book, Izzy Willy Nilly by Cynthia Voigt and I absolutely loved it more each time I read it! It shows you the things that you have to put in to perspective in your life-what are your morals and who are really your true friends. Izzy learned valuable lessons after her accident-how not to judge a person by how they might appear on the outside but really look at them and see what they are like on the inside. I think this idea was illustrated beautifully in the story about how in the beginning she never bothered to get to know Rosamunde because she wasn't ""cool"" enough and seemed like a weirdo. But when she got to really know her, she saw that there was more to her and they had a valuable friendship. This book was amazing and you have to read it!!!!"
5,Amazing Triumph!,"'Izzy' is the kind of book that can make a reader out of a middle school student. (see 'Naked Reading') As an adult tutor of a middle school student, 'Izzy Willy-Nilly' was very difficult for me to put down.There are great lessons about friendships; about overcoming depression; and about family ties that can be a saving grace. The book may be classified as 'Young Adult,' but grown-ups can enjoy it too!"
3,Touches the surface...,"This book is a great source of information for life in ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphic explanations are offered (from a mundane point of view), clothing and hairstyles are explained, food and artistic cultures are discussed. All of these are explored within sexuality and its expression through Egypt's creation/origination stories. I learned very much about Egypt's pantheon and many questions were answered which I haven't found in other works on Egypt. My only complaint with this beautiful book is the lack of spiritual application. Sexual energy is a necessary part of awakening and enlightenment, and the ancient Egyptians were fully aware of this. The practice, study and employment of sacred sex was a vital piece of their esoteric learning. I was disappointed to find the authors ignoring this aspect completely. After reading the book, the title is misleading. It is ""sacred"" sexuality only in the sense that the practices studied were originated in the religion of that era."
2,Eh,"Not nearly as good as it sounded to me. Illustrations are mostly line drawings, writing is dry, much speculative and almost puritanical information."
3,Not sacred spirituality,"i have to agree with the other 3 star reviewer that there is no discussion of sacred sexuality in this book and not erotic secrets of the forbidden papyrus (the subtitle of the book).The line drawings on paintings, vases and papyrus are beautiful, showing a lot of affection between partners, particularly the lesbian depictions, but there is nothing here that will give you an insight or incentive to bring sacred sexuality into your life."
4,Nice,"It is exactly what it says, not the exact size of a official game ball but looks just like a real football"
4,Right choice but deflated,Purchased as gift. Exactly the item I wanted. Disappointed that football in packaging was not fully inflated with air to use right out of the box.
1,Chinese,"When I read the product description of this football, it was described as the same as it's full size brother, even the ""same quality leather"", it's not leather, only a smaller version. Earlier I had seen a video on You Tube on how a football was made. It was shot in the Wilson factory in Ohio and the manager stated that all footballs that have the Wilson name on them, are only made in that factory. So I took it for granted that this was an American made football. So I was crushed when I saw the made in China stamp on the ball. Therefore I felt misled and therefore the one star rating. If it wasn't for that, this is a great little football."
3,Not what the editor says it is,"This ball is exactly what is says it is, and nothing more. It is in fact a replica of the official NFL ball, but that is where the similarities end. Unlike the product description that puts it as worthy of a place on the mantle because of its exact replica laces, high quality leather and so on, this ball is just another football. I enjoy it because it looks good on my desk, but I bought it thinking that it was of the same high quality as the official ball. It is not. It is made in China and is OBVIOUSLY synthetic... forget the ""high quality leather"" that is described as being in the description.The ball is worth having for a decorative piece, or for playing with kids, but do not get it if you are looking for an equal quality replica of the real ball."
2,Not as good as previous models,This tester is not as good as previous models. My employer has an older tester of this make and model and it works much better than this one.
1,peak personal care ladies battery operated shaver,I am dissapointed with the product. I purchased four as gifts; none of them operated properly. It was quite embarrassing.
5,ageless,"leonard Martin has lost view of romantic truth. I was 17 when i first saw this film- the title song sung by Warwick still invokes hope that true love is possible, even after all these years! As does the film- sure its alot of fantasy, but there has been that in my life- the trick is holding on to that romance! but this movie, that i still remember so clearly all these years past, reminds me that love is still there, still attainable, still possible- it made me believe, and still, keeps Hope alive. Perhaps I'm just a romantic- this film helps keep that alive in me."
5,Unforgettable....?,"I can't even remember when I saw this movie! All I know it was excellent; over the time, I tried to remember what was the argument, but all I could recall was the end of the story: Jack and Catherine (Catherine, I love you) get away together. They had the guts! Now that someone favoured me with amacon.com directions to look for the movie, I had the chance to read other reviewers' comments and refreshed my mind over it. I wish I could find someone who could sell it or a web site to play it or a movie exchange. It's an unforgettable film."
5,One of My Favorite Movies of All Times,"I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it. I saw it on video not too long ago and it brought back some great memories. For everyone who loves romantic comedies like Sabrina, Sleepless In Seattle, Pretty Woman, To Gillian On Her 34th Birthday, While You Were Sleeping, etc.... you must see this one. I guarantee you'll love it."
1,THIS COPY IS CUT 9 MINUTES! BOOTLEG!,"I want to make a warning about that copy. After 40 years searching for this wonderful movie and finally find a copy on DVD, I thought everything would be fine. But I warn the fans of Jack Lemmon: DON'T BUY THIS COPY ON DVD! It's a pirated copy produced by an unknown label Spain called Cinecom. The picture quality is awful, misty, and the worst: THIS COPY IS CUT 9 MINUTES! Yes, this copy has only 86 minutes, and not the 95 minutes originals! Honestly I am very sad because this is one of the best films of Jack Lemmon, and I could not review a lot of important scenes, because this trash DVD is cut in 9 minutes! The proprietors of this damn Cinecom should be arrested, these guys real do piracy! Total disappointment!"
3,Buy a network security book with this software!,"I hope you work in networking or have prior experience with firewalls, because, if you don't, you'll have only cursory understanding of this product. They provide no substantial documentation either in the box or on their website. Since I work in this field, I was able to figure it out on my own, but you're probably better off shelling out a few more bucks for 'Black Ice Defender' or 'Norton Personal Firewall'. As for the actual software, it seems to work fine and has most of the standard features for firewall software in this price range. Overall, it's a good package for anyone looking for simple protection for their home systems and will keep all but the serious hackers out."
1,Adequate for novices only,"This is an adequate product if you do nothing but surf unsecure web pages and you're happy with their default configuration. If you shop online, run personal web server on your PC or do anything else that's not plain vanilla, this does not work. On top of that tech support is awful and the automated uninstall does not work.I read one review which said that you could not use this if you weren't technical. Well, I'm technical and I hate it as well. If you understand network security the lack of basic options with this software is maddening."
1,Awful,"Couldn't get it to work with Windows 2000 and a dial-up account. After searching their site for a while, I found one note to this effect. Two technicians couldn't help me at all with this problem, and I would think this is a fairly common setup. Bad tech support, poor installation and documentation.I'll never buy another McAfee product again."
5,"Might encourage a child's curiosity, but also a great toy for adults!","As a gag gift for the Sherlock fan this is fabulous. Depending on the child, this might encourage curiosity and exploration, and even some limited action play. But I view this action figure and those like it as mostly an adult toy. My Sherlock fan hubs loves his!"
5,SHERLOCK HOLMES Action Figure,"Finally!!!! A collectible action figure of the famous detectiveSHERLOCK HOLMES! Me and other fans have waited years for this.I bought 2. One to stare at in its box, and one to play with.---There is not much action to him, the only thing he does is movehis arms at the elbows up and down. His hat is removable, hispipe is not. His pipe is rather brittle and can break, it canbecome a problem. His magnifying glass really works!!!! The boxhe comes in explains all about him, his history. It is a greatsouvenir. --- He cannot turn his head sideways, and he cannotbend his knees or sit. But he is a great memory to stare at forus fans. Looks almost like actor BASIL RATHBONE with the longface.--- I got this action figure next to my bed. To stare at,not play with. --- There is also an Edgar Allan Poe action figuretoo available. Do investigate it if you can. Always, AMAZON.COM----- Luisa Felix, Hoboken, New Jersey"
5,He's too cute!,"He's a great addition to my Wilde, Austen and Gandalf action figures. They are on my bookshelf as little shrine while I write."
4,Sherlock Holmes Action Figure,Great for a budding sleuth. My grandson loves the old Sherlock mystery series on PBS. He did chores around the house to buy an outfit at goodwill to dress up like Sherlock and uses a magnifying glass to find clues to the stories he makes up at home. This will go along with his imagination and creative play for ole Sherlock and his adventures.
1,exploded,"First time I used it, I made baklava in the oven at 350 F for 30 min. I took it out and set it on top of the stove which was at room temperature. Less than a minute it exploded."
2,Poor quality!!,I loved this table at first but 6 months later it began to chip and peal on the edges. So unhappy!!
4,Better than the movie!,"Emlyn William's ""Headlong"" is the source work for the movie ""King Ralph"". Although the vague outline of the plot is the same, the details are quite different.""Headlong"" (without it's americanized additions) presents a much more complex man thrown onto the throne; you learn much more about who he is and how he copes with the demands placed on him. The background gives the reader a much better understanding of the events during his reign.""King Ralph"" was (admittedly mildly entertaining) fluff; ""Headlong"" is far superior."
5,awesome ukulele,This ukulele is awesome although I didn't buy it on amazon.com I love this ukulele and I would recommend it to anyone. If this is what it says it is it is definitely worth the money.
1,"Bait and switch: the product has changed, this is 270 mAh","The pathetic Amazon listing here doesn't bother to list the volts and amps on this battery. Other reviews suggest it is 400 mAh, which is what I needed, and if you google V Tech 80-5074-00-00 you'll find confirmation of that number. But the product being sold under this label was changed and what they ship is 270 mAh. (The picture doesn't match the product either.) It was a mistake to buy this when the information given is so totally inadequate. The batteries were cheap, but the shipping wasn't, and both were a waste."
1,Battery Lasted 10 Months,"When I first received this battery, it worked fine. But after 10 months it will no longer hold a decent charge. I can't talk on my cordless phone for longer than 10 minutes. I am going to order a replacement battery from a different manufacturer that has a 4-1/2 star rating.By the way of comparison, the original battery I got with the phone lasted 4 years."
4,It works,I bought this to replace a similar one on my vtech phone that was dieing. It fit perfectly into the phone and works fine. I hesitate to give it 5 stars on battery life cos I've only had it now for less than 2 months and don't know for sure if its going to have longevity. But so far I don't have any complaints.
5,Excellent phone battery replacement,This battery pack came charged and ready to use. It works fine on my cordless phone. I am very satisfied with this product. I recommend this product and the company.
4,Only 400 ma! Beware...,"I give the battery 4-stars for being a decent battery, and I give myself only 1-star for being such an idiot and not checking the amperage rating. The battery I removed from the phone is a very large 2000 ma battery which fits properly. This new battery is only 400 ma, and is so small it rattles around (about 50% the size of the old one). I should have looked at the photo more carefully, and I should have bought a battery that lists the amps. All that being said, the battery arrived pre-charged, and holds a charge okay, just don't expect to talk for too long."
3,Adequate,"This battery seems great for the price. At Radio Shack, I pay $15 for a phone battery and it usually lasts 2-3 years. This one has lasted 8 months. That's not good. I'd rather pay more and get a longer life. Maybe I got a bad one, except I see another consumer only had it for 4 months before going."
5,Incredible Read,"The book Owl Island is an amazing read. The standard reviews above, DON'T READ as they give away the story and shed a not so great light on it making it seem dull. The book lets you into the life of Phoebe, the main character as well as her daughter all essentially following the tale of how she got to the point in her life she is with a past full of passion and that one person who mesmerizes you and fundamentally changes you by allowing you to live and not live at the same time. It truly was an incredible book and I'll be sure to be reading it again."
4,A deeply satisfying read,"Started Owl Island two days ago and finished it this afternoon. I was hooked! Lots of things I loved: the characters, whom we come to know and care about, the unfolding of an emotional plot but without maudlin sentimentality, the evocative descriptions of landscape, of the island, of Phoebe's net mending. The whole thing rang true and is very nicely written. Surely worth reading!"
2,"Good story, but could have taken up half the pages and words...","I'm not going to go into much detail with this. I felt the storyline was good, but I tell you, this took me literally MONTHS to read because the first half of the book was overly descriptive and very broken up, going back and forth from the past to the present. I was about two-thirds through the book before I could read more than a few pages before being totally bored and shutting off my light and falling asleep. Once Laurienne is more in the picture, things get more interesting, but Whit is totally predictable from the beginning, and then the story is wrapped up in just a few pages, as if someone were in a hurry to close up the book. I might read another of her books, but I might not. Good description is always lovely to have in a book, but I felt she WAY overdid it. I kept skimming half and whole pages thinking, ""When is she going to get to the point????"""
3,What's the fuss?,"This is a good cookbook as far as cookbooks go. I just don't understand what the fuss is all about and it makes me suspitious. If you like the recipes then use the book and if you don't, just give the book away, sell it or donate it! I thought it was a good enough book to send a copy to my daughter, who is half Armenian, for Christmas and that is that!"
1,Very underwhelming,I'm Armenian and grew up eating Armenian food. I bought this book and showed it to my aunt and mother - both of whom are excellent Armenian cooks. They told me to return it. Enough said.
1,dissapointing and dull,"I have been trying to use this book for several weeks. I find the recipes dull and uninteresting. Written in a one sided view of Armenian cooking I keep trying to find a recipe that is usable in TODAYS Armenian kitchen and find that this book stays on my shelf collecting dust. It is like the washed out colors on the cover ""dull!"""
5,Worth every penny,"Sonia Uvezian has provided us with a truly engaging, scholarly exploration of one of the world's most exciting culinary traditions. If you want to become knowledgable about Armenian cooking, this exceptional book, which is packed with valuable information and splendid recipes you won't find elsewhere, is essential."
5,A landmark classic and a national treasure,"If you want to discover the heart and soul of Armenian cuisine, this is the book for you. Its text is highly informative and its recipes are clear and precise, producing utterly delectable results. My family is constantly requesting that I make dishes from this book. In fact, ""The Cuisine of Armenia"" has gotten so much use in my kitchen that I have had to purhase a second copy. I heartily recommend that you buy two copies as well, for you will want to cook from this indispensable guide for many years to come."
5,Good to write with!,"This set of red ball pens is really a good choice. Cheap, good quality, and the red color is very beautiful. my favorite red ball pens ever~"
5,One of My Favorite Pens!,"I love these pens. I used them since I was in elementry school. Since I'm in school I take notes constantly and these are my go-to. The have a consistant ink flow and doesn't skip like other pens. These pens don't smear as much as the others I have tried which is really good. As for some other Bic cheap and expensive pens I have used, these are the best. For the low price I highly recommend."
4,Great pens,"These pens are great. They're cheap, last a long time, and also write great. Sometimes I wish that they wrote bolder and thicker, but if you really want something that writes better you'll need to spend a bit more money and maybe buy a gel pen. These last me longer than any other pens and I really like that you can actually see when you are going to be out of ink. It's a pen, what else can you say about it?"
2,"""New"" pens drying out","I bought a package of these pens at Wal-mart for about a dollar as I needed pens. Can't say I'm happy with them. What are brand new pens often take a good deal of scribbling for any ink to come out on a consistent basis across multiple pens in the same package. And when you do get ink to come out, often times it is faint, like the pen is drying out. I'm all for buying bulk when it comes to office items like this, but apparently a dollar will only take you so far. I'd recommend buying other pens."
3,Classic pen but not great option for long term writing,"These are truly a classic pen. I've used these pens randomly throughout high school and loved them. They are pretty run of the mill ball point pen, what I really dig about them is that the ink level is easily viewable something that seems to be hard to find these days.However, now that I'm older and actually writing more frequently I find these pens quite uncomfortable for long-term writing [anything over 30 minutes]. This is mainly because of the lack of grip on the pen and the way these pens are shaped you are likely to have the points digging into your fingers. If these pens were to have a grip on them it would make these pens near perfect."
3,what happened to Bic?,"I used to use these pens when I was in school and they were great (I used the blue and black ones, not red). But I just bought a pack of these and they don't seem to work well at all, ink not flowing that well and for some reason, the ink color is VERY light. I don't understand what happened to Bic, unless they've become one of the many companies today who outsource their manufacturing and so make products of substantially reduced quality. My Paper Mate red pens are far better and the ink a proper red color. I don't think I'll be buying Bic pens again."
1,Very Disappointed,"I had to return this item when many, many of the pens were dried out and had faint, fading ink. These were quickly replaced, but I am still have trouble with many pens leaking, many dried out, and writing with pale light blue ink rather than the medium point darker blue ink I have come to expect from using bic pens since the 1970s. Time to look for a new blue pen, I guess. Very disappointed."
1,A waste of money,"Ad does not match the product you will receive. What you receive is BIC Cristal pens, with octagonal handles, not round. They are not the Stic model. The pens write like they are old and dried out. The pens write very light, ink flows poorly. They just don't work. I discarded them. You can get the real BIC Ultra Round Stic Grip Med point at Staples for $2.49/dozen."
2,"If you need a book this simple, you may be in trouble","If you are interested in this book to learn more about sex, then you probably won't learn anything more because you already know what it contains. The material is very basic (and while it's good to state the basics there is also a place for what comes after the basics, and it isn't included here).If you don't expect much then this won't disappoint you, but it won't pleasently surprise you either."
2,1970s softcore porn,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a softcore porn moviefrom 1975. This film would be considered very mild on today's cable TV stations. RebeccaBrooks and Jody Ray are both very nice looking women and show a lot of skin. The plotis a rich man's daughter is kidnapped and introduced into the sexual world by hercaptors. This film has been edited quite a bit from the original and the transferplays like a third generation VHS tape recording. Rebecca Brooks has a few other filmson Amazon and all of them are much better than this one.
3,Not bad,"The book told me some things about the sith I didn't know, but most of it I already knew from other sources"
4,good,"It told you a lot about the sith and how it started, but most of it comes from the expanded universe. It did not give you much detail of the sith in the movie. Great pictures. Its a good deal for sith fans, you might learn some thing."
1,Again!!!!!!!!!!,Do not buy this book until you read my review of a previous reprint identical to this one which also received one star from me for cause. This is volume one of a set of three volumes.
2,"some good information, but better avilable elsewhere","This book has some solid information, but it is all available elsewhere except some studies on Point & Figure profitability. However, tests in 2002 by djbaker suggested that the profitability of these signals had broken down, so i'm not sure how useful this book really is. Like the previous reviewer, i'd recommend reading the Dorsey book first."
4,Dru Lombar continues his rock and roll roots legacy.,"Dru Lombar's latest project, Dr. Hector & the Groove Injectors, carries on the legacy that he instilled while with the great southern roots rock and roll band, Grinderswitch.Inspired by the Allman Brothers and Marshall Tucker Band (with whom he toured with regularly while with Grinderswitch), this new album will be sure to please fans of any of these bands. From the very first track, The Fever, to the title track and ultimately with Psychotherapy, Lombar's heavy guitar licks explode and drive the listener to shake rattle and roll. Lombar's original music and lyrics remind us of the 70's explosion of southern rock and roll, and leaves us wanting more. Let's hope his next album comes sooner than the almost 15 years between his last releases."
5,Rockin' Blues the way it should be,"Great album in general, & I absolutely Love the songs ""Through the Eyes of a Child"", and ""The High Cost of Living"". This band is better than the Allman Bros. . First heard and saw them at The Phoenix in Delray Beach, FL circa 1986. Was very impressed with them back then. They were not famous, still aren't, and deserve to be. Saw Dr. Hector again live in The House of Blues, Myrtle Beach, SC circa 2000. The club had them perform in the restaurant, where there was virtually no dancefloor, while there was a disco cover band and an MTV half-assed commercial rock band in the bigger rooms that had people partying on dance floors. Go figure. How insulting to a Truly great BLUES band ! House of Blues ? ? ? ?"
5,The Alphabet Comes Alive,"Zoopa is an amazingly illustrated book that not only keeps my 3 year old engaged, but also my 10-month-old. As each new letter is introduced, we love ""searching"" for the animal that matches it. Just a beautiful book."
4,Very nice children's book!,"My 2-year old originally got ""hooked"" on this book after we found it at the library; after we'd borrowed it 3 consecutive times for him, he still wanted to read it every day, so we bought a copy! He loves all the animal pictures, and it has helped him to learn both the animals' names and his alphabet. Definitely a very nice children's book!"
4,Interesting Narrative of the Civil War,"This is a good overview of the American Civil War. I listened to it while driving and found it well-written. The narration is clear, very professional.My only complaint is that occasionally the stories are not chronological and that should have been explained. However this is still entertaining and informative.The audio cassette is fast disappearing, but personally I like the format because I can remove the tape and later find me place instantly."
3,A cute cozy but very tiny print,"This is a cute cozy by a good author. I would have given it 4 stars, except that this paperback edition (by Berkley) has extremely small print with practically no space between the lines. It makes reading tiring and more of a chore than a pleasure. So definitely read this quite charming book, just not in this edition."
3,Entertaining,"Evans Above is a cozy Welsh village mystery with humor and hints of romance. It has elements of a police procedural and the art of detection but falls somewhat short in these aspects. Nevertheless, while slight it is quite entertaining."
3,Ballykissangel meets MC Beaton in Wales,"Not heavy on the mystery department, but a cute and very short mystery set in the Welsh countryside. A lot of characters in the town, sort of reminded me of James Herriot's Yorkshire characters, but without the emotion. Good little read."
3,"A good plot, flat characters","I guess although I enjoyed the overall plot of the murder mystery and was intrigued by the clever way that the author put it ""by"" me, I was not as engaged by the characters. They seemed too ""stock"" and two dimensional to be enjoyable; however, before giving up on the series altogether, I might read a second book to see if they grow on me."
2,not so good detective book,"Because I liked the first book in the Murphy series by the same author, I tried this series - didn't even make it through the first ook - too much swearing."
3,slow reading,"I've heard rave reviews of the Constable Evans series but I hope the other titles in the series are better mysteries than this one.The story line is intriguing enough that I finished reading it, but I found lots of repetitions in the plot as well as in the writing. The same women try over and over and over again with the same ploy to get the Constable's attention. The same complaint about his landlady who tries to feed him good food. The same annoyance at a minister's wife who insists on finding out who's trespassed her garden.The story is set in Wales, and there are bits and pieces of the Welsh diction inter-dispersed in the dialogues. But the entire time I was reading, I found myself wanting to be convinced that the author indeed knew enough about life in a Welsh village to set a story in it. In the end, I am not convinced at all."
4,Catches the flavor of the Welsh and their surroundings,"This is a delightful romp up and down Mt. Snowdon in north Wales. The mystery is not the most compelling or intense, but the narrative accurately portrays the Welsh independent characteristics and dialog, describes the beautiful country side and unique climate, and alludes to the differences between the Welsh and English. The book brings back fond memories for anyone who has visited this charming part of Wales. A book full of charm and humor. I'm looking forward to the next ramblings of Constable Evans -- and a trip back to Mt. Snowdon."
2,Good idea spoiled by workmanlike prose,"The Welsh countryside setting of this mystery novel is unusual, the characters are potentially intriguing, and the plot is decent enough, but the writing style is too dull and workmanlike. The narrative never, ever sings, and the dialogue never rises above the terribly mundane. Because of the little-seen setting and the pleasant characters, I wanted to like this book a lot more than I did. Readable, but I'm afraid I won't be seeking out any more titles by this author."
4,Aquatic sci-fi/fantasy!,"Fans of the author's previous work, Battle Angel Alita, may be a little surprised by the subject of this manga. Instead of the dark, far future of 'Alita', we are introduced to a sunshiny, medieval-flavored fantasy realm at the edge of the world. A terrific change from most comics out there, I was quite impressed with Aqua Knight, and I'm waiting for future volumns. The characters are well-defined, for the most part, and provide an emotional element to the story which helps to drive it along. As a brief note for the uninitiated, the Japanese in general are quite comfortable depicting nudity, child or adult, and this is apparent in Aqua Knight. I personally feel that this does not detract from the book's merit in any way, I merely mention this in passing for the benefit of those who have not previosly experienced the manga art form, and would like to. In that case, or if you are already a fan, I can recommend this book as a good introduction."
1,Lasts about 10 seconds,"Thymes Frasier Fir scent is very pricey and the bottle is very light. It must have only a few milliliters of fluid in it. So I expected it to be potent stuff ! Unfortunately, although the scent is nice and piney, it lasts less than a minute. At first I used a short spray, then a LOOOOOONG spray...still no lasting pine smell. I'm going to try to return it and would never buy it again."
2,Thymes Frasier Fir Fragrance Mist,"I have been buying Fraiser fir Christmas trees my whole adult life (40 years). I was really expecting the realistic piney sweet smell that you get from a Fraiser Fir when you rub the fresh needles with your fingers...This product did not deliver for me. The small metal dispenser seemed only half full, and the fragrance was not as I expected, and did not linger when sprayed. At about [...] including shipping, I would not re-purchase."
5,"Funny to read, even funnier to do!","I've seen Mac's great and funny show at Harrah's in Las Vegas and will never forget him making his head disappear. It was so totally unexpected, it was just hilarious. With this book you can learn to make your own head disappear too, along with a couple dozen other great tricks, stunts and gags that take minimal skill and practice. Most of them do contain a similar unexpected, bizzarre twist that will make you laugh out loud just by imagining yourself performing them. This is a funny, funny book. I'm going to be giving a lot of them at Christmas!"
2,Tricked me,This book was a let down. I thought it would be more entertaining but it lacked that. There were a couple tricks here and there that were funny but that's about it. I guess I would have to read it again to like it. I just expected more.
3,Just giving a link to the sample pages,"I've used the curriculum before, it was okay. Just not a good fit for my children. You need to have quiet time, one on one, with the child in order to do this as it's designed. That just doesn't happen too often in our home.[...]"
3,Bad Mr. Snakey!,"Not one of Dick's better adaptaions, another author could have fleshed out the story a little better. The charecters are flat and unenjoyable, the Mara is not that scary. Over all a generic sort of Who story.Why does Tegan always seem to cause so much trouble?"
4,Saving the world,"An easier day for the Doctor than usual as he only needs to save one world this time, not the entire universe. A long banished evil, the Mara, plots its return. The Doctor is aided by Nyssa in this one. Tegan is also with the Doctor but through no fault of her own is more of an opponent than an ally.The Doctor discovers the evil plot and then cannot convince the locals that he is right and they should help him. It always amazes me how the Doctor gets such quick access to the people in power. In this one he regularly makes it to the company of the hier to the title of Federator, ruler of a group of worlds. He also manages to get thrown in jail, as does Nyssa, but they manage to escape.Quite a fun book and a quick read."
4,Very Good overall phone system.,I recieved the phone system promptly with no hassles. It has been very good so far with no problems. It looks great mounted on the wall compared to others that I have had. It seems to work great with all of its bells and whistles.
1,Speakerphone is useless,"I had to return this phone. The speakerphone, which I use almost exclusively, was very harsh, poor sound quality in comparison to my old Panasonic wireless. It also cuts out if the other person doesn't speak loudly. I was very dissatisfied with this phone."
5,CEO'S DREAM BOOK FOR MANAGING BUSINESS PROCESSES,"I have read a few hundred ""non-fictional"" books over the years for my MBA, for quality, etc, but I have to tell you that this book about the use of balanced scorecards is the best business related book that I have ever read, and I feel that every CEO should completely absorb it to utilize its ""pertinent"" applications that are applicable to their business processes, thus institutionalizing the process metrics' continual improvement concepts of ISO/TS 16949:2002 and ISO 9001 in all types of firms, including those that are not automotive suppliers!- Bill Cooper, Global Quality Systems Senior Manager, Lear Corporation"
5,Business Scorecard,"""Six Sigma Business Scorecard provides easy to implement corporate performance measurement guidelines. If you want to improve your company's profitability, learn all about it fast because the race is won by the one who improves first.""I really like reading the book, especially, Bob Galvin's interview about leadership."
5,Outstanding,This book is fabulous. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in successfull implementation of Six Sigma.
3,the Kindle version is wretched,"I'm sad to be rating this so low. The book is quite good, but the Kindle version of it is an example of lazy publishing. I am in a book group and was the only one with the electronic version. Therefore, it was very easy for me to verify that the Kindle version is riddled full of typos while the print versions are not. On top of that, the publisher DIDN'T INCLUDE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. It makes jumping between sections incredibly difficult. There is no excuse for the lack of effort that went into setting this book up for the Kindle, interestingly, a device that the book itself seems to predict.Read the book, but know ahead of time that if you choose the Kindle version, it is flawed."
3,"Good story, bgut poor product quality...","This is a well-written story, but the overall quality of the printed book was the worst I have ever encountered. Several pages scattered through a portion of the volume had the upper page margin inserted part way down the page, even splitting one line horizontally through the type letters! Even a paperback book should be printed with a modicum of attention to quality!"
2,"Not Gaia, again...","My reaction to this book was not good. I am not disposed to at all appreciate a Gaia ecosermon. I find that naive, shallow and boring. Nor did I think that either characters or plot were very well developed -- it jumped around like a nervous chicken in a barnyard and had no time for development. I am trying my best to finish the book (since I paid for it), but I confess I have not yet succeeded -- it's tough sledding. On the other hand, I recall with fondness Dr. Brin's Sundiver trilogy; I know that he is a very capable writer. I will read more of his works, but this one looks like a potboiler to me."
2,More Eco nut ramblings,"Sheesh! Where do I begin? It could have been a fun book if it wasn't for incessant preaching about how we're poisoning the world! Doomsday is coming! Good Lord man. You're a good writer, just save the soapbox preaching and give us a good story. The people that say this is totally plausible are nuts."
5,Earth,"This book has an incredible depth of thought, plot, and characters. It somehow melds it all into an entertaining cohesive whole. If you want a brainless read or candy coated pseudo-sci-fi, look elsewhere. If you want uterly fantastic high quality science fiction, buy this book!"
3,a bit too intricate,"Let me make this clear - I love David Brin. And this book was excellent as always. He has great ideas, great stories, and great characters. However this particular book felt a bit ""dense"" - I felt at times I was slogging through detail just to get to the ""good"" parts. If you really like his stuff, then you'll probably enjoy this one. But make sure you read his other ones first: the Uplift novels, Kiln People, the Postman, the Practice Effect, Glory Season... they're all excellent, and (I think) much smoother reads."
3,Far from Brin's best work,"Having read most of Brin's other works, I finally got around to reading this one, which is an ambitious and epic near-future story which explores environnmental and social issues extrapolated from contemporary times. Too much science and not enough fiction was the main problem I had with this book. The story often bogs down in scientific and theoretical minutiae, to the detriment of the greater whole. Character development is spotty, with some fleshed out nicely, while others remain shallow and flat. All in all, a decent read, but not up to par with Brin's better works, like the ""Uplift"" series."
1,"Disjointed, tedious and boring.","This book became too tedious after about 100 pages. Although some concepts in this book are interesting, the writing style is all about lots of parallel plot lines, interspersed with disjointed ""news"" and ""net"" clips. It's very predictable and became boring quickly."
2,Good story but boring characters and writing kill this book,"Brin definitely has an interesting plot with many twists and turns. However, his characters are extremely boring and simplistic. The writing also was very mind numbing. I had the feeling that he wrote an outline then feed it into a machine to do the writing for him. These factor detract from an excellent story. Having not read any other works by him I'm not sure if this is the case with all his writing. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
1,As poisonous in it's philosophy as it is thorough,"David Brin is often touted as a Libertarian, but this book belies that. Buy it, because it is destined to be the bible of anti-individualists and devotees of the ""New World Order"" everywhere. It is the perfect antithesis of ""Atlas Shrugged,"" and just as thorough in expounding its philosophical thesis. If you want to understand Ayn Rand, this book is a perfect example of how her fictional villains and real-world opponents think. The book is a tour de force poisonous philosophical tenets, from its metaphysics of pop-mysticism and its epistemology of the ""multiple-personality mind"" to its group-identity ethics, ""third-way"" authoritarian socialist politics, and thinly veiled nihilism. If it does nothing else, this book should be hailed for exposing the ""Whole Earth Movement"" for the collectivism that it is. It is a breathtakingly disturbing read for the rational individualist reader, but priceless for understanding the collectivist mindset."
2,A drag to read.,I was excited to read this book after it was highly recommended to me by a friend. It was so boring! I gave it two stars because I thought the plot was a great idea and I think there is a great story in here with a warning about the future of our environment but it ended up to muddled down. And the characters weren't very interesting at all either - some of them a complete waste of time to read about. I made it through the whole thing because I was curious enough to know how it ended and then I was sorry I spent the time to do so.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Don't drop the black hole, dorkbrains.Set in a mid-21st century Earth, teetering on collapse because of serious overpopulation and ecological problems something more dire and more urgent happens. A small group of scientists make a black hole, and screw up, badly, as it gets away and heads for the Earth's core. This leads to a desperate race and struggle to prevent the planet and people going bye-bye."
1,Disappointing,"I cannot in all conscience recommend this book. Without exception, I've liked everything that Brin wrote before Earth. This book is long, boring, and overly preachy. If you really want to read good Brin, try Startide Rising."
3,A bit mad,"After reading The Postman and finding it one of the best stories I had ever read, I took on Earth and found it a bit mad. Its like lots of big science ideas have been crammed together in a tiny room and they are not getting on. I have read this twice now, but found the second reading more enjoyable than the first, I suppose I knew a little more of what to expect and was more comfortable with it, but well, it was still a tiny bit mad though."
4,Straight Along a Crooked Road,We had to make a cover for the book and write a little thing on the back for school before we read the book. And none of us got to see the real cover except for the teachers pet. Then we read it. The only problem was that we could only read two chapters a week and them we had to write a journal entry. But I liked the book all the same.
2,Difficult to Open,"Nice power, nice features but the BIG problem is that the top is difficult if not impossile to open. You are supposed to push into the plastic to unlock but it only opens sometimes. I have to try and shake the ingredients out of the chute. In a made dash to make guacamole for guests, I had to shake all the ingredients out of the top and ended up tossing this Food Processor out into 10 inches of snow. WOuld be impossible for someone with arthritis or any slight hand flexability difficulty. We have had this machine for about 6 months. Sad, good motor and simple features but not much good with the inability to open this to put the ingredients in or to retrive them."
2,Outdated,"It only took me a few minutes to flip through the entire thing! I was pretty bored with the whole thing. It looked as though it was from the 80's! Nothing contemporary and a complete waste of money and my time. Every picture was sent in by ""real people"", so nothing looked polished. Tons of different layouts, but nothing was my style at all."
1,very old,bought this for inspiration and was very disapointed! this book is both very dated and very simple (some pages had pictures with a few stickers thrown in the blak spots). the only good scrap page is the one on the cover.
4,Good Movie,"I liked this one more than the first one. The theme of this movie is pretty much the same as the first, but i like the storyline better."
5,Call Me Mrs. Miracle Excellent Movie!!,"Rarely do returning characters in a second Movie ever trump the first. This one did for me! It's an entirely different setting and cast except for ""Doris Roberts"" but I liked this movie more than the first one! Doris Roberts is back as Mrs. Merkle a.k.a. Mrs. Miracle, a sweet older woman who you know is an angel sent to save Finley's Department Store from closing after the holidays, mend the strained relationship between the store owner and his Son the toy department manager. Create a love match between him and a stranger who is also an un-appreciated assistant to an over-bearing boss doing a semi-funny job of trying to take care of her brother's son while he's serving in Iraq. It's packed with everything you expect in a feel good Holiday Movie and a lot you don't see coming! The entire cast does a great job in their perspective rolls! Defiantly worth seeing and owning!"
5,A Bit of Fantasy,A delightful bit of fantasy something you have no problem watching with your children. Not many of those around these days. Doris Roberts makes the perfect Mrs. Miracle.
3,.,For me the big city dept. store appeal was not as grat as the small town setting. But it had the same results in the lives of those involved.
2,Disc broke in pieces,"The movie was great but the quality of the product is awful! Upon removing it after 1 time watching it, it was craked and almost peeling of the disc. Looks like the quality of the product is somehow defective...sorry!"
4,A Great Follow Up to Mrs. Miracle,"Holly is a single aunt responsible for her nephew while her brother is deployed overseas. As if this is not overwhelming enough, she must also contend with a demanding boss and a career that is not going exactly as planned.Jake the heir apparent of Finley's department store has also hit a career crisis, trying to convince his father that stocking their store with traditional toys would be a better move.Enter Mrs. Merkle also known as Mrs. Miracle who uses her own brand of heavenly influence to bring these individuals together for a classic heartwarming Christmas.Told in the typical Debbie Macomber style of happily ever after, bringing family and home together, these two movies make for a wonderful snowy afternoon movie marathon day."
5,Excellent Christmas movie!,"Doris Roberts is exceptional. This is fun ""made for TV movie"". It won't win any rewards but it is very good within its genre."
5,Wonderful way to draw your child closer to God!,"My 4 year old daughter and I finished this book and she was not only excited about finishing her first ""big"" book, but she told me how much she enjoyed reading it every night before bedtime. She faithfully reminded me (even when I thought I was too tired to read it to her) that it was time for devotions. It also allowed her and I quality time together and for her to ask questions about God's Word. Recommend highly."
3,Very short,We like this study but have to add to it because it is very brief. This Bible is really better for younger children.
4,What is Love?,"If you want to know the true meaning of ""Love"", read this book! Mr. Johnson has written a highly moving and emotional account of his life's journey with his (now deceased) partner-Larry Rose. Two men who came together from two extremely different upbringings shared a life a love together that few of us ever have a chance to have, yet we all yearn for. Their individual families histories alone are worth reading! The writing is strong and effective, although I did have a few problems with it in spots. I cannot deny feeling nothing but joy at having the opportunity to read this excellent book! In an age where the AIDS crisis seems to be forgotten this is an all to important account of how all lives have changed and is a great testament and history lesson to remind us all. Highly recommended!"
4,Dissection of a heart,"Rarely does a book come along which changes the way you see things. Johnson writes with such command and passion that you are immediatly drawn into his world. I started this book when I was in low spirits and the book quickly made me see the brighter sides of life. Although, its about the death of the loved one the way Johnson writes it doesnt make it fall into the catergory of a b-rate tear jerker. Its more about coming to terms with love, death and life. The reasons to live are the central plot rather then the reasons to die.I weeped at times but at times inwardily smiled because Johnsons perceptions and fears are so human, just like the rest of us!I suggest this book strongly for all those who want to get a little closer to reality."
5,Sad but true,"AIDS memoirs became a rather popular genre in the 1990s. Geography of the Heart fits well into this genre, yet transcends the majority of these books, largely because of Fenton Johnson's deep, faith based observations and beautiful prose. The book is, of course, sad, yet the prose moves us to an understanding of the meaning of love and the factors which discourage us from entering into this most vulnerable state. It also talks about the deep transformation that occurs when we let down our guard and allows us to love, in spite of risks involved in all relationships. This is challenging as well as encouraging. I found Geography of the Heart to be well worth reading."
5,What is love?,"This heartfelt and heart-warming story of two dissimilar people who find each other . . . for a period, too brief and ended by AIDS. Lest we forget. Beautifully and lovingly told."
4,Two Serious Ladies,"With shrewd wit, candour and a touch of the bizarre, Two Serious Ladies follows the demise into debauchery of two very dissimilar yet equally stodgy women, who aquire a fondness for eccentric personages. Christina Goering - rich, saintly spinster - turns high class call girl, whilst Frieda Copperfield - caught in a respectable, though staid marriage - abandons her husband for Pacifica, a Panamanian prostitute. The restless, autonomous, asexual female seeking self determination independent from men is a poignant theme which Jane Bowles explores with remarkable cleverness, hilarity and ruthless originality.Two Serious Ladies is a marvellous example of Jane Bowles' extraordinary talent as a writer of contemporary fiction - often obscured by her small literary output and the talent of her husband, writer Paul Bowles ... unfortuately so."
2,Useless,"As a work of scholarship whose purpose is to provide an understanding of the the ""...politics of industrial pollution"", this book is nearly useless. The main problems are: 1) undocumented assertions are made in every chapter, 2) terms which are critical to the book, such as ""toxic"" and ""high cancer death rate"", are never defined, and 3) the treatment is anachronistic throughout. It is difficult to believe that authors who make the statement, ""...new classes of disease and damage to the body that are too subtle to even measure"" (p. 296) actually know anything about the subject."
3,Good basic primer,A good basic primer for those wanting to learn more about service to the Orisha and the Obi form of divination.
4,Thoughtful and clearly-written,"In this helpful guide through the questions of God's silence, Jerome Daley leads readers closer to their destiny and calling. Recommended for all who wonder why God is waiting to fulfill their dreams or answer their prayers."
5,loved the premise,"I just love the private school for girls setup of this book. I thought the characters were unique and unusual. Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down."
1,"Product ok, rebate is a trick","My Kworld ATSC tuner works well, although can be a bit fiddly. But don't fall for KWorld's rebates - they invent tricks and unclear procedures to avoid paying up."
5,Watch Out Paul Bunyon,"Hello,I purchased this toy for my girl friends sons birthday. Since then I haven't seen him but, I can HEAR HIM!!<LOL> He took to this toy like a duck to water, sawing everything in sight. Never mind that a twister is on the rampage, a volcano is exploding, a hurricane is looming, nope, so long as he has his trusty Homedepot Chain Saw, the world will be safe!So, what I'm getting at here is, he LOVES this toy!!! So much for the telletubbies in his bed, he now has a NEW sleepy mate that kicks some serious booty. Oh, and one more thing worth mentioning, the saw DOES have an On-Off switch located on the bottom of it so, when YOU need some REST from all the sawing, you can flip the switch and but the saw to sleep.Trust me here, if you have a son that is even REMOTELY interested in power tools(and what boy ain't) then this toy is the right choice and the right price.Ciao!!"
5,My son loves this,"My son got this toy as a gift from some friends of mine. He loves it . He always wants to play with and so far it has taken alot of ruff playing and still looks new. It is also a very loud toy, but well worth the noise to watch my son have fun with it."
4,Love the Chainsaw,"We really like the Home Depot Chainsaw. It is very realistic, maybe even too much so. It is VERY LOUD. My 2 year old loves it along with his Home Depot Workbench and tool set."
5,Fun toy but something about giving a chainsaw to a kid...,"This is a fun toy to play with. I bought it for myself because I needed it for a costume party, I was trying to be Jason from Friday the 13th. The sounds are real, and it's pretty hefty. I would recommend this toy, however there's just something wrong about giving a child a chainsaw to play with, but that's just my opinion"
2,lame,"My son had tons of fun with this toy - for a few hours, then it stopped working - we even put new batteries in. LAME!"
4,Good Starting Point for Economic Investigations,"I never had much use for this text while in school. As with most subjects Senior year, we went too fast to appreciate it. With the years, however, I had cause to appreciate Peters & Timmerhaus. It is packed full of rules-of-thumb for preparations of cost estimates and comparing options. Although it is not the best place to end an economic investigation, it is the best place to start one.If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks."
3,good information said in too many paragraphs,"For an undergraduate chemical engineering student, this book has many useful charts of utility costs, safety indices, etc. About those charts, I can only say good things, because it feels a lot better citing a textbook than citing web pages all the time. The other information in the book is useful, but not presented in a useful way. I cannot read this book word by word. It's too dry. What I would rather read is a bulleted list in each chapter with definitions and examples of things like HAZOP and fault tree analysis. Because really, when I finish my design class and I need to look up information on some design principal, I'm going to want an easy to read bulleted list, not a paragraph. I think this book could have about one third the pages that way, which would make it more readable and useful."
1,Lacks clarity,"The book is verbose, cumbersome, and unclear.Example: The book is inexact with language. For instance, the word income is used in multiple contexts, but is never directly defined in a glossary or otherwise. Income has different meanings in the personal and business spheres, it's unclear what the authors mean (especially in problem statements). Income is one of many words used inconsistently without exacting definition. It's incredibly amateur to omit a glossary (and sometimes even any in-text definition) for the many technical business and engineering terms used throughout the book."
3,Should this text be Regarded like its Predecesors,Classic text has changed with addtion of RonE. West.eq. (14-23a) for friction factor f contradicts eq. (12-4) of the same 5th ed. text. eq. (14-23b) is a little different than eq.(12-5) of the same text.The statistics section has been deleted from the end.Who has prof. West ever worked for besides U.CO?
4,Cool glimpse at Snow's early years,"You shouldn't go into this disc expecting to hear Snow's hits, or even much stylistic similarity to his Nashville years. This is a fascinating look at his early years, when Snow was still a regional performer building up a national reputation in his native Canada. He didn't move down to Nashville until the early 1950s, and before that he was finding his voice up North, having started out as an unabashed Jimmie Rodgers imitator, then skirting the edge of the whole Western-oriented ""singing cowboy"" style.This is a single-disc version of Bear Family's exhaustive look at Snow's early years. (You can also find a more thorough, 4-CD box set that covers the same material...) If you want to hear Snow's hits, there are a zillion other collections that have them, but if you want to find out where Snow, the country superstar, came from, and how he developed his style, then this is an invaluable archival document. It's pretty cool."
4,Great driving music!,Very soothing music while going on cruising drives. This is a replacement from when I got it for free with purchase of a Mercedes.
5,EYE OPENING,"I bought this book years ago and want to buy it again as i lost my first copy. The first time i read it, it totally opened my eyes to behaviors i couldn't explain to myself. It really helped me overcome some fears and improve on so many levels in my life. I highly recommend this book to ANYONE, as it not only helps you understand yourself but also helps you understand others. With understanding of our environment, compassion, humility comes along and peace, love flows again."
2,Too little or too late,"I ordered this book on a recommendation - as a solution. Unfortunately, it was not the right solution for me, though it certainly may be for others. Personally, I find life becoming more and more multi-dimensional and multi-faceted with multitudinous opportunities and challenges. Reducing wounds to five and then pinning body types on certain wounds with certain recipies for healing was just too reduced for my taste. It forced me to identify with all the wounds and all the body types and simply didn't take who I am in 2010 into consideration. But again, maybe it's just me..."
5,Valorous Times,"This book has stories about Cuchulain, Sigurd, and King Arthur & his men of the round table and how Valor was an honorable charactoristic. There are stories of why valor was displayed. This book is full of action, and stories of old that are not widely known. There is beautiful artwork in this book that is captivating. I wanted to share this book with all my friends and family. This is definately one of my favorite books & have read more than once."
5,A wonderful CD,Selections from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is a must have for children and parents alike! This is a wonderful CD at a great price. You will be singing along with these songs for hours and won't be offended by the words. You may even learn from these songs about the amazing story of Joseph. I give it five stars for a great price and great quality music. Buy it today!
4,"Ethno-musicology, sociology, vision quest, love story.","To round out the experience of this auto biographical story, please buy some of the music from the forest recorded by Louis Sarno. You won't regret it."
2,"Great music, dreadful love affair","Begins with a passionate, well-written story about Sarno's move to Africa. Incredible descriptions of Pygmy music. To capture/convey the sound of that music is an achievment. But all the fine qualities of this book become irrelevant about a 1/4 of the way into Song From the Forest when Sarno is smitten by a Pygmy woman. The main focus of the next 3/4 of the book is ridiculous high-school boy-in-love nonsense and drivel: she smiled at me, she didn't smile at me, I think she cares, I don't think she cares. Who cares? Can't believe Houghton Mifflin published this crap."
5,Midori is eloquent and smart,"The psychology, aesthetics and philosophy of erotic power exchange, D/s and S&M. Written with wit, imagination and intelligence. For someone new to BDSM it may help with self-acceptance and confidence. For all levels it may enhance your own understanding of what it is that we do."
3,Who Proofread This Book?,"Midori is a pretty classy lady with a lot of style, and I enjoy her writing quite a bit. In terms of content, this book is fun, informative, and thought-provoking.However, I was very disappointed to find this book peppered with typos. It was terribly distracting, and, for essays that have appeared in print before this book, it seems like these errors should have been caught before the book was published. I hope future printings can eliminate these errors."
1,Avoid this book in your classes,"I just tried to teach a course with this textbook and it was excruciatingly painful. The book is not badly written, but there are so many typographical errors in equations and the problems, that you spend countless extra time either correcting the problem so it can be done, or tossing it out. I hated this. Plus there is no second edition, no erratum, no answer key for the professor, nothing you can use to verify if the author really does mean to have the students solve the problem with these numbers, or if they have made a mistake. I will not use this text book again. Going through the pain of teaching all over again with a new text book will be far less than dealing with this one again."
5,great movie. i know where to get a copy.,"Hi, this is an awesome movie. I'm mainly writing this to tell you that you should be able to find a copy of it on E-bay auctions. This movie rules."
5,More Than Meets the Eye is the best animated movie ever!,"I grew up completely obsessed with the Transformers, like many others. They provided me with role models that lasted throughout my formative years, and I am forever grateful to their creators. I saw The Movie eight times in the theater, but I regretfully never purchased a copy. BRING BACK THE MOVIE - PLEASE! Only now do I fully appreciate its worth, and I can't find a copy anywhere. If anyone has a copy for sale or knows where I can get one, I would be VERY grateful. Hot Rod will never replace Optimus in my heart, but this movie is still a classic and worthy of reproduction!!!"
5,Re Release Transformers the Movie!!!,"I grew up on cartoons like Bugs Bunny, Woody Woodpecker, G.I.Joe, and Transformers. My favorite is Transformers. I followed every episode with anticipation. I was hurt when Optimus Prime died, but Rodimus was a good ""stand-in"", being that NOBODY could replace Optimus Prime. I saw the movie, but I cannot find it anywhere. So if anyone out there knows where I can find the Movie, please let this fan know ASAP!"
5,I NEED this video!,"I remember watching this movie years ago in my friend's Den on his old BETA player. This movie has a kickin' soundtrack full of 80's long-haired hard rock (and even a little Weird Al). Better than He-Man or even the Thundercats (and from me, that's high praise indeed!)."
5,i must have the transformer movie,"This was one of the greatest movies i had ever seen as a kid. I used to have it on tape but it got taped over. Ever since then, I have been frantically searching for a copy of this incredible film. I have longed to see this movie again for so long so if it could be re-released or if someone could give me some information on where i could find a copy, i would be forever grateful."
5,"Enjoyable, detail rich history","The book covers the hotel up to the current renovation. It provided interesting details and photographs. For some there may be too much facts - like the listings of meetings and conventions. I however liked that and found it gave a glimpse of different time. The personal and family history of the builder was new information for me and added to my appreciation of the hotel. If you have every stayed in the Disneyland hotel and wondered about its history and what shaped its development, this is THE book for you."
2,YOU CAN NOT TELL A BOOK BY ITS COVER...,"While it may be an over-all attractive looking book, it has its problems (many of them). First of all, it is over priced. Also, some pictures were selected foolishly and do not depict well what the captions state or what the text delails. Needlessly, many interesting and important historical facts have been omitted from the final text (i.e.: the very first chef for the hotel, the bellboy who began working at the hotel in 1956 and was still there 25 years later, the crash of a hotel helicopter, the leaks that happened the first day that the marina was filled, etc.). [...]"
3,Secrete hand cream,"It is ok. It feels really nice on your skin. I didn't notice the smell of the one I ordered, and it is not one of my favorite scents, but the cream feels good."
2,Why?,"Why, oh why, do companies insist on changing products that are perfect to begin with? I purchased the original hand cream at a kiosk at the mall and it was so wonderful. This new version is extremely perfumed, overpowering really, so if you are sensitive to perfumes you probably won't care for this cream. Very strong aroma. It doesn't seem to soften hands as well as the older version. The old version worked very well. Sure do with they hadn't changed. I will not purchase this product again. Very disappointed."
5,"The sweetness of an acomplished writer, the sting of satire","A Hive for the Honey Bee is an excellent book- and will bring pleasure to all ages. Combining satire and a genuine love of life, the novel explores the life of the honey bee in fine detail- without boring us with unnecessary technicalities. The sort of novel which ought to be a treasured part of your bookshelf."
5,"Wonderful, mysterious","I found this book extremely disturbing, though very good. After I finished reading it, I went back through it again and saw that everything that Daisy said was a prophecy. This really got me thinking- Do workers really drive the drones out of the hive when they're not needed anymore? Belle's death was terribly sad, and even more sad to me is the ""lot"" that worker bees have- Before reading this book, I always considered worker bees lucky because they seemed to run everything. I never realized what a mess the drones make. I recommend this book to people with an understanding of nature, life and death, philosophy, and love. Younger readers would probably have a difficult time understanding the nature of this book's purpose. All in all, it was an excellent book, full of feeling."
1,"""Tight and compelling,"" my arse!","There aren't many books my nine-year-old son and I won't finish, but this was one of them. It's been a long time since I read such a slow, boring book. The characters were nothing but soul-less caricatures, and when one doesn't care about the characters, why go on? I'm astonished that the New York Times and other reviewers gave this such favorable coverage. It just goes to show--they're not reading these books with kids."
3,"A good start, but...","This book got off to a resounding start. Its strange blend of magical realism, esotirism, and a compelling style, as well as some interesting characters, drew me in quickly.But about halfway through the book, I started having one of those ""so what?"" moments. I plodded on for another few chapters, and finally gave up.Perhaps the problem is that Christopher tried to put too much into this book; he tried to have too many talismans, strange characters, weird situations, and it all finally collapsed under its own weight. He's a talented author, though, and I'll look for other books of his. But without any great expectations."
2,Watching and waiting,"The long intricate descriptions eventually got to me, as did the seemingly random New Age mumbojumbo, and I realized I didn't care about any of the characters, and just stopped reading. A real disappointment. It reads like something someone just made up, like a shaggy dog story, and kept going, and going."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"When I first started this, I liked it. The more I read, the less I liked it, and when I finished the book, I realized I didn't like it at all. Too many characters, too much symbolism, and an overly elaborate storyline that was like a jigsaw puzzle... and as passionate. Oh, and why in the world were there vampires in it?! This type of story demands a lighter touch. A book with similar themes (loss, love, fate), Four Letters of Love by Niall Williams, is a good example. When I was about a quarter of the way through this book, I ordered another of Christopher's books called Veronica. Can't say I'm too excited about reading it now."
5,A Happy Fate,"A meditation on fate, destiny and love, complete with spiders, vampires, jazz, ancient artifacts and possibly an extraterrestrial dog. What's it all mean? You got me. But that doesn't matter. A Trip to the Stars is weird, wonderful and absolutely original."
2,A trip to nowhere.,"I really enjoyed Nicholas Christopher's last novel, Veronica, and so I decided to tackle this one. Many of the elements that worked so well in Veronica are also present in ""A Trip to the Stars"": abudant symbolism, strangely magical happenings, and Christopher's direct but highly descriptive writing style. Unfortunately, the result isn't nearly so satisfying.For starters, there is the small matter of the plot....there isn't enough to sustain this book through 500 pages. We follow the lives of the two main characters from the time that one is abducted from the other at the age of 10 until they are reunited 15 years later. In the interim they both live curious and improbable lives, but I just kept asking myself whether I really cared about them. In the end, I decided that I didn't."
3,doesn't do what I wanted it to do,I wanted it to split the sound from one unit to work my DVR and DVD player but it doesn't do it with both plugged in. You have to unplug one for the other one to work.
1,Don't bother,"The premise doesn't work - they stack 2 fibers and then aim them at the other - so they cannot be in line! The centers are off center, it just doesn't work!"
1,Worthless without booster,"Even with premium cables, trying to split one cable into two this device did not work. They sent me a replacement thinking maybe the first was faulty. Both do not work. I regret wasting even so little money. So much for that idea!"
5,Two for One,"When I ran out of digital inputs to my preamp, thought I would give this item a try - using it in reverse as a passive switch, instead of a splitter (probably only mirrors for transmission?). Connected three short (18 inch) toslink cables and hooked up a CD player and HD DVD player (both emit no laser signal when turned off, unlike the set-top box, which always emits a signal, even when in off/standby ). Can't say that all versions of this type of splitter will work in reverse (or work at all - see other reviews) but this one works fine, with almost no loss of detail versus a single toslink connection. Easily worth doing the experiment at a total cost of $6.00, and now I don't have to buy a $50.00 active switch, have to remember to change it, and waste an outlet and electricity."
1,NO GO!,"This pipe dream does not work.It cuts the optical signal too much, just as you would expect.It will not work for me, drops in and out, not at all useful!You are better off converting the optical signal with a low cost converter that changes optical to coax. Optical maximum distance is about 35 feet from my experience and splitting the signal at either the end of this length or the beginning was a total failure either way.It's as cheap as the price indicates...stay away from this poor idea."
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered this fiber optic splitter with the intention of splitting a fiber optic audio feed to two different devices. Did it work? Nope. I could see the light shining through, but neither of the audio devices were able to produce audio from the light that was split off to them.I also tried going the other direction (two different devices going to one audio output), with the intention of using it as a passive switch (as long as only one of the devices was on, it should play sound from that device, but if both devices were on, there would be overlap and the audio stream would be garbled or nonexistent). Did that work? Nope. Sure didn't.So, to summarize, this device is completely useless."
2,Officialy the worst Willis movie I've seen,This is the worst Bruce movie I have seen. I only gave it 2 stars because of some of the good one liners. But I'm not sure if it was possible to swear anymore then what they had the actors swearing. And no I am not offended by swearing. I probably swear more then I should and I can honestly say this movie just might annoy a drunken sailor.
2,Watch with low expectations,It's mildly entertaining but only to the point of being comforting as background noise while you're on the computer.It want's to be an 80's cop movie but lacks the energy of those movies.It's mostly boring and things that look like they should be funny just leave you tired.Meh.
1,Crap Out !!!,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long while. Tracy Jordan is not funny. Just infantile and one of the worst actors currently on the big screen. Bruce Willis must have had one more movie in his contract , cause I just can't see why he would willingly agree to do this film. I didn't buy this film from amazon. I did watch it on HBO.Really , Really , Really sucks."
1,Bu-Ray Review,"One of, if not, the worst movies I've ever seen. What the hell happened here? How could anyone like this movie?"
2,"Skip It, Save Your Money!","As a big fan of Bruce Willis for 25 years, and director Kevin Smith for 16 years, I hoped for movie magic when they teamed up on ""Cop Out"". I was VERY disappointed, though, and the film's biggest problem can be summed up in two words: Tracy Morgan. Unfunny, whining, and constantly mugging at the camera, Morgan may be Willis' worst co-star, ever (How bad is he? Seann William Scott, with less than 10 minutes of screen time, has more laughs than Morgan provides, the entire film). Willis spends most of ""Cop Out"" simply staring at Morgan and his unrelenting stream of chatter (director Smith, apparently, allowed him to ad lib at will).It's supposedly a cop comedy (involving drugs, a kidnapped wife, and a stolen baseball card), and a 'hilarious' send-up of buddy films. It fails at both, and wastes the talents of Willis, Scott, Kevin Pollak, Adam Brody, Jason Lee, Guillermo DÃ­az, and Ana de la Reguera.It simply isn't worth buying...What a mess!"
2,Bruce Willis comedy,"""Cop Out"" is a film that you cannot take seriously. It is a comedy at heart. There is a distinct kind of humor in ""Cop Out"". This is what I call Bruce Willis comedy. Its slick humor which is funny at times, but can get old when used over and over.""Cop Out"" is about two cops James ""Jimmy"" Monroe (Willis) and Paul Hodges (Tracey Morgan). These two cops have been working with each other for a long time. Paul thinks that his wife is seeing another man, while James is being replaced in his family by his ex-wife's new husband.While on the job James and Paul seem to be following trouble wherever they go.Overall, ""Cop Out"" is somewhat funny film that should be entertaining if you understand Bruce Willis humor."
3,Don't buy it,This movie was just not what I thought it was going to be. It took to long to even get into the movie and then the plot dragged on to something that really had nothing to do with the opening movie. I mean really it was like they forced the movie to go together. Tracy Morgan was a babbling bafoon. How do cops end up working for the drug dealer they were originally after? It did have some laughs. I will give it that. The part with the kid left me with mixed feelings. So I say rent the movie don't buy it. You won't be mad if you spend 3.50 to rent the movie and everybody watch it at once but buying the movie is to much money for it even if it is on sale.
3,Trepid...,"As most who view this movie I'm a fan of Kevin Smith (Clerks II is the best) and his style of humor, well he is only a director on this one. So I'm sure he made suggestions as to what would make the movie better it was ultimately ruined by Morgan. He has to be the most unfunniest person ever to grace a movie screen. Honestly Jet Li would've been a better fit for Morgan's role. Sean William Scott was funny in this movie and provided most of the laughs. Honestly when is he going to stop being Stiffler! If you have no other options then by all means it may provide a laugh or two but don't spend money buying it until it ends up in the bargin bin."
3,Mediocre film....solid BD,"Being a big Kevin Smith fan, I bought this sight unseen and was left decidedly nonplussed when it was all over. Kevin's love letter to the 80s action buddy cop flick has its moments, but overall falls rather flat and just feels disappointing for those of us who've admired his work over the years.As far as the disc itself goes, there's very little to complain about. Both the video and audio presentations of the film are very good. The Maximum Movie Mode (or Maximum Comedy Mode) as it's known on the BD is excellent, and (for me anyway) provides more entertainment than the feature. It's one of the very few releases where I actually recommend an extra over the film itself!Unless you're a big Smith fan (like myself), rent it instead."
2,Cop Out,"It does have some funny moments, but I don't see watching it again. I enjoy Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan certainly didn't do bad either, but it just felt like it was straining to make it at times. I realize it is difficult to be funny one moment and have a sensitive side another. I think a little better script and better cast bad guys and it would have done better. Good quality DVD and standard extras. If you enjoyed this catchThe Last Boy Scout.CA Luster"
4,TRACY MORGAN WAS GOOD,"This is not the best Bruce Willis film out there. For Willis fans you might wait for Die Hard 4. He does not play a super-cop, but rather a mediocre cop paired with Tracy Morgan who uses lines from movies to interrogate prisoners.The cops screw up and get suspended from the police force. Willis, in a situation where he wants to pay for his daughter's $48,000 wedding, opts to sell his 1952 gem mint 10 Topps Andy Pafko card for $83,000. While in the card shop he gets robbed. They now try to recover the card, which leads to dealings with criminals. Morgan steals every scene from Willis, who is nothing much more than an overpaid straight man.Willis fans will not enjoy this movie as much as Morgan fans. This is better than another ""Rush Hour"" movie, but don't expect too much. 3 1/2 stars"
2,a missed opportunity,"Honest Abe once said, ""The common man is a fool."" Well,there's no shortage of them giving good reviews here. It reminds me of the formula in Supertroopers. Start off with a reasonably funny scene, stagnate for 45 minutes, inject another funny scene, repeat, end movie. For the most part, people will forget they haven't laughed in over half an hour. For a stout Kevin Smith fan, that formula will fail to impress. I love Tracy Morgan, Bruce Willis, Sean W. Scott and Kevin Pollack but they are all sold up the river to a mediocre script. It's a shame too, this should have been a barnburner, but instead its a wet pile of manure."
2,One of the worst movie I have ever seen.,Nothing more than a few cheap laughs. Not worth the price of admission and definitely not worth the dvd/bluray price.
1,"Rate it an ""F""","This was a horrible movie. The name ""cop out"" says it all it is a cop out for Bruce Willis.. He must be scraping the bottom for movies because this was way below his standards. Tracy Morgan is a horrible actor. The stupid remarks and the lame acting really makes this a bomb. The writer of this story or who ever cast the actors should quit the buisness. I have seen some bad movies but this takes the cake. Thank god I rented it first because this would have gone in the trash. I read the reviews and they were bad, but seeing Bruce Willis was in it I gave it a chance. I WAS SO WRONG INTO SEEING IT-SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE REVIEWS. Sorry Bruce but you need to choose your scripts and you co-actors more wisley. This was not a good movie and Tracy Morgan a not a good actor. Thank god you had all your other blockbusters because this movie could have hurt your career.Had to give it one star but if I had my choice it would not even make it to a minus star. Definite ""F"" rated movie"
1,Worst movie I've seen in my life,"It takes talent, courage, and a stronge belief in yourself to make a good movie. When you have none of these things, you just hide behind a lot of curse words and hope nobody will notice. This was the most offensive movie I have seen in my life. There was cursing every other word. No talent, no courage, and no belief in themselves. No movie."
1,I lasted 29 minutes...,"Tracey Morgan is not an actor, Bruce Willis slept through this one, I can't say it is the worst movie ever because I turned it off after 29 minutes. If someone gave me this movie for free I would pay them $5 to take it back."
1,Worst Movie Bruce Willis Every Made,I just finished watching this movie or should I say suffered through this movie. I love Bruce Willis and I think he is a fabulous actor but this is truly the WORST movie he has every made. Tracy Morgan is NOT funny and neither is Sean William Scott. Don't waste your time or money on this sad piece of wasted film.
1,"Really, REALLY bad film!","Kevin Smith, usually a crack writer, actor and director hiccups badly in this truly awful ""buddy-cop"" movie that stands alone in outstandingly horrible writing. Bruce Willis phoning in his role with Tracy Morgan mugging for the camera. Bad, bad, bad and bad!!"
3,"FUNNY MOVIE, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER",From watching the trailer of this movie I thought it was going to be hilarious. But it wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.
3,Funny...,"I enjoyed it because I like both main actors. Had it's funny moments, but a pretty dumb plot. Was worth the $3.99 48 hour rental from Amazon"
1,"NEGATIVE 100 STARS FOR THIS ONE--Kevin Smith, please retire","First off....Tracey Morgan has never really been funny. The only time he was remotely funny was in ""Crank Yankers"" playing ""SPOONIE LUV""...other than that, this man is completely humorless.He's like the complete opposite of Eddie Murphy, who is ALWAYS funny, no matter what kind of situation you put him in.Bruce Willis only works in a ""comedy"" when the situations and script are funny. I think he's funniest moments are in the film ""Blind Date""..(now THAT was a comedy!!!)As for Kevin Smith...dude...THIS IS NOT YOUR GENRE!!! Stick to what you do..what you KNOW how to do.The one good thing Kevin did here was to hire legendary composer HAROLD FALTERMEYER to write and perform the score!...he's a legend, and he stuck to his 80's roots for the music here."
4,Enjoyable -,"Stars Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan, two longtime NYPD partners on the trail of a rare baseball card taken from Willis. The card ends up in the hands of a Mexican drug lord with an obsession for violence. Unfortunately, the pair are suspended without pay because of a disastrous neighborhood shootout.The plot is a bit long and certainly implausible, but enjoyable nonetheless. The 'good news' is that Willis gets his card back and the two are restored to duty, the 'bad news' is that it no longer has value because Morgan accidentally shot a hole through it."
2,Cop Out,"I am surprised that Bruce Willis even bothered to make this ..Its a stupid movie , Dont waste your money on this .."
5,awesome,this is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time. bruce willis and tracy morgan work very well together.
1,You should probably be removed from the gene pool if you rent this...,Watched this at a friend's house this past weekend. Wow..I actually finished it because I am a Bruce Willis fan and kept HOPING it would get better. It didn't. Complete TRASH....don't waste your time or $ on it.
1,"Smith, Willis and Morgan are funny guys","But this just isn't. The script had been floating around for a long time, and now you know why: it's very mediocre. As is the direction."
2,"""This is police brutality!""","I didn't hate it. I didn't like it either. It was watchable, amiable, uneven, limp, and at times lifeless. Just look at the DVD cover and that pretty much tells you what's going on inside: Bruce looks embarrassed while Tracy looks just plain goofy. It was as if they were starring in two different movies edited together. One was a running monologue of stale jokes; the other wanted to be an actual cop film complete with a case to solve, the obligatory car chase, shootouts, and several executions thrown in for good measure! They literally went from a joke to a man being shot to death. It was more than a little jarring. Was this supposed to be a spoof, a goof, satire, parody, a bad 80's TV show revisited: what? It was none of that and so much less. I actually felt sorry for Bruce Willis.I won't even bring up Seann William Scott's part in all this; but to say he took ""annoying"" to a whole new level.I think we can safely say there won't be a sequel.Not a keeper."
3,Middling,"I understood what Kevin Smith was going for with the 80's cop buddy drama spoof. Some of it I really liked, but enough of it didn't that I can't fully recommend the movie. Bruce Willis is fine with a wry sense of humor playing a character very much like a dozen others he has played over the years. Tracy Morgan plays the same character he always plays whether it is on television or in movies. If you love him it may work for you better, but I really only like Tracy in very limited doses which is why he fits in well on the ensemble of 30 Rock. Seann William Scott was very funny in his small role. The premise is basically every buddy cop picture scrambled into one story and add some humor. I want to also note that Kevin Smith did not write this, he only directed."
1,Danger Ahead! Lousy Movie! (I have tried to warn you),"To say ""Cop Out"" is bad is to underestimate how excrable this movie truly is! I can safely say that ""Cop Out"" is one of the worst movies I ever sat through; and I've sat through some really bad ones. Not only is the pacing poor, the rapport forced, and the acting awful, there ar less laughs in this 'buddy comedy' than there were in ""Julia and Julia.""Bruce Willis merely goes through the motions and looks like he was having second thoughts in merely every scene. Tracy Morgan should be given the 2011 Razzie right now...He's that bad. The plot is a mish-mash of Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch, 48 Hours, and Lethal Weapon. The music has been lifted right out of Fletch and you'll be longing for even one moment as funny as the weakest moment from any of the above named films.Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like it was guaranteed to infect you with the Bubonic Plague."
1,"The combination of Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan, & Kevin Smith does not work","Length:: 5:04 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews ""Cop Out"" starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan and directed by Kevin Smith. Did the latest buddy cop duo flop?[...]"
2,Seriously... ?,"Simply bad. Watched this because I like Bruce Willis and Tracey Morgan, but it was a horrible movie, even from the first scene. A shame."
2,Cop Out,Save your money.This is a bad movie.The acting is poor and the story is stupid.Not well produce as well written.
2,Don't let the talent fool you,"I thought a movie with Bruce Willis could be fun and action-packed. And with Kevin Smith directing, it had to be funny. NOT. It's boring and stupid. The funnier characters were the minor players. And no extras. Don't buy and don't waste renting. Maybe see it when it comes on TV."
3,"Yipee-Ca-Yay...Whoops, Wrong Movie.","Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This film is quite funny, with some hilarious sequences. However, it's not laugh-out-loud funny throughout, but it has some great comic moments. Tracy Morgan is kind of hard to understand at times, but I guess that's because he doesn't enunciate his words properly...or maybe he's just a bad actor. Maybe Denzel Washington would have done a better job than he did. Interesting comedy that's worth a one-time viewing. Rated R for strong language."
3,Meh.,"This is an ok product, I guess. I bought it for my son when he started crawling and being more active, around 6 months old. It was large and bulky and took up a lot of space in our small living room, and he wasn't that interested in it. After a couple of months of him not playing with it, we took it apart and tried to get him interested in the different pieces, but he never cared."
4,Re-living the '80's,"This is a great set, but I think Weird Science should be replaced with a different Brat Pack movie"
5,Really great movies - great collectable case,"I really don't need to comment on the movies... You all know they are great! The hardcovered binder is a great way to store all your favorite brat pack movies. The case is wonderful as it has 4 slips inside for each of the movies/cd. And, if you are careful, you can cut on the backside of the slip covers and create an additional slip for another brat pack movie from your collection."
3,what????,excuse me but... a brat pack collection and no St. Elmo's Fire??????? seriously????? that is just plain ridiculous and stupid....
5,Great Product,I received this as a gift and I love all of the movies and the 8 song CD that comes with the pack is fantastic.
2,disapointing won't play in DVD player,Very happy with the collection but very disappointed when my daughter was not able to watch the movie in our regular DVD player and had to resort to using her laptop. This has never happened with any of the other movies I have ordered in the past.
4,almost perfect,"This is a great set, although the extras are lacking and it would have been perfect if Some Kind of Wonderful was included as well. But the CD is a real catch for all the 80's nuts like me. Cheers."
4,Good Set (If You Don't Already Own the Films),"The infamous double-dip. I previously didn't own these, waiting for some features, which this set definitely has. My advice is that if you already own them, it's not worth it. If you don't, buying them all together in this set is a good deal.My only complaint would be the size of the case. It's too tall to fit on my shelve, but besides that, I've got nothing bad to say."
1,"High School Flashback Collection (Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, & Weird Science)","I also agree with the ""double dip"" fear of the ""Flashback Edition"" on these movies. But, unlike the 1st reviewer's opinion of ""Dealing With It"" I choose not to support the Studio. Re-buying these movies for one cool commentary track on just one movie is a rip off much along the lines of the ""I Love the 80's"" DVD's that were recently released.The only way to stop studios from the ""Double Dip"" is not to purchase these product which are attempts at selling essentially the same product with ""Minor"" differences.Like the 2nd reviewer I actually give this 0 stars for the ""double dipping""!!!"
1,No thanks!!!,"Thanks, but no thanks. I already have these three movies when they were released a couple years ago as The Brat Pack Collection. Amazon makes you give at least 1 star, but I actually give this 0 stars for the ""double dipping""!!!"
4,Great set to have!,"I just wanted to explain that the reason it is Breakfast Club, Wierd Science, and 16 candles - is because they are all UNIVERSAL films. The one question I have though is... Why isn't the new H.S. Reunion edition of ""Three O'clock High"" included? I just find that strange."
2,Could have been better,"I must say that I wasn't satisfied. When I received my package from amazon In the mail, I was very angry. When I opened the package, what I had ordered wasn't in there. I ordered the high school flashback collection with The Breakfast Club, Wierd Science, and Sixteen Candles, but what I got wasnt what I ordered. What I received was The Breakfast Club, two of the exact same Wierd Science DVDs and Sixteen Candles wasn't in there. I got duplicate DVDs instead of all three. So I must say that I probably will never order off of Amazon.com again."
5,An added bonus,"What they do not tell you in the description of this product is that you also get the original soundtrack which was oddly changed since it's original release. The original soundtrack (you would be highly lucky to find in a random garage sale, much less at any record store) contains music that I think defines the eighties. The second soundtrack, and a very disappointing one compared to the first, is still extremely hard to find. I have been looking since I was a teenager myself. I cannot begin to tell you how happy this release makes me."
2,2/3 is Bad.,"As mentioned in my other reviews of the individual movies, both the Breakfast Club and Weird Science have audio remastering problems.In the Breakfast Club, about 62min into the movie, Allison quickly says a few lines of dialogue that is noticeably out of sync to her mouth movements (Dolby soundtrack). Thoughout the movie, I also notice very slight sync problems also.In Weird Science, turn on the English subtitles and about 7m20 in, you will notice that you don't hear Gary saying, ""If there's one thing I know, it's female stats"" (again, Dolby soundtrack)!On the positive side, I didn't notice anything wrong with Sixteen Candles and it is nice to have the original soundtrack back (the VHS changed some of the background music that was playing from the theatrical version).None of the discs come with booklets or features that can be called special."
5,Flashback Collection,"Absolutely amazing for the price! I love these movies and they're really hard to find. When I found this DVD set, I was so excited! Great deal!!"
1,BEHINDERT,"The graphics are very poor and stupid. I don't know a person who would give this software 5 stars (except Ron Pekoe). The Jumbo Jets are way too stupid. I was very disappointed. The cockpits are too small and stupid. The 747 looks like a giant box. Like I said, graphic are too poor. Overall I think there is only one word that could describe this game: behindert"
2,Are these shower caps too small OR is my head too big?,"I was very excited to open the box and see these shower caps were individually wrapped. But, when I went to put one on, it barely fit. And, because it was so tight and a little hair was exposed around my face, it left a ring around the hairline. Very disappointed."
3,great and motivational... but..,"it's great. I switch to raw and able to control my glucose well. from 180 to 100-120I find the simplyraw to be motivating and eye openingI really can't believe it works. (back then... now i do ofcourse)However I think raw for life is not as helpful.once we know that eating raw help, there's other much better resources.I recommend to just get the ""simply raw"" on it's own and save $30 to buy books on raw cooking. Simply will supply you more knowledge and dish choices on your raw cooking adventure. If you like videos to help you cooking, theres few channels is youtube you can follow. Raw cooking people are posting new way to prepare their food daily.stay raw, stay healthy, live longregards,diabetic type2 2009"
5,Good Information For New Songwriters,"I met Pete and Pat Luboff at the Taxi Road Rally in November 2006. I was so impressed with their depth of knowledge of the music business that I bought this book. Glad I did. This book is perfect for a new songwriter like myself. Each chapter represents one of the 88 things. Each chapter is short, very informational, and encouraging. It is an easy read and fun too.Pete and Pat have been in this business a long time and this book is full of experiences they have learned the hard way. Now they are sharing them with the world."
1,Disappointed with the company,"We returned this item in good faith, and were accused of keeping the case for the glasses which is absurd. Unfortunately, I will not do business on Amazon because of this."
3,Wurst Catherine Clark Novel?,"A sequel to ""Truth or Dairy,"" ""Wurst Case Scenario"" is engaging, but a little bit depressing. Terribly unrealistic (something catastrophic just HAS to happen on every page?) and full of things people just shouldn't do (they wonder why they end up doing stupid things after having several beers... hmmm). A page-turner, and definitely a want-to-read after Clark's previous novel. I wouldn't buy it, which is why I borrowed it from the library, and I'm glad I did."
2,Disappointed.....,"It was a good book. Some laughs of course. But the book leaves you feeling empty at the end with Courtney and Grant breaking up. I hope there's another book where Grant and Courtney get back together. THE FIRST ONE WAS SOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER, MAKE SURE TO BUY AND READ TRUTH OR DAIRY!!!!!"
2,don't even bother,"Even after hearing bad reviews beforehand, I thought I would give it a shot since I loved the first book. But, the truth is, this book is boring, the characters are boring and the entire time all Cortney does is complain.Don't waste your time, I could hardly even finish this, and I usually love all books.....poorly done :("
3,Not the best but not the Wurst...,"I just finished reading ""Wurst Case Scenario"" but made the mistake of reading it before reading the prequel ""Truth or Dairy"". At first I was a bit confused by the characters and events/places she mentioned in passing, but, I did get to understand what/whom she was talking about by the end of the book. This book is written in diary form and it provides a complete ""what not to do in a long distance relationship manual"" ""Wurst Case Scenario"" is a hilarious book with a new crisis every page. Even though Courtney is quite a bit older than I am, I was still able to relate to her problems. I think it will appeal to all teenagers, both big and small. This book is funny and a page turner... it is by no means the best book around, but it's not the wurst either..."
3,"Ok, but not as great as the first","After reading Truth or Diary I was expecting Wurst Case Scenario to be a lot better than it actually was. Although the ending was disappointing, anyone looking for an ok read with find this enjoyable."
1,breaks easily - rip off,"We received this item as a gift. It is difficult to attach to a crib with thicker bars. The turning mechanism lurches in a very 'un-lullaby' fashion. The toys that hang are very precarious, because they are not held on to the mobile securely. Sometimes they fell off. We ended up just using the music part, leaving it on a table beside the crib.We DID buy the fantastic STIM-MOBILE, which is half the price and more interesting for the baby."
3,Love it but it broke before it could be used,"I was so excited when I got it - I set it up immediately even though I was still pregnant with my son. Unfortunately something happened and the arm snapped from the base. Mobile is worthless, but it still plays music. Pretty sad that my son didn't get a chance to appreciate it."
1,the un-mobile mobile,"This is the second time I have been burned by this product,the first one you had to finesse the mobile attachment in order to make it work and constantly fuss with it to keep it working and the second one refused to work at all straight out of the box. All in all it was more work taking care of the mobile than it was our baby."
3,Dixieland Praise,"I was disappointed in the CD because I thought it was a collection of Bob Snyder and the Grand Hotel Orchestra's version of Amazing Grace, Just A Closer Walk with Thee and In the Garden. That is whate I am really looking for. The music on the CD is fine if you enjoy a lot of Dixieland style of music."
5,Replacement for old aluminum unit,"I ordered this pressure cooker and in just a few days, it arrived.I like the absence of the old pressure jiggler on the lid and the stainless construction is very easy to clean.When you have a mixture of vegetables, the largest must be cooked first and the softest (such as squash) added last for the least time to avoid creating mush. The steam release makes it very easy to interrupt and resume the cooking cycle."
4,Great for cooking & canning,"I'd been looking to do some canning and got this as a gift...PROSIt's easy to use with a simple pressure indicator and lid lock.The nonstick surface inside has been a cinch to clean after cooking!I've canned quart jars, although I'm not sure if quarts are ""recommended""CONSThe handle on the main pot is only attached with one screw...no matter how much I tighten the screw down, it seems as though the handle comes slightly loose when dumping an entire pot of liquid (like after canning). This hasn't affected the functionality of the pot, but it did scare me the first time I tried to dump the water out (the pot is very heavy when filled, and although the handle only gave slightly, it still was an ""oh!"" moment!)All in all, a very good product, and the included cookbook gives you a nice start on some basic recipes for the pot."
5,Works exactly as promised,"This cooker is EXCELLENT. Easy to use, cleans up well, and intuitive. Very highly recommended!!"
1,"Be careful, the lid jams very easily","Fagor makes a big deal about their safety and design, but they don't mention how very very difficult it is to use. The lid got stuck going the wrong way the first time we used it and before cooking even began. The handle broke when we tried to remove the lid. The company said I should have called customer service, but they were closed. No apology was offered. Their explanation is that the lid must be perfectly aligned or it will jam. No mention of this in the booklet, or explanation of what to do if the lid jams."
1,Shattered handle in a sealed box!,"Stopped at Macy's to take a look at this. The sales clerk opened a sealed box to reveal a SHATTERED handle. Buyer beware. Seems awful.Compared to other pressure cookers, the design of the large handle on this one seems to be inherently easy to break.Also note that a 6-quart cooker is too small for most uses. Remember, you can only fill half-way with soup, and a piece of meat cannot extend higher than 3/4 the height of the cooker. Check out the Presto 8 quart that costs about 25% less and includes excellent customer service. Just my 2 cents!"
1,Wish I knew,"The pressure cooker arrived broken. It was returned and I was told that Amazon would no longer carry it. Amazon's response was quick, but I still don't have a pressure cooker."
2,Arrived Damaged,"I really wanted to get into pressure-cooking, but unfortunately this product arrived damaged, so I returned it. I'll simply continue to do my slow-cooking either in a dutch oven or crock pot."
4,Fagor 10 qt. Pressure Cooker satisfactory,Fagor 10 qt. Pressure Cooker is satisfactoryFagor 918060251 Duo Pressure Cooker 10-qt.
5,Not your old fashioned pressure cooker,"Purchased this specifically for canning on my induction stove top and used it for practice on a simle asparagus soup recipe. Easy and very tasty! I was apprehensive about using a potentially dangerous cooking implement, I even had to stop the process and add an ingredient. My only suggestion to any newbie checking out pressure cookers is to be sure you know which way the steam is going to escape..take care to aim away from any surface that might be injured by steam! I found it easy to clean-remember to oil the gasket for good seal and long seal life."
1,Broken in transit.,The handle on this pressure cooker was broken in transit. I did not remove from box since the broken piece was laying in plain sight when opened. Returned.
3,Defective,"I bought this as a birthday present for my mom because she needed a new and better. This model had excellent reviews. She used it once and it was perfect. The last two times she's used it, it would not build pressure. We checked and it was not over or under full. This is a real bummer since it was a present. It appears I've passed the window for Amazon to help. Total let down!"
2,Melted sensor after 5 month's use,"I thought this pressure cooker would last me years. How disappointing to have the orange indicator just disappear yesterday and smell burning plastic! I bought this in October of 2011, and now I'm having to find another brand. It leaked under the handle where it attaches to the top of the pan since I bought it, but once it reached pressure it was fine, I just kept a towel handy and cleaned up the mess, but yesterday I realized that it was taking too long to come to pressure, so when I checked on it - the orange indicator was gone! I took the pot out on the deck till it cooled down. Will mail just the pot cover back to Amazon, to save postage, and look for another one that hopefully will work for a few years at least."
4,Takes a little getting used to....,You definitely have to read the instructions before cooking in this. I have an electric stove and so making adjustments for the heat took a little work but has been easy enough to figure out. The pot conducts heat extremely well. I've started using it for non-pressure cooked food as well. It heats up quicker then my other pots.
1,Deep cut in gasket after just one use,"After just one use the gasket shows a deep cut on the edge, almost a quarter inch deep. This is totally unacceptable. To add insult to injury, this item's price jumped more than $10 just before I checked out. How's that for playing price roulette. I have deserted eBay because of that and now I find the same yo yo-ing at Amazon."
1,Fagor 8 qt pressure cooker,"Cannot get it to pressurize, tried twice, steam escaped from around handle. Fagor hasn't answered my questions. Will return to Amazon for credit."
1,The box said Fagor but not the cooker,"I ordered theFagor Professional Duo 10-qt. Pressure Cooker and Cannerand was really looking forward to getting it as it had stellar reviews. The box was for exactly what I ordered but lurking inside was a Chinese made Kitchen Essentials cooker with a non-stick surface. I notified Amazon of this anomaly and they happily exchanged the product for a true Fagor product. Alas, the same thing happened the second time. I won't use non-stick and returned the second cooker too. I suppose Amazon cannot be faulted if Fagor is hiding inferior products in their boxes but it would have saved everyone a lot of grief if someone at the warehouse could have looked inside to see if the Fagor box contained an actual Fagor cooker or an imposter. I still would like to receive what I ordered but am afraid the result would be similar."
1,Arrived with broken handle and Made in China,"My 10 quart Fagor Duo arrived today on Halloween. I opened the outer Amazon box to retrieve the inner Fagor box and I immediately hear stuff sliding around inside. I opened the box up and the lower handle is broken off and little grainy pieces of plastic are everywhere in the bottom of the box. I will be returning this item for sure for a refund. The box does say ""Made in China"". I would not trust the websites that say it is made in Spain."
2,Product has packaging problem,The first order was as a Christmad gift for my son. when opening the package he found the pressure cooker had a broken handle. I had that one replaced and a second one shipped to him. Upon opening the package this one had a broken handle as well. Obviously there is a fundamental problem with the packaging.
2,Shipping was FAST but came broken,Got my pressure cooker sooner than what the email said which was nice. I checked the cooker because it was a Christmas gift. The lower handle was broken off. I emailed the seller and was told I had to contact Fagor directly for parts. I called them and they had NO problem just sending me parts free of charge. Got the lower handle 2 weeks later and installed it. Tried to use it and the upper handle is broken internally. Called Fagor again and again they are just sending me parts. I am still waiting for those parts and I bought it a month ago. I wish now I just would have bought it in store and not online.
3,pressure cooker,"this product has a steam leak on the top of lid where the handle is mounted, you have to be very carefull not to burn yourself when in use."
5,Best Pressure cooker I've ever owned,This is the best pressure cooker I've ever owned. This just takes 2 minutes to cook rice and takes about 5 to 10 minutes to cook Lentils. I use this atleast 2 to 3 times a day. Awesome product. Delivered on time.
5,essential in my kitchen,"I've had this Fagor pressure cooker for over 3 years and use it frequently for cooking, only once for canning. It is extremely well made and has been a star performer. As my first pressure cooker, there was a little bit of a learning curve. It also requires a bit of wrangling since it is a large capacity and the stainless steel makes it heavy. I have a smaller off brand aluminum one with a rocker gauge but it cooks unevenly and I always drag this one out instead. If you are a serious cook, get the Fagor in this 10 qt size or a smaller size. I purchased one for my daughter who is in culinary school."
5,Great Pressure Cooker,"This 8 Qt Pressure Cooker is great. I was concerned at first about getting a cooker that uses a hotplate as opposed to electric. Having read the directions though, it worked perfectly with complete satisfaction. At first I had a problem with the seal, but thats because I didn't take the seal it out and oil it with vegtable oil, as the directions ask. I'm glad I bought this, and it is the 8 qt is the perfect size. I recommend it."
4,Fagor Duo Stainless,"I'm writing this after using the pressure cooker for more than a month. We have used presure cookers for ever and we know what to expect.Here are the good parts:1. Excellent build quality2. Cooks faster than other pressure cookers we've used so far3. Seems more safe than ordinary pressure cookersThe only negative that we felt was that it is NOT Dishwasher safe. You have to clean it by hand. This is a big deal for us since we use it 3/4 times a week.Yes, even though the price is high, this pressure cooker is worth it."
4,6-Quart Pressure Cooker,Because there is no noise such as on our old pressure cooker with a weight that bounced up and down when pressure was up. I find it difficult watching for the tiny indicator to pop up to indicate full pressure. I am 88 years old.
3,don't be fooled,"I'm new to pressure cooking and was excited to start learning. The product is a good quality stainless steel and I have used it 3 times and am thrilled with the meals I have created and the relative ease of learning how to pressure cook. HOWEVER, I am less than thrilled that this product was MADE IN CHINA NOT SPAIN as amazon advertises. I was very tempted to return it as soon as I saw the country of origin on the box, but since the quality looked good decided to keep it. Hope in the long run I will not kick myself!!!"
3,Fargo Pressure Cooker,This seems to work fine but it takes too long to get up to pressure and the indicator that it is up to pressure and start timing the cooking is too difficult to accurately determine (steam being released at valve.)
1,"If you like pea soup, come on over.","However you will have to scrape it off the walls. The pressure release on the lid worked on only occasionally. One of the times it did not was yesterday, when the whole contraption blew up. If you need more persuasion, I'll note that I had to replace a torn gasket the first week I had it. If you're still not sure, you are one stubborn dude."
2,"Good product, warranty is a lie","Good product but the ""10-year warranty"" listed on this product only applies to the stainless steel part. The plastic parts are not covered by the warranty and are poorly made. Replacement parts are available from the manufacturer's website, but with shipping, costs $20 each. I've had to replace the handle and the pressure valve. The manufacturer's poor attitude and difficulty that I've had reaching them leads me to recommend a stainless steel pressure cooker from a different manufacturer, one that stands behind their products better."
1,Mine cracked after 5th use,"I put this on my Amazon wish list for Christmas and a family member got it for me, I used it 4 times and loved it, then after the last use (ham and bean soup) we heard a metalic noise come from the kitchen a few times in the evening (the soup was done at 11:30 AM) and we could not figure out where it was comming from, then the next day I notived ithad cracked around the upper rim in 3 places opposite the handle. It was stone cold when this happened, strangest thing I have ever seen.I suppose I am SOL since I have no receipt and it sounds like Fagor's customer service is next to nothing. I will give it a shot tomorrow and report back if thye do anything for me, otherwise it came to $20 per use!"
1,It may explode,"This item is extremely dangerous!!! After merely one month use, the pressure cooker exploded this morning. It was cooking 1-cup of congee. When the steam just came out for a few seconds, suddenly, BOOM, the cover flied away and the pot jumped to floor. Rice was scattered everywhere in kitchen. I checked the lid. Its built-in safety mechanism to prevent explosion didn't work at all. Fortunately, no one was hurt. This is my third pressure cooker and is the only that exploded!"
1,Defective Handle,"Shortly after removing the pot from the box, I started washing it. When I lifted the empty, brand-spanking new pot, the handle shattered from the base. I notice others have had this experience. This seems to be a very dangerous problem."
1,Base handle broken at first use.,Base handle broken at first use.Initially ACE denied the refund but after Amazon mediation they accepted to refund the item but not the 2 ways shipping cost (about $30).No comment.
1,Fagor Duo 8-Quart Pressure Cooker,"The Fagor Duo 8-Quart Pressure Cooker blew up in my kitchen next to me and my wife while we were cooking. It was only 6 months old. The pressure cooker blew up before the yellow indicator marked that it was finished. It destroyed the surrounding ceiling and cabinets. When I sent the lid to the manufacturers in NJ, they told me it was my fault. They acted very defensive and charged me to get the pot fixed."
4,not big enough for corn on the cob,"The pressure works great in getting up to pressure quickly and love the safety features built in, but the overall diameter is not big enough for cooking corn on the cob."
1,This product is not made in Spain as described,"Bought this item specifically because it was advertised as made in Spain and not China. However, when the product arrived the box had made in China printed on it. The Fagor Futuro line is still made in Spain if you're looking to by a product made in Spain."
3,Received with broken support grip,"I too received the 8qt Fagor duo with a broken support grip. It would be so easy for Fagor to add a protective support on that side of the cooker. Also there was no ""anti-crush"" packaging on that side between the Fagor box and the shipping box. Talked to a real person at Amazon (very nice) and they will send a replacement overnight. Let's hope it comes unbroken."
3,Great but Beware!,"I LOVE pressure-cooking and have been using one for years. However, this particular brand has now blown up on me 3 times in 18 months. I thought at first I had done something wrong, so I researched the owner's manual. The second time I found a piece of chicken in the release valve which wasn't in there initially, because I am careful to check it before I start. Yesterday, I was cooking a beef roast, and it blew up again. I never set it on the highest level of pressure - always on number 1, and never higher than MEDIUM on the electric stove. It had only been cooking 45 minutes when it blew. I am now looking for another brand. Luckily no one, or my dogs were near the stove when it blew up."
1,"Broken Handle on mine, too","ALSO received one with a broken handle, teflon coated. Unlike other people, though, I went straight to Fagor's customer service department and was surprised that they declined to replace the handle."
1,Broken handle!,"UPS did a nice job delivering this Fagor product as the box was in pristine condition, which leads me to believe the manufacturer did not catch the poor quality of the handle before it left their plant, only to shatter inside the box during shipment. I printed out the replacement forms and Amazon has already shipped the replacement (UPS hasn't even picked up the defected product yet)! Amazon's customer service so far has been stellar! I may return the replacement if I feel the handle or the gasket is questionable as we definately do not want supper on the ceiling. I opted for the Fagor because of the fabulous reviews, but this will be the second one posted about a shattered handle. Perhaps Fagor needs to rethink having China make their products instead of Spain. Kuhn Rikon (Swiss made, high quality, high price) may end up getting my money instead of Fagor. I am disappointed in Fagor's lack of quality control."
3,Item was used not new,"Received item quickly but upon opening you could tell the item had been used and the box was opened. It was listed as ""new in box"" There were still a few stuck food particles on the inside of the pot and it had water marks up the sides and blue marks on the bottom from being put on too high a heat which happens with stainless steel. I'm keeping the item but was disappointed with the price as it was not as advertised.Fagor Duo Stainless-Steel 6-Quart Pressure Cooker"
1,Hunk of junk,"This is probably the most poorly made hunk of junk I have ever owned. Handle snapped off 3rd time I used it. I had to purchase replacement parts eventhough it was only about 6 months old. Then, the pressure valve broke after 2 more uses. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Go with any other brand please."
1,Plastic Handle Crumbles,I had to return this product; part of the plastic handle was missing. The material with which the handle is made is absolutely not worth your buy and it seems to crumble easily.
4,My new favorite pan.,"This is a well build unit, the only reason i didn't rate it five stars is the basket. I use this pan to process small batches hot peppers (canning) among the other traditional uses. The basket is too limiting for space, but i still needed something to keep the jars off the bottom of the pan. Found a small aluminum rack that works fine, haven't needed the basket for anything yet. Not a cheap date, but good quality overall."
5,Pressure cooker / canner,This is a great product! Does all it claims with complete safety devises built in the unit.I would recommend this to anyone interested in this type of unit!Why cook any other way??
5,Great cooker,"What a great pressure cooker. Much easier to use than i expected..My first meal , stuffed peppers, was done in 15 min"
4,Cooker,"My daughter said she really likes it, it cooks great and the size is good. I would say buy this."
1,"Handle broke after 3 months, and customer service refused to help","We bought the Fagor Duo 10-Quart pressure cooker, and it worked great. After only 3 months, however, the metal part that attached the handle to the pot broke off. It looks like it was welded on, but only in a few small spots. We sent an email to customer service at Fagor, and Jennie Ramos from Fagor customer service wanted us to buy another handle because ""handles, pressure values, and gaskets are not covered under the warranty""! It's not even possible for attach a new handle to it because the metal part, which technically is part of the body, came off! I've replied to her with pictures of this and describing the problem, and so far I've gotten no reply. I think once they get your money they don't care about their customers, and they don't stand behind their products.The functionality is good, but can't say the same about the build quality. If it breaks, don't expect Fagor to help you."
1,Brand new handle shattered when lifting pot half full with boiling water,"I first tried my dream pot last night. The Fagor Duo handle shattered when I tried to lift the pot half filled with just boiled water and beans off the electric coil. Luckily it shattered immediately and not when I had the pot over the floor where I would have received major burns.This handle design or brittle plastic needs to be changed. Until then, the pot needs to be recalled."
1,Why is this pressure cooker linked to the Duo??,"If you do a Google search for the Fagor Duo, this link to Amazon comes up with a pressure cooker, not the Duo model. The picture is the dull surface and the steam vent release button is the dark mustard color. The Duo's pictures are shiny silver and the button bright yellow. If you search from Amazon for the Duo, you will find it is $109, not in the $80 range as this one is (7/2011). This probably explains the bad reviews for the Cook's Essential line that comes in a Duo box. So Amazon, why are you not stating that this model is NOT a Duo and why is it linked through internet searches as a Duo?"
1,"poor quality, lousy/nonexistent customer service","The first Fagor Duo I purchased in 2009 was and still is great - no problems. But in Feb 2011 I bought another Duo from Macy's, and needed to return it because lid wouldn't lock into place. The replacement Duo has had lid-locking trouble as well, followed by, when 3 months' new, the screw holding the handle onto the pot continually getting loose but becoming stripped so that the pot/handle cannot be repaired. With my repeated calls and emails to Fagor customer service to get the pot repaired or replaced, I was discouraged by their slow and impersonal response; if they replied at all, it was with a cryptic one-line instruction and web-link to watch their long and complicated video on how to repair the pot myself! Finally gave up and returned the pot to store for a refund."
4,Good Cooker,"Pros:-does the job (pressure cooks)-does not make a mess, pressurizes correctly and releases correctly as well-relatively quiet-makes great stews!Cons:-The top of the lid has discolored over time. I've tried to clean it with different types of detergents and vinegar, but it seems like the metal lid has oxidized. There's now a weird swirly metal pattern on the top instead of the usual shine.-Can be tricky to lock in--just make sure you practice it and that it is locked in entirely before you start cooking!"
4,Origin: China??,"I have read all the reviews on using Fagors as pressure CANNERS. However, I just happened to glance at the origin of this Duo and it says China! I know Fagor is from Spain isn't it? Why is this one from China?Material: 18/10 Stainless SteelCapacity: 10-qt.Origin: ChinaCleaning & Care: Handwash with Mild CleanserWarranty: 10 Years"
4,Good pressure cooker,"This is a very good pressure cooker, it is one of my favorite cooking devices I have. Easy to take apart to clean (whole thing in dishwasher) and works well. I would recommend this item."
4,Money well spent,I had a T-fal pressure cooker for almost 10 years and was skeptical of any other brands. My first experience with Fagor has been wonderful. Very easy to handle and excellent results. I am looking forward to enjoying this for at least as long as my T-Fal.
1,arrived broken - poorly made - sent it back,"I spent a lot of time reading reviews on Amazon and decided on the Fagor Duo, despite some reviews about quality problems. I was excited when it arrived since this was my first time buying a pressure cooker and I couldn't wait to try it. So I was really bummed when I opened the box and the shorter handle was broken off and in two pieces, even though the pressure cooker had been packed with styrofoam. I took that to be a sign of being poorly made, and remembered the reviews that complained that the handles seemed cheaply made. Of all the things you would want strong handles on it's a pressure cooker! I took it as a sign of worse things to come so I just sent it back. I didn't have problems with the return, but I am very irritated that I wasted time buying the Fagor Duo, had to find the time to return it, and instead of enjoying using my pressure cooker I am back to researching again to decide on another brand to try, sigh...."
4,New to pressure cooking,"I bought this for myself for Christmas.After researching about 4-5 brands - Kuhn Rikon, Chef's Design, Fissler and Fagor and its many styles, I chose the Duo-6 Qt.I was a little timid at first, not understanding the importance of getting the food cooking on high and then turning it down to medium heat. Once I got the technique down, I have been creating my own recipes and feeling more confident.I am delighted with the Fagor and look forward to using it for many years to come."
2,Really diffucult Pressure Cooker,I picked this pressure cooker because it had such high quality ratings but I have had a lot of diffuculty using it and it's really hard to clean. I got rid of my old pressure cooker because it had a non-stick coating and it was starting to wear off and seemed to be holding some of the food odors from past meals. I'm sorry I got rid of it because this has proved not very good. It seems to take longer to cook things in and yet it burns foods too. I don't know if I got a bad one or it's not the quality it's hyped to be but I would not reccomend it to anyone.
4,Great product,"The product was wonderful! The packaging can be improved though--the first time it arrived, a piece was broken. The second time was fine...but with the flimsy packaging, it's easy to see how it can break during shipping."
2,I can't get things to NOT burn in this,"Everything I make burns in this pot. I had an electric pressure cooker before that died after I had it for a few years. It worked beautifully. It took a little longer to pressurize than the stove-top Fagor Duo, but nothing burned in it. My Fagor, on the other hand, burns everything! The only thing that doesn't burn is water. Occasionally I like to cook food in something besides water, but if I want to do that I have to use my oven and do it the old fashioned way. Very frustrating! I do not cook it on too high of a temperature. I keep it barely pressurized during the cooking time and things still burn. If any of you have recommendations on this, I'd appreciate it. I think, in the meantime, I'll re-purchase my old electric cooker."
1,Praxis II Social Science High School by Jeanne Armstead,"I just completed the Praxis Social Studies Content Exam - High School (4/20/02). This book has a lot of information, however of the 130 questions on the test, I doubt that this book contained pertainent information on 3 questions ( and I think that is a high estimate). The best I can say about this book is, see whats in it and you know what IS NOT on the Praxis test."
3,Compact and works fairly well,"This antenna works better than the 300-ohm twin lead antenna it replaced. Reception is still marginal in this rural setting. The antenna is small and unobtrusive (if it were white, it would be better). I stood it in a bookcase."
5,profiles featuring billy ray cyrus,This was a very interesting dvd I loved it there should be more like it keep up the good work billy ray
5,An important book everyone should read.,"I went to a health retreat with my wife over the break between Christmas and New Years and we were given a copy of this book. It was referred to a lot in one of the seminars. I was amazed at how detailed and indepth the book was. We were also given a course on Neurosync behavior modification which reinforces many points in this book. Given that psychologists put together the Neurosync software, that made me even more impressed with Stealth Health. I highly recommend you buy it."
2,As deep as a magazine article,"I think the premise of this book is interesting - reflecting who you are by the tastes you prefer....the psychology of personality, the power of smell in memory and in attraction. The chapter titles enticed me (but it all seems to be advertising, with no depth) -- the writing and the information imparted in this book is no deeper than a magazine article. The book is probably worth paging through for fifteen minutes...you will catch all the information you need -- and will ever get from it -- that way."
4,Great book and price,The book ordered was in great condition and such a great price. Shipping was a piece of cake and quick.
1,Utterly Riduculous,"Thankfully I did not pay any money for this book. My airhead roommate, who counts taking online quizzes as one of her hobbies, owns it. Unsurprisingly, it was dead wrong on every question, probably because there is absolutely no scientific basis behind it. The only thing your favorite foods reveal is -- *gasp!* -- what you like to eat, and possibly how you were raised. If you enjoy taking those banal quizzes in magazines, and are surprised by how ""accurate"" they are, by all means read this book. But for everyone else, save your time."
1,"this is only 50 cups, one sleeve of cups this seller has false information in the description.","This is for 50 cups not 20 sleeves of 50 cups each. It cost me 22.12 to receive 150 red plastic cups, I have never been so upset about an order from Amazon."
3,Beautiful piano jazz,"This albums's 20 years old now, but it still sounds as fresh and original as anything being released today. Bradley Williams is a first-rate piano player, and his band is tight and highly skilled. It's very difficult to develop an utterly unique sound within the confines of the standard piano-bass-drums format, and they haven't, but this is still a fine album of well-played piano jazz."
2,Lack of in-depth explanation,"This book is too brief, only explain how-to things. The book will not teach you why you need to do a certain thing. Many copy-paste and typos.....!!!"
2,Not easy for me to follow,"I had been a Solaris Administrator 1-1/2 years prior to purchasing this book, And even with experience with other UNIX variants, I found this book difficult to follow. So far, I haven't really gotten my money's worth from it."
1,A very bad book,"This book is poorly written, it contains too much unnecessary info and very little coverage of concepts. No depth in the chapters.Even the commands are not properly covered. I regret buying this book and I am looking for other books"
1,Way too simple,"The majority of the information in this book is pretty basic and is already covered in any basic UNIX text. Anyone who doesn't know most of what is in the first half of the book has no business having root access to begin with. Seriously, if you don't know how to use cp, ls or man commands (all discussed in the book) you aren't ready to be a UNIX sysadmin. The bottom line is that if you have been a sysadmin for more than two months this book isn't much use. I guess all the good stuff is discussed in the *advanced* system administrators guide but I was so disappointed in this book that I won't bother getting it."
2,man page reprints,There was absolutely nothing in this book that I did not already know by heart and little that couldn't be discovered by reading a few man pages.
4,Great accessory for great router,"Works great for edge routing pieces with bits that don't have guide bushings as well as for routing details (grooves, dados, etc) parallel to the edge of a workpiece.Specs: The rods are about 9 1/2"" long, so the max distance between fence edge and bit center is about 7 1/2"" (when used with RF1101). The semicircular opening in the fence face is 1 5/8"" in diameter, and the fence face is 4 1/2"" wide. The guide face has holes in it to facilitate the addition of a longer wooden fence board to provide additional stability.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because no screws are supplied to attache the guide rods to the router base (my RF1101 router kit did not include them).Well built and solid piece of equipment and a valuable addition to my router set!"
2,Malpractice on paper,"I purchased the 3rd edition, but I can only assume the 2nd was no better. This book was literally filled with mistakes. The authors thoughtfully provided a disclaimer in the introduction that the content was not to be considered as practice guidelines. This proved true as many of the entries were not only outdated, but many times wrong. Following their recommendations would lead to malpractice. The only value of this book is stimulating you to recognize their many mistakes. This book is not worth the paper it's printed on and obviously reflects that the editors either had no time to actually proof-read the material or don't know how to practice medicine in this or the last century."
5,A true surprise,Begbie skillfully deals with a much neglected topic. He draws in the reader and expands the way one looks at both theology and music.
2,Not so good!!,"Bought this thinking I would mix it in with my more expensive bird seed to make it go a little farther..My little feathery friends are pretty smart, they don't seem to like it, so I still have half a bag sitting in my garage.It is more of a yellow millet instead of the plump white."
5,excellent deal,"Quality is superb, millet is hulled, price is way below market, shipping is fast and free, NEVER had a better deal, I am coming back for more and my wild bird friends are very happy too."
1,They didn't even try to fill the order.,"I ordered white millet. Instead I got a bag that said: ""hulled millet."" This is a complete rip-off. I am returning the bag and I suggest no one order this item. Misrepresentation!!!!!!!!!"
2,not what I thought,"Shipping was quick on the product. The seed is not what I thought white millet was, this is like parakeet seed. Guineas aren't real crazy about it either."
4,Guineas Love White Millet -- price is good.,"My guineas love white millet and my old supplier went out of business. So this is great, delivered to my door and the price is pretty good."
1,The ending ruins it,"If you are a Washingtonian who hangs around galleries, etc. then you'll recognize a lot of names in this book, and that may make it fun. But most of the time the story really drags and it takes some prodigious leaps to actually swallow some of the scenes described. The worst is the ending, which is a very deflating experience. Definately not one of her best."
2,Not Margaret Truman's best,"I'm a fan of Margaret Truman, but I found it laborious to get through this one. I found most of the characters shallow and totally unlikeable. The ending was absurd. Even Annabelle and Mac can't make this one worthwhile!"
2,Tired and Trite... Overweight Readers Beware!,"I have enjoyed Truman's mysteries in the past, but found this one contrived, mildly entertaining, and significantly irritating. The characterizations seemed melodramatic and/or stereotypical. Not a total loss, but you can do much better for your book-buying buck.What I really found offensive in this book was the consistent characterization of every overweight character as disgusting, repellent, absurd, etc. Apparently, in Truman's mind fat equals bad and thin equals good. How sad for the overweight reader who picks up this book to escape from the unkindness of the world he/she inhabits, only to be bashed by Truman's obvious prejudice. Shame on you, Margaret."
4,Devin does Dazzle,"Unlike so many others, I really enjoyed this album very much. I know it's different from his last release, and it does definitely have an eighties sound (his sound has always been retro!) I think this album is the most POP he's ever gone, with exception to mixing pop artists singles of course!If you liked his other releases, you might still enjoy this one. If he were to make an identical replica of ""kittenz"" his fans would most likely have ripped him a new one. There is no winning with fickle ""fans"" of music. This album sounds like an obvious progression for this artist. The songs are fun!Highlights (for me, anyhow)RocketRideReady2WearEveryone is someone in LAWatching Cars Go ByThe last one has tired female robot vocals a la ""Satisfaction"" by that Benny Benassi (spelling?) dude. But it's lyrical content saves it. Amusing. Ready2Wear is true Felix, the best track here. Love it."
3,well....,"It's ok. The production is fine, but the beats lack the strength that productions like I Com by Miss Kittin have. I'm not really enjoying this one as much as Kittens and Thee Glitz or A Bugged Out Mix, but if you want to collect all Felix's CD's, this one must be there. Beautiful cover, very poppy style, back to the 70's or early 80's design."
3,Felix Da Housecat - Devin Dazzle & The Neon Fever,"While not as charming as KITTENZ AND THEE GLITZ, Felix da Housecat's follow-up DEVIN DAZZLE & THE NEON FEVER delves even more into the 80s music, particularly New Wave. Lyrics from The Neon Fever have a strong, rhythmical power to their shout. ""Short Skirts"" is humorously sexy, while ""Hunting Season"" is a unique take on grrl power. Elsewhere, ""Everyone is Someone in L.A."" is a wonderful electro send-up of celebrity culture, and ""Watching Cars Go By"" is appropriately driving. But other tracks (""What She Wants,"" ""Let Your Mind Be Your Bed"")seem rather rushed and not fully thought out, and others are too tantalizingly short (""She's So D*mn Cool,"" ""Nitelife Funworld""), like embryos that haven't gestated. It feels as if Felix was trying to capitalize on the goodwill generated by the earlier album. But there's still enough here to warrant a listen."
2,Devin Dazzle is a Dud,"After picking up Kittenz and Thee Glitz, one of Felix da Housecat's other albums, I was very excited about this new cd. I was really let-down. I was looking for songs on the level of Silver Screen, Happy Hour, and Glitz Rock- all excellent songs from Felix. But there is nothing like any of those on this cd. There are maybe 2-3 listenable tracks: Rocket Ride, Watch Cars go by, and Hunting Season and Neon Human are all-right. Devin Dazzle, which I was hoping would be the best song, turned out to be my least favorite. It's a very fruity sounding song that describes Devin Dazzle, the man.If you are looking for some GOOD Felix da Housecat music, check out Kittenz & Thee Glitz or Metropolis Present Day: Thee Album"
3,Average,"KENTUCKY SPIRITWhen Emily Keating tried to claim the property she'd inherited from her late father, she was determined to make it on her own in the Kentucky wilderness - even though all of the settlers insisted she needed a man by her side. But the headstrong Emily had no intention of ever marrying - until she met Stephen Cutright, her dark, brooding, and strikingly handsome new employer.KENTUCKY PASSIONAfter losing his wife in childbirth, Cutter knew he would never share his life with anyone again. Then, he met his son's tutor. Emily's straitlaced appearance and prim manners concealed a seductive beauty of reckless abandon. But in a land where forever could mean a day or a lifetime, Cutter could only give her a passion as fiery - and fleeting - as the setting sun - unless Emily could tame his restless heart with a love that promised forever."
3,lots of fun but....,"We bought this toy for our son a couple of years ago. We still have all the parts but only because I am diligent about keeping things together. We find most of the Hot Wheels sets have too much to them, are frustrating to put together, and come apart often. I have looked high and low for good old regular tracks,corners, etc like the old sets we had as kids. My kids like to try to put sets together but you can't. The store brand tracks are cheaply made, split easily and don't last (ie.toys'r'us). Hot Wheels has gotten caught up in the hype of marketing and forgotten what it is like to make quality products that spark learning, experimenting and imagination."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this for my sons 4th birthday. He wanted it very badly, everytime he saw the commerical he would come running for me to watch it. I read the reviews and was alittle skeptic, but hubby said to get since thats what he wants. Its not worth it. The small track does not stay together, and very picky with cars that will work. We have a ton of hot wheels and found only a few that would go down the track. Glad it was only [$] bucks."
2,Pain in the Rear,"This toy has been a pain since opening the box. It is not fun to put together and then once it is put together, it never stays together. The shark's mouth doesn't work very easily to ""crunch the cars"". My 5-year old got this for Christmas and he rarely plays with it and it sits in its box on the shelf."
1,Fall Apart,My son wanted this toy and when he received it he was unable to play with it. It falls apart at the slightest touch. I have tried to find a way to super glue to no avail. I would stongly recommend not buying this. Way to much aggravation for parent and child alike.
2,Not worth it...,This toy was more trouble than it was worth trying to play with. My son and I spent more time unsticking the cars and various parts of the toy that we gave up and eventually kicked it to the curb........
2,Junked it....,"What can I say. We love Hot Wheels cars, and thought this would be great to add to my sons collection of Hot Wheels things- wrong. It kept falling apart. And the Sharks voice is really yucky! This was a thoughtful gift from a wonderful person. Too bad it is junk. After it falling apart the 100th time, we got rid of it. It is not up to the standards of Hot Wheels at all. We were all dissapointed."
4,Shark Park,I think this hot wheeels track is great! I have a six year old and a three year old and they both play with it.This toy is great because it doesn't have a lot of track and pieces to keep up with. On other tracks we have lost pieces and forgot how to put it back together. Shark Park is great because it actually stays together. We have had it for over a year now and they both still play with it. I give it a big thumbs up!
3,Great Toy,"All in all this was a great toy. My son saw it at the store and insisted for months that this is what he wanted for Christas. We read some of the reviews and were scared to buy it- but went ahead anyways. He's had a great time with it. He loves lining up his hundreds of cars and seeing which ones will be ""chomped"" by the shark. The only drawback is that it doesn't stay together very well. It stays together while you're playing with it, but when he tries to pick it up to put it away it falls apart sometimes. And he hasn't figured out how to put it back together yet. But- it's definitely a great buy! He has thoroughly enjoyed it. =)"
4,Fun but not durable,"I bought this for my 5 year old. He loves to play with it, but it is impossible to keep together. Everytime he wants to play with it, we have to search for the parts and reassemble it. It is very hard to keep together, when it stays together, he loves it. I don't recommend it, due to poor durability."
2,Do not buy,"My son really wanted this toy, but it does not live up to the expectations. It is poorly designed, does not integrate with the other hot wheels toys, and just isn't that much fun. The quality of the hot wheels products has really gone bad since I was a kid. He played with it for 20 mins and hasn't touched it since."
4,Really Cool!,My son received this toy for his 3rd birthday. He loves it! He has played with it everyday since he got it a month ago. We all have fun playing with it. He loves it when the shark catches the car! We have had no problems with the toy. I would recommend it!
2,Not worth the money,"My 3 year old son purchased this with ""earned"" money and was very disappointed with his first purchase. Most hotwheels or matchbox cars won't even go down the track and if they do, they don't go fast enough to activate the shark. It sits in his room and looks neat but it's very rarely played with. Also, if you forget to turn it off and bump it in the middle of the night it scares the pants off of you!"
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"My 5 yr. old son wanted this for Christmas soooo... bad. It appears exciting on the commercial and lacks luster in real life. Not worth the money. Cars get stuck in the Shark's mouth instead of going through as they are supposed to. My son doesn't even use the ""lift"". He just drops them manually. 4 weeks later after Christmas...he hardly plays with it."
1,Fun but not all it's cracked up to be!,This product was purchased for my 3 1/2 year old son who has wanted this item since it was first advertised on TV. He received it as a reward for certain behavior and he is thrilled. He doesn't even realize that the shark doesn't quite work as advertised and tends to fall over quite often. It might be annoying for older children though!
1,Don't bother!!,My mother-in-law bought this for our 4 year old son...he hates it! It falls apart if you look at it wrong! He gets mad at it because it doesn't work. BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
3,shark attack,"My son who is 4 wanted this item very badly. I wish I would have looked at this website before purchasing. It basically falls apart whenever he plays with it. It is also very particular on what type of cars you use with it. In my opinion, it is not worthy of the [money] we spent."
1,Complete waste of money,"My son was super excited when he saw the box. The excitement quickly dwindled when we started putting it together and was completely gone after playing with it for 5 minutes. It's made cheaply, the triggers for the sound either don't work or misfire 90% of the time, and it has zero educational value. If it ships to you enclosed in bubble wrap give the bubble wrap to your kids to play with and send back the Shark Park. They'll enjoy it more."
1,JUNK,"This toy is a piece of junk. It is VERY flimsy and within 1 hour, my son had the whole thing apart. The tracks do not stay connected and one piece falls off everytime you move the toy. My son enjoyed it, but I took it back and bought something else."
1,falls apart,This toy got thrown in the trash within two weeks. Has too many little pieces and always falls apart. Don't waste your money.
2,easily breakable,This toy was not as good as it would seem. The cars do not get enough speed to even make it through the sharks mouth. It also comes apart to easy. Our child lost interest in it soon because of these flaws. I will tell the parents i know to avoid this one.
5,Expensive but very thorough,"This is an outstanding book on higher education law. Lots of case examples and descriptions. A little repetative at some points, but I suppose that is true about law in general. Not even as dry as one might think about a 2 volume law book set."
1,The fell apart the first time I read it!,"terrible experience with this book...I bought it brand new, but when I opened it and read, I found it already fell apart! It is not the service, it is the quality of the product...I wish I had bought a used one!"
2,Poor design for a formula dispenser,"This product is very uncomfortable to use as a formula dispenser. The design of the lid makes it difficult to dispense the whole content out of the compartments. You have to turn upside down the cup several times to try to get the formula out of the cup (because it keeps staying around the hole). At the end you will manage to take the formula out, but when you have a hungry crying baby waiting for his food, it can get very disturbing. Maybe as a snack cup it works just fine.Later on, I bought the Munchkin formula dispenser, and it is great! The hole in the lead is in an angle, so the whole content goes out immediately when you turn the cup. Also, it is smaller and cheaper. By far, it is better than the Avent formula dispenser .Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary"
4,"Not perfect, but great for the money.","The good?* It's inexpensive* It's very sturdy* The lid stays closed/locked* The formula doesn't mix with other compartments* You can fit a lot of formula in each section (at least 6oz, I haven't tried 8oz yet)* The cup will be good for snacks when formula is doneThe bad?* It takes a bit of tamping and shaking to get all the formula out (and even then you might still miss some--but it's not usually that big of an amount to worry about)* It's a bit bulky."
2,Hard to get all of the formula out,"This is fine for what it is, but it's not as convenient as it could be due to the fact that formula gets stuck in it. I bought this as a solution for nighttime feedings but ended up using it during the day only, when I can see and make sure all the formula has been poured out.The first night I used this, I was leaving the lights off during feedings to help baby adjust to nighttime. I didn't realize that I hadn't dispensed all of the powder, so my poor baby got a very diluted bottle, and I didn't notice until daylight that not all of the formula had come out. I felt bad.Due to its design, you have to pour the formula out, then tilt it in one direction to get the rest out of one corner, then tilt to the other side and shake it to actually get the rest out.The positives are that it is dishwasher/microwave safe and BPA free, so I'll probably be using it for snacks in the future."
2,A MUST have Snack Cup,"I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent."
4,Sturdy and Inexpensive,"Pros- Cheap (i mean the price, for 5 bucks you can't go wrong- Lid fits snugly so no spillage- I like the fact that it has a separate inset for the milk compartments, making it easy to clean/wash with soap- I love it's colorCons- It's a bit hard to open up the cover so you can wash it or refill it. (hence the four stars)I've been thru a lot of milk dispensers when my nieces where growing up, most of the problem is how they are cheaply constructed making them susceptible to cracks when dropped or hit by stuff inside the diaper bag.This one is made to last. You can even use it as a container after baby has outgrown his/her formula."
5,"Philips Avent Formula Dispenser / Snack Cup, BPA-Free",This really worked well that's why I ordered two. One for traveling & one for night feedings. This really separated the powdered formula & didn't mix in with the other sections even when it was in my diaper bag.
3,Don't get it unless you're using the Avent bottles too,"I've tried three different brands of formula dispenser.This one is the easiest to fill and get the lid on and off, but it's hard to get all the powder out, and the little corners tend to dry very slowly, so unless you are very careful you can wind up with little lumps of damp powder in there.We're feeding with ""traditional"" glass Evenflo bottles. This doesn't fit into the mouth of the bottle very well - although you can wedge it in.I bought three, so we're continuing to use them, but I wouldn't buy them again. Maybe if using the Avent bottles."
3,nice to have it in the diaper bag,I agree with the reviewer to gave 2 stars. It was a little difficult to pour our all the powder at once. My nanny has bad eyes and she couldn't see there was powder caught around the hole. I have to pour several time to get the formula powder out. Not the best dispenser but it is a nice to have it in the diaper bag.
4,Morley VAI-2 good...but,"Solid product! Sounds great! However, very surprised that the AC adaptor wasn't included. When you buy a renowned 'name brand' such as ""Morley"", you don't expect to be 'nickel and dimed'. I ordered the adaptor but time was wasted. I also wasted a battery because it appeared the unit was off. If I had read the instructions, I would've unplugged the guitar cord...my fault but the light was off and I made the dreaded...""ass-u-me""."
2,No on & off switch!,"Decent sounding Wah, but no on & off switch! What the Heck? If you step on it and move it forward it automatically comes on. If you bring your foot all the way back it turns off. So here are the two main problems with this design.1. If you move your foot all the way back while playing it cuts out! If your moving your foot quickly it doesn't seem to do it, but if you are playing a soulful slow solo it cuts in and out every time you move your foot all the way back...Annoying! Steve Vai must have this position memorized, but those of who don't, can potentially keep turning it on and off. No Fun!2. Ever like to leave the pedal somewhere in the middle? Take your foot off and play for a while? A lot of players like to play for a while with one of those cool tones in the middle. Not on this one. If you take your foot off, it springs back to the upright position and turns itself off!I'm selling this thing. It doesn't do the things that Wah pedals have always done!"
2,Stripped down,"An abbreviated version of the Oxford Classical Dictionary, stripped of many entries and all bibliographies. This is now the third repackaging of the OCD (also appearing as Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization). The price is lower, but a waste of money. Save your pennies and buy the real thing."
5,Thoroughly entertaining read,"I don't wish to belittle other readers but some of the criticisms of this novel are just bizzare. The book may suffer from a small level of historical innacuracies, but then how accurate are accounts of Hannibal anyway since most recorded sources are written by Romans. What amazes me though is that almost all the people who read this book seem to have a perfect recolection of other novels, either that or they are simply copying other peoples comments. Leckie captures the hatred, and emotion in a trully moving way, and the reader is able to associate with a man who is in practice, far removed from todays culture. This in itself is an acheivment. A gripping read"
1,Only For Those With Cast Iron Stomachs,"When Sophocles' Oedipus blinds himself, he has the courtesy to do so off-stage. Not so when Ross Leckie's Hannibal removes his eye. Leckie leaves nothing to the imagination when it comes to torture, blood, guts, gore, torture, mutilation, and rape. Even that wouldn't have been quite enough for me to leave unfinished this work of historical fiction. But when the characters aren't outdoing each other in astrocities, the lead character is brooding, morose, and just plain annoying."
2,Disappointing,"Like other reviewers I was really looking forward to reading this book. Other than graphic accounts of torture scenes, I was left with little feeling for the period. The characters felt cartoonish, even at the end of the book most of them were still undeveloped. I did like the descriptions of the ""Roman character"" which refused to buckle under terrible losses. If there had been more of this and similar analysis of Carthage, I would have liked it more. I found myself liking Hannibal less and less as the book progressed."
2,"Hannibal, easy reading with little meat.","Hannibal was good easy reading. But it lacked the historical detail and description to make it, what I would consider, a good historical novel.There's much conjecture on Mr. Leckie's perspective, but I guess that's the point of historical fiction......I would have liked to see more details, I still don't know what Hannibal looked like. The time period was vague, the details of his wins and losses are glossed over.I would recommend this book for the young reader looking to spark interest in historical writing. For the more mature reader, it lacks depth."
1,Just Plain Awful,"I cannot believe that such painful writing ever saw the light of publishing. Further, it makes me cringe that someone somewhere made money off of this horrible use of trees.This is just plain awful. Painful. Uninteresting. Painful. Did I mention painful?If you want something more spellbinding, perhaps pick up a book written about colon research. To all future publishers: Let's see to it that Leckie never be permitted to write again. Thanks."
3,If you want a war story,"Leckie's ""Hannibal"" is fine as a historical, war novel. Leckie describes the geography of the Mediterranean lands quite well, and historical events are told precisely and interestingly. But, when you finish the book, nothing lingers in your mind. Hannibal's mania withers from the page and rather than mulling over ideas from the book you immediately begin wondering what you'll read next."
1,"A screnplay based on Leckies book ""Hannibal the Conqueror""","They are now making a movie based on this trash, and of all people - Vin Diesel is playing Hannibal. Yes, Hannibal did a few amazing things but he was no Conqueror. The real hero and conqueror is Scipio Africanus, Who defeated Hannibal at Zama, and conquered all of Hannibals Generals in Spain. A better read than Leckie, is ""Scipio Africanus, Greater than Napoleon"", by Sir Basil Henry Liddel Hart. Scipio was one of the greatest Generals of the Ancient World. A movie about Scipio should be made."
1,Not for historians or Punic War buffs,"Mr Leckie makes it obvious he has not read the works of Livy nor Polybius. He calls the allies auxiliary the Extraordinarii (crack roman troops), thinks Trasimene happened in a valley with a lake at one far end, has the cavalry chase the velites off the field at Cannae and has no clue what Hannibal really accomplished in southern Italy. Definitely not for literate history buffs or ancient military buffs for that matter."
1,"Please, Hannibal deserves better","I'm sorry, but this is an awful book. I've never written such a thing in a review before, but I'm absolutely aghast that this thing ever got in to print. The story of Hannibal's war with Rome is one of the most engaging, dramatic stories in world history and it should make for wonderful fiction. Mr. Leckie, unforetunately, reduces Hannibal to a paper thin ogre of a man, and fills the novel with unpleasant extremes far outside what's required to tell the story. That's not to say that I shy away from violence. Just the opposite. I know how violent the times were. But Ross Leckie's writing is artless and that renders all else in doubt. Reading this novel is like chewing cardboard. It's like driving splinters up into your fingernails. Don't do it. Read the other negative reviews on this website and believe them! Await the day when Hannibal finds the storyteller to do his tale justice. When that happens, we might all be in for a great read."
4,In from the cold: a review of The Ice Age World,"The Ice Age World by Bjorn Andersen and Harold Borns, Jr. is an excellent resource for those interested in the the glacial history of North America and Europe. The beautiful full-colour illustrations and photographs, accompanied by clear and informative captions, make this book ideal for all knowledge-levels. The section on processes and scientific methods, as well as the extended glossary, are invaluable to the student of quaternary geology. The Ice Age World is as ""at home"" by the fire as it is in the classroom."
4,awesome,"I have to say that, I have not yet put it up on the wall. I did however unroll it and the print is beautiful and vivid. Can't wait to see it up in my son's bedroom."
5,Excellent Produduct for the Price,I have never used a pressure cooker in my life but I decided to give it a try. I was astounded by the simplicity of this product as well as the delicous meal I created on my first try. The recipe book is great. It is filled with gourmet meals that can be prepared by a novice cook like myself and all in under 30 minutes!! I don't know how I lived without this pressure cooker before. It has really changed the way I think about cooking!
3,Ready for the RICA?,"I passed the RICA the first try, but it is not solely due to this book. This book is a great springboard for organizing the material. However, I would recommend another book to study with it-- something more substantial to help with the essay portions. If you are in a teacher crendentialing program you are probably using a literacy textbook. Our school uses Gail Thompson's Literacy for the 21st Century, which is excellent."
2,Not Indicative of the Test,"Careful using this book alone. I studied it exclusively for the test and did very well on the practice ""exam."" However, the actual test is another animal, entirely. Don't know if I passed yet but I didn't leave the session very confident. You'll need more."
2,Too general and not ideal for a single review source,"I just took the RICA exam and used this book as well as course material to prepare for the exam. I found ""Ready for RICA"" lacking in its depth and context. It provides a consice overview of the content areas but lacks in its review of strategies. I also noticed it focused too much on elementary compentency and not enough on higher grades or ELD.I don't know if I passed the RICA yet, but I did not feel this book prepared me enough for the actual exam."
1,Not ready for the RICA,Not ready for the RICA should be the topic of this book. This book did not help me at all on the exam. It did not prepare me well enough for the essay section particulary the case study section of the exam. Don't buy. It is a waste of money.
5,cottage night stand,"Bought these on-line based on others review and very happy. Was looking for something cute & rustic w/ storage, that wasn't too small, to go w/ our new bronze finished iron bed,. Very well constructed, priced right and very pretty. I'm going to dress them up a little with nicer knobs, but other that that, highly recommend!"
3,Overpriced Expansion?,"Amazon is selling this expansion for $19, which is somewhat expensive. For new player who never play NWN, Neverwinter Nights: Diamond Compilation Pack is a better deal. It includes Kingmaker plus original game and two other expansions for $20. For experienced player who already have SoU and HotU, you could buy the modules directly from BioWare. Shadow Guard + Witch's Wake cost $5 total and Kingmaker costs $8. The download not only saves you money, but also saves you the delivery time."
2,No Point,"There's really no point in buying this if you've already got the demo-version, because the expansion pack is just the demo with its own C.D. It stops at the exact same spots, and you're given the same choices. The creators never continued the story after the first ""chapter"" so there's nothing beyond it. I enjoyed playing the game, but overall there's no point to buy it when they give you these epic beginnings but no follow-through.Basically: Don't bother."
4,For those of you who don't have it all.,Good expansions. Good for people who don't have everything. These expansions are of quality gaming value. Worth a look at the very least and worth the money. No experience necessary.
4,Lethal Weapon in the Orient,"Following the murder of his mother, a twelve year old boy (Huang Kun Husen) is sent to live with his alcoholic father, an ex-cop who was dismissed from the force due to ""barbaric"" methods of dealing with criminals. Slowly, the two form a relationship, and dad even starts an attempt to give up the booze, vows to help his son solve the mystery of his mom's death. This member of the Hong Kong action genre is actually one of the better one's I've seen, includes some great laughs and a terrific shoot-out scene all wrapped up in a sweet story of a boy and his dad rekindling their love and respect for one another. Think of Lethal Weapon in the Orient, the difference between the ""investigators"" here being one of age rather than skin color. A real winner for those in search of a suspenseful evening!"
2,"Wonderful show, poor quality recording","""Little Bear"" is one of the best children's shows on television. However, the recording quality of this tape is awful. It was intentionally recorded in EP/SLP mode to save on tape, and is grainy and has poor sound quality. Too bad."
5,Winter Solstice,"As far as I know, this is the only kids video that depicts a celebration of Winter Solstice instead of Christmas and for that reason, I highly recommend it for any parent who celebrates Winter Solstice.I also was impressed that the ""snow angels"" that ate the cookies from the trees turned out to be hungry animals. That may get kids thinking critically about possible alternative explanations for things, and which explanations fit best...and maybe about what is real, and what isn't. It is a refreshing change from all the tons of Santa Clause stories this time of year.In general ""Little Bear"" is always a nice, nonviolent cartoon for kids that centers on Little Bear's relationships with his family and friends."
5,No one is too old to watch Little Bear!,"I'm 15, but I still love Little Bear. I have taped nearly all the stories, and I watch them often. Little Bear is imaginative and real, and the stories are always simple and fresh. These four are no exception. In ""Winter Solstice"", Little Bear and his family hang lanterns and food in a tree for the 'snow angels'. Little Bear discovers that the snow angels are actually the wild animals who need food to keep them warm on the longest night of the year. In ""Snowbound"", Little Bear and his parents go to visit Emily, and he is very excited when they have to stay the night. They dance and tell jokes, until Emily and Little Bear become sleepy, and bunk down by the fire. I havn't got this edition of the video, so I can't say if the picture quality is as bad as it's said to be, but I recommend it for anyone. Little Bear is an inspiration."
2,Old video,"The box came in good shape, but the video when played has that wiggly stripe on the top of the picture- the one you get when the video is old and played too much.Thsi video was supposed to be in excellent condition. Definitely not better than OK condition."
5,I love Little Bear!,"I'm in college and I absolutely love everything about Little Bear. This is a wonderful video, and makes you feel so warm and cozy all over like when you're with family and friends at wonderful Christmastime. However, I'm disgusted that anyone would relate this wonderful video with paganism."
2,Not so satisfied customer,"I received the international edition. This was not what I ordered, however it turns out it is the aalmost the exact same book. It worked for my classes. Amazon would not buy this product back so even they must think it is not ok to buy the international edition."
4,"Readable, detailed bio of Intel's leader","""Americans don't know how lucky they are,"" a young immigrant named Andy Grove told The New York Times in 1960 after graduating first in his engineering class. ""Friends told me all that I needed was ability."" This wonderful book describes how the able and autodidactic Andy Grove went from penurious refugee to prince of Silicon Valley. Richard S. Tedlow, a historian who teaches at Harvard Business School, neither lionizes nor lambastes Grove. Instead, he provides gigabytes of facts about one of the twentieth century's most demanding and successful technology leaders. While it is sometimes a bit too detailed, we think this book is a treat for anyone interested in leadership, management, economic history or technology. No rags-to-riches story could have a better protagonist than profane, irascible, brilliant Andy Grove."
1,Old bleach,"Was sent old bleach. I've used bleaching products many times, but these stank. These syringes arrived without an expiration date marked on them, and they didn't whiten my teeth at all."
1,Expired Tooth Gel!,I guess Gelly Smile changed name already to Sunshine (?) Beware they sell expired tooth gel! Mine was dated: 5/l8/07 (it is the number placed next to serial number. I contacted them and they did not respond.
1,not what I expected,"The product did not live up to my expectations. I purchased the stamps to add my initials to my art pieces. I tried getting the stamps to leave an empression on each piece. I used several different malllets. Each time I did it, the stamp only left a partial letter. I considered sending the stamp set back for credit, but did not. Not a wise purchase decision."
3,Good Book,"I liked the training plans on this book. Personally, tables are easier to skim through than text or anecdotes. Plus it's a thin book and easy to carry around. Daniel's Book had a lot of stuff that overwhelmed me. This is truly a good beginner's guide because unlike other beginner books that just go on and on about how to choose the right shoe or what to wear or how life changing running can be...it gives you training tables. Something I'd like to know after I finally have the shoes. Unlike more advanced books...it doesn't talk about Lactate Tresholds, or give me instructions like run at 10K pace, VO2 Max."
4,As the title suggests - for Beginners,"If you've read nothing else about running, this is a good a place as any to start. If you've read two other books about running, the information provided will not be for you.Where it got its four stars from me was in the training schedule. Although for beginners, you'll find plans in here for anyone wanting a 2:50 marathon finish time. You rarely see that in most beginner books.I bought it because the price was right ($1.83) but think I'd pay the $10+ Amazon offers if I had to. You'll read it in less than an hour but will spend plenty of time applying the training.I intend to do so for an upcoming marathon."
1,chain was paper thin,Hello i gave the necklace to my girlfriend and in less than 12 after the chain just snapped rite in the middle. Pretty messed up that a chain that thin can even be sold. What was it made just to be decorative or something. Well im very disappointed in amazon now and won't be getting something off here ever again.
2,Beautiful but fragile,"The pendant was very nice looking and priced well. However, 10 days after the present was bought the chain had broken in my wife's sleep. We were both very disappointed, and will now have to buy a replacement chain."
3,small,This necklace is much smaller and flater then i thought it would be. It looks nice but kind of cheap too
5,"Lovely necklace, for a great price!!","I was skeptical at first, but when the pendant arrived it was very nice. It is very lovely, and does not have any sort of ""cheap"" feel to it. It is petite and sleek; doesn't stand out too bad, but is pretty enough to catch attention! A longer chain is needed when ordering, just so future buyers are aware. But, this was an excellent purchase."
5,GREAT GIFT FOR MOM,"I GAVE THIS FIVE STARS It was exactally what was shown!! Packaging was awesome. The necklace and penant was in a plastic bag inside a very nice box, that will make ""your "" mom wonder what awesome gift she is receving...it doesn't even need to be wrapped .....but for xmas I will wrap it. This is also a great gift for your wife whom has beared your children...this is one of the special gifts that I am urgently waiting for my wife to open...note the cost is great for what you are getting a huge smile from your loved one...."
5,Absolutely beautiful!!!,I love it!!! This necklace is absolutely beautiful!!! I love it!!! I wear it all the time! Just the perfect size!
5,mother in law loves her single mother 3 kids necklace,"mother in law loves her single mother 3 kids necklace. my husband got it for M-in_L for mother's day. she's very happy with it and wears it all the time. She's not a single mother, and isn't impressed when I call the necklace that."
2,Good DSST study guides are hard to come by!,"This ""study guide"" was not a study guide at all! Rather, it was just a fat, poorly edited spiral of ""pretend tests."""
1,lacks subject review,"This book - like all of the other Jack Rudman books I have seen - consists only of multiple choice questions, without any explanations of answers and lacks subject review material."
4,Outside the Box,"Storkey has an excellent review of the pre-modern, modern and post-modern concepts of gender and how they have impacted the general social fabric of western culture and relationships. She gives fair critique of ""traditional"" Christian values as they can be cited more as reactions to changes in the culture than representative of an embodied faith. I highly recommend this book to anyone well versed (or seeking to be) on gender studies and the influence of the Christian faith in this area. The unique voice of Storkey is one of a Christian that speaks outside the anticipated box of Christian thinking. Like other academics, Storkey places the information well without setting forth any alternative directions."
3,Not too bad,"I thought that Loop was entertaining for the most part. At times it read more like a medical journal than a novel and bogged down or read slow during does points. It was far removed from the ""girl in the well"" in Ring...which started this whole series. Loop was definitely not what I would have expected. Despite that I look forward to the prequel-""Birthday"" next fall."
3,Male Nurse Action Figure,"This is a great product that I enjoyed giving my friend who just graduated from nursing school. However, I was charged over $30.00 for this product. When I received it I saw that the seller had a price tag on it for 10.99!!! I do not appreciate the 200% price mark up!!!"
4,great hat,I love the low profile of this hat. It fits my big head and the mesh back keeps me cool in the heat
1,Its a brick,"Not even worth 1 star.Problems with firewire implementation. Crippled cakewalk software. Advised by Alesis to upgrade firmware. Applied firmware update, bricked item. It no longer even works as a mixer !!! Great. I have to return item at my expense to Alesis so they can reflash."
1,If you thought Quantum physics was easy...,"I have Techno EJay, and I wanted to get a few more options (cut and paste, fading, etc...) With Techno two hours after I had opened the box I had written a song that sounded rather professional, I was very pleased. With Data Becker's Music Center Pro they've made things that should be Easy and Simple so Complex it's just frustrating. Instead of the 1 inch thick book it comes with how about including a College course? It may be the best music software on earth but if I can't use it what good is it to me? You finally get a little music going and then the software crashes... stupid, stupid, stupid..."
4,An excellent overview of sexuality in China,"This book offers an excellent overview of the various aspects of sexuality throughout the written history of china. It covers the Chinese view of sex and gender orientation from the later Han dynasty to modern times. The book is well written and organized, with wide range of topics. I used this book as a reference for my Masters in Oriental Medicine thesis on the Chinese medicine treatment of impotence."
4,Lives up to promise,"This is the second in the series featuring Fran Varady, a young amateur sleuth in London. While the series had a slow start in Asking for Trouble, that book showed some promise as to how Fran would develop and the author lives up to this promise in Keeping Bad Company. Fran's character is developed and she remains the core and focus of the story. There is an intelligent plot, albeit somewhat predictable. It would be interesting to see Fran develop a harder edge in the future while retaining her youthful honesty."
3,Unimpressed,"I picked Sandra Wilson's book up at a local library, hoping to find inspiration for my next gift giving adventure. What I found was a failed attempt at teaching us what the ""perfect gift"" is. I was expecting less of the lists of popular things to give and more practical advice about what is behind a gift. While the author does try to provide us with information about what she thinks certain population groups will like, she falls short in the way she presents the information. I'm sure the large print and short ""blurb"" style writing will attract some, but I for one am not impressed."
3,Good but Expensive book,Interesting book...primarily intended for an academic audience....shows a lot of examples and tools...
1,Office Ready Family Essentials,"Don't buy this product. It won't work with office 2000 without a patch-I got patch and still didn't work. Canon does not support software. If you call the number given by canon, the number is disconnected. This product never worked properly from what I can tell and Canon never cared. If you are running xp, forget it, it won't even install. Bottom line, don't buy this product, and I would never buy anything from canon again."
3,A good short reference,Sort of encyclopedia of classic R&B; and Rock:it helps you put the names with the artists and their hits.With the advent of Amy Winehouse one begins to wonder what is that quality of style that makes an Elvis Prestley or Janis Joplin?And why do they seem to be self destructive? I thinkI would welcome someone with a little more insight into the people and their music than shown here.
4,Interesting with a sprinkle of reality in it,"Carly McFarlane has a so called 'best friend', Heather who snatches every single one of Carly boyfriends. So she finally decided to find the perfect guy for Heather to stop this craziness. Jack obviously was attracted to Carly from the first time they met being it such a bizarre situation. Though being absolutely 'blur' from the beginning, she thinks that he is the best match for her friend. This book is pretty interesting. With a few other characters in it to spice it all up. Watch out for Carly's sister, Joelle with her witty as well as thoughtful comebacks at some parts of the book. Overall it is quite a good and enjoyable book. Worth the time spent on reading it."
5,Beautiful dress,Beautiful dress arrived in perfect condition. The picture does not do justice to the product.
3,"Great little dress - see through, however.",This is a beautiful dress. Just be sure to order a slip as well. It was very see through and the girls said it was very itchy.
4,nice enough,"as this is the second dress i bought for my daughter, i was a little leary, but it definitley was a better option than the first dress purchased. this one looked nice enough for the price...not spectacular, but also not a $100+ dress. she looked very nice as a flower girl in this dress...probably wouldn't have passed muster for a very high end wedding though. overall, happy with the dress (could have been a little fuller, only two layers of tulle) my daughter loved it and the bride liked it....so that's all that really matters."
4,Good but not quite perfect,"This replacement fan is very quiet, but not as silent as the original in our TIVO HD XL unit. The original fan would periodically scream at us. So we needed a replacement. This one is pretty good, but it turns out that any small vibration is amplified by the TIVO case when assembled. We now have a constant ""white noise"", noticeable at night, instead of periodic screeching. So a good result, but not perfect."
3,3-pin plug. TiVo HD has 2-pin plug.,I bought this based on comments saying that it worked for TiVo. My TiVo HD has a 2-pin plug. This fan has a 3-pin plug. What's the deal? Did the previous commenters have different TiVo models that have a 3-pin plug? Did they just plug the 3-pin fan plug into a 2-pin TiVo socket? Which 2 of the 3 pins did they use? Why didn't the commenters include this info?
3,Good fan as a replacement,"I purchased this fan as a replacement for a CPU cooling fan that was DOA out of the box. The fan runs well, and is quiet. I think that it is a better fan than the original equipment unit."
1,Repackaged evercool fan,I had purchased this to replace a noisy evercool fan in my Tivo. Discovered that this is the same fan with new stickers on one side and different package.
4,Great beginner book at good price,I am a Classic ASP developer. The company that I work for has recently decided to pursue .NET for future web development. This was the first book that I read in order to get a grasp of the changes from Classic ASP to ASP.NET. I have to say that this book was a GREAT introduction to a lot of the new features of ASP.NET.There are a few things I would like to point out when considering buying this book:1.This is a beginner book. No advanced topics.2.Good coverage of the different types of controls available in .NET.3.Quick and easy read.4.Only basic coverage of ADO.NET.5.Source code available as a download.6.Assumes that you have VS.NET although I used ASP.NET Web Matrix.There were some typos but nothing ridiculous.Overall I like this book. Good price for a good book.
5,Concise lessons to get you going fast,"The title says it all; if you don't have a lot of time to read and just want examples that show you how to get started, this book is for you. The sections on validation controls and ADO.NET were particularly helpful to me: simple code that works, helping me gradually shift my paradigm while still being productive in the transition.Although the appendices contain some lightweight ""refresher"" language and class references (which do what they are expected to do), your deeper needs may not be met here. If you need a more complete view of the .NET framework, try Steven Walther's ASP.NET Unleashed; on the other hand, if you want to get your brain around the web controls and data access that form the core of most ASP.NET applications, look no further than ASP.NET By Example. It does what it claims to do, without being everything to everyone... which works very well for its typical reader, the time-starved developer who just came to be shown how to get the job done."
2,Outdated,"This book is outdated and would have been fine a decade ago. .NET is version 4+ now, a good bit has changed."
4,For beginners.,"Steven A. Smith, ASP.NET by Example (Que, 2002)It's been five years since the release of ASP.NET by Example, so if you're already well-versed in ASP.NET, this probably isn't the book for you. I, on the other hand, know nothing about ASP.NET, and picked it up as an introductory tome. (If you do so, you should have at least a decent background in either VB.NET or C#, the two languages Smith alternates between for his code-behind pages.) As someone coming into ASP.NET brand-new, I found it well worth reading, informative, and easy to understand. Of course, some stuff has changed in the intervening years, but enough has stayed the same so most of the book will still be useful to the ASP.NET noob. A good place for beginners to start. ****"
2,Disappointing,"After reading some of the other ""by Example"" books, this one was a disappointment. XML by example was excellent.This book was too full of errors, and would do more harm than good for someone's first book.There are better books out there to learn ASP.NET.Perhaps a second edition, with closer editing, would be better"
1,what a piece of JUNK,"Actually, I would rate this no stars, but it won't let me .I set this up because it was recommended by a tech savvy friend. For Days we struggled to make it work. I called the Tech support 4 times - spent hours trying to configure it. Finally they decided I needed a senior Tech support guy. After an hours and a half he decided that the equipment was dysfunctional and that I should return it to amazon where I bought it. Needless to say, I am out hours of precious time and pretty burned by this whole experience. I'm afraid to get another of the same for fear I will have another bum piece of equipment. This is not brain science....thankfully!"
2,Consumer,"The system, when working correctly is great. However it freezes up multiple times during web surfing making it very annoying to navigate web pages. I give it a D. Find something better."
1,Basically a paperweight,"I bought this product hoping it would fill the gaps in wifi coverage in my house. However, all I have received from the item is hours of frustration and a high-tech paperweight. The quick-install disc fails to properly set up the range extender. There is a backup, since apparently this is a common occurrence, which requires fiddling with your ip address and then accessing the device using your web browser. I am familiar with this, since I have used a similar process to set up and adjust my wireless router. However, nothing seems to work to make this item do anything of value. After multiple attempts on different days, each lasting several frustrating hours, I have given up on the Hawking and will find a device that actually works."
3,Not everything that I had hoped for.,"Works barely. I have it between my bedroom and the study to get a better reception in bedroom for my iPad. In the bedroom it improves the performance slightly. However, in other areas, it conflicts with the dsl router signal, and I am forced to swtich back to the router."
1,Hawking HWREG1,"Spent a few hours setting this up, including time spent with their tech support folks. I returned it as I saw that it made no difference at all in wireless reception in my home."
2,Can't get it to work,"Tried everything, can't get it to work. I can connect to it, but I get no internet connection. Nobody has been able to help."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON!,"I bought this extender to try because I had already tried a dlink that didn't work. In the small print, you'll see that Amazon notes ""this item cannot be returned."" The only reason I buy from Amazon is because of their vaunted return policy. Don't believe them!The extender didn't work, tech support is in India, and I'm very unhappy. Won't be buying ANYTHING from Amazon or Hawking in the future."
2,BUGS IN SETTING UP,YOU WIIL REALY HAVE TO WORK TO GET THIS WORKING RIGHT. SAVE YOUR RECEITS YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IT. TO RETURN IT BACK.
5,Works,"This works perfectly fine if you set it up right.Our setup was still far away from the extender and nothing could really be done.It does mostly have the same problems as routers(walls, interruption,etc.)Overall, works as it should and is perfect when your laptop/desktop is within range of it."
5,"Good product, worked easily.",Easily connected to the wireless link with the software. If you want a stronger link (long distance between router) would recommend getting an additional antenna.
5,Very nice to have,"I was looking for a way to extent my wireless network to my neighbor's house and this unit did the trick. Setup was a snap. Simply plug-in the unit and insert the included setup CD. Answer a few configuration questions and place the unit in the desired location and you're ready to go. My neighbor's computer went from having no signal to a strong four bar signal.Additionally, all the dead spots in my house are now gone, allowing us to move computers anywhere we want. The unit also extended our wireless signal to my detached garage, allowing me to stream music to my laptop, whereas previously I kept losing the signal. The kids like it because now they can sit outside and play PSP and Nintendo DS games online."
3,depends on router,"I bought this product for my AT&T 2Wire dsl router - could not get it to work properly AT ALL. I'm an IT guy, so kinda know what I'm doing. Anyway, after much reconfiguring, decided instead of sending it back, to try it on my wireless Linksys at work. OMG - it hooked up in minutes, w/o a problem. So the product is not flawed, just don't use it for the 2Wire router, you'll pull your hair out trying to get it to work. So, although I gave it a 3 stars - because my work now owns it, not me, be aware of it's limitations."
1,Try another product,"Frustrating product. Set up was fine, it kept asking for a security code and would not let me connect. Tried all possible security codes and nothing worked. Called tech and was sent to India where the rep could not understand me. After trying to say and spell my name four times, I gave up. No better on other attemps. Their service is a joke. Can't use the unit, it's a waste of money."
2,Extends Range but Kills Performance,"The installation was straight forward if you are familiar with setting up networks. The signal strength did double from 30% to 60%; however, the performance took a nose-dive and the connection was not stable. I returned the product."
1,Could not get it to set up,"I spent over two hours with tech support in India and still could never get this range extender to setup properly. We tried on two PCs, one with Vista and one with Windows 7, and on my new MacBook Pro. In the end they said I needed to phone the manufacturer of my router (Linksys) and get them to change the channel of the router to channel 11. I said that after wasting two hours with no results, I preferred not to call anyone else and asked for an RMA. After the person I was dealing with checked with a supervisor, he said, ""no."" They can issue an RMA only after finishing troubleshooting and troubleshooting would not be finished until i called Linkysys to get them to change the channel number. I found this hard to believe but that is exactly what they said on 21 July 2010 at 3:45 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. I obviously will never go near a Hawking product aain."
1,poor value,"this thang did not work for me, i'm not technically gifted. I resold this to someone who is, it works for them."
1,Hawking can't lock onto and hold a wireless signal,"Well, I took the advice of another reviewer on this board and tried another Hawking device-- thinking that perhaps this Wireless G version would work with my 2wire 2701 HG. NOPE- I experienced the exact same problem as before (see my other less-than-glowing Hawking review). I DID go into the configuration, made sure the assigned IP addresses were correct and tried switching channels (keeping the Hawking on the same channel as the 2wire). Did NOT help. I do get 5 bars all over the house from the Hawking signal, but what good is it if BOTH computers in my house randomly lose the Hawking signal FOR NO APPARENT REASON. Hawking is incapable of mantaining a lock on the signal. I did check with tech support and was told that all of my settings are correct. Therefore, this Hawking device, like the last one, went back to the vendor. HAWKING FAILED AGAIN. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you enjoy having your gag reflex induced."
2,Very slow with WPA,"I have a Mac, and the documentation is definitely Windows-centric. Nevertheless, it has a web browser interface, so I was able to quickly set it up. To keep things simple, I was running my wireless network without any encryption, and the extender worked just fine. Then I turned on WPA, and the extender slowed to a crawl. Very disappointed as I was hoping to extend my network out to our porch.Bottom line: If you want to use WPA (as any person should), do not use this extender."
2,It does not work and seller makes you pay shipping to exchange it!,It was faulty according to manufacturer on the phone and this PC Universe made US pay to ship it back to exchange for a proper one! We still await it. No item and no communication yet????? PC Universe is not to be considered a trustworthy seller. I gave it 2 stars ONLY because Amazon reimbursed the return shipping for us since PC Universe would not!
2,very difficult to configure,"I found this product very difficult to configure and ended up sending it back. If your Wifi network supports Wireless-N and WEP-PSK, I recommend getting a Wireless-N extender instead. They work with a push-button system that is MUCH easier."
2,Didn't work,"Box said it was simple to install and set up, I beg to differ it didn't work and offshore tech support was useless as I couldn't understand the Tech.Sent it back for refund."
1,This thing is a piece of junk and drivers setup don't work!,"I was able to find the router connected to my p.c. used their lame configuration thing, went through the steps. When it gets to search SSID. nothing is found. NADA nothing. Do not buy this piece of junk. It will waste time from your life. I am a competent tech, and this thing simply doesn't work."
3,Bad and Good,"This product would not work with the wireless network at my college. However, the staff at my church was looking for a way to extend the reach of the wireless network there. I gace it to the church where it is providing the desired result."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Do not buy this product. Tried to connect this range extender step-by-step (as per the instructions) to both my Windows XP and my Windows Vista laptop and the software continually froze on both computers.Called technical support and had the tech explain how to connect this step-by-step to my Vista machine. It was very difficult to understand the tech given his incredibly thick Indian accent. He was patient, but frankly communication was labored. 37 minutes later, it was a no go. Tech recommended that I contact my service provider for assistance with the router...Went and bought the Linksys Wireless-G range expander and 15 minutes later my network was up and running.There's got to be a better way. Turns out there is...buy the competition."
2,A series of failures,"Wow. I have two, neither holds a signal for longer than two days. I have had to reset/reconfigure these two little devices constantly.I finally lost the setup CD and went to the Hawkings support site. The product support page does not load.I called tech support and tried my best to understand the instructions provided by live tech support, but his accent was so thick that I could not follow even the simplest of terms. A very kind and patient person, but useless in this position.I have tried to contact Hawkings by email, but I don;t hold a lot of home. Many of the elements on their home page indicate that they are under construction-- try back in a few days.Never again. Buyer beware."
3,Good device except for the power supply,"I purchased this device and I almost immediately experienced network interruptions on a weekly basis. I had to reprogram the device all the time, re-entering the same network parameters all the time. I was about to return it or just throw it away until the power supply just died and I replaced it with another spare one that I had in one of my junk drawers. I haven't experienced any issues since. It's been very stable and performed as I expected in the first place. I conclude that the power supply that was originally provided was either defective or simply poorly designed. Since I read that other have also experienced issues with the power supply, it's likely that the guys at Hawking used a cheap power supply."
3,Good device but doesn't support gaming,"Much like other users, spent 4 hours with tech support in India to get the deviced configured and the settings to save (particularly the WEP encryption). After getting it programmed, had problems connecting with the MAC, PC worked fine...but the real problem was that it did not support the children's gaming on the xbox 360. We will need to return it and get a device that supports gaming. Bottom line, set up is challenging-don't hesitate to contact tech support-very helpful. But once set up, looks like it works well."
4,It's working but doesn't make miracles.,"The product is fine, it's very easy to install and set it up, but somehow the range coverage isn't as good as claimed.I'm just 5 meters away from it, with a wall in between, but I only get 2 bars of windows vista's signal. I think that's not a great performance, considering that without the unit I got 1 bar, so it helped me improve just a bit.Also don't fool yourself by pictures because it's bigger than you'd think it is.Product quality is poor, the plastics are very cheap, but works.-"
4,nice,"The first cut has a killer horn riff over a funky beat almost like ultra funky version of that cut they were playing in the cantina in the first star wars movie. I bought the cd after hearing this, and it's probably the most original song on the album. Second tune changes its groove, kinda dance smoothe with a woman vocalist - pleasant. Third tune kicks off kind of 'afro-beat' with fela-esque guitar strumming and not so fela-ish synth playing over things. Appropriately called ""Afro-rainbow"". Next one kind of a cool electro-samba with a rhodes playing over the beat and horn corners.think theivery corporation for next one, ""head on the block pt 1"". ""used to be"" after that is groovy as well. ok, i'm not gonna go through every song, but basically it's pleasant quality work that you get with this cd - easy to have on your stereo as you cruise amazon or whatever."
1,Horrible,"This game was a giant waste of money. It looks like it has 20 year old graphics. There is a line in the middle of the slot machines, and you can't just play. You have to get some girl character to the casino. Awful!"
4,very essence book on nutrition healing on various diseases,"this is an interesting book that showed in essence and clearness how the nutritional medicine act and heals through nutrition and supplements. allergy,infertility,hypoglicemia,central nervous system diseases,arthritis,skin diseases and a lot more are fully explained in this book .the general nutrition aspects as a rule of healthy living is also explained, and there are all along of this book some interesting case histories. this book although i gave him 4 stars wich is good but not exelant, it is one of the books that is very simple to read,enjoy, and understand a text that is very complex in is meaning, but was shown and explained so simply."
5,Must have for Makita 2012 Planer,"If you have the Makita planer, you have to have this item to keep the chips from going everywhere. The exit size is not easy to adapt, but as with most chip catchers/dust collectors, a little ingenuity and some duct tape goes a long way towards making up the difference to adapt to your dust collector or shop vac.It's very easy to install and remove and again, highly recommended to have with the planer it's made for."
3,DC for a planer,"This one should have came with the planer. Dust collection is needed on this planer (just to keep the cutter head clear). For the price of the Makita planer, it should have came with it. And why did they make it 3 inch???"
4,Better than the others...,"We are quite pleased with this bathtub toy cubby. It holds a lot of toys and the top is wide open for easy access. It stays attached much better than our previous one. It has only fallen a few times. It's not perfect but it's the best one I've found so far. We previously had the cheaper (you get what you pay for!) Sassy mesh frog that hung on the wall of the bath tub. It was very difficult to use, held few toys and fell down frequently. Pay the extra $5 and get this one- it is much better!"
1,Not very functional,"Like many of the other posters, the toy bag does not stick to our bathroom wall. This is very frustrating because when it is full of toys and it falls off the wall it makes a loud noise and a big mess. It falls off the wall even when it is empty, which is still annoying because it should stay on the wall.The other issue I had was the blue dye on the fabric bled onto many of the soft plastic toys or sponges."
1,won't stick to the walls!,"The whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub, but that is impossible since it won't stick to tile above the tub. I hadn't even put any toys in it, and it wouldn't stick. I returned it and found something on ""One Step Ahead""."
2,disappointed,I really was disappointed with this product. Our tub has rounded corners and tile above and the cubby wont stick to tile.
1,useless,"I can't get it to stick! I might be able to get one or two of the cups to hold, but as soon as I put toys in it, it falls."
2,One side won't stick to my walls,"Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath, but one side doesn't seem to want to stick to the walls."
