4,Cross Stitch your way around the world,"I design samplers and other embroidery pieces. This book has agood collection of designs from most countries that you can combine into samplers or use separately. They include famous buildings, symbols, people and animals. The animals and buildings are well drawn. The people generally are not. Dracula, for example, is a face with fangs and a sort of Mardi Gras mask. Rather disappointing. The best designs I thought were animals (especially from Australia) and the nesting dolls and buildings from Russia. I was disappointed in Scandanavia, which was all crowded together with no outstanding designs. The USA I thought had the best overall designs. Overall the color choices are not exciting but you can liven them up yourself.So buy this book if for fun and to a wide representation of deisgns, but don't expect any masterpiece of cross stitch designs."
4,Stranger In A Strange Land,Lafcadio Hearn took up residence in Japan at a time when Western influence on the people and culture were minimal. His descriptions of customs and the individual people he encounters are filled with his own sense of wonder at the difference from anything he's known as a westerner. As a record of Japan in the Miejii Period his writing is incredibly atmospheric and evocative. This is a valuable selection for anyone interested in the period of Japanese history preceding the modernization of the 20th century. Hearn's style can feel dated at times but it is packed with reflective observations of a world about to go through transformative changes. Like old photographs these sketches can be revisited again and again to gain a sense of just how exotic Japan must have felt to an early visitor.
4,Spectacular stunt riding,"Okay, the story is a basic cowboy-and-Indian potboiler. But the stunt riding is unparalleled, and the camera work is incredible. This movie is worth buying and watching just to see the one scene in which Victor McLaglen prompts his recruits to ride ""after the manner of the ancient Romans."" This and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" contain scenes of horsemanship that all the special effects of modern movies could never top."
3,Great Buy,If you love John Wayne & Western films. This is your movie. Great Quality. I am not happy there no subtitles. But otherwise. It's a good watch.
4,NO COLOR!!!,Rio Grande is a great John Wayne Movie but specks say color. I was expecting a colorized version. Still a great black and white movie if thats what you want.
4,Excellent,"Hey , Its a John Wayne movie. Need we say more. Its a classic for all western movie buffs and wanna be Cavalry Men everywhere."
5,Great Movie,"If you like John Wayne you will like this movie. As always ""The Duke"" is big, bold and there is lots of action."
3,"It's the riders, stupid!","While this might not be the greatest movie of all time, anyone interested in horseback riding must see young Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. performing masterfully in Roman riding. Just this scene is worth the price of the video"
1,crap because on this blu ray all the special features are missing,do not buy this on blu ray from olive films because it sayes it has special features on the blu ray. so when you go to watch the blu ray itself the blu ray contains no special features. so please do not waste your money buying this product.
1,Black & white,"I ordered this thinking it would be in color. For over $14 I would expect it. I should have sent it back. Never watched it since it was black and white movie. If I could get my money back now, I would. I was just too busy to deal with sending it back. I won't ever make that mistake again.Very disappointed"
3,Rio Grande,"One of the many ""Rio"" movies made by John ""Duke"" Wayne. This one is not the typical good vs evil that was his standard. Rio Grande brings out the cruel side of his character that later movies hardly ever showed. The acting is excellent, but the story line is not what one expects from a John Wayne western. The supporting cast does a great job, but can't keep the audience from wishing that the lead character would just ride off into the sunset...and stay there."
5,"New 50th Anniversary Edition ""Rio Grande"" O'Hara commentary",...Producer/Director Michael Gillis is to be applauded for finally gave us a special of edition of these films with Maureen O'Hara given free reign in detailed commentary. There is even an enhanced audio version that has Ms. O'Hara narrating throughout the entire movie with little side stories and facts that are simply delightful. This is a must for film buffs and historians - if you don't have a DVD player - go out and get one. IT IS WONDERFUL!
5,"Last of the ""U.S. Cavalry"" Trilogy","I'd say 4-1/2 stars. Why? I watched the ""trilogy"" one after the other and by now a bit of surrealism had taken over. That's to director John Ford's advantage. (Ever notice there aren't many closeups in this movie?) Of the 3, this has the slightest story, but let's not quibble; John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Ben Johnson are all here in their inimitable glory. As is Monument Valley. Thanks, folks."
4,Rio Grande (blu-ray),I was glad to see this movie released in (blu-ray) but I think that the quality of the print could have been a little better.It seems to have a wash-out look to it in places. Maybe in the near future they can use a little better print to release to blu-ray).I'm still very glad to have this.
5,The last of the trilogy,"This is the last film in the John Wayne/John Ford/cavalry trilogy. If you are a fan of the films of John Wayne and/or John Ford this series of film need no introduction, if you are not familiar with these films by all means but all three and watch a master director and John Wayne at his best. Rio Grande is generally considered the least of the trilogy, but it is my favorite of the three. No other director ever put his stamp so completely on westerns as did John Ford; when you watch this film check out the ripples on the water, the night sounds, the clouds, the horizon. This is a beautiful film with all of the John Ford company of players at their peak."
5,great Mothers Day gift,"I love this!!! My husband says our son bought this for me for Mothers' Day... our son is 9 months old!! I love the way we can use Amazon for surprises for each other. I love this pendant! It is easy to see that it is a boy, he has a little smile on his face, and oh how it sparkles!!!"
3,maybe to loud,seem to work as you would want but maybe to loud for quiet place unless you dont mind most adults knowing what that sound is.
1,Several Fake Reviews for this Item,"Beware, the star rating on this item has been inflated by several fake reviews. If you look carefully, you'll notice that about 20% of the reviews (most of the 5-star ratings) were all posted on August 19, and use almost identical language.Ignore them, they're unrealistic."
2,ehh,Purchased this product for my wife. The vibrator is just a little too louder for most places we go. It spends more time sitting on bottom of toy box. I suggest spending this type of money on something you can get daily use out of with the misses. Such as a hitachi magic wand.
3,Works great and as expected. Its just a little cheap.,"It works very well, if not a little too well. The vibration is quite a lot for a discrete item, but when my girlfriend and I used it in public we couldn't hear anything. There is an on/off switch that a certain lucky person gets and an energetic vibrating bullet for the other. One complaint is that it was louder than I wanted, but the only time you can't really use it is when it is dead silent. Also, there is a distinct cheap feel, especially with the remote. I'm worried the switch will break easily and when you take the battery cover off, you can see the very cheap design. Same goes for the panties mostly, but each works how it is supposed to. All around I'm happy with my purchase and this item is a lot of fun!"
1,Very poor product,"This product worked for only a few hours over the period of less than a week and completely quit. I have contacted the company twice by email for assistance and have received no response. A product originally priced at $100 and on sale for $52 should be more reliable and last longer than 6 days. Also the company has a responsibility to its customers to be responsive to communications from its customers. Based on my experience, my advice would be for Amazon to discontinue advertising a product manufactured by a company that has no intentions to satisfy or even cares about the satisfaction of their customers. If they had only taken the time to respond to my emails which were sent within 10 days of the delivery date, my opinion would be significantly different."
4,"a little constricting, but still a good time","whether you're in class, a meeting, in the car, or on the job, nothing will get you through your day like a pair of vibrating panties. my only complaint is that it was a bit constricting on the 'junk'. I had to move the good to the side sometimes for a little breather. but it definitely gets the job done, although clean up can be a little messy. Highly recommended"
5,Essential,The title says it all! This book is essential. I have it by my computer at the ready. The items in this book are not a new wheel but a way to make the current wheel look smarter and sleeker and give you an edge. Order one for yourself at home and perhaps even one for work!
4,Must Have Book,This is a must have easy to read book that Mac users should have in their library. It provides helpful tips on how to make your designs look professional and help out with the work flow.
4,A packet of diamonds!,"Don't let the size of this book fool you. It is must reading for any Mac user, and for that matter for any Windows user today. Basic concepts that aren't covered elsewhere and make using the computer so much easier. I look forward to the revised version coming out November 15, 2001."
5,Love these!,I had an Honors project where I had to visualize to an audience how I was writing a children's book. These were an amazing find! I loved that they were loose-leaf and large in size. It made it nice to display art work and attach to a black poster board. My project looked amazing! Thank you!
3,Tough hero to like,"This was first book in the Carlotta Carlyle series that I read. I might yet read another, but if so I'm not sure it will be because of Carlotta herself. Lots of lead characters in mystery novels are bitterish and depressed, but Carlotta seems to take the cake. Excusing the awful pun with the title of the novel, its like she's got the ""weight of the world"" on her shoulders.Carlotta does have a neat side in that she's got her faults, e.g. falling for the wrong guys; doesn't win all her fights etc. This makes her refreshingly original. But what I thought made this a good read overall and may lead me to pick up others in the series is a neat plot; an overall neat cast of supporting characters (with some bizarre inclusions); and a thrilling (somewhat farfetched) ""James Bondish"" finale."
3,As Good as Gold,"Wanted children have middle names, but not Paolina Fuentes. She is fortunate in being the little sister of Carlotta Carlyle, Private Investigator. She has been missing for five days. A complication is that Paolina is the daughter of a supposed Colombian drug lord.Carlotta travels to Miami pursuing a lead. While in Florida she remains in contact with friends and associates in Boston, hoping that someone or something has developed illuminating Paolina's disappearance. Carlotta is directed by a police source to an outfit doing digital scans. There is a hit. A passenger to Bogata several days ago resembles Paolina.I cannot in good conscience detail further ramifications of this well-executed plot. Suffice to say that there is much excitement. The Boston connections comprise some of the more interesting aspects of Linda Barnes's Carlotta Carlyle mystery stories."
5,We never did this stuff at Girl Scout camp...,"If you've ever wondered what a women's music festival is all about, who goes and what really happens there, then this book is a must. With wonderfully visual anecdotes, quotes and stories from performers, festi-goers, producers and techies, as well as the histories of festivals themselves, ""Eden Built By Eves"" will take you on the journey without having to pack up the car! Whether you're a ""festie-virgin"" and have never been, or a seasoned veteran of the phenomena that is this culture, this book will make you wish you had planned to take the Summer off just so that you could attend each festival described. Amid the history and politics, controversies and laughter, sometimes painful truths and hilarious stories, you'll meet the women of the festival world who have helped to create this amazing culture. Buy this book and be prepared to stay up late reading it. You'll be very glad you did!"
2,Full of Holes,"Well, this cd was a bit of a disappointment. I figured it would be one raging metal trip from begining to end. Wrong. There are several songs that are just too slow and boring for Sepultura. Also, the whole theme is worked into the cd too much. They need to concentrate on the music more, not the lyrics. Sepulnation is a cool track along with about 2 others. The rest is either boring or annoying. The singer is unimpressive. During some songs, he just ""talks"" like it's some kind of intermission and his voice is simply horrible."
2,It's not Sepultura without Max Cavalera,"Max Cavalera was the heart and soul of Sepultura, without him the remainded of the band has lost an irreplacible piece of the puzzle. Derrick Green is not a bad vocalist in fact his voice is probably better than Max's. But the intensity and urgency (and overall message in the music) is no longer present. Andres, Paulo, and Igor are still fantastic musicians but Max's neo-fanatacism anchored Sepultura. Nation sounds like both a rehash of old Sepultura riffs ala Chaos AD and a meld of Nu-Metal. Sepultura is still one of my favorite metal bands just not this incarnation. Beneath the Remains and Arise are the two must have albums from the Real Sepultura, this cd is just riding the Sepultura name into the ground."
2,Metal to sleep by....,"Sepultura was one of the first heavy bands I ever listened too, I first picked up roots and was blown away by the innovative mix of tribal and metal. I listened to Against and could tell something was missing, recently I picked up Nation and was not impressed and sorely let down by this album. Sepultura has gone soft and lost all creativity and innovation since Max left after roots. The songs are slow and tame with some flare ups every now and then, nothing like the sepultura of the past. (especially if you have been listening to them since their first albums) Roots probably was and will be sepultura's last good album for a long time to come. Even the artwork on this album lacks creativity, it's done in a similar style to the artwork of KMFDM.If you're looking for the sound of the older sepultura, look elsewhere, it's not here."
2,Some good songs.....,"see, by now i really dig AGAINST...It's in the same vein of ROOTS...but NATION is the SEP album that i really don't care much....Must be the less inspired album from SEPULTURA...well, it's my opinion....after NATION and ROORBACK, the band lost the attention from the masses....DANTE and A-LEX are so great!!!!! Unfortunatelly, the best thing from Brazil, SEPULTURA recorded NATION and ROORBACK before DANTE and A-LEX.....this one got some good songs, but check DANTE and A-LEX!!!"
3,its ok,"Forget about chaos ad - arise - beneath the remains. This album looks like Roots With a sense of Machine head (but the riffs are very simple - don't expect thrash music to make you headbanging because of its passion). Its just ok - nothing more , nothing less"
2,Great musicians... poor music,"I bought this album with about 8 other albums of all styles (Napalm Death, Toadies, Nile, etc...) After an 11 hour drive in my car and much music playing this album fell to the bottom of the pile and never made it back. This thing just falls short of doing anything for me. Only two songs here that cover any new ground... the rest is just filler/rehash/boring. I know it's tough to not buy a new Sepultura album, but if your favorite one is Beneath The Remains.... do yourself a favor and leave this one alone. I wish I had. I even have a Sepultura tattoo and I wish I hadn't bought this album!"
4,a great comeback comeback (yes 2 times),"While ""Against"" was their comeback album without Max at the helm, this release is their comeback from that disappointment. And what Against lacked NATION makes up ten-fold. A much thicker, heavier guitar tone is welcome. Drums are sounding nice and bassy again and Paulo Jr.s bass is as thunderous as ever. Of course Derrick Greene is no Max, but the adjustments the band made in sound makes Greene fit like a glove, Derrick's clean voice is very effective and a great addition. The best way to describe this album is: CHAOS A.D. I am not kidding, listen to it and you will see the similarities. This album is much more easier and better to get into due to it being more METAL. 1 star off because Igor said there were 2 very fast thrash songs on here, yes there are, but they are each under a minute. RIP OFF. But its still great."
4,"Tops ""Against"" in every way","Many longtime Sepultura fans didn't (and some still haven't) taken a liking to Derrick Green: the new voice of Sepultura replacing Max Cavalera. Sepultura's first album with Green, ""Against"", saw the band struggling with Green, but their second album with him, 2001's ""Nation"", finds the group more closely molded together and Green finally cleansing himself of the title ""Max Cavalera's replacement"". Green's barking, roaring voice sounds great, and the Igor Cavalera's drums haven't sounded this good in years. Standout tracks include ""Sepulnation"", ""Revolt"", ""One Man Army"", ""Tribe to a Nation"", ""Reject"", and ""Water""; all of which are better than many of the songs found on ""Against"". The only real flaw with ""Nation"" is the same flaw that plagued ""Against"": the rhythm section suffers without Max Cavalera's guitar, but other than that, this is solid. All in all, if you were disappointed with ""Against"", then checkout ""Nation"" or they're latest ""Roorback""."
2,Dullsville,"I guess if I wanted sub-Slayer thrash with a deeper vocals, muddy guitar lines and a production that reeks of utter modern mediocrity, I might buy this.But that's not what I want. As such, I don't particularly recommend this album. It's not absolute junk, but it's very, very sub-par."
2,Uninspired,"With the genre, you can expect the vocals and soloing to suck. No surprises there but I had expected better in terms of riffs or hooks. Nothing. It's not a terrible album (if you like the genre) but it has little/nothing to offer. Save your money and listen to your old Pantera albums."
3,"Good, but it's not Sepultura","This cd is ok. It has some decent songs and Hatebreed's Jamey Jasta makes a guest appearance. Musically , it's great. Igor's beats as always are incredible, and Derreck Green really has an awesome voice. I would probably have liked this more if it didn't have Sepultura's name on it, because it really does not live up to Sepultura's legacy. Guys, give your fans what they want: put aside your differences and get back with Max!!Oh, one more comment that makes me feel bad for Derreck Green. I saw Sepultura on tour for this album with Hatebreed and Vision of Disorder. Sep comes onstage and almost immediately about half the crowd starts screaming ""WE WANT MAX!!"" Very disrespectful of Derreck but so true at the same time . . ."
4,One NATION under Derrick,"Ok, this disc is not 'Beneath the Remains' or 'Chaos A.D.'; if that's what you're expecting you should probably buy those discs. 'Nation' shows that Sepultura are for real and still showing power and direction with new vox Derrick, whose harsh voice fits nicely into the bands pummeling and often tribal music. 'Sepulnation' and 'One Man Army' are the standout points of the disc while the rest is more killer than filler. Soulfly seems to be just mainly Max while Sepultura are four focused individuals who are gaining respect and momentum with every note. Seeing them at Tattoo The Earth was even more proof that Sepultura w/Derrick is definately a force in the metal scene!"
4,Not for the Nostalgic Primus fan,"Primus has been around for a while, and those hardcore fans that were digusted by the Brown album will find this one to be no better, but face it, until Herb comes to his senses and drums for them agian, it ain't gonna be the same. Those of you (like me) who say Primus still sucks as great as they have for years will see this as an interesting exploration into waters touched on in Rinoplasty. It has a much harder edge, and by the looks of it, Les has been able to cange and yet stay the same at the same time. It isn't the best and isn't the worst. For real Primus action, get Sailing the Seas of Cheese."
2,doesnt live up to primus's high standards!,"Okay so as much as i love primus, i was really dissapointed when i got this cd! get it if you really want, but id recommend one of thier other cd's instead. brown album is their best!!!!"
4,How bout that bassist?,Durn man...i wasn't expecting to like this band when i first listned to some samples but man once i heard the bass parts putting together this funk junk man i loved it
4,Anti Pop-Right Case Wrong CD,We received our order ontime & in excellent condtion. Only a small problem however.Right case but wrong cd enclosed. We kept it because he loves ALL of Primus.
2,Not very good - don't waste your money,"Antipop is Primus trying to be something else. As the title indicates, they wanted nothing to do with pop - like every band in 1999. The guitar is more present here than on earlier albums, which doesn't come as a suprise because that was the sound back then - loud, simple guitarwork (see Limp Bizkit). Les is still an amazing bassist on Antipop, though. The problem is, everything besides the basslines sound too simple and boring. This album is faceless compared to albums like Pork Soda. My advice - buy an earlier album instead."
4,A New Side Of Primus,"Well, what can I say. I feel in love with this album as soon as I put it in my Cd player and turned up Electric Uncle Sam. However, compared to earlier primus albums, AntiPop takes on a heavier more serious side. For the most part Les Claypool's voice is not as squeaky and fun as it is in say the brown Album or Pork Soda. Still, the bass is enough to shake the cd player right out of your hand, and this is classic Primus. The band lashes out on ""Electric Electric"" feauturing Metallica's James Hetfield, who I require you turn up your headphones for on his solo midway through the song. The ""Antipop"" is another brilliant song. ""Mama didn't raise no fool"" has Morello from Rage let lose riffs as Claypool repeats ""mama didn't raise no fool"" in his typical Les Claypool voice. Overall, this is a new side of Primus, and I really like it. I'm looking forward to their next album, and can't imagine what that will sound like."
3,"OK, but not as ""inspired"" as Seas of Cheese.","Alot of bassists like Primus and I'm no exception, but this album is a far cry from ""Sailing"". The vocals are strange in a bad way. Awesome bass playing as always but sort of lack a hook. The intros and sound effects are below standard. I can't help it, I'm alittle disapointed."
3,So-so,There seems to be a mixed opinion on this album. I have all of Primus' previous albums but never have they lived up to sea's of cheese. This is no exception. Every album since has delivered 2 or 3 cracking songs but they are yet to produce a consistently good album.
2,Primus is Out of Ideas,"The boys must be out of ideas for new songs. Instead of writing REAL Primus stuff, they've apparently decided to abandon their dedicated long-time fans by writing stuff to appeal to Korn and Limp Bizkit fans. They've done this by bringing in various individuals to help them produce songs. Aside from Tom Waits, this was generally a bad idea.Granted there are four really cool songs on here (The Antipop, Final Voyage of the Liquid Sky, Coattails of a Dead Man, and the secret song (a studio version of The Heckler)), it's not Primus at the peak of their existence as many reviews made this out to be.Bottom line: If you're a new Primus fan (got in to Primus during or after the Punchbowl years), you'll probably dig this album. If you've been in with Primus for the long haul as I have, this is just an album to keep Tales from the Punchbowl and The Brown Album company in the mediocre catagory."
3,Missing the Seas of Cheese,"I own every other Primus album and was excited about this one. When I got it, I was very disappointed. Les is a great musician and writer, but it's more rough-edge than it used to be. HIs lyrics used to be comical and satyrical, now they're sounding more punkish. I miss the days of D'Anza Jigs."
5,PRIMUS DOES IT AGAIN!,"Primus, a band that always makes good albums. Primus prove to be one of the most creative, smartest, and well... oddist bands ever. ANTIPOP is a awesome album, I waited so long for this album to be released. BROWN ALBUM was a very good album in which alot of so called ""primus fans"" say wasn't good. It was good, but ANTIPOP indeed is a better album. Every song on this album is good, and has its own unique style. The higher points for me are ""electric uncle sam"", ""laquer head"", ""the antipop"", ""electic eletric"", and ""greet the sacred cow."" The album has some cool guest's like Rage Against The Machine's genius guitar player Tom Morello guesting on some tracks. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!! PRIMUS HAVE SAVED ROCK MUSIC!"
3,Disappointing,"I've spent years trying to get into this album and aside form a few tracks, I just can't. Haters of the Brown Album should have their head examined because this album doesn't even come close to it."
4,Primus returns.,"The Brown Album Part Two, this is not. And, thank goodness for that. Primus returns to form on Antipop. First and foremost, Primus plays, or overplays if you like. Gone is the advance towards simplicity. The band returns to it's over-the-top musicianship. And, at the forefront, is Les Claypool; quirky, unconventional and, well, fantastic. Love 'em or hate 'em, Les makes an impression. And, this album not only reinforces his stance as a wonderful bass player, but puts Primus back on the musical map."
4,Is More Better?,"This is a great cd. It is different from the others becausethey worked with countless other artists instead of doing the independent thing. I have to say that the the songs featuring other artists are good, but they aren't Primus style. I'm not saying it is bad, but if you are looking for a purly Primus cd, this isn't it. There are great Primus songs, but the ones with Tom Morello really sound like ""Rage Against the Primus"". So more is variety, but it isn't better."
5,What can i say,"As far as comparing this to other Primus albums, i wouldnt dare. The idea of comparing Primus albums is like comparing Tarantino movies. They all leave you thinking how could this get any better, then they do. Antipop definitely shows a lot more of Les's darker, more intense side, with a more driven lead bass than we've seen with previous releases such as Sailing The Seas or Punchbowl, but Primus still retains their hauntingly beautiful quirk metal that has set them apart from mainstream since Frizzle Fry. As always, Lers schreeching guitar perfectly supplements the nasal psychotic vocals/purely awe-inspiring bass of Les Claypool and Brains flawless sense of offbeat rythym. Primus is one of those bands that ou can rest assured will just keep getting better and better."
5,Primus bowls another strike,"This CD showcases Primus as a band that can really rock and be really weird at the same time. Many fans of ""classic"" Primus, such as their earliest (and best) album, Frizzle Fry, might not enjoy it as much, because Primus veers away from its roots a little and tries out a different sound. Les and Ler stray from the funk of other CDs and move toward hard rock licks (though this new style still shows Primus's technical proficiency). Overall, this is a superior Primus album that, in my mind, is second only to Frizzle Fry in its distinctive sound and creativity."
4,PRIMUS RULE,"Although i'm not a big fan and this is the only Primus album i own, Les Claypool is a bit of a god on that bass!! the album is very funky and although it is not a regular in my CD player i understand why it certainly is 4 some people!!anyway thats all i'm gonna say but if u r reading this review it probably means that u want 2 buy the CD - so go on u wont regret!!"
4,Claypool's Mama Didn't Raise No Fool,"Contrary to the disc's subversive title, this is actually the most straightforward release Primus has given us in years. The production really shines here - every note of every instrument is crystal clear, and the end result is something that sounds more like the work of a concerted group effort than that of a mad genius. Tom Morello's guitar work is a welcome bonus, and Tom Waits is always a treat. Perhaps not as adventurous as some of the Cheeseboys' previous efforts (you decide whether that's a good thing or not), but this is a solid, rockin' album which, as others here have noted, often harkens back to the days of Frizzle Fry. Buy it!"
4,A Definite Must for Rachel Fans,"I just picked this CD up, direct from Stiff Records (before Amazon even had it listed). While it doesn't include any cuts from her Columbia albums, it contains just about all the songs off of ""Fool Around"" and ""Protect the Innocent"" (superior albums in my opinion anyway). As an added bonus, it contains Rachel's take on ""Be Stiff"".Since the ""Protect the Innocent"" and her previous Rhino compilation (which was basically ""Fool Around"" plus a couple songs) are no longer available on CD, this CD is a good buy for any Rachel fan. It includes her slow songs plus her country songs (both of which are my preference), but it has her new wave songs as well...a good cross section.Rachel, if you're out there...how about recording again...or at least coming back to Akron, Ohio for a concert!"
5,Hailstones and Halibut Bones,"This is an excellent book, Great artwork and the poetry sings with all the magic of God's creation, a great book for all ages."
5,A Wonderful Introduction to Poetry,"I discovered this wonderful poetry book years ago in the waiting area of my children's pediatrician, and it became a routine for us to read it while we were waiting for the doctor to come in. We finally just had to buy our own copy. Using rich and evocative language, Mary O'Neill has created a series of twelve color poems. The pictures by John Wallner perfectly match the mood of the poetry.Ranging from purple: ""Time is purple/Just before night..."", through black: ""Black is beauty/In its deepest form..."", on to blue: ""Blue is the scarf/Spring wears on her shoulder..."", and concluding with yellow, ""Yellow's a topaz/A candle flame..."", Hailstones and Halibut Bones is a poetry book that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike."
5,Bravo,Excellent for young and old alike. Mrs. O'Neill was the first person to describe color to those who cannot see and for those who are sighted she added a dimension to our appreciation of color. I will never look at purple the same again.
3,A little color added to my face,"Is cute. Haven't given it as much wear as would've liked. Simple, see, the nipple rings are blue, and though love the color, I've enough to color me in such a manner, and I kinda try having more than 1/3 of my rings a certain color at any one time."
5,If you like Design Patterns and efficient programming,"Certainly a wonderful book coming at a very appropriate time, when people write more complex code for various devices. There is a certain gap in the industry in the embedded software field, where object oriented techniques and patterns are not always part of the arsenal of the developers. This book successfully bridges this gap and provides many useful examples as well as proofs for the ideas presented there. The requirements for the reader seem to require some C++ (and/or) Java , but all object oriented programmers and even traditional C users can benefit from it. There is some inclination from the authors to provide more examples from EPOC, rather than more diverse examples but that is not always the case. I recommend the book for the patterns enthusiast as well as the curious software engineer who wants to have a broader vision in his/her software development practices."
1,Impossible to get these things to germinate,"I have been tending to my seeds for over three months, following the instructions carefully (rainwater or distilled water only -- no tap or spring water) and so far, nothing has sprouted from the domed egg-shaped container. All my other plants, which I began germinating the same time, have grown and flowered beautifully. But this venus fly trap is stubborn. It will not grow.The package looked enticing and I bought into it. There were only 3 seeds in my pack (even though the kit claims that 4-5 would be included). They were very tiny black dots similar to poppy seeds, but much smaller and more oval. I had to make sure my hands were completely dry before handling these to prevent ""sticking"" and so they could be dropped easily into the soil.But alas, after much waiting, watching and hoping, nothing has grown. For anyone thinking about buying this, you're better off buying a plant that's already grown."
1,DOES NOT FIT STOKKE CRIB!!!,"This product claims that it fits the Stokke crib however it DOES NOT! It is a standard sheet that fits a standard fitted crib. It does ""fit"" on the stokke mattress but it is not tight fitting and there is tons of extra material. I would not recommend this sheet at all. I am returning mine as it does not fit my oval Stokke crib."
3,A flawed yet beautiful jewelry box with a lovely tune,"This lovely box was ALMOST all I could have hoped for - classic simplicity, a medium size, the rich look of burlwood and inlay, and a classic tune one doesn't usually hear in music boxes these days. I was so taken by it that I ignored one obvious flaw: one of the bottom feet is not secure and swings around. Please note, I did not contact the company for a refund because I noticed this flaw a couple of weeks later. It was my own fault in assuming the box would have hinges that hold the top up, but the hinges do not do that. Wish I had gotten it at a lower price."
4,An expose of misdeeds by our leaders,"This is a good book that exposes a lot of the misdeeds of our leaders with an emphasis on Iraq and East Timor. With so much written about East Timor, it is truly amazing that nothing has ever been done to Kissinger. This book makes that point as well. Another strong issue is why, as Americans, any of us should be wary of questioning our goverment. This is right that our system entitles us to and the author shouts this in her book several times. This book should be a requirement for students and Amy should come in and speak in classrooms."
5,True Lies,"Amy is not only well informed about the truth behind today's politicians, she is not afraid to write and speak about it.This book is a must for everyone who wants to find out how the media is run in the US and also the special interests which are the wheels of the US government. This book should be required reading for all high schools and universities."
2,Almost tolerable,"Goodman claims to be independent but she is largely just parroting the talking points of the Democrats. Still, I give her two stars instead of one because she does occasionally show signs of intelligence and integrity."
1,A Very Big Disappointment,"I've listened to Amy a few times on the radio and found her a bit shrill, but interesting. I bought her book after I heard her speak recently while I was in Southern California and her book is just plain shrill. In fact, it isn't much of a book at all. It seems a bunch of conspiracy theory thrown together to cash in on all the anti-Bush publishing bonanza of the moment. The intellectual level of the book was suprisingly low. It was much more like a pamphlet than a serious read. Also, her main point that we are all kept in the dark by the corporate media just doesn't hold up. Look at the world of hurt that Bush and Rumsfield are currently in-- and that's from the networks, not from Amy's show. I'd spend my next twenty-five bucks on something more substantial."
5,a must read,this book is a must read for any Elvis fan. the book is very good. it is only about 110 pages long but is well worth the short read. anyone who wants to read a postive book on Elvis this is it.
5,Works great!,"I got excellent fast delivery, no problems & the pump is very good. Must be powerful because my husband has opted to use it on his TRUCK instead of the little electric one you plug into the lighter outlet. He topped off the tires very quickly and he originally just wanted this for the small tires on his hand truck & cart. Everyone should have one of these to keep their vehicle's tires at optimum pressure and save gas. The price was GREAT - less than half of what I saw in the hardware store."
1,Tinkertoy,"Useless piece of junk (I only rated it one star because you can't rate it zero). Item did arrive on time, but I thought at first it was a wrong item. The pump barrel is half-length, the handle is way short of flimsy and the plunger rod bends if you just look at it. Valve is schrader only, no presta. This isn't a bicycle pump, much less a floor pump. Worst of all, for $10 you'll just toss it out, because it isn't worth the time or effort to get a refund. Don't waste your time with this item. (I suspect the other review from ""overly happy Polly"" is a fake)."
2,has not aged well,"The cover of House of the rising sun is a minor classic,a couple of ok blues tunes,but the rest of the disc isn't as good as it may have seemed 30 years ago when I first bought the album.Belongs in the cut-out bin."
3,Dated,"I hate to be the devils advocate but here it goes---most of this record aside from the ""House of The Rising Sun"" sounds very dated. There's nothing here remotely in the same league as The Stooges or The MC5 so to lump Frijid Pink in this group is somewhat misleading--not that all is bad--just dated. Most of the songs are fairly strong blues based numbers that sounded right on the money in 1971 its just that now listening to it some 20 years since I last heard it there seems to be a post hippy come flower child thread running through the entire record except for the excellent rendition of ""Rising Sun"". I dunno maybe I'm jaded--judge for yourself..."
4,The life of a woman who should be a legend,"I picked up this book at a thrift shop - my usual venue for book purchases - solely due to the title. I knew nothing of Mary Kingsley prior to reading this absorbing account of her life. Her childhood and early adult life would give no clue to the extraordinary adventures she would have in Africa, culminating in her death while serving as a nurse with the British Army in South Africa. Rudyard Kipling said of her that she was ""the bravest person I know"" - I hope I have the quote correct. I cannot check as I gave my copy of the book to a friend who bears a striking resemblance to Miss Kingsley."
3,Short little book but worth a read.,"Glasser examines the idea of Positive Addiction with running at the very centre of the book. Book is not that long, but tends to be somewhat repetitive... but still worth a read. Not Glasser's best book but even at that, the ideas he shares are good.. and the positive addiction idea does trickle into other parts of life, so that someone who is positively addicted to running or swimming or cycling, tends to feel better and can take that good feeling to other things they do. If people became more positively addicted to good relations with others... WOW! what an outcome that would be..and (third time said) Book is well worth a read.."
3,Another Nick Salomon creation,"Ever since Nick Salomon, alias Bevis Frond, hit the studio, he has been producing great pieces of music. Although this recording is not as ""refreshing"" as the earlier ones (like Miasma, Bevis through the Looking Glass), it is another fine work of art in the Bevis style."
4,Excellent theatre biography,Billie Whitelaw has written a very intelligent autobiography. Her painful memories of her childhood during World War II in England are very interesting. Her experiences in the theatre and some of the great actors she has worked with are a theatre goers delight. She also tells of a painful marriage with a great deal of candor. Well worth reading by a classy lady.
5,Good Source of Movie Themes for Modern Science Fiction Films,"Side A: Movie themes from Blade Runner, 2001-A Space Odyssey, Alien, Return of the Jedi, Star Wars, E.T., Black Hole, Silent Moon, and Die Unendliche GeschichteSide B: Movie themes from Battlestar Galactica, Das Arche Noah Prinzip, Raumpatrouille Orion, Time Tunnel, Twilight Zone, Star Trek, Close Encounters, War of the Worlds, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Frost."
1,It's a sales pitch for only books,I was expecting a lot more insightful and specific information. It just kept referring to other books by the author.
5,comfortable and cute,"This is the second pair of these boots I have purchased, and my only regret is that I didn't get more. Stylish, great fit, what more can you ask for"""
3,misleading..,i thought from the description i would be getting 12 diffrent sissors... wrong oh well still a good sturdy pair.
3,Not for real,"I'm going to review, not the book, but its dubious claim as ""the first"" book on fandom. Since I have about five titles on my shleves that predate this title. ALL OUR YESTERDAYS, A WEALTH OF FABLE--both by Harry Warner Jr., THE IMMORTAL STORM, by Sam Moskowitz, THE FUTURIANS by Damon Knight, and AH! SWEET IDIOCY, by F. Towner Laney. There are a few others that I don't recall right now.I'll remove my review after the information is corrected."
5,Just Plain Fun,"For a guy who can't really sing, Eddie Tudor-Pole sure can write a catchy tune! I first heard these guys when I bought the Stiff Records Box Set (another 5-star compilation) and fell in love with ""3 Bells In A Row"" and ""Throwing My Baby Out With the Bathwater"". If you're familiar with either of these tunes, this comp is just that times 10. It's drunken, punky, singalong British rock at its finest. You'll have every tune memorized by the end of the first listen. I'm listening to it now, and wearing an ear-to-ear grin. If you are a fan of The Damned, The Rumour or any of that ilk, buy this!"
5,learning strategies are a big help,Someone told me about this book and how it teaches kids learning strategies. It does it with a story to get their interest. I've been using the ideas in this book and they are a big help. It can help any kid but especially one with LD. The writer has a website with free stuff that helps a lot too.
1,kim Boring,I do not like the art work or the book cover. I like a book that makes me laugh and I can learn from. It seems like the kid has a problem I cannot relate to this book.
1,News Flah: Boring,"I have read over 80 books about Paris in the last year (can you spell ""obsession?""). Some were riviting (Luncheon of the Boat Party). Some were silly (Paris Hangover). Some were a hard read (France: A History). None of them were boring. Until now. This was an indescribably minute and rambling remembrance of every American journalist that was in Paris during the Fabulous Twenties, the time of the Lost Generation, debauchery, and fine writing. I had hoped to read something as illuminating as Malcom Crowley's ""Exile's Return."" Instead I read a phone book listing of journalists, with a few tidbits along the way. I couldn't even finish it. I'm sorry I bought it. The other seventy-nine were so much better."
3,Old News,"Aimed at readers with an acute interest in U.S. journalists, papers and magazines in Paris between the great wars I and II. Paris itself is just a pale backdrop to the main story.I found the book choppy in presentation, with but an average writing style.Like the history of any given narrow enterprise or discrete period, it will be great fun for those who were there or, as more likely here given the passage of time, their descendents. For most general readers of today, there is not much related in this book that will be of lasting interest."
5,Great book!,"My 15-month-old loves this book! It's always the first one he brings me, and every page gets a big smile."
5,Cherished by my child,"Although the pictures are not my favorite (I find they are rather ugly), it is a book I am so happy to have. My son loves it and is so exicted to ""read"" it himself, laughing as I say the phrases and he finds a page to match. As early as 10/11 months he is really engaged by this peek-a-boo book. Board Book material is rather easily chewed though."
3,Works but doesn't last long,"We installed this about 18 months ago. It was a quick, effective, recommended solution to make our garage more air-tight. But the vinyl is now all cracked, dried out and streaked (we live in sunny North Dallas). Very unattractive and needs to be replaced. It'll be a hassle pulling out all of the brads. Not looking forward to this project. We won't be replacing this with the same product."
1,Worthless piece of software,"Wanted to give taxcut a try. I got the CD and installed it. Software needs online update. Online update was not available because the server was too busy. It would not even start without the update. The update also requires proxy setting change. It is too much hassle to use it. Doing tax is frustrated enough, using this software made it even worse. Do not buy it."
2,Save money and do taxes the old way,"I am so glad that I didn't depend on the numbers Tax-Cut state gave me. I saved another $100 in taxes by just doing it by hand. I don't know where the software botched up. The 2 stars are because it was easy to use, and I liked their 'help' contents."
2,Wisconsin TaxCut,Couldn't get Schedule H prepared correctly. TaxCut customer service was of no help.
1,Basic Forms aren't too much to expect.. Are they?,"I tried to submit my State return using this product and it informed me that it didn't have the form I needed. But this must have been somewhat intentional, because it knew which form I needed and where to get it! The entire point in buying the software was so I could E-file, and now I can't, and I'm still out $25!The federal Program was good, so if you live in an area without State taxes, then TaxCut could be your program. But stay away from State!"
2,Incorrect Taxable Income,"I have used TaxCut for the past three years and never had trouble until this year. Be careful to look closely at how TaxCut handles direct IRA rollovers. It pulled the rollover amount (instead of the taxable rollover amount -- $0) in as taxable on my state form. I ended up having to file a hard copy because of this, and went around the block 6 times with the support staff to try and get them to recognize that there was an issue. They never did."
2,Incorrect Taxable incom for Mississippi State Tax,Mississippi does not tax retirement income from the military but the program pulled the full retirement from the 1099-R into the state as taxable income causing the miscalculation of the refund amount. I called and could not get intouch with them so I did an online chat and they refered my case to research and were to get back to me in 24-48 hours and they have not in over 8 days now. I can overide the error but can not file electronically if I do.
3,"A good source book, but Hirum Beebe isn't the Sundance Kid.","Mr. Kirby was able to interview some original sources, so a lot of the information is good. But, NONE of the WOLA ""Western Outlaw and Lawmen association historians agree with Kirby that Hirum Beebe was the Sundance Kid. No resemblance of any kind between the two the real ""Kid"" arrested in late 1880's was 5ft 10inches tall, Beebe was 5ft 4inches +/-, and no facial features match."
4,Ringo the Storyteller,"It's been a few years since ""Christmas Time is Here Again"" but the beatles sound is still around with this new holiday release from Ringo Starr. The music sounds a lot like the Vertical Man album, and Ringo breathes new life into the lyrics of songs such as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.He has a unique storytelling ability, does ringo. I heard these christmas songs in a whole new light, really hearing the lyrics for the first time. A great gift for christmas, and will sound good for years to come"
1,Dark Starr,"No one is a bigger Beatles fan than I am, but after the demise of the group, it became clear that Ringo should stay behind the drums and not behind a microphone. This album is dull and ordinary, and Ringo's vocals are as hit-and-miss as ever. The new Christmas songs are insipid, and the production is unimaginative. A real disappointment."
5,Wake Up Christmas!,"This is a jump-out-of-your-chair, dance around the room album that will wake up your ho-hum collection and put a big smile on your face! From the kicking first track to the international celebration at the end, this is a 12-pack of winners. Little nods to that 'other' group, and some spiced up favorites add to the fun. Buy this album!"
3,MOST of it is fun!,"Well, it sounds like Ringo had fun making this CD. It's the fun songs that are the best, but there are a few other songs that are major flops. He opens the disc trying to sound like Gary Glitter on ""Come On Christmas."" And he closes it trying (and failing) to sound like George Harrison on ""Pax Um Biscum"", which is a misguided attempt at Eastern mysticism. Also, ""Christmas Eve"" exposes Ringo as a weak ballad singer. He does, however, do a decent job reworking the Beatles only complete Christmas song, ""Christmas Time is Here Again"", even adding bagpipes. The bagpipes also add a nice touch to ""Little Drummer Boy"", and Ringo's version is better than most for this song. Another the highlight is the steel-drum, tropical-sounding ""White Christmas"". The Christmas standards like ""Winter Wonderland"" and ""Rudolph"" are done in the fun-loving style that you might expect from Ringo."
5,The Best of all the World,"Ringo was always my very favorite since I was 8-years-old. I have the same common with Ringo. I'm the oldest of the class of 2005, and he's the oldest of the band. We are good with kids, we both have the same pierce on our left ear, our parents got a divorce, song lyrics, and we both love Christmas. I first heard his album last year's Christmas. It belongs to my dad, but I can listen to it whenever I want during Christmas. It's my favorite holiday. I first saw Ringo's concert on May 28, 2000. When I was the only one in the audience jumping, and waving at him, Ringo pointed at me as he noticed me. I felt like I was gonna die and go to heaven. I'll always wish Ringo a Merry Christmas. :)"
3,Ok storage,"Purchased this to hope for a solution to storing the lids to some of my pots and pans. It does the job, just is a bit flimsy. You cannot overload this shelf. Very easy to install with only a couple of screws to use to screw to the bottom of your cabinet. It does not slide as freely as I had hoped, but then again it is plastic and there are no metal rollers to help it slide."
4,Seemed like it would work well...,I returned this lid rack after discovering that it was too deep for my old school custom cabinets. Seemed like it would work good though for normal depth cabinets. Make sure you verify the depth before you buy!
1,Very Disappointing,"This looks simple & convenient but it was a nightmare to install & it still doesn't work properly. The instructions are vague & installing the unit in a bottom cupboard took almost an hour (installing in an upper cabinet makes the contents hard to see & retrieve). For us, the unit's capacity (4 lids) and the shipping cost (about 50% of the price) made this purchase a waste of time & money."
4,Pot lid storage,"Before I bought this product, I measured my cabinet interior. The measurements indicated that the product would fit. It was easy to install and is just as pictured in my base cabinet so I can organize my pot lids and have space for my pots."
2,Suede?,"These are adorable very flat shoes. I've actually felt more support in a pair of slippers. Absolutely no foot support! I also don't feel the need for heavy metal discs-which is an embellishment that is going to add to the cost...but they are attached in such a way that they will not endure regular useAnd if you're expecting suede, better try something else."
4,"Pretty pink watch, though the strap is quite thick","The watch is much as I had imagined it would look, the strap is quite thick though, which I didn't mind but wasn't expecting."
2,Restlessness vs Tediousness,"In my opinion of ""Travels with Charley,"" Steinbecks depicts a society in a search of something. I like the way he describes that hunger for travel,"" ...not toward something but away from something (P10),"" which is true not only for Americans but also for most people in the planet. Nevertheless, I did not find the book appealing or interesting enough. It was not one of those books that you cannot put down. His sophisticated writing styles made it difficult to follow for ESL students and for non-native speakers."
3,Trying too hard...,"...It seems as if Frente! thought that they may not have been taken seriously enough after their charming but breezy Marvin the Album, so they needed to make a point here.The seemingly obvious result of this need to be serious is the dirge-like opening cut, ""Sit on my Hands."" ""Sit on my Hands"" is a dark and plodding tome that robs the listener of any of the cheery expecations they might have had going in.The album brightens up considerably later, but never hits the same easy stride that Marvin did.Perhaps this is a classic sophomore slump, but it is also possible that Marvin was just a lucky of convergence of wit and whimsy that is unlikely to be repeated."
2,lame single,"I don't know why this song is good. I find this song the lamest of all singles released from Confessions. Her Jump video sucked too. Madonna, you're almost 50 now. You shouldn't dye your hair bleached blond from the Express Yourself & Vogue days. And you shouldn't dress like a skater/street punk. God Madonna you are such a poser. What's next the surfer girl beach girl look. If that's you're next image reinvention you better know how to surf. I can't forget that fact that you were trying to be all cowgirl in your Music album. Did u grew up in the country or were you raised in the midwest. No. So why were you trying to be all cowgirl. One of the singers of the girl group Seduction from the late 80's was right about you your such a poser."
3,Some things should be left alone.,I gave this single 3 stars because its only redeemed by the extended version of Jump and the track History which admittedly is'nt great but not horrible. Apparently there is single mix of History I've never heard and should have been included on this single instead of the very forgettable remixes of Jump. None of the remixes add anything to the already perfectly produced original version. The remixes take the joy and the good beat out of the original.
3,can't beat the original mix,i bought this single as i like the song and thought the remixes would be good but the original album mix is the best i'm a fan of remixes but this singles remixes were a disapointment
4,"It's better than ""get together""","This CD single is 10x better than the ""get together"" one. History is awesome, the extended album version is awesome, the Jacques Lu Cont mix is the bomb. Do a bump, put the i-pod in the ears and go outside and listen...... Isn't that the point of re-mixing?"
2,let down.,"What an amazing song, and it is my favorite on the album.I was really looking forward to the cd single being released, and waited around 2 months for it to finally come out.When it did come out in Australia, it only contained the radio edit, junior sanchez mix and new song history.Looks as though we only got Jump part 2 here in Australia.I was very disappointed that the other remixes were not included, and I did not like the junoir sanchez mix at all.I was really looking forward to hearing the Jaques Lu cont mix, as I have enjoyed his past work for Madonna, and also the extended album version.Unfortunately neither were included on the cd single in Australia."
3,"Good, but...","...not up to Madonna in her prime. Its hard for anyone to sound good in the tinny world of current dance music. Between its over engineered treble and its over burden of bass, the music gets lost somewhere.In this CD, Madonna does the best that she can with the material provided. What comes out is a CD from talented artist of non-memorable music that serves less of proof of her real artistry as it does confirmation that no one can work it like she can.I would only recommend this for hardcore Madonna fans."
2,Better to buy to Confessions Live CD/DVD collection instead,"I thought this ""Jump"" compilation would be a good workout CD, however, only the first and last song is really worth listening to. I like the song ""Jump,"" but you're better off just buying the Live Confessions Tour CD or CD/DVD collection instead. They are way better! Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Average Mixes,"Although I had to have this cd in my collection, it's a bit of a disappointment. The only good thing is the extended album version, the reason why it bought it in the first place. I heard better remixes by Axwell before, the same can be said about Sanchez. Too bad that [Paul Oakenfold] didn't remix this song. I liked his version of ""Sorry"" a lot and was hoping the same here. Or an [Above & Beyond Remix] like ""Nobody Knows Me"", those are both real good dance trax. Let's hope with the next single, Madonna comes to her senses and picks other people to mix the tracks."
3,JUMP (if u feel like...),"I bought this maxi, 'cause ""Jump"" was in my opinion one of the best tracks on ""COADF"" cd. Am I disappointed? No.Am I on a cloud ? Neither. There are 6 tracks on it, and 4 of them I find good.The two I find not so cool are Axwell and Sanchez's mixes.If you are her fan, buy it. Otherwise, you can skip maxi and buy some of the mixes apart on Itunes."
2,GET READY TO JUMP!,"having collected all the authorized maxi-singles of her madjesty madonna, this is one disappointment. while the song is great, the remixes are not so much. interestingly, i only liked the short and long versions of the songand the one remixed by stuart price - it has different refrain! not even the unreleased track, ""history"" could make up for this mess.buy instead the spectacular album ""confessions on a dance floor"" and avoid disappointment...whatever happened to madonna's great remixes in the 80's and 90's? call shep pettibone! junior vasquez! william orbit! etc...still, long live the queen!"
2,"Awesome packaging, terrible sound","I was so excited when I got these earphones - they look great, they seem really well made, they are beautifully presented in their box and come with some awesome accessories like the carry case. Then I put them on, plugged them into my ipod and.... no bass. And I'm not exactly a base-fiend, I don't turn up the volume all the way or anything. But I expect to be able to hear drums and bass guitars. It's like they're completely hollow. I am going back to my $8 Sony earphones."
5,"Great headphone, good price",You get a lot for 30 $. The sound is great and they have excellent isolation. One down side is that my ears are a weird shape so they don't fir PERFECTLY. Most of my friends who have tried them love their fit and sound.
2,Very dissapointing sound,"After doing some extensive browsing, reading reviews here and elsewhere, and having had many high quality products from JBL all my life, I decided on these headphones to replace my current iPod ones with a superior quality than the average $5 headphones, yet the sound quality is absolutely terrible, very dissapointing given that JBL has a reputation for high volume, high quality sound, perhaps not audiophile level, but definitely always above average. The bass is simply not existent, overall the sound is distorted with an iPod or even to a CD player. I gave this product 2 stars because the fit, look and finish is really great, but the sound was truly awful. I ended up getting much better sound from a set of Philips headphones I found at $10 at my local Walgreen's. Hopefully my next JBL product will restore my faith in the brand."
2,disappointed,"The ear buds were comfortable and the sound fair. And, it worked nicely for about 4 or 5 months before one of the wires connecting to the earbub crackled, sputtered, and broke. I didn't abuse it all all. Just writing to warn others. I now ordered the klipsch and hopefully these will last longer and sound alot better."
4,JBL Reference 220 Review,"These headphones are pretty good quality. Their best feature is the unique nylon wire. They sell for $82 in stores and i picked them up from amazon for the excellent price of $30. The box was sealed and they are brand new, but there are a few accessories missing. you don't really need them so its not very important. This was a great buy!"
1,Lasted two charge cycles,"So, on the positive side, the beam is nice and bright, and I like the two handles. However, this item has a short lifespan.The first time I charged it, I used the car charger, and it charged nicely and the battery lasted a reasonably long time (considering the light output of the thing).The second time I charged it, the car charger would no longer work at all, and I had to plug it into a wall outlet. This worked, though, and the spotlight again worked well.The third time I tried to charge it, the wall plug is no longer working either. It's not imparting any charge at all, even though the little red/green LEDs make it seem like it's trying to charge.These halogen spotlights seem to be generally low quality across the board, but I'd still expect it to last more than 2 charge cycles. Don't buy."
1,"Wow, Absolute Crap!!!","I thought I was the only person with this problem, but apparently not!I got mine while it was still Vector (Now B&D;) and it did the same thing. I thought that since Vector was taken over by B&D;, they may have improved this spotlight. Apparently not!I got mine about 3 years ago, and I went through the same process as everyone else. All in all, I got about 5 hours of use out of it. It doesn't charge anymore, and I don't know how to get a new battery, and since I really hate returning things (just so much hassle), I took it as a loss.It's a huge, sturdy, great-looking paperweight now.Unbelievable. I can't believe they're still selling these like this!!!"
1,"DOA - Dead on Arrival, Won't Hold a Charge","Couldn't get it to charge. I followed the directions for 1st time charge, letting the unit charge for 24 hours, and only the two red lights were on. I then charged an extra 6 hours to the maximum (as stated in the instructions) of 30 hours. All three lights (the two red & the green) were on, but the green light never blinked to show that the unit was charged. Tried to use it - no go. Am returning this spotlight and will get another brand / model. Unfortunate, as I really like my other Black & Decker products - and I own quite a few."
2,Spotlight for Professionals,This is very heavy and has a very short light life. Not good for home use.
1,Short on power,"This light worked great but only lasted about 10 minutes. Recharged it and again, only lasted about 10 minutes. Noticed that the date code was 1.5 years old. Returned and bought another one with a newer date code. This one lasted 20 minutes. Called B&D but they could not explain the short lighting time."
3,spotlight,"This item is probably one of the best of the high-intensity spotlights available. That being said, you should be aware that all of these types of lights have a very short battery life; expect a maximum of about 15 minutes of use. We use them for looking into dark manholes on cloudy days. On a sunny day, a mirror works about as well."
1,"5 minutes of light, maybe, on a full charge","Black & Decker was once a proud American company whose products were always solid, and whose name you could rely on. This product is so grossly defective, and B&D's support so irresponsible, that it is obviously no longer the same company, except in name."
1,Buyer Beware,"If you haven't read enough bad reviews for this product to convince you not to buy it, here is one more. I used this sparingly and by the 4th time after fully charging it, it did not last long enough to make it across the room. Tried charging it for 24 hours again and same thing, probably lasted 15 seconds, not exaggerating. Wish I would have used it more within the 30 days return policy to realize there was an issue. Now I will also have to pay to have this properly e-recycled."
1,worthless,"I see some reviews that say run it all the way down before re-charging...that's NOT a problem, if our power goes out and I am dumb enough to grab this thing I MIGHT make it to the bath-room before it goes out, coming back you use your furniture finders (shins) I love Black and Decker but they need to watch who uses there name."
1,"As other noted, it is junk",I only charged and used it 3 or 4 times. It just went completely dead after a few months. Stay away.
1,A 'P.O.S.' - get another brand.,Mine suffered intermittent trouble. After a couple years of never knowing if it will work or not I decided to open it up and see what I can find. The first thing I discovered is the blade connector to the positive battery terminal was lose. This explains why it finally quit working. Then I discovered the blade connector to the negative terminal did not fit tightly and was only holding on by the tension of the wire. This could explain the intermittent trouble also. By now the battery is ruined from 'abuse' and while not impossible to find a replacement it is not economically practical to replace.
1,Junk,"I've owned this for more than a year. Like other say, it's scary how B&D could actually sell this complete garbage. The first use was excellent. But, unfortunately, there was only one use. Charging it for its second use, it wouldn't hold a charge and was absolutely useless. After returning it for a replacement, I experienced the exact same behavior. I won't purchase any B&D product."
2,Not one of fripp's best sounscapes,"Owning most of Robert Fripp's Soundscapes CD's, I think this is the least recommendable. Most of the time it is pretty unmelodic and kind of disturbing in some passages. On the contrary, his cd called ""A Blessing of tears"" is a beautiful, soothing soundscape, made with electric guitar and a load of loops and effects. Finally, the cd called "" That wich Passes"" is half and half of both styles. Definetly i'd go for "" A Blessing"" to begin with."
2,Disappointed,The book is large and beautiful but mostly contains pictures of various models used by Chanel. There wasn't any photos of Chanel. Not what I expected.
4,Captivating,This book is loaded with photos as well as personal and professional information. I devoured the book when I got it and could review it on a daily basis --it's so fun! And pretty!
5,A marketing triumph about marketing!,"Chanel is one of the world's most recognized brands, particularly within the luxury arena. I found this volume gorgeous from its presentation to its textual consideration of a very important brilliant individual behind-the-scenes. I highly recommend this volume."
1,Waste of their talent and my time,"These are pretty good actors trying to make the best of unsympathetic characters and a wandering story line, but they cannot pull it off. The director has them drifting through a hallucinatory story line in the apparent belief that, if no one can actually understand what is going on whenever Genevieve Bujold pops up looking like bag-lady and spouting some nonsense, they will assume the story has Deep Meaning. Throw in some hopelessly incompetent protagonists who are pretty much just murdering thieves and the hopefully unintended stereotyping of every ethnic character who appears. Then top it off with a villain who looks, dresses and acts like Ben Stiller in an Oscar Show send-up and you can understand why all the whiskey was gone by the end of the movie. The cast and crew drank it when they realized what this project might do to their careers."
1,Where to begin?,"I suffered through this mystic-backwoods mess so that you don't have to! Kris Kristofferson says in the ""making of"" feature (which was better than the movie itself!) that he wasn't sure if Genevieve Bujold's character was real or not. This does not bode well for me or you knowing, either. There are large objects that disappear as well, and a bad guy that refuses to die. Enjoy!"
5,Tasty!,A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper. I just wish they were bigger bags :)
5,Such an excellent chip,"My aunt gave me a bag of these and I was immediately addicted. There are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. I love the zip, agreed they are awesome without salsa, and no trans fat!"
2,Meh,"I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate. I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks. But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all. Practically bland, in fact. Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case. Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12."
1,"The ""Organic"" Label is Misleading","""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities."
3,Kind of Bland,"These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again."
4,Broken chips but tasty,I love these chips and ordered them after I had some in Florida. My case of chips came without any packing inside. All bags in a box with no cushioning at all. Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again. A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.
2,"Not, my favorite chip","I did not like these potatoe chips. It's hot, and sweet, with an overwhelming taste of garlic. It's also a bit salty."
4,Very different flavor,"I love these chips. The flavor is not plain. They are sweet and spicy all at the same time. The only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. But, it still a great flavor!"
5,These are the best widely available bbq chips!,"thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips."
1,Hawaii Five-O -TheComplete Seventh Season,"Quality certainly not as good as the first 5 seasons. Surprisingly the quality of the first 5 seasons is almost blue-ray quality. Don't know the reason, it is almost as if the box gets smaller the quality goes down."
1,Garage sale merchandise at full retail prices,My wife and I love Hawaii Five-0. We have bought and returned season 7 because when it comes the packaging is damaged and the disks don't work. It looks like something hit the package so hard that the tangs that hold the DVDs in place have broken. So the disks are free to bounce around. Some of the DVDs work and others are so badly damaged that they do not.I am giving up on Amazon for this purchase and will look elsewhere.My negative review has nothing to do with the content of Hawaii Five-0. That is great. We are just frustrated with getting garage sale quality merchandise at full retail prices.
3,"A Little More Uneven than Usual, but Still Great Fun!","This seventh season of the long-running hit cop show has all the action and beautiful scenery of the first five, but the scripts are more uneven and a few stretch credulity a bit too far. As usual, some of the acting is a little stiff, but in this show the realism of authentic local people adds to the charm. In spite of two or three (relative) stinkers, several episodes in this set rank among the best ever."
5,Off the rictah scale,"I must admit this album is tight. I love the song ""Imagine That"", and ""How You Living"". This album is great"
4,This Cd is Way better than there first one!,"There first cd wasn't all that good to me, it actually derseved a 2 on th 1-10 scale. this cd is a big leap in the right direction. the beats are cool and the lyrics are awesome. my favorite tracks are ""There He is"", ""My Body"", ""put your hands"", and ""Spiritual love"" which is actually a love song about a relationship with a man, except a christian relationship! I love this cd and recommend this for everyone. I love playingit in my room when I'm not even there. This Cd is realy good and I hope you enjoy i as much as i do! This is a 6 on the 1-10 scale!"
5,MY PEOPLE DOING GREAT THINGS.,ANGEL IS MY COUSIN'S SISTER ON HIS DADDY'S SIDE.I MET HER ONCE AT THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE IN PRESS PARK AFTER HIS MOTHER'S FUNERAL.SHE TOLD US HER GROUP WAS ABOUT TO BE SIGNED.
5,"Irresistible, Uplifting","If you love these young ladies first album .. I highly suggest you picking this up they continue to spread their very powerful messages in a way to reach all ages combining secular music( r n b, Hip-Hop) with traditional gospel.. If you like good gospel music add this to your collectionFav. TracksSpirtual LoveThere He IsHow You LivingThe Day You Came"
4,"Great follow-up, but not the same vibe without Terri!","I like this CD alot. In fact, I was mad excited when it came out. My favorite song is ""The Day You Came"" because it reminds me of when I came to Christ. The girls have really matured alot vocally, and Adrian has a nice voice, but only in the background.As a matter of fact, it reminded me of Destiny's Child. It's just not the same without Terri. I don't understand how Terri could have ruined their image by being married and having a child. That's just not fair, and everyone, including Adrian, suffers for that. Adrian is trying to replace someone else that left (or was dismissed) abruptly, and the other two girls seem to just want things their way.Oh well, I'll still hope for the best for them."
2,Not as good as they said it would be,"The ""learning"" part of this remote is stupid. It has never given me back the full function of my vcr like the original remote did. It works, but not fully..."
5,Give these guys a grammy,"Well what can I say about this album? It is hand down THE best album I have ever owned. I first saw these guys live at The Brink in Tulsa, OK and was blown away. I bought Wonderworld the minute it was released in October 1999. I still listen to it to this day almost five years later and have never grown tired of it. I was shocked to say to least when I learned that these guys broke up. To know the world will never get a taste of more Mollys Yes is truly an injustice. You must buy this album."
1,What A Bunch of Crap,"From the previous reviews, this CD sounded like it was going to be great. I buy it. Boy, am I disapointed. What a bunch of crap! This is the most contrived, unmelodic, earnest bands trying to be late-80's U2 in the late 90's I have ever heard! BEWARE: before you buy, listen to the sound samples on here and ask yourself if you really need this flakiness in your life."
2,Not Very Good,"The Mollys arena friendly alternative missed mass acceptance by just a hair, they're bland enough, to be sure, but not big enough. Recommended for fans of Goo Goo Dolls, Foo Fighters and other faceless `alternative' bands. Sounds Ok at first brush but is instantly forgettable, and not worth a closer look"
1,Is this a contemporary christian disc in disguise?,"I have listened to this cd about 12 times now and I have to say, it's 11 times too many. These guys sound a lot like a contemporary christian band. The failed attempts to emulate some kind of neo 80's U2 meets comercial Peter Gabrial meets Backstreet Boys puffed up by ego induced spirituality are very sad. The only real shining moment is the VERY pop song Sugar. I hope these guys are prepared to be compared to a host of 80's bands because that is exactly what they sound like. It reminds me of a number of bands in the midwest that have spent years playing covers of U2 and Peter Gabrial songs in the name of art. The singer has a good voice but the guitars sound like keyboards and the drums sound like a drum machine, such a shame. Can't recomend this one. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong."
2,"Big name, mediocre product","Another reviewer summed it up nicely: ""The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike."" Additionally, the company itself is not customer friendly. Don't expect much help if there's a problem with the order or delivery."
4,Heavenly Chocolates,The order came in a timely fashion & in its own cooler with dry ice.My wife loves dark chocolate & is more or less a connoisseur. She gave it her highest praise.
3,Decent garbage for the price,"How much can one write about a <$10 plastic garbage can? It does what it's supposed to moderately well. The lid doesn't stay on great and the swinging lid doesn't always swing smoothy. For less than ten bucks, I didn't expect much more."
4,Love this trash can!,"I purchased this trash can for my white bathroom, and its perfect. It stays hidden in a corner, and is functional. I bought a similar one in light brown for a different bathroom and loved it so much that when I added a bathroom to my apartment, I had to have a similar one, I was happy to find this in white. Its perfect for the bathroom."
2,LIMITED UTILITY with HIGH PRICE,"Size, design, and price are negatives; otherwise okay. The size would be appropriate for a kid's play house or maybe a kid's room. The design of the lid has two flaws: the lid does not fit snugly on the base and the swing top does not swing freely and rarely returns to close on its own. A couple of inches added to the diameter and several inches in height would make this trash can about right for an adult bathroom or a kitchen. I bought a slightly smaller one at a Dollar Tree store (yes, for one $) and somehow the manufacturer had figured out how to make the top fit snugly, design the swing top to return to neutral consistently and, appropriate for its size, render it in kids' (McD) colors. I also saw two other of ""our"" Umbras (in blue and black) at a thrift store each for 99cents. Both of these suffered the same design defects as the one we purchased on Amazon."
4,Hasbro beary tales,"I am very happy with this book it has arrived pretty soon, in perfect conditions, very well packaged, and is a very nice story."
5,One Soldiers Dream...,"The Road Back, sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front, is a incredibly touching story of comrades returning from years at war to a society that neither wants to accept nor help them in their search for a meaningful life after war. This lost generation goes through life seeing no more purpose in living.Remarque's incredible descriptive style leads the reader through turmoil in Germany, from food shortages, to political unrest, suicide, and murder, and yet at the same time he makes pauses to simply show some of the beauty left in the world. The characters are incredible and after putting down the book I felt that I had bonded with people I had only known for a couple of hundred pages and yet had been through so much with. Follow the comrades through tough times and their realizations about their own meanings of life."
5,"Even better than ""All Quiet""","I read this book for a course on Inter-war Europe and I absolutely devoured this book. Admittedly, you need to have a basic grasp on German history during the first few years after World War I, but I think that this would be a useful book for creating a better understanding of those who return home from war. As much as ""All Quiet"" was great for it's strong anti-war messages, ""The Road Back"" really hits home because it is about life after and away from war. It is about families and friendship and estrangement. It is a book about life. And life, in the confines of this book, is excruciatingly beautiful. Well worth a read."
5,surreal and hypnotic,"I loved this book so much I've been carrying it around with me for 30 years. It has a unique plot the like of which I have never seen elsewhere. At a superficial level it is a story of how a young woman's life is affected by a ghost from the past, but it is at root a novel of obsession and compulsion. It has a dream - like quality and maybe is better interpreted than read. It is also well - written and well -paced.I looked up this book to see what else the author wrote. There is one novel listed before this one, and none since. I wish I knew what happened to the woman who wrote this; who herself had such a unique voice."
3,Family tradition,I was so happy to find this book. It is a family tradition that each member in our family has read it. I wanted it for the new generations who was looking forward to reading it. The book arrived promptly and in fairly good condition.
5,The Best I've Read,"I'm a deeply committed appreciator of dog companionship. I've read a lot of dog training books, and this is the best I've come across. John Ross helps the owner understand what it means to be the the dog's pack leader. He respects a dog's basic nature and helps owners understand that nature better."
5,Excellent,"An excellent book which advocates a refreshing change of approach. Barry, my 12 year old spaniel, viewed my attempt to ""sniff-bond"" with him with bemused indifference, though I would not suggest a shopping mall as a place to initiate this form of relationship building."
4,Informative and helpful,"We bought this book with two others and it was one that we referred to often. In our house we referred to the author as ""The Arrogant One"" as in ""The Arrogant One says..."" But putting that aside, it was well written and gives great descriptions and instructions. After going about raising our dog this way (and buying three or more books was the suggestion of the Monks from New Skete who raise German Shepherds), we are convinced that folks like John Ross and Barbara McKinney are essential in helping new pet owners make informed decisions. They really helped us gain a good perspective for raising our dog. Highly suggest this book."
3,Not the best book out there...,"I've been reading book after book on dog behavior, trainging, etc. in preparation for my new puppy. Of all the books I've read this is my least favorite. I feel like the tone of the book is a over-simplified while other great books like ""The Other End of the Leash"" and ""Good Owners, Great Dogs"" respect the intelligence of their reader. I also think that using the book recommended ""NHAA"" over a simple ""No"" is silly. Anyway, this book is alright, but there are MUCH better out there. Try the two listed above as well as ""Positive Perspectives; Love your dog, Train your dog"" by Pat Miller and ""The Art of Raising a Puppy"" by the Monks of New Skete."
1,IT HURTS. MAKE IT STOP MOMMY!,"A plane's engine is on fire. The pilot opts to cut off the fuel in flight to stop the fire, however the engine doesn't restart and the plane crashes. The operator was blamed for ""human error"" even though the black box (never mentioned) would have exonerated the pilot. Brad Dourif plays the evil capitalist wanting to exploit the accident to promote his new CD-70 automatic pilot, based on predator drone technology. Casper Van Dien is not too sure about using the M-5 eh ah CD-70. Lets see...if I was to guess they use the CD-70, it messes up and Casper must save the day by killing giant alien bugs. And the reason why I am guessing is that it became too painful to watch the film all the way through. It was bad...real bad, as in destroy your copy, don't give it away bad.The acting and script felt like a bad movie made for TV circa 1975. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Turbulent Skies,This was an ok movie. Another airplane disaster movie like all the other disaster movies. Only gave it two stars.
2,"Ok, i'll admit it's lame","I typically like Casper Van Dien's low budget stuff, but i have to admit this felt a little under cooked.Computerized plane goes out of control, passengers freak out, Casper comes to the rescue, and it's all settled in lightning speed. If i had to pinpoint a problem, it's a lack of real tension. The plot is just a little too simplistic to serve as a compelling action-adventure vehicle. Still, it's not his worst film."
1,Don't parents know how explicit this song is?,"What is ""Liquid Dreams"" supposed to imply anyway? Hmmmmm..."
1,Not Stainless Steel,"This set is not surgical stainless steel construction, it is nickel plated, according to Wusthof's catalog. It is still a decent product, but not what it claimed to be in the description."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this item and returned it. The cuticle scissors didn't work well and were poor quality in my opinion. The ""nail clipper"" was not a conventional nail clipper, and I found it awkward to use.Save your dough. Buy something else."
4,A very good book with a cumbersome introduction,"Prof. Clark's study of the Origenist controversy has quickly established itself as essential reading. Her broad knowledge of the times makes it an excellent orientation for anyone who wants to learn about these debates. That being said, it remains the case that the first segment of the book is a largely worthless application of social network analysis to the discussion. These pages tell the reader more about Clark's sophisticated understanding of contemporary theory than about the feud over 'the dispersal of the effects of Origen' (to paraphrase Christopher Stead). Nevertheless, the book is recommended as an extremely comprehensive overview of this important controversy."
2,Amateurish,"Foolish me - I trusted the online reviews and bought this book. Mildly interesting plot, but it was marred by painful spelling errors that give the reader the impression that the only proofreader was a spell-check program. (""Reign"" instead of ""rain,"" ""now"" instead of ""know,"" etc.)Still, it held my interest even though none of the characters was well fleshed-out."
4,Helpful book,This is a helpful book that I enjoy reading and that I need to review often to keep my mind focused on things that will help me achieve my desired weight goal.
5,Excellent for the new photographer!,I am new to photography and I want to make money. This book is filled with a wealth of information. I highly recommend it!
5,"Great style, great information!","If all you want to do is make money -- lots of it -- from your photography, this book will help you a great deal. After all, there's more to photography than artsy stuff. Many photographers take photos for a living, and stock photography is one way to do that. Those who think they can sell landscapes, birds, scenics, and wildflowers probably woouldn't buy this book in any case. The rest of us, who want to make a decent living, can learn some valuable lessons herein. By the way, making money with your camera can lead to a great deal of joy and pleasure."
1,Quite disappointing.,"In a nutshell, the only advice this author gives is to take pictures that evoke an emotion in the viewer and send it off to every company that may want it. It does include a couple of forms, most of which are available through sites like PDN Online at no charge..."
2,This Edition Is Really Outdated,"So much has changed in the photography world since this was written and updated in 1997. Advice how how to submit slides and why not to buy a Mac (because hardly anyone has them) seems very odd these days. Also the formulas for creating ""great stock pictures"" have become outdated as well. I have no doubt this would have been a great and informative book in the 80's or 90's but because of the rapid changes in digital technology this book is kind of like reading a ""How to Operate Your BetaMax"" manual. Perhaps the newer versions would be money better spent."
4,"Useful, Interesting and Surpising","I found this book to be a wealth of information on what information tracks people, is public, or provided to anyone for a minimal fee. I was especially surpised to find information about MYSELF...which is why I bought 'Hide your assets and disappear'. I agree with another review that states that the book is interesting and helps explain how people are traced..but fails to instruct exactly HOW it is you should go about it. I would have liked to have seen a more precise, instructional book...but I still recommend this as a great read. Using the book's advice and the internet I've come across lots of information that has proved useful. It's a small investment with a big pay-off in knowledge. Perhaps he'll write a follow-up where he goes into more detail. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK and enjoyed it."
2,Miserable,This book is very difficult to follow. The format makes learning the material extremely difficult and the few examples they give are not very helpful. It is a great struggle to try and grasp the relatively easy concepts the way this book presents these concepts.
2,Misleading Marketing - Doesn't protect against UVA,"Ah, Neutrogena triple protect! Self proclaiming to guard the skin via soothing razor irritation, healing dry skin, and helping to fight the signs of aging with its SPF 20 sunscreen protection. That's all fine and dandy until you flip the bottle over only to read the fine print on the reverse side where it is revealed that (emphasis mine):""This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT SKIN CANCER OR EARLY SKIN AGING""Reading between the lines, this implies that it only affords protection against UVB rays. Disappointing in that this lotion really does a great job in the after-shave uses that it is touted for. Unfortunately, in the end, its an expensive product that underwhelms in the skin protection department."
3,Not for me,"Perhaps, this is the best of the department store face lotions for men. I've tried a number of them and ended up using this brand for a while (after applying Nivea Extra Sensitive Shaving Balm to soothe any irritation). However, I think it has some type of alcohol or other drying agent in the product, because there is a subtle burn when I apply it to shaven areas. I also find this lotion somewhat thick. Recently, I began using American Crew's after shave facial moisturizer. I much prefer this product. Its light, smells great, and makes my skin feel really healthy. Plus, I don't have to use the Nivea balm, and it's about the same price as this relatively small tube of Neutrogena lotion."
1,Did not work for me,"I used this lotion and immediately developed rashes on my face. I didn't suspect this caused it, and went to see the dermatologist who gave me something to fix those.It took me a couple of weeks to clear out my skin, and I started using this again. Within 2 days I developed even a worse rash than before. This time I figured it was this lotion.Then I actually looked at the back of the lotion, and noticed a warning. ""Stop using if a rash develops"". I had no idea that using a lotion can cause such a bad rash. May be that's a standard warning on other lotions too, but I've never noticed it before. I didn't even think that's possible, but then my dermatologist said that it's probably the ""anti aging"" part of it that caused it.Anyway, just a warning for someone who might be trying it out for the first time."
2,Where is the State Version?,"I don't have any particular problems with the federal version. I don't necessarily think that it is better or worse than Turbo Tax, which is the software that I usually use and will probably be using next year. But my question is this: Its Feb. 12, where is the state version? The PC version is out, why does it take so long to get the Mac version? I got an email saying that the State Mac Version for Virginia was available to download, only to go to their web site and find that it wasn't available except for ordering.I think this will be the first and last year I use TurboTax."
3,Mac OS 9.2 or better required,The system requirements for the 2003 premium version I received says it requires Mac OS 9.2 or greater and the installer does not recognize OS 8.x.
4,Made the switch from TurboTax.,"I switched from TurboTax last year. The main reason being the issues with spyware in the PC version of that program. I also didn't like all of the hoops they were trying to make their customers jump through. Or the fact that they charge a 25% higher premium price for the Mac version of their software.Using TaxCut for the first time was a decent experience. The program itself is easy to use and negotiate. Jumping back and forth in the return was a fairly simple process. The downside, most of the FAQ pages seemed to go nowhere.I was able to quickly import my tax info from the previous year's TurboTax files without any problem. The user interface is easily understandable. Overall, TaxCut seems to be a step or two behind TurboTax. But the end results are the same, a tax refund which more than pays for the program. And those steps behind are small steps."
1,Non-intuitive interface and functionality,"I found this software very strange. I have used TurboTax online in the past and things have been a breeze. My taxes changed signifigantly this year so I decided to buy Taxcut because it doesn't have Spyware. Taxcut would have skipped quite a few deductions had I not known that I could take certain deductions - I kind of had to force myself into the forms and override certain things. Also, I did my roomates' taxes and it skipped over a $3000 education deduction that she was entitled too. I don't really care for the interview style of filing - answering a series of questions and it files your taxes according to your answers - because it missed several deductions I was entitled to. All in all, I'm very dissappointed and won't be using this software again."
1,Forget any support for Mac users!!,"Bought this program, as I have for several years, to do my taxes early. TaxCut always wishes for you to do an ""update"" on their software before using it. When I tried to update, I got a message that the update would not be available until mid February. When I wrote support and complained and ask about it, they said not to expect an update for the Mac until the end of February. Then, I was told later, they didn't know when it would be updated. What good is it if I can't do my taxes with it when I purchase it? The Windoz version is already complete according to their site. Save yourself the hassle and get another program for the Mac to do your taxes this year!!"
4,Switched from TurboTax,"This year I switched from the windoZe TurboTax. I thought I'd try the Mac version, but didn't want to pay the Turbo-(Macintosh)""tax"" (+$10 for Mac users) so am trying TaxCut. So far so good. TaxCut imported the (windoZe) TurboTax data fine and all the previous year's data shows up nicely. It has a nice summary task/forms list that shows you which data/forms are (which are done, which are in progress etc). I tend to use that rather than the interview process since I get various data/statements at different times and just jump around as I get to them rather than have all my statements ready for an ""interview"". Unfortuately it doesn't look like you can buy the State version from Amazon (or other store), so I'll probably have to buy/download it from the TaxCut website."
2,Warning for Mac Users,"This is a very easy program to use, but my filing has been held up because they have not updated one of the forms necessary for real estate income. They said it would be ready in mid-February, but now customer support says they do not know when it will be ready for the Mac. I don't know how many other forms they are missing, so Turbotax may be a better buy even though it is overpriced for the Mac."
2,Not worth reading,"I found that this book did not give very much usable advice. Also, the author kept referring to something called the Compass system, but never explained it in the book."
4,A Very Special Christmas CD,"It is nice to have some more modern, hip Christmas music. Sometimes the old songs feel a little stale and some new energy is just what we enjoyed with this CD this year. There are a lot of good songs on this Cd. Of course it is hard to love them all, because tastes must vary too much.However I would recommend anyway."
1,Want to REALLY rock around the CHristmas tree??,"I'm sorry but unless you have no belief in the real meaning of Christmas, this CD is just a bunch of secular rock artists supporting a great cause (Special Olympics) but I doubt that one of them actually believe why we even have Christmas.All these arrangements would work just fine in a smoke filled, alcohol bemuddled bar.I erased most from my hard drive after copying then gave the CD away.If you don't believe in Christmas - buy it - you will probably like it."
4,Not exactly what I expected,"I was hoping for a completely pictorial work, but am not displeased with the commentary provided. A great book, but I was underwhelmed with the amount of photographs, I just expected more, even with prose added in between."
2,Cute but...,"I was somewhat dissapointed by this book. I absolutely loved the illustrations but there should a lot more to a children's art book than hip illustrations to please the parents with 'artsy' definitions like cubism, Braque, Dali - I challenge anyone to try to explain these concepts to a toddler using this book... To sum it up: the book seemed 'undercooked' to me, the text was not up to par with the illustrations - there are better children's 'art' book on the market."
3,not a whole lot of content,"This book showcases the styles of a few prominent artists/art schools, with the added cute factor of puns: for example, Van Gogh's page shows a classic VW bus at a green light, redone a la ""Starry Night."" I know it's a board book for infants and toddlers and is by necessity short, but this one seems especially so. Inclusion of a few more pages would be awfully nice. My kiddos got bored with this after 3-4 readings over a fortnight. Now they bypass it on the bookshelf and even refuse it from among my bedtime story selections."
1,"Cheap, but horrible condition","Spine of the book was broken, pages fell out easily. Cover was not in great shape, and pages are very very old."
2,"Yeah, yeah, A sense of SELF","I read this because It was listed as a ""great book"". Why, I don't know. Maybe at the time it was risque. Imagine the horror! A wife, not happy with just being a wife! Soon she begins to realize that she is an indvidual who has her own sexual desires, so she trapses around town with men while her husband is away on business. It was a labor to read this, but I always finish. You however- I would not reccomend picking this up."
2,backup alarm,"the alarm goes off in direct sunlight . We have lot of sunlight in Las Vegas, so the thing is beeping all the time."
3,Good for a limited time,"Received this product and installed fully on my mothers '08 Impala within 10 mins. It doesn't take much, just clean the lens over the break light.It's small and would likely cover some of the smaller reverse light lenses.I installed it and it functioned for about three weeks. I assume its a a dead battery. I haven't taken it apart to check to see why its not functioning.I will update this review when I figure out whats up."
1,Fail to make noise,This is supposed to do one thing and one thing only. Make noise when the reverse lights come on. Mine didn't. It didn't make noise ever. Tried shining a flashlight at it and it still didn't work.Waste of my money.
4,Back Up Alarm,"Works great when backing up, but it is also triggered by the sun when parked or driving with the sun from the rear."
2,"Interesting, but not practical","At first it works while you back up. But there are issues:1. If the Sun is shining behind your car's back, the back-up light will reflect the light into the alarm and it will beep forever.2. It runs on battery so it runs out of juice quickly.I would go with a special light bulb which has an alarm built-in. Amazon has one but I don't know if it fits my car or not."
1,"out dated, junk","this item shoud have never been sold..was out dated and did not work..tried to contact seller and no answer.now i am stuck with it, not working and out my 10.00auto alley...don't do any buying from...they won't return a email, as to what to do with broken not working item."
3,"Not great, but ok.","It almost reads like a bad summer blockbuster, but I didn't hate it. The writing itself seems very amateur, but it did have a somewhat creepiness to it at first. It could have been better as it really doesn't seem to pick up steam & goes in a direction that is very cliche & as said before, like a bad movie. If you can pick this up for a few bucks ( under $3 ) you might enjoy it for the price."
5,Bravo Alice & Emily,"Once again, Alice and Emily astonish on this disc. They have again chosen fine theatre songs and offered even finer renditions of these songs. Both ladies are in excellent voice, especially Ms. Ripley on ""Losing Track of Time."" Neither woman fails to offer her unique qualities to each song, but it is when this pair sings together that sparks fly. This disc is simply astonishing."
5,Emily and Alice have done it again...and Better!,FABULOUS. Emily and Alice remain far and away the best duet that ever was...and amazing separate. Their solos are killer as well....god....will they make a third album? I HOPE SOOO!!!! The pictures are beautiful and the liner notes [written by Emily and Alice themselves] are hyserical. There is a treat at the end again!! It's even better than the one on Duetst!! YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH. BUY NOW.
1,A Broadway Bomb,"I hated this CD. I loved their first CD ""Duets,"" but this record is horrible. There are too many comic relief numbers, which get old after, say, one listen. A lot of the production sounds very 70's cheesy. And there are too few pretty duets. And the ""bonus"" at the end is like you're listening in on two people joking around but you feel out of it because you're not really included and you don't know what they're talking about."
2,Ho Hum,"It's not that good. It's loud. Sometimes very loud. It's emotional, or rather over emotional. These girls have obviously never heard of subtlety. They are singing purely from their steel lungs and not at all from the head or the heart or the gut as truly gifted song enterpreters instinctively do. Instead Emily sings jackhammer to Alices' powerdrill and the results chase my cats out of the room every time I attempt to listen to more than a song or two. ""I Don't Know How to Love Him"" is the easiest target since it is totally devoid of humanity, but some of the others come mighty close."
5,alice and emily overcome the orchestrations,"the arrangments of the songs are decent at best, but Alice and Emily's voices make this recording work."
1,Unsuspecting Listener,"Very disappointed in this CD especially after reading the amazon listener reviews. A friend retitled the cd as ""Unsuspecting Listener"". These women are talented, but the arrangements were awful."
2,stick to the first,"i was really looking forward to this project. i admire the choice of material but would have appreciated a more straightforward interpretation of the work. the ladies have such beautiful voices when they ""mug and mock"" the material it undermines the simplicity and strength of the composer's as well as (their) the artist's work. this cd will not be listened to as much as i would have expected. i won't get rid of it but it is not on my top ten, must have, can't live without list. better luck/work next time."
5,Simply Irresistable,"I only recently acquired the amazing Side Show and instantly searched for further recordings by it's two stars...my rapture was complete when I saw their two cds...and this is the best. Who can deny their talent with such tracks as 'She's Gone', 'The Last Duet/Enough is Enough' and 'The Alto's Lament'....but also 'Friendship/Friends to the End'. I can honestly say I'll be listening to this one for a very long time...can't wait for the next one girls!"
3,A Disappointing Follow-Up,"I wanted to love it, but it just doesn't cut it like ""Duets"". These two gals are great singers, but in this effort they spend more time mugging (and borderline screaming) than singing. A couple of decent cuts, notably Alice's ""She's Gone (cut from ""Side Show"") and the plaintive ""Losing Track of Time"". But there's a reason some of these cuts are obscure: they're not worth reviving. Check out Alice & Emily's efforts on the new Stephen Schwartz compilation, where they both soar. But this CD is likely to be relegated to the bottom of my stack. I'll still buy anything these two release, but I hope it's ""back to basics"" next time."
5,Unsuspecting Hearts Rocks!,"Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley have been wonderful together since their debut in ""Side Show"". Their 2nd cd, ""Unsuspecting Hearts"" is beautiful. Both ladies have their solos which lets their voices shine. (Alice in the cut song from Side Show, ""She's Gone"" track #2 and Emily in the hilarious ""The Alto's Lament"", track # 4) Together their voices blend perfectly in songs from ""City of Angels"" (What you Don't Know About Women, track # 8) and ""THe Magic Show"" (""Solid Silver Platform Shoes"", track # 10). They do beautifully emotional songs, ""Unsuspecting Hearts"" (from ""Carrie"", track # 5) and comical songs such as ""I'm Past My Prime"" (from ""Li'l Abner"", track #6) or ""The Last Duet/Enough is Enough"" (track # 14). If angels do exist, this is what they sound like when they sing."
3,Something of a letdown,"After the almost perfect ""Duets,"" I found ""Unsuspecting Hearts"" to be something a disappointment. Overall, the material selected isn't nearly as good, there are a couple tracks that beg to be skipped, or won't bear repetition, and some are downright annoying.That said, there are at least two cuts that make this CD worth every penny: Ripley's killer ""Losing Track of Time,"" which I usually have to play three or four times straight, and ""Old Friend,"" the tear-evoking closing duet.All in all, recommended, but plan on using your track button a lot."
4,Pretty Amazing,"Overall a great CD, lots of great yet different sounding covers of great songs. Very unique voice when covering songs like Slide and Freshman."
5,Life long Yankee Fan,"Some people are shocked that a long time Yankee fan would purchase Bronson Arroyo's cd. However, I am quick to point out that Bronson can really sing. His cover songs sound just like the original artists. I really enjoy this cd and think it is an excellent selection of songs. I can't wait for the next Bronson Arroyo cd."
3,"For a singer, he's a pretty good baseball player.","I'm a huge Red Sox fan and bought this CD on a lark--it's ok. I like most of the songs he chose to cover, but he doesn't add much to the songs. He doesn't embarrass himself, but he shouldn't quit his day job."
5,"WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM ""THE KING"" ...","I'm a firm believer in diversity, so if the very popular Bronson Arroyo has more than one skill, then he's right to flaunt it! We girls like to look at him whether he's on the pitcher's mound or behind a guitar, singing his little heart out.The line-up of top-of-the-line musicians who join him on this CD make it a once-in-a-lifetime recording. And you won't want to miss the other Red Sox players on the album: Johnny Damon, Kevin Youkilis and Lenny DiNardo, along with Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein. What a line-up!And when you toss the great Stephen King into the mix, it's bound to be a winner. Stephen King? Yes, this talented, generous author contributed additional lyrics and spoken words on the fourth track ""Everlong."" Speaking of diversity!Go, guys, go! It's obvious you love what you do, and when something comes from the heart, the fans NEED to share your joy!"
3,If you are going to cover others material...,"Atleast make sure you know the lyrics first. His voice is okay for singing in the bar and having a good time, but not worth releasing an album. I'm sure Red Sox fans and other baseball fans will eat it up because he is semi-multi talented. However I for one was not impressed.again we fail....to know the lyrics...get it right....see you at a karaoke bar."
1,C'mon Bronson!,"I just have to say what a terrible production this is. First of all, the covers are complete sound-a-likes to the originals. There is absolutely NO change. Except that of the vocal performance. Listen, those songs were hits because the performances were nailed (and edited) just right. It sounds like Bronson tried to do these in only a few takes...and probably with the help of Antares AutoTune (pitch corrector).In short, nothing creative, nothing great. If you love it because he's a Red Sock, well I still don't understand. I'm a huge Sox fan, but would much rather listen to the timeless originals instead of a feable attempt to recreate what need not be recreated."
1,Worst. CD. Ever.,"Just another pseudo-sensitive whiner with a guitar. Except this guy plays baseball. He could learn a thing or two from William Hung.Charity or not, stay away from this CD, listening to it will erode your IQ."
4,Bronson's Awesome,"As any Red Sox/Bronson fan would, I immediately bought this CD. It quickly grew on me and now I listen to it over and over without ever getting sick of it. He can REALLY SING!"
5,BRONSON ROCKS,Every single song sounds like the original artist. He is very very good. Love this CD and play it a lot.
2,THIS GUIDE IS OUT OF DATE,"THIS GUIDE PURPORTS TO BE A 1999 EDITION, BUT IN FACT HAS INFORMATION AS OF 1992. AFTER 20 FACTUAL ERRORS ABOUT HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS, I STOPPED COUNTING. HOWEVER, IT IS VERY ATTRACTIVELY PRESENTED AND HAS GOOD INFORMATION ABOT THINGS THAT DONT CHANGE, SUCH AS BEACH LOCATIONS. THERE ARE BETTER CHOICES."
2,Should have been Giorgio not Sophia,I found this book to be a story of Giorgio more that Sofia. I still prefer Bertrice Small's depiction of Turkish harems. I did not find resolution at the end of the book.
3,A romance novel,"The story was too slow and the characters were very frustrating and shallow. There were some good aspects of the book. It was interesting for me to see the inside of the harem and that way of life but I am not confident on the historical accuracy of the description. I don't recommend this book except as very light reading during a vacation, perhaps."
5,A life changing/enhancing read,"Some times out of the blue, something comes into your life just at the right moment. This book is one of those things. It opens the door to bring back the magic in life. The information and the philosophy are provided to us and it is up to us whether we apply this knowledge to our lives or not. It is a wonderful book and a gift from the universe that I will treasure the rest of my days. I wholeheartedly recommend this book especially for those desiring to make their daily lives more than just the mundane grind."
5,Psychadelic Blues heavy fusion,"I can only say what heart tells me. I have this record since 1972 and even today I listen to it with emotion. ""Bye Bye Blues"", ""I'll never be lonely"" are simply marvelous. The guitar solos are unique, the drums are stunning, voice was never repeated and bass is good. I wonder why so few people bought this LP back them. All the music is unique! It's all."
4,Inventor 10 Essentials Plus review,A well structured book that follows a logical course and is relatively easy to follow. Some illustrations are not clear and certain passages have not been fully updated from version 9.
2,wrong picture,"I get that the description says ""amber"", and it is not usually red,so the earrings I received are of a light orange color, a bit dispointed, because I would have loved it to be more cherry amber.and also, the shape of the earrings is not as shown on the picture, it's more a simple oval shapenot bad, but not as expected"
2,Fine Performance Sabotaged by Poor Sound,"The sound on this DVD is Dolby Digital 2.0. The compression is severe and strips the audio of any real musicality. If you jack up the sound level and use artificial reverb you can tweak something out of this, but that is just voodoo audio, and not the real thing.In every other respect I agree with the previous reviewer about this performance, but there are other DVDs out there with better sound mastering. A blu-ray of this title would be very nice to have, someday!"
4,Very Enjoyable,I really enjoy time travel books and this book is no exception. It was very enjoyable to read though at times sad. I found it intersting and hard to put down as I wondered what the ending of this adventure could be. Great read for both boys and girls and insightful to the history of those who emigrated to America.
5,An amazing book!!!,"Red Boot's for Christmas is amazing book, that tells the true meaning of Christmas. It is very easy for children to understand and get the true meaning of what is going on.It is about a poor woman who pleades with a shoe maker to make her grandaughter a pair of shoes for Christmas because she has none. The shoe maker refuses to do it, then changes his mind because of events that occur through out the book. The book also has beautiful illustrations in it , that keep you fixed on the pages"
2,A big disappiontment,"A very disappointing DVD. Being a huge Ronnie Milsap fan, I purchased this DVD expecting to see him perform full versions of all his big hits. But alas he only sings 2 of them. ""Back in the 50's tonight"" and ""smokie Mountain Rain"" He condensed all his greatest hits into a medley the lasts only a few minutes and then spends the rest of the concert doing nostalgia and ""doo woop"" songs. Although the picture and sound quality are excellent and his voice as great as it ever was if you want a DVD of Ronnie Milsap doing all his greatest hits then the is DEFINITELY NOT THE DVD you should buy."
5,"Great performance, medium transportability","I pretty much agree with the other reviews. The computer is awesome, Toshiba keeps showing it is the leader. Esthetically way superior than Dell, great reliability and with an straighforward installation process. BUT... I would only note that in my opinion the computer is not for everyday trips school-home. It is kind of heavy and actually I found that most backpack-style computer cases do not fit this computer without being really pushed to their capacity limits (or even beyond them). Suggestion: compare carefully the dimensions of this computer and of any backpack or case you may be considering.It is basically a Great desktop replacement."
4,Very easy to learn - I love it,"I have tried other workout tapes, but don't know anything about samba dancing. But it sounded fun and I thought I'd try it. It is fun -- and it's so easy to learn. And the routines work every part of your body."
2,Hard work,"Reading the first book of ""The Autograph Man"" is most of the time very annoying. The protagonist of the story, Alex-Li Tandem, a half chinese half jewish autograph man gets drunk and stoned every day, consequently there is no real action. In the secon part of the book there is some kind of a plot, the story beginns to develope and so it gets more interessting for the reader. The open ending is a bit disappointing because the reader doesn't know how the life of Alex will go on. All in all the book contains too much unimportant details and the protagonist is a kind of a person you can't identify with nor you can like him anyway. If you have the power to finish the book you really can be proud of you!!!"
5,Consistently effective,"My Honey and I have been utilizing this measure of prevention for many years around cold season when there are a bunch of sicklies around not taking care of themselves. Kids in classrooms sling'n snot around with sneezes, cough'n, hack'n up lungs, you name it. This stuff has reliably kept us both healthy and free of any such airborn ailments.The price fluctuates, so keep an eye on it. I don't much care for paying over $13/120ct, but certainly will if I have to. It just simply works, and of course, is worth NOT getting sick for however much it costs. :) I very highly recommend getting this product if you aren't a big fan of being sick when everyone else is hack'n and gagg'n around ya.Stay healthy. It's all ya have. Lose it, and you'll know it.Ciao."
3,Excellent voice but average songs.,"Most of the songs in this CD seem to be there just to fill up the space and are nothing new or different, the kind you get tired of after hearing them a couple of times. Her voice is excellent though, I hope she has other works with better quality."
1,KATELAND,Dont waste your time with this one. LOOK ELESWHERE. It didnt do anything for me. Everything is phony. And it felt it too. Its GOODBYE SNOW DAY from me.

5,Bird? Plane? Super Diaper Baby!,"Really funny stuff. Also a compassionate story about a father who just wants to do right by his child, but feels outshined by his son's superpowers. Pilkey is a comic genius, but also a thoughtful author. Don't let the silly drawings and ridiculous plots keep you from believing that."
4,Got my daughter's attention,"I'm really very happy with the Super Diaper Baby and Captain Underpants books. Is it what I would run out and ""choose"" for my daughter to read? Not in a million years. But my daughter has been reading since she was three years old. During first grade this past school year she was tested at a fifth grade reading level. Yet she rarely read. This series has seriously sparked her interest in reading and opens the doors for more books. The ""potty humor"".....kids are going to be exposed to that with or without these books. I can remeber finding potty humor hilarioius as a kid. I say let them be kids, continue to teach them what's appropriate and when and thank God they have a desire to read. I'm thrilled to see a ""passion"" for books finally developing in my 7 year old."
4,Hilarious!,"Super Diaper Baby is really absolutely hilarious. It really has a direct line to the kid sense of humor, and the drawings are adorable and entertaining. The only problem is the humor is almost all of the bathroom variety, and it is soooo funny to kids that they will read it, and talk about it, many more times than adults might want. But one amazing book that everyone will love isBitsie VS The Collector: A Beautifully Illustrated Children's Comic Picture Book"
5,One of the best Captain Underpants books yet,If you liked the other 5 Captian Underpants books then you will like The Adventures of Super Diper Baby. I think the author wrote this book really well. He explained the book really good. The book is highly recommended.
4,"Baby, baby, BABY!","This book is very funny and its just like a kid wrote it! All of the misspelled words, very hilarious."
3,Too much potty talk,A little disappointed. Should have read reviews first. We'll stick with the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books series. My 7 yr old loves those!
1,Confusing to Young Minds and a Weak Book,"Why would you allow your child to read this book when there are so many good books which help develop correct spelling and proper values without this misguided approach? While I am not generally in favor of banning books, at all, I would make an exception for this book. The spelling and writing skills of our younger generation are clearly lacking in many of our schools and this book has compounded the problems of teaching spelling and the use of correct verb tense among other things. You can do so much better for your child !"
4,School Book Review,Have you ever seen a baby who gets Super Powers? I read a book about a baby who got super powers. The author was Dav Pilkey and the book is called Super Diaper Baby. It's funny and I'm sure you will love it as much as I did. So if you really like it you could read it about 4-6 times. So I went to Borders and bought that book. What are you waiting for go? Go and get Super Diaper Baby. It's a comic book. Have fun reading it. I wish you the best of luck . My favorite part was when Super Diaper Baby destroyed the Robo Ant 2000 and Deputy Doo Doo got really mad at Super Diaper Baby. It's going to make you read it over and over again. So don't miss Super Diaper Baby coming to a store near you.
2,A bit too simple...,"The premise of the book, our Captain Underpants heroes writing their own book is a good one, but not well-executed. The comic book style was not very engaging, and my 7 year old (a good reader, tho) was done in about 10 minutes. I missed the peals of laughter a la Professor Poopiepants, and the illustrations didn't grab him, either. This might be a good step for a reluctant reader, prior to the ""chapter books"" in this series. For us, though, this one was put down and forgotten, unlike others in the series."
1,Adventures of Super Diaper Baby,"We thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Pilkey's Captain Underpants books.Super Diaper Baby is an entirely different level of ""playground"" humor. It was more ""SouthPark"" than children's fiction. We did like the extra flip-o-ramas, but the Deputy Doo-Doo character was a bit more than most parents want to deal with. I hope the next adventure leaves the Deputy in the outhouse where he belongs. I'll be checking reader reviews before I buy another book in this series."
5,Good book!,It was a very funny book. The characters are so like real kids. The inventions are so creative that makes the story more interesting.
2,Too babyish,"My 10 yr old daughter was not impressed with this book She found this book too baby like, the pictures were too little. She thought the book was funny at times."
2,A bunch uv miss speld werds like dis.,Dare r a lott uv miss speld werds in dis book and I fink it iz kineduv anoying! Alsso the book has too much joekes uhbout poop and toylitts and stuff. Ovur den dat it iz kineduv funny but kineduv knot.
1,1/3 of the pages fell out during 1st read,"Sorry to give you a bad review, George Beard, et al. But this is the fifth time this has happened to us with one of these books. It's very disappointing, as my son gets a big kick out Captain Underpants and gang. It's just not worth buying them."
4,Kids love Dav Pilkey's Books...,"Personally I did not care much about Dav Pilkey's books, but my 7 year old son just can't get enough and that is all it matters. He had some reading problems and he just was not motivated until he was introduced these books and now he can't stop reading... he thinks they are so funny!Thank you!"
5,Hubby,A great and very funny book it is also an very entertaining book. Read this book on one hour. I liked it a lot.
1,Shame on Scholastic; Very DISAPPOINTING,"Zero stars, actually. I bought this book for my five year-old but after one reading it is going straight into the trash. This book is not appropriate for children as it is filled with extreme scatlogical humor and vulgar cartoons (e.g. Deputy Doo). Do children really need this kind of humor? Do you want them repeating this kind of language with teachers, relatives or playmates? I am a bit horrified that this book even got published. Shame on Scholastic and shame on Dave Pilkey; your fans deserve better."
4,Kindle and iPad Version,"Length:: 0:47 MinsFor those of you who may be curious how this looks on Kindle or iPad, see my video. The book has a few cartoon boxes per page. The electronic version breaks this up into one box per page.I wish all of the Captain Underpants books would be released in electronic versions. They were the first books to spark my son's love of reading."
3,decent display case,"Decent display case seems sturdy enough. Please note I did buy this for a relatively non-valuable ball and card, and for that this is just fine."
5,Exactly What I ordered,I ordered this for my son's gameball that he received and one of his baseball pictures. It was described and delivered exactly as they stated. My son loves that he can display his game ball and picture.
4,Great Buy!! Jam in E is Exellent,"(4.5 stars really) This is a really good album. Jam is a little disapointing. not his best album, but still exellent. that is why it got 4.5 instead of 5 stars. i reccomend buying it. it is a great price and a good cd overall. Their remake of ""With a little help from my friends"" is awesome. Carlos Santana is amazing as always."
3,A Good Softcover Textbook,"I attend a Catholic high school and use this textbook for my Catholic Social Teaching class. It is good for upper-elementary and high school classes as it is directed towards more mature minds, but not quite as in-depth as university students. It has plenty of pictures, that may or may not be space fillers, and graphs that don't teach us much. Everything is simple and to the point in this book, but I don't feel like it gives enough in-depth speculation on each subject it touches on. Sometimes it even mentions a topic, says one definite statement, and gives no evidence. It does, however, have plenty of examples and real-life situations. These books, sadly, are easy to ruin since they are softcovers. The activities included in this book are related to the subjects and easy enough to do."
2,I hate philosophy,Only bought it for class.... Barely read the book... Didn't like it when i read it though...
4,Good pictures and relaxation,I found this coloring book to have wonderful pictures of the Antebellum period to color in my own way and use my imagination as to how they would appear. The information at the bottom of each page was a fun lesson in style history.
5,LOVE!,I got this coloring book this summer and LOVE it! I love historical fashion especially Civil War/Old South with hoop skirts and all. The details are incredible and it's great how it shows you how to color and explains it. If you like historical fashion like me then you definitely need to get this!
4,MIssed opportunity,"As referred to in other reviews, this movie is piggy-backing on the recent crop of 2012 disaster movies. That stated, and as my title implies, this was a missed opportunity by the producers. If they had increased the budget for state-of-the-art special effects, put in a little more details, and expanded the script by about a 1/2 an hour or more, this could have been a major summer movie or, more probably, a better-than-average made-for-TV movie.This is a good show with a good premise and your average, and sometimes better-than-average, acting by some TV actors: Micha Collins/""Supernatural"", Torri Higginson/""Stargate: Atlantis"", Hill Harper/""CSI: NY"" etc.This is, also, one of the few efforts by the Syfy channel (I really hate that aconym) that is definitely worth a look and possibly a purchase."
2,Sounded better on paper,"Man, what a downer. Got this because i'm a Misha Collins fan, but this is a weak film by almost any standard, with all its potential lost in bad writing, weak transition and squandered opportunities for suspense. Plot seems good in theory, with stonehenge revealed as some kind of ancient machine that is gearing up to terraform the planet...at the expense of killing mankind. But a subplot involving a cult leader is laughable, and the military response of attempting to nuke the ancient site to stop the end of the world seems straight out of a 50s black and white film. Rent it, don't buy it."
5,The perfect bad movie,"If you want something hilarious and bad, this is the film for you! I watched it before buying it and was so confused and so in love I just had to buy it. Misha Collins is an amazing actor and I highly recommend you watch some of his work, as long as it isnt Karla. He said ""This is a film made for people who are drunk"" and he was absolutely correct. Great for parties!"
3,ROLLING STONES,"This somewhat cheesy morality/disaster tale is enjoyable escapist fare. The hidden pyramid is pretty effective while the others are typical low-budget fx.Misha Collins (SUPERNATURAL) acquits himself well as the brilliant albeit ridiculed puzzle solver, but CSI NY's Hill Harper is surprisingly weak as the fanatical antagonist.Some of the movie is incredulous, but typical for a SyFy channel offspring. I would rent it or get it used on Amazon."
4,Great Movie.,I purchased this video for my son for Christmas. He never dislikes anything dealing with destruction!!!Thank you for providing it so promptly.
3,Mediocre,"I am glad I only rented this one. I was stretching a little to even give it the 3 stars I gave it. Aside from the fact that it is just a bit too incredible, there are too many cliches here for me: the teacher/professor who instantly knows more about everything than the experts who have been studying the events, the clock counting down to zero, when the world will be destroyed, and the hero saving it at the last second- sorry if that's a spoiler, but if you don't have it figured out by halfway through the film, you don't watch many movies. Then there is a project going on 10,000 feet below ground level in Maine, USA, which has Egyptian Hieroglyphics involved. I don't mind this type of thing if there is even a tiny bit of explanation, but there was none. Add to this the fact that left hand drive vehicles were being used in England, and a U.S. Military Commander had an American Flag on his uniform backwards, and you are simply asking viewers to overlook too much."
4,SciFi action,"I enjoyed it after a fashion. Not as good as some, but OK to put in the long list of SciFi movies."
4,Bible Maps - Then and Now,"The overlays are good, but three overlays on one paper map gets confusing for the different time periods in history. It is difficult to read through the three overlays. I a reading the chronological bible and I am trying to follow where these Biblical events took place and the cities invovled. In many cases for the time period involved the cities are not represented on the map. Howvever,the time periods chosen are good.Bill Huseonica"
2,Nice but maps are too small,"I purchased this book, interested in learning more as I studied the Bible. I was very disappointed to see that the maps are very tiny, with several on each page. They are not very detailed and some of the maps have multiple overlays that I could not read through.I also bought the Son Light Book of Bible Maps from Son Light Publishers. I like it much better because all the maps are full page size with only one overlay, and it's much easier to find what you are looking for and read. There are also more maps and some study guides and a timeline."
3,Works for simple use,"This book is good for simple use. It has helped with my bible study, especially relating modern day areas with the biblical lands. However, I just saw the deluxe version and also the bible insert version (go to[..]) and wished I had researched a bit more before I had plunked down my $20 (should have bought it on Amazon, huh)."
5,Excellent Product,Very pleased with this book. I used it as aid to teaching Bible class. The modern names of the cities and the modern boundaries were quickly linked to the Bible time names. I happily recommend this item.I received this purchase in timely manner and it was as advertised as to condition.
1,worst recording ever,This video was recorded by amateurs and is the worst quality I have ever seen/heard. It should not be sold by Amazon.
5,Great for learning,"Got these scissors as stocking stuffers for my 2.5 year olds. They look great, haven't tried them yet. Got them for practice."
2,Frustrated daughter,"I own several Fiskars products and never had an issue, so I bought these Fiskars for my 4 year old daughter after she misplaced a pair of Melissa and Doug scissors. My daughter has been using scissors for over 2 years now and never had an issue, but has had nothing but problems with these. My daughter found it awkward to find a proper finger placement and then couldn't hold a consistent amount of pressure to successfully complete her assignment. Will be scrapping these pre-school scissors and buying another pair of Melissa and Doug."
2,Disappointed :(,"I bought these for my 3 yr old granddaughter. She became very frustrated and wouldn't use them any more. In trying to convince her to try again, I picked them up in an attempt to show her how to use them. They were hard for ME to use! They are awkward, clumsy and difficult. Very disappointed, was counting on the Fiskars name to give me a quality pair of first scissors for my little one. Still looking..."
2,Not so great.,These are really hard to use. My son is three and a half and it seems like they are really hard to push together for him. Its much easier for him to use the traditional safety sissors.
4,Love these,I bought these scissors for my daughter when she was about 2.5 or 3 and we have used the same pair for our other two children as well. The child does not have to struggle to get the scissors open because they just pop up! Have you ever seen a small child use a regular pair of children's scissors? They have one handle in the left hand one in the right so that they can pull the scissors open. Not so with these. :)The only thing that I find disappointing about these is that they are so hard to find in stores. :(
2,I'd like better quality,I purchased these scissors for my two year old. The first pair came off of the plastic so when you cut the metal part just moved up and down. The second pair teeth rub when you try and cut something. they were a good thought but my son has a hard time figuring out how they work.
1,don't buy,"I bought these scissors for my almost 3 year old thinking they would be great for helping her learn to use scissors, but alas, a waste of money. She was quickly frustrated with them. They are really hard to close and she couldn't seem to put her thumb in the right spot to use them. The thumb has to be at just the right place to put enough pressure on them to close them.I pulled out the Melissa & Doug plastic scissors I already had ( a few months ago she was having trouble with them) and she quickly got the hang of them this time around. So, don't buy these. Just wait for your kid to be able to start with regular scissors."
5,Fiskars Preschool Scissors,"My daughter got up on her stool to get our big and not kid safe scissors, so we got her these. She loves them. with the hinge, she wraps her hand on the outside of the finger slots and they still work. Her little brother tries to use them to and with the covered ends, I am not worried that he will poke himself or something(or one) else. The ones we got were red, so if you want a specific color keep this in mind. Color was not an issue with us. We also got a couple of the Kumon books for cutting and folding(daughter is always asking how to make oragami and we don't know)."
3,"Easy to use, but won't encourage proper technique","I purchased these for my 2 1/2 year old as his first scissors. While they are easy to use and definitely good on the safety end, the fact that they are spring loaded to return to the open position seems to encourage my son to remove his fingers from the intended position inside the finger holes and just squeeze from the outer most portion of the handles. I just ordered the blunt end Fiskars; we'll see how he handles those."
2,Running with Scissors...to the Trashcan,"I totally agree with the negative reviewers...yessiree, five years since I have purchased these scissors and I am still bummed that they actually made excursions into the world of scissors more difficult for everyone in general. And think about it- did you ever meet a kid in elementary school missing the tips of his fingers? I have never witnessed one scissors accident involving kids (read: kids) in my entire lifetime, nor have heard urban myth/horror rumors detailing the bloody experiences of scissors and sniffly preschoolers. Hey, it comes naturally anyway...my 3.99 year old has been cutting by herself with hobbit-sized, tot-geared, ""regular"" Fiskars scissors for about a year and a half now, sans hovering directional guidance due to the fact that I was just too busy and weary to offer said guidance. Yes, closing the maw of this resisting cutting instrument is futile, however, resisting this purchase is not futile."
2,Disappointing phone...,"I purchased this phone last year sometime and have been using it since. I am not very pleased with the phone for numerous reasons. Let me break it down in list form.PROS:1) Small, compact, light2) Good LCD screen, bright, good colors3) Pretty decent camera4) Good layout of the buttons that are inside the phone (not the exterior side ones); easy to pressCONS:1) Side buttons get mashed inadvertently when stuck in your purse or pocket. This causes it to make a sound as it changes your settings. Very annoying to have to reset it back to what you had it to before2) Intermittent freezing of phone. I'm not sure if it is the phone's operating system or if it is just a defective unit. Either way, it is annoying for me to have to open and close then try to power off and power on the phone to get it to respond again.3) Slow response to buttons being pressedI am looking at other phones to buy to replace this one. If I were you, I'd look into other phones with similar options and features."
4,GREAT... BUT NOT THE BEST,"I bought this phone for full price and it works great. The camera takes good pictures and the ringtone quality is awesome, even mp3. I love the speakerphone but you can only get to speakerphone once a call has been connected. Also The phone is a bit on the large side, but the keys are great size and spaced out perfect. this has been rated one of the best phones for Cingulars GSM 850/1900 band network for its reception and call quality. The screen is also great but id like to see it have an external color LCD for photo caller id and as a photo viewfinder."
2,"Looks good, functions bad","I got this phone in June 2004...after about 6 monhts, I noticed that the volume level was bad...it's so bad now that when people want to use my phone, they can't hear who they're calling because they don't know that you have to hold the phone TIGHT to the ear to hear anything! I love the phone, otherwise, I don't want to replace it, but looks like i'm going to have to......"
1,"Poor phone, worse service from Cingular","I've owned this phone for more than a year. It is bulky, slow-to-charge, prone to inadvertant changes in settings and finally, the keys are not easy to dial (number keys require very firm pressure, making one-hand dialing difficult). The sticky-key problem became so severe (no, it wasn't dropped in liquid)that I called Cingular while the phone was still in warranty. They sent another V400, which they claim was reconditioned. The replacement phone had no battery (you're supposed to keep the old one) and the face of the replacement was scratched and had clearly been abused. I kept the old phone and am switching service providers. Bad phone. bad service."
1,Having difficulties ordering too...,"I tried to order the phone as well and getting declines from Amazon, even though I have excellent credit history and I'm an existing customer with Cingular.Does anybody know the number at Cingular where I can call and get an approval for Amazon's order?Thanks!"
4,Good Phone..Just A Few Minor Things,"I brought my phone October of last year from the Cingular website..This is my very 1st flip phone & only reason I picked this phone was because it had really good features, its cute & it has mobile IM which is AIM & YIM..I was happy it had both of those on this phone because I love chattin with my friends soo I could be on both even when I'm on the go..However it has very bad reception..I give it 4 stars tho because it does not work inside buildings you have to talk outside & thats something I hate, but they have antennas for that, that can boost up your reception which I brought soo now I have no problems I can talk on my phone in buildings soo really I have no complaints..Its a good phone has great volume & a good camera just gotta constantly keep the lens clean otherwise your pictures won't turn out clear..I can't speak for others but I'm very pleased with my cell phone those are the only problems I had but I fixed it sooo overall I'm happy"
1,do NOT buy this phone,"I have had this phone for about 5 months now and I'm getting rid of it as soon as possible.It drops calls when I have full service.It randomly just won't ring when I have service, just beeps when someone leaves me a voicemail.On a clear day, if I stand in the exact same spot the service will go from 5 bars to 0 bars and then back up to 5.I have the media text messaging and that randomly won't work.After I've fully charged the battery I'll receive a 10 min. phone call and all of the sudden the battery will go dead.My husband is on the same plan as I am and has a Nokia phone. He has never had any problems, so we know that it's not the service.My advice to you is not the buy this phone...my husband has had 2 different Nokia phones in the past few years and has never had a problem with any of them. I have had 2 Motorola phones and have had continuous problems with them."
4,Moto v400,"The motorola is Cingular's best offering (right now). the phone has a very high resolution screen (176 by 220) . I love the sound quality and even speakerphone has good sound and the other party can hear me. The mp3 ringtones are fun, but often expensive. The camera resolution is normal ( VGA or 640 by 480 ) In general this is a solid phone that I would strongly recomend, please e-mail me with any questions, ( DrSmile2@aol.com)"
1,Very Complicated Phone and Terrible Reception,I have now had my V-400 for a year. I still don't know how to use most features because they use a icon system that is not intuitive.I have dropped calls all the time and most calls are garbled.I would not buy this phone again.
1,Bad Phone,"my husband had not one, but two of these phones in less than a year and they were both lemons! The first one he had, the person on the other end could not hear you talking at all - it was like no one was there! The phone was brand new! He had it replaced with the same phone and this one you could not hear anything on it! He finally sent it back and just got a totally different brand of phone entirely. I don't know if we just got two bad phones or if this phone is just not a good phone. Either way, we'll never have another one!!!"
1,Cingular service is deceptive,"My review is on Cingular. I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used. THEY LIE. THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY. THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area. If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular. Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse."
1,webmerch,1- The worst manual(documentation) i have ever seen for a cell phone2- Side-mounted buttons that make it difficult to so much as pick up the phone without inadvertently activating something3- Gave it to my kids as a toy since this is absolutley garbage. No wonder you make money by choosing this phone(Rebate)!4- I can not believe Motorola makes junk these days!
5,A must read for all PHP Programmers,"This book is just what the PHP community needs. I come from a strong C++ background, and I have struggled with the huge amounts of poorly written PHP code out there. The PHP community needs to step up and become professional, and this book is a must read for anyone that wans to create solid software. This book touches on the most important aspects of high level software design using PHP. It also provides some usefule code and examples to help illustrate the benefits of proper Object Oriented design."
1,Needed to be reviewed.,"This book would have a lot of potential if only it had been edited properly. There are simply too many inconsistencies and outright mistakes for me to give this book a good review. The concepts are nice, and ideas good, and the wording easy to read. Problem is, I don't feel I can trust any of the examples, and I learn by example. It doesn't feel like the authors bothered to read their own book."
3,Buyer Beware,"I like the topics covered in this book. However, there are a number of grammatical errors throughout and the codes in the book are full of errors. If you're up for the challenge of surfing the books forum page at [...] to find code fixes, then this book is for you. But, if your not the adventurous type and like codes to work out of the box then this book isn't for you."
5,Perfection! This is a CD to remember every Christmas season,"Amy Grant is one of the best female singers of our time. She feels the songs of Christmas from her heart and succeeds in her new CD as she has with her past two. There is something about Amy and a Christmas song. She gives us one of the best versions of Silent Night I have ever heard. She also comes through with the outstanding title cut from the CD. The only mediocre song on this CD is Mr Santa. Though a clever remake of Mr. Sandman, it is beneath Amy's great talent."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Amy's third Christmas CD (the 4th if you count the ""Animals Christmas"" collaboration with Art Garfunkel) is by far the weakest of the batch.There's little of the festive frolic or energy of the earlier releases and in fact Amy's vocal performance sounds just plain tired and melancholy on many of these songs.The project starts off with a pretty good bang with the title song and then it's all downhill from there.>The bonus track of ""Merry Christmas Darling"" is not on this version but it's no great loss. Amy's take on the Carpenters classic contains little of the sparkle or passion of the original."
5,AN ALBUM TO REMEMBER,"The holidays are here and what better way to celebrate them with beautiful Christmas music from our favorite recording stars.....Did Amy Grant outdo herself this year on her new Christmas Album? You bet she did!....Some of my favorite highlights on this album are the delightful title track ""A Christmas to Remember"", ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away""... also a very delightful tune taken from the old song ""Mister Sandman"" re-titled for the holidays""Mister Santa""...and the beautiful ""Welcome To My World"".. just a beautiful album all the way through...It's not Christmas in my household without a Amy Grant Christmas Album playing in the background...Buy it folks,you won't be disappointed...Simply Beautiful!"
2,hidden surprise- Merry Christmas Darling,"Not a bad album but not great either. First three cuts are the best, and ""Mr. Santa"" is fun, but the two instrumentals and the closing classical piece are overblown. Amy seems disconnected from it all. She is still a good writer, but on this disc, her vocals sound as if she is going through the motions. If you purchase this disc at Target, the bonus cut is the Carpenters classic. Certainly nice, even includes the multilayered vocal ending, but it sure made me appreciate (again) the rich uniqueness of Karen Carpenter's voice. ""Home for Christmas"", the 2nd Amy Christmas disc, (not counting ""Animals Christmas"" with Art Garfunkel) is a much better project."
2,"Stick to ""Home for Christmas""!","Now, i have been a big fan of Amy Grant's christmas albums, since ""home for christmas"" which is the best christmas album ever in my opinion. it offered everything you could imagine, from the beautiful ""Breath of Heaven"", to classics like ""Have yourself a merry little christmas"". but this one falls way short. i was anxious to put it on, and i was a bit dissapointed. the first track is a bit corny and suggests ""listening to nat king cole"", and is not a very memorable song. the tracks are a bit bland and sometimes you dont even know the tracks are changing! the best song (and stupidest) is Mister Santa, which cries Mister Santa Bring me some Toys! We've wiped our nosies!"" and stuff like that. its a fun song. its an alright christmas album, but i would DEFINATELY go with Home for Christmas. this one doesnt measure up at all."
1,A Giant Snooze,"I have probably 30 Christmas CD's by various artists, including Amy Grant's first X-mas album, which is the very best one in my entire collection. This new one, however, is the worst in the entire collection. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Couldn't wait til it ended. I don't have to worry about wearing this one out! Anybody wanna buy a used (once) CD? I'll sell it to you REAL Cheap!"
1,No One Sings Christmas Like Carpenter,"I was pleased to hear Merry Christmas Darling at the end of this album, as I think it is such a great Christmas song. But it only made me want to hear Karen's magical voice again. Amy does an alright job, but Karen blows it away. The rest of this album is alright, but not worth a fuss over. If you have either of Grant's other two Christmas albums, you have enough. Meanwhile, if you don't have the carpenters ""Christmas Collection"" look it up on Amazon, read the reviews and buy it quick!"
1,A Christmas to forget,"Verrrrrry disappointing. I loved Grant's first two Christmas offerings and looked forward to listening to her 3rd. I was so bummed by this cd that I had to run to the store and pick up a few other new Christmas records (A Christmas Story by fellow christian singers Point of Grace and the new wavish ""Happy Christmas Vol. 2,"" both of which I loved) to erase the pain!"
2,Nobody does Christmas like Amy but....,"Absolutely no one does Christmas like Amy Grant. She seems inspired by God as she presents Christmas to the masses. However, for those of you who don't have any Amy Christmas albums and are looking to buy some Amy Christmas...do not get this one. ""Home for Christmas"" and ""A Christmas Album"" both get five plus stars and are absolutely brilliant. This one falls very short. If you already have Amy's first two--then definitely get this one to complete her Christmas trilogy, but if not--then immediately purchase one or both of her first two."
5,The Best!!!,"I love all of Amy Grant's CD's and Christmas CD's, but this is definitely her best Christmas CD of all!"
2,Not a Christmas you want to remember,"I love Amy Grant, but this was not a Christmas to remember. The music is so bland and her renditions of some of these songs are tired. After hearing this album I gave it to the dog to chew up. Good Coco."
2,not very good,"I bought this CD having high expectations because Amy Grant's previous two Christmas CD were so great. There were only a couple good songs. I love ""Welcome to our World."" But on the whole, I don't care for the CD."
1,The Third Time is NOT a Charm,"I'm a longtime Amy Grant fan, but this album just doesn't cut it for me. Most of the songs are mediocre at best. Sure, there's the symphony, and sure there's some nice vocals, but the song selection is poor. Her second Christmas album is clearly superior in both quality and song selection. I'll be listening to ""Home For Christmas"" a lot this year, but not the new one. I guess Amy can't be expected to come through every time."
4,Awesome Music!,"I just saw Amy in her Christmas concert this past weekend on my birthday! She was so wonderful. I'll have to say I was never happy about her going main-stream and I don't like her new music that much but I still love her! The concert blew me away. The songs were so wonderful. I wasn't in the Christmas mood, being Thanksgiving weekend and all but she put on a Wonderful show w/Michael W. Smith, Point of Grace and the Katinas. But her songs were more than just Christmas songs we've heard year after year. There were some new ones which were really awesome! Overall, I have to say I love it!"
2,"Looks fine, but skips when playing :-(","I'm pretty sure the description was ""like new"". The disc arrived and it did look like new. However, when played the disc skips terribly making the purchase worthless."
4,Perfect for an evening of present wrapping!,"Amy Fans! Fear not that this is her 3rd Christmas album. Amy has done it again. If ""Breath of Heaven"" makes you cry, you will love ""Chistmas Lullaby"". ""Til the Season Comes 'Round Again"" is good for your sentimental side. And there's plenty of cheer, too. It's obvious Amy Grant loves Christmas for all the right reasons - Jesus, family and a great time. Happy Holidays!"
4,synopsis,"Prof. X's son, David aka Legion, wants to help his daddy with his quest for homo superior-homo sapien relationship. There's a problem. Legion plans to travel 20 years in the past to kill Magneto. A team of the Xmen are on his taril to stop him. He cannot succeed or the present will go wrong. Will they have to kill Legion to stop him? Or will he kill them to get to Magneto?"
3,John Tropea back again (after all these years),"It's nice to see John Tropea back in the game. His latest record is a nice effort bringing back some memories from the past (listen to ""to touch you again"" if you can!).Listen to John's version of ""Change the World"" (quite different from Eric Clapton's version), or ""Willy T."" (which might be both a reference to his bass player and a nice bar on an old ship in the B.V.I.)"
5,A Good Information Book on Wooden Hand Planes,Bought this book to learn about all the wooden planes I was collecting for years.I learned some very interesting things I did not know. Some of the planes I had were worth a lot more than I thought. I now know which planes are worth more when I see them at yard sales. A Good Buy!
1,Junk,"Sounds like it was recorded in a phone booth. Also, no length on any tracks, and only four tracks. Don't be a cheapskate, get Star Time by the Godfather of Soul."
5,THE MAN OF SOUL,"When You Mention Soul James Brown's Name always Comes Up.His Grooves,Signatures&Dropping of The Beat were all created by this Genius.You Can Never Get Enough Of This Genius.He hits your Soul With His Voice&Music.His Talent is Still Amazing Nearly 50 years Later."
5,An excellent introduction to the Enneagram.,"This workbook is clear, concise, and practical. In my opinion it's one of the best introductory books on the Enneagram available. Mark Sumner Enneagram Training & Development Institute"
4,How to install this guitar's amp battery:,"There have been a lot of posts here and at Musician's Friend saying how annoying the battery installation is, but no one has deigned to post a solution once they figured it out.Well, it's pretty simple: rather than trying to put the battery straight in, angle it to the side and pivot it in. It might not work the first time, but that's the way to do it."
1,junk,"A re-recording. To quote from the back of the CD: ""Tracks that feature groups may not include all the original members."" This is junk."
3,"Shake, Rattle & Roll","Bill Haley would shoot the producer for calling this CD, his greatest hits albeit it does include three biggies such as Rock Around the Clock, See You Later Alligator and Shake, Rattle and Roll plus The Saints Rock n Roll which is Bill's rendition of When the Saints Come Marching In. The other six tracks are fair to mundane.If you are buying for your MP3 player, you are paying with shipping, slightly less than what you would pay for the downloads. So, I would not dismiss this album as some reviewers suggest.However, there are various oldies compilation albums that have these hits and much other and therefore are a better bargain."
2,Not that good,The first four tracks are very memerable because I liked them since I was round about 6. The rest is rubbish. This is also not much of a Greatest Hits Collection as it only contains 10 tracks. Do not buy.
4,An album that's still swinging a half century on,"Chris Connor comes out a fertile period in jazz for vocalists. Like those other two greats, Anita O'Day and June Christy, Connor is a Stan Kenton alumnus. And like them she has a sound of her own that is not quite like anyone else's. I've known aficianados to complain about Connor being off-key. Whatever. The albums she made for Bethlehem in the 50s and this one of the group she did for Atlantic in the 50s and 60s can legitimately be called ""classics."" This particular recording has her totally swinging and infectiously delightful version of ""Witchcraft,"" which for me would alone be worth the price of admission. She's always accompanied by first-class players. (Her Gershwin collection on Atlantic is another must.) If you dig jazz singers, Connor is someone you need to have in your collection. This is not her most essential album but it's damn good."
5,Talking Turkeys,Enjoyable poetry read! I bought it for one poem that uses punctuation anyway the poet wants.
5,Long -awaited contribution,"I am glad someone had finally put together a collection of true horse stories. The stories in this book are not all amazing, but most are only subtly enchanting. They will warm your heart, sometimes bring you to tears. There are, of course, a few astounding tales told in this book. To state an example: the boy who had never spoken before until he saw a pony and said 'Oh! pony!'Some stories have been contributed by popular equestrian personalities and some others have been written about famous equines. You will find stories of courage, kindness, survival, friendship, and success. I am sure it was a great effort from Kimberly Gatto to put together a book like this. The horse world needed this generous contribution as it helps soften the hearts of those who deal with horses. Truly an inspiration."
2,Poor choice for playing back prerecorded DVDs,"I'm sure this is a great *recorder* but I'm returning it because it's a substandard *player* or prerecorded discs. I'm posting this note just as an FYI for anyone who might be considering using this primarily for playback.Prerecorded movies did not look good on my new 40"" LCD flat panel. Even using the component video output, ""The Lord of the Rings"" appeared blurry and there were too many ""jaggies"" even when I adjusted the progressive scan playback settings. Worst of all, it couldn't seem to output in the right aspect ratio, so everything appeared squashed. (After a few hours of playing with the aspect ratio settings on both the player and the TV, I was able to get the image close to normal, but it was still slightly squished). Anyway, I returned this and got an ""upscaling"" DVD payer with an HDMI output and WOW it looks a whole lot better now. It was only $100, but of course it can't record."
3,Harmed by rather poor compression,"I find that the quality of capture off of the tuner [at all time lengths] is inferior to the Panasonic that I had previously. The machine has, however, been very reliable compared to that unit (which failed just outside a year and was very finicky about media)."
4,Comes with only ONE mit,"Good product all around. seemed to be of good quality. But I didn't test it though because I missed all the subtle clues that there was only ONE mitt in the package. I had planned to work with some buddies that night, but I returned it in order to get a SET of mitts."
3,decent,"construction was cheap. chicom...would be ok for non-serious use. invest in better mitts. also, would recommend curved MMA impact mits for harder strikes. the flat ones do not form well, esp these w/ the loose gloves"
4,Fun but difficult....,"i'm playing the game and on the east coast sunny days don't often i should have gotten the game in the summer...anyway this time around the overall gameplay isn't as linear as the first(more then one weapon,sun light is not absoulutely need)this time sometimes it's better to play in the dar k i won't spoil but fairly big shock this time around but the difficult factor is a little bit more forgiving with easy controls and fairly good graphics this game is a bit like Legend of zelda:link to the past,also the solar sennsor is a big gimmick in a good way(it does't use it as a support to cover up flaws in anyway)"
1,please spare yourself the pain,"Please do not buy this game, it may look fun but it's not. I bought it and it was fun, but if you die you have to pay 100-200 sol, if you run out of sol, you have to borrow from the dark loans. If you dont pay what you took times 8, youll have to go to the punishment room and press A rapidly depending on how much you took. I couldnt push it that many times cause i had 3000 sol to pay back and had to sell/start over. PLEASE, SPARE YOURSELF THE PAIN, TIME, AND EFFORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Classic Neil but just that,"I am a Neil fan, I love this album, I have it in vinyl from the original release date. If you are a Neil fan, you know it wasn't re-released for QUITE a while. This is a 5 star album BUT; this release however, is a disappointment. Not multi-channel, no better quality than the vinyl, a few nice snapshots of Neil from back in the day. That said, if you don't have the version of ""Hurricane"" from ""Star & Bars"", you need to buy this."
4,True fans won't be disappointed!,"I found this album in the cut-out section of a record shop when I was like 20 years old. I never heard of it but it was Neil so I gave it a try. Don't be fooled by the price!!!! If you're a fan you'll listen to this often & it won't ever collect dust in your CD shelf!!!I'd put this type of music near the same category as ""Harvest"", ""Everyone Knows This is Nowhere"", ""After the Gold Rush"" and ""Comes a Time""."
3,raunchy neil sound,"still good. great memories. nothing clean or lean about it, but good raunchy neil sound of old."
5,One of my favorites of all time!,This cd has such a good feel to it. You hardly ever hear mention of this cd but it is one of my favorites of Neil Young. Makes me want to get up and ride a Palamino to the nearest bar!
4,Classic Neil,"Even better than I remembered it. If you're a Neil fan, this has to be in your collection."
5,Pretty,Again typical Breyer tradition in making a very nice horse. This ornament I like because Secretariat's blinders and the jockey's silks make it stand out on my tree.
3,"If you're new to kids, this will help you.","I've been working with kids for a long time. These ideas were not new to me, but if you are new to science or new to working with kids, you will enjoy them."
1,"Fun, but old ideas","The ideas in this book have been around for a long time in many different books. I would pass this one up for something new. There's another book out called ""The Best of WonderScience"" you might like better."
3,"Very strange, almost R-rated depictions of Welsh people","I own the 1984 version, so perhaps the newer version has been changed. However, the practice dialogues in the book are very strange, as they feature a lot of drinking and extramarital affairs.For instance, in the photo-dialogue for chapter 1, a housewife coaxes a salesman into bed (with a photo of the two of them in the bed!) and the student gets to learn such important phrases as ""The husband is coming"" and ""D**n, the clothes are not by the bed, what can we do?"" Another lesson involves a husband tricking his wife into going on vacation at a nudist colony and then getting her pregnant (no pictures of THAT, mind you, but they do show the couple drinking). You get the impression that Welsh people spend all their time getting drunk and/or having sex.A very odd little book."
5,for all to see....,i have been a die hard inxs fan for many many years. this is the best dvd of their best videos to watch...especially taste it!! buy it!!
4,"a FEW ommisions, but a great collection","The few, earlier mentioned, missing videos notwithstanding ( I Send a Message, one of my particular favourites, and Good Times, from the movie the Lost Boys ) this is a great collection. A time capsule, if you will, of one of the best bands to come out of the early eighties. These guys were no cookie-cutter, corporate manufactured ""boy band"" ( although they certainly had plenty of sex appeal ). Great live, too, as the exclusive live cuts show them as a tight powerhouse, blending funk and rock and dance like few others have managed. A little lost for direction after the mega -hit KICK album, they kinda went scattershot as far as musical styles go, but never lost sight of gorgeous melodies and wonderfully energetic performances ( Beautiful Girl is one of my favourite tracks here, and it dates from the early nineties, when INXS weere well past their heyday). Overall, for fans of INXS, a must have."
5,a must have for any fans,"Finally a collection worth having.I've been a fan for about 20 years (and i'm only 29...).I have all their albums, know all their songs,but they still managed to surprise me with a few rare and unreleased tracks.As far as the videos are concerned, fans will already have seen them all,but they're all introduced by the band members. The 2cd dvd is amazing,there is footage of concerts from way back and also some from 1997.It's an amazing dvd and any fan should really get it."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was quite disappointed in this book, which is fairly self indulgent on the authors' part and doesn't offer much useful information. If you've never thought about buying vintage baby items and don't have much imagination, it might be a good starting point. However, it is quite limited.For one thing, the photos and items featured in the book are almost exclusively mid-century in vintage (50s and 60s), which is certainly not the only vintage style in the world or the only style available at flea markets. Also, don't expect to see any photos of nurseries or other rooms, not even a wall or a whole crib. All the photos are of single items or small vignettes, which are often extracted on a white background with no context. Oh, and the pages of ""resources"" for flea market shopping are useless for most readers outside of NY/NJ and the Chicago area.I will keep looking for a good inspiration book for vintage nursery style"
4,A wonderful little film!,"This film is a beautiful little ""diddy"" about a dirt car race in upstate NY.It is well filmed and edited and we just love it. We have brought more copies so we can share it with our friends and family."
3,Trancey chill-out but NOT world music,"After reading the reviews below, I thought I would love this CD. However, I wouldn't classify it as world music at all. It's all dub-n'-bass techno groove with various sampled instruments and voices. Also, I was expecting more influence from India or the middle east, but alas, had to settle for spanish guitar and celtic riffs.Those considering this album may want to try Mythos, which I find to be much better orchestrated. If you are looking for world trance, try Tabla Beat Science, who combine tabla masters and DJs for a real techno-India sound."
5,MY HEART IS ON FIRE...,"...and pounding as I write this. Will I explode? Well, if do, for the love of God, allow me to plead with music lovers everywhere NOW. IF you truly love Music, you are not to be without this Magical fusion of world which blends haunting, transcendent Passion and mind-boggling, mysterious Depth of such Power that it pierces like a flaming sword to the center of your being!ENTWINED & ENTRANCED has done just that to me. I am entwined and entranced under its spell but it is a liberating one that all seekers wish to find because it proves to us there is magnificent beauty to be discovered and we found an example right here! So let us be vigiliant with our search. There is joy in the JOurneY. I can boldly state that it is a top 10 cd of all-time for me from a music collection of more than 200 cds that will keep growing. Entwined and Entranced is a part of my yearning, burning, soaring heart both now and forever.""Sacrifice those little fears"" andSoar!"
5,Brilliant society analyst Mitford on most brilliant society,"Nobody understood the nuances of aristocratic society better than the Mitford sisters. No aristocratic society ever had more nuances than Louis XIV's.That background and Nancy Mitford's witty prose make her study of Louis and her court so readable that her exhaustive research and genuine scholarship may be overshadowed.To the unitiated, Louis is a gilt and ormalu figure rather than one of the most interesting personalities in European history. Anyone new to the Louis fascination will be infected, but Mitford's biography is also deep enough for readers who know much more.Most biographers of Louis understand how interesting, funny, and complex his personality and long life were. Mitford explains this phenonomen well, and illustrates his personality by examining Louis's family, court, and surroundings.Mitford lived near Versailles for many years and draws from hundreds of original French documents."
5,Classic Copy,"If you are remotely interested in the social dealings of France in the seventeenth century, then this a great book to buy. Not only does it cover all of Louis' mistresses, illegitimate children, unloved wife, and building escapades but also his own development as a king. Great for any person interested in societies of past, and how people thought."
5,dora,my daughter is very happy with it she loves dora the explorer. it was a very good christmas present yay
4,Atomic Kitten,maybe you have heard their monster hit Whole AGain..this is Atomic Kittens debut album..it's a great album with good vocals good beats and it's a great debut...they have a mixture of pop/dance/R&B feel...great songs...My top five songs form this album:1. Whole again..this song sent them to the big time around the world...2. Eternal Flame...a remake of the bangles #1 hit ..a beautiful ballad..3. Bye Now..it has a mixed up chorus...4.Tomrrow& tonight..an up beat and cool track5. you are...a great songall together this album is great...brillant
4,Pas Mal Du Tout!!,"Although I initially discredited AK as just another girl band, I'm pleased to say they have grown, although I do fear that they are straying from their initial fun style of music (heralded by my faves on the album Right Now - extremely catchy _ & I Want Your Love) to more mid-tempo type songs which have yielded them uber-stardom in the UK (Whoel Again & Eternal Flame,both of which were No 1). Add to that an additional 2 hits (See Ya & You Are) & you have a lot of singles, a lot of fans & increased interest. Who knows if they'll be around in years to come, but the music's good now if you like this sort of thing."
5,A great CD for everyone!,"I'm a big fan of Atomic Kitten. They are simply the best. The songs on this album are fun and really nice to listen to. I know it is expensive, but believe me it's worth it. My personal favorites are: Whole again, Eternal Flame, and Tomorrow & Tonight. But I advise you to buy the new version of "" Right now"" featuring the new kitten "" Jenny"", plus there two new tracks to listen to. Listen to what I'm saying and BUY the CD. You'll thank me afterward."
4,Another import I can't wait to see in the USA,"Why is it I always have to pick the Imports to like, before they make it to the U.S.? Well, just like the A-Teens, I found Atomic Kitten thanks to the Internet and now own every CD I could order from them. I love some of the covers they have done on other albums and enjoyed Eternal Flame on this album.The only way I've been able to describe them to friends is that they are a grown up version of A-Teens. Almost a dance-mix version of everything, yet not the over-done dance stuff where good music is corrupted by playing an entriely different backbeat behind a slower song. Atmoic Kitten makes dance music sound like dance music, they way it was meant to be!"
1,Once your a member you can't get out!!!,I signed up for this magazine for my boyfriend. He's an avid bass fisherman. He wasn't impressed with the magazine so I decided not to renew my subscription...yeah right. I've sent them a cancellation notice but they keep send me junk in the mail. The latest junk was a lifetime membership kit...Don't order this magazine unless you like junk mail.
1,Not happy,This car was much smaller than expected and fell a part quite fast. Definitely would not recommend this to anyone.
5,Two thumbs up!,I liked it very much! It made me shed a few tears. I enjoy good subtitled movies. This is one. I thought the plot was interesting and the characters were also interesting.
1,Did we see the same movie?,"This movie is MUCH worse than the other reviews say it is. It is so stupid and so phony and so irritating - and the music is so annoying and overbearing - that I wanted to start screaming and write my OWN suicide note just to get away from it.Maybe you have to be Japanese or a ten year old girl to appreciate it, but whatever it takes I don't have. I hated it."
1,Maybe you have to be Japanese,One of the stupidest movies I have ever watched. I could not finish watching it. This is the 21st century. This film sets gay people back 50 years.
4,Envious love vs Everlasting love,The movie was much too slow in the beggining but the pace picked up towards the midpoint of the movie. The final heartbreak results in a devine intervention.
4,"Simply stated, easy to read.","I originally borrowed this book from a friend, read it in one sitting and returned it, knowing I would need to read it many times. It deals with the kind of concepts that are easy to agree with but complex to absorb into the human nature with an understanding. Her writing style is lovely and relaxing."
1,Stinkingly Useless,"A collection of tepid ""story ideas"" seemingly culled from back issues of TV Guide, and inane snippets of ""dialogue."" Perfect for old divorcees in creative writing classes getting in touch with themselves... wait, nah, I was just trying to be mean--even they'd hate this nonsense. My apologies to old divorcees.Stay away! This is a con to take your money. If you need writing ideas, you're better off sticking your head underwater or looking around your cell--that's what these people did."
5,Excellent and best,This is the most excellent analysis and explanation of an esoteric and important Buddhist text. It is better than any similar analysis and explanation I have ever read about any other sutra or other such document.
3,"Small, but inferior to Oxford Pocket Slownik Kieszonkowy","This smallest English-Polish and Polish-English dictionary is like Belitz Polish Pocket Dictionary, fits into a small pocket, and is smaller than, but inferior to Oxford Pocket Slownik Kieszonkowy. It is not modern. The letters (type) are quite big, clear, printed well, and legible. Each page contains 2 columns with 40 lines each. That is less than a half of text per page of Oxford Pocket Slownik Kieszonkowy."
3,Be Aware It Is Only Six Episodes,"When I purchased Vol 1-3 I didn't realize that it was only 6 episodes. I was disappointed because for that much money I expected more. That said, it was the full show with some extra stuff, it was good quality and fun to watch. I would recommend these DVD's to anyone that feels it's worth it to pay $10 an episode."
4,"Good/Funny, but a little high priced.","DVD is classic and funny. However, it only consists of two shows, which in my opinion makes the DVD price too high."
3,"good instrumentals, but...","The instumental work on this recording is very strong. ""Jin-Go-Lo-Ba"", ""Puesta Del Sol"", and ""El Corzon Manda"" are lengthy instrumentals with some great percussion, drums, organ and guitar work. ""Puesta..."" sounds suspiciously like a re-working of ""Fried Neckbones."" The problem for me is Rolie's vocals. While ""As the Years Go Passing By"" is just ok, Rolie's vocals on ""Persuasion"" are both weak and off-key. Too bad. Otherwise, this album gets 4 stars.This is a good look at the original Santana band in their formative years. And thank God Rolie found his voice!"
5,Love this gospel album,"Rev. Evans sings so well, if you close your eyes, it would seem like he was standing in front of you singing. I love his songs. Will add to my collection."
5,I had my doubts ...,"I've mixed emotions about other wipes in similar contaiers. They are dried out by the time I open the package or before I'm finished with the task at hand. Not so with these cook-top wipes! I have used Weiman's liquid cleaner but that takes time and elbow grease. I popped the first wipe out of the container and it was plenty wet! I swipped it across the stove top several times and, to my dismay, a stain from a spill-over that had already been cleaned almost disappeared! I folded the wipe in quarters and continued to gently wipe the surface. It continued to pick up residue and left the top looking like new!"
2,Overpriced Windex Wipes,"Purchased this based on the prior 5 star reviews and was very surprised when we received wipes that are all but identical to Windex Wipes and work just as poorly on our cook top. The product says that it ""Removes grease, fats and burnt on water residue"" and leaves ""ranges with a brilliant, streak-free shine after every use"" we found that these claims are simply not true. I plan on returning these wipes and will instead useWeiman Glass Cook Top Heavy Duty Cleaner and Polishwhich, while not as simple, does what it is supposed to."
4,similiar,This dvd collection is very much like all her other dvd's. It would be nice to explore some new movements and techniques.
4,Good Workout!,Works all the places you would think it should. Gets a little monotonous after awhile but that can be said of almost all video workouts.
2,Rene Furterer Okara Mild Silver Shampoo 5.07 oz. Shampoo Unisex,NOT ANY DIFFERENT OR BETTER THAN DRUG STORE ONE FOR MUCH LESS MONEY.IN COMPARISON WITH LESS EXPENSIVE PRODUCT LIKE CLAIROL OR NEXIS.
1,Lacked a good ending,I liked the book. I got lost in the long descriptions of places or feelings. It was moving along well toward the end then it just stopped. Nothing. I hurried home to finish the last 2 chapters. I was disappointed.
2,A Self-Righteouse Snooze Fest,"I began reading ""A Little Love Story..."" (and little is what you get) believing the protagonist, Jake, to be around 60 with those dorky opinions of his. When I learned he was only 30, I was completely turned off to Jake and the story, an unrealistic, sappy tale with an ""I'm holier-than-thou"" vibe that is numbing. It only got worse from there.Dull and cliched, the plot plods along, but although it's a sad story, you can't get anything up for it except for a snicker here or there. There's nothing worse than obviousness and false sentimentality in writing. The worst of it is that the author continuously interjects his trite opinions about the world, such as this gem, ""I don't like aggressive people."" Ugh.What really put the kabbash on it for me was the whole 9/11 tired subplot with the ex-girlfriend. I mean, geez, that's as low as you can get in tugging at the heartstrings.As a female, I say this with pleasure. I'd rather read Charles Butkowski any day!"
2,A Little Love Story,"I have read all of Merullo's books love the fact it was written in Massachusetts and about here. He uses all the elements of mystery, love and hope we all love to read about. I always check to see if he has new books out."
5,a love story for grownups,"I read this in two sittings and found it difficult to put down. The protagonist, Jake Entwhistle, a carpenter-artist, is on the outs with mainstream American society in the way that most sane people are these days, and his voice is full of charm, humor, whimsy, decency and wisdom. His love affair with Janet, who is dying of CF, is a beautifully sustained pas de deux between two people committed to ""brutal honesty,"" and grasping every sweetness they can as they come face to face with the mortality that awaits us all. The book is tough, funny, likeable and wise. Though it deals with 9/11 in a somewhat glancing way, it's one of the first accounts to do so with an emotional maturity that feels digested and of a size and quality appropriate to the aubject matter. The story is also an utterly compelling read. One of the best books of the year."
4,As You Might Guess,"it is a love story. Jake and Janet meet when she backs her car into his pickup truck at a doughnut shop. Janet has cystic fibrosis and her health is deteriorating rapidly. Jake, a carpenter and an artist, is determined to do all he can for her. Despite the difficulty of the subjects, it is often quite funny. There is a scene where Jake wrestles, in anger, with the governor of Massachusetts, which is not something you see all the time. The story is told with compassion and generosity and the characters are fully realized. We see good people do bad things and bad people do good things, just like every day life. The novel is wise, heartfelt and entertaining. Everything you'd want when you buy a book."
2,Don't bother,"The idea is a good one, just the execution was lame. Inner monologging got old and tired. And without giving away the ending, I'll just say it was HIGHLY improbable that things would work out the way they did. I can't say anything more for fear of spoilers, but it was just a bit too tidy and convenient. A little checking of statistics and hospital policy on the author's part would have made a world of difference."
2,Needless melodrama and self-conscious quirkiness,"This book is boring. The characters feel like flat stereotypes, with quirkiness filling in for any real depth or warmth. I plowed through to the unsatisfying end of the novel, without coming to care about anyone in the story."
3,After-School TV Movie,"Merullo does a nice job of writing a romance that a man can enjoy, but the disease-of-the-week setting for this story sucks much of the pleasure out of it.John Entwhistle falls in love with Janet, and they have enough in common with each other that they quickly realize they could come to love each other. Janet has cystic fibrosis; and as the romance between John and Janet deepens, so does her disease worsen. How both of these characters will cope with the joys of discovering true love under such tragic circumstances is the thrust of this novel.Mr. Merullo writes confidently and cleverly, and his characters get time to live and breathe before this short novel comes to its inconclusive conclusion. Merullo seems to be plugging for John Hiatt, since that rock n' roller's music is brought up a few times for no special reason. Not a bad novel, but nothing here is so good that it makes me think of Tim Farrington."
4,"A Little Love Story it is, nice story, not a block buster","Nice story, well written. I learned a lot about Cystic Fibrosis. Not a nice disease. But also a lot about love and friendship. I really like Roland Merullo's writing.Loved Breakfast with Buddah and several others. I am moving on to another one of his books."
4,Passover Haggadah,"Didn't expect it to be the large format version, but very happy with it.Will be very useful for sharing."
5,Makes a hard task much easier,"The further I go with learning french, the more I realise the importance of mastering french verbs. This book starts with the best summary of verbs and tenses that I know of, and then provides a full conjugation of the 250 most useful french verbs. What's really handy is the way the book identifies the major families of verbs and their patterns. Highly recommended."
3,French verb book,This gives a very good description of french verbs and their conjugates which can be found in similar books. It is still good for referencing and understanding french verbs
1,Horrible!,Ink smeared and it was tacky! Waited too long to use it and missed my return date. Now I'm stuck with something I can't use. Should have not tried to save some money and bought the brand name . . . Lesson learned.
5,Thumbs Up!,"I love this accessory, its a great sign, and it transforms such a tidious chore to a happy, laughable enviroment."
2,No End To The Story!,"I wish I had read the previous reviews before buying this DVD! What a shock. My ""Belinda"" came with 4 DVD's, 16 hrs of story. I loved it n thought it was well edited but started getting suspicious that something was wrong while watching DVD # 4. I wondered how the rest of the story would be abbreviated in one last DVD!.....well....the producers of this DVD solved the problem by cheating the consumer....there is NO END to the story. It leaves u wondering what happened to all the different characters in the story. What an incredible rip-off. How is it possible that ""TV Azteca"", ""Image Entertainment"" & ""Cinevision International"" the producers of this DVD get away with it? This came out in 2006 n it should be re-called or they should put out a ""Belinda- Part # 2""!I'm angry as can be! DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! :-("
1,hope there would be a sequel to this film!!!!,"Sadly I haven't read the many reviews stating that there was no end to it!!! how disappointing!!! I just hope that they would make a second or third season out it otherwise it would be really poor...I suggest to write directly to the company which has edited this film.Very, extremely poor..."
1,Rip off! Movie has no last chapter,"I agree with all the previous reviewers. The movie is a rip off. Chapter 17 and 18 (this being the last one) are the same, so you do not see the ending. This is a real disappointment. Ask a bit more so that you can pay attention to the quality of your product. This definitely does not endear your customers to you."
3,An Interesting Redo Of BCR Tunes,"This CD is a remake of a number of BCR tunes done by three of the original band members - Eric Faulkner, Stuart Wood and Alan Longmuir. Most of the tunes feature Eric Faulkner on lead vocals. Alan Longmuir offers his version of Keep on Dancin' which seems appropriate as he was there in 71' when the Rollers hit the charts for the first time with this tune (Faulkner and Wood joined the band later leading to their worldwide conquest in 74'). Stuart Wood, while being a very talented musician provides a good effort albeit vocally weak versions of ""Give a Litte Love"" and ""You Made Me Believe in Magic"". A nice offering is ""Love Me Like I Love You"" which wasn't included on their previous studio offerings despite it being a hit. While clearly not their best effort, it should find a place for those looking to keep their BCR collections complete."
3,different from the original group,"When I bought this CD I wasn't expecting it to sound like the original because Les wasn't lead vocals, but if your a true roller fan you would want this for your collection."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"Like the other reviewrer, I was very disappointed with the CD, and I also got suckered into buy this thinking it was the original songs. This CD is a remake and the songs are awlful."
1,Dust Bunnies - not what I thought - Dust is right,"The person who sung ""Happy Together"" and ""Elenore"", I was really surprised - I didn't like the music, not even the singing. I was thinking this can't be the same person. Dust Bunnies is an appropriate title, except the word bunnies - this is a CD that will be collecting--dust."
2,Such big hopes,"I really have enjoyed the Capitol Steps past recordings. Maybe Bush and the current situation just aren't funny... Very disappointing, but can't win them all. Naturally, some of the Taliban and Osama humor seems a little stale now - however the Tom Ridge and Trent Lott pieces are very telling of the current situation."
1,Unimpressive book on the philosophy of science.,"This book will confuse more than inform. The book attempts to summarize developments in the philosophy of science from the days of classical physics through quantum mechanics in the 20th Century. However, because of the author's poor writing style and explanatory power, many of the ideas become muddled. The reader would be much better off using this book as a bibliography and going directly to the sources. For example, read the original Popper, Kuhn, Feyerabend, etc. Finally, the softcopy version of the book eventually fell to pieces due to the poor binding job. Not recommended."
3,Recommended textbook,"I recommend this textbook on the philosophy of science (and I thus disagree with the anonymous review by ""A reader from Baltimore, Maryland"", and I do not find anonymous reviews helpful).It is translated to many languages and fulfils a great need for a textbook. In shorter courses it is not possible to read all the original works and it is better to have a short presentation of Thomas Kuhn along with a presentation of the discussion of and further development of his work. Chapter 3 on the theory dependence of observation is especially important. I have used this text in courses and found it useful, although some of the final chapters are somewhat unclear. I can think of no other book, which can replace this one for a shorter course in the philosophy of science for undergraduates in fields outside philosophy itself. (Compare my review of Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy)."
3,Just so-so,"I was shocked when I opened a can of this and saw what it looked like. It is VERY dry in the can. Of course I was stuck with 6 cans so I've been using it to add to homemade soups and it works fine for that. I never did eat it as a bowl of corn chowder. So it is edible but it is way over priced and if I had only bought one can, I would never have bought more."
3,The Early Days,"This book is a first person account of Terry Wendt's struggles in Nashville as a struggling musician (pedal steel guitarist). It should be read my anyone aspiring to be a musician in Nashville as it covers life on the road as well as touching on studio work. As well as the professional struggles the book also chronicles the battles that the author endured on a personal level and details battles with the ""powers that be"" in an attempt to get an independently produced song distributed.After reading the book (2 1/2 hours) I was emotionally drained and glad that I had chosen a different path."
5,Classic,Very good 80's movie.Makes you laugh and cringe all at the same time.Very great buy and I am very pleased with my purchase and the film.
2,"Decent Movie, No Motive","Really would have been nice to know why the psycho killer was psycho killing. For instance, was that his daughter or sister who killed herself the year before because she did not get accepted into a fraternity? And by the way, who really cares? Now if her boyfriend , whom she worshiped had dumped her because she was not a member of a female sibling fraternity and he has to stay in his father and gf fraternity, now that would have been a motive for the killer after she killed herself. Recognizing that this is a late 70s to early 80s film, it wasn't that bad. For Jason's first few sequels his motive was that he did not want anyone at Camp Crystal Lake. Michael Myers was hunting his sister and his neice that, in H2o , turned into a nephew. Freddy Kruger was after the children of the town that killed him when he was human. Your movie can be silly, but it has got to have a motive."
2,FINAL EXAM SCORES AN F,"I am a huge slasher fan and i couldnt wait to get this movie, i love most slashers from the heydey of 1978-83. i anxiously laid down my cash and took this movie home i popped it in the player only to be heavily dissapointed, there is no blood and the killer is not scary he also is revealed during the whole thing , dont get me wrong you dont need blood to make a good slasher Black christmas for example, this is no Black christmas, the only reason i give it 2 stars is the fact somebody thinks this is classic 2 stars for building an undeserved reputation."
3,my hometown,"hello, this movie is decent , for an 80s horror. the reason i like it so much , is that it was filmed in my hometown of Gaffney , SC . at Limestone Collage. also the hometown of actress Andie Macdowell."
2,Kinky!!,"I ordered this tubing for a pond pump and spitter, luckily I only needed about 7' because much of this tubing was kinked badly."
4,It Was Worth The Money,"This is a good air filter. It does the job of cleaning the air so you can breath. I live in a basement. There's water damage and clothes left there. So it was real hard to breath. I also didn't know if the air had mildew, or other living organisms.I woke up with bad headaches or a stopped up nose. Some times I would just be sick with cold type symtoms.The reviews on this item were 21 out of 22 (good) on one site and the same kind of thing on others. I used chatt window customer service with a site that sells air filters. They recommended a $500-600 filter. The reviews on it were not even close to this one.I decided to go back give it a try. I got the same results as they did. I can breath. I'm not stopped up or sick every day. I trust the air I breath. Its worth the money."
2,War and Peace this is not,"It seems to have become popular to compare this book to War and Peace, but the difference between the two is night and day. War and Peace reads effortlessly, while Generations of Winter is clunky at best. Tolstoy can breathe more life into a character in a single line than Aksyonov managed in his entire book. Yes, both are epics, but War and Peace this is clearly not."
2,Warmed-over Tolstoy,"This book purports to be a 20th century analog of War & Peace. Unfortunately the author transposes entire scenes from Tolstoy's novel. Characters are one-dimensional, wearing labels such as ""Decent Citizen Doctor,"" ""Starry-Eyed Young Jewish Communist"" or ""Cynical Careerist"".The translation is goofy. No doubt jocular or slang terms for any manner of things sound just fine in the Russian, but using slang for the same word in English often sounds risible. Thus food is usually referred to as ""grub,"" clothes as ""duds,"" and so on.Then there are the downright errors. Polish names for example are grossly misspelled; names of major streets in Warsaw are chewed up and spit out as names for non-existent neighborhoods.Stalin and Beria were bad men and their purges were terrible events. That doesn't mean you've got to write bad books about them."
1,CHAPTER ONE!!!!!!,"Sometimes people take verses out of context to make their point. Others misinterpret the meaning (whether intentionally or not) and apply verses to situations that the originaly writer did not intend for it to be applied to. Very rarely does an author have the nerve to actually change the actually text of a Bible verse to support their statements.But these authors did it in the very first chapter. And in the rest of the book they go on and commit the other errors mentioned above.I do not dispute that this book may be an inspiration to some people, and I do not dispute much of what the authors are trying to say in this book. However, this is not the method by which I chose to learn or be inspired."
5,Life Changing Book,"This book is one that displays the power of God, and shows that He does indeed supply for His work. This is a story of a man who rejected God and went His own way and whom God was determined to use for His Kingdom. It is a story of the suffering church, and the suppression of the church in countries behind the iron curtain. It is very moving to hear about how so many have a limited access to the Word of God, and who have never heard the Good News of God. If you are looking for book that will change your life and the way you view God and His work, then, although I can make no guarantees, I would most definitely recommend this book."
5,A Meaningful Autobiography of Faith,"This is one of my favorite audio books but it is hard to put in words its very special qualities. The narrator is wonderful in giving a soft and moving portrait of a man who become transformed from a soldier who kills others into a Man of God who would sacrifice all he had to help a person worse off than himself. We witness the personal evolution of a radiant soul...and even a nonbeliever can be impressed. I liked the part that in his training, he was NOT allowed to pass the collection plate but hadto depend on the goodwill of those he healed with his faith.The details make the book special. Some examples: the friendship of Andrew with a monkey that he buys in Indonesia during his soldiering days; a letter he writes in utter loneliness to his girlfriend; finding a shilling that he turns over to another.For the right person, this is a wonderful book for a present."
3,It's still Spalding,"I had the opportunity to see this work performed by Spalding Gray at UCLA and I must say that some of the grit and edge in Gray's earlier monologues was no longer present.However, I am always amazed at Gray's ability to tell simple stories and I remain in awe at his facile use of language and description.A true artist evolves over time, so even if I don't enjoy the kinder, gentler Spalding as much, I must still respect him for for what he is--one of the greatest monologue-ists out there..."
2,Where has Spalding Gray gone?,"Domesticity may make him happy, but it sure doesn't do much for his monologuing. This, alone among all his monologues, is flat, rather boring. There's something to be said for transgression, at least as a topic for art."
1,More of the same,"Hip America's favorite self-indugent whiner suddenly discovers, as he approaches 60, that other people in the world exist.But he's still essentially a self-absorbed whiner, and his pepetual adolescence pose has worn thin."
5,Great Selection,"You need SOME experience, but you do not need to be an expert as you may think by the title. I recomend buy ""Royal Road to Card Magic"" and this book together. ""Royal Road to Card Magic"" gives you some basics and this book will fine tune your skills. It gives you a great variety of slieghts. Take the palm for example, there are 14 versions of it. I can't say enough about this book. If you are even considering card magic, BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,So difficult!,"Assumes a level of card expertise far beyond what even experienced conjurers would have; even worse, the language and organization is so difficult to penetrate."
3,Okay product....,Simple design like the fastners and works fine just like the description says..... Would buy other products from this company again. Like the color.
2,Disappointment,"I received the book with page 85 torn. i know it's a bargain book but i didn't expect this. First disappointment. The tour is limited to Europe and US. Second disappointment. Here, in Mauritius, we are opened to the world sharing different cultures. European, Chinese, Indian and regional (Indian Ocean) cuisines are not unknown to us."
1,It sucks!,I hate this phone! If you're in the USA and thinking about getting this phone then keep looking because all you can do with it is talk and text. NO companies support the features that you pay for..not even Nokia can help with sending updates. It's a cute phone and unique..not as pink as the pic makes it out to be though...I really hate mine but that's just me!
1,"Avoid, not progressive rock , but a sub-par boring pop album","Released in 1994, containing songs that were supposed to come out in the late 1970's when they were considered to have lost it, or pressured into writing song with new wave pop influence in order to sell records.These would have be considered tracks too lousy to make it then.In 1994 there are tired renditions of them by a band that seemed to be making a record to support themselves and their family."
1,There is no progressive music here!,I like early Caravan's albums. But this CD is not CARAVAN that I like. It contains some of popish music. I don't know why it was issued... One star! Sorry...
4,"Fun, funny, whimsical, thoughtful","I first heard this album as a graduate student (Deli song - ""Where you from? Madison, Wisconsin"")and immediately ran out to find it. I couldn't find it then, but taped it off a radio station that broadcast albums in their entirety, complete with DJ comments, and have carried it around for twenty years, always checking record stores in the faint hope of finding it. I was so happy to find it re-released on CD. The songs run the gamut of sad, happy, funny, whistful, and thoughtful, but all extremely enjoyable. Buy the CD while its still available. You'll listen to it often, for at least the next twenty years."
4,"Bacco Bucci Men's Belfour Lace-up, Black, 16 M","Great shoes, very stylish. Need to slowly wear them in, I wore them for 7 hours and my feet were sore. Other then that I got a lot of compliments. Its hard to find such nice shoes for my size and at such a good price."
3,psychedelic & silly.,"These are those 'Venus"" people. I can barely understand her voice, but that's the fun of it. Does this one have ""Black Butter"" on it? no, maybe this is the ""Love Buzz"" one."
3,Give me 20 years and I'll tell you,This ratchet is to replace a 20 year old Husky that was mighty strong and reliable. I understand now that Stanley owns Husky - only time will tell if it's as good.
2,Flea Market Fidos: The Dish on Dog Junk & Canine Collectibles,"This book explored the 'types' of canine collectibles one might find in the marketplace, but it didn't address the 'value' of these collectibles, which would have been much more insightful. The content was purely fluff with little substance to offer a true collector."
4,good mic,"it was inexpensive, it sounds fine, it's not very flexible (a couple of inches variability), nor does the flexible start stay right exactly where you position it-- and that's its only problem !"
2,"Right size, wrong quality","I ordered this because it seemed like a cheap solution to adding a mic to my DJ rig. Problem is, the audio quality is terrible. I know have a mic just sitting in my room, not plugged into my mixer, because after using it once I didn't want to use it again on the internet radio show I broadcast for. It was practical to add to the mixer, but quality was just lacking.Form factor great. Audio quality bad."
1,usless in baja california,"This may be better in the big cities but it is usless in baja. It is missing highways, and does not even have san felipe."
4,The best mapping I have found for Mexico,"I will completely agree with the other reviewers about the shortcomings of this map SD. However, I really like it and find it very valuable. There is good street information for the larger cities, and it is very helpful to know where one is and what direction one is going. I find it much more useful than any of my paper maps. Mexico City is much less terrifying with this map."
2,Mexico Maps,Not worth the money - very little of Mexico covered and what is there is very limited.Don't waste your money - wait till they come up with something better. This one is not even upgradeable.
5,The quintessential Fuzztones - a psychadelic masterpiece,"This is the classic Fuzztones album from the early incarnation of the band. Featuring unbeatable original songs and covers that are better than the original recordings. The energy and production are so strong - I daresay, *relentless* - this album will knock your socks (and maybe a few other things) right off!"
5,The Fuzztones are one of the most under rated bands EVER!!!!,"I feel that the Fuzztones,are easily one of the most under rated bands ever. Lysergic Emanations is desert island music for sure. Plus the cover art is exectional! Can you say, ""I LOVE THIS BAND!""? I can!"
3,Not Much Beyond the Title,The book has good intentions but it leaves you wanting more. A decent book that glosses over male topics but never really gives you the details that I have come to expect from other books.
2,Form vs Content,"A great looking book, which however fails to follow through by providing equally good content. Too often specifics are passed over in favour of vague generalities."
3,"Breezy, informative text with first rate photographs.","Excellent presentation. Unlike many publications of this type that appear intimidating, this book is jam packed with non judgemental insights."
4,"Finally, the ""Spend My Life With You"" remix!","The best thing about this CD single is that you can now FINALLY get the remix of Eric Benet's ""Spend My Life With You"", which previously you could only hear on the radio. That alone makes it worth the price."
1,Spend My Life With You,"Actually i haven't listened to this cd Although i have been encourged to buy it,because i have been looking for the re-mix of ""Spend My Life with You"". Doe's anyone know if the Re-mix is on this cd? If so please e-mail me at rburgos@auntanns.com"
4,How trance is suppose to be!,This CD is one of the few that pulls off excellent trance mixes. Most trance today has been lacking what this cd has. D-Love did a great job with the mixes and the selection of songs. It's an all around great cd for anyone loving electronica. This cd defenitely raises the bar for the trance genre!
1,"Sugar, Sugar","Sugar, Sugar is the only song on the whole CD which is GREAT. The Other songs sound like [garbage]!!!!!!"
3,"Decent Quality, but...","There are better collections out there but it's good to hear ""Time For Love"" on this one. At least until the 'official' release comes out."
2,bubble gum,its been hard to get my hands on the most sweetest of the sweet bubble gum songs of all time SUGAR SUGAR. so i bit the bullet and bought the greatest hits. or should i say greatest hit? its really pretty bad. the other songs are just not good. which makes the remastering kind of funny. why? anyway...
5,"If you like the archies, you'll love this CD!","Archie, Reggie, Veronica,Betty, and Jughead...in a group together-what could be better? If you like the Archies, you'll LOVE this CD!! I have read the Archies for years, and it's exciting to hear them. This CD is worth every penny-believe me."
4,Great Flatware,This is great flatware that has a nice quality feel. I would say it is on the heavy side which I like. It is very pretty and washes up nicely in the dishwasher. I would recommend this brand.
2,Yet another punk live album,"First off, I love G.B.H., or should I say that I loveD G.B.H.? The older they get in age, the older they sound on record, and this document of a live show proves this theory well. Besides some pretty muddy sound, the band sounds tired and bored with performing ""City Baby"" for the thousandth time. There's really no need for this CD unless you're collecting G.B.H. material and have to have everything. Buy an old album and hear them when they still had some energy. Avoid."
5,A Fascinating Career,"When I thought of Robert Altman before reading this book, I typically thought of him as a ""Seventies"" director who had had a few hits in recent years.This book shows how limited that view of Altman was. It is a wide-ranging interview that covers Altman's career from his stint as an extra in ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (!!!) to directing ""The Company."" He talks about his involvement with the classic TV series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""Combat"" as well as directing Broadway plays and a couple operas.And, of course, he talks about his films, the classics that everyone remembers and those that got buried by the critics. From it all, Altman emerges as a fascinating character who pursued his own vision and took advantage of changes in the media to be relatively successful.Essential reading for anyone interested in recent American film."
2,Live Cooper from 1969 -- But not all it appears to be.,"This is a Bootleg release which has been issued under a number of diferent titles, i.e. Ladies Man, Toronto Rock'N'Roll Revival '69, Freak Out Song and I believe one or two others.The first two tracks, ""Going to the River"" and ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman"" aren't even Alice Cooper tracks. There has been considerable debate about who actually performed those numbers at the festival, but one thing is known for sure, it WASN'T Alice Cooper. The rest are very early Alice Cooper recordings which were to eventually appear on Pretties For You and Easy Action. I believe that a number of the tracks were originally done by the Spiders and/or the Nazz, Alice Coopers early group names. It is certainly not the best of his work but nonetheless worth having if you're a Cooper collector or at all interested in the beginnings of the Alice Cooper experience."
1,Is this even Cooper? It's so LAME!,Alice Cooper is brilliant but not here! This must be his lame days b/f his band got their 'sound'. Try anything else but this.
1,Marc Butler - Alice Fan for Life!!!!,"I've been a die hard Alice Fan for years...I cherished his great albums like Billion Dollar Babies and Welcome to my Nightmare, Head Banged to Raise Your Fist & Constrictor and forgiven him for his jump into the glam world (his glam albums are still great!!!) However this one is without a doubt the worst album I;ve ever heard!! The songs have no rythm let alone reason, simply put it's painful to even listen to it! Save your money and your sanity and buy his classics...this one should be buried in an unmarked grave!!! P.S. Be careful, this album is out there under different titles...if you look at the traks and see Nobody likes it.... drop it and...RUN!!!!"
1,A total bore...,"Alice Cooper is one of my favorite artists of all time, but even I cannot stand to listen to this droning album of garbage. None of the songs have any memorable hooks or lyrics as in most of Alice's other recordings; in fact,the first two songs on this album don't even sound like they were sung by Alice Cooper. My advice to all Alice fans out there thinking about purchasing this CD--save your money, and buy any one of his other albums. ""Freak Out Song"" is just an embarrassment to us all."
2,You get what you pay for.....,"I bought this pan to evaluate Rachel Ray's line. Well it is NOT a value priced LeCrueset! It is light; (I have a Lodge fajita pan also) and I cannot imagine it surviving intact and looking good to pass on to my daughter, etc as it scratched the first time it was (gently) used. I also agree that it sticks like crazy! I believe the enamel coat needs to be thicker, or of a better quality. The plus side of this is that I spent $20.00 and got free shipping. Sorry, I cannot recommend this brand for an enameled cast iron investment. Good only if you hate all other types of cookware and cannot afford any of the better brands!"
3,Pretty cast-iron pan,"The pan is pretty. It does heat evenly. But as everyone says, food sticks to it. And as long as I've ever used any porcelain cookware, I've never known it to have nonstick qualities. So, my expectations were realistic. However, the advertisements do say, ""no need to season [the pan]"" which makes you think, it will be somewhat nonstick. I think the best way to use it is to keep the heat at medium. Heat first, then add oil, then whatever you're cooking. I made an omelet (I know it's not meant for that) in it this morning. And it only stuck a little to the sides. For clean up, I recommend coating the bottom with water and letting it heat on the stove to a simmer for about 10-15 minutes or so. You'll find the cooked on stuff will scrape off easily. You can do this with any cookware. I'll continue to use it because I'm trying to use healthier alternatives to teflon."
3,disappointed buyer,"I bought this book without going to a bookstore to preview it. The only reason I wanted the book was for the peanut butter glasses on the cover. Only after searching through the book did I check inside the cover to find out that the Big Top peanut butter water tumblers were not featured in this book. I felt this was very deceiving of the author and although there are a lot of pictures of glassware, those pictures can be found in many other books."
3,Beautiful pictures!,"I definately appreciate the beautiful color pictures. However I'm new to glass collecting and I wanted something that would help me to identify the ages and manufacturers better. This will definately help me to choose me preferred pattern, but I might have to pick up another book to help with the actual identifications."
5,"Fabulous photography, histories, and general information.","I have absolutely fallen in love with Anchor Hocking's Fire King pieces, so I bought this book as a reference guide to begin my collection. I looked through about 8 books on glassware, but this is the ONLY one that had the best pictures and information. I did also buy another book by Gene Florence (mostly for a slightly different range in pricing), but this is the one that I keep going back to for reference. I am amazed at the number of pieces shown, and in color, which is extremely helpful for any new collector. I would recommend this book, as well as his Fire King book (minus the errors I keep hearing about!) to anyone who wants a couple of well-rounded guides to finding Fire King pieces."
5,Just awesome picture and sound,"Bought this TV a month ago and the picture is just awesome when connected to a HD-841 DVD player (HDTV Samsumg DVD player) which I got free too from best buy for buying TV online. Sound is great too. It just feels like watching in a new theater.Couple of times I saw the entire picture turning red when the TV was turned on. But if I swith it off and turn back on, it will was ok. Don't know if it is a defect in either case don't really need to worry since I bought the 4-yr extended warranty from best buy."
2,Functions well when it functions at all,"While I like the picture, sound and features, within 1 year the TV ceased to work. The warranty repair involved replacing nearly everything, and took nearly 2 weeks. I wasn't particularly happy dealing with Samsung service. Although I ultimately got a functioning TV back, I still deal with intermittent problems getting the TV to start. This is accompanied by apparently diagnostic sequences of flashing lights on the front. Unfortunately, the Samsung web site is not helpful decoding those lights, and I'm not interested in talking with their unpleasant support folks. I just wait for the day the thing refuses to start, at which point I'll be done with my Samsung experiment. Not recommended."
1,"Low Quality Products, poor after market service!","From the moment i opened the box it was trouble, the screen had marks on it, then motherboard needed to be replaced and then another picture problem occurred finally Samsung gave up and replaced it. Dealing with Samsung customer service is probably the worst in the business, i have had a better experience at the DMV (no joke). After over 30 calls to Samsung, being constantly lied to and them never calling me back they finally replaced the TV, however this took over 2 months. A year later the color wheel broke and now i am in Samsung hell, with the customer service department. It's now been a month and they still haven't managed to call me back, for my sanity I have now given up and decided to pay for the repairs for myself. Don't buy Samsung, the products are unreliable and the after market service is diabolical."
5,greattt,"Bought this tv as an open box at Best Buy for $1,799.00, used the Rewards Zone to get points and got $60 in gift certificates, was able to finance for 18 months no interest. The only thing missing was the manual and I emailed Samsung and they emailed it to me 2 days later!! (now I see that another version is available here in Amazon) What a response talk about service!!The tv is plain awesome, highly recommend it, great product!"
5,Guiliani,I heard this on my way to a wedding 2009 and feel in love. I was headed for the Tampa area and could not get out of the car when I reached my destination. I had to listen and wait to hear the title and the composer etc. I immediately called thwe station to find out the othe r info and scored when I google it and found the cd. Pure joy in the ears.
3,Slightly outdated,"This book is quite helpful for the beginning Mac programmer.However, lots of things have changed since it was published.When you try to follow the ""Try it out"" examples, sometimes you get seriously stuck, because the ""buttons"" you are suggested to click no longer exist in the new versions of Xcode and Interface Builder.Some discussed functions are now depreciated.It's the time for the authors to think about a new edition."
4,nice book,"I've just started to read the book (1st &2nd chapters) and it seems to follow the directions from previous reviews that lead me to buy it: it seems indicated to someone who, like me, is new to the OSX environment and is willing to do some programming on it."
4,easy action,"great cd from john brannon of touch and go old band ""laughing hyenas""!straight up rock and roll."
4,good game,"I Love this game, it was my first WW2 game and I still play it now. The online multiplayer is awsome, and the story isnt much different from all the other MOH games. The only bad thing was that the middle levels are harder than the last ones, a level called ""snipers last stand"" is probably the hardest level.The guns are ok and the levels are fun. but not alot of vehicles to drive around."
3,Impossible Riddim 2001. . .,"This track is apparently very hard to ride: Wyclef, Capleton, Wayne Marshall, Elephant Man, Wayne Wonder, Lexxus, Kiprich, Stranger, even Mad Cobra, Mega Banton, General B, Boom Dandimite and even Bounty's prodigy Vibez Cartel all have a pretty hard time riding this track. The only 3 who do it well is Bounty, of course with a great war tune ""I am Who I Am"", Sean Paul who can ride anything and does it well on ""Baby Don't Yuh Worry"", and Beenie on Hands Up Deh, even though this doesn't sound like the type of riddim Beenie would excel on. Overall, I don't think that you can find Beenie's and Sean Paul's tracks on any other cd, so if you're a fan of both you may wanna pick this one up, otherwise, get Greensleeves Ragga Dancehall Anthem 2001 album for Bounty Killer's hit.Ps. the riddim itself is excellent"
1,styrofoam,"I'm not sure what my expectations were going in, but this wouldn't have lived up to them. It tastes like a cross between styrofoam and the marshmallows found in Lucky Charms cereal.I was looking for something to take along on 5-day mountain climbing trips, but I think I'll stick to the old standards from here on out.Might be okay as a one-time novelty for pre-teen kids, but it isn't something you'd want for a serious after-meal snack on a semi-regular basis."
2,Like Marshmallow Cereal?,"If you like Lucky Charms cereal, this'll float your boat. The freeze-dried ice cream has the same consistency, particularly in terms of crunchiness. The dessert will get stuck throughout your teeth, allowing you to horrify your friends and save some flavor for later.You only get a single ice cream sandwich in a bag, which makes the whole thing seem overpriced and over-packaged."
2,I can't believe they did this to great music!!!,"Granted, the band and songs are great. So then why did they cut ""Who are you"" and ""Won't get fooled again"". Yes, both of these songs were cut, the entire song is not played on this CD. As a huge Who fan, I must tell others not to buy this CD, because you are missing out on two great songs."
3,Track List,1. Substitute2. The Seeker3. Magic Bus4. My Generation5. Pinball Wizard6. Happy Jack7. Won't Get Fooled Again8. My Wife9. Squeeze Box10. The Relay11. 5:1512. Love Reign O'er Me13. Who Are You
4,"Not bad, there are better though","Not the best collection of Who songs but still not bad. It has most of the hits but is lacking a few major ones. It also features some lesser known yet great songs such as ""Relay"" and ""My Wife"". However, you would be better off buying one of the more thorough compilations."
3,how can this be?,"How can this be a Greatest Hits album by The Who, if it includes the glaring omission of the single greatest song ever done by The Who, ""I Can See For Miles""? I really have to question the sanity of whomever put this compilation together, because this oversight defies any sense of logic whatsoever........................."
4,SYMPHONIC CACOPHONY,I tried on karaoke but it didn't work. This offering would be ten times as good without vocals. The brilliant music itself sings. His vocals screech and beg. I wish I could get it without the singing - the music itself sings enough.
2,Pretty crazy,A couple of good songs but the Beatles are far better I mean much better vocals harmony Guitars everything. Also the who were just plane out out of there mind. GodBless
3,unique and engaging but not quite achieved,"The room entales events before silent hill 2 i believe. The 1st person aspect has great, but needs more solid ground. The story behaves like it should and ties up loose ends about the killings fetured in the second silent hill. I'm not to fond of this one having ghosts that can't be killed or dispelled, which drops the replay value on this one. Controls handle well and the swing gauge is a great feature. this one seems short also.if they make another, why not incorporate the camera from resident evil 4 and keep the swing meter that may increase a stronger sense of emergency, while allowing precise aiming control of your guns. no one ever said james succeeded or failed. I think he needs to finish what he started."
2,Walk Smash Repeat,"This game has a great atmosphere, but thats it. I found it very repetative and dull. The HUD is a bit confusing and it just isn't practical. Walk around for 20 minutes, creepy music plays kill the monsters go back to you room for the next clue - Repeat - repeat repeat."
1,This game sucks!,"Boring, boring - be prepared to waste hours retracing your steps and running into dead ends. The pace is slow, the story is twisted, or non-existant. After playing it a few days I got stuck and spent a lot of time re-playing several scenes. You'll have more fun lighting your foot on fire. For a good sci-fi horror game, get Doom3. For a bad one, get this game - I'd be happy to give it to you."
3,Havent played yet but if it follows like the others in.....,"the series.....well then I will be screaming for my mommy on a second to second basis. I am so looking forward to it, and it's on XBOX! I have a PS2 but the graphics and sound will probably be better. The sounds I think are the most terrifying so if you have surround sound turn off the lights and turn it up! The monsters appear to be a little creepier than the last (although pyrimad (sp) head was super creepy) And the nurses who can forget the nurses. Since all the Silent Hill games were good I don't see why this one wouldn't be. So I will buy it and hopefully have a better review for you."
2,Silent Letdown,"If you're a fan of the first three SH games, save yourself some some pain and pretend that this game doesn't exist...especially if you can't find it for less that $10.00. The plot feels shoehorned into the Silent Hill universe, and you wouldn't be missing anything to just pass this game by. While this game has its (very brief) moments (for example, I genuinely cared about my next door neighbor...in a creepy ""looking at you through a hole in the wall"" kind of way), the gameplay falls flat, the levels are mostly crappy versions of areas from past SH games, your protagonist (who's name I can't even remember) isn't interesting at all, and about half of your enemies hurt you just by being in the same general vicinity as you...that's just cheap. Seriously, this game is a stinker...do yourself a favor and skip it."
1,Worst Game Ever?,"In my opinion, save your money. This is the worst game I have ever played in my life! What a joke."
5,A room full of nightmares...,"Now I got this game yesturday so I'm not very far yet but from what I have played this game kicks @$$. Right at the beginning it is kinda slow , you don't do alot but within a couple of minutes you should be fighting a bunch zombies/monsters and ""dogs"". Bad things about this game - the camera angle is sometimes a pain, it makes it hard to see emenies , and some might consider this a good thing some a bad thing ,but there is no auto aim when you are fighting, it actually requires some skill, not alot, but some.(I think it is a good thing , it makes the game more challenging). And pretty much everything else is good. Good sound , good graphics, I think it has a good concept (wierd but good). This game is definetly worth checking out."
5,Hot Chicks Get Naked! Again!,"Man, there are a ton of hot chicks in this thing. More then I've seen in all the porns I have. Get this thing. They all get naked! And you know what happens when hot college chicks get naked don't you. Well, If you do tell me, cause I want to know. This is something you must have!"
4,"There HOT, There very HOT","Dont get me wrong I love fresh naked woman dancing around. But I would prefer a little more action. The whole time watching it I was just waiting for something to happen, sometimes got half and half bored. These girls are hot, there naked and they are together. But they dont actually do anything together. If you are going to have a two girl scene at least let them excite each other. Or even if they are alone let them comfort themselves. This is the main thing lacking in this movie and it exactly what the people that buy these movies are looking for. They dont actually play with what we want them to and I have found this the same with other Penthouse and Playboy films"
5,The local's guide for visitors.,"This book, and the others in the series for Maui, Kauai and Hawaii, is indispensable for Hawaiian visitors and locals. It gives the best beaches for swimming, surfing, snorkeling and also critical safety information. Every year visitors drown because they don't know which beaches are safe and which aren't. This book covers every square inch of beach and coastal access. Also gives fascinating historical notes. As a frequent visitor for over 20 years, I still take mine with me on every trip!"
5,It's Not Just for Kids!,"My 24-year old son loved Where's Waldo as a child. I thought ""Can You Find It?"" might be an interesting advance on the same concept. The gift was much appreciated. He liked the selection of paintings and finding things within the art work, plus the education aspect made fun. Poured over it after pouring a cup of coffee each morning during his Christmas visit. Waldo a distant (but fond!) memory."
4,welcome sydney!,"i defintely enjoyed this book. i love the characters in the allen-teague ad agency, and all the other characters in this book. i especially enjoy the realistic aspect of the ad agency having to deal with it's clients, etc. this book is casually written so that you feel almost like sydney is talking to you rather than you are reading a book. i have now read smoke screen and just started cuttings, but i would definitely like to add sydney to my list of favorite detectives."
2,overwrought,"Overwrought writing style, alternating with long uninteresting descriptions of the minutiae of everyday life. Tiresome example of modern mystery novels where quantity of writing is somehow equated with quality. The best modern mystery writer, and even he has his weaker moments, is Robert Barnard. Ms. Underwood Grant should read his mysteries to see how it's done."
2,Yuk,I was so excited to get this product but was very disappointed in the flavor. It just doesn't take natural. I guess it's a better alternative to being bored when you're trying to get your water down.
4,Monks in the city provide examples and perspective for all.,"The lives of monks, the monastic orders, is a fascinating, intriguing world. Here, in this book is found vignettes of their daily lives within the seemingly unlikely setting of a rough urban area. Not all monks live on mountaintops; this volume shows how lucky we are that they don't. Finding the spiritual and the holy in everyday and even challenging circumstance is something these monks strive to acheive; this man's efforts and musings on the process provide good perspective for our own ordinary lives, Catholic or not. This book was a welcome refreshing quiet break from the bustle and stress of my everyday life, providing insight and some thought provoking challenges in any given, regular day. Very enjoyable, very readable, not preachy, academic or dogmatic in the least. I gave it to my husband to read next in the hopes that it would also add some perspective on his stress filled life."
2,So Close Yet So Far,"This game pad is almost great. Good build quality and a nice array of controls, but the quality control is probably lacking. The Thrustmaster I received has a dead spot when when trying to ""turn"" left using the left joystick.I verified in windows and in my racing game that this dead spot was only on the left joystick and only smaller left ""turn"" inputs fall into the ""dead zone."" Sometimes it actually registers right input when I move the joystick left. Not nearly precise enough for serious gamers."
1,Can't say it is junk but I'm not sure what it should be used for,"I bought this converter a few weeks ago to power up my microwave oven. I popped in a bag of corn and used the preset timer 'Popcorn' which is about three minutes. At the end of three minutes the job was incomplete so I decided to give it an extra minute, as soon as I press the start button: Pop but this time it was not the corn. the converter went dead. Can't say what this piece of equipment is designed to used with, it says heating appliances. Well I would have thought that a microwave oven is a heating appliance but someone has proven me wrong. So if you plan on using this with a microwave oven, please save your money!"
5,Best Kylie Cd,I think Kylie really showed her goods as a singer on this cd it was well thought out and the songs were perfect for her voice and I was captivated the whole time I listened. I think Light Years and this cd are her best work. I give her thumbs up for this.
3,A maturing Kylie Minogue in transition.,"Kylie Minogue is truly a music survivalist who rides the tides of the everchanging currents of the frigid music scene. Although Kylie breaks new ground musically, the hip-hop and R&B sounds do not suit her thin vocals well. A move in the right direction, but still a misguided effort by Ms. Minogue."
3,"Just because its kylie, doesn't mean it's ""bad""","While Kylie's never released a really good album, this album contains occasional moments of brilliance! but it's not great, Confide In Me is good and a few others, but it's not spectacular. Kylie is just a pop star but I get the feeling that when she released this album she thought she was more than what she is, and this is Kylie taking herself a bit too seriously, still it's an OK album with no intention to mind boggle people."
3,Too much fluff,"I am an American who has missed Kylie since returning from an extended stay in Australia. I enjoyed all her early hits and, after seeing her at the Sydney Olympics, I was looking for some more of her infectious vocals. I bought this album and (dark cover/Impossible Princess). Outside of ""Confide in Me,"" which I absolutely love, I thought all the rest of the songs were remarkably stale. Not much thought put into the lyrics or the production. I almost cancelled Impossible Princess, but I am thrilled I didn't as it is all the things this album isn't. Get your hands on Confide in Me somehow(I have it on a Triple J compilation), but I wouldn't bother with this album if you have certain limits as to just how mindless you like your dance/pop."
3,Good for Kylie beginners or radio listeners,"1st release after leaving PWL in 1992. 1st single Confide In Me introduced Minogue's new sound and worked well as her departure from Euro-trash (UK chart entry at No. 2). Put Yourself In My Place (2nd single) and Dangerous Game are also worth listening, but the album is over-stuffed with suger-coated slow love songs. Kylie Minogue (94) is good for Kylie beginners or radio listeners; if you want real Kylie sound, go for Impossible Princess/Kylie Minogue (98)."
5,Never had a problem - Bought over a year ago.,"Good Price, Decent Speed.RAM is constantly used everyday for hours on ends, and sometimes not in the most coldest places. My computer stays on always, and I can't remember a single problem with it. I'm quite picky when it comes to computer stuff.Pros - works!Cons - none"
4,review,"I love them,That's why I bought two packings although they warm up more than others, but they work very well"
1,This is a frigging rip-off,"I bought this CD thinking it was the original fab 60's recordings from the incredible Tommy Roe. Instead, the backing tracks have been replaced by awful eighties sounding drums and synths in a horrid attempt by some coked out producer to ""update' the sound. This is not indicated anywhere on the outside of the CD. Don't buy this piece of crap. Instead, go buy the Greatest Hits package which indicates ""All Original Recordings"". Or just buy something from the 1910 Fruitgum Company, Gooey Blowhole and gthe Squids, or The False Moves."
4,One of my favorite Sax-Man,"I've been listening to Fausto Papetti from the 70's, and always enjoy his music. I was re-introduced to his music again just last week. The album ""All Time Favorites"" has my most memorable cuts, (I would love to get a copy). I just love his music."
1,Troubled Tee s,"Pay attention to the star rating. This was a terrible purchase. Reads like a sixth-grade writing project. Poor grammar, poorly written. Run from this one, people! You already know the contents of this disappointing offer."
1,Self Help 4 who??,You received a one star rating only because they made me put onethey wouldn't except a zero.I'm not interested in a book or books I can't even find out what they are about.Seems to me you don't want anyone to see. Which is a shame. Especially for our troubled teens.I'm looking for help for a teen and you don't make it one bit easy.what is it going to hurt to be able to read the table of contents or the back page of ur book???Think about it. I'm very disappointed
3,Invicta Watch - Not the best,"The watch is very nice, but the bracelet is not friendly and not practical. It loosen very often. Other than than everything is fine"
5,Pleased With Purchase,This was a very pleasant experience. The item I bought is of high quality and was shipped intact and quickly.Thank you for your service. Keep up the good work. God bless!
3,Overly cheerleader-ish,"I noticed that this book had practically nothing bad to say about anything in the park. It is extremely enthusiastic about everything (for example, while slightly acknowledging the cheesy nature of the Kong ride, the book just goes on about how pretty the scenery is instead.) It makes it sound like Universal invented the S&S Space Shot tower with Dr. Doom's Fearfall, when, in actuality, the same ride was made by many parks first... etc. Do you know what's even better? When I was browsing the Universal gift shops, this book was featured prominently in many of them. If you want the book that Universal wants you to read, get this one."
5,Levi's best Mahler yet!,"This CD was outstanding. A great display of Levi's clearsighted approach to music, something especially needed in this symphony. It sounds truly romanitic, as it should. Atlanta plays with a great Mahler sound and emotively throughout. Highly recommended!"
3,Good book for general class assessment,"This book works well for a short preassessment of student knowledge and the teacher can begin to take from where the students stop, covers a good variety of topics. Simple language and generalized enough to fit into any media class."
5,a gift of a book,"what can i say? this is one of the most inspiring, empowering, revealing books i own. it is filled with deep ""ah-hah"" moments and carefully chosen words and fluid description. it is not preachy or light-hearted, but rather allows each person to find a lesson for themselves by giving depth and color to the words for emotions and feelings. every time i read it, i have new revelations and each time i share it with someone new, they love it as instantly as i did. buy two copies... you'll want to give one to someone as soon as you read the first few pages."
4,An Old Favorite,I owned this book for many years often quoting from it to friends. I either lent it or lost it in a move. I missed it. An old friend returned.
4,Creative and interesting!,"The Book of Qualities is a creative and poetic way of looking at human emotion. I especially appreciated the allusions to nature. As a visual learner/processor, the book gave me lots of fuel for thinking about emotions in different kinds of ways."
5,Did I write this book? Or did Gendler read my mind?,"Well, there's no way I could have written this book because I can never seem to find the words like a professional can. But, while reading this, it was as though Gendler took my thoughts and put them into creative prose and published a fantastic little book with them. I like that this book allows the reader to interpret as they'd like and take lessons from it without being preachy. I imagine this is a book I'll be able to pick up and read over and over, finding something new in it every time."
5,BUY ONE FOR EVERY PERSON OF QUALITY!,"How insightful that Gendler was able to embrace each of our complex emotions and honor them as a friend, guest, or acquaintance! I pick up my short copy when I feel ""out of sorts"" and her beautifully-written words help me understand my ambiguity as tenderly as a friend, as helpfully as a psychotherapist. I am considering using some of her models in the writing classes I teach. Ms. Gendler, keep wearing those orange sneakers and thank you for introducing me to all of my qualities--especially the ones I thought I didn't have!"
1,A for Awful,"I have been pursuing and reading 50's Sci-Fi since the 1970's and I have to say that without question, hands down, this is the worst ""Golden Age"" Sci-Fi novel I have ever read. Nearly incoherent plot, oafish, unlikeable main character (Dick Jones, of all the possible names you could muster -- heaven help us all), wooden dialogue, flimsy motivations, secondary characters created and discarded at will, paper tiger adversaries, an unlikely society, and just plain not interesting! It was chore to get to the end. And the ending is completely unsatisfying. A total abortion. Do not buy it."
2,Doesn't work for me,"The basic idea is neat, the execution lacks. The Gizmo World is highly implausible, the story is weak, the characters are bland.A better desription of a world without material needs is the Culture."
4,love animals,a must have game for all animal lovers you get to have all kinds of different animals and you can build a home for them anyway you like i love this game
3,"Cool, but not as good as Zoo Tycoon 2","the only down side to this game is ... you can't go into ""guest mode"" ... whereas in Zoo Tycoon 2, you can hit guest mode and see how your zoo looks on that level ...I really miss that in this version ... it just feels like something is missing, so I don't play it as much.;-)"
5,Still excellent advice!,"This book matched it's description perfectly. Great book, easy to read, very practical. The processing and shipping was very quick!"
3,ordered for a friend,i ordered this movie for a friend of mine he says very good price was good also if my friend says if you looking for a good strong christian movie then look into this one
4,Excellent breakthrough album,"I had 100 broken windows when it came out and i still think its one of my most important albums (out of 550+), so i don't know why it took me so long to get their first full length album.Many reviewers used the words pop and mainstream to describe this album and admitdly there are a few soft songs but otherwise this is a raw emo-punk album. The opening track is a short 1min hard punk belter. The other tracks have the hard/ melodic feel to them, reminiscent of At the Drive-In. The best song has to be 'I see shapes'.To be honest on my first listen this album was hard to comprehend, but give it time (about 4 listens), and then critically analyse it and i'm sure fans of the latter album would love it. I'm off to get their Captain E.P."
4,Go with Broken Windows,"This album is like boys playing, while Idlewild's 100 Broken Windows album is like men rocking. Idlewild made a huge quality leap from Hope is Important to 100 Broken Windows, which is why I would recommend skipping this CD and going directly to Broken Windows, an all-time favorite of mine."
5,Excellent. Don't ask questions.,"I don't reccomend as having this as a favorite band, as the lyrics aren't that interesting and have no real point when you think about them. But the songs- they're just quality. Don't doubt it, go with it, and it'll be nice to you."
2,"Nothing like picture, different color, not soft","I was looking for a replacement to a ball I recently picked up in Australia. It was a great indoor ball with a soft, bouncy core, wrapped in two red PVC halves held together by real stitches.This ball is much too hard for indoor use. The one I received was also red & white, not all red. The fake seam on the ball is very sharp on the fingers too."
2,Not worth the money,"This ball is not worth the money. It worse off in just two overs. The PVC started coming off. This ball is heavier than the cricket ball, and even thought it's soft if you press on it, it's really not safe. You still need protective gear. Just buy the regular cricket ball. Or, if you're looking for a safer alternative for backyard cricket, put some electric tape on a tennis ball."
3,u-Niq,"3 1/2Always a step or two away from making a consistently great record, this still belongs in just about any electronic aficionados stash for its impressive range and strong production keeping much of the work here fresh, despite a technology lapse that goes with the genre, dating these akin to dog years."
3,Men from Mars Women from Venus,"Fundamentally, men and women have always thought differently, it has gone on since the beginning of time. Yet, if we took the time in the first place to know each others personality types, to have patience and understanding, instead of rushing into a relationship blindly.This book has gone a long way to guide people in the right direction.Nina Bagnall"
2,sounded good,It just wasn't. the book is for single people who like to party and sleep around... I'm not any of these things. It sounded like a mature book but turned out to be a bunch of stuff I already know about life.
2,Paperback Edition: Not to my liking!,"This paperback was too small. It was 7"" tall and 4"" wide.It was 287 pages long.It was difficult to keep the book open.Perhaps there was mention of the size of the book in the description.The book arrived on time. It was brand-new.I hope that this review is of value to other's."
2,When Am I Going to Be Happy?,This book has some good suggestions and examples of real life situation. It does give the reader food for thought.
5,Buy this book!!!,"This is by far the best self help book I have ever read and can even imagine existing. I was having a rough patch, and bought 3 self help books from Amazon, I started one, it bored me, I moved to this, read it super fast, recommended it to everyone I know, and now feel like my other self help books don't even need to be read! This book is not boring like most, and it doesn't have a lot of boring and tedious exercises. It's a super easy read, entertaining and makes SO much sense!These lessons should be taught in school. I've been seeing people on the street and thinking, ""They need to read my book!"" It addresses esteem issues, social issues, phobias, and on and on. The stuff in the book is quite easy to apply too. It's great. Get it. Get it for everyone you know who isn't perfectly happy. It changed my life in a way that I don't think many other self help books or even therapy could."
5,My favorite book,I have owned at least 4 of these books and constantly talk about it. I have given them as gifts and some have been borrowed and never returned. Over the past 5 years I have recommended this book to all of my friends. It is great for anyone who has broken up with someone or who just feels down in the dumps. It is very uplifting and if you can actually make a change in your life this book will help you. Trust me!
3,Good information,I liked this book as I found a lot of similarities in the actions of the people mentioned in the book and myself. It can get pretty wordy and redundant as the author drives a point home - but I finished actually remembering a lot of what was said.
2,You've seen it all before...,"I wanted to see this movie because the subject of urban exploration fascinates me. I didn't read the reviews. BAD mistake. This movie has two major flaws. One, the godawful camera work, and two, its predictability. I realized what was going on 30 minutes into it. I believe I speak for the majority when I say the shaky handheld camera ""effect"" has been played to death. It's no longer original or effective. It's annoying and nauseating and belongs only in death metal music videos. Apart from that, there are some major continuity issues and total lack of coherence that will drive you up the wall if you dare seriously think about it. All in all, this movie seemed like a desperate attempt to somehow fill 90 minutes of screen time. Don't repeat my mistake, save yourself some time and money and skip this one."
2,Dissapointment,"I gave this movie a chance, hoping that the reviews I'd seen were wrong and that they were just missing the point. Turns out: I should trust people more often.The acting was unconvincing, and the Blair Witch style camera effects dealt the movie a bad blow. A more effective cinematography style could have granted this movie at least a ""watch it for the pretty places"" review, but no. The places they explore in this movie would have been so much prettier could I have had more than a split second to look at where they were.As for this being an effective portrayal of urban exploration: it isn't. It got some things right and some things so incredibly wrong.The movie was linear till about the mid point, then decided it wanted to be something else entirely, and when it finally wrapped up I felt dissapointment I rarely feel with cinema."
2,"AFTER ALL, IT IS A ""B"" MOVIE!!!","I was not expecting much when I sat down to watch this movie, and that is exactly what I got...not much. I do not want to say anything to spoil the movie in case you have not watched it yet. I will say that it was hard to follow until the end when it all comes together. Unfortunately, by that time, it was too late. The whole time you are watching this movie, you are scratching your head just trying to figure it out and when you do figure it out, it just leaves you with an unsatisfied feeling. Who knows, you might enjoy it. As for me, it just didn't cut it."
1,Astonishingly bad!!,"As someone else wrote the Blair witch camera work is very annoying. Even worse, when the camera is not shaky and trailing they use another gimic and the shots are over solarised and washed out to the point of invisible.Plot and premise were interesting enough. Location innovative. No matter these virtues were completely overridden by the stupid production gimicks.I found it practically unwatchable. I can't remember when a movie last annoyed me quite this much.If I could bother to remember the director and cameraman's names I would be sure to boycott them forever going forward.Flora Montgomery should shoot her agent. How does she wind up in these roles. Furthermore if you're a fan of hers. She has little more than a bit part and then she is rendered almost invisible."
1,This movie gave me a headache,My mom is visiting and I thought I was being nice and gave her the remote. She likes quirky movies and kept waiting for this movie to make sense. At a certain point I could tell that it never would. She became stubborn and watched it until the end.The crap camera work and all the green lighting came me a headache. At least my mom handed me back the remote...
3,I was so bored when reading this...,"Not a bad book, really, but a little one-sided. Provides a good overview of things though."
1,Not what we needed,"If your looking for something to test your pool or hot tub - will work for you - If you need to test water systems, you will need a better product."
3,Not sure about these,"Some of the colors on the strips don't even match the chart you compare it to, primarily on the Alkalinity. Probably better strips on the market"
3,Work great but cheaper at Ace HW,I buy just about everything on Amzn but I was just at ACE and was a bit surprised that they wanted $10.49 for these but they had a 20% sale so I grabbed one. Then when I got home I checked here and was surprised that the price is nearly 50% more.
2,These are giving me strange readings,"I bought these after seeing the positive reviews, but they just didn't work properly at all... the bromine level was 0 when I know it isn't, same with alkalinity even though I know there's plenty, the pH is a weird color that doesn't seem to match any of the options, and calcium also shows up as none. None of those numbers made any sense since I know the water was properly balanced recently. So I went out and bought some AquaChek test strips and those showed that everything really is just fine (it just needed a little more bromine).I don't know if I just got a bad batch of test strips, but I've tried them several times now over the past month, and they still don't seem to be giving me readings that make any sense. The bottle says ""8/13"", so they haven't expired, so I'm not sure what the problem is."
5,Guitars and pleasure,"The pleasure of the voices of Russell and Liz together in Play God, the guitars of Kevin... I can't wait for the new album to be released !"
1,SENT WRONG STAIN !!!,SEND WHITE BASE TINT NOT WHITE OAKNO COLOR ADDED AT ALL WORELESS CRAPWAISTED TIME AND MONEY NO RETURN POLICY
5,Love!,"This product is amazing! It has taken out stains that have been in clothing for years. I got out stains from my oldest daughter's clothing and my youngest can wear them stain-free now. This one product can replace all of your cleaners except one for your dishwasher. It's too sudsy for a dishwasher, but is great for actual dishwashing. I will never go back to my old way of cleaning or doing laundry."
5,A+,"I have been using this soap for doing dishes and love it! I can't convince my husband to use it to clean the bathrooms yet, but I'm working on it. :)"
2,Loved before I knew ingredient Cocamidopropyl betaine voted 2004 ALLERGEN OF THE YEAR by Amer Contact Dermatitis Society,"I was in love with Sal Suds before I investigated all of the ingredients on the EWG website. Unfortunately the second ingredient ""Coco-Betaine"" aka, Cocamidopropyl betaine was voted 2004 ALLERGEN OF THE YEAR by American Contact Dermatitis Society. Dr. B. website states: Coco-Betaine: Mild and easily biodegradable, coco-betaine is formed by combining coconut fatty acids with betaine (a nature-identical synthetic so-named because it was first discovered in sugar beets). This foam-boosting cleansing agent buffers irritation caused by SLS.I was using Sal Suds for laundry, cleaning, dishes, everything, and I didn't mind the cost before I knew this information. Now I've reconsidered my devotion to the product and will no longer use :("
1,Contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate ?!,"I haven't used this soap, but it contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - not good. Google it if you haven't heard of it. Also often abbreviated SLS. I don't see this in all of Dr. Bonner's products though."
5,Great Multi-Use Cleaner,"This product is strong enough for most household cleaning tasks, and mild enough delicate surfaces. It dries with no residue, which is great for cleaning glass. The fragrance is a mild 'pine' scent and is not overpowering or harsh on the nose. I highly recommend it."
5,Great for Laundry!,"I use about 4 cap fulls of Sals Suds per load(standard size washer-not an HE). My laundry comes out fresh and clean, and my whites are certainly whiter. Best detergent I have ever used!"
1,Not well researched,There doesn't seem to be any voice to the author. This book is like a college term paper on DOGME--I give it a C. The book reads like a collection of magazine articles or an unauthorized biography. We have seen most of this material covered in indie filmmaker magazines countless times before. Dogme is a niche component of a larger digital film movement that is sweeping cinema and threatening celluloid. I would have appreciated more discussion of the impact and influence of dogme on the current mavericks of digital filmmakers that are arising and gaining respect. Digital filmmaking has greatly impacted the short film industry. Where does dogme and short film co-exist
2,worth buying if only for 1 song,"effity eff. This has bad production and pretty much stinks, but there are a couple great songs that deserved to be recorded better. Not as good as Siamese Pipe."
4,Fabulous Hell Written So Well!,"With its sinful comicbook-like cover, Fabulous Hell is definitely one of those books that you pick up to take a peek inside and hope no one finds you looking! You can sift through any page reading it inside your mind, and Craig Curtis' narrative will quickly draw you in. It's even more fun to read out loud to yourself or to others! The one-liners in this book were meant to be jotted down in your journal and recited during those unsober moments when everyone needs a laugh! Curtis weaves a nasty little tale with ""who cares"" attitude that leaves you rolling your eyes and laughing out loud. You'll be thinking, ""bitter...party of one...your table is ready,"" but by the time you finish this book you'll want to join that party and have a great time! It's definitely a quick and fun read for anyone who has ever said, ""been there, done that!"""
3,Fabulous Rant.....,"Knowing the author made this personal to a degree, but after getting past the venom, the book is an accurate display of what ""the life"" is about. Nothing written was more than a nanometer from absolute truth with regard to the tribulations the ""narrator"" expounded upon. All can learn from the devastating experiences, and take warning from the feelings of despair and self-loathing apparent in the book. Most of all, one cannot help but feel a degree of compassion, if not pity, for the main character. More so for his family, taking the brunt of the attacks."
4,Works Great,"I bought this HD to rebuild a DELL inspiron 600m. Drive was easy to install, and format. Drive is also quiet. I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Nice upgrade for my PS3,Really don't have much to say about the product other than Western Digital is an excellent product. I purchased the hard drive for my PS3 and it works great. A great upgrade to my previous 80GB hard drive.
1,Dead out or the box,"I received this product, installed it, started up my computer, and...nothing happened. Blue screen, message saying ""no C/drive detected"", or something like that. Tried it three times. Whether the drive itself was bad, or there was some software lacking, I don't know.I sent it back, ordered a drive from DriveSolutions (through Amazon), works perfectly."
4,Un libro bueno por leyendo en voz alta,"This translation is not the best one I've used but works well for younger crowds. It rhymes on some pages but not all which makes for a somewhat awkward read the first time around. With a little practice, though, the book is wonderful to use in a Spanish language storytime. The story is very simple as are the pictures so it could be used for toddler and preschool age groups. The book would also be good for those just starting to read in Spanish since many of the words are basic and the text is somewhat sparse."
5,"Cute, sturdy, and educational.",I bought this book for myself because I am learning Spanish. I have enjoyed it immensely as have my little sisters. The book is about a day at the farm. There are only animals in the well done art. I'd sure recommend this book to anyone trying to learn Spanish.
5,Cute and Funny stories,The stories are cute and funny and my baby loves them. They are told in a clear child's voice and are interesting and imaginative. The illustrations are adorable.
2,Choppy....,"This novel reads more like an outline with big holes in both the character development and the plot. Unlike the professional reviews, I didn't mind the excerpts that were the foundation of the historical quest - what bothered me were the characters themselves. I found their behavior to be at times bizarre and had a hard time liking any of them. The situations and the characters' reactions were far-fetched with no surrounding build-up of detail to back up the plot. I give this 2 stars for originality and 0 stars for detail and character development."
2,A Hollywood Movie,"The novel is entertaining, yet lacks depth. The character's actions were somewhat predictable.The story builds up nicely, yet at the height of the story, the author scrambles quickly to get to the conclusion."
5,Another view into Wartime Internment,"This is a beautiful, as well as important, book about another aspect of the wartime internment of Japanese Americans during World War Two. It accompanies the exhibit of artifacts, ""Art of Gaman."" Although there are a number of books on this same subject this one is, I assume by virtue of money spent, the most vivid, pictorially. For people with little knowledge of the forced evacuation there are basic introductory essays on the event which gives the artifacts and art a good context."
4,Great Family Game,"My son and I watched this show and I thought the game would be fun to play. My family gets a kick out of it and plays together and individually. You can play 1 - 4 players which is nice, and you rotate the top part to reflect whose turn it is. The only downside is that the messages scroll across the screen between picks, rounds, at the beginning of rounds, and before the last suitcase is revealed. In order to skip over it you can press a button but it is still pretty annoying sometimes. I like the fact that you can turn off the sound due to the fact it is pretty loud. It is fun to play though."
3,Deal or No Deal,The game will click off if you press the buttons a little too hard. Once that happens everything in the current game is lost and one must use a pointed object to reset the game from the back. It is hard to read the display to determine what numbers are still available.
4,Fun for the whole family,"I bought this game for my Father, who had a severe stroke last year - he is unable to use his right side or talk, but he likes playing this game. He loves the TV show of Deal or No Deal and this just makes it more accessible for him anytime of the day. My kids also like playing it."
1,This game wouldn't let me win!,"I was at a friends house and started to play this game, they eliminated the million dollar case except me. I chose it when it was my time to play and I always chose the "" No deal"" option. Seemed to work fine the whole time except when the only 2 cases left were the 750k case and my 1 million dollar case. then somehow it was non responsive, I tried everything to make it work but after 20 minutes of trying I got bored and took the deal to see if it was still working. What a surprise... It did. What a scam I wouldn't want to buy this game for myself"
2,Like the TV show,"OK game, thought it was too expensive.Like the TV show, it takes too long, and you get tired of the same thing sooner rather than later."
4,Just like the TV show,"I bought this for my 10 year old grandson for Christmas and we have enjoyed it. It is just like the TV show but without Howie and the girls. It is made out of very cheap plastic, but unless for some reason it gets thrown around, it should last. No educational value, just luck to win, but it is fun."
4,Entertaining and simple,This product was great for our 9 year old. It is simple to use and can be played alone or with others. It is entertaining for adults too.
3,Timberline 700 Combat Pen for Everyday Writing,"Nice and hefty in large hands. Great for writing everyday. Were it made in the USA, I'd give it 5 stars. I've grown weary of having to purchase or pass on good products due to country of origin. Couldn't pass on this one, so swallowed my objections and made the purchase."
1,A Pretentious Upgrade,"Bridge Baron 15 contains silly graphics and many cumbersome and unnecessary maneuvers. Replays are the most annoying. Wheras in older versions replays went zip, 15 plays them out almost card for card regardless of the player's preset options. A host of conventions are available, a lot more than the average player uses, but the simplicity of play and bidding are gone."
3,One Negative Comment,I wish the game could be enlarged to fill my entire computer screen. 5 by 8 inches or so is difficult for me to see.
2,Could be better,This book is a little difficult to read for the very fact that the subject material is a little boring. It does not do a good job of holding your attention and the chapters are so long
2,Take Care With This Edition,"I am deeply disappointed with the very bad graphic quality of this edition. It is a xerox edition; it is so poor that you cannot satisfactorily visualize the pictures. I really think that the authors do not know what the publishers did with that important oeuvre. It is a shame, no matter the price went down and down. Take care with this edition. It reflects the decadence of environmental psychology ?"
3,typical,"This recording typifies recordings of masterworks by the mormon tabernacle choir and friends. It is, as usual, technically ok, and rather on the bland side. The diction, while sometimes clear, frequently features overprominent stress of consonants; a typical feature of amateur choirs. The soloists perform amicably with a strained sounding translation. The soprano sounds too adolescent at times for my taste. Mr. Gunn seems try too hard just to sound like a baritone to the sacrifice of a clearer upper register, although the tone in general is fairly pleasing.Honestly, why base a translation on the KJ edition of the bible when Brahms went to all the trouble to avoid it in the first place? I do think an honest, but poetic, literal translation would much better serve the purpose. Anway, there are so many superior recordings of this work, and several in english as well, that I think it a waste to bother with this recording unless you have some personal connection to it, perhaps."
3,Brahms' German Requiem (in English),"One of my favorite scores, but not my favorite version. Nothing compares to Otto Klemperer. I am not fond of this arrangement."
3,Brahms: Requiem by Mormon Tabernacle Choir & Utah Symphony,"A bit ponderous, typical for MTC. The only recorded version I could find of the Brahms Requiem in English. Fine for study, for the choral performance I'm rehearsing."
5,match made in heaven,"Being a resident of Utah, I was enthused to find a collaboration with Telarc and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Utah Symphony. Moreover, Robert Shaw himself had planned to do this recording, but died three weeks before he could do so. Nonetheless, his works/notes/translations of Brahms' requiem into English have survived and in beautiful fashion! If you have heard this work by Brahms before, you won't be disappointed. The signature fourth movement and also the sixth movement are particularly moving! I'm sure Maestro Shaw is smiling up there..."
4,The German Requiem - hope unrealized,"Finally, the German Requiem in English! But... The performance of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is vocally well balanced and supported by solid orchestral work. The dynamics are good with excellent choral and orchestral control and execution. My disappointment is in the deplorable lack of clarity of diction. If I had not sung the Requiem many times, I would have had great difficulty in deciphering the words of both chorus and solo pieces. The fabled clarity of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir was nowhere to be found. The music is melodic and soothing in places and energizing in others. But, the performance is useless as a vehicle to deliver the message of the composition. I was sorely disappointed at this rendition of one of my great choral favorites."
1,Not worth the rental fee,"Anthony Hopkins is certainly a mega-star in the acting world. However, his recent attempt at filmmaking failed miserably. Slipstream is a movie about movie-making, and if you, like I do, think those usually are boring and pretty pointless: Slipstream is unbelievably bad. It didn't impress anybody much; it earned $6000 (that's six thousand dollars) in its first and only week it played in selected theaters.There is a handful of reviews of this movie on the net. One that IMO best described Slipstream's content compared it to a boy in a video game store playing all the games at the same time - that's what Slipstream's endless visual effects look like. Annoying and pointless.Rent at your own discretion; you've been warned. And before I'm accused of the crime of anti-Hopkinism, know that until ""Slipstream"" I enjoyed each and every film with Anthony Hopkins acting in them."
3,How I Went From Hating It To Being 'Interested',"As most of you, I am a fan of Anthony Hopkins (unlike most of you I hated Silence of the Lambs as it seemed to me to glorify cruelity)I started watching this film cold turkey and after 20 minutes, I was thinking ""This is the stupidest, dumbest, most irritating pile of crap I have seen"" and I turned it it off but out of respect I went to Anthony Hopkins commentary...and like Seinfeld, he admitted it was a filmm ""about nothing', he just wanted to play with his imagination...First of all I could listen to him and/or James Earl Jones read the phone book and still love...but he makes some interesting philosophical observations..So it was like having dinner with Mr. Hopkins just 'for the hell of it'Fun, but I would never watch it again..."
3,Bipolar POV,"Superbly written, with a fantastic edit design. a juicy experiment of a film. every single person who worked on this film will be blessed for showing support to such a project. Guts with glory is one thing, but guts without glory is pure guts...and Sir Tony has shown what his insides are made of. A film fron a point of view of a Bipolar disorder occupant. Now we know how Edgar Allan Poe really died! He was bipolar and his stories got to him!Rave on Mr Hopkins!"
2,pretentious and disappointing,This was pretentious and disappointing. The posturings of a sullen adolescent. I expected SOMETHING from this great actor. A mishmash of cliches.
2,Stopped holding a charge in 4 months,"Got this as a replacement for Pavilion DV6000 laptop. Performed well when it was new, but started losing capacity within 3 months. Totally can't hold a charge anymore after 4 months. The laptop shuts down as soon as the battery charger is plucked out. A total waste of money. Wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this unless you need it for less than 4 months!"
4,Good to have an extra battery.,"I ordered this battery, because I thought it was the reason for my HP Laptop's failure. After I got the battery, I realized that the problem was in the ac adapter/wall plug! Oh, well. it's always good to have an extra battery!"
2,even worse than original,purchased to replace original battery which had decreased run time to about 20 minutes. prepped battery and got almost an hour of run time for about a month. after about 2 months it was good for the same 15-20 minutes. at least the original took a year and a half to poop out.
5,Just what I was looking for,This product is authentic and complete. All the seasons of L Word in a convenient and sturdy case. Packaging was durable and the set arrived unharmed and ready to be given as a gift.
4,Amazingly awesome series,"This series is completely amazing. Too bad the special features are really dumb. I was excited to watch the cast reunion special thinking at least that might be good. No, it was terrible too. But I didn't buy this for the special features, I bought it because I LOVE the show."
5,Great Entertainment,"Since we did not have Showtime for much of the ""L Word"" run and since iTunes fails to offer Season 1 - it has been great fun to watch the series on DVD. The show has great humor and always very entertaining ... the best part is it shows an overall positive view of the Gay Ladies. Where is the ""L Word"" movie!?!"
4,the L word,"very happy with product...unfortunately cannot play it on european CD player, is not compatible.Can only view item on PCPlease mention this on your item when presenting it to European viewers."
1,STILL WAITING,I wouldn't know. I haven't received my package yet. My wife was suppose to receive it by the 30th of March. STILL WAITING!!
1,Started out great... Then not so great.,"Everything went fine until season 3. The discs were brand new and completely sealed when we received them, but for some reason season 3 skips to the point you cannot watch it. I spent hard earned money on the entire series collection and now we have to miss out on an entire season. NOT HAPPY!"
3,seaons?,i want to buy all 6 seasons. do you know if this item comes with all 6? and how many discs are for each season?
4,disc skipping,anyone else buy this and season 2 discs skip at the beginning of the show ???? thats as far as ive watched..
5,"If you love the show, you need these DVDs","These were bought as a gift for me. I love the show, so of course I love the DVDs. I watched the series when it debuted and absolutely loved the show, however now that I am ""older and wiser"" I see how far-fetched the show is. I see it as a lesbian soap opera. All lesbians are not this glamorous, dress well, or look like they have eating disorders.... but I'm not reviewing the series... The DVDs are for collectors who want to keep watching the show even after it has left..."
4,L-Word Review,My roommate loves this series and she had only watched a few episodes. So I bought it for her and it is all she has been watching. I would say it was a great purchase.
4,Great serie,This box set is great and very complete. I love how all the dvds are set up. Just a Recommendation... It should have spanish and other subtitles.
1,BOOOOOORING,Wow.... after reading the reviews i decided to watch it... matter fact i'm watching it right now but i find it so boring that i had to came and do a review about it... i like clint eastwood but this is sooooooooooo boring. point blank.
2,Plot doesn't add up,"Intelligent? Not the plot. In many places the plot does not add up, and the myth of the omnipotent, omnipresent character just doesn't wash anymore. Eastwood's ego would have him make movies into his eighties, when he should simply step down, or at least cut out the roles which require him to do things only a young man could do. And what, I ask, would the secret service have to gain by killing Eastwood's daughter? Twice? Just plain silly."
2,Overdone and overrated.,This film tried too hard to be suspenseful. The book was great but the movie was too slow and tedious. Hackman as a menacing predator didn't work for me. Eastwood was typical Eastwood. Quiet and strong. Never budging. The plot was good but the film failed to meet the quality of the book. I found the film ludricous and boring. Just another president with all the power movie. Boring. Get a new idea or follow the book more closely next time.
1,Rediculous World's worst screen play!,"It must have been an embarrassment for the good actors who they got to work this script to have participated. The premis, the logic and the flow of this piece was so silly that I kept on wanting to fast forward it.. I resisted but only because I thought the actors could pull off something intelligent. To No Avail it stunk to the bitter end. Just A Dumb Movie!!!!"
2,Blech! And that's being generous!,"A great opening twenty minutes, and then... nothing. The script, the direction, the acting- everything is fumbled. Eastwood asks the audience to condemn abuse of power but also indulges his own Dirty-Harry image. See ""All The President's Men"" (also from writer Goldman) instead, even if you already have."
4,absolutely delightful,"This is one of my favorite movies for a variety of reasons. The acting is superb. The script, written by The Princess Bride author is true to the Baldacchi (spelling?). Add to this, the music is hauntingly beautiful. I've recommended this movie mega times."
2,Kind of Cheesy,"I usually love Clint Eastwood movies and was looking forward to watching this one, which has such a stellar cast. But Absolute Power is not up to Eastwood's usual standards. The writing is kind of cheesy, the end is both predictable and absurd (which is not an easy feat) and all the fine actors in it can't save such bad material."
5,Brilliant Thriller!!,"In the dark times of the Clinton presidency of scandal and corruption ....this movie really hit home. I was amazed that Hollywood even let this movie slide by, considering their Leftist politics!Gene Hackman plays a Clinton like President who cheats on his wife and biggest fund raising supporter,...with his chief of staff..seemingly resembling Hillary Clinton, who covers up for him...added to the dimension of realism to this movie. It almost resembles Tom Clancy's work with all the politics and secret service detail. Given the hilarious irony that a jewel thief/War hero (Clint Eastwood)had more honesty and character than this wife cheating President was even more funny!This movie is one of Clint Eastwood's best...and is enjoyable no matter what party you are from."
3,"Entertaining, but not spectacular","Absolute Power is an entertaining movie that may lack some finesse, but nonetheless keeps ones attention. Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman do a great job as usual. I'm perplexed, however, by the reviewer who thinks there is a racist undertone. I would really appreciate some explanation of this theory. How can you possibly see racism in a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with racism? Throwing out this kind of unexplained sentence at the end of your review is ludicrous. Anyway, overall, this is a good movie worth watching."
3,Good movie; Better book.,"While a movie rarely captures the nuances of the book on which it is based, Absolute Power does a decent job, but at the expense of the book's protagonist. In my mind, this was too significant to overcome, but for anyone having not read the book, the movie is very good. My advice. . . see the movie or read the book-- don't do both."
4,Nice 2 hours of diversion,"Someone on this forum titled their review ""a political thriller."" Not so. There's nothing political about it. Perhaps there might have been a little inspiration by Bill Clinton there - it being created during his tenure, but it stands on its own. For me it's really closer an old fashion morality play, where by the middle of the film you know whose going to come out on top. Still, it's great fun with some quirky scenes - the one where Gene Hackman dances with his chief of staff among the best of them. Where did they come up with that title though?"
5,Absolute Power,"My Husband enjoyed the movie when he saw it on TV he wanted the movie for his Library of movies so I brought it for him. But the song ""Kate's Theme"" is absolutely beautiful!! Cliff Eastwood is brilliant we are fans of him in whatever he plays!!!! But I did not realize that he composed the music to this movie until we saw the credits!!! Wow!!! Love it Love it Love it Love Cliff Eastwood!!!!!"
2,Makes no sense,"There is no rhyme or reason for why anyone does anything in this movie. A prime example: the daughter of the movie's hero suddenly gets all cuddly with the vert cop who, through his own stupidity, almost got her and her father killed. How much stupider can movies get, you tell me."
1,"So bad, it was funny","This movie goes from dark and ugly to ridiculously cliche. I saw in this movie an example of the dangers of absolute unbelievability for a film rather than absolute power of a president.This could have explored the real dynamics of presidential power but instead was a cliche ""suspense"" thriller that was too silly to care about. When it was over, my friends and I simultaneously broke into laughter. That was all it was worth."
1,Absolute Power-Absolutely a waste of time,"A movie whose premise is intriguing, however it soon falls apart with the loose ends starting really early on in the film. Eastwood's direction is abominable; scenes drag on for no purpose. This movie seems like it was written in one evening, with not much thought going into the plot. The film takes a lot of stupid twists for no apparent reason. The dance scene with Gene Hackman and Judy Davis is really rediculous. The resolution to this film is even more unbelievable than the rest of the movie. Davis, Harris, Linney, Glenn, Marshall, and Hackman are all horribly wasted. This movie also seems to carry a racist undertone to it."
5,ABSOLUTE POWER!,"CLINT EASTWOOD is master thief Luther Whitney, who has a front seat view for MURDER! Imagine his SURPRISE when he sees the PRESIDENT of the United States fooling around with a woman, his SHOCK when things turn violent an dhis HORROR when the Secret Service blows her away! SEE Gene Hackman as the President, Ed Harris as the Cop on the trail of the truth, and Scott Glenn as one of the Secret Service agents GONE WRONG! Clint starts to run, but not for long! You will WEEP when his daughter visits his house and finds all these photographs taken by the FATHER she thought did not care about her! This is a suspensful THRILLER where Clint's character starts out on the wrong side of the law but then helps JUSTICE prevail! Directed by CLINT EASTWOOD himself!"
1,Garbage compared to the book,"I usually loathe people who say that, but this was completely different than the book. The first ten minutes are the only thing even close. The book was absolutely fantastic, the whole reason I watched the movie to begin with. The main character from the book, Jack Graham, wasn't even in the movie. I realize things have to be altered, scenes cut, etc. but this was a horrible masacre of an excellent book. I'm surprised the writer even let this happen. So completely disappointed."
4,WHO doesn't Love CLINT?,I am such a Clint Eastwood fan. This movie is very entertaining. Good story. Great supporting actors. Good movie! I definitely recommend this movie.
5,Loved this movie>,"OMG what suspense. Really great movie just goes to show you how far people will go to cover up a murder and kill innocent people and to think, it was all for the president. Well he got what was coming to him, an eye for and eye."
5,Dirty Harry ain't so dirty,One of Clint Eastwood's best performances in this little shown film. Great storyline full of intrigue. Hard to find on the TV. Only found it on DVD.
1,absolute power,was really looking forward to watching this movie. but when i got it it wouldnt work in my dvd player because it was for use in another country !!! very disappointing. so i couldnt rate it. but you should only sell movies that you can play in the usa !!
4,"Decent first half, GREAT second half... Eastwood is perfect!","This was a very good, not great movie. It is a bit slow at first, but you will find that there are just so many little things about this movie that are great. Eastwood is perfect: excellent acting, flawless direction... and he's got some of his typical one-liners. Definitly see this movie."
5,He's One Of The Greats,"Fats always delivers and this cd is no different.I highly recommend it. Little Richard can say all he wants about himself being the only inventor of Rock and Roll But I think that given the fact Fats was recording long before him, Antoine Fats Domino Deserves some credit too. Enough SAID!"
4,Beckett pump,"I'm quite happy with the Beckett pump. It is my second one, with the first lost to a pond skimmer malfuntion leaving the pump without water overnight. I would not hesistate to buy another. Sandy"
1,Broken Impeller,"Item arrived with a broken impeller. I was just going to replace it, but can not find spare parts. It has been a couple of months since I ordered, and I can not contact the seller at this point. I'd like to get a replacement impeller."
2,Was working,"I used this pump to pump water from my pond to my plants, it worked well for the first two weeks then it froze up and stopped working, returned it to Amazon for a replacement. If the replacement does the same thing then I will send it back for refund."
1,2 pumps down,"I have been through two of these pumps in 4 years. My first pump was replaced by the company the ceramic shaft broke internally, now this spring once again the shaft for some reason is getting stuck internally and now I need to figure how to open it to see if it is fixable??? The company did not give me another 2 year warranty on the 2nd one and now I know why. I never leave this on all the time and I never leave it out during the winter. I have baby'd this thing and still sucks and does not pump. I will find it hard to buy another Beckett pump due to the consistent failure at the 2 year mark..."
2,Broke in 6 months!,I was very disappointed with this product. When I walk outside I noticed our pond was not working. When I examined the unit I noticed the plastic flanges that hold the plastic grate over the impeller were broken. Since the plastic grate could not be secured it place the pump could not build pressure to pump water. I did manage to fix it with some large zip ties. It has been working this way for about 4 months.
5,Very good pond pump,I have only had this pump for a month now but it has exceeded my expectations. I have it running in a big natural pond 24x7 with plenty of debris and this pump handles it fine. This was the one issue I was worried about and this pump performs flawlessly (its my fountain heads that clog). The only thing I would change on this pump is the shorter power cord. I had to cut off the end and get a submersible well connection which was $30 to make it to the center of my pond.
5,water fall circ pump,"my expectation of this pump have been met fulley,the water fall in my pond is about four feet high and the flow that the pump puts out is very good.i'm using a 1""line out of the discharge which was recamended by the maufacturer. i've had the pump about a month and i'm very satisfied at this time. 3-25-2011"
1,Very Expensive for 3 Months of use.,Dont bother with this pump. The lip that holds the outlet housing failed afer 3 months of use rendering the pump useless. Bad design.
5,Efficient,"I've run this pump 12 hours/day in my pond for about a year with no problems. It's quieter and has a little more flow than the Little Giant with the same GPM rating that it replaced. It draws 300 Watts, about half the power used by that Little Giant. Too bad the price has gone up 30% in the last year though."
5,Beckett waterfall pump,"I have used this pump for several years in my pond. After several years of service my pump failed, so I went to a local Home Depot to buy a replacement. The price was high, very high I thought, but I bought it anyway. The next time, after several years again, when I needed to replace the pump, I found the same model at Amazon for a drastically lower price and orded it.The pump in any case is a good quality pump,runs quiet and did the job well on my multi waterfall pond. Amazon's pricing and delivery can not be outdone. I would highly recommend getting this pump, and getting it from Amazon."
5,Nero!!,I love this Nero product!! I have been able to create great presentations with my students for their Vocational Portfolios.Thank you for offering this product at an affordable price.
2,NERO (NOT WHAT I EXPECTED),DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SOFTWARE IT DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN SOME OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE ONES OUT THERE.
4,Satisfied,Software was ordered for my wife. She has not used it more than once but found it easy to use. I could say more but as yet total acceptance of the program has not been attained.
1,One of the worse movies I have seen lately,"Riddled with historical inaccuracies that made me guffaw, horribly written,with maudlin scenes and pumped up Mahler tunes, not too mention Celine Dion at the very end. What can I say, truly one of the worse movies that I have seen. A real pity as the film cost 30 million or so and had a decent cast."
1,Bad acting + Boring plot = Waste of money and time,The box cover looks beautiful and elegant. It made me think I was renting an epic movie. I was completely wrong. The picture is beautiful but the plot is boring. The acting is bad. The movie moves at very slow pace. There's no action at all. What a waste of money!
1,The cover is very decieving,"It shows what looks to be an emotional, beautiful epic movie...WRONG! The acting could not have been worse, even the big name actors looked like low-budget wannabes, the movie plods along at an excruciatingly slow, confusing pace and just does not make sense anywhere along the way. I could not see what was so great about the so-called 'witch' woman, nor any of the men that were lusting after her. After about 45 minutes of this train wreck my husband and I could not put up with anymore. Avoid this one at all costs. I'm glas I rented it as a two for one deal, but I still feel cheated."
1,Battle of the Brave,"Can you say false advertising? The cover of the DVD shows epic battles being fought in the background and the description talks about a resistance movement that must take place in the novel version of this movie because you won't see it on the DVD. This is basically a love story, cut and dried! Is it a bad movie, don't buy it, just rent it if you like love stories but if you are expecting something in the way of the Last of the Mohichans, you will want your money back and some. This is the worst case of false advertising I have seen in a long time!"
1,Le crap,"THE BATTLE OF THE BRAVE aka NEW FRANCE (2004) Directed by Jean Beaudin. Score by Patrick Doyle.Starring Gerard Depardieu, David Troughton, Tim Roth (as William Pitt the Elder), Colm Meaney (as Benjamin Franklin) and Jason Isaacs as General James Wolfe.A French/Quebec production about the last year of the French and Indian War that is truly hideous in every respect. I felt bad for Isaacs and Meaney while watching it. Wretched history written by someone ignorant of the subject and seethingly anti-Catholic as well.I never realized that Benjamin Franklin was the epitome of all human evil. Those wacky French."
5,Gorgeous,"This movie has the power to surround the atmosphere with the purest, most idilic of love one can ever experience in life. That is despite all the mundane feelings that the word ""love"" brings nowadays .... I cannot help myself .... This movie is what love means to me. Oh, and the music is divine! I am looking for it's soundtrack at this vey moment ..."
3,Confusing -could have been better....,"I took me a long time to get into this book. The political background is complex and Mr. Cook seems to relish in making the relationships among the various principalities (countries, states, towns??) and characters very very confusing. I suspect this may be purposeful, but I found it distracting. I have enjoyed the Black Company books, even though the background to the stories were rather obscure, but this new book did not rise to the level of those books.I finally just gave up trying to understand the background, and half way through the book it became more interesting, as it focused more on a few main characters and locations. Still, I had no idea who was fighting whom, what factions were joined, where the various locations mentioned were, etc.I'm not sure yet if I will try the next book or not...."
3,"I am his biggest fan, but....","It is just too complex. There are so many unpronouncable names, religious schisms, geographical areas, seas, islands and important famlies. There are historical incidents that bear on all the above. To really grasp what is going on you would need maps and you would need to treat the book like you would treat a text on Asian history if you signed up for a 5 semester hour class. I have everything Mr. Cook has ever published and have read the ""Empire of the East / October's Baby"" series 5 or six times. I like complexity, but this was too much. I plan to get the next book, but I am hoping for more story and fewer names."
1,Not as good as Black Company,"I read this a year ago or so and have to say the writing was good, but the themes were distasteful. Another reviewer here drew the parallels to the times of the crusades and it was apt. I knew as I read it that the inspiration was drawn from history.However, when I read that the ""christian"" leaders (using the correlation to history) were into pedophilia with little kids ... pleasuring ... them under the table while they talked to others was just a little too far out there for me.Really, I would say it made me want to vomit.Cook is a masterful writer, but this is one to avoid."
2,Unfocused and overwhelmingly detailed.,"I loved the Black Company series, so I bought the first two ""Instrumentalities"" books without a thought. That was a mistake. The principal characters are interesting, but the focus never rests on them long enough to fully develop the character. I forced my way through the first book hoping that it would improve, but it did not. The best comparison that I can give is that I felt like I was studying for a history exam."
2,Agree with Harvey Lewis,"I agree with the review of Harvey Lewis. This book is just too complex. I bought it last Christmas AND STILL CAN'T FINISH IT!!There are just too many names that fade into and out of sight too rapidly.I am not sure what Glen Cook was trying to do with this change in style, but as a loyal fan I was sorely disappointed in this effort.There are times when the book seems to gain traction and start to tell a story but then it gets lost again in forgettable history lessons and family trees.If I were anyone looking for Glen Cook's next creation after Black Company I would give this one a miss! Wait for George Martin's next instead."
2,I gave up,Congratulations to all who finished and understoodthe characters and followed the storyline.Tooo complicated for me. Too many places and people.I long for the simplicity and solid storylineof David Gemmell. So sad he passed away.
2,Impenetrable,"I've read and enjoyed a lot of Glen Cook's books so I thought I'd like this one too, but it's so badly written that I almost gave up on it. If you can get past the incredibly boring and poorly fleshed out characters, and the at times impenetrable walls of text that spring up throughout the book (you'll know them when you see them) then there is actually an incredibly complicated plot going on behind the scenes and it was just interesting enough that I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of only one. But if you haven't already paid for it like I did then you should do yourself a favor and not buy it. I think whoever put ""needs editor"" as a tag has the right idea."
2,Overly complicated,"I agree with many others here on the lack of coherence this book puts forth. Let me first state that I am a huge fan of the Black Company series. I have read them about 6 or 8 times over the last 20 years. Amazing. Also a big fan of Garret P.I.The problem with this book is that we are introduced to so many characters, and points of view that when a character comes around a couple chapters later you don't remember who he is. Especially since the names are very elaborate and yet similar. Also troubling is that each character does not seem unique in his storytelling. By the end of the book you have a sense of the main characters and protagonists but I can't say that you care enough about them to move to the next book. I really wanted to like this but fought through it the whole way. If you haven't read Cook before I would grab a copy of the Black Company. It is a phenomenal series"
3,"a big confusing mess, but still a somewhat fun read",I love Glen Cook's books but this latest series is a bit hard to follow. Maybe he's just establishing characters for a long series so I'm willing to give him the benefit of a doubt for at least the first two books or so.
2,The Tyranny of the Night,Complicated & boring church plots. Really not much development on the primary character through the first 54 pages. And the Patriarch lists are silly. Perhaps he should go back to the style in the Black Company.
4,all is full of love,"""All is full of love"" is a great song. Beautiful, and also my introduction to Bjork's music. I don't even know why I bought it. I'm glad I did, though.The album version is great, but is one-upped by the ""Strings version"" and the ""Video version"" (strikingly similiar to one another). The ""Plaid Mix"" is lovely and the mix by Guy Sigsworth is every bit as good as the others.One star is deducted for the ""Funkstorung Exclusive Mix"". This is not a dance song. It somehow works with the ""Plaid Mix"", but the additional music sounds for ""Exclusive"" are ugly and sharp. Buy this single anyway and just skip this track.The music video is also featured. Top notch."
5,Bjork does it again!,This is simply the most beautiful song ever. Not to mention the most amazing video to accompany it. This is a MUST HAVE!
4,Good single for a great song,"All is Full of Love has been one of my favorite Bjork songs, ever since I saw the remix that was done for the Stigmata soundtrack. This single does the song justice, with an eclectic list of tracks ranging from IDM artists like Funkstorung and Plaid to Bjork's collaborator Guy Sigsworth. I do enjoy most of the single, I especially like the Plaid mix, it is delightfully different. I do find the Funkstorung remix and the string remix a little lacking though, and that is the reason I give it 4 instead of 5. This shouldn't stop you from buying the single though, as it is most definitely worth the purchase."
3,I could see this making a cute movie...,"It was a pretty little book, took me about 20 minutes to read, start to finish. It's like a pop up picture book, only it's not for little kids.For me to care about these characters though, there needs to be some actual character development. I think they could make a movie along the lines of ""Like Water for Chocolate"", or ""Chocolat"", but as far as actual stories go, there wasn't much to it.Frankly, I think Pfaltzgraff did a great job developing the dinnerware. It's beautiful, and quite a bit nicer than the illustrations in the book. That's my opinion, anyway.This is more like a nice expanded version of a greeting card. And as far as recipes go, all of the recipes are for ""potages"" of various types. Nothing else."
1,Don't bother...,"I bought two copies of the book to give as gifts. Fortunately, my curiousity got the best of me and I carefully opened and read one of them. While the pictures are cute and cheerful, the characters and plot lack depth and substance. (and, yes, I greatly enjoy cooking) Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found the book to be a waste of both time and money. I am glad to have read the book for the sole purpose of saving myself the embarassment of giving it to anyone I know."
2,Waste of money,"I read the 2d of this series first. The art was much better, so I was very disappointed in this book. Not only does the story have no substance, neither does the ""art"". Save your dough!"
1,What a disappointment!,"Compared to Hodgson and Bantock, which this book is imitative of, this book is boring, non-creative, and the art, in my opinion, leaves a lot to be desired. I got it as a gift and wish I could return it."
2,not that impressed...,"I'm afraid this was a bit of a disappointment... I didn't find the story particularly original or inspiring, and its presentation through the artwork and production was pretty but not much more than that. The book also has recipes, but they are all fairly simple soups that I could find in other cookbooks, so this does not add to my culinary skills.I own the Pistoulet pattern of china, and that was the main reason I looked for this book and got it. I do love the china and its whimsical patterns and colors."
1,Don't Bother,Genesis Wave book 1 and 2 were excellent. I don't know what the author was thinking of when he wrote his 3rd book. He should have quit while he was on a roll.
1,Too Many Waves...,"The Genesis Wave: books 1 & 2 were two of the best books I ever read. So naturally, when I heard about book 3 I thought it would be just as good. But it was terrible! It's slow, boring, and off the subject. The Genesis Wave: book 3, seemed to me, to be more about Picard's love affair with a fake Romulan rather than the Genesis wave.I thought that this book was more along the line of a sequel to John Vornholt's Gemworld series (which was also a very good read). It's like he took the two book series and blended them together.I don't really recommend this book to anyone. I like John Vornholt, and the way he writes, but this book just isn't worth your time and money."
4,I liked it,Ninja She Devil is one of those Japanese movies that is a guilty pleasure. It's not high on ninja action and it's not high on acting. But what it does do is fill your appetite for sexy Japanese women.
1,Seriously Awful!,"I can't believe I waited 3 months on a library waiting list for this book. It is monumentally awful. The grammar, sentence construction...tragic. I lost 3 hours of my life thanks to this book. What a waste. Their is nothing likeable about the main character and that is evident from the start making the book a more difficult read. I should have read the other reviews before and saved my time."
3,Extremely light summer read,This book is great for those want a no-brain book. It really left no impression on me whether is it was a good or bad book. It was just kind of middle of the road chick-lit book.
1,"catchy title, boring book","what a boring, disappointing book.i love fashion, yet didn't want to finish bergdorf blondes i was that bored. i expected more from plum sykes as she's an oxford graduate and works for vogue. don't waste your time or your money, (...)."
1,SHALLOW GARBAGE,"I would give this book negative stars if I could. This is one of the worst books I ever read. It's shallow, superficial junk. A friend loaned it to me so I felt like I had to finish it. And I was APPALLED at the way the main character non-challantly tries to kill herself and then, woops, nevermind, let me go buy a dress. The way in which a serious matter was treated was disgusting. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Meaningless shallow characters with superficial plot. Save your money!!!"
2,Don't waste your time,"After attempting to read several insider tell-all books (a la Devil Wears Prada, etc.) I'm finally going to just admit that I don't like them, no matter how much publicity they get. It seems to me that these ""writers"" are just name droppers who like to pretend they're poking fun at the very worlds they're obviously beholden to. Give me a real story with characters I can relate to and empathize with any day over designer label-wearing ""it"" girls who think their story must be interesting to others just because they find themselves fascinating."
1,Can I Have My Money Back?,"Hype without the substance, and I'm not talking about a Brazilian bikini wax, which is what Peach Sykes should stick to writing about. Her characters are shallow and predictable, their language unintelligible. This isn't reading but hastily pasted email messages by a girl that gets by on with a good pair of shoes."
3,Light Read,"I bought this book at an airport, and it didn't catch my attention, so I put it down. Looking for a light read for my daily commute across London on a crowded train,I picked it up again. It is truly a fun, chick book. The thing that kept me going through the book was when is this chick going to get a clue. She FINALLY did get a clue, and the book ended on good note. So if your looking for a very light and fun read it's not a bad pick."
3,"Fun, fast and quite diversionary!!","Bergdorf Blondes is an entertaining read that is drenched in a lavish life style that is ""beyond""! From private jets, to waiting lists for the fashionista must haves, this story is full of humor, good natured satire and an unquenchable desire to reveal the good heart beneath the vintage Valentino gowns and the Southampton tans. It cajoles you with perceived perfection and then reveals the depth of these amusing characters without indicting them, a tricky accomplishment to be sure. Fun, fast and quite diversionary!!"
3,brain candy pleasure reading,"Bergdorf Blondes is a book about a self proclaimed popular NYC fashionista whose definition of a major crisis is a ripped Alexander McQueen cocktail dress. Despite endless Alicia Silverstone-like clueless drivel by the narrarator, the ""moi"" endears herself to readers as she struggles to meet the perfect husband in the dog eat dog world of Park Avenue self-obssessed botoxed heiresses. Needless to say, this book is light hearted, satirical and funny at times - fun read for a long flight (when you need diversion from real work)."
1,Really Annoying,"This book was totally transparent and boring. I did not expect it to be deep but other books in this genre (Sex and the City or any Candace Bushnell book) manage to be funny and intelligently written as well. The only reason this book got decent editorial reviews is because Plum Sykes writes for Vogue. But all they could say was that it was funny or charming. Yeah. Try insipid. I think ""Moi"" (Miss Sykes) is trying to emulate Cher from Clueless a little too much. Only, Cher was likeable. Come to think of it , I think this book is a bad ""Clueless"" rip-off."
1,This book is UN-READABLE,"As I began to read this book, I couldn't help but wonder if it was written by a 10 year old. The style of writing is so sophomoric and simple. I expected to subject matter to be inconsequential and fluffy (and it is) but the writing is just downright BAD. What a shame. I was anticipating a light, fun read like The Nanny Diaries. This book is horrible."
1,This is not a novel,"This is advertising. Sykes mentions every luxury brand in the world, adds a couple of vapid and boring characters, no plot, and she calls it a book. Well, the result is about as interesting as the phone book."
1,Insipid.,"The only thing that was remotely redeeming about this book was the fact that a friend loaned it to me, so I didn't have to shell out my own hard-earned cash."
2,Clueless meets Sex in the City,"If I like, totally, had like bought the book instead of like taking it out the library, I would be tres, beyond..."
1,Should get 5 NEGATIVE stars,"What is wrong with us that we put trash like this on the bestseller list? I don't know anything about the writer's connections but there is something wrong going on if a book like this gets published. There's literally nothing good about it. Well, perhaps the ending is good but I couldn't get that far. It's just a truly terrible book. I suggest you buy something, anything, else and hope that the author goes back to being a society lady or whatever she was before she got the idea that she could write."
1,boring and predictable,"Must be empty headed and wealthy to understand the fashion-speak in this book. The ""climax"" was so predictable, I had it figured out as soon as the character was introduced. I finished it, but it was 2-3 nights of my life that I won't ever get back."
1,Lamest book ever,"Oops, I thought this book might be cute, ala the ""Shopaholic"" books, or some of the other chick-lit out there. However, this was completely shallow, and in the first 30 pages that I labored through before donating it to the local thrift store, had ZERO redeeming qualities."
1,Boring and trite,"Rarely do I abandon reading a book after only a few pages, but it was certainly a temptation with this book. Somehow I made it through the first three chapters, then was defeated by the reality of nine more. Guess I'll have to miss how this one ends."
1,Who is responsible for graduating Plum Sykes?,"This ""book"" is so bad, I couldn't even finish it. All it will make you want to do is punch Plum Sykes in the face for bestowing this crap upon us."
2,Oh this book is tres beyond. . .vapid and boring,"I'm giving this book 1 1/2 stars with and extra 1/2 star because I didn't buy, but checked it out of the library. I understand that this is SUPPOSED to be satirical but it's just boring, dumb and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed were the bits about fashion and perhaps Julie Bergdorf's character. But the narrator known only as moi was a character I neither liked nor cared about. I was quite dissapointed that she ends up with a good guy in the end (come on, you couldn't have been surprised). If you must read this book (like some must watch Gigli or a train wreck), then don't buy it. But if you're smart, read Sophie Kinsella's shopaholic series. Now there is a main character with heart,brains and good fashion sense."
2,Bergdorf Blondes,This has to be the most superficial & tedious read ever. The characters were unappealing & not characters many could relate to. The story was boring with not a whole lot of substance. I wish I had skipped this read....
3,More Substance please....A brunette's review,"I got through half of this book. The writing in this book is weak and gets annoying quickly. The main character is very shallow, which is funny for about the first few chapters, but after that it just gets old. Plum Sykes should stick to writing fashion articles."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","Let me start by writing that I enjoyed other novels of this dimension (The Devil Wears Prada, The Nanny Diaries, I Don't Know How She Does It) but this book was incredibly dull. I can only imagine that it's getting so much press because the author is well known Vogue writer etc.. But the storyline was banal and the writing flat...mostly the storyline was dull as ditch water. I picked up this book because reviews & synopses made it sound frothy and fun, but it's not fit for even beach reading. BORING!!!!"
3,cotton candy hair dresser low-fat low-carb golden pastel fluff,"Pulling out the Chick Lit now. This cannot be officially considered a book, well, not to me anyways. Its just fluff. But REALLY FUN fluff. This book is a giant sugar overload, ll about PAPS (Manhattan shorthand for Park Avenue Princesses). All about extremely superficial people and their extremely superficial lifestyles and (very rare) thoughts. Very entertaining and wonderful if you're in New York and need recommendations on what hairdresser to go to, where to get this seasons (fill in the blank) etc etc. The book is very quick, takes you two days if you're lazy. The first time i read this was... ninth grade? I read it twice in a row."
3,Just a little cheesy,"This book was an over dramatization (hopefully) of what you'd picture Paris Hilton and her friends to live by. It's about a group of girls who are friends on the surface, but live a very strange, materialistic life. All the girls want fiancé's but only because it's in style and none of them truly intend to marry them. It's basically about a couple of rich girls shopping their way through life, not really working, and going through men - until, of course, the happy ending. It was readable but a little too cheesy and over the top."
4,Good for Audio,"I listened to this book on my iPod and the narrator was excellent. It had a Breakfast at Tiffany's feel. The ending was rushed and predictable, but overall, I really enjoyed the six hours. Very light."
2,No depth,"It is very funny in several parts but the fact that the narator never changed, kept falling for the same guys and got the great guy in the end disinterested me. She didn't deserve him, she didn't make you be on her side. The book was missing something deeper, we didn't get to get to know the character's true feeling. Was really superficial but i guess that was the point."
2,Can't believe that I spent $12.00 on this book,"I picked up ""Bergdorf Blondes"" by Plum Sykes because I had some money and I couldn't find ""The Devil wares Prada"" I should have saved my money! This book was totally uninteresting to me! I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I scared at the idea that people really live this way! There are many great chick-lit books out there, but ""Bergdorf Blondes"" is not one of them."
2,'Trash' novel that literally does belong in the trash,"I read just about every genre you can think of. Lately I've been into trashy, light and fun books like this one supposedly is. But it's not. It reminds me of Candace Bushnell's characters and plots but has none of the satisfaction and emotion that Bushnell brings. I rarely find a book to be a waste of time, but I got NOTHING out of it! I doubt i'll remember anything about it in a couple months because it is so completely unmemorable. My advice to Plum Sykes: use your education to your advantage, come up with some trash that we can love and not regret wasting our life on. So my point is, even though other books like Bushnell's are light and simply for fun, at least they stand out in their own genre."
2,Fair-haired Narcissism,"This is an amazingly drawn out piece of drivel. Three-hundred some odd pages of vanity, cattiness, and shameless self-love do not make for a good summer read. The preciousness of neurotic New York princesses wears off in the first hundred pages. Besides the constant annoying abbreviations, general snobby attitude, and brand name-dropping, the book is decent if you'd like to have a laugh at what our society has become."
2,"Not horrible, but not great","Okay I did actually kind of like this book. The only complaint I had about it was that all the name dropping of fashions and drinks, locations, etc. was a bit much. The overall story behind all of this was okay and even a bit enjoyable, but it just got lost in the ""hot"" and ""trendy"" names and designers that clouded it along the way. Good but be ready to look beneath the words sometimes. Wonder how long it took her to write this? A stroll down Fifth perhaps?"
3,From the suite at the Plaza....,"If you have ever wondered what happened to Eloise, Nanny, her dog, and the tortoise, look no further.Plum's ""moi"" is the eternally child-like Eloise, and its great fun to read!"
1,WAY too slow!!!,"I usually love the New York ""Chick Lit"" books. However, this one just seemed to drag on and on. I juct couldn't take it anymore and the book is still sitting on my shelf never to picked up again."
1,Oh Dear Lord...,"I actually felt like I was loosing IQ points in reading this. Now, don't get me wrong, I love ""Sex and the City"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and the like. However, this was just painful. It was given to me by a friend to read on a plane and I think my time would have been better spent sleeping or even staring out the window. The Characters are stupid and shallow, to the point where it's not even remotely funny. I was too busy wanting to slap the narrator to laugh at any puns. After getting off the flight, I picked up a copy of The Economist hoping my IQ could be salvaged. Do not waste your time on this dribble."
5,So much fun!,"I wasn't sure if this book would be brainless/dumb, but it was constantly entertaining and funny with an amusing protagonist. Wish there was a part 2! *I listened to the audio cd which really brought it to life!"
4,"light, cute, hilarious","after a bit of a slow start, it picks up and becomes very engaging. The euphamisims are hilarious, and I think part of the initial appeal when the book came out was attempting to figure out which real-life debs were being referenced. I was ignorant of any IDs, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment. It's cute and it has a nice, funny fairy-tale ending~"
3,Good beach read about young NY socialites (y.a.a.w.n.n...),"Not being a particularly clothes-centered gal (and all that that entails), it was kinda fun to read about this Bergdorf trust fund baby and her friend. They are not your average ""mean girls"" so I never felt like I, the reader, was being pelted with abuse (the way some other books of this genre can do). This is not a book to read for its plot; it is just fun to read about fashion, makeup, shopping, the NY socialite lifestyle. Not a book to brag to your friends about. But a good, easy, quick beach read."
4,It is what it is...,"While not the best quality literature one could probably immerse themselves in, it's a fun read. The characters are silly at best, and the storyline is simple and light. After a school year of reading textbooks, reference books, & journals, it's nice to be able to relax and read a pointless, fun novel. This book in particular is quite heavy on the name-dropping & the characters do all seem to be quite shallow, but I doubt the author was going for ""Sarah, Plain & Tall"" type characters here. Sometimes it's fun to get caught up in fun, unrealistic drama aside from your own daily life - and this is the book for it!"
3,Interesting....,"I've always liked reading novels that are basically social commentaries disguised as 'chick-lit' such as yes, the Candace Bushnell's, and the slightly more literate The Nanny Diaries. (I admit: I find stories set in the big industrial apple fascinating) This one was one of those, and it was all very well and interesting and slightly funny, but at the end of the day no, you cannot take it seriously, even if the characters *are* based on real people. (What vapid, vain unrealistic lives they do lead!) Borrow it from a friend or the library and read it on the beach while getting your tan. (Or under an umbrella with a fake tan) Will pass off quickly into the bargain bin at Borders."
3,"Silly, Amusing Satire","Silly, light satire. She's not being serious, people! I kept reading because I actually know someone like the Julie Bergdorf character in New York City. She says ""ewww"" about anything and everything and often seems to read books just because they are the ""latest."" She is always concerned about the latest and trendiest food, drink, and fashion item and what is in and what is out. So this book was illuminating and sort of amusing for me."
3,American Version of Shopaholic Series,"This book really reminded me of the Shopaholic Series, only the american version. A story of New York Socialite Girls and the ""troubles"" with their lifestyle and getting that perfect blonde color and going husband hunting. It was really a funny, fast read. A few choice words turned me off a bit, but overall the book was a light fun read, perfect for a summer beach day. A one time read only. Get it from the library."
3,Nothing Special,"This book sounded like a fun romp, but it has few high points. It's a little too silly for me, but then again, I'm not that into ""chick lit"" which I would definately classify this as."
1,Total waste of time!,"Yuk yuk yuk, what was I thinking, buying this awful piece of junk? I hated each and every character because of their shallowness, hoped for the better and it never came. Give me Sophie Kinsella ANY day, now THAT's real funny. It's sad to hear that this ""book"" is semi-autobiographical -- that means people actually DO live and think like Moi and her awful friends..."
1,Really Bad Book,"If this wasn't an audio book I doubt I would have been able to read it. Totally spoiled, boring rich twits with no lives populate this story. There was not one charactor that I liked.I do enjoy a chick lit book now and then, however this one was jusst bad."
2,Monotonous,"I was hoping this book was going to be entertaining, but alas, I was disappointed. There was no real protagonist/antagonist conflict other than the boring ""me against the world"" complex, which I find frightfully boring. The main character was not one that I could really connect with and I really didn't feel bad for her through any of her drama (it would be literary blasphemy to call them conflicts) which made reading this book relativly taxing. The main character got on my nerves with her constantly thinking that everything that was happening revolved around her. Like when she can't believe that people have the nerve to be happy and in love when she had just been dumped! That is just one example. As a final note, if you're planning on writing a story, make sure you name your main character. How am I supposed to relate to her if I don't even know her name?-not recommended"
2,"A little too shallow for me, but did have an okay story line","This as a very easy, light read. I thought this book was very humorous initially, but got very annoyed midway. I agree that this book is just lots of name dropping. So glad that I don't have to live in a world where it's all about names... how depressing. These girls have some major issues! Would I want to be a Bergorf Blonde? NO THANK YOU! I wouldn't waste my time with this book unless you just love chic lit. I will give the book credit as it did have a cute love story and I wasn't expecting the ending with Charlie."
3,You get what you bargained for,"I thought this book was pretty well done and well written. The characters are shallow and annoying, but realistically portrayed. I don't blame the author for the shallowness of the characters. This is the first ""chick lit"" book that I've ever read. I picked it up at a book store thinking I'd hate it but found the writing to be better than I expected so I bought it and read it in one sitting. Its not Anna Karenina and nor should anyone expect it to be but for its genre its pretty enjoyable."
5,EXCELLENT!,"I thought this book was extemely entertaining. If you like movies, fashion, and modern culture, this book is it! The name dropping of designers, movies, restraunts, hotels, and events is unreal. Very well written, and never a dull moment. It was utterly delightful!"
1,Bergdorf Blondes,"Not that I expected much from this book - the same way I did not expect much from the Devil Wears Prada, Trading Up and other so called chick lit books - but I felt insulted reading Bergdorf Blondes. The above-mentioned books at least attempt to be sarcastic and try to describe New York society life with an ironic and sometimes even bitter undertone. However, this read was unfortunately a complete waste of time as well as an insult to the reader. Chick/Glam lit can be great but only if the writer is capable of injecting some cynicism and irony in her writing. Plum Sykes clearly is not!"
2,bland- cannot relate to characters,"If you like reading about rich women who cry over shoes and other deep issues, then this book is for you. I was hoping for a connection of some sort. I was hoping that the lead character would show an underlying depth of character. I was sadly disappointed. This is definitly not a Shopaholic book."
2,Doesn't go anywhere,"If you think Paris Hilton's escapades are fascinating, this book will be right up your alley. I kept hoping something interesting or amusing would happen, but it never did. All frosting, no cake."
2,A good beach/plane read...but not much else,"This book was just okay. I bought it to read on a plane and it certainly passes the time. The story is rather predictable, the characters somewhat likeable, but the book is entirely forgettable. Much better reads in the same vein would be Bridget Jones or the Nanny Diaries."
2,Trying too hard,"First of all, I want to say that I enjoyed other books in the same genre (Nanny Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada, etc) but I found Bergdorf Blondes pretty boring, to be blunt. I didn't find Moi to be a very sympathetic or likeable main character, and Plum Sykes' attempt at being ""cute"" was a bit tiring (the constant mentions of ""going to Brazil"" made me want to puke). Throughout the whole thing, I felt as if Sykes was trying to write a sort of ""Clueless-in-Manhattan"" (I'm referring to the 1995 movie with Alicia Silverstone), but lacked any of that great movie's original wit. In addition, I don't think it gives any great insight into the world she is trying to portray (and I work at a fashion magazine and live in NYC, so am familiar with the types of women and lifestyle she writes of).Overall, a disappointment, considering the hype surrounding the novel and its author."
1,We get it...,"... you know all the luxury brands, the thread count of the sheets at the Mercer Hotel, and the name of all the fashionable (read expensive) places in the city. Too bad that's all you seem to know. You don't know how to create characters, how to make a plot interesting, or how to write.But let's give credit where credit is due: you must be the best self-promoter in the world because you managed, with zero talent, to get a book contract and a six-figure advance. Bravo, Plum Sykes."
1,Utterly vapid.... and not in a fun way.,"I wasn't expecting real literature, here. I was hoping for an effortless little bit of fluff to distract me for a spell. But frankly, this isn't even a good beach read. It's pallid and flat and lifeless and dull... It has no plot, it goes nowhere, and the characters are so tediously arrogant that I wanted to club them senseless with their own Jimmy Choos. I get the distinct impression that this is a talentless but rich and spoiled celebutante's attempt to write a thinly-veiled memoire. It had such potential to be a fun read, but it's as dull and soulless as ""Moi"" herself. Yawn. Glad I borrowed it from the library-- I'd feel ripped off if I had actually wasted my money on it."
1,First people up against the wall when the revolution comes.,"There wasn't one single character in the book who wasn't purely a waste of skin. And if this had been the point, then this could have been something great. But it wasn't the point. Moi-- antihero? Oh my God. So very very bad and unreadable. The only emotion that I took away was physical revulsion for the idea that there might be people in the world who find it okay to live this way.Seriously. It makes Stephenie Meyer look like high canonical literature. If this is any indication of the future of books, future academics will be offering graduate seminars in howTwilight's crisp prose style and astonishing characterization made it a beacon for quality in the early 21st century.(Okay, I was obviously the wrong reader. The person who gave this to me because she thought I needed more light reading seriously MISSED THE MARK. But really, I hated it so much that I can't possibly imagine who the right reader could be. Go readEmmainstead.)"
4,Juicy Read I Couldn't Put Down,"This book was so over the top that it was awesome! The main character's super-diva attitude was almost too much, but really it just makes you feel more grounded because you know you'll never be that bad. Any girl who likes to shop, enjoy drinks with the girls, or just wishes to fill her closet with the best brands and designer clothes will love it!This is a savvy and viciously funny trip into a glittery, glitzy world we sure wouldn't want to live in-but by which we're more than happy to be vicariously consumed for the length of a book."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book doesn't even qualify as a bad beach read. Shallow characters, poor writing, non-existent plot, forgettable dialogue, and improbable events. Even the ending is silly and predictable.The young women, who live in NYC, are borderline anorexic, or anorexic, insipid, and unsympathetic. The plot is simplistic (self absorbed silly young women want to find a rich husband). Finishing the book is only possible if you have absolutely nothing to watch on TV, nothing else to read, or if you have the desperate determination to finish it because you spent the money to buy it. Doesn't even deserve a one star rating."
1,"Fluffy, unrealistic junk!","This book has an incredibly annoying character named ""MOI"" which is awful enough...not an inspiring name. Moi's biggest problems are she has to complain about EVERYTHING in her Park Avenue lifestyle, where women must get their hair highlighted exactly every two weeks and god forbid if you don't wear the latest designer clothes, you are simply not worthy to walk this earth. this was awful...don't waste your money, pick up US Weekly magazine and you can read the same story btwn the lines!"
1,the worst,"I think that this was the worst of the ""chick lit"" books that I have ever read. Boring and dumb with characters that you neither care about nor like. I struggled through to the end because I had bought it in hardback; I only bought it in hardback because of the glowing reviews on the front and the cover was good. Don't fall for it. Not even a good beach read. Just boring and dumb. Read Sophie Kinsella for good, funny ""chick lit."""
4,Fun Summer Read,"Bergdorf Blondes is the perfect book for times when you just want to relax and not really think about what you are reading. This is a total fluff book but with a really cute story and fun characters. If you want something light to read in the airport, at the beach or just at home in your favorite chair - this is it!"
1,This book deserves negative 5 stars,"Painful, boring, poorly structured, laughable piece of literature(if you could call it that). Only to be opened by readers of Cosmo and other illiterates. This book isn't suitable for even the fluffiest, mindless reads.....it's horrible....STAY AWAY!!! Don't buy this book, if you feel like giving your money away, there are things called charities."
4,"Light, funny, and frivolous...","...nothing more, nothing less. If you want brain food, look elsewhere. If you want style, sparkle, and a vicarious walk in someone else's Jimmy Choos, then this is perfect."
2,Skip This One,I was very excited by the book's premise--love the title and cover--however the read left me short. The heroine wasn't easy to connect to. The Manhattan name dropping (legs feeling like strands of Da Silvano's pasta and eating a magnolia cupcake) became gratuitous. Did the author get a commission from Chloe jeans?A few cute moments but overall disappointing.
4,Fun Fluff!,"I'm sure the author had a lot of fun writing this light-hearted and...well...superficial novel and I doubt if she expected anyone to consider it a literary piece. The main character, who refers to herself as Moi (the reader never finds out her actual name) is a British transplant living the good life as the best friend of a filthy rich heiress who can't resist getting ""five finger discounts"" from the department store her family once owned.Wearing the perfect pair of designer jeans, having a certain type of facial peel, and traveling by private jet is what makes life worthwhile for the female characters in the novel. Oh, and to be told one looks ""simply ani"" an abbreviated form for looking anorexic is the ultimate compliment. It was all tongue-in-cheek, however and thoroughly enjoyable. I snickered, giggled, and laughed aloud often.So, if you want to lighten up a little and take a break from the complexities of daily life, this is the book for you."
1,So glad that I checked it out in the library!,"I totally agree with (reviewer)Leah Claire's critique of this waste of paper. I only give it one star because I can't give it a zero. Trust me no one here that critques this book is ""jealous"" of the lifestyle of the characters since one reviewer claimed that ridiculous notion. I'm a black belt shopper so the fashions didn't phase me. It really puts truth behind the phrase ""MONEY DOES NOT BUY YOU CLASS"" can you say PARIS HILTON???Plum needs to stick to writing fashion reviews. It took me about two weeks to get through this book because it was so boring and predictable. Definitely a library read not one to buy."
1,Tre's Dull,Name dropping and brand naming do not make a non-existent plot and dull characters into a witty and savvy novel.Worth the money? No way.Worth the time? Maybe as a study in amateurism.
1,Terrible!,"I was looking for something frothy as a summer read and stumbled upon this book. It was horrible! Who wants to read about a rich, beautiful, thinner-than-a-model protagonist who's biggest dilemia in life is which gorgeous semi-royalty guy she will date next? No thanks - I don't need that kind of escapism. If this story was intended to be satirical, it wasn't written well enough for me to pick up on that fact."
2,"Very readable, but ultimately lackluster and disappointing","I was in search of an enjoyable chick flick type book when I bought Bergdorf Blondes. Unfortunately, this book had all the trappings, but none of the heart. It was a very fast read, which is probably good because I would have likely put it aside otherwise. I did not feel the author gave us any real good reasons to sympathize with the main character/narrator. I am not sure why I kept reading until the end. Perhaps I was looking for her to get more real, or at least less superficial. Somehow it never happened. (Or might have kept readingbecause it made me happy to be married and no longer living in NYC!)Regardless, the lives of these girls seemed very pathetic and lonely. I prefer books where the main character has a goal greater than getting free clothes and rides on private jets. I did not root for the main character, I felt I was only watching her life from afar in fascination of its vapidity."
3,A so-so read,"I thought the book was good as far as shallow, girly books go. But not nearly as good as others. I never felt like I really got into the book. Some parts were plain boring and I was disappointed at the overly predictable ending. Not a bad book, but I would suggest reading Confessions of a Shopoholic if you're looking for a fun book."
1,Oxford Blues,"As an Oxford graduate and an English person I'd just like to apologise to you all for Plum Sykes and Bergdorf Blondes. No, that's all. We're really sorry."
1,Predictable and boring,"The problem with this ""book"" is that's it's about stupid and vapid people living in a world obsessed with vanity and fashion and material goods. Since I'm a sucker for the English sense of humor, and because I had read some funny lines in the reviews, I bought this thinking it would be a satire on a stupid world. But it's just boring. It's lucky to get 1 star from me.We shouldn't blame Plum Sykes ... she's smart enough to see how preoccupied we are and to make some money at our expense, but don't buy this if you care about characters in books, or if you think Sykes wants to make fun of her subjects. She IS the subject. She's MOI. She lives and loves the world she's writing about and that makes her blind to its faults. If fashion and celebrity are your thing, go on reading magazines like Vogue and People. But if you want to read a book, do yourself a favor and buy a real novel. This thing will just make you angry for wasting your time and money."
1,Bergdoff Blondes,"I was trapped at my in-laws with nothing else to read and I did finish this shallow novel about incredibly selfish people who learn nothing, change nothing and improve upon nothing. This is the first novel I have ever finished and sent straight to the recycling bin. I needed to save other readers from this extreme waste of time."
4,Run Vacation Read,"A quick, fun read that is perfect for relaxing at the end of the night. Not thought provoking at all, but good in a mindless kind of way."
2,Like a cupcake from Magnolia--,"--sweetly lacking in nutritional value. You CAN judge this book by it's cover--the little pastel illustrations of private jets and engagement rings depict precisely what lies within. It's a silly novel infused with a thick stack of fashion magazines. The references to brand names, thread counts, and NYC will not be lost on anyone who regularly reads magazines or watches E! entertainment television. It's funny--I suppose due to the proliferation of magazines, movies, and other books like this one, the exclusive and high-flying world of the Bergdorf Blonds feels quite familiar (even to a decidedly un-Bergdorf brunette living far from Manhattan). Only in America! Take it to the beach and tell anyone who questions you that it's a highly intellectual and wicked satire. I liked it and I'm not afraid to admit it!"
2,"Dumb, but Like a Train Wreck","I can only give a book one star if it was so dumb I couldn't finish it. I did finish Bergdorf Blondes because it made me hopeful. Hopeful that it would get better. Sort of Sophie Kinsella meets Candace Bushnell then they both get ripping drunk and write a novel on the cocktail napkins. It was missing all heart, all warmth, and anything else that would make you care about what happens to the characters at the end. And truly, if you couldn't see what was coming, you probably can't read the first line on the eye chart either. It's not even about Bergdorf Blondes! It's about the Blonde's best friend! If you feel the odd compulsion to read this book, get it from the library and spend your money on something that won't make you feel silly."
2,Bergdorf Blah,"Plum Sykes has penned what can only be called a disappointment. Beneath the fabulous Chloe jeans, Hermes Birkin and Alpha-beta peel is a plot as skinny as the very 'ana' (anorexic) Bergdorf blonde or brunette, as is the case of the main character. I had to give up the book a little more than halfway through, but not after exerting enough effort--a gazillion times--to plough through the one-dimensional, oh-so-predictable story. And here I thought Anna Wintour's recommendation on the jacket was worth its weight in Harry Winston diamonds. Could it possibly be that by being a contributing editor for Vogue, Plum has thus earned such gushing, 'perfectly pitched' remark from the iconic EIC?Entre nous, as the main protagonist loves to say, the book is tres ennuyeux. Better save your precious few dollars in the piggybank for a new Versace dress."
1,Unreadable,"I chucked the worthless book after reading 22 pages. Did a 12 year old write this ""book""? Seems like the ""author"" wrote whatever popped into her head without bothering with a plot. The main character, ""Moi"", was so vapid and annoying I counldn't stand it. I'm actually mad! I want my money back. The only redeeming feature of the book is its pretty cover."
1,Burn this book,"A total waste of time. Kept reading to see if it actually had a plot. It didn't. Characters started out vapid and useless, and never improved. Thought it would be a light, funny read...too light, not funny. I kept saying ""you should just stop reading this book...Who in the world wasted trees on this?"""
1,don't waste your time by reading this,"I'm usually into suspense and sci-fi but enjoy some chick lit sometime. I've heard about this book before so when I spotted it in a used bookstore for a dollar, it was a no brainer purchase.Well, to start with, I was bored to tears-I don't think I ever read anything so remotely uninteresting. Sometimes even if characters are not very likable, I can still enjoy the book. Not happening here-the only conversation you will read about is about how one of the main characters is suffering because she doesn't have a newest designer bag. I like designer bags as much as the next girl but there are other things in life besides that. Is Ms Sykes writing about her own life? Sure sounds like it. I really don't think I've ever read about such lame bunch of people so it must be real. If you are interested in fun and lighthearted chick lit book, DO NOT BUY THIS! Even a dollar is too much for this ""masterpiece""."
1,Euwww!,"I'm all for chick-lit (Sophie Kinsella or Marion Keyes anyone?) but this book is just ""beyond"" awful. I ended up skipping pages just to get to the end of it, hoping that it will get better as the story develops. Well, it never got better. The dialogue mimicks the way Paris Hilton speaks (think: Euwww! Bee-yond!! Like, totally) and the heroine just gets more and more annoying instead of endearing. I would not recommend picking up this book. Go with the likes of Cabot, Kinsella or Keyes instead."
2,Irritating,"Yes, this book is not meant for anything but casual beach-side reading. To compare Plum Sykes to Candice Bushnell is an insult. Ms. Bushnell's writing is brilliant and fun and her stories are merely peppered with brand name dropping, not the sole purpose of them. This book is little more than a list of brand names. We get it: Rich NY princesses like brand names. No one needed to tell us that. But the similes in this book border on the ridiculous: She ""was as excited as a Japanese tourist in a Louis Vuitton outlet store."" The non-stop litany of brand names and who was wearing who and where was just irritating. Save your money."
1,Unfortunately Bad,"As much as I adore the strange universe that is NY's Upper East Side, this book is just daft drivel, not even FUN drivel. There is no structure; it simply wanders around like an uninformed shopper, on and on and on. The episodes are linked together with little insider tip offs on where to get the best fake bake, where to get bikini waxes. Reading a copy of Vogue will give you more of a sense of narrative and structure, even content. Don't buy this book. Wait for another more intuitive, sensitive and skilled writer to depict this world in all of its high-fat riches, rife with Chloe jeans and Manolos, sure--but utter saddness and hope too--as it really is."
1,utter garbage,"I bought this book in an airport on my way to a seashore vacation. I had a few chuckles the first 50 or so pages but now am finding myself trying to force myself through it. I may end up pitching it into the ocean. the author is supposed to be a vogue writer? she sounds like she's 12, attempting to navigate the vapidity of a junior high school in-crowd. ridiculous, boring, irritating -- overall, utter garbage."
2,What happens when an unfunny joke is carried on too long,"The whole superficial, rich girl princess satire was really funny for 5 pages. However, it quickly grew boring and obnoxious. Other than a few funny one-liners, this book is a complete waste."
1,The cover is more interesting,"I had been dying to get my mitts on this, and it was truly a disappointment. It's hard to believe this gal writes for a living. I think I could have written something better. I want to point out something, to any girl who gets her hair highlighted (as Julie does by ""Ariette), there is no dye involved, and when the author states ""the dye was applied to her strands"" (or something similar), being the as savvy as she claims to be, she would know that BLEACH is applied to make hair blonde. These inconsistencies, even I know better.Please don't waste your money on this, there are so many sappy novels out there that are probably better. Plum Sykes isn't even blonde as is proud of this fact...whatever."
3,Entertaining,The book was good except the characters were kind of shallow and reminded me of Paris Hilton. It was an entertaining book nonetheless.I just hope that this book is fiction and there really are not women who are like this in NYC.
2,Had a hard time finishing,"I was on the waiting list for this book for months, and unfortunately for the author, I had just finished ""Skinny Dip"" before beginning Blondes. What a disappointment, I had a hard time even finishing the book and couldn't have cared less about the characters. Skinny Dip was so well written, Blondes was the opposite."
2,Predictable and a bit of a Bridget Jones rip-off,"I found this book interesting for about the first couple pages, and then it got to be a bit tedious, a bit of a yawner, and totally predictable. I'm not sure if it's aimed at 16-year-old girls, but it almost seems like the 2004 version of a Harlequin Romance. You know, superficial and with no big surprises or revelations...or thoughts. It was very reminiscent of ""Bridget Jones,"" as well as the much better written ""Trading Up"" by Candace Bushnell. I recommend borrowing it from the library, and not expecting too much. I will give it its props, however, in that the storylines were all nicely tied up."
2,Great for what it is...,"As a very homesick ex-New Yorker I can say that this book was what I was looking for. It was hilarious, sweet, and seemed like the author couldn't decide if a teensy bit of her wanted to live that way or if she was being sarcastic... It was probably a really fun book to write. Yay for Plum!"
3,just ok,"It was very funny in parts, but after about the first 100 pages the jokes start to stale cause they're all about the same things. It is possible to be empty headed and shallow and still be likeable, and I thought that was where the author was going with the character of ""Moi"" - but that really didn't go anywhere, and towards the end she is just annoying. There is absolutely no character development - between Zach and Eduardo and Charlie and god knows who else,it was hard to tell who was who. The ""love story"" between Charlie and Moi is laughable, her bumping into him everywhere is a little too much coincidence and I had to laugh out loud at the end when he said ""you were made for me"". That was cheesy to the extreme. I skimmed throught the last three chapters just to get it over with. The descriptions of the hotels and private planes and the park avenue princesses were pretty funny though."
5,One heck of a trashy novel,"I loved this book. I am the farthest thing on Earth from a ""Bergdorf Blonde"", but I laughed through the entire novel. It was a terrific and much-needed break. Plum Sykes is hilarious. It has nothing whatsoever to do with life as most of us know it. Not going to win any esteemed literary prizes, but does provide total escapism. The first fiction I've read in years."
3,Just ok.,"This book isn't exactly a literary work of genius, but it at least it's entertaining. The characters are all spoiled, self-involved rich girls, but their tantrums and mini-dramas are fun the laugh at. At times I actually found myself rooting against the ""heroine"" because she was so ridiculous that I felt that she deserved what she got. Having grown up in the midwest where no one's mother would ever allow such behavior, I found the characters antics to be a bit annoying rather than endearing. Like I said before, this book isn't fantastic, but if you want a light read, you could do much worse."
3,The Good Life...or is it?,"While I didn't embark on Bergdorf Blondes with the highest of literary expecations, I did expect to get a quick, enjoyable read. It did fulfill my simple wish. The two main characters, ""Moi' and her best friend Julie Bergdorf don't really defy stereotypical expectations. If anything, throughout the book the two perpetuate the ditzy heiress stereotype who go through life worried about how others in their ""circle"" will perceive their outfits, hair and break-ups with ""PHs"" (prospective husbands). While Bergdorf Blondes wasn't an instant favorite, it wasn't a complete waste of time. I'd recommend it as a beach read."
1,UGH - I'm returning it!,"I got through two of the most poorly written chapters I've ever read in my life. Closed the book and announced that I would be returning it. I have NEVER returned a book in my entire life. I wish I had also checked it out from the library and not wasted my money.Her thought process just seems to fall apart and her sentences wander. The two chapters I read appeared to be very shallow, self involved and ditzy.The sad part is that there are people who live like this. What a pity."
2,Boring and disappointing,"I wish I had read the reviews on this one and saved my money. I did read the whole book but it was pretty boring and predictable. I did not care about the main character at all, wondered exactly why she was a Bergdorf Blonde (it never explains where she got her money from). I heard they are making a movie from this book and I hope it will be more exciting. My advice is not to bother with this."
4,Bergdorf Blondes,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Slightly predictable, but for light reading very enjoyable. So, for those that want to spend their summer afternoons with a glass of 'bellini' and a good read, I recommend this book."
3,The basics about Bergdrof Blondes,"Many people say it's ""ditzy"". I believe it is supposed to be sarcastic and kind of making fun of the people who live their life like this. I picked up the book because A) I read about it in a magazine and B) I shop at Bergdof (but not like the characters!) At first I thought the book was written poorly. I got more into it and in the end...it was better than thought it'd be. It's not the best book, but it's something you'd read if you have nothing else to read....best for summer!"
2,Boring Even for a Fashionista,"As a chick lit-a-holic and Manhattanite, I was drawn to a book about fashion and love in the NYC. What I got was a collection of incidents about shopping, rich loser men and title hunters. The narrator, as well as the other characters are barely even two-dimentional and the plot is redundant where it isn't non-existant.I felt like the narrator was trying to poke fun at the silliness of her jet-set, designer lable lifestyle, but even her little jabs about other characters' superficiality was tepid. There were no epiphanies or even any sort of change within the characters' lives, and the romance was trite and seemingly without much feeling.I love literature, both serious and light, but I reccomend you save your money unless you really want to read hundreds of pages about highlights and pedicures."
2,Shallow but not much fun,"Like an overdose of ""E True Hollywood Story"" or Us Magazine, ""Bergdorf Blondes"" isn't as half fun as it's supposed to be. Relentlessly superficial with a strangely brittle quality, this novel promises bubbly fun, but delivers little but endless brand names, forced zaniness and a plot twist that's given away in the jacket copy. And for a book about carefree rich people, a queasy anxiety about money seems to pervade every encounter in the novel. Thanks, but I have enough money stress in my life to want to deal with it inexpertly rendered in fiction. Leave writing to the professionals, Ms. Sykes, and market your consumerist boy-craziness to Cosmo if you feel you must express yourself in print again."
2,Vapid fluff,"Although this book sounded like a fun, mindless beach novel, I found it to be a surprisingly tedious read. The barely-conceived plotline is lifted straight from Bridget Jones' Diary, but the main character, simply known as Moi, lacks the vulnerability, foibles or humor that made Bridget so endearing. The characters are so shallow and rendered so flimsily that I found it impossible to connect - or care - about any of them. I understand that the author was attempting to portray an environment of privilege by making brand and product references, but the name-dropping is so constant and overwhelming that it feels like the same joke told 3,000 times.If you're looking for a fun, smart, satirical read about Manhattan's privileged elite, skip this and read Wendy Wasserstein's Elements of Style instead."
2,Pointless and Plotless,"Now mind you, I loved ""Sex and the City"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"", and ""The Nanny Diaries"". Therefore, based on many good reviews, I figured that I'd enjoy ""Bergdorf Blonds"" as well. I didn't expect it to be a literary masterpiece, but a fun read. WOW, was I disappointed!The characters are as shallow as the paper they are written on. We never learn anything about their hopes, fears, goals, etc. All we learn is that they love to shop, and never do or think about anything else but shopping. Oh, and getting a fiance. Not because they want love and happiness, but because fiances are the hottest new accessory.I kept waiting for the main character to have one thought or feeling that was genuine and reasonable, only to be disappointed whenever she came thisclose to it and failed. Yes, there were some funny parts, and I enjoyed the lists, but all in all it was a terrible, one-dimensional read."
4,I liked it,"I thought this book was a fun, fast read. It's not terribly deep or meaningful, but if you want something to read at the beach or by the pool- this is it. Lots of fashion speak and girly stuff. I'd recommend it to a friend."
2,Losing Brain Cells,"I honestly would never recommend this book to anyone. I think that it is just a cheap rip off of Bridget Jones's Diary. Bergdorf Blondes makes you feel as if you're getting dumber as you read further into the story. I believe that the heroine is someone you are supposed to cheer for and is someone who is supposed to grow by the end of the story. However, I found myself constantly disappointed by how shallow she was. If you want a good Beach Read then read Can you Keep a Secret, the Shopaholic series, or of course Bridget Jones's Diary. DO NOT waste your money on this book!!"
2,Can't even finish it...,I started this last weekend and am so disappointed I will not be finishing it. Don't waste your money!
5,Tres Bien,"An entertaining and humorous read. How about that Charlie Dunlain turning out to be the 'little earl'? I just knew it! Since the moment Moi met Charlie I felt that they would wind up with each other. How right I was! Actually, the 'little earl' thing is similar to the 'Ethan Miles' thing in the movie 'See Jane Date'. Jane(Charisma Carpenter) is unlucky in love and her aunt(Linda Dano) tells her to go out with the nice 'Ethan Miles'. In the end Jane finds out that the guy she knows and likes is actually Ethan Miles. Just like Moi's mother telling her to give the 'little earl' a chance, which Moi does. Great read, recommend it to those who love fashion and romance."
1,Don't Bother,"This book is a drag. The description says the main character is a heroine. Now, I would imagine there would be some redeemable or mildly interesting quality in a lead character to be called a heroine. Yet there is nothing endearing or interesting about her, she is a bore. Writing about pretentious rich people, and exposing their ironies and hypocrisy is a worthy undertaking, however this does not do that. Instead, the writer seems to lack an awareness of how really dull and sad these characters are and rambles on and on about their trivial lives."
5,page-turner,"This is my second Fanning book and I couldn't put it down. I didn't read any other books (or see the film) on the case but I did watch some Court TV coverage. How many staircases does it take to see the pattern of a cold-blooded killer? Typos aside, I thought it was very well written and it held my interest."
3,"Good Read, But Not Exceptional","I have been fascinated by this case ever since seeing it on one of those night time news-type shows. I have watched the CBC documentary, interviews and have read two books on the case. I feel that the other book (by Aphrodite Jones) is far superior to this one in details and the actual process of the trial (the actual trial is barely covered in this book it seems).Ms. Fanning is a good writer in that she is very ""easy"" to read so if you are just looking for light true crime reading this could very well appease you. For more thorough details, check out the other book. One thing that bothered me about this book were two typos (""hes"" for has, and ""pursue"" for purse) which makes me wonder - who was the editor for this book?"
4,Results on found condom,Just finished the book. It was good although Aphrodite Jones' book was more interesting. To answer the question about the found condom. I read that his son admitted that it belonged to a friend of his. Apparently his friend and a girl had sex on Michael and Kathleen's bed!
2,So-so,"Even though I think Peterson killed the two women, the author let her bias show throughout the book. She also introduced information and then didn't follow up on it, like the used condom in the bedroom, the rape kit performed on Kathleen Peterson, etc. What were the results of those tests? I got the feeling that she just watched the trial on TV, read some articles, and then wrote the book. I lot of typos, too."
3,Written In Blood,I enjoy true crime stories; however this one didn't have quite the story line that held my attention. I've read other Diane Fanning books and this one didn't seem on the same par as the others. Not a bad book just didn't have the impact I thought it might.
4,More informative than the documentary.,"I did not want to read this after seeing the documentary, but I am very glad I did. It did not focus so much on Peterson's sexual orientation but on the facts. Very well written. Peterson is right where he needs to be, locked up."
5,Couldnt Put It Down!,"I ordered this book from Amazon after reading other books by this Author. I LOVED it,She tells the Story of novelist Michael Peterson who murdered his wife and made it look like she fell down the stairs. Strange thing it had happened 16 years earlier to another women he knew!The Author did a wonderful job of telling this story her book was straight forward and to the point.It had no annoying filler in it.but,told the whole story.I got my copy in the mail one morning started reading that afternoon and couldnt put it down until I finished!Its an easy read and doesnt flip flop from subject to subject.Its one of the best True Crime books I have read in a while and I read them all! For those of you who watched this case on Court TV I highly recommend that you read this book as it has some facts I didnt see in the trial..For those who didnt watch the trial..Read this book! Its Great!"
3,Disturbing true crime,"This story is interesting, but disturbing. The writer makes a good case that the perpetrator got away with eliminating one inconvenient woman using a ""fall"" down the stairs, so went back to that method when he decided to trade in his wife for the insurance money. The reason I don't rate this higher is that the writing is not great. The story is told by jumping from present to past repeatedly, including the origins of some of the main characters, and I found that hard to follow. I did like that the points of view of several characters are shown."
5,Pop Splendor,"Took me awhile to stumble upon these guys, but am I ever glad I did! They've become one of my favorite bands of all time. ""Honey Bee"" is my favorite of their four albums (although I like their three eps for Hut a lot, too). This album is so subtle and charming, stuffed with odd moments of light-handed production and self-deprecation, lovely melodies and off-kilter harmonies...Moose is a great band and this album captures them at their best. ""I Wanted To See You To See If I Wanted You"" should have been a radio hit."
3,Okay,It was just okay... It did not pop with that country feel like she looks.......if that makes since.
3,Great book but don't waste money on a reading with author!,"I found the content of the book to be well-done and the exercises both helpful and entertaining. But, I must give the book 3 stars as I have had a reading with the author and found it to be wildly innacurate in terms of predictions. She may be a better writer than a psychic....don't waste money on a reading...buyer beware!"
3,"Cool book , well-presented...see caveat below..","I purchased this book about a year and a half ago. I found it to be well-packaged in terms of content with enough ""hipness"" to it to attract the Gen xr's but not so much that other audiences could not appreciate it. I gave the book 3 stars as I did get 2 readings from the author and while at the time they seemed fine(not exceptional), NONE of her predictions came true. It was most disappointing as she gave me very specific info that I taped and wrote down(ie., names, dates, etc..) I am not sure if I want to use the tools of an author, that in my opinion,has little psychic prowess of her own, to learn how to be psychic and tap into universal energy. Buyer beware!"
1,terrible book,This book makes power electronics needlessly complicated and is not even written well. Examples are useless because the equations used are poorly explained. Sometimes variables are used with no explanation of their meaning.
2,Softcover stinks,This is a softcover book with low quality black and white images inside. You might as well save a bunch of money and get an international edition because that is what this one looks like. Amazon also lowered the price right after I bought the book. Really disappointed with this textbook purchase.
3,Romantic Motivation - Zero,"The only problem I see with this story is a whopper. The hero and heroine have next to nothing in common and many reasons to dislike each other, but to paraphrase the hero's own thoughts, all the heroine needs is a sexual encounter with him, and she'll come around and love him. And sure enough, that's how the story unfolds. Against her wishes and the wishes of her people, and with all the romantic finesse of a codfish, the hero forces her to marry him (although he's made it clear he suspects she murdered her previous husband), and essentially wins her over with a satisfying shag. I'm sure there are romance novel readers out there for whom this is enough, but I expect more out of the author, especially as I've seen her turn out much better work."
5,The best formula you can get for money,"This formula is has a great value! It's much cheaper than the big brands (like Nestle Good Start, Enfamil and Similac) but the quality of the product is compareable.Our 5 1/2 week old boy is doing very well with Bright Beginnings. We switched from ""Nestle Good Start"" to ""Bright Beginnings"" when he was two weeks old.I really can recommend Ultra Bright Beginnings if you cannot feed with breast milk."
2,what a disappointment,"I knew going in that this handbook was for commercial growers so though I hesitated at the price I thought it would be worth it because it would be so complete. Boy, was I mistaken. I can't believe this is what professional growers use. The information is so hit and miss.I guess the biggest problem is the inconsistency about which vegetables and crops are covered. In some places they list every vegetable you can think of and in others they list fewer than 15. Need to know what temperature to ship vegetables or how much a crate of yucca weighs? There are pages and pages devoted to it. Need to know germination temperature for seeds? There is less than a page and exactly 12 vegetables listed.I think most growers [even commercial ones] would be better off searching out the information they need for the specific crops they plan to grow. In fact, much of this book is dedicated to listing websites and government agencies rather than including the information."
5,Knott's handbook review,"Very comprehensive but somewhat esoteric. This handbook is not for casual reading, but yields results for specific research. The more the book is consulted, one has a better understanding of how the information is presented. The handbook contains a wealth of material."
2,Knott's Handbook For Vegetable Growers,"The book has valid information, but I was seriously disappointed. I think the book is way too expensive for the contents, which are quite brief. You may want to visit a Public Library and look at a copy before you invest in this book. The US Dept of Agriculture Books might be a better find for your interests in Vegetable Growing. Good Luck"
3,for chemical farming,"After many years of hearing about this book in different publications,I finally purchased it.1. It is much smaller than I thought for the price2. it contains many useful charts on days to maturity of various crops, yields and other great reference material that I see in bits and pieces in seed catalogs.3. It looks like about 25% of the book is dedicated to the practice of using pesticides and herbicides. As an organic farmer, this is not relevant.4. It would be great if an organic edition was made available.5. It will be a resource sitting on my shelf for occasional use only."
4,The Musicality of Ivor Novello,This an excellent show-case of the music of Ivor Novello. The singing on practically all of the tracks is of a high standard. My only gripe is that there are only 12 tracks. I appreciated the service provided by Amazon. The CD arrived very promptly at my address in mint condition.
5,Electric Fisherman,"My parents owned one of these for almost 20 years before it finally died. They ordered a new one and it works just as great as the last one! We use it on anything...of course fish, but also roast, ham, turkey...i think you get the point that the electric fisherman is one of the best electric knifes on the market! I definitly recommend it!"
1,won't cut meat,"Our electric knife died. Bought this at WalMart the day before Thanksgiving. It wouldn't cut the turkey. Tried again tonight. It wouldn't cut the raw meat my wife was preparing for the chili. It is a piece of junk. May be great for fish, but it will not do what electric knives normally do. Avoid."

Amazon, keep your pricing promise to your most loyal customers, the Kindle owners.Whoever came up with the changes to the epricing policy is not concerned with the continued success of the Kindle philosophy."
4,Guardian of the Dawn,This was another good historical fiction by thisauthor about the plight of Jews in 1500's era Portugal.
1,Maytag Customer Service,"Recently bought a range, microwave, washer and dryer from home depot. After about one and one half years ALL four quit working. Called customer service, that was a joke, one-year warranty of course, will never buy from maytag again. Feel free to contact more dissatisfied customers if you like, there are many out there, and all will attest to my comments. $2000 is a lot to spend on appliances that will only function for a little over a year. May just be a fluke, zero out of four ain't bad right? Oh, wait yeah it's absolutely terrible."
3,Mutton dressed as lamb,"I'm having a hard time with this series. I like the author's style of writing, but I really can't stand Sam and Gabe. Sam is a shallow dingbat who, for some reason, finds dressing like a tacky hooker empowering. A woman can look and act sexy while still acting her age. Gabe is an arrogant jerk who uses sex as a substitute for dialogue. And SURELY he can call Sam something other than ""Babe"". The supporting cast of characters are far more likeable. It's an enjoyable, predictable, light murder mystery, if you can stomach the annoying main characters. Check these out from the library, and save your bookshelves for a series worth keeping."
2,Stephanie Plum wannabe,"While this book has, by far, one of the best titles I've seen in a long time, I can't say the same for the rest of the book. Rife with one-dimensional characters and rip-offs from the Stephanie Plum series, Ninja Soccer Moms should have been benched. And there should be a federal law against using ""Omigod!"" more than once in a book -- unless it's an Archie comic."
1,Barely worth the expense,"This toy is cheaply made and is not worth the price. I wouldn't take another one for free. My kids lost interest in this ""glider"" almost immediately. The head broke partially off about as fast."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased three of these. The plug didn't work on one, which turned out to be ok because I connected to another one. After about four uses, part of one of the ropes went out. I wouldn't recommend these."
2,Rope lights,Returned since 1/3 of the lights didn't work. The return process was just fine though. I might be willing to try again.
1,Defective on arrival. I have to pay to ship it back!,Defective piece of garbage! The plastic on the end of the lights was warped (egg shaped) and would not connect to the power cord. With shipping the refund would not be worth it. Will just have to modify them to make them work
1,This one failed too,"I bought the 24 foot Good Earth rope light for outdoor use along our deck and a 12 foot for indoor use plus I've also had another 12 footer from Good Earth Lighting in the past as well.After a while these rope lights fail. At first it will be a small section which sometimes you can rescue and get back online by jiggling the rope but soon, though, whole sections will fail in about 1-3 foot lengths randomly along the rope. It doesn't matter if it's placed outdoors or in, every single one I've purchased has failed within a year. This proved to be especially problematic on our deck where the 24' was tucked away in areas that will be hard to reach to remove it.I cannot recommend this brand at all. If you buy one it may work for just long enough to be beyond the warranty or Amazon's great return policy but they will fail. I'm now looking at water-proof SMD LED rope light strips which are low enough in price to compete with these unreliable rope lights.Avoid!"
4,"Great light rope, with terrible mounting hardware","I purchased this light rope to provide ambient lighting around my desk workspace. I'm very happy with the rope itself, which provides a warm glow and is conveniently designed so that you can plug an additional rope light as an extension.However, the mounting hardware - plastic clips that you attach to your mounting surface with the included metal screws - is too flimsy to hold the rope for very long. In my case, 4 out of every 5 clips broke within six months. As an alternative, I bought 3/4"" brass screw hooks (they look like an upside-down question mark) from the hardware store to replace the broken clips. In short, the light rope is a great lighting accent for the price, but skip the included mounting clips when you're ready for installation."
4,good but not as bright as expected,"I saw an article about using this for under counter supplemental lighting. Well the photos must have been long exposures because these are truly not adequate for lighting a work area.They are wonderful for subtle light in a room though.Part of this intermittently fails to stay lit unless I jiggle the thing around, so there is some type of loose connection inside it.Over all nice product. Can't blame the product for my unreasonable expectations."
2,Poor quality product,"The screws provided with the product are terrible. The first two I tried sheared off so I went out and bought some similar ones from the local hardware store. For the record, I was not using power tools and I was trying to use the screw in plywood, nothing terrible hard. So definitely low quality screws.After I put the light in, one quarter of it just stopped working.. again shoddy quality control.The only positive things I can say are that the price was low and the color of the light was similar to incandescent bulbs, so warm light, not the bright white light that hurts your eyes."
3,Good ambient lighting,"This is good for decorative lighting, to illuminate a dark corner or shelf, but it is not bright enough to light up a whole room or to read by -- it's more like a nightlight, just bright enough to keep a room from being totally dark, but not a replacement for lamps or overhead lights."
2,12' rope light,"Don't waste your money unless you want something just to look at. Since it was LED lights, I expected more light. A 7 watt night light bulb puts out more light than this piece of junk."
2,Not very bright,"I ordered this to put into a gun safe, and it doesn't put out much light at all. It works, but thats about all I can say good about it."
3,Not feeling it,"I was so excited when I ordered this book becaue of all the good reviews it received, but Caught Up was not what I expected at all. First of all, the sentences and paragraphs were too choppy. The author seemed to just focus on breasts and behind throughtout the story. It was aight, but I wouldn't recommend it. I shouldn't even give it a 3."
2,I Didn't Get Caught Up,This book was not as good as I thought. There was no real drama and the book percieved HOTlanta as COLDlanta. Nothing really went on in the book that might have separated it from the others. The characters were lukewarm and the storyline was like a low budget movie.Later!!!!
4,"""GET AWAY""","THIS BOOK WAS GOOD,I READ THIS BOOK IN JUST EIGHT HOURS.WINSTON CHAPMAN DID A VERY GOOD JOB ON THIS BOOK.THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL NAMED RAVEN,RAVEN IS A BI-RACIAL FROM IOWA.WHEN RAVEN GETS TIRED OF BEING THE ONLY BLACK PERSON LIVING IN DES, MOINES SHE DECIDES TO LEAVE THE TOWN AND MOVE TO ATLANTA TO START A NEW LIFE,ON HER WAY TO ATLANTA,SHE MEETS HER SOON TO BE FRIEND NAMED NIA AND RICO,NIA AND RICO INTRODUCE RAVEN TO THE ATLANTA LIFE.WHEN RAVEN ARRIVES IN ATLANTA SHE BEGINS TO EXPERIANCE NEW THINGS...RAVEN,NOW AS SHE LIVES ATLANTA IS NOW A MANAGER OF A STRIP CLUB AND IS RUNNING THINGS.RAVEN HAS MANY LOVERS ,AND IS CONFUSED AND WONDERS HOW SHE GOT HER SELFIN SUCH A SITUATION...WILL SHE SURVIVE IT?THIS BOOK IS A GOOD READ"
3,mildly interesting,"The book was alright. I only say this because i felt that the author had a formula of introducing or describing a sex act every other page. I think the author should concentrate on the erotic books genre. Ignoring the sex, the book had an amusing story-line."
2,Caught Up,"I wasn't caught up in this book. i just couldn't believe the story,unrealistic, badly written. i mean come on, you wanna brag about how fast you can write a book? 60 days is good? next time write a decent story and don't waste my money."
3,Tell me,"I don't remember the series, but we are HUGE collectors of all that is Las Vegas, especially before the original casinos were imploded. Tell me, are there lots of shots of the old strip? Thanks."
2,62 dollars for a season!,I really want to own the full vegas series! I have them on VHS off TV but would like them professionally done on DVD. But 62 dollars a season is ridiculos. Be reasonable on price and I'll buy all the seasons. Waiting and hoping for sanity to kick in. Hoping Spenser for hire series will come out soon too!
5,Las Vegas Fan,Finally! I have been waiting for this old tv series to reach DVD. Watching each episode is like being in Las Vegas. I love this DVD!
4,Vegas Season 1,Great Series. I watched them all on TV but had forgotten all the cameos by other stars. Some weren't stars until after this show.Could do without Binzer but you can't have everything.
3,A review From my point of view,Yu-Gi-oh Reshef of destruction is good but the main problem is its is sooooooooooooooo HARD you have RUBISH cards with 900 atk and LESS and the oponents have cards with 1500 atk and up! the start of the game is pretty easy though but the rest is IMPOSSIBLE i have had the game for a YEAR and i am not even HALF WAY though the game!
4,THIS GAME SUCKS,"This game isn't worth the money you'd end up payin' for it. The only real reason to buy this game would be for the promo cards. If you want a real good Yu-Gi-Oh game, get the World Championship Tournament 2004 game."
4,Not Bad,"THE ONE MOST HATED THING FOR ME IS TRIBUTING I HATE TRIBUTING but that is just about the only bad thing besides the fact that you can only win when you get lucky, like when I summoned 2 eygyptian god cards at once on a glitch and still barely won(btw I have only senn one glitch I would deafinatly buy this game"
4,Challenging,A game everybody should buy to challenge theirselves to the game of duel monsters. I really enjoyed it. Good luck.
2,HARDD,"As a prequel to the Sacred Cards, i was expecting a lot. But this game simple didnt deliver. Firstly, The Gameplay is twice as slow, as the AI seems to review its options every time a monster is summoned or attack, basically every time a trap card could be played, wasting like 1 second 5 times every person's turn. That would be ok, if the gameplay was as good the Sacred Cards too, but this game is just not fun. Its wayy too Hard, and you find yourself grinding for hours just to get enough to buy one new crappy card with 900 ATK points. Literally the 4th required duel in the game, the other guys monster average twice your power, (1400 to 700), so you're stuck training endlessly on the nearby drones. BUT, the redeeming factor of this game is a cool storyline like the Sacred Cards. Its just I haven't been able to see any of it yet."
2,Not my type of game,"It was not like any game i expected. I was wanting a regular Yu-Gi-Oh game, and it wasn't a regular game."
3,"Love the idea, but execution lacks severely","This is a good idea for a game. I got it when it came out. The idea of having a sequel for Sacred Cards is fine. Yet the execution leaves alot to be desired. The starting deck is definitely for beginners and is difficult at first against the more advanced people in the game (Kaiba (if you could duel him straight away), Rebecca (she's a brat anyway), and at first Duke). You can't get decent cards to start with simply because you have to earn the cards. That's fine. If you could walk in with cards like Jinzo in your beginning deck, the game would be beaten in 15 minutes. Card effects are also changed. Along with this garbage about types. Or whatever Konami wants to call it. If you are wanting a game that follows the true TCG rules, this is NOT for you. If you just love Yugioh, then collect it. The cards that come with it are worth the price alone."
5,it'll be mine soon,"I'm getting this game for christmas! Along with a GameBoy Advance SP onyx. I've seen some screenshots and i gotta say I'm impressed. And the promo cards are also great, since I got a Dark Magician deck. I always liked the Yu-Gi-Oh! games and pokemon, but pokemon had something Yu-gi-Oh! didn't, RPG features, but then The Sacred Cards came out, the first Yu-Gi-Oh! game with RPG features, with graphics way better than any Pokemon game. A year later came reshef of destruction the sequel to the Sacred Cards, with better graphics than the Sacred Cards and any Pokemon game. If you're a Yu-Gi-Oh! fan i recommend you buy this. I know I will. Below is my christmas list:1.- GameBoy Advance SP Onyx2.- Yu-gi-Oh! reshef of destruction"
2,Reshef of destruction,"From my opinion, this is not a very good game. First of all, the duelists are waaay too easy. 2.You have to pay 1000 zenie in the game to enter a card into the game, if u mess up the numbers you dont get the money back."
5,Good for serious fanatic,"A slightly different sound engineering compared to PETER GABRIEL IV (at least it was on the LP). Minus-one tracks sound tighter with enhanced high bands. One subtle thing enjoyable is the altered phrasing to carry German verses, which well demonstrates the artist's cliche of the time."
1,DEFACING HOLLY'S BEST WORK,"There is no mention of The Picks on the album cover posted here, but this is listed by Amazon as ""Buddy Holly and The Picks"".If this is with the Picks you should know that...There is no ""best of"" Buddy Holly with the Picks...For some incomprehensible reason, around 1985-90 someone in authority gave license to a group called the Picks to overdub any and all original Buddy Holly recordings with their vocal harmonies.These modern overdubs of Holly's 1950s classics deface his finest work, and are widely distributed as ""Buddy Holly and the Picks"".As result, there are surely a lot of people out there who think Holly's band was the Picks, and that Holly and the Picks were not very good (they're not).Buddy Holly was an exceptional artist. Treat yourself to the real thing."
1,The very worst of Cruddy Holly,"I was so looking forward to getting rid of my old cassette of Buddy Holly and upgrading to CD. So, after ordering this CD, I did. Huge mistake! This release is a prime example of remastery at its very worst. Some idiots have ruined most of Buddy Holly's old original masters with some hick overdubbing that falls short of really bad drunken karaoke or ""The Singing Bee"". When I played this disc, I immediately renamed it The Very Worst of Cruddy Holly. DO NOT BUY this CD from anyone at any price. I recommend you buy an old LP or Cassette that preceeds modern technological vandalizm."
2,Less than impressive,"Well, first off, my boys (2 and 7) loved the DVD. Thetwo main characters, Marty and Gerard, were a hugehit, and they loved the silly stories. On the other hand,I thought the DVD was less than entertaining, and I totallymissed the Bible-based lessons. The important stuffwas just lost in all that silly!I was really shocked at how little I enjoyed the movie.After all, I still laugh at the VeggieTales movies we'veseen a million times. This series just doesn't even comeclose, and I don't see myself buying the next in the series.(I received my copy free from Booksneeze.)"
3,"Cute Concept, Does Hold Their Attention","There are 3 different stories included on this DVD. As a mom, I like the cartoon style, and the bright colors which keep my girls attention. And since each episode is less than 15 minutes long, my girls' attention won't sway from the story in front of them.Both of my girls were interested in the stories, and my 5-year old really liked the giraffe. My 7-year old ""likes that they've been silly all the time"".This is a DVD we'll take in the car with us for longer trips. It will break up the movies since they don't have to pay attention for a long time.Personally, I didn't enjoy the stories. They just didn't capture my attention or make me understand the lessons."
2,Very Vague,"I've gotta say, one of the big draws for me with this DVD was that the stories were based on Jesus' parables. I envisioned great conversations between me and my kids that led us to dig into the Bible for insight and instruction. Um, notsomuch. Honestly, if the parables weren't mentioned at the beginning of each segment I hardly could've guessed what they were referring to...or that it was even content taken from the Bible! There is also a lot of cartoon violence (think Tom & Jerry) that is entertaining to a 5 year old, but pointless.On the flip side, my son really enjoys this DVD for the good, clean fun that it is. And although the content isn't as spiritually driven as I'd like it to be, I can let him watch it without being concerned that he'll see or hear something inappropriate."
3,Lacking a bit...,"While I found this entertaining and cute. While the cartoons did correspond with the verses mentioned above, I didn't find much Biblical truth in it. There was no discussion about Bible truths in the movie. We did sit down and talk to my two children (mainly 3 year old since she understands more) and shared the similarities of the movie and the Parable. My 3 year old and 1 year old really liked the movies (the characters were fun, bright, and kept your attention). I did however think that they shared good moral principles and I would let my kids watch them again.I received a free copy of this movie from Tommy Nelson (a division of Thomas Nelson Publishing Company) via Book Sneeze for the purpose of reviewing."
2,Adventures in BoogaBooga Land,"Join Marty the Monkey and Gerard the Giraffe, two zany best friends, as they embark on three adventures. Each episode is 15 minutes long and presents one the parables of Jesus.Episode 1. So this is Booga -Parable of the Workers in the VineyardEpisode 2 : Marty's Sandcastle - Parable of the Wise and Foolish BuildersEpisode 3: No Light in the Lighthouse - Parable of the Lamp under the BowlThis video lacks any real substance and Jesus is not mentioned other than it says on the cover that the stories are from the Parables of Jesus. I watched this video with my 5 year old daughter and she thought it was okay, but admitted it's not her favorite. I was not impressed with this video. I don't think it stressed the lesson of the parables and it is a loose interpretation of each story. It is good for entertainment, but not for teaching the Bible. I would suggest for ages 5-8."
2,Adventures in Booga Booga Land - Stories from the Parables of Jesus,"I was excited to receive my copy of Stories from the Parables of Jesus, but very disappointed when we watched it. The three stories include main characters Gerald the giraffe and Marty the monkey. The stories to parallel the parables, but there is no explanation of the parable - just the story. I felt this resource was really lacking in teaching children the meanings of the stories.The three episodes and parables on the DVD are:1. So this is Booga - The Workers in the Vineyard / Matthew 20:1-162. Marty's Sandcastle - The Wise and Foolish Builders / Matthew 7:24-273. No Light in the Lighthouse - The Lamp Under the Bowl / Matthew 5: 14-16I received a free copy of the video in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
1,Wrong Measurments Listed,"Item info lists the ironing board cover at 65"" long. It is only 49"" long, just as it is written on the ironing board cover packaging. Very disappointing as I have had great difficulty finding a cover for my very long ironing board. Otherwise, if it had been long enough, the padding and construction is superior."
1,Rowenta ZD6020 Expert Ironing Board Cover,"Extremely poor quality. The very first time I put the ill-fitting cover on the ironing board, the cording broke as I tried to tighten it. Now I'm stuck with an absolute mess. DO NOT PURCHASE. In fact, do not buy any of their ironing boards as you cannot find a regular-sized cover to fit them, and consequently you will have to pay much more for a Rowenta cover."
5,Ironing board...very nice,Purchased this ironing board after doing much research. I am really happy with it. Very sturdy and height is easy to adjust. Lots of surface space. If you have small area to iron ....you may want to make sure its not too big.I would recommend highly.
3,Tommie in Florida,"I had ordered the ironing board. It came with the cover on it. Loved the board - a little heavy but adjustable height, rack, place for the iron is great. Just found the pad not as thick as it should be for smooth ironing - it ruffles on the small end which shows on the fabric. Contacted Rowenta to see if I could purchase a separate pad but not available. I never took the pad off - only tried to tighten. Ordered the additional cover thinking I could add the pad - unfortunately it's all 1 piece."
1,Don't try to wash it - ever,"I bought the Rowenta professional ironing board, which came with this cover. After about 1 year of use, I washed the cover in cold water and let it air dry. Even with these washing/drying conditions, the cover shrunk appreciably, and would no longer fit on the ironing board."
5,Top quality!,Top Quality and perfect fit for the Rowenta IB6200 Ironing Board. I just wish the price hadn't gone up.
1,poor dimension information,"The dimensions listed in the description of this item are SO incorrect!The cover isn't 69"" long, it's 49"" long! That is a big difference.Amazon, shame on you! Get this error fixed immediately, please!"
3,"If you're into DJ grounded music, this is the CD for you","Usually, when someone says that some piece of art is pioneering or pushing the envelope, it usually means that it's something that's not been done before. Unfortunately, this doesn't always mean it's good. In Logic's case, while he rolls along the lines that have been done before, he makes music that moves and bumps and, for the most part, is flat-out good music. There are instances that didn't propel me, but for the most part this CD is better than Prince Paul's excursions into similar instrumental hip-hop territory, although it isn't quite Mixmaster Mike's Anti-Theft Device. A solid buy for hip-hop heads who don't mind their beats solo."
4,80'S FLASHBACK!,"If you like Bananarama, you'll LOVE Fun Fun! This is a must for any euro disco fan out there! This compilation includes the short versions of their hits from the 2 albums they recorded. The only problem is, once you find yourself really getting into a song, it's over! Hearing the great 80's dance music of ""Color My Love"", ""Baila Bolero"", ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" and ""Capital Girl"" brings back memories of late night dancing at the clubs. Every song on this cd is high energy, fast and easy to dance to with the exception of the toned down version of ""Give Me Love"". You won't be sorry you purchased this cd. If you're into ""80's retro"" dance music, I promise, you'll be listening to this for years to come. Fun Fun is ALWAYS an excellent choice in dance music!"
2,"Cheaply Produced, Poor Quality","Not much to recommend in this cheap compilation, taken from concert recordings. Sound quality isn't great. No information on where or when it was recorded and, other than Duke introducing the band on one cut, no information on who is playing. Gets an extra star because it is Duke Ellington and any Duke Ellington CD, even a poorly recorded, cheaply produced one, offers some good music."
3,"Barely adequate, somewhat disappointing","These pens will show up under UV light on some surfaces, but only faintly. On other surfaces, tehy either don't show up at all or fade within minutes."
1,Don't believe the product description.,"Product description states that the item ""includes a powerful ultraviolet LED penlight and a UV ink marker."" Product that was delivered stated that ""ink can only be seen with UV light sold separately."" Very poor value.Note: Product description has been amended after the date of the above review. My rating does not change, however, as the product is totally useless without the UV light which the vendor does not sell separately."
4,GREAT FUN FOR THE SCOUTS,IT IS A GREAT LEARNING TOOL FOR THE SCOUTS AND A VERY USEFUL TOOL WHEN HIKING IN THE BACK COUNTRY. ALSO PLACING A COMPAS INSERTED INTO THE TOP OF THE STICK HELPS TO LEARN TO NAVIGATE IN THE HIGH COUNTRY.
2,DP re-union is necessary,"On ""The Chronic,"" Kurupt kills on the cut ""stranded on Death Row."" I waited three years for an album from him, and I got one of the illest G-Funk CDs ever, ""Dogg Food."" Him and Daz knew how to rock a party back then. Over the years, Kurupt, all though still good, has begun to lose his flow. If you want a 5-star K the King-pin CD pick up ""Dogg food"" by Tha Doog Pound. Peace!"
1,"""callin' out names"" does not come on this cd","I had this cd when it first came out and lost it, I re-ordered this cd specifically for the hidden track ""Callin' out names"" that disses DMX, Ja Rule, Foxy Brown etc. and it is not on there, this is just a warning to anyone who might buy it for the same reason I did."
5,WEEESTSYYYYDE,"This album is one of the best out LBC diz year kurupts second album iz much betta! I got two complaints about ddiz album : 1. He does only rap alone on 2 tracks and dat makes him seem too unindependent. 2. I do not understand why he iz dissin DMX again.But all the songs are tight! Daz, Meech, Dr. Dre,organized noise and a few others did a great job producin original westcoast beats on diz one. I highly recommend diz! Its even betta den 2001 on both cds you can hear the song wit dre and hittman called ""Housewife"" it has a great beat, actuall betta den the lyrix. so pick diz one up if u need some DPG gangsta ish."
5,TIGHT! This album is easily the TIGHTEST OUT!,This album is hot! The beats Kurupt blesses his fans with are second to none! The best track is the last one where he calls out X! WESTSIDE.....YEEEEEEAAAHHHH!
4,west coast is poppin,"This cd is a must buy. Don't be fooled by any of those west coast/east coast b.s. because it's not about that. Kurupt displays lyrical talents and the nonstop dope beats. So, if people think it's about him dissing other people, it's not. It's about what he sees, feels and knows."
4,WEST IS STILL THE BEST!,THIS ALBUM BRINGS YOU BACK TO DEATH ROW STYLE.THE BEATS TO ME SEEM LIKE THE ONES ON TUPACS ALBUM ALL EYEZ ON ME.THERES AT LEAST 5 OR 6 GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM.THIS ALBUM IS WORTH BUYING I SWEAR TO YOU.
2,Weak,"I was extremely disappointed on buying this album. This is the same Kurupt from Tha Dogg Pound, who made an awesome impression on Snoop Doggy Dogg's ""Doggystyle""? This album is very sloppy, cluttered, and just musically dead. Lyrically, Kurupt often falls into the trap of rhyming three lines with the same word all three times--clever if you do it once, but not over and over. The production on this album is very cheesy, and hokey, as it doesn't even seem to fit the flow of the album. The delivery of Kurupt is quite sloppy, often pays no regard to rhythm, and he often doubles his vocals in the stupidest places, making it even harder to follow. And just as the song moves forward, it ends.Surely a man like Kurupt can do better than this. Only a few tracks like ""Never Gonna Give It Up"" stand out on this album. What a disappointment."
1,extremely dissapointing album,This is the biggest pile of horsesh*t I have ever let upon my virgin ears I want to die
1,Weak AS HELL!,"The worst effort yet from the Death Row orphan. Stick to producing. Weak beats and frail lyrical skills put this album to shame. West Coast can do better. DMX diss has to go. And as for Aftermath and Dre, Eminem and East Coast rapper is the only reason he really sold something. Kurupt raps West Coast but is from Philly. Donations PLEASE FOR THIS POOR ALBUM!"
1,Great Series! Bundle NOT a bargain.,"Seasons 1, 2, and 3 sell on Amazon for 16.99 and Seasons 4 and 5 go for 30.49. Do the math. Hint: It's a lot less than 136.49. Oh Hell. It's 111.95.Great series though."
1,Truly a gross-out book of the first order,"I am not a squeamish reader. Having said that, I put this book down two-thirds of the way through, sickened by the author's apparent fascination with torture and its various medieval devices. The descriptions of torture machines and how they work on the human body are quite graphic, almost as if the author was truly enjoying herself while writing the descriptions. Yuck.The plot works quite well, but unless you're willing to read this gross stuff that will surely stay with you afterwards, move on to something better."
4,"Good, but not for the squeamish","This is a typical Val McDermid book, which means it is well written with a good plot and very well developed characters, but also has some graphic murder details that prevent me from recommending it to the squeamish. If you can handle the gore, it is great. If not, this is not the author for you. The gory parts are few and can be skimmed over fairly easily. If you like books like ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", you will love this. Like ""Tattoo"", the characters are flawed but you really like them and the plot has enough twists to keep you on your toes. This is the second of the Tony Hill series I have read, after ""The Torment of Other"". I only wish I had read them in order. It is not critical, but helpful to read this one first as the two main characters, Tony and Carol, meet in this book. Recommended."
2,tired and dated,The Good: The Mermaids Singing starts off well and feels like a good read. The killers narrative works out fine and hooks you early. Unfortunately as the book progresses it shows its age and in the end fails horribly. The book is about a psychological profiler and perhaps that alone made it interesting in 1995. Unfortunately nearly ten years later I needed more.The Bad: I will put forth no spoilers here but I will say there is little build up to the ending and it is over in a blink of an eye. I felt like Val needed to have the book done by 400 pages and she wrapped it up just before she over shot the mark.I love how she references Silence of the Lambs more than once and then liberally borrows plot points from it.Bottom Line: Read Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs both are way more fun.
1,"Clumsy plot, near-offensive gay caricatures","Setting aside a gaping hole or two in the plot, the scenes of gay nightlife and the way the mystery progresses triggered all my ""latent homophobia"" radar. I understand McDermid has written excellent books featuring a lesbian detective, but based on this book, I figured her to be an over-simplifying dolt, not quite a ""gay basher"" but having more of a ""Look at these ever so *intersting* people in the zoo!"" kind of vibe, which in some ways is worse. I also read ""Place of Execution"" which i liked much better, but in both cases you wish the author were sitting beside you so you could ask a few basic questions and point out glaring inconsistances or ask about ridiculous assumptions on which the plot rests."
4,Takes some patience,"Van McDermid, a first-rate writer of psychological thrillers, can be tantalizing in her detail and measured pace. I'm just used to fast paced, gory stories.This book introduces the Tony Hill and Carole Jordan characters and the uncertainty of their relationship is believable. The characters gradually develop depth and start a reltionship that will last for a number of books and TV movies.I can't tell you how it ends, but you will be surprised.The pace of the book presented the only negative part of the experience. The TV movies don't waste any time, but McDermid, much like P.D. James, takes a lot of time building characters and settings.Overall I enjoyed this book. I did find it tiring."
2,"Too much gore, not enough substance","Enjoyed Tony Hill, both his skills and his mental problems. The story was marred by an obscene amount of graphically described gore--wholly unecessary. The author's preoccupation with sadism, torture and sexual stimulation caused by the violence and torture seemed shallow, almost aimed at justifying sado-masochistic relationships. The serial killer plot was standard and cliched. Characterization of Brandon, Carol (female cop)were pretty good--especially Brandon. The sociopathic killer was sick and disgusting--but no subtlety of characterization--just globs of violence, torture and gore. The fact that the killer is sexually stmulated by torture etc. seemed not justified, but only served to viscerally punch the reader in the groin."
2,A problem of holding back?,"As a work of genre fiction, I found The Mermaids Singing an enjoyable read.As with A Place of Execution (the other book by Ms McDermid that I've read), she holds back a major surprise toward the end. (Don't worry no spoiler here.) One can almost imagine her while writing thinking, ""ooh this is a good one."" By holding this back, however, she strains some of the credibility that she's built up throughout the story. While this type of thing is common in this genre, it leaves the reader with the feeling of having been deceived.That being said if you like crime/suspense/mystery novels, I think you'll enjoy reading The Mermaids Singing."
3,"Not as good as some, but better than others","This book is slow to start ""police detecting wise"" if one can say that. A lot of space is used in describing what is going on from everyone's point of view but not much is being elucidated, as in information collected, or progress is made on the case by cops. Finally the end is somewhat surreal and unconvincing. This is still a worthwhile book to read compared to what is awailable out there on the market.p.s. To the author, please just make the two of them a couple and stop mudding the waters with endless lack of sexual arousal stories and teenage kind of love troubles."
1,the Mermaids Singint,"I finished this book against my better judgement. I hoped there would be some sort of redemption at the end. No such luck. No one is a better person for anything they suffered at the hands of McDermid. The book was so full of gore, torture and perversion I felt like I needed a shower."
5,Pick of the crop,"I've got heavily into Roy Budd's action/""crime jazz"" scores & if I could choose only one reckon this to be the best of the lot - with the Budd trade-mark pulsating percussion & strings particularly powerful on this. Track 14 is my fav. Budd track ever.The album ""Buddism"" is the best intro to his work whilst of the individual scores I consider this one along with ""Black Windmill"" & the much shorter ""Internecine Project"" to be the pinnacle.(Note ""Internecine"" is on the ""Something to Hide"" CD , mispelt as ""Intercine"".In the second rank I place ""Stone Killer"" & ""Fear is the Key"" which don;t quite sustain the brilliance - whilst the others don't really do much that he didn't do better on the above mentioned."
3,Well It's Kevin Smith - What did you Expect?,"This is the follow up to ""An Evening with Kevin Smith"". It's a stand-up Q&A; spread over two discs. On covers the Toronto show, the other covers London. The Canadian audience is larger, and their interaction and lack of reverence towards Smith makes this the better of the two shows. If you don't like Kevin Smith movies, then this is not for you.If you enjoyed ""Jersey Girl"", ""MallRats"" and maybe ""Clerks"", you will find this an amusing way to spend a few hours.The extras include Jay trying out his ""chat-up"" lines on people that the film makers meet on the streets of London (outside Forbidden Planet by the look of it). Although obscene and vulgar, this was in my view about the best DVD extra that I have ever seen."
2,Buy this if you want to laugh,"This is the funniest thing I have ever watched. Clever, articulate, and not just a little vulgar; Kevin Smith makes you feel like he is talking with you and not to you. This DVD set is one that I could watch countless times and never get tired of."
3,Dvd Is Great,"Dvd Is Awesome! Kevin Smith is very Funny!!! Bad Language. I do Recommend this Dvd, For Adults Only. Ok .."
5,Another Evening,Loved the first Evening With and this one delivers as well. Any fan of Kevin Smith will love this Q & A session.
5,A great sequel,"A great sequel to the first Evening, it is amazing how funny Kevin can be from just questions from the audience. The best part is the origin of the ""Trilogy"" rant in Clerks II."
3,Misses the mark,"I LOVED An Evening with Kevin Smith 1 so I was excited to see this release. Unfortunely, Kevin nails it when he says that not much has happened to him since his last tour. He is still funny and witty but the big name stars that the self-proclaimed outsider slammed the first time out are missing (with the exception of Mel Gibson)and there is little to latch onto except his scewed view of life. That view is great but not quite great enough for 3 plus hours."
5,For Baseball Fans,Any fan of baseball on any level will enjoy this well researched volume on the development of baseball as it is played today.
4,Good first three movements but that completed fourth movement ???,"I think Eichhorn is a very good Bruckner conductor. I love his version of the 6th. He is not quite in the league of Furtwangler, Wand (BPO) or Tinder but his Bruckner is worth hearing. I just don't know about this completion of the 4th movement. Its various versions just dont sound like like the composer. There was enough that Mahler left to give us a good idea when it comes to his 10th but I think there was just not enough that Brucker left to have that final movement make sense."
4,Excellent Guy Gift,I purchased this as a Christmas present for my brother-in-law and he loves it. I'm going to purchase a few more to put away for future gifts. It always seems to be so difficult to find the right gift for a guy and I think that this is it.
5,feeding their addiction,"my dog loves these. she'll run through all the tricks she knows, without me asking, just to get a single strip."
5,great product great price,"After the scare about dog food and treats, from China, I was able to find a product that was made here and was priced fairly.My dog is so fussy but she really loves this and it's healthy too"
2,predictable bore,"The Betsy was somewhat slow-moving and boring. Laurence Olivier, such a consumate actor was wasted as the patriarch of the family. There was no action and no real surprises."
1,The Betsy,"The Betsy is indeed the Edsel,Apparently enough it is even worst throw in some immorality in this case incest and nudeyshots and over the top soapopera-esque acting based off some girly novel apparently and knows nothing about cars and you get this A Turbine car,perhaps unaware of the Howmet Tx(Turbine Racer) and other Turbine powered cars.And the references to Nader,Why give such an ambulance chaser Attention?The movie is boring and if it is speaking on Rich and Elitism and Class then it has missed it's mark."
1,What a let down!,"I bought this DVD in August along with several others. I am always buying DVD, and as a result sometimes months would pass before I watch them. Unfortunately this is one of them that I did not open until yesterday. I openend the box to set up the DVD, and the disc was in splinters, I mean about 12-15 pieces.I do not know what to think. I do not guarantee that I will have the time time to check each DVD when they come in. I buy DVDs elsewhere, but this is the first time this has happened. I am just glad it did not cost more."
1,Not the item described or depicted,"The DVD I received was in a keep case, not a snap case, and with a different cover than the one depicted, which I specifically wanted. Also, though this is not the fault of the seller, the transfer is poor, and image quality is no better or worse than the VHS I own of the same movie."
1,The Betsy,This product was never received. It was ordered for another member of the household and just recently came to my attention.Please investigate and provide fulfillment. Thank you.
1,"I Paid For It, Never Recieved It!",I ordered the movie in DVD. But...I never reiceved it!!!Enough said!!! They probably sent it to my Landlady.I never got it!Can I finally get one sent to the right address? Is it going to ake 3 months to do this?
2,Not what the title implies,"This book is designed for mega body builders who want advice on taking lots of supplements in order to bulk up and obtain the type of physique shown on the cover. It is not very good at explaining how to get maximum nutritional value from food in order to more efficiently burn fat, which is what I was hoping for."
1,Extended Ad for Author's Company,"The author owns the supplement company MHP and constantly advertises the products throughout the book, and very extensively at the end. This is the kind of book that many supplement companies give away for free in order to promote. It's not worth paying cash for what is in this book."
4,Interesting book about a shady character,"Dr. Bennett was indeed a person of questionable morals and ideas, perfect for Mormonism in its Nauvoo, Ill. period. Not well-known in the present Mormon church, he presented quite a thorn in its side after leaving it. First book I've come across that gives a detailed account of his life. His book ""History of the Saints"" has been torn apart as a book full of lies, but history has proven at least some of it's contents as being factual. Clint Lauricella"
4,A Better Bennett Book,"The bane of students of restoration history is that while there is an abundance of primary source material in specialized libraries, there is little straight forward history or biography available. This very readable straight forward bio on Dr. Bennett is an excellent starting place for students of the time and place and events of early Mormonism. I recommend it to those who are interested in taking the measure of Bennett. It remained refreshingly focused on Dr. Bennett and leaves to others the challenge of writing about the other players in these colorful and dramatic events."
1,Uninformative and lacks depth,"I have been working on a Tongan grammar guide and task sheet for organizational purposes. I needed a good dictionary to translate some English words. This dictionary has been worthless. As a Tongan, it did not meet any of my expectations. For instance, it did not have translations for the following words: allergy, curious, alcohol, etc. Granted that all the words in the world cannot be translated, but the ones that I needed desperately were not found in the book. I severely regret buying this book for $27.00. I'm planning on posting this on ebay immediately. I was using another dictionary that is out of print. It is the volume of work by Churchward. For me, it has been the best work on the Tongan language. When using it, I never had a problem finding a word. I regret recommending this dictionary to my students and hope no one else burdens themselves with this poorly researched book."
3,Not as helpful as hoped,"Although it is a good book for basics, it is not as intensive as hoped. I would recomend for someone starting out, but not someone that wants it for more then just coversational words, ie ""Hi, how are you"""
5,The title of this book says it all!,"This really is a life changing book. Geshe Kelsang manages to explain even the most profound teachings in ways that the western reader can immediately identify with and understand. I have read many Buddhist works and all of them have been helpful in my understanding of these teachings in one way or another. But this book, gently and with pristine clarity, shows the ""armchair Buddhist"" how to actually connect with Buddha's teachings in a realistic and deeply personal way. Don't pass up this book, it delivers big time."
3,Excellent Book,"Rating due to edition was not the one expected, received older edition than one shown.Neutrally satisfied with the purchase."
5,The definitive guide to the Brandywine Valley,"This book is a great guide to the popular Brandywine Valley area that straddles the Pennsylvania-Delaware border. Visitors to the region and local residents will both find it to be an interesting and valuable resource.One useful feature of the book that is not mentioned in the editorial reviews is its companion website, www.BrandywineGuide.com, which provides updates to the information in the printed guidebook."
5,Excellent debut from a great band you've never heard of,"Fury in the Slaughterhouse are probably the best band coming out of Europe right now if you're into brooding, melodic rock. Everything the Scorpions wish they could've been, Fury in the Slaughterhouse IS. They are full of great songs, great licks and great melodies. Quite frankly, the other critic has no idea what he's talking about -- if you want to hear great rock'n'roll, this is it. Not Fury's finest work, but definitely a promising start for a band that would later become, in my opinion, one of the greatest bands in the world."
2,Smokhouse Poppers Removed from PetSmart,"Please be aware that PetSmart removed these from their shelves a couple weeks ago due to reports of dogs getting sick. While I cannot say these treats are at fault, I do know that my dog ate more of them than usual last night and was a bit throw-uppy this morning...he is totally fine now and he loves them, but I plan to wait for more info before giving him any more..."
1,Made in China,Did not realize this was not a USA product until it arrived. Not interested in risking my pet with questionable treats.
5,Picky Pug Picks Poppers,These are a great product. My extremely picky pug surprised me when she actually ate one of these and wanted more. I have spent so much money on different products and Smokehouse are the one for my entire house. I would recomment this product for your pets. They are about the size of a piece of popcorn.
3,"Good, but not as good as the chicken chips or strips","Neither one of my dogs were very enthusiastic about these. My bigger shar pei ate them, but she will eat anything. My friends pit didn't like them and neither did my smaller shar pei"
5,Our Girls' Favorite Treat by Far,"Our Portuguese Water Dogs, Onda and Lilly, love these treats. They get lots of goodies, but they love the chicken poppers best. Nothing else gets their tails wagging quite the same way."
3,Not complete,The Brazilian jiu-jitsu is most expensive bjj book on the market. What do you get for that price? More then 500 pages with black and white photos of just positions on the ground. This two things (price and just the ground positions) created two stars less then five.
1,"My ""copy"" was blank.","I ordered this DVD so the spouse and I could learn how to best use our kubotans. The DVD I received had a label that matched the photo on the DVD box, but would not play in any of my three DVD players. My computer reported it was a blank CD-ROM. On the plus side, Amazon made it easy to return the product and the refund was prompt. I'd rather have a DVD that worked."
1,Waste of time and money!,"Waste of time. Waited in great anticipation, totally feel taken. Not worth the investment, taught nothing new. Better off checking out stick fighting and finding yawara stick techniques."
3,Very educational,"When I first found this DVD, I thought a demonstration from the inventor himself was great. The techniques shown I felt were very useful. The instructor is a well known and well respected part of the martial arts community and it was great to see him in action. The production value I found was less than stellar. I found it was more instructive to turn the sound off during the demos, the poor sound quality was distracting me from the lessons shown. Despite the low production value, I found this video is a must have for anyone who has the Kubotan."
1,Not impressed.,"I found the dvd to not be particualry helpful. It was hard to understand the instructor at times (strong Japanese accent). He did not teach basic strikes to the body, only showed what to do when someone attacks you and many of the moves were from an opponent who uses karate on you. I did not find it to be useful for quick combative moves in situations of quick attacks or chaos. Was very redundant as well. Moves were not explained as they were preformed, instructor just did them (repeated the move 2-3 x then moves were shown in slow motion). For someone proficient with a kubaton it probably would be helpful but for novices such as myself I did not like the production or teaching."
3,Old-Fashioned Gifts,"The book was a used library book and was not in the best of shape. While it is a very nice book, there were activities that I would not have included. I really enjoy Tasha Tudor's work and very much liked seeing her home and gardens. She was a remarkable woman."
3,Galileo,"So maybe it's not completely accurate. I just read this book for a class I have to take. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It wasn't the dry, boring piece of literature I had expected. It's really a book to read - maybe not multiple times, but at least once. It has an important message, and is presented in a reasonably interesting way."
1,This is tripe,"Anybody who would recommend this as a history book is completely unaware of the true history. Brecht may have been using dramatic license or he may have had an axe to grind with the Catholic Church. Either way, this is NOT an accurate historical account. Any person who would suggest it as such is guilty of what Brecht and revisionists accuse the Church of doing: suppressing the truth to further their personal agenda."
3,Interesting Drama,"This was an interesting historical play that educated as well as dramatized. Though, for this reader, it fizzled toward the end."
3,The frailty of man,"This book shows the scientific insights of Galileo and his stand againt the religious authorities, along with his collapse in the face of personal threat."
3,Something is missing,The book's story is excellent and it'll keep you reading all the time. Each and every one's scams were scrumptiously plotted but the problem is that the end misses the punch line so when you'll finish the book you'll be a little disappointed -with the last swindle.
5,What a charming story,"I found myself laughing out loud, especially at the end which really threw me for a loop. Archer is one of the better story teller's of our time. He knows just how to weave a tale and make the end of every chapter a cliff-hanger. I have enjoyed reading several of his novels which are full of suspense, outstanding plots and excellent dialogue. But Not a Penny More is in a class by itself. If Hollywood didn't mess things up so badly, I would suggest a contemporary version of this story set to film. In the meantime, happy reading!"
4,Papa John Stole the Show,"I saw Jefferson Airplane in Cleveland, Ohio in the early 70's. I wondered who that old man with the fiddle was, and what in the world he was doing on stage. Grace Slick came across as obnoxious and insulting, possibly drunk and/or high like many of the musiclovers present, but Papa John was sublime. He was as good as Grace was bad. I bought but have long since lost the album for sale here, and it is terrific, although it may not be Airplane fans' cup of tea. Some time ago I saw Grace on television telling an interviewer that she was not interested in any kind of Airplane reunion tour because ""there's nothing as pitiful as a bunch of old people on stage trying to do rock and roll."" Have to agree after some of the geezer tours that have come along, but she surely wasn't thinking of the old coot who took the pitiful out of her show and made it rock like it was 1972."
3,Travel to foreign lands with Kelly...,"In this set: Kelly goes to Scotland, Holland and Spain. The costumes are well-done for the scale, but not removable. These items really are designed as ornaments for the adult collector, but nice educational information enclosed on the countries Kelly represents."
5,Serge goes to Jamaica!,"Great reggae album recorded in the late 70's with jamaican musicians. Gainsbourg made a scandal when he recorded his reggae version of the French official hymn AUX ARMES ET CAETERA. It was and still is banned from most of the radio stations. Not long after that, he made another scandal on French television when he put fire to a 500 francs bill (100$) to explain what he had left in his pocket after he had paid all his taxes to the French Government.This is truly one of his best albums and one he's remembered for in France. Of course, he plays a lot with the words and everything may not appear as good as it is if you don't speak French but on this album just the music is already enough."
3,Great album overal,"This album is a real pleasure to listen to. Müchener Freiheit is a great band and it' very sad they never achieve success outside of Germany. For your information , this album was also released in English , but it's very sadly out of print now. Too bad."
4,Freiheit is great!,"I fell in love with the english version of this band back in 1991. I wish I could find a CD in english still, although the german version will suffice."
4,Good budget disc,"Decent performance at a very low price. Bass quantity and performance isn't quite like my Verany and Telarc discs, but still enjoyable. I'm impressed with the diversity, a couple of chorales, fugues, and a Bach/Vivaldi concerto. However, I'd skip this one if price isn't a consideration and get a higher quality disc with similar selections."
2,Cutesy and obvious,"I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others, it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now."
1,Don't believe the hype,"The real victims of this book are not the (mostly) innocent dupes of Guy Grand's schemes, but the poor readers who wade doggedly through this miasma of humorless pranks in hopes of catching a glimpse of the ""hilarious and wickedly original novel"" promised on the back cover. I fail to see how this horribly dated book would have been considered funny even when it was published forty years ago. I was so surprised the first time the book caused me crack a smile that I marked the page (page 33 - POETRY?). It would be another hundred pages until I actually laughed. Unfortunately it was almost the end of the book and I had been numbed by the comedic void which preceded it. This book is like expired milk. I keep asking my friends to try it to make sure it isn't just me. So far, everyone agrees it's pretty rotten."
2,"Meh, not bad not great","The pranks Guy does are pretty funny. As a satire it works pretty well but as an engaging read it fails. The interludes between the pranks where Guy is conversing with the two older women didn't have a point or any interesting content, just filler between Guy's schemes (which were usually really funny). I found myself trying to speed read through those as I got further through the book once I realized they weren't related to anything (like the commercials during a reality show). As a story it doesn't go anywhere, the order of the pranks could be interchangeable, but its a short book and you can get a few chuckles out of it."
2,prescient?,"I'll admit I got a couple of chuckles out of this book, but really it's a one-joke premise, and Southern goes nowhere with it. He has nothing even resembling an ending.The basic setup is that there's this eccentric billionaire, Guy Grand, who delights in setting up practical jokes that showcase the greed or vulgarity of the teeming masses.Southern's book has received a lot of attention lately; several commentators have cited it as unwittingly having anticipated the cruel reality shows that seem to dominate today's TV lineups.Maybe, but one difference: Grand's victims didn't know they were victims. That's what's so funny. The men and women who sign release forms and agreee to appear on reality shows or mean-spirited game shows these days know in advance they will be humilated, and frequently for nothing more than a few days of fame.So I'm not sure how prescient it is. I wouldn't read it again."
2,"Tiring, gets old","Guy Grand's pranks are hilarious, sure. Actually, Southern deserves a lot of credit here. It's amazing how well his humor has held up. It's still fresh, still very funny. However, as a full on novel, it doesn't work. The prank sequences, which are all quite funny, are punctuated with pieces of this horribly boring scene that extends throughout the entire novel and fails to really say much about anything. I found myself skipping those parts towards the end and enjoying the humorous segments for what they were: disconnected comical ideas, perhaps most appropriate as synopses for episodes of an imaginary sitcom."
5,PLAYING WITH PEOPLE,"In ""Dr. Mabuse, Der Speiler"", Mabuse said that nothing was interesting anymore, except for ""playing with people & with the destinies of people"". Mabuse may well have been describing the life of Guy Grand, protagonist of The Magic Christian. Though Grand is no doubt a less mean spirited figure than Mabuse, his humor is no less misanthropic in nature. If you enjoyed the Peter Sellers/Ringo Starr movie, expect to be stunned. The book is above & beyond anything you saw on the screen. If you're like me you'll find yourself rereading it on a yearly basis--- it's THAT funny! Really."
2,just couldnt get into it,"IHThis may not be fair, but I deleted this book after only reading 1/4 into it. I give it two stars to be fair on that point. I didn't care for the so what, I've got a lot of money and I can say and do whatever I want and degrade people in the process attitude."
5,amazing sound and gripping lyrics,This entire album is amazing! Every song has a little different style and emotional feel to it. It is very versitile and definetly a cd you can pop in and want to listen to the whole way through! Seeing Lindy in concert heightened my experience even more! I ventured from Seattle up to canada to see it and am so happpy I did! He's an amazing show to see....what a talent!!! This cd is a must for all good music collections!
3,Carb adapter has to be adapted...,"I bought this adapter to mount an Arlen Ness Big Sucker to a Mikuni 42 carburator. It comes with all the necessary hardware but the instructions were a little vague. When I tried to mount the two units together, they would not fit and I had to literally grind down two areas on the adapter where it hit the Ness Big Sucker. I opted for this adapter because it was built better, IMHO, and that it had a bolt to tighten it down on the carb flange. If you have a grinder and a little mechanical ability then this is a no brainer. If you have a hard time checking your oil, opt for the other adapter. Overall, I would definitely recommend this adapter because you know how much a harley shakes if you own one and I want to keep my parts on the bike until I take them off."
4,"soft sole, warm!","I really like them because they are true to size, keep my feet warm and they are super comfy. I just felt a little off balance the first couple times wearing them because foot cushion a bit high."
5,Daniel Green Women's Tracy Slipper,"These are the first 'slipper' I've purchased where the elastic actually holds the shoe on; most others end up sliding off my heel, becoming 'flippers'. Sturdy sole, but not too stiff to be uncomfortable. Would purchase again."
3,terry slipper,"The slipper is soft and conforms well to the foot. It is slightly short-not a full size. I would buy another pr, only in one size larger."
4,Comfy,Slippers are very comfortible. Good thing I ordered HALF SIZE LARGERthan what I wear...they do run small.
5,Like walking on a cloud!,I just love these slippers! The moment I put them on the fit perfectly and felt like I was walking on a cloud. The pattern is lovely and have a sole that is perfect for in the house and for that occasional venture outside.
3,slippers run small,"These slippers are soft and furry, and they seem well-made. They are my usual size but run small - short to be exact. I kept them because it's hard to find slippers that aren't junky or too hot."
5,love these slippers!,I haven't taken them off since my boyfriend bought them for me. they are very comfortable. i love the memory foam.
3,EASY LISTENING SHOPPING SONGS,"I was in the grocery store this morning and they were playing SWEET PEA. I suppose they had a backlog of vegetables. But it made me think of Tommy Roe. So I listened to the samples, and it's not that bad! I think JAM UP AND JELLY TIGHT was a hit song many decades ago. It sounds filthy - but I wonder if it really is?"
4,SUBLIME 60s POP,"This is the soundtrack to my pre-teen days and I'm surprised at how well it's stood the test of time. It may have been called bubblegum, but I consider it great pop music because of the catchy melodies and the slick production. In fact it was and remains very hypnotic music, especially songs like Sweet Pea, Dizzy and Hooray For Hazel. A track like Heather Honey even has a tinge of sadness. Other great melodic numbers include Jam Up Jelly Tight, Sheila and there's even a decent cover of Stagger Lee. This type of pop music sounds quite original and unique when compared to lots of the colorless fluff that rule the charts these days. It had something, a certain flavour or personality, that sets it apart and makes it an enjoyable listening experience even after more than three decades."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun","This is a great compilation of Tommy Roe's hits and near misses. While much of his music carries the bubble gum tag, the tunes are light and his voice is good. I especially liked the final cut, Stagger Lee, which surprised me because he did a great cover. As for the bubble gum songs, Sweet Pea, Hooray for Hazel, and Dizzy are cute songs for the era. Jam Up and Jelly Tight is bouncy and Pearl is a hidden gem. For the older baby boomers, the CD brings back lots of pleasant memories."
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND S&H CHARGE,"Absolutely misleading description! You turn the game on and CANNOT SEE ANYTHING! I thought i got a broken unit, went to Target got another one, returned the one I had and the new one was the same! Different buttons don't function properly on different units, on the first one the DEAL button would not respond. The second one pretty much as soon as I turned on and saw no light on the so-called LCD screen I new the hand-held game is a waste. And what a hassel to return to Amazon! Besides DON'T BUY THIS GAME, DON'T ORDER ON AMAZON. I got another game Tetris and that one just came broken, still trying to return it. IT'S A ""NO DEAL"" ON THE DEAL!"
3,fun..but..............,"I recently purchased this game, and had a ball with it, however, when it came time to turn it off, it would not turn off. It has a built in battery saver to shut off after 5 minutes, but you should be able to turn it off right away. I returned it for a new one, and that one wouldn't even turn on. Once again I went to the store and exchanged it, and got another one that won't turn off when you want it to. It's a fun game, but it has issues."
5,WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL,"When Deal Or No Deal debuted Christmas week last year I was keen on watching it because of my dislike of bald guys but when I saw Howie Mandel on it I fell instantly in love with him. And so when my dad bought me this game I could've never been happier and so far it's been my favorite personal item to take in my Baby Phat purse,WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS GAME,Very addicting { I once held up a mall trip by playing it},Has the actual music though it's not the rock version of the theme,Has a resume option to continue in case you go to the grocery store and you want to put it on hold,WHAT I HATE ABOUT THIS GAME,No batteries in some games,Howie Mandel's voice is not featured in it,Overall a wonderful game for the DOND fan,Enjoy"
5,Big Time with a Big Bonus,"In addition to two versions of ""Big Time"" and the studio version of ""No Self Control,"" there are two songs previously unreleased that have a distinct West African feel to them. ""Curtains"" full of intense quietness. ""Across The River,"" which is performed on the ""Secret World Live"" album, feels like a Serengeti safari put to music. If for no other reason, these bonuses are worth the cost of this CD."
1,Don't bother,"Powerful..absolutely but extremely difficult to operate and they do not maintain stability even with a beefy Gitzo tripod w/video head. I needed to modify the center support rail in order to prevent the lens barrels from seesawing back and forth. Principally a novelty item which I'm now stuck with!On the plus side, these binoc's do pull in a distant scene. I can view skiers on a mountain 10 miles from my back deck."
1,You get what you pay for - made in China,"I have been an amateur astronomer for over 40 years. I've owned the gamut from dobs to SCTs to refractors. I currently own a Stellarvue 115 apochromat. I was in the market for a large pair of astro binocs for casual observing and decided to try these Zhumells, even though the price was probably too good to be true (compared to e.g., Fujis or Taks).Needless to say, these binos are very disappointing. Lots of chromatic aberration, very small useable field (The in-focus field starts to degrade about 50% out from center), dim images for objectives of this size (100mm).I wound up sending these back the next day. I purchased a pair ofVixen 1456 16x80 Giant ARK Binocularfor $600 that I am VERY pleased with (after testing them side-by-side with Fujinon 16x70s), see my review under the Vixen model."
2,Lots to consider before buying........,"These are not grab and go binocs and are awkwardly heavy. A quality heavy duty tripod is a must ($170-$200 extra). They do bring far distances up nice and close. But I compared these to a pair of $60 Celestron 15X70's in viewing a variety of distances and the clarity and brightness were about equal. When panning the sky, the narrow telescopic like field of vision really comes into play and takes some getting use to."
2,Not the best choice,This is simply a transfer of the LP master done when CDs were just getting started. The quality is inferior to other collections and the selection is weaker. Go for the Collectables twofer instead. Much better sound and more cuts.
5,Greatest hits,I bought 2 of this guys cds I like the greatest hits the best. I have listened to it many times already. Its great easy listening tunes. I would recommend it for any age group. It would also be good slow dancing music.
5,My Personal Favorite,"If there were one season of any tv show that I love the most, it would be this one. Season one of chuck is witty, excited, new, and just plain fun. The first time I watched this DVD, I literally sat in front of a TV with my friend and forced him to watch the entire season in one sitting with me. After watching this, you'll be ready for season 2, no doubt. If you're looking for a smart, fun, and excited tv show to watch with a great cast, look no further."
4,chucky chuck chuck,"frist i want to say that this show has always been one of my favorites. but when i bought this frist season in most episode it stopped for minutes and gave me a static screen and kept on doing it. im not sure if it was just my bluray or a bad copie. most people would return it instantly but its cool i just decided to stick with this one season and forget about the rest being that NBC wanted to cancle this but instead made them bring it to a forced end. if you didnt like chuck then you were a lame.*update* lol, turns out it was my hdmi cord. it had a shortage. and i changed my mind, i just decided to watch chuck agin the other day and forgot how much it made me laugh. so i will be purchasing the rest of the seasons, just on cyber monday. seems a little to pricey for my spending buget."
4,The funniest show you should be watching!,I love this show. Its so funny/quorky/full of adventure. Won't regret buying/renting it. Zachary Levi is so great at being an accidental spy with a crappy job. The guy that plays Morgan is so needy/funny.
5,Fall 2007's best new show,"An excellent pastiche of spy shows such as Alias and 24, with a good looking nerd and a beautiful heroine. What more caould we ask for? A great send up of best Buy and the Geek Squad. Light and fluffy, but that's all it pretends to be."
3,"Great show, bad Blu-ray","This show is hilarious, and I'm so glad my husband convinced me to buy it. However, I'm not impressed with the Blu-ray quality. The majority of the scenes are very grainy on my 42"" plasma. I will be buying season 3 on regular DVD. I give the show 5 stars, and the Blu-ray 3 stars."
4,great show - not the best xfer to blu-ray though,"I think Chuck is one of the best TV shows ever and I love having season 1 on blu-ray, but the quality of the picture is quite grainy at times... So don't expect it to be an amazing looking blu-ray experience... the show looks better on my DVR'd episodes at 1080i playing from my motorola cable box (comcast) with component cables then it does playing from the blu-ray disks on my Sony BDP350 via HDMI.. so just letting that be known."
3,"Great Show, ok picture quality","I got the Blu-ray so I could enjoy this great show in all it's HD glory.Boy am I disappointed. Should have just bought the dvd and had it upscaled.The picture quality is lacking, very grainy.Great show, mediocre blu-ray set."
4,Fun,"I've only seen the pilot episode, but it was definitely worth whatever Amazon's Unbox charged me. The women are stunning, and the show is clever. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!"
4,"Great Show, Hot women + Geeks and Spys","I avoided this show, I thought it was supposed to be corny, actually I thought it was a 30 minute sitcom, which I avoid generally because I don't watch tv on TV and I'm not willing to pay for 23 minutes of a show. I downloaded a show to check it out, liked it, and immediately decided to buy the season from amazon and stream it to my xbox. Great quality, superhot women, interesting character interaction, and I think The Intersect is a new scifi device I'm going to keep in my head for a while. ;)"
3,Psych Gone Techno CIA Nerd Herders,"I really like the pilot and the character introductions. The episode was entertaining, funny and had action. It was enough for me to tune in again. Well second episode did not live up to the first, which is not a good sign. Very disappointed. I will tape the third to see if it improves from the pilot and I will continue to watch. So its Prison Break for me now and dvr Chuck for week three."
4,Chuck: The Complete First Season [Blu-Ray],"Nice show, fresh, funny, with bits of drama. Bit poor Blu-Ray quality and with nice price."
4,40 something,Arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It is a series the whole family can enjoy but not a series that when an episode is over I am anxious to watch the next one.
5,Best Series EVER!!,I saw an episode of Chuck and just had to buy the first season. It is such a funny television series!
2,Chuck On Blu-Ray,"I rate the show itself 5, but the Blu-ray release I give a 2. Blu-ray is just a way of formattimg the disk. Just because something is released on Blu-ray doesn't mean it's HD. This is a case in point. I assumed that because there was both a DVD and Blu-Ray release that the latter would be HD, but it isn't. It has a widescreen picture but it's a poor quality grainy picture. You might as well get the DVD version. I think the Video on Demand version looks better than this. Also, you can't select a particular episode because all of the episodes on the disk follow one right after another. I guess they assumed people would want to sit and watch 6 episodes straight through. Overall I'm very disappointed."
5,love this show,"So much fun to watch. An amazingly blend of humor, action, espionage and romance. They hit the ground running and never falter."
4,"Good show, silly premise","We enjoy the show but the basic premise of the show, shown in the pilot, is silly. I won't explain it to avoid being a spoiler. It was pretty cool for the network to allow a free download of the pilot before it aired. It also pretty clearly revealed there are only 42 minutes in a one hour show."
5,funny and offbeat,"Watching the pilot, I first thought the story back drop was a little unbelievable. But there are quite a few funny lines in there, and the chemistry between the main characters really started to draw me in. I think I'm going to like this show."
5,Love this show!,I can't wait for the new episodes. It's extremely funny and action packed at the same time. I highly recommend this show :)
5,"Zainy, original ... oddball comedy ... the strength of which is relationships","I stumbled over Chuck one evening ... when, by all intensive purposes, I had been avoiding it. From the previews, it didn't look interesting to me. However ... the episode Chuck verses the sandstorm I laughed so hard ... because it was just crazy. For Chuck. His reactions are perfect.Still, he has the sister who loves him, the perfect Captain Awesome who dates his sister, a best friend ... a CIA girl who plays his girlfriend. Everyone on the show has their quirks. Everyone seems to fit someone you know.And it somehow works.The only problem???? It is hard to describe the show's premise without it sounding really odd. Because it is. And its' even harder to explain what an episode is about, because it takes you for a crazy ride.I love it. The best ride in ... well a long time."
4,decent quality,Great show but the first few episodes there is a lot of static in the whites. Pretty decent quality but not as high as some other blu-ray seasons i own.
5,fun and frivolous but with heart!,"Chuck is an 'awesome' series with great writing, a great cast and a premise that promises to keep decent storylines ticking over for many episodes to come. Chuck himself is a sweet, dork with a heart of gold who finds himself living out his video game fantasies in real life as he becomes embroiled in a life of accidental espionage.The supporting cast are well written and all the characters get a chance to shine and grow. Despite it's comedy status you'll find yourself really starting to care about the characters and their plight.This is a well rounded, thoroughly enjoyable series for anyone who likes their spy shows with a tongue-in-cheek feel but doesn't want to skimp on the action!"
5,Great show!,"I bought this DVD set for my husband who LOVES! LOVES! LOVES! the show, Chuck. (of course I love the show too) I have only ordered from Amazon a few times but the few times I have ordered from them their service has been excellent."
5,Awesome show! So-so video transfer,"This is an amazing television show. From the stories, to the writing, to the characters, to the acting, this show is great. You can really connect to the characters, and within a few episodes you're really into Chuck. I've told a few friends about it, and they're all addicted now. And buying the DVDs is a great way to show support for the show... I bought both the DVDs and Blu-ray so support what they're doing.The DVD transfer is just so-so, and I would have loved to have had commentary from the writers and actors, but we'll take what we can get, right?"
4,Chuck,"There's something about this series that just gets to me. Maybe it's the simple honesty of the main character, Chuck, and how he draws that out of the rough and serious costars, Sarah Walker & John Casey. Maybe it's because I like happy endings. Maybe it's because I like spy thrillers but don't like eyes being popped out with diving knives. Maybe it's because I think Yvonne Strahovski is hot. Maybe I'd better stop there.There's also the total idiocy of the characters at the ""BuyMart"" which always has me laughing."
5,Love it.,"Aside from Top Gear this has to be the best show on any TV network today.Anyways, on to the product itself. The packaging is just like any other Blu-Ray movie. A lot of people have complained about the quality of the video being grainy and it is true. I've heard that season one was filmed in standard definition and if that's true then it explains the flaws in the video quality. Season two was broadcast in HD however, so expect the season two Blu-Ray set to have better video quality.Either way, it's still a great buy if you have a Blu-Ray player. If you don't, go for the DVD set and save some money."
5,Funny and exciting and heartwarming,"For no particular reason I decided to watch the Pilot of Chuck on NBC's web site. Then I proceeded to watch the rest of season one on the WB's web site, in about two days. This show is so good that I hope it stays on for a dozen more seasons."
3,"Fantastic show, maddeningly bad Blu-Ray","I guess I'm just here to reiterate what everyone else has said -- CHUCK is a great show, but the Blu-Ray sucks.For me, it's not the picture quality (which is mediocre at best). It's the lack of menus and episode selection. You put the Blu-Ray disc in the player and it starts playing automatically on the first episode. This is fine if you're going to watch the many episodes on the disc back-to-back. But if you take the disc out of the player (at least with my player) and watch something else, then go back to CHUCK, you start over again from the beginning, and there is no ""episode selection"" menu to allow you to choose which episode you want to see. You have to chapter-advance through every chapter until you reach the episode you want to see.As everyone else has said, get the DVD and skip the Blu-Ray. It's not worth the extra money."
3,Chuck is just ok,"Humor was ok, seemed a bit forced at times. Special FX were lame, but understand they can't spend crazy amounts of money on them for a sitcom. I won't watch it past this pilot and have a feeling it may not last."
1,Overrated show,"I watched this because of all the hype about the show, and because the producer, Josh Schwartz, has a good reputation. I also thought the pilot was promising.This episode, however, was terrible. Lots of overacting and full of absurd sitcom cliches. It's hard to believe that the producer of OC, famous at first for its understatement, made this overacted, unsubtle, unwatchable episode. I do not know why the show is so well-liked, but I do not plan to watch any more episodes."
1,Nooooooooooooooooo,im a geek and it seems this show is suppose to appeal to someone like me. it does but there is so much wrong with it(dont get me started).i was so looking foward to it and i hope they get new writers that at least know some nerds and geeks.i hope the show gets better because i like the idea.
5,james bond meets the office,"This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. Its premise is simple, geeky joe shmo (chuck) gets an e-mail containing encoded government secrets from his old friend turned nemesis (bryce). Bryce destroyed the computer containing the secrets and now, chuck is the CIA and NSA's only source of advanced intel.Two agents(one CIA, one NSA) are sent to protect chuck and use his intel to take down various baddies. The double life spurred by chuck's circumstances leads to some dramatic and very hilarious moments, particularly with his best friend Morgan. Chuck's day job is at the BuyMore (Best Buy) and he's a member of the Nerd Herd (Geek Squad). The interactions with his whacked out co-workers also make for some really funny moments, similar to 'the office'.I really don't want to go into too much more detail, but I can tell you that this show is extremely entertaining and though it is sometimes predictable, it is well worth your time. Hope this helps!"
