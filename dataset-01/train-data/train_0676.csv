5,MUST HAVE!,"This album is GREAT! As for you peeps who gave it a 1 star rating -- why are you listening to it, anyway? If you don't like pop and you don't like 'N Sync, then don't listen to it. As anyone can see from all these 4 and 5 star ratings, most peeps like this album. I love it, even listening to it now in October. It's simply great! Trust me on this one -- you won't be disappointed! :o)"
5,AWESOME -- TOTALLY ENTERTAINING!!!!!!!!!,"Hi! I'm KitKat's mom in Watsonville, CA. I just had to put in my review of this fantastic group. I enjoy (love) to listen to their music and their incredible dancing skills. The guys always look like they're having fun. Recently KitKat had an *NSYNC birthday. *NSYNC t-shirts, calendar, latest BOP magazines, IN THE MIX video, their official book and even her cake. I had a computerized color photo of the guys on her cake. Of course we didn't eat the top half of the cake with all their faces on it only the bottom half. The rest of the cake has been put into our freezer forever!!!!! I just have to say I think the group is so talented and caring about their fans. We hope they'll be around for a long, long time. We're waiting for their next CD -- HURRY! Good luck guys!"
5,This is just plain GREAT!,This is THE best Christmas CD I have ever heard! I suggest you ALL buy it! They have great songs that they wrote themselves AND some original Christmas songs in their own version! It is just GREAT! Happy Holidays everyone!
5,The CD is Wonderful,I just got the cd and I already know all the words. It is addicting!!! I have their other cd and this one is just as Great!!!! It is a wonderful combination of old favorites and new ones sure to become favorites! I recomend it to anyone who wants a good sounding Christmas cd.
4,It's a great Christmas follow-up!,"The songs all go with 'N sync's style, and their vocals are just as sweet and well-mixed as their first album. I just got it today (I ordered it advance), it just was released today, and I have to say it's one of the better follow-up albums I've heard for a so-far one-hit-CD group. My fav song so far is ""I Never Knew The Meaning Of Christmas"". I recommend you get it if you liked the first CD! It's *N Sync sty'lin Christmas vogue! -Jessica; Seattle, WA"
5,'N SYNC lights up your christmas,"'N SYNC's new album ( HOME FOR CHRISTMAS) is something every girl wants for christmas. So buy for your love ones, because you'll know that they'll enjoy it. The album includes R&B, POP, Dance, Country, Jazz."
1,Boring,"They have bad music, don't write their own songs, and that one guy is weird looking ( ya know with the pony tail)"
1,So this is christmas?,If this is this the future of X-mas music I'm converting. This Cd was the worst thing to happen to Christmas since Celine Dione. This Cd is obviously propaganda leading people from the joy of christmas. The original X-mas music was bad this is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times worse. Please don't buy this it might encourage them to release more x-mas CDs and God help us all if they do.
2,It was too sad and gloomy for any X-mass album.,"Well, sure it had a couple of the old classics, but really, who wouldnt get sick of it after the 500th time? I thought that christmas was supposed to be more than just love songs about beautiful women."
1,boring,"Pre-packaged, digitalized Christmas. Lacks the spirit of the holiday.You know the argument that Christmas is too commercialized? That it's just a marketing ploy for Hallmark? This is that argument in CD form. Too commercial and studio-ized."
1,Sorry excuse for a Christmas album,"My mom bought this CD for my sister and I think that it was just a big waste of money. I HATE ""Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays"" or whatever it's called. *N Sync has this stuck up attitude and they think that anything they put out will be gobbled up by consumers. Not everyone is an eight year old girl, and not everyone enjoys what they put out. They need to expand their horizons if they want to last in the music industry. Break out of the bubblegum mold and start singing some real music."
1,Merry Christmas and a Woosy New Year,"Well,well, a Christmas album from the most boring group in the history of music. Sorry but I think it's possible to have a thrash metal Christmas album. What I'm saying is that it doesn't have to put you to sleep in order for it to be heartfelt and beautiful. This is the Christmas gift for teenyboppers and wimps."
1,"This Album is quite easily, the worst CD EVER!","After the popularity of N'Syncs' catchy song, "" Tearin' up my heart"" I decided to give them a try with their next album. Oh my lord this IS the worst cd ever. With those boys singin' songs that are so annoying and dumb, I couldn't stand it! The first song, it was like, totally off key, and sounded exactly like the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and so on. Stay away, N'Syncs' made a stink."
5,Home for Christmas by Nsync,"Well I bought this album in May and I really like it. This album really shows the voices of all the guys. There is no question these guys can really sing. Although the majority of the songs are about ""love with someone"" at Christmas, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The traditional songs are great, but, the original songs are extemely easy on the ears. Like another reviewer- you won't be able to get ""Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays"" out of your head. I love that song. It is fun and happy and brings out the true meaning and spirit of Christmas and the video of it is pretty cool too! Justin does alot of the lead vocals and he does them beautifully as well as JC and Chris. There is even one song portion that you hear only Lance on, which is a nice surprise. If you are an *Nsync fan than you should own this CD too. You will love it!"
3,Nice CD!,"This is a pretty good Christmas CD, *NSYNC have chosen a whole lot of songs that don't bore us to death every October to Boxing Day. The tracks I liked best were Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Kiss Me At Midnight, those two are probably the fastest ones. But the harmonizing on the rest of the CD is flawless, like on The Only Gift, I Guess It's Christmas Time, The First Noel and Oh Holy Night. This CD has the customary Justin and JC, with a bit of Chris singing lead, but also more Joey and Lance which was cool to hear. Nice listening, all year round!"
5,Lovely CD,"Thanks to N Sync for bringing new, beautiful Christmas songs to the world, and for bring back a few classics. I have been listening to this CD constantly since I bought it (just ask my parents). Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatric, and Justin Timberlake all have the most amazing. voices. If anyone knows who sings the first solo part in ""The First Noel"" please email me. Thanks."
5,This CD was the bomb!!,Yo all this is N_syncGurl author of the N Sync Palace web page(it'll be out in a while).I just wanted to say that this cd is the bomb!! It is so wiked that N Sync would put out a Christmas Album. N Sync i luv u guys!!! Keep it goin' 4 ever!!!!
5,"It's a really, really sweet X- mas CD!!!!!",WE really love the clips we've heard from this CD!!! It really doesn't amaze us 'cuz 'nsync is a bunch of really talented guys.:) We really enjoyed all the CD's . After you hear it you'll be HOOKED. Thanx ya'll STAY 'NSYNC:)!!!!!!!
5,I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE CD,I REALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR THE CD TO COME OUT I LOVE NSYNC ESPECIALLY JUSTIN . JUSTIN I LOVE YOU
3,I really don't know...,The only thing about this is that there are not really any traditional songs. It's the only reason I give it three stars. I don't have much else to say. Sorry...
5,I love this alblum,"Everytime when I'm working at Sears, they always put on the songs in this alblum on and it makes me so sad. Just thinking about how sad this Christmas year is and I miss these songs so much. I used to own this cd but its been a very long time and It suckd that Walmart didnt have it. I'll have to buy this after christmas. its really sad but oh well."
4,"Christmas music as it should be, warm and cozy.","'N Sync, what can I say. This album packed the whole spirit of Christmas in a neat little round disc with a pretty little bow that's 'N Sync. The guys sing about being with family and loved ones during this magical time of the year on the 14-track album which includes the typical oh-so-sweet songs such as ""the Only Gift"" and ""I Never Knew the Meaning of Christmas"", happy holiday tunes like ""Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays"" and ""Kiss Me at Midnight"", and also a snappy rendition of the traditional Christmas favorite ""Oh Holy Night"" , done a cappella. The album possesses the general moods of Christmas, the perfect gift to round off any prepubescence female's year. And as always, the guys are stayin' 'n sync:)"
5,Home For Christmas,"If you liked No Strings Attached and *NSYNC, then you'll love this collection of Christmas tunes. Some, like Under My Tree and Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, are original, while others, like O Holy Night (a capella[sp?])and The First Noel, are traditional Christmas songs."
4,ONLY ONE small PROBLEM,"This CD is really cool and it has a whole bunch of good songs that you can read about in other reviews. This was my only problem...almost all of the songs are secular! Barley any of them talk about Jesus' birth, which is why Christmas is here. One of there songs say, "" I never knew the meaning of Christmas, till I looked into your (a girlfriends) eyes"". Thats pretty stupid! Otherwise, the songs are pretty, they are just way too secular."
5,The 'N Sync Christmas Album is wonderful.,"The 'N Sync Christmas Album is a wonderful album. Even though there are only three traditional songs, all the other ones are just as great. Hopefully, these songs will become holiday classics as well. Their harmonies on O Holy Night are amazing. They put a lot of hard work into this album and it shows."
3,N'Sync is nice,"The harmonies are nice, but here is a huge news flash: if you like this cd, go out and buy Tom Petty, Deanta, Bob Marley, the Supremes, and REM. Thank You! Goodbye peoples, Celtic music is so phat! Goodbye!"
2,Annoying.,"There are a few good tracks on this CD- Under My Tree, Merry Christmas (Happy Holidays) and I Never Knew the Meaning of Christmas, but beside those, there isn't much on this CD worth listening to. A few of the songs could be very pretty, but Justin is so whiny on 9/10 of this CD, it makes you cringe.*NSYNC has put out some honest effort in a few of their CDs and have had some very good songs. This doesn't contain any of them, though."
4,THIS FUNKY FOLLOW UP ALBUM IS SURE TO BE A HIT,"THIS CD IS THE PERFECT FOLLOW UP TO 'N SYNC'S PLATNUIM DEBUT ALBUM. ALTHOUGH SOME BANDS SUFFER FROM BACKLASH WHEN THEY REALEASE THEIR SECOND ALBUM, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS ALBUM WILL ONLY HELP THEM. THE SONGS ARE FRESH, AND FUNKY. THEY ARE UPBEAT, AND HAPPY. VERY REFRESHING. THE VOCALS ARE GREAT, AND THE INSTRUMENTAL, ALTHOUGH A LITLE CHEESY, GOES WELL WITH THE MUSIC. OVER ALL THIS IS A GOOD FOLLOW UP ALBUM, AND WILL DEFIDENTLY BE A HIT."
5,awesome CD,HEY!!! this CD is awesome. my fav. song's Under My Tree...this is the BEST song ever!!! NSYNC rulez!
1,ANOTHER PORE ALBUM!,"It sucked just like the first album. I expected more from ""N'sync"" but did not get it. All the songs on this cd sounded the exactly the same and the songs were awful!"
2,Too lovey-dovey,"The CD had nice christmas songs, but I was dissapointed by most of the songs. If it was supposed to be a christmas CD, then why would it have all those songs about kissing and all that other crap?! Some of the CD was nice, but some of it wasn't fit for the whole concept of the CD."
1,Just Plain Bad,This album is so boring it should be recommended to cure sleeplessness. I'm not exaggerating either. Don't waste the $15 on this C.D.
5,Cholesterol Protection For Life - Great Book for Great Health,"My husband followed the advice in this book to lower his elevated LDL cholesterol score. He dropped it from 135 to 98. We have since recommended the book to several people, many of whom have followed its advice with similar results. It works!"
2,"Vermeer, Deceptive","Vermeer, I can't believe it, What you should have done to deserve a good book?, kill somebody as Caravaggio, commit suicide as Van Gogh, die at 37 as Raphael, please ...!Texts in the book are extremely obvious, format is not adequate to store in common shelves, I think that knowing his small production (about 36 paintings) the author should have incorporated technical analylis, zooms, materials, etc.If you are a painter, you still have to wait, look into the Web, there are lots of good information about this discriminated painter ..."
4,Vermeer: A Visual Treat,"This book offers a wonderful opportunity for those Vermeer lovers who were not fortunate enough to view the National Gallery of Art exhibit in 1995. A brief but informative overview of Vermeer's life is provided, along with large format reproductions of all of his existing works. Inlcuded in each description is the location of each work, along with the dimensions of the original. While my goal is to see all the Vermeers on display, this is a great reference companion. I keep it on my coffee table and refer to it often. It's a treasure."
3,Completely inadequate,"Completely inadequate. Many of the reproductions are too dark, and important details can't be seen. In many pictures there are small white dots, obviously the result of poor printing. In the magnificent ""Servant Handing Her Lady a Letter,"" the dyes have dripped so badly that the reproduction might as well be a comic book. Abrams should be miles above this level of quality. The photo editor, Uta Hoffman, should have an eye exam."
4,Purchase of Patsy Cline's Heartaches,"The quality of the Heartaches CD was flawless and new, straight out of the package. My only complaint is that the case was badly cracked. Thankfully, I had another Heartaches CD that was broken, and my case was flawless, so I simply switched my case for the case that arrived and now it looks as good as new. The CD itself was perfect. I would definitely buy from this seller again. Misty"
2,Dissapointed,"Does not sound like original, early Cline. Sounds more like late 60's early 70's music. Dissapointed!"
1,The BORING Life of Catherine M.,"This book was so monotonous I couldnt even finish it. So what, she let a lot of guys f*** her, you can go to your local swingers club and see that. ZZZZZZZZZZZ, put me to sleep. Clara Bow's sexual life was much more detailed, wild, riske',and in some cases criminal, in short actually worth writing about."
1,Numbingly dreary,"Millet's sexual life is just a rambling catalogue of sexual acts. She is fooling herself if she thinks she is revolutionary or shocking. She obviously believes in quantity over quality and sex to her is all about the act rather than the emotion. Maybe something is lost in translation. There is nothing interesting about any of the encounters, no humor even, just a rather depressing account. It reads like a rather gory medical experiment. Yes, it is an accurate title but if you want some good erotica, try ""The Butcher"""
2,Too Detached to Engage,"Everybody has a friend or someone they know how loves to brag about their sexual encounters. At first they're interesting, then repititious and tiresome, then unbelievable.This book was like listening to that guy or girl.Living in a GIRLS GONE WILD era, where just about every girl under 25 looks drunk, tattooed and totally slutty, it's hard to feel there is anything unique about this memoir: beach parties and spring breaks provide daily debaucheries on a wide scale.I also questioned the credibility of this book when it comes to diseases: anyone so reckless would've surely picked up something! I have friends with only a few party indiscretions who found themselves infected with herpes, so for Ms. Millet to drone on and on about long lines of strangers without a word about any infection at all sounds dishonest.The more she writes of her sexual escapades, the more detached and removed she appears from herself."
2,"Rather dull, all things considered","This book can keep one's interest for about the first 100 pages, but that's about it. After that, you will have become thoroughly maddened by her writing style. You will find out by that point that she's not going to tell you very much about herself other than she likes/liked sex a lot, and as one other reviewer wrote, the letters in American men's magazines are better. As for the reviewer in Switzerland who thinks it's the best piece of erotica he/she has ever read, Switzerland must not have much."
1,She is fooling herself,"While promoted as a no-holds-barred feminist track on sexuality, I found this book to be a very sad account of a woman's search for identity and meaning. Sprinkled throughout the long narratives on group sex and sex with strangers, are clues to her lack of self esteem and her disappointment in sex. From her molestation as a pre-pubescent girl to one long-term partner telling her she had a so-so face but a great [butt], I think Millet is fooling herself if she believes the life she has led has not scarred her. The sexually transmitted disease, the abortion, and having ""lovers"" who pass you to strangers are not sexy. For crying out loud the woman wasn't sure what an orgasm felt like was after years of group sex. I was unable to enjoy the eroticism in the book because I could not get past the self-debasement of the author."
1,"Like Millet Herself, this Book Sucks","What does it take for an average looking woman to attract a great number of men for a variety of sexual expressions. Not much -- she just has to be willing. Men must be clever or rich or charming or whatever, but a woman just has to show up. So, since she is supposed to be a writer and an intellectual, I was hoping for interesting views from that perspective, or at least above average tittilation. No such luck. Fortunately, I borrowed the book. It was returned clean."
2,Should have listened to the other reviewers,"I read several reviews that told future customers to skip this book. I should have listened. The writing was poorly done and confusing. There was no passion to anything that the author did, it was robotic and just made me sad for her. This 'liberation"" of her just came across as low self esteem."
1,Terrible! Don't waste you rtime with this trash,"Quite simply the worst book I have ever picked up. It is boring, pathetic, dysfunctional and the list goes on and on. I can't comprehend the positive reviews, the writing is terrible, and there's not even a trace of eroticism.The book should have been entitled Memoirs of an Unattractive Hole Stuffer. It really is that bad.Makes me feel sorry for men and women that stoop that low. This is the dregs. Worse than sleazy."
1,The Sexual LIfe of Catherine M.,"I have never been moved to write a review until now. Save your money! This is a terribly, terribly boring book of disjointed ramblings of a very sad woman. It is not or even the least bit erotic or interesting. Skip it, period."
1,Terrible Read,I couldn't get past the 3rd chapter. I feel pain and sorrow for Catherine M. that she has so much emotional pain and disrespect for her body=TherapyI was on a flight and put this book down to read the Inflight magazine which was more interesting then this book
1,A Waste of Money,"If one seeks to buy a book about sex, it should either be erotic or informative, or both. This is neither. The woman's sex life is basically that of a blow up doll - she basically makes herself available to anyone who wants it and is so detached from emotion and thought that one wonders whether she enjoyed any of her experiences. As a reader, I could not. That's when I could decipher the bad writing. Sentences and paragraphs flow on without any indication of organisation and the writing is bad. OK, you might think, at least it could be erotic. It's not. Don't waste your money."
2,Lacks True Insight,"Some have termed this book courageous for its inside look into the free (of responsibility and emotion) sexual life of a woman. I plunked down $ hoping to gain some unique insight into the emotional consequences of such a lifestyle and perhaps learn something I could apply to my own life. Instead, I felt like a voyeur who was only treated to the mechanical/physical side of a strange wanderlust with no insight into emotion or inner transformation. It provided neither insight nor erotica if one is looking for that. I have read novels such as Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin that force a more thoughtful examination of one's relationships and self-concept, and which hit home very personally."
4,Reviewing the Reviews,"I read the book, which was entertaining and informative, and then read the Amazon customer reviews which for the most part are almost frantically negative for reasons that seem like transparent manifestations of the insecurities of the reviewers rather than objective judgments of the qualities of the book. To me, to call the author's uncoventional sex life ""boring"" is absurd. It makes as much sense as calling a seriel killer's autobiography boring because it recounts doing the same thing over and over again. This is not great literature, but it deserves a better fate than the reviews it has received."
1,Without taste or plot,"I purchase _The Sexual Life of Catherine M._ out of curiosity. I sincerely regret it. It has been compared to the works of the Marquis de Sade. What a joke. This fails horribly as erotica AND as philosophy. It's not giving anyone any insight into anything. I found it hard to believe, and if this is true, how can anyone take the author seriously. I mean, come on, it jumps from her coldly-regarded orgies to ""I love to ..."". It's a waste. If this was amazing, ground-breaking etc, when she wrote it, something was lost in translation. And no, that's not just an ignorant American speaking out of jealousy or whatever. Not by a long shot. You can find better in letters to ""gentlemen's magazines."" Skip this one."
1,wow,"What can I say? I absolutely wanted to regurgitate this book...metaphorically and physically. It was raunchy, emotionless porn. I wouldn't recommend it to even the most adventurous reader."
1,Disappointing,"The proposal seemed very interesting at first and the book's review gave the impression that it was about the sexual history of somebody who had lived its sexuality at the up most and have something to share with us about it.However, the book fails to deliver that. It seems more the result of the author's fertile imagination than the register of real history.She managed to turn the narrative timeless (it's not possible to know when the facts happened and at what age), the names may have been changed for privacy purposes and the link between one history and other sometimes is quite confusing.The bottom line is that what regards a reflection about human sexuality this book adds nothing to the discussion."
3,Interesting but could have gone further,"The writer is superb in digesting and observing herself and her own sexual exploits, but I felt it didn't really go deep enough. It was fun and stimulating to read about how she went about having so much sex, sex with strangers, women, groups, but it began to drag for me. Too much about the sex and not enough about the woman or the lover she was. Though it was really interesting the perspective she described at times and she writes beautifully well and was very philosophical in her approach of the book."
1,"Not at all erotic...nameless, faceless orgies.","I bought this book in hopes of reading something liberated and erotic. In fact it is descriptions of orgy after orgy, no character building, no plot...who cares? This women degraded herself, left herself completely vulnerable to STD's and never describes any satisfaction she gets from these sordid endeavors.I didn't even finish it, a waste of time."
3,"Strangely Detached, Perhaps.",This book was a quick read but I'm not sure what I know now that I didn't before I read it. The title is sufficiently self-descriptive. I would think that I would be very interested in such a detailed look at that sex life of a beautiful woman with a lot of experience. But she seems strangely detached from much of her sex life and that leaves the reader somewhat detached also. I wonder if a woman's orgasm is just so difficult to write about or it just doesn't matter that much to them.
1,who thought sex could be this dull?,"considering that sex should be about as interesting a topic as there is, it really is amazing how so many writers can make it sooooo dull. are orgies really about as interesting as roofing a house? reading this author, it sure seems like it. what a disappointment this book was. not once did i achieve wood status while reading it. horrible. horrible. horrible. about as bad a book as i've ever read."
2,yeah right!!!,"I,m sorry, I know we are supposed to take most books at face value, assume they are real; I do not doubt the encounters in this book, I doubt her descriptions of her feelings, there is absolutely no way that you can feel nothing after being f**ked by twenty men on the same night... give me a break, if you wanted to maintain your dignity you should not presume to write a tell all of sexual orgies you have participated in. The only people who could possibly see this book as relevant are sexually immature adolescents."
3,I Love Sexy Books,"This is a sexy book on one woman's sexual exploration. I enjoyed it. I am now reading Diary of a Sex Fiend: The Girl with a One Track Mind, which is in the same genre and very good. I recommend both."
5,If you love sex . . .,". . . then you'll love this book. Catherine goes into amazing detail. You can tell she has given herself to this subject--physically, mentally, and spiritually. I'm a man, .... and it's equally pleasurable to get inside a woman's head (as Catherine M. allowed me to do by reading her book).Not only did I find it immesely pleasurable (...), but I also found it to be mentally and spiritually satisfying."
3,The Sexual Life of Cathrine M.,"This is one of those books that you either love or hate. I love it, probably because I see myself in some of her descriptions. But not because of this, I suggest to all the female readers to read it, just to get a rough idea of their sexual life compering it to Cathrine Mellet's. And a little bit about the autor: I definately look up to her, not because of her, as some may say, promiscuous sex life; but because she found that strenght in her to write this revealing and very personal book. For many women this type of hings may be hard to write even in thier diaries, however to share it the world...a great courage is needed to do that."
3,Misleading,"I thought I was purchasing the Tapco Multi-Angle Table as pictured, BUT NO this table has no legs!! The snap stand, wheels, and extended top pictured are an additional $370. There is no manual or further instructions to tell you that the other items are not included. Have not used the tool yet in order to rate it. Am optimistic about its value and performance though. Would appreciate a discount or coupon from Amazon to compensate for misleading web page.Regards, Chris BornmanP.S. Had to enter a star rating to get this to send. Not accurate because have yet to use the tool. Waiting for legs."
3,All About Stone Worship,For tens of thousands of years humans have worshiped stones in various ways. They've carved stone and prayed to stone and built empires with it. In Secret Societies and Sacred Stones we're given detailed information through interviews with experts and many photos and footage. Why did people of the past covet certain stones and what did they feel they could achieve by harnessing its power? Some felt stones could steal your soul while others believed they could protect against evil. Fascinating stuff! I suggest watching this DVD then the director's movie The Stone since it will make even more sense and be that much scarier!
2,"lots of space, but too slow","This drive puts 4GB of space in a very cool, small package; but writing to it is painfully slow. For example, copying a 350MB file to the drive took a minute and 43 seconds. Thats only 3.4MB/sec. In the same test, a SanDisk Cruzer was more than twice as fast (47 seconds). So, if you want to fill this drive be prepared to wait almost 20 minutes for the copy to finish."
1,Seriously???,"This is an awful addition to the puppet master, & demonic toys movies. The toys in the movie look like they were assembled in like 2 minutes with some cheap scrap plastic. Fullmoon just doesnt put anything in to their movies anymore.This is a disgrace to the other movies.If this movie were made in the 90's like the original series, it would probably have been fantastic. Don't even bother with this movie, its not worth your time."
2,Another VS movie.....,"Im a REALLLLLLL big fan of the Puppet Master Legacy so far until this, this had some BEAUTIFUL women and the puppets thats about it lol.The acting was terrible and most of the story is predictable. The main boy from The Goonies plays the scientist did a suprisingly annoying job and its safe to see why we aint seen him in many movies since The Goonies....this movie could of been a real good movie or atleast good enough for some people to recomise it as a cult movie, but instead i can see this being forgotten, added to the most terrible movies ever list or sold at a Gas station for $3.95"
1,unwatchable,"This movie was a severely bad. Corey Feldmen was terrible. This movie can't even fall under the so bad it's good category. If you are wondering if its worse than curse of the puppetmaster, the answer is without a doubt yes."
3,"Not Terrific, But Not Horrible","I absolutely adore Puppet Master so this movie gave me high hopes. While it didn't live up to those 'high' hopes as I'd wanted, it was still a decent watch. The acting in it was...to say the least, had a 'forced' and almost amateur appeal to it which brought down the already low budget feel it gave off.But I have to admit it was nice seeing the classic Puppets back in action again...even with the upgrades."
1,couldn't finish it,"This sucked so BAD. I tried twice to watch it and ended up shutting it off not even half way through. Not surprisingly Full Moon Pictures didnt produce this one. Which is obivously why it sucks and is not a legit entry to either series. Most of the puppets/toys dont look anything close to the originals. I cant believe Corey Feldman was in something like this, hes better than that. Charles Band himself called the film Non-Canon because it was not made by him. Not worth renting, buying or watching on tv. Avoid at all costs!!!"
3,o.k.,"the women were hot, the baby toy funny as all hell!- the ending horrible, the women playing the cop horrible, corey feldman did a great job acting i dont care what the other reviewers here said. the problem is the director and writer did not write a good script and did not write the movie great for him or his daughter or the puppetmaster and demonic toys who are supposed to be scary, but turn out to be funny as hell! feldman tryed to hard to play the part, but the script was horrible."
1,solid presentation,"The author ofCrossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedypresents here a power point lecture documenting his decades as a journalist covering the assassination of JFK and his participation in the making ofJFK. It is a welcome edition to my DVD collection on the JFK caseChuck Ochelli""The Blind JFK Researcher on Youtube"""
2,nothing special,"It's not that good of a book, it gives facts than entertainment. Print is small and light. If I had looked it before hand I wouldn't have bought it."
3,seated yoga,this video provides a very good introduction to yoga for people who are unable to assume the normal postures of yoga. it's gentle and easy paced and would be excellent for adding activity to a sedentary lifestyle.
3,Better quality needed,"I bought this back in July, but about two moths ago, it failed. It's a great enclosure case, but it would have been nice if it lasted more than 8 months.Pros: Doesn't get too hot, eSATA connector (with an additional bracket), USB and overall a decent design.Cons: Bulky power adapter, leaves a lot of fingerprints on case, no warranty info specified and it failed under less than a year.But thanks to Amazon, the product will be replaced. Let's just hope it will last longer."
1,DON'T BUY - WARRANTY SUCKS!,"You may notice there's no warranty info. in the Product Description---That's because they don't want you to know it, to include in your purchase decision. It's even ""buried"" on the Vantec Web site.Product is prone to failure before long after it's 1 year warranty.A better choice is SIIG with 5 year warranty, and great customer service; or Star Tech which at least a 2 year warranty."
5,A perfect hard-drive enclosure!,"This is an excellent product, with a first-class design, both in its operation and in its classy appearance. It has a very small footprint in the vertical position. I have it sitting on a 1/2 inch styrofoam pad, which I do as a matter of course with drives of this sort in order to lessen any vibration effects. However, there are none at all; it is impossible, either by sound or feel, to detect that the drive is running.It was very easy to install a 500gb Seagate Barracuda SATA drive, which of course required formatting before use. After formatting, the drive worked as expected, with no fussing or fiddling. Most important, the fan-less aluminum enclosure runs very cool. The warmest surface temperature which I measure using a laser spot thermometer (in an ambient surrounding of 75 degrees F) is 95 degrees F.All pros and no cons!!"
3,Nice enclosure - marketing claims of SATA 3.0gb not true,"The reason I bought this case is to build my own ""super fast"" eSATA drive. I also bought an eSATA 3.0gb drive as well as a PCI-E card. I have tried many compbinations but I cannot get the drive work in 3.0gb mode. The only way to make it work is to jumper the hdd to 1.5gb. So, if you have a HDD drive and a PCI card that are 3.0Gb compatible, this enclosure will limit your drive's speed to 1.5Gb. It is a really nice enclosure, made with professional grade materials, but if you are looking for the top speed this one will not cut it."
3,Does the Job,"I would recommend this item. The only problem I've had with it was that the hard drive comes loose from time to time and loses connection. Having to go through the process of dismantling and reassembling can be annoying, but afterwards it works fine. The noise is from my hard drive and not the item. Other than that it's a great piece that does the job."
4,It's a case for a hard drive.,"I'm not exactly how you can go right or wrong with a product like this. It's an external case for a SATA disk. It looks pretty cool, the lights and the case are nice. I believe it support external SATA but I use the USB.I haven't had any issues with the drive getting overly hot and malfunctioning or anything along those lines."
3,Question,I have data i need in an internal drive that is Ultra ATA. I would like to know if i can use the case and use the data in this internal drive without formatting it.
5,This is the standard case I use whenever I need another USB external drive,"I have about 6 or 7 USB drives around the office and some more at home. Vantec's products have served me well since the IDE days. This one is for SATA and it works just fine.Easy to install, has a nice understated look that's not too garish.From time to time, I try to experiment and buy other brands, but I always regret it and come back to Vantec's tried-and-true enclosure."
1,NO WORKIE,"Windows 7 nor my Windows XP recognize the unit. Worked with my ""IT"" department to no avail. Have not contacted the company for their suggestions as of yet. In defence of this product, I purchased another brand and get the same results. In surfing the web it seems everyone using the usb interface is having problems with sata harddrives."
5,Great enclosure,"I do not think anyone should look any further.Top looks, top operation, no fan, switching power supply.Can not think about any downsides.Led is a little too brite but you do not like it - do not connect it :)"
3,Not accessible after wakeup from standby,"This drive looks very nice. I own another Vantec drive of a different model. Both of them have the same way to install a hard drive. After several screws, you are done. Here are the pros and cons of the drive.PROS:1. Looks great. Build quality is good.2. Has eSATA support.3. After hours of use, the case is only warm. I know it also has something to do with the drive. But I think the aluminum case works to dissipate the heat, too.CONS:1. Drive is not accessible after wakeup from standby on Windows. This is the biggest problem. I then have to turn off the drive and turn it back on. With this, I will not buy this enclosure again. But if you don't keep the drive on all the time like me, this is not an issue.2. Price. It is a little on the high-end side. But I really like the build quality. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,FANTASTICE DRIVE ENCLOSURE - GOOD $$ VALUE,"Most likely I have more than 10 drive enclosures. I have been using them for years. When I install a drive in some of them, I call a friend for help. Some are poorly designed. I like a simple design so that I can swap drives and enclosures quickly. The NexStar has two external screws and a solid, not 2 piece case. Remove 2 screws on the case and 4 on the HD mount. It takes about 2 minutes. I purchased a unit that had outputs for Firewire 800, Firewire 400, USB and eSata. And it came will ALL the cables, including one adaptor. The case is beautifully finished aluminum for cool operation. The USB, eSata version comes with an eSata bracket for your desktop case. It seems like an expensive unit but providing all cables make the price reasonable."
3,"Works, but pricey and poor quality","Pro:Slim, form-fitting, looks nice without being too flashy/ugly. Has eSATA output.Con:It's kind of expensive for a simple enclosure. The drilled screw holes that secure the faceplate to the body is drilled off-axis. They didn't align the drill correctly, and the drilled screw hole is crooked. Too much hassle to return it, and the screw still fits in there (though it's really really tight to take the screw in and out), but it's just too bad they couldn't do something as simple of drilling a screw hole correctly.I have another enclosure made by AnyWare, which is cheaper than this and looks exactly like this vantech one except for the face plate. Everything else is identical. They must get it from the same OEM. The Anyware one was cheaper."
2,Title explained,"The 60 in the title refers to Her Majesty's age at the time of filming in 1986, not the number of years since becoming Queen."
3,Ummmmm! does anyone check their dates!,"Ahhhemmm! At the risk of being a pedant...at time of writing, Her Majesty has been Queen for 50, not 60 years! (or perhaps the guys at the video company are rather more forward thinking (by 10 years) that I had imagined!Eamonn"
1,sorry to have purchased,very hard to see the screen. Instructions are not user friendly. Will never recommend this product to a friend
5,Lighthouse Life,"Norma Engel tells the story of her parents, Hermann and Freda who tended the Point Bonita Light Station, the Oakland Harbor Light Station and the Ballast Point Light Station during the early days of the US Lighthouse Service."
1,cute but not practical,"I bought this for my daughter because she asked for a camera for Christmas. It was cute and not expensive. After one day of trying to work with it, I went out and spent a little more to get a better quality, more user friendly camera."
1,Not good for anyone!!!!!!!,Don't even bother with this product! It is not user friendly. I bought it for my 3-year-old but I could not even figure the thing out. It has too many settings for being a child's camera. I would not recommend this one at all. Buyer beware!
2,too little,"First impression of this CD-Rom is that there's too little information. It took only a few minutes to go thru.This is a commercial real estate transaction. Everyone knows or at least thinks that there are more than residential real estate transactions involved.I'm in residential real estate now and trying to expand my field into commercial arena. This cd-rom was unfortunately not useful and not worth for money.Books like ""How to suceed in commercial real estate"", ""Commercial real estate investing"", and ""Secrets of millionaire real estate developer"" (if you are interested in development too), are much worth to purchase.One technical thing. Audio quality of some footages was poor."
2,Conversations? Monologues more likely.,"Readers of Marai's masterpiece Embers (see my review) may expect lengthy, unrealistic, but totally gripping dialogues in this work also; but whereas that artifice worked very well in the other book, here it is for the most part tedious and repetitive. The central monologue, 60 pages long, is an almost uninterrupted one, with paragraphs of eight or eleven pages, and only the last monologue, which runs for some 37 pages, builds up a powerful momentum and develops a psychologically profound analysis of Casanova's personality - and perhaps of the personalities of other people who are afraid of committing themselves to truly loving relationships. I was several times tempted to abandon the book before I had reached this penultimate chapter. In the end I was glad I did not."
5,A Hauntingly Good Book!,"I was in Barnes & Noble and was walking past the new fiction section and just happened to pick up this book. It wasn't on sale and I had never heard anything about it nor had I heard of the author. So I took a chance and decided to go ahead and pay full price (which I never do)! Suffice it to say, I have not been disappointed. This book is sooooo good. It's a slow, mystical kind of read. It's also shocking, lyrical, and very enlightening. There's one scene, when Kambili goes upstairs to the bathroom to see what her father wants with her, and I was totally caught off guard. I will be recommending this novel to all of my friends, family, and of course, my book club. For anyone who is a parent, I would definitely recommend this book. I hope to one day meet the author."
5,As unique and beautiful as the title suggests,"No wonder Chinua Achebe is delighted by Chimamanda Adichie. And no wonder she can dare weave his legendary title into her story's open. Chimamanda Adichie has a very special writing talent -- raw yet also subtly refined. Her story reads the way incredible dancers dance -- convincingly, passionately, honestly, and seemingly, without any effort. ""Purple Hibiscus"" is insightful, fresh, honest, real. If you like Haitian writer Edwidge Dandicott (whose work I adore!), especially ""Krik Krak,"" I think you'll also like Chimamanda Adichie."
5,"""Intricately Cultural and Exposing""","The innocent child's view shown here of how culture, religion and politics meddle with a society such as modern day Nigeria. Expresses more than the eye reads in detail and complexity as culture enslaves a Nigerian perspective towards every other aspect of life. ""Exposes what is yet to said or shown"". A must read book."
4,Engrossing storytelling,"Adichie takes any non-African reader into an enthralling fictional world without compromising anything about the context, history and sensibility of Nigerian life. She achieves this through sharp, immediate characterization and a strong storyline. It's not a ""difficult"" book - it's a total page-turner - but it packs a great deal of complexity beneath its apparently simple surface. When you finish this slim novel, you know you've been somewhere."
5,riveting reading,"I bought this book a few months ago, Iwas riveted from the first line. Very good reading, excellent writing by this young author. I looked for other books by this author and found Half A Yellow Sun which was even better than Purple Hibiscus. I learned a lot about Nigeria and the civil war. I also learned some nigerian words. Great great writing by this young author."
2,Dreary dark tale...,"I had every intention of wanting to love this book but will alone wouldn't suffice. It is dreary, seemingly long for it's relative size. Until the very end Kambali and her mother come across as weak and needy women enduring endless beatings while continuing to have a twisted reverence for their husband/father. The story has a depressing flatline rhythm. One that would be better to get from the library or wait for paperback."
2,"Easy read, a very ""visual"" novel, could have gone deeper","As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows. To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper. It stayed very ""surface level"" with me, reads almost like a ""young adult"" novel. Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it."
5,Wonderful debut,"Chiamanda is one to be reckoned with and this book just makes me feel nostalgic about my childhood.Descriptions and scenery that make you feel like you were watching a movie, not reading a book"
4,"A new land, but a familiar life . . .","This is a wonderful book by a native author. Tale spun with realism and empathy. Told in the voice of a young privileged girl in Nigeria, a girl who follows without question the teachings of her Catholic father, who enforces his messages with physical abuse. You live through her longings, her doubts and yet her unfailing belief. A trip with her brother to visit her aunt brings her an understanding of a different, more empowering way of life. She learns now to laugh for the first time of her life, and yes, she even finds love. Traveling with her brings out your own doubts (especially if you were raised Catholic), but also helps you find your own center. The events that buffet this young girl bring doubt, excitement and finally a sense of certainly to her life. You'll love the trip."
4,Purple Hibiscus,"Two thumbs up for this story told from an African perspective. Kambili the shy young Nigerian girl, and her brother, Jaja, are from a well-to do family that includes their submissive mother, Beatrice and tyrant father, Eugene. Eugene, a staunch Catholic, rules with a heavy hand and his family is slow to disappoint him. While on a visit to their Aunt and cousins, Kambili and Jaja get to see life the way the other half lives and these experiences transform Kambili and Jaja from sheltered ""rich kids"" into young adults with voices and minds of their own. There are so many other layers to this story, though - religion, politics, wealth/middle class, young love, abuse. This was quite a find for me and a very enjoyable read. A solid four star! I look forward to reading more work from this author."
3,purple hibiscus,The Book was is good shape and arrived in due time. It was a quick read...interesting. Was read as a book club selection.
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book because (if I recall correctly) it was long-listed for last years ManBooker Prize and also, (this I recall) because it had good reviews here on Amazon. Anyway, I was real disappointed. I quit paying attention after page 100 and quit outright a few pages later. I found the contrasting aspects of the Father's character interesting but after awhile so contrasting they felt way off reality. Character of aunt, cousin, priest, mom etc etc also grew gratingly ""perfect."" This may be excessive, but after a while I felt like I was reading a bit of sophisticated version of a teen romance novel. The comparisons with God of Small Things are seriously unflattering to Roy's great book. Comparisons with (the overrated) Memoirs of a Geisha or (also not finished) One Thousand Chestnut Trees would have been more appropriate."
2,The Igbo Man with Power.,"This book was a bit of a disappointment storywise. It was very slow to get going. What was up with the father? Did he have a psychological disease? Why did he have such little empathy for his family? Was it supposed to be because he was so stressed out by the evil government that he had to take it out on the powerless people who loved him? The father was a monster who was equally as bad as the vile government. Does he represent a typical Igbo man with power? The angelic priest was not an Igbo, was he? The ending was bad. Did the son or the mother do it? Either one doing it makes them equally as bad as the father. The author couldnt make up her mind. The son must have done it, cause the premise of the book is that Igbo men with power are evil. Nice that the evil government allows the 3 of them to inherit all of Bad Daddy's money to squander as they wish and live happily ever after without Bad Daddy around."
1,Disappointing,"I appreciated Adichie's exploration into the everyday of a traditional Nigerian family; it is easy to form a picture in one's mind. However, I expected more. I came away thinking and feeling ""is this it?"". The book seemed to lack a certain substance.Anyhow, I am proud of her accomplishments and have her other book ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" waiting to be read. I hope it is better!"
3,problem with the father character,"I found the book to be a compelling but not lovable book. The father seems like two different people--the horribly strict and abusive parent/husband, on the one hand, and the brave advocate for democracy and press freedom on the other. It's not clear why the father became the super strict parent he became. Instead, his Catholicism is left to explain it all. I would resent that sort of slight of hand if I were Catholic, and I regret it as the reader. The fact that the author never attempts to reconcile the two sides of the father's personality is, in my opinion, a major weakness in what is otherwise a well written book."
4,abuse,Well written. Written from the viewpoint of a teenage girl. Abusive father. I only hope American readers will not confuse severe abuse in this family with general cultural norms in Nigeria.
3,Good but not Great,"Being the product of Igbo parents and wanting to learn more about my culture, I decided to read the book. It was a very sweet book, but as others commented on it is for pre-teen's to early teens.In the end, I recommmend that others borrow this book..."
1,What's with the sexy DVD boxcover?,"OK, I'm an idiot for thinking that the sexy DVD boxcover showing two beautiful oriental women entwined together had anything whatsoever to do with what was actually in this film. Whoever designed the cover knew that such an illustration would lead to people such as myself purchasing this DVD in the hopes that lesbian erotica was a key feature of this video.Instead, what I got was a boring cop-drama with very little girl/girl interaction and what amounted to a complete waste of my time and money. In summation: it's a mediocre video with an incredibly hot DVD cover illustration. You've been warned. Sadly, I was not."

2,Bad color,"The color is stupid. I ordered 2 cartridges. One is more on blue, and the other is more on pink color."
5,Excellent replacement cartridges.,"These cartridges are an excellent replacement for the much more expensive hp cartridges. Initially there was a minor problem with the cartridge that I received, however once the vendor was contacted they promptly and completely addressed my concerns.I have nothing but good things to say about dealing with the vendor, and these cartridges."
4,I am happy with my purchase,It works and I think I will buy another HP C6578A/C6578AN/C6578DN(HP 78) Remanufactured Inkjet Cartridge Tri-Color for HP DeskJet 952C/Office
5,HP 78 that Works!!!,I have tried many HP 78 color refill cartidges with mixed results. This one WORKS GREAT which means I will be back for more very soon. My printer is an old HP Deskjet 932C.
1,You'll be sorry to buy this junk from this seller,"I would like to give a zero star if I could. I bought this HP78 ink cartridge and found the yellow and green ink has been dried for a long time when the package was first open. All the color prints look pinkish red. I tried to contact the seller through the Amazon email system because they ""guarantee the quality"". The seller never responded. I have to toss this one in trash and feel real sorry that I bought this junk cartridge from this irresponsible seller. I should have read and listened to the other negative comments that preceded my comment. If you think this reduced price is cheap, stop, it is not cheap for a useless cartridge. You can get a much better one for the same price from other sources. Again, I strongly recommend that buyers beware, this product is a piece of real junk and the seller will play deaf ear with you!"
1,Work for one page.... .,"I always buy refurbished ink cartridges. They are cheaper so I save money. They are refurbished so are as close to ""green"" as a cartridge can be. I most often buy the cheapest that I can find on Amazon. I had no expectations for this as I expected it to work. It worked on one printing of a one page document. The next time I needed it then all the printing was pink. Horrible..."
1,It doesn't work the red color and the blue is very light,"I bought 2 cartridges one works fine, but the second works like if it was empty on the red and it has a waterd down blue.I did buy remanufactured cartridges before and didn't have any problems with those."
3,Good Cheap Bag,"You get what you pay for. For $17, this is a durable cheap bag. It is not leather. Made in Pakistan. And the straps are very cheap 'school bag' type straps. But the most important aspect, it gets the job done!"
4,Excellent,"There is an interesting story behind the 9th Symphony, besides the well-known one that Dvorak supposedly gathered the material for this work while he was temporarily in the U.S. directing the Curtiss Insitute. This great symphony is a classic example of a work that almost comes to ruination because of the over-inventiveness and ingenuity of the composer. The work almost completely loses integration and explodes, but not quite. Funny thing was, Dvorak won a composing competition when he was still very young. The committee noted that he was extremely talented, but one of the members, I think it was Brahms himself, said Dvorak would need to learn to control and discipline his talent. Then Dvorak writes this symphony many years later as a mature composer and again it almost gets away from him--sort of interesting given Brahms' earlier comment."
5,Outstanding Book!,It provides a clear and concise summary of the Gospel. I am a deacon in the Catholic Church and I use it for both homily preparation and teaching. It uses plain english to present what many complicate.
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book because I was particularly taken with authorLuke Johnson's ""Reading Romans"" and because I was equally delighted with the first book I purchased in the Sacra Pagina series, ""John"" by F. Maloney.The commentary seems a bit thin in this volume to me, and I found it distracting that each section of the book presents first the scriptural passage to be discussed, then notes on the translation second, and finally the commentary. For me, this broke the cadence of the text -- inserting the ""end notes"" between the passage and the analysis -- and made the book feel more like a companion guide to a text on learning historical Greek.Sad to say, as much as I enjoyed this book's thorough discussion, I took away more understanding and a more cohesive sense of Luke's Gospel from reading the one chapter about Luke in Raymond Brown's last work on the New Testament. I looked to Sacra Pagina to provide a more in-depth exegetical and hermeneutic commentary.... and it did."
4,Emergency Nursing - 5-Tier Triage Protocals,Very good resource - especially for taining new triage nurses.Easy to read and follow.
1,NOT for neoprene dumbells!,Do not order this product if you have any neoprene dumbbells. They simply will not fit.
3,Just okay....,"I was expecting more from this book. Yes, it did contain some great info, but it was so dry and quite frankly, boring at some points, it took forever to get through, and I wouldn't want to read it again. It does have a godd index about gods/goddesses in the back, but this is not for pleasure reading at all. If you enjoy reading manuels and textbooks, you will enjoy it more than I did."
5,BEST QUALITY MADE IN USA,"This saw means accuracy, and it is made her my friend in USA.Pros: Accurate, Great capacity, fine cuts, not too heavy, no to light,laser and light are ok...nothing is perfect.Cons:Hard to read the miter scale, fence should be taller.There no such a thing as perfection, and this is a Great so, It is better than the ""full of cheap plastic Bosch Made in China"". It is very strong, and accurate at the same time.I have used it to cut crown, chair rail, casing, baseboards, shelves,etc..and it works great. MADE IN USA."
5,Go to Home Depot now!,"I just picked this saw up at home depot. I have been wanting one for a long time. Amazon's price just went up from 479.99. Home Depot had the saw for 499.99 for a long time. I just happen to stop by this evening at it was marked 399.99. Awesome deal considering it is over 500 here on Amazon. Go there now, not sure how long it will be that price."
5,Mighty Makita!,"The Makita LS 1013FL has great lineage! I bought the original LS 1013 (no laser, no fluorescent light) years ago and it has been a rock solid performer, cutting everything from trim to deck framing. Through it all, that saw never needed one day in a repair shop. The 1013 series has been consistently at the top of ratings in professional magazines and in online reviews by professionals. No wonder two thirds of all buyers on Amazon pick the Makita slider. Nothing else is even close.The laser and light are nice upgrades, but what makes the saw special was there from the start: a bed that's light to carry, but solid for work, bearings that stay true year after year, a smooth slider action, a soft start, direct drive motor, a good price, and it's made in the USA! This last point grows more and more important as jobs continue going overseas.This is a great saw! A slider costs more, but it does everything, and does it well!"
5,Makita LS1013FL Compound Mitre Saw,"Seems to work very well. I'm no pro, just a weekend warrior. It's easy to use and well thought out. I'm glad I purchased it."
1,Saw arrived damaged---Need a replacement,Saw arrived damaged but sat unopened for a month. Now damage is apparent. How do I RMA and get a new saw sent out? Please advise immediately.
4,Bevel won't return to 0 properly,"Nice saw overall, but the bevel detent is junk. Depending on whether you're returning the saw to 0 from the left or the right, the blade will be up to 2 degrees off zero - meaning I have to check it with a square every time. Inexcusable, from a saw in this class."
5,Makita LS1013FL 15 Amp 10-Inch Dual Bevel Compound Sliding Miter,"THIS IS THE BEST SAW I EVER OWNED,IT WILL MAKE ALL KINDS OF ANGLE CUTS AND SAFER AND MORE ACCURATE THAN A TABLE SAW.ADD IN THE PRICE FROM AMAZON AND A HECK OF A DEAL"
5,advanced amateur woodworker,"I found the saw to be in excellent condition out of the box. It works very well, meeting all my needs to make household furniture for myself and my family and friends. Now my wife wants crown molding in our bedroom!"
2,Not for True Scholars of Video Games,"As a scholar of video game research and a graduate student in Anthropology I was extremely curious and happy to get a copy of this book to include in my library. I was however extremely disappointed. This book presented numerous problems and oversights of video games in general. Although there are many areas covered, none of them are covered in any serious depth or scholarly attention. Too often, Berger makes personal comments (typically negative) without backing them up. When comparing books to video games and other narrative forms, he really splits hairs in trying to bring out differences. His compartmentalization on the subject is extremely artificial and disturbing. The typos and spelling errors are enough to keep a reader frustrated. Even if you are not a scholar of video games, I would not recommend this book. There are numerous other books out there that are better written and look at video games on a much more even level."
2,Book Sorely Lacking,"The back of this book says that it begins with the tracing of the evolution of video games. However, any book that includes a history of games and doesn't include the names Baer, Bushnell, and Atari, is sorely lacking. Also, it would have been nice had Berger read the two definitive books on video games; Leonard Herman's Phoenix: The Fall & Rise of Videogames and Steven Kent's Ultimate History of Video Games. Instead, his source was J.C. Herz's Joystick Nation, a book that has been poorly received by the video gaming community."
1,Clumsy and shallow,"This is a clumsy work most notable for what it lacks rather than what it presents. Despite handy bullet points at the beginning of each chapter, one finds that half way through a chapter one must start again after the author reveals a hidden limitation such as only being concerned with games for children.I was disappointed with the way Berger allows his personal suppositions to dominate his arguments without any basis in either research or the existing literature (and occasionally with no basis is common sense). At one point Berger claims that playing video games means you are not interacting with family and friends; despite that he earlier included a set-up cost analysis for a system with two controllers (for 2 players).This book is of little academic interest, but may be suitable for media scare-mongering or to back up the dogma of certain interest groups."
3,A little too small at first use,"I used this for about one week before I returned my Nokia 6822 (see my review). The case was a little too small and I found myself always pushing it up so I could see the top of the screen and also for the camera lens. It fit ok, and I probably would have put up with it."
2,it sounded like a good idea but....,These specs are uncomfortable and akward to wear. The idea is clever but unfortunately but the reality is it just doesn't work well. I keep thinking maybe I need an instuction sheat because it seems like it oughta be a good thing but I pretty much already know how to wear glasses so I conclude that these are a miss.
1,Clicks glasses,Great idea but to small for many heads. The glasses can't be used on the bridge of the nose and looked over because the hoop is tight against the back of the head. Glad I didn't buy but one pair.
1,"ok for some, useless for others",This is a clever and stylish alternative design to the old way glasses are presented BUT despite expansion capability the glasses didn't fit 2 out of 3 persons we asked to try them on. How could a company sell these without accomodating people's various head sizes?
1,Too Small,"I have a large hat size - 7 5/8 - and these don't even come close to being usable. The glasses can't even come together because of this. Nice idea, but not eveyone has a small head size. I note someone else said the same thing with a 7 1/4 hat size. They are being returned."
3,cute but clumsy,"I've had laser eye surgery and being middle aged, need reading glasses. I usually wear them on my head and misplace them constantly. I didn't want to do the eyeglass chain thing - too old lady looking, so I tried these clics. They do work - clicking together, I mean. But when you are looking through them or take them off -they are clumsy and feel awkward.It is a nice idea, but in my case, it really didn't work."
1,Too small,"Too small!!!I was disappointed with the readers. Although they are ""adjustable"", they do not fit a normal adult head."
4,GREAT,I REALLY LIKE THEM BUT THEY WORK BETER FOR MEN WITH SHORT HAIR RATHER THAN A WOMEN WITH SHOULDER LENGTH HAIR
5,Most Amazing Invention Ever!,"I evangelize constantly - telling people about these amazing reading glasses! ""No, they're not broken. These things changed my life."" Too, these are a great conversation starter. (I also bought a pair of the CliC sunglasses.) No more do I buy pair after pair of readers - only to lose them or get them scratched up. It's no longer necessary to have a pair in the car, and a pair in all corners of the house. No longer do glasses hanging on a cord get tangled with my binocular strap. No longer to glasses sitting atop my head crash to the floor when I bend over. I bought two pair of Clic's; but,I've really only needed one."
4,These serve a purpose.,These Clics definitely fill a niche for me. Often times I don't have my jacket on or a shirt with a pocket. That leaves me without a good place to put my readers. I find my Clics to be quite useful also on the trout stream. It's nice to have easy access to your readers throughout the day.
4,Kids laugh but they work,"I was tired of losing my reading glasses in the classroom, so when I received the CliC glasses, this problem was solved. It took a while for my second grade students to get used to me ""breaking"" my glasses to put them on, but I no longer have to have a search party to find my missing glasses. Great idea!"
4,excellent for technical work!,"I lost my 1.5 clic readers and ordered a 2.5, was so happy to use them again at work! The only drawback is that they are hard to store, otherwise an excellent nerdy idea!"
5,Rengineering Reading Glasses,Excellent design: easy to use; hard to lose. They are also eye-catching & a great conversation piece. Add to that Amazon's reasonable price & you have a sure winner! All baby boomers should own at least a pair!
4,Great design,"Clic builds a very useful line of readers. The glasses offer some level of adjustability. That being said, make sure that you order the 6"" model if you haven an above average head size. If you have a very large head, this product is probably not for you. Using an undersized model will put the big squeeze on your temples. Also, don't plan to lay down with these glasses on. The rigid back pushing against a pillow will force the glasses away from their normal position."
4,Almost Perfect,"Like other comments, I wish there were more fashionable choices but I chose the clear that coordinate with most everything. Very clever design and so grateful to have reading glasses in strength options that hang around my neck but don't dangle into (or get caught on) everything when I lean over. The hard plastic sitting at the back of my neck tends to be annoying and make me hot...hoping that's only because these are warm months. Looking in a rear-view mirror, they look quite ""industrial"" from the back...if I were a man, I probably wouldn't mind as much. I still use my other glasses on a chain occasionally for a ""dressier"" look. More designers welcome to solve this problem many of us share!!"
4,Nearly Indestructible,"I had my first pair of CliCs longer than any other reading glasses. The combination of them always hanging around my neck and being ALMOST indestructible is a good one. I finally demolished my original pair by stepping on them when getting our of bed! The only real drawback to these glasses is that you need both hands available to put them on, so put down that coffee, or bag you're holding, or whatever it is if you need to read something!"
5,seesagain,"I bought clics 5 years ago from a friend. I needed to go up to a 2.5 and was pleased to find them at Amazon. I bought a pair for my husband, too. He wishes he could get a commission for every pair we have recommended!! They stay on, so no scratches."
3,Broke to easily,"Although I have enjoyed my Clics,I was very disappointed when they broke at the frame around the lens. My 12 yr. old son patted me on the chest and they cracked. Not knowing they broke I then lost the left lens. So they are now useless."
5,Click readers,These are my 4th pair of Cliks over a 5 year period. They are durable and convenient. Just wish I had some stock in the company. I'm asked about them regularly! Amazon made the purchase easy.
1,don't bother,I was extremely disappointed. These glasses continually come apart. They are more of a pain to wear then looking for my reading glasses.
2,Needs redisign,"I saw these reading glases on CSI NY and desided to try them. I think the idea is great but there is not enough ajustablility in them They need more of a loop in back much to small around neck and head,if raise my head to look up they come unhooked. They are mad for fgolks with very small heads!!!"
3,Clic Adjustable Front Connect Reader,"A friend let me try her glasses and they were great! When I got mine, the temples were too tight so it's uncomfortable to wear them. Unfortunately I threw away the receipt so I'm stuck with glasses I can't wear."
2,Not for Guys With Big Heads,I am disappointed mostly with myself. I own a pair of CliC's sunglasses that I use for skiing and have always found them tight. Other reviews of these CliC reading glasses also mentioned that they appear designed for men with small heads. These were so tight on me (even when enlarged to their larges position)that they gave me headaches. Optical quality was fine but the sizing is an issue that I cannot get around. I would not recommend this product to anyone with a hat size larger than 7.5 (not THAT big a head). Peter
3,Too small for larger heads,"As is the case for others, these glasses are too small for me even when fully extended. My hat size is 7 5/8 which is on the large size. So I guess I'm SOL."
3,My CLIC Glasses,"I purchased my CLIC glasses after seeing a co-worker wearing a pair. The order was sent promptly. One of the lens had popped out so I had to figure out how to get the lens back in. Although it was fairly simple, an instruction paper would have been nice. My disappointment was on the size. I have a normal sized hear and these fit snugly. Even by extending the temple pieces as far as possible, the wrap around strap on the back of the head was tight on my neck. And they were snug on my face side-to-side. I'd like to see some information on the ordering page about sizing."
2,Logo Sucks,"This is the second pair we have purchased. The new pair has a CLIC logo printed on the lense of the glasses. The logo will not come off. We will not buy another pair. We used them for reading, not advertising for the company."
5,"So practical....... and fun, too!","My glasses are on and off so many times during the day that I've needed to put them on a cord. Now, that's a lot of flopping around but I got used to it.My new CliC glasses hang around my neck, too, but they stay put because there's no cord. When I'm not using them I just pull the glasses apart at my nose, drop them to my shoulder, and then the powerful magnets click to join the lenses again somewhere beneath my chin. I follow the same procedure when I need to wear them again. I'm no magician but I've seen onlookers gaze in disbelief as I appear to break and then mend them perfectly in a second or two. Nothing flimsy or floppy about these glasses!"
3,Chic Reader Glasses not designed for the large head,"The idea of the glasses is great and I was inspire but it easy use when I observed the coroner on CSI:NY using a pair. However, I wear a 7 1/4 hat and the glasses at maximum adjustment sat up against my eyes and not on the end of my nose where I wear my readers. I even attempted to adjust the rear band to no avail. If they make these in a larger size I would purchase them again as it is a good idea, at least for myself."
4,CliC Front-Connect Eyeglasses,They're terrific. My old glasses used to slip off the black string holders. These are always available.
2,dissapopinted,"These glasses seem like a good idea for people like me that need ""cheaters"" to read anything up close. I work on a flightline in Iraq and need glasses that I can put on quickly and these seemed like a great solution. It's a shame that they were made so cheap. I have an average size head and they barely fit me. With the extenders pulled all the way out they are a tight fit, if I move my head at all they come open, very frustrating. They are now sitting in my junk drawer."
5,Kitchen glasses only,I purchase them so I could use while preparing food and reading recipes . I never loose them while on my neck. Great idea.
2,did not fit,plastic frame holds glasses too close too head--- and is too small in width. Liked the idea of magnetic connection for the glasses.
5,Clic women's reading glasses with magnet nose connection,Love them. Bought another pair. I don't lose them since they stay around my neck. Can do without my prescription glasses.
3,clic reader,I found that it was to tight in the temples and I couldn't adjust it without messing up the firm magnet connection around the nose area.I won't use this that much now.
2,clic readers long black,"unfortunately they do not fit, even the long size is no wider then the regular, i e-mailed clic then said try sonomas. how about putting a width dimension in the description."
4,Stylish and Practical. . . tough with long hair,"I purchase these for my Mom and Mother in Law for Christmas. It was perfect for one, not for the other.My Mother in Law loved them. She is always losing her glasses and that is not a problem any more. She has a thin face and the glasses looked great on her face. She has short hair, so when she would drop the glasses down around her neck, and then move them up to use them again - it was not a problem.My Mom on the other hand has longer thick hair, and when she would drop them down while she was not using them, and then up again - her long hair would bubble up in the back. So she would have to completely take them off and put them back on again every time.However, she has a ""Jacqueline Onassis"" shape face, and they look wonderful on her as well.If I had to wear reading glasses - I would definitely own at least one pair!"
4,"Great idea, need a longer ""tether""","I have a very small, narrow face. I'm a very petite woman - so these work for me - but I also have long hair. So when you snap the front together and pull the glasses up over your nose, because the ""tether"" is so stiff - it fights with my hair. And the option to leave them on the outside of my long hair isn't an option. So these are a great idea, if the tether was a bit softer or more flexible and/or they adjusted much longer. It would be great for a man with a small head or face - as they don't really give you much lee-way. I opened them up to the largest adjustment possible so they fit me - but again - I am small. So this would not be something for a large woman or your average male.I do love the idea that they pull apart and then snap together - because when I left them open on my neck - and I was wearing a scarf, no one even knew they were there and they really can be convenient. So just some tweaking and these would be the dream reading glasses!"
4,Mrs.,"These readers opened a new world for me.......a real conversation piece. As previous reviews have stated, you don't lose your glasses. My glasses arrived in time to take with me on vacation. But I was disappointed with the pictures taken of me.....hair around and above my ears stuck out. Consequently, I have ceased using them until I have my hair trimmed again. Otherwise, I have very pleased with them."
1,want pliable strap around neck instead of hard surface,I was disappointed in the fact that the part that hangs around your neck was made from the same material as the glasses frame and would not conform to the neck and was very uncomfortable. Seems that a softer material would be more pleasing.
2,Click adjustable front Connect Reader,Look better than they are. They are way too small for my husband to wear and not nearly as comfortable to use or wear as I anticipated.
3,smaller than expected,"Cool idea, but not very usable for my husband. He is a large man (not fat, just large) and it is very hard for him to use as intended. Too small for his head, neck, face. Wish there would have been a size option. Otherwise nice product."
4,Good Product,I have used this product in an admittedly low end Canon printer but it has given me very good copy.
1,Canon PG-40 Black Ink Cartridge.,"The Purchase Was Easy And The Price Was Wright But When I Got My Ink Cartrige And Installed The Primter Sent A Message To The Computer The Ink Level Was Low.I Send An Email To Seller Telling In What Was Happening He Told Me What To Do And The Message Will Go Away I Did And It Did Not Go Away i tryed This Serverial Times And The Message Has Never Gone Away,I Also Bought Another Cartride At The Same Time With The Same Results. I Will Not Buy From This Seller Again Or Buy Any Products. Stay Clear Of Them Plus They Do Not Have Phone To Ask Question To Resolve These Problems Only Email."
3,Recycled cartridge: good - recycled; bad - poor print quality,"I bought a recycled cartridge for the sake of recycling - there was little or no cost saving over a new one, though it's supposedly filled with more ink and so will hopefully last longer. Unfortunately the print quality is not up to par: I'm getting a lot of bleeding and smearing, it's good enough for everyday printing like driving directions or rough drafts of the kid's essays, but when I want something of letter or resume quality I have to use a different printer. It does not register on the printer's ink level detection as the seller stated in product description."
3,Good output - ink too costly,"I have used Canon printers for years. I recommend them to people for their low per-page costs...Those that use THIS cartridge though, are an exception. This cartridge has an in-cartridge ink counter that tells me I'm out of ink way before I actually do run out of ink. Additionally, the counter cannot be reset, so there is no refill market on these forcing you to buy retail."
1,Not enough ink in PG-40 Canon Cartridges,"I bought an MP470 printer on 9/4/08. I put in a full black ink cartridge (PG-40)and made no more than 30-35 copies on regular paper. It shows that it needs to be replaced. I called Canon and was told that the average number of pages would be 355 for one PG-40 cartridge. I thought the cartridge might be defective but the tech support person tells me that it would show an ""error"" on the printer if that was the case.I will continue to use the cartridge until it totally runs out of ink but I am very unhappy with the number of pages I was able to print."
3,Why not recycled ink cartridges?,Canon has made it almost impossible to use recycled ink cartridges. They are not alone. There should be a more economical and environmentally friendly alternative available for purchasing ink - not just the limited options imposed by a monopoly held by the manufacturer. Just think if you buy a car and could then only buy gasoline from the car manufacturer!
2,Not a Great Value,Costs too much. Dries up too fast. But that simply puts this cartridge in the same league as all other inkject cartridges. I only use my Canon inkject occasionally when I need color. At least one of the 5 cartridges is ALWAYS dried out.
4,Never any issues,Never seems to be worth getting junk ink. Buy the real deal in this case. Not the cheapest but works great.
4,Good Ink at a Low Price,I purchased this ink for my canon printer which is a very old model. I was afraid it wouldn't match but it did. So I guess this ink would match a lot of cannon printers. Good quality ink. The only problem I had was that it started running low after about 30 pages (a month or two). My old ink lasted for months and months. Maybe it's just me. Overall I am happy with the purchase. It was cheap so that's good enough for me.
1,junk,"The cartridge never worked right. It skips lines and has blank spots through the print. Took it to cartridge world. They cleaned it, but with little improvement. It's unusable."
1,BEWARE!!! This must be a wrong price.,There is definately something wrong here. The price of 83.08 has got to be wrong. They also have a twin pack of the PG-40 for 34.98. This price is more than the printers it goes in.
1,"Won""t work","I don't know why, but when I installed this cartridge, the printer will not print ANYTHING. It goes through all the motions, makes all the right noises, etc. but the paper is always blank. I don't get it."
4,Good product,I have not used the product yet but it normally works with my printer and i hope this will be fine as others used to be.It is a great product and works marvulously with Canon printers.
3,Canon PG-40 Black Ink Cartridge,"This cartridge works ok , however, it does not register with my printers ink gage. My printer shows ""OUT OF INK"" all the time. Also, The picture on the web page shows a Canon box and cartridge, but the product I received is not a Canon but a replacement ."
3,Not much in this cartridge,"Crisp, clear basic black. These cartridges go quickly, and I am not a power user. Still Canon has configured the printer so that it does not readily accept refilled cartridges. Little choice in the matter."
3,Remanufactured cartridge.,This is NOT an original Canon ink cartridge despite the picture in the ad and the description. It is a remanufactured cartridge. I purchased it assuming it was Canon. It works in the printer but does not give an accurate reading of the ink level because it is an aftermarket cartridge. I was disappointed with the misleading ad.
1,Is this real Canon ink or fraud??,"I have had my ink for less than a week and printed two sheets with little text and no images. Today I have ""low black ink"". This is so frustrating!! Is this a refill and sold as a new cartridge?"
5,Necessary Evil,"I hate having to pay this much for these, however I trust the seller, and it fits my printer, so. . . great."
4,Canon PG-40 Black Ink Cartridge,"Product delivered in a timely manner, in good condition. Easy to install, but has to be replaced quite frequently. (I do a lot of printing.)"
3,overkill on shipping,"The product arrived just fine, but the box it arrived in was huge compared to the size of its contents, which I'm sure I paid for. Otherwise I got what I expected, albeit at more of a cost than driving to get it myself."
3,Very easy to read and covers many items.,"I enjoyed the book for its content. It had many sports collectibles that you may not think of. The major problem of the book is the published date of 1993.In the world of collectibles 5 years is an eternity. As the title of the book reads ""Malloy's Sports Collectibles Value Guide : Up-To-Date Prices for Noncard Sports Memorabilia"" The ""up to date"" portion is not even close. Probably one of the best books that cover this kind of memorabilia but does you no good if the information is out of date."
4,One of the few books to cover more horse racing than glasses,"I can't speak for the other sports covered by this book, but this is the only book I have ever found to cover more horse racing memorabilia than just Kentucky Derby and other glasses. This book covers glasses but also programs and pins for all three Triple Crown races and horse racing games. The prices listed still useful even though 10 year old now since horse racing memorabilia isn't a very volatile market, at least in the older items. Just add about 10% or so to the prices and you are pretty much up to date again. The listing of games is one of the best parts of the book as I have never found such a comprehensive list anywhere else.If you are a collector, pick up a copy for reference use. They are dirt cheap now as used books here on Amazon but you will find it quite valuable."
2,Wear A Sweater While Watching!,"Low budget, mostly poor acting, but the work involved in shooting this in that kind of terrain and weather is why I give it two stars and not just one. There seems to be some frames missing and the film copy used for this DVD is poor. But hey, it was less than four bucks!"
3,Nazis in the Snow,"Roger Corman presents this cheapie war film in a very fast way, only running a little over an hour. It is surprisingly entertaining. Every war film stereotype is here, except for the fact that these guys are on skiis the whole time. The plot follows an American recoinnaise team sent to map out the territory. When they stumble onto a bridge, they decide to blow it up to mess up the Nazis. It is not a particular great film but if one had an hour to kill and nothing better to watch than it might be worth it. Definitely not one of Corman's better films, but it works for what it is. Recommened for any war film buff or Roger Corman fan."
2,THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN OUT OF THE COLD,"A bit of poorly acted ""war drama"", weakly spiced with poorly rendered nonsensical ""dialogue"", If anything can convince you of the essential meaninglessness of war, this ought to work."
2,corman goes to war,"roger corman i think has directed every kind of film there is . this is his war movie(i don't know if he did anymore)and even though this is one bad print i got mine in a dollar bin and for that price it's not that bad. the fact he was able to put this war movie together on such a small budget. get it cheep but if you likewar movies or just like corman,this is your movie"
2,disappointed,I was disappointed in the interpretation of Johanna's feelings towards her brother in law. From the letters of Vincent Van Gogh as well as the memoirs of Johanna Van Gogh it was my impression that Johanna was a stronger and more supportive person than this tale leads us to believe.
3,Too many different versions of this album,"Warning: Under the Album title ""Super Hits Clint Black"" there are too many versions. They are completly different albums and/or they differ in the number of tracks. This makes everybody confuse the albums. I ordered the album, then I realized that I had ordered a wrong version, so I canceled the order and I reordered the right album, however and despite that, at the end I received a wrong album. (The seller compensated me.)"
5,awesome,"Being a huge Clint Black fan, I jumped at buying this album, and was not disappointed. Several of his big (and my favorite)hits are including on this gem, including ""Like the Rain"" and ""No Time to Kill."" If you like Clint Black, you will love this album. Though it only has ten hits on it, they are ten good hits. Super indeed!"
3,Not good for wide feet,"I really liked the mesh and comfort of the shoe, but the sole is set up in the shape of a foot, which was much more narrow than my actual foot. It caused my ankles and feet to roll out, which was not comfortable. Shame, because the rest of the shoe is spectacular!"
5,Sketcher's Mary Janes,"Have always love Sketchers for being comfortable. But the Mary Janes are not only comfortable, but cute!!! A dressy tennis shoe, what will they think of next!!"
4,Stylish and comfortable like a tennis shoe with flair!,"I love these shoes. I am not a tennis shoe person. I usually wear heels, boots, etc. But for those days at the ball park, amusement parks, shopping, etc and you need comfort I definately recommend these shoes. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I have had problems with the velcro strap coming undone on the shoe. Aside from that hassle, I would still recommend this product to anyone that desires comfort and fashion."
5,Skechers Women's Bikers-Blush Mary Jane,"Absolutely fantastic. I LOVE these shoes. I am a music teacher and spend everyday on my feet. We are not allowed to wear tennis shoes to school and I've worn these without anyone noticing that they are ""tennies!"" I have another pair in beige and have worn them for three months. They still look new after I clean them. They show no wear."
5,"Feels Like a Sneaker, Looks Like a Dress Shoe","These have got to be one of the best pair of dress shoes you could ever get for yourself. It feels like you're walking around in sneakers, but they obviously look more like a dress shoe. This is a highly recommended alternative to heeled shoes for all you sorta tomboy girls out there who are trying to be just a lil more girlish or those who just hate the heeled shoe in general anyway. Great shoe!"
4,Lovely,Very good story line and a novel not so easy to put down once you start reading it.This book shows that life changes are not always such a bad thing even though adjustments may not always be welcomed.I especially liked the unexpected outcome at the end of the novel.
4,For the fans only,"It's simple: If you're a fan, buy it. BUY IT NOW, buy it hard. If not, don't buy it. She's just wonderful and you'll listen to it over and over. A mix of jazz, pop, and musical theatre can't be beat with this amazing woman. She doesn't sing much nowadays, so this is all we got, people!"
4,"good, but...",Product was what we ordered but box was completely smashed when it arrived. Was a gift so we had to tape whole box back together in order to give it as a gift.
3,fixed my pool cues !!!,It worked great I have kids that drop sticks and the tip pops off .I used this kit and fixed them up .A very good product.
3,prerunner to series lost,"lost city of murir {atlantis }ocean dryed up now under usa ranch, hero old cowboy guitar singer could do a remake with bob dylan now , i'm sure he would do a neat soundtrack too"
1,terrible transfer to DVD,I agree with the first reviewer. I was looking forward to watching this serial but the transfer to DVD is so poor that I gave up after the 2nd chapter.
3,Gene Autry sings to defeat evil!,"I mistakenly purchased this DVD (PHANTOM EMPIRE: Part 2) thinking I'd get the entire serial, but all in all, this is a pretty fun viewing. Gene Autry falls into a subterranian city named Murania, and must fight to stay alive against the wicked queen that rules there. Very silly robots about in this story, with short-brimmed cowboy hats on top of their box-like features. A rebellion is being planned, as on the surface of the earth evil scientists plot to steal radium from the Radio Ranch. On top of all this, Radio Ranch is endangered by Gene Autry's inability to make it to perform on his radio show!Complete with horse chases, sword fights, and deadly technology, this is a fun serial to watch. The print isn't great, but it is watchable and costs little for the entire collection. A very rare entry into the science fiction/western genre and a lot of fun!"
4,"Not about ""Phantom Empire""",Be careful when reading reviews of the quality of a particular vendor's DVD production. Often a review citing serious quality deficiencies are placed with every vendor's release when it actually specifies a different production. This may or may not be pertinent to the production you are researching. I am happy that most reviewers are specific about the vendor's version they are reviewing. You have been warned.
3,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"The Phantom Empire was a light weight memory trip back to my youth. The journey was fun but also revelatory; it's amazing how memory can cloud reality. Stilted acting, repetitive childish dialogue, and funny non-special effects are all part of this campy romp. Just don't watch this serial with your wife or children; they will start questioning your sanity and seriously discuss your certain slide into dementia."
3,The Phantom Empire - (Timeless Media Group - 2011) Fully Restored?,"I believe there is some expectation that a film which has been ""Fully Restored"" to be just that, as close to perfect as can reasonably be expected. I've come to accept some flaws as the restoration process can be a painstaking task. It would take a labor of love to get films such as this one to the level which we all could appreciate. In the real world, there's a balance between quality of the restoration and the amount of money someone is willing to pay for the restoration. At some level there seems to be a compromise between both. This version is not nearly the best available copy, this one and all others will eventually be surpassed...the question is when? If you need a better version right now...I suggest going to the Serial Squadron website and purchasing theirs! I've had it prior to this one, theirs is not the purest rendition but beats this one hands down."
4,Is this one better than the one at www.geneautry.com?,"I just got this version in the mail today. I watched the first 2 chapters so far and, from what others are saying, am not too sure if this is the copy I shouldn't have bought. It says its the complete serial and others say that certain ones cut out the cliffhanger. Not being an ""expert"" the first 2 chapters seem to be properly done. So, for now this one gets 4 stars. The quality in the sound and transfer/remaster do seem a little off. But, so far, so good."
2,great serial lousy copy,"Yes, I too have fond memories of this serial,but this is a poor quality transfer, inferior even to vhs copies I have come across in the past. 'Nuff said."
5,A classic serial to definitely get,This is a classic serial set in the same style as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. Definitely get it.
2,Gene Autry,I tried to use my D V D player with my T V but it did not show a good picture. Then I tried my computer and it is o. k. but not as good as the t v would have been. Also could not fill in the product link .
2,Hermitage Hill Media DVD of The Phantom Empire,clearly the dvd was made on an Apple media editor (note the logo in the main menu).looks to be half heartily restored by a bunch of people.you would be better of buying the VCI version.
2,Top not Tip-Top,"The top is a lot smaller than the tops I had as a kid (a looooong time ago) and, as a result, is less stable and harder for a toddler to use.He's able to get it spinning but not able to keep it vertical when he let's go (I have the same problem)."
2,Toysmith Duck Top,Kept it but was very disappointed in the size. I really didn't look at the size or notice it in the ad but remembered how big they were when I was a child.
3,Old time tops are fun!,Kids like these tops but they are a little hard for them to spin. An adult may have to be available to get the tops spinning well. Otherwise they are a lot of fun.
5,Great top but smaller than they used to be,Basically what my header said great top but smaller than they used to be. Product did ship very fast though!
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED?,"The picture is misleading because it looks so much bigger. However, when I received it in the mail it was a little to small. I think that Amazon should write the description of the size a little better."
1,broke next day,"I had these toys as a child ( now 30) and I bought one a long time ago in target for my girls , loved it, had it for at least 2 years before they kind of broke it by throwing it on the floor even though I was able to pop the 2 pieces back together but now after doing it hundreds of times it really ready to be thrown away. So I bought this one since couldn't find it anywhere in stores. Hugh disappointment. The thing doesn't spin!. The handle is ""stuck"" can't press down on it to make it spin. It will go down but no spin, it's forcing it down. If you hold it upside down the the top stays up doesn't spin down like it should. Any ides what can be wrong with it? Something appears to be ""too tight or needs some oil? Don't know. If any of you have similar problem let me know and if any of you have any ideas on how to make it spin would really appreciate it. Thank you"
2,Where do you buy this stuff anyhow?,"I was disappointed in this book. Pick a recipe, any recipe - does anyone REALLY have the time to cook this stuff? I also got some interesting looks at the supermarket when I asked where I might find the ""Mace"" (as in teaspoon of Mace) or the ""Quinoa"" or the ""Saffron Threads"".I must admit, I lost weight on this diet. I had to, I spent all of my time looking for the ingredients and had no time to eat.Come on Doctor Ornish, how about a book for the rest of us?"
3,"Eat More, Weigh Less: Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Losing Weight Safely While Eating Abundantly",I'm familiar with Dr. Ornish's other books. This one did not come up to standard.Very disappointing.
5,Has wonderful new life choices.,Gives you a choice of how you can spend the the rest of your life! The book has very small print and is a little hard to read at times.
4,Dr. Dean Ornish is still the best.,"I find that Dr. Dean Ornish is the best. Simple, straightforward, down to earth. No need to look further."
3,Thought provoking,"Dean Ornish has some really interesting ideas about diet and exercise, some of which I agree with. Let me say that you CAN lose weight on this diet, and that most of the recipes are quite tasty, if somewhat time consuming to prepare. The problem is STAYING on a diet like this. Personally, I'm just too fond of cheese, beer,fish and avocados to ever convert to Ornish' regime. A healthy diet if you can manage it but ultimately too restrictive and impractical for the average working stiff."
3,"this is a cookbook, little more","If you want information backed up by solid facts, etc.. go to ""Fit for Life"" or ""Fast Food Nation"", etc. This is a wonderful cookbook, but I bought it thinking it was going to truly expand on the benefits and hazards of eating meat, diary, sugar, etc. This IS vegetarian, which is not made clear on the cover...It is very heart healthy, but alas, not a ""scientific"" type book..just a general overview and lots of vegan recipes."
3,Here you,"Here you are bidding for a Mobile Camera Phone, its in great condition and is only 3 months old, it even has the screen protectors still on it. Its locked to the 3 network and comes with a brand new charger. It has warrenty untill dont have the orginal receipt unfortunatly, but with Nokia you dont need this anyway, just take it to a Nokia service point and providing its under a year old they will repair it free of charge."
2,WHAT THE....?,"I received my copy of the Scarlet Pimpernel. I have always loved the movie and was excited to get it at such a good price. I read the reviews and they said not to worry about the Chinese writing on the back. However, when I ordered it, I failed to notice it was subtitled and you can not turn off the subtitling! Normally I could deal with that, but the subtitle DOES NOT GO WITH THE MOVIE! Who translated it? It is ridiculous! I really feel that should be stated on the selling page! But, if you want to laugh hysterically at all the serious parts, get this copy! Which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1! I just wish you could turn off the subtitling!"
5,##$@%%^& great,"I can't really say more than this is an album that annihilates everything out there...actually that's bull becuase there are many bands/artists, that are amazing, but I just bought this the other day after reading a review on s[..] allthingsheavy online store catalogue and figured that it was worth giving a try because I'm always looking for the obscure hidden gems and this was definitely one of those for me and it was only a few bucks on Amazon. I put this on the other day and cannot stop playing it, it just smokes and jams. I have listened to a lot of bands in my time and this one is worth it. These guys, The Awesome Machine, El Thule, Kyuss, centurians Ghost and 5ive are my current lineup of continual listening. Check out the Awesome Machine if you haven't already, they are intense and just steamroll over you."
5,Excellent,"I found this book an excellent source for practical tips on how to design xml documents. Get it if you have have a good grasp of the theory and have used xml on occasion but don't have the experience to make great design decisions right away. All of the advice you find in this book comes from experience. It confirmed some of my own, but more often, served as an eye-opener.This statement on the back cover sums it up: ""The problem here is not really a lack of information (there are many books and online resources on xml out there). The problem is a lack of reliable advice on how to use these technologies correctly and efficiently.""Get it."
4,Love it!,I love all the nice things in this organizer. I've never owned any other pregnancy organizer so I can't make a fair comparision but it works for what I need. I don't really use the journal because the entry spaces are too small but I use them to write down really important things like when I felt the baby first kick etc.
2,To much detail,This book is for the type A organization types. I found it to overwhelming to keep up with. Plus I feel that pregnancy is a natural process and not every single bump or symptom needs to be written down or worried over.
1,Received wrong item,"The seller, Quality Bargain Mall, sent ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" instead of the Organizer. The invoice lists the correct product, so this was just a simple error in the stockroom, I guess. Amazon will send me a return label, which is good, so I don't have to pay for the return. However, because the book came from one of Amazon's partners, Amazon is not able to arrange to replace the wrong book with the right one. So I guess I should reorder and hope it doesn't happen again? My daughter would like the book now, because it's a diary, and she'd like to record some things. Maybe it's worth a trip to Barnes and Noble."
3,Great if you have time.,"Its a good book if you have time to write things down, perfect for maybe 1st time moms. Not as much for me with my 4th baby coming."
4,Good Buy,Helpful journal to have to keep track of pregnancy. It has useful information and allows me to go back and remember my pregnancy.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS JOURNAL,"EXCELLENT AND A MUST HAVE FOR ALL MOMS TO BE. I carried this with me daily throughout my pregnancy. This has absolutely everything you need and more to navigate and document your pregnancy...journals, places for pictures/sonograms, a place to write down questions you want to ask your doc, a birth plan, doula interview sheet, etc. Literally everything. I plan to save this for my daughter when she get older."
2,A little too organizer for me.,"I wanted something a little more fun to record my pregnancy. My mom picked this up for me when I requested a journal. In looking over it I think there are too many lists and questions. I was looking more for something fun to write some thoughts down, put some pictures in. I think I won't use most of this book because I'm not really a list person. If you are more organized and enjoy making lists, than this book is good for you."
3,Ok...but too detailed,"I used the older verison for my first baby. You could fill in the date and week of pregnancy and it had a space to write your thoughts. This next version is designed for daily entries. Even for a first pregnancy, esp a second pregnancy, there isn't enough changing day to day that there is something new to write. I found ""The Belly Book"" to be easier to use. It is desinged week by week."
5,WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOUR EXPECTING,It was purchased for my daughter-in-law. They are expecting their first child. She loves the book. It is and will be very helpful thru the next 7 months. She loves looking at the size of the baby as it grows. I would recomend it for any new to be Mom. It's a great gift for anyone you know who is expecting.
3,Eh...not really worth it,"If you had a very detailed wedding organizer, this is for you. If you're like me and can jot a few notes down here and there and remember things, you don't need this."
4,Great for the organized,I love to be organized so I got this for when my husband and I get pregnant. One thing about the pregnancy journal section; I would make copies of the pages for the 1st few months because if you write in the book as it recommends and you don't get pregnant at first you will have wasted those pages and use a lot of white-out. :-)
1,Waste of $11.,I haven't even used this as the formatting is really really bad. The lay out is horrid. It's not a well set out journal by any means. I also have the what to expect book which I'm not a fan of at all. Boring. I also signed up for the what to expect website and was flooded with 'baby spam' from advertisers.
1,Waste of money,"There is nothing that this planner can do that your own regular planner/calendar can't do. If you never owned a planner/calendar, you will not use this, either."
3,A good organizer,"It's a good tool to have when pregnant; however, I was expecting it to be a little bigger. It's very uncomfortable to write in and there is not much room for writing each day. Other than that it has great info and is closely connected to the book."
2,"Not my favorite of the ""what to expect"" line.","This is not exactly what I expected when ordering. It is a small book with small folders inside of it. I hoped for something larger with more information inside and different categories. Overall, I was not pleased with my purchase and have not used it."
2,Beware the garlic-sausage and lentil stew.,"I suspect that these recipes were not tested or proof-read. On page 110, the recipe for lentil and garlic-sausage stew calls for two tablespoons of salt. I assumed that was a typo, but even with two teaspoons of salt, the dish was inedible. I can only assume that M. Valenti expects you to use the very same sausage he uses; he makes no allowances for variations.The recipes also call for an annoying number of exotic ingredents, and offers no suggestions for substitutions. Porcini mushrooms, penette pasta, imported Italian tuna, arborio rice, smoked duck. This exotica might make the restaurant dishes spectacular, but for the home cook, they serve only to render the recipes expensive and unforgiving."
5,A Hot Time in the Old Town...,"After pulling on layers of sweaters and scarves, and trying to find a way to be optimistic about the falling temperatures, I remembered ""Soups, Stews and One-Pot"" meals. Hooray for Valenti and Friedman! (Personally I have enjoyed ALL of Friedman's books.) Just even thinking about the recipes warms me up.Barbara Tinker"
4,Very nice set of recipes and instructions,"This book has a number of really great recipes and also does anice job of providing variations. For example, if the recipe calls for lamb, he provides variations for sausage, etc. only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that many of the recipes call for some ingredients or spices that I either didn't have or was unfamiliar with, however, he is pretty consistent in using these ingrediants in many recipes, so it does not feel at all like you are buying them for a single meal. For example I don't typically use marjoram spice in everyday cooking, but don't mind buying and trying it if the are multiple ways/recipes to use it in.Only negative. I decided I wanted a new braising pot so this gave me a perfect excuse to buy one. &#128512;"
2,good recipes,"Although I somewhat enjoy the recipes, there are NO pictures/ I really find it helpful to know how the dish is going to look"
2,not as good as the real deal,Rothco makes soem good gear but the real deal is a lot better. but not a bad light weight fleece.
3,Definitive?,"I've recently read both Rush: Chemistry: The Definitive Biography by Jon Collins and Contents Under Pressure by Martin Popoff. Neither of these volumes is really definitive. Together, the two books come close to making up one truly comprehensive overview of the career of Rush. Chemistry lacks any input from the actual band members. Meanwhile, Contents lacks any biographical information, but focuses on the band members' recollections of each album and tour. Also, Collins' obsessive use of the phrase ""not least"" continually annoyed me throughout reading his book. I have to at least give Collins credit for attempting this project in the first place. Rush is my favorite band, so I enjoy reading any book I can find about them."
3,Rush Chemistry,"I thought this book was very informative and very in depth about the band. A little too technical in spots, especially for non-musicians. My biggest complaint about this book is it seems that the finished product was hurried along in the printing process or maybe it was budget constraints, I don't know. Pictures look like they're cut from a newspaper, many hard to distinguish who or what they are. Not a color shot to be had. I'm a big boy and don't need a picture book but if you're going to have cool shots like a teenage Neil posing with Peter Criss in full makeup...Hard to read the small ""blurbs"" in the gray boxes too. Once again though, I learned a lot about my favorite band."
4,Rush - Permanent Waves going on forever,"I love the rock group Rush. I have every CD/DVD produced. Some folks criticized this book because of the lack of interviews....but I can see all those on any DVD they produced. This was an outsider peering in, which gave new insights to the group that has survived for over 30 years. If you love Rush like I do then have some fun as you turn the pages and think..""Oh, that is why they wrote that song""."
2,Bad chemistry,"I realize that a band like Rush doesn't give many wild stories to write about (which is why I highly respect them), but this book is lame. I could probably fit everything I didn't already know about the group on one page. I am a long time fan so I know more than the average person but I hoped the book would be at least a little interesting. BTW, the author is very fond of the word ""least"", using it on about every page. Shopping for a book? Try Pratt's ""Roadshow""."
2,Why Was It Written? Because It's Written...,"Disappointing as to what I was expecting. The puzzling thing about this book, is that while it fairly well gushes about the band in the text; when it comes to capsule album reviews following description of the recording process for each album, this is where the criticism can become quite pointed. It's almost as if the author didn't want to offend the friends and co-workers of the band (it's obvious that Lee, Lifeson, & Peart didn't talk to Collins themselves), but then somewhat stuck the knife in when it came to reviewing the albums.I was expecting (& hoping) for a better overview of how the band and its members have evolved through the years. This is dealt with in only a superficial manner. The reader does not get a sense of the band and its times. Nor do we get a real feel for what Lee, Lifeson, and Peart are actually like as people.There is a definitive Rush biography to be written. Unfortunately, this is not it."
4,Slightly Out Of His Element,"Lovejoy is hired by Donna Vernon to find her wandering husband Sidney who is on a buying trip with Ken Chatto, another antiques dealer. Sidney leaves a well-marked trail and shows a surprising ignorance about antiques. The story ends in a marshy wilderness where Lovejoy is slightly out of his element. His element is actually antiques which he loves with an exclusive passion not easily understood by even his friends."
5,Hey Alphonse!,"Hi all of you!I have not got this Cd but I have the songs at home on other Cds, but I know that that is one of the best or the best smooth Cds in the world.If you hear that songs you are really a smooth person at this moment. If you want to have smooth songs that's the best Cd you can get!On this way I want to say so much thank to Alphonse for being such a nice person , for your music for all those e-mails and for the Cds . I am so happy that ypu are on the planet earth,thanks so much I cannot say it much enough. I think it's not possible to have a nicer , greater Hereo if I have with you, Thanks a billion! Peace, your e-mail mate, Niki"
5,This is the greatest love songs that I've ever heard!,"Alphonse Mouzon's ""ABSOLUTE GREATEST LOVE SONGS"" CD is the best compilation of smooth jazz love songs that I've ever heard. You can't go wrong with jazz legend/composer/multi-instrumentalist Alphonse Mouzon, along with other superstars: pianist Herbie Hancock; guitarists Lee Ritenour, Russ Freeman & Paul Jackson, Jr.; saxophonists George Howard, Gerald Albright, Richard Elliot, Ernie Watts, Eric Marienthal, Nelson Rangell, Paul Taylor, Kirk Whalum, Everette Harp, Brandon Fields & Gary Meek; bassists Tony Dumas & Welton Gite; trumpeter Sal Marquez; soul singer Philip Ingram and many more!"
2,not so great,"Hi. I recently ordered this from amazon. When it came however i was not impressed. In fact i was very disapointed. I had needed a good edc/utility knife and heard the DELICA 4 was a great option. WRONG! For starters the blade had so much play up and down when its open i can wiggle the knife and hear and see it move. Also the lock is located twards the middle of the handle and when i grip the knife it presses down. I personaly would not trust the knife under any moderate to hard cutting. I expected much more from spyderco. I bought the 3rd generation modle for 25 bucks brand new at a trapper show and it performs way better,almost perfect. For anyone who really needs a work knife try the kershaw blur or the benchmade pika2."
5,Great Everyday Carry Knife,"I suspect you would be hard pressed to find a better everyday carry knife than the Spyderco Delica. The knife is an excellent size and utilizes rugged high quality components. It is small enough to fit easily into a pocket and the clip works well. I have several knives that I like to rotate, but none has the size to ruggedness ratio of the Delica. The blade is Japanese steel called VG10 and the knife is made in Seki City Japan. However, do not confuse the Japanese origins to be indicative of a cheap product remember these are the same people who make Samurai swords. The blade length is less than three inches which is a magic number for legal carry in a lot of municipalities. If you need a great EDC knife this may be for you."
4,So far great knife but clip is crap,"I have had this knife for a few months now and it has been the best knife I have owned. It is still very sharp and zero imperfections. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the clip is cheaply painted and loosens the more you put use it. You can take it off and bend it back but I have a older kershaw knife that the clip never loosened. In my opinion the knife is great but the clip sucks. They should really fix this issue because you could lose your expensive knife once the clip loosens and it falls out of your pocket. It is an integral part of the knife for me. Overall the knife is great besides the clip, which is workable but should be improved period."
5,Very good Knife,"I bought this knife for a friend as a birthday gift. He loves it. He as done just about a little of everything with it, from stripping computer wires, to cutting boxes, to even using it as a screwdriver :/. He said the blade has held a very good edge."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME...,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has terrible actors, a ridiculous story, and is badly written. Whoever wrote this movie definitely didn't graduate from high school. Don't even waste a precious second of your life on this one."
5,Historical,"Excellent and well researched. Gives great understanding to the mindset and conflicts of those who opposed and endorsed slavery. I was able to use several quotes from the book in a lecture to a mixed audience on why we have problems in our society today as well as giving heart changing solutions for tommorrow.I first read portions of this book as a requirement for a History class at Virginia Tech. I had lost it or loaned it out a few years ago. When my lecture opportunity came I remembered it , found it on Amazon at a reasonable price and purchased it. This is a very well written and thoroughly researched account of the subject. I heartily endorse its purchase."
5,A fresh approach to easy Thai food,Bali Spice is an Asian women's co-operative trying to save the world one meal at a time. Some kits have both a sauce a noodles and the simple premise is that you soften the noodles with hot water while you stir fry a half pound of meat or fish and then an equal amount of your favorite vegetables and add a sauce packet. Bali Spice sells packets of noodles for those who wish to create their own spices and this kit of spices for cooks who wish to choose their own noodles. The result is a fine meal which can be put on the table in less than five minutes. Try it!
4,Half the movies are decent,"If you like cheesy 70's and 80's soft core skinamax type comedy's, the quality of the prints and transfers isn't great, 4 films in the set(BIKINI MED SCHOOL, BIKINI HOUSE CALLS, ILLEGAL AFFAIRS, BRIEF AFFAIRS) are a total waist and are basically the same early 90's vhs nonmovie reedited, but I enjoyed the rest of the films,SECRETS OF SWEET SIXTEEN is in the vein of the Schoolgirl Report films, SENIORS, GETTING WASTED,and INCOMING FRESHMEN are in the Porky's vein, but of course not as good. TOGA PARTY is a bizarre little low budget flick about a country boy becoming a rock star. THE HARRAD EXPERIMENT centers around a 70's college level sex psych class. The set has a good deal of softcore skin, and a few cheap chuckles. Not a bad set for the price, if your into these kind of flicks, and I am, but they really should have replaced the first four svhs nonfilms I mentioned with actual movies."
3,"So many bad, cheap films!","I bought this monstrosity only for one film, ""Toga Party,"" which is a really bad, poorly produced film that has nothing to do with toga parties. It is a very funny little film, and the musical scenes are hilarious. I do seem to recall watching the original VHS release years ago, and there being a brief Toga scene at the beginning. Please, let's restore this film to the directors original vision! Criterion, I'm looking at you!"
2,Better in concept than in fact,"I really liked the idea of a crumb catching box. Homemade bread is messy! Unfortunately, we ended up giving our box to a thrift store just a couple of weeks after we received it. It took up too much counter space and it wasn't practical to put it away and get it out again between uses--the crumbs would fall out.The other problem is that when we cut our bread some of the crumbs would fall into the slots provided but plenty of crumbs would also spray onto the counter. Thus we still had to clean the countertop. For our needs, a large cutting board that we can put away between uses works better."
3,A short review,"This is a good, clean murder mystery with economics lessons thrown in. The setting is very nice in the universities of Cambridge, England. The characters are developed well, and there are not too many to keep track of. A surprise ending. Worth reading."
5,Love this book,"As I said in my title, I love this book. It lays out the problem of how to approach statistics in a digestible, understandable, and rather complete way. The book actually follows my biostatistics class very nicely even though the class is using a different and more difficult text.I wish I was in class with the writer of this book. He is really a great teacher.This is now one of my favorite books, and I carry it with me all the time."
3,Not very helpful,"Did not answer my basic questions about the medical statistics. But the price is good, which is a positive. Will need more back up from other references."
1,Buy a 23 year old book????,This is classic Quinn--fountain os misinformation with a 23 year old book.Not worth a penny.
1,Why is this book still around?,"This is just a 23 year old version of Make the Most of Your Money.You can definitely skip this one, unless you like antiques without value."
3,"Not Busiek's best, but not bad","This collection of nine mostly separate stories is considerably above the average, much better in my opinion than the earlier Astro City stuff I've read. ""Knock Wood"" and ""Justice Systems"" is the only two-parter, about a criminal defense lawyer who finds a new way to defend his obviously guilty mob client and finds himself in a bad place for doing his job; it's easily the best story here, with the attorney's musings (in 1974) about losing faith in society and the government, and in the legal system generally. ""After the Fire"" is a short one without even any superheroes in it, about real heroism; it's actually a very affecting short story with pictures. ""Shiny Armor,"" which won an award, is about a superhero trying to learn to become human, and it's pretty good, too. The other stories aren't up to that level, but none of them are badly done."
5,"""Finding My Place According to Meredith Gould""","From the tzedakah of Judaism to St. Benedict to Buddhism's dana and Hinduism's seva, Meredith Gould highlights the significance of good works in all spiritual/religious traditions.This is a very nifty--and practical--book! She holds our hands as she guides us along the journey of doing good--the upside and what she calls the ""shadow side of service."" She teaches us when and how to say yes or no, how to manage volunteer assigments, and even <gasp> how to recognize burnout and what to do about it.She writes with great and gentle humor, warning newcomers to community work of booby traps they may trip over while on the path to kindness and self-fulfillment.This is a tips book for people who seek to aid their communities in any way they can and for people, already active volunteers, who wish to probe further into what they and their organizations can accomplish.What a treasure."
2,A terrible mistake,"The book appears to deviate from the uses of the Radha Soami tradition of books, most of which contain the path to enlightenment. Maybe if the book was an entertaining read, I might have taken it seriously, but overall, getting into the book was almost as hard as not falling asleep while trying to read it. However, it's originality may not impress the followers of the Radha Soami path, but those who wish for an unbiased view towards the background happenings should not miss this, just because of the rarity of this type of book"
5,Awesome,"I had this guy as a Professor at UCLA and needless to say, he is a living legend. This album is a keeper."
1,"Jason Lee, what are you doing in this piece of crap?","A friend recommended this movie to me, but I can't say the same. The online reviews kind of make it out to be a black comedy like 'Fargo' (did these people even see that movie??). But it's really just a poorly written/directed rip-off of 'Weekend At Bernies'. Turned it off after a half-hour."
1,I only liked the SUPER HOT GIRLS!,"The story isn't very interesting and just about the worse movie I have ever seen. I like Jason Lee from other shows and movies, but this one he was just average. I don't like Crispin Glover character and I think he was weird. All I liked about this movie were the HOT girls. But even that didn't save this movie from a 1 star review."
5,Great product,"I travel with my dog often. It is easy to install, I can still use my console easily, and it looks nice. I have been in an accident with my dog in it and she was fine. It does have a buckle that you can attach to you dog to keep them in it if your dog doesn't like to stay put. She love it, hops in and lays down and is good to go. I didn't have her strapped in during the accident but just her laying down in it she was fine, it was deep enough for her whole body to lye in it level and her head pop out to look around and that alone kept her perfectly in place. Great product and super safe."
2,Pretty much worthless,"We have a small toy poodle puppy. She is currently 4.5 pounds, and will eventually be 6-7 pounds as an adult. I travel a lot in the car so I want her to be comfortable on those rides, and not sitting in my lap. I thought this would be a good alternative, but it was not. Even at her current weight, she did not fit in the seat. Also, I was concerned that it would not fit in my car - but it did. I have a 2012 Nissan Rogue, if that helps anyone. The space between the seats in the Rouge apparently is much narrower than most vehicles, I discovered, while trying to take measurements and see if this would fit. It was tight, and it was wedged in firmly to the space. Doesn't really matter, however, as I will be sending it back."
3,Check your console before buying,"I originally bought this for my puppy to ride with me in the car. The problem is it doesn't work with my console. My Console butterflies out and I couldn't attach it to my console. It also sits high and doesn't provide shade. My puppy avoids the sun. If your puppy/dog likes the sun and you have a standard console, then this might be the product for you."
2,Console Dog Car Seat,I did not like the materials it was made and it did not like it sitting on my vehicle console.
1,To Small,Item to small for 10 pound dog. Not sturdy would never drive withour feeling my pet was safe. end end
3,It Works,"This is good for what it is. Its a bit smaller than I thought it would be. I should have done more research. Its made nicely and the pup seems to like it ok.I think it will work for short trips. If you have a very small dog it will work just fine, any dog over five pounds will be uncomfortable, my opinion only.I will buy a larger one next timeThank YouBob and Char"
2,Clasp does not hold,"I purchased one of these doggie console seats three years ago and it finally just wore out. Since the first one was so good, I purchased another only to get it set up and find out the hard way (hit the brakes and pup went flying into back seat) that the clasp holding the seat in place did not function properly. As with everything one purchases, quality control is severly lacking. The only way I would purchase another would be to physically inspect it prior to buying. If you do purchase one of these console seats, do your furry friend a favor and make sure the clasp holds before you go for a ride."
3,"Smart idea, may not work with some vehicles","Bought this for our 7 lb Chihuahua and when it arrived I was surprised to see that it doesn't have a flat base, there is a lip in the bottom of the foam near the back, which I believe is meant to keep the seat from sliding forward during quick stops. The problem is we have an 03 Explorer and the heater vents to the back seat are located along the top edge of the console. This lip covers the vents. I closed the vents, but the foam still gets very hot, and I just noticed that a small part of the foam had melted onto my console. This was easy to scratch off with a fingernail, but I'm going to take this off and try to augment it before reinstalling. The dog enjoys it, and when he's not with us it's easy to unstrap the front strap and let it slide to the backseat floor. Would recommend, but it may interfere with anything located on the upper back of the console."
5,My shih- poo loves her new car seat,"Very sturdy, our 10 lb. Shih- poo loves her seat with a view. Our 24 lb. Westie also loves it but he is a bit too big to fit comfortably. I would estimate that a dog up to 18 lbs might do well in this pet car seat. It is rated for 12 lbs which it certainly handles. This fits very well in our new Jeep Rubicon on the console."
3,to small,"I bought this small car seat for my dog. She is 7 pounds so I thought she would fit in a small. I also have a small Snoozer car seat that I put in my passenger seat, but my husband has a Toyota Tacoma that we take. His truck has a console in the middle of the front seats so we needed a console car seat too. This Snoozer is very small and my dog wont even get in it. I guess they don't have mediums for the console. I am going to send this one back and get a large. I hope it works better. I think this car seat is for dogs that only will reach 4 to 5 pounds at the most. I do love the Snoozer car seats though."
3,Does what it says it does :),"This product came in perfect condition, and in a timely manner which i loved! However it is very confusing trying to strap it onto the console...I basically gave up trying to strap it in and it seems to be squished between the two seats well enough that it doesnt move too much. Otherwise it does what it says it does and my dog seems to like it (after she finally figures out that she is connected to it and stops trying to jump around the car with it strapped to her collar...)"
3,does the job,"I like this product for what it does, but it is very hard to install. They make it seem very simple but getting the straps tight enough to actually securely hold it in place, is next to impossible. It barely git on my console. I get a lot of weird looks when friends get into my car. At first my dog loved it and would fall asleep, as shes getting older she likes it a little less. At a little over 4 lbs she fills it up perfectly, wont fit much bigger than that. [she is a 4 month old pomeranian puppy]"
3,Nice bed but way too big for my car...,"Unfortunately, my little dog is between 6 and 7 lbs. so based on reviews of the small Snoozer Console Car Seat, I chose to try the large seat. I have a RAV4 SUV and this size is way too big. I'm going to return it and order the small and cross my fingers she fits comfortable in it. I think it is well made and very comfortable for the dog. Based on the stated dimensions, the small should just barely fit. Will update if it works!"
4,Very nice!,My dog loves this carseat. The only drawback I found was that it is very difficult to get it strapped down securely so that it does not slide back and forth on the console. A skidproof fabric on the bottom would make this a great item.
3,Doesn't fit just right,I have a Toyota Tacoma and this does not fit on the center console without squishing it in between the seats.
4,Great product on small side,I put this on a Camry console and it was too wide so I struggled and made it fit. Other than that great product but only suitable for very small dogs or puppies less than 10 lbs.
5,Great product,Lilly loves her booster seat. We go to football games and travel every weekend. We travel to my son's games and it averages 6 to 7 hours one way. Lilly stays in her booster the whole time except for potty breaks.
4,Easy to use,"I installed two of these at my house (as I hate carrying keys), installation instructions leave a little to be desired, but I've installed deadbolts and other keyless entries in the past so wasn't that big a deal. If you have the right size opening in your door, you really should be able to install this in under 30 minutes, plenty less if you have any prior experience.Easy to set the codes, and easy to use."
2,Lasted 1year.,This lasted 1 year. Keypad broke and would not work so we used the physical Key. That lasted 1 more year until the key got stuck and while gently jiggling the key the entire lock cylinder pulled right out in pieces. It completely fell apart.Trash.
2,Not good quality product offered,"This air control since I installed submitted malfunction, not presenting the required quality levels, perhaps unrelated to the mark but with the level or condition of the product which has been offered as a novel, which has not been matched to performance from the start of installation."
2,moonfire,"This movie had ""Hokey"" acting ,poor script,& was touted as ""the most accurate depiction of trucking ever"" C""MON,GIVE ME A BREAK"" The ""best depiction of trucking was in ""BIG RIG"" ,the other DVD I recieved! I'm very disappointed in ths ""Moonfire"" DVD!! The first time I've been disappointed in ANY Amazon product to date!! Nuff said!! Mr. JohnsonMoonfire"
1,DO NOT BUY,This DVD contains 4 poor B class films. One at least is from a TV series that did not fly. I am sure anyone watching this DVD will understand why. How can stars get involved with this kind of film. [this site]has so many good DVD'd to spend your hard earned cash on. Give this one a skip.
4,Most enjoyable translation of Dante that I have read.,"I have read several previous translations of the Inferno since high school, all of which have ranged unintelligible to passable. Most of the translations I have read previously were so literal in translation that it was like reading Shakespearean English, this translation, while not perfect was so readable that I was amazed. The Palma translations attempts to maintain the original prose, but what sets him apart is his willingness to abandon the rhyming structure at certain points in order to maintain the flow of the story.Palma is the first translator that does justice to the Divine Comedy, if you are looking for a readable, enjoyable translation of Dante look no further."
1,After I Bought It I Felt Robbed,"One reviewer has suggested that original vinyl copies of this album go for 50 bucks, if anyone wants to buy my copy for 50 bucks, e-mail me, I'm ready to sell. Phyle Klurk convinced me to buy this album for a dime. I've never forgiven him for that."
1,only works intermittently because of loose connections,"There are at least three point where the adapetr is constantly coming unplugged from itself. It comes loose where the cord from the wall power meets the adapter, where the cord going to the computer or whatever comes out of the adapter, and where the cord going to the product to be charged meets the little conversion plug. If it comes loose at any of the last two areas, the adapter SHUTS DOWN, and you have to unplug it from the wall and plug it in again. Just fixing the loose connection doesnt work.junk.there are much better adapters out there for the same money, go buy one."
4,Works great,This adapter works great on my Toshiba tablet pc. It came with the appropriate connector to connect to my computer.
4,Good but imperfect,"Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this item. It is well-packaged, Targus have a section on their website that let you check if the tips will work for your equipment, and the supplied tips included ones that were correct for ours. The cords and connectors leave little doubt how to get the thing working. Except, it took me a minute to be sure there was an Empower connector (for some airplanes), but once I hunted I found it under the cigarette lighter connector. It all comes with a carrying bag.Two oddities. One is that the power supply unit has a very bright blue light shining when it is working. I don't mind this. The other is that, after unhooking the tip from my equipment, the power supply shuts off and I can't work out how to turn it back on again. It does come on if I unplug it from the wall and then replug it. Still, right now that aspect feels more like a bug than a feature, and cost this unit a star."
1,monstercrap,"18 billion times the weight, 1 billionth the gauge of my still functioning oem. same principle behind monster cable: so unnecessarily thick and heavy it'll pull itself -- and your connections -- apart by its own mass. Automatically shuts off power to the brick when it feels the urge. If we really lived in a free-market economy, the designer and the entire Targus family would be publicly stoned to death.But this is a really great price..."
3,WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT...,"IF TARGUS HAD BOTHERED TO MAKE A CONNECTOR TIP THAT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH MY LAPTOP. HAD TO BUY A TIP SEPARATE FROM THIS ITEM THROUGH TARGUS FOR $10 THAT LOOKED RIGHT, TO FIND OUT THAT THAT TIP DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE CONNECTORS REQUIRED TO SUPPLY 9OW TO MY LAPTOP. IT'S AN AWESOME PIECE OF HARDWARE. MAKE SURE IT'S FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE PURCHASE."
2,Happy I read the reveiws,Read all the reveiws on the Targus product. Just wanted to thank everyone. I dceided to stay away from this charger. Dont need the risk nor the headaches.
1,"Broke quickly, no service","I bought the Targus universal adapter for my notebook computer and it worked great. However, the cigarette plug portion stopped working a week later (which Targus acknowledged). Problem was, I had a business trip in 5 days and they would not send a new part out until 10-15 days after I returned the defective part! Because I needed this for my upcoming trip, I had to go out and buy a new adapter (not a Targus). Apparently the $2 part was too much for them to pay to keep a customer happy who had spent $80 for their product!"
1,Outdated product,This product is great for older laptops. But it has not changed the fittings since 2005. None of the universal fittings work with newer laptops. Would not recommend it until they change the fittings.
3,Dell power,"Dell seems to hate any third party adapters with their bigger laptops. This one does not charge a Vostro 1000, or M1210."
1,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM TARGUS,"This company does not stand by it's products - our power cord never worked properly - when I was speaking with their VP he would not give me his name, he said ""I forget"" - when I asked the name of the CEO he said ""I forget"" - they have had trouble with burn issues with their cords and are even doing a recall."
2,Targus AC/DC adapter,Product delivered was not what I had ordered.Product was returned and refund was issued.
1,Does not work on any of my 4 laptops! Don't Buy.,"Although the product comes with heads that fit my four laptops, it just doesn't work, on any of them. Sometimes the adapter block itself doesn't work, but when it does, the product still won't charge my computers.This product is a total peice of $%#!"
1,"Not a ""friendly' company - beware","Should you purchase their product and in the future and need a replacment part (something as simple as a cord) you better hope your computer is on their approved list of manufacturers. Fujitsu is not. If your device is not listed (the reason doesn't matter), they will very politely refuse to sell you replacement parts! And, don't expect to see a list of approved devices before the sell. Ater they have your money in their pocket, you are playing their game.I think there is something illegal here but don't have the time to deal with it. I will never give them future business! Tom"
1,Made the mistake and bought this thing twice.,I bought this adapter and my computer was supposed to work just fine with it.However after a day..maybe two...it just completely stopped working. The blue light was on (indicating power) but it would not charge my computer. I tried it with another laptop it was supposed to work with...same thing.Fast forward awhile later. I see this on sale at the store and decide to give it another try. I thought maybe the one I had before was just a defective one. Now this one works a tad better...however it only powers my computer for so long before it stops working. I have to turn off my computer and not even plug in the adapter for about 1/2 hour before it starts working again. Even then I have to leave the computer off so it can charge up.Don't make the same mistake twice like I did. Maybe this works for some people and I'm glad for them. However I've tried this one twice and both times it's failed on me.
1,Completely awful power supply,"This is an awful product and I don't recommend anyone buy it. First off, it wouldn't charge my battery, so I couldn't charge it up and take it anywhere. I was stuck using my laptop plugged in at all times. The worst part though was that the power supply was constantly turning itself off. Any time I would move the computer, even the tiniest bit, the light on the power pack would go off and I'd lose power. This happened every time I used the cord. Sometimes I would be lucky and the cord would work for a couple of hours, other times it would work for 2 seconds. The worst part was that once it turned itself off it would refuse to work for at least a few hours. This product is a piece of garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS POWER ADAPTER."
1,worst ever,"ive had it with this stupid adapter. it never charges my battery like its supposed to. it constantly begins charging the battery and stops after 5 seconds. ill be trying to get it to work for 10 minutes and finally get it to work, then at that point i have to make sure i dont move it or else it will stop charging again.in addition to that the tips dont snap on or anything, so the wire is often slipping out. then i have to repeat the process of trying to get it to work for 10 minutes. i cant wait to get a new adapter, i miss just being on my laptop without messing around with the power."
1,Don't do it!,"I've had the adapter 4 months, have been sent one new adapter and 2 new tips so far...I can't get my money back and am once again in need of a new tip. It's so cheap it snaps off if you sneeze. Targus, send it back to the design board!! And buyers, try Kensington."
2,Not durable,Worked well for my Dell Inspiron (2200 i think) laptop for about a year.Now it has failed and does nothing.
1,Terrible product,"This is a truly terrible product ... and is the last that I will buy from Targus:I bought the Targus 70W AC/Auto/Air adapter for my Toshiba laptop. Even without plugging the adapter into any device, it powers down just a few seconds after being plugged into the wall. When I can get it to stay powered up for more than 30s, and plug it into my laptop it will randomly cut out.Assuming that I had bought a device that delivers too little power, I then bought the 90W equivalent. Guess what? Same problem!I always thought highly of Targus but after seeing how awful these products are, I'll be steering clear of their future products."
3,Didn't last long. Poor customer service,"This adapter stopped working after around 7 months. Wrote to there customer service and they said they can't do much about it as it is not compatible with my laptop. The adapter packaging simply says the product is compatible with Dell, IBM etc etc but even after spending significant time on their site couldn't find out which exact model is it compatible with.Will think twice before considering to buy a Targus product again.After quite a bit of followup, they finally agreed for replacement. Got a new adaptor yesterday. Hence updating the rating from 1 to 3."
1,Connections became loose within a year,"Bought this about a year ago and the connections to the laptop and to all the parts are loose. The adapter has a feature that if you change the electronic device connected to the tip, then it can ""adapt"" to the new power requirements. However, since all the wire connections are loose, it just keeps switching off (to ""adapt"") -- to fix it, you need to unplug the wall socket and plug it back in.Very disappointed and do not recommend this product."
1,Save your money!!!!,"I have only owned one product(APD10US)from Targus and I will not buy another adapter product from them. I had this unit approximately 6 months and rarely used it when it quit working. At the time, my battery was shot (the reason I needed an Auto/Air adapter in the first place) and I lost my complete spreadsheet that I had been working on while flying back from Las Vegas. After this happened, I was so frustrated that I decided not to go through the hassle of getting a replacement. No more cheap adapters for me. After doing extensive research the second time around, I bought a LIND(3 year warranty)instead back in March of last year and it has worked just fine (with lots of usage). Mainly accessing the internet through WiFi hotspots using my wireless card on my notebook. Compare the warranties on each company before you buy. I hope this information will help you make the right decision the first time."
3,Great idea but...,"I was disappointed with the APM12US for 2 reasons. 1) Targus don't make a tip for for my cell phone or my mp3 player. 2) This thing is a lot bigger and heavier than my OEM laptop power adapter. I like the idea that you only have to carry one adapter for all of your electronics but the APM12US didn't really give me what I need. I now carry the Xpower pocket inverter 175, OEM adapter for my laptop, the usb cable for my mp3 player and oem charger for my phone instead. A lot more items to carry but it is a better solution IMO and much cheaper instead."
5,Another Cuban Legend,"Like the previous reviewers, I have to mention Portabales' voice and guitar.His voice reaches the soul and the precision and crispness of his playing absolutely brilliant.The tunes and songs are wonderful and this CD is a must for anyone who appreciates ""REAL"" Cuban music.Standard setting quality."
3,"Can be fun, but missing alot.","The game is missing alot, no contracts, no hall of fame, no create a player, no franchise. Graphics are really nice, gameplay is great. Commentary is pretty good, its all in all just a plain basketball game, play one season, then you have to start over. Next years will be better. NBA 2k2 has all the stuff, but not as nice of graphics. You decide, the best thing to do would be to rent it, and maybe save yourself some money for something else you might want more. I have one for sale, $40 if anyone is intersted, slightly used, excellent condition. Thank You for reading."
5,Forget the other review...,"It rare that i would even dare write this type of title for my review, and i do hope other are not piss at me. Anyway on to the game, other on here might say it not realistic, and doesn't have a lot of animation like other games. But who really care, this game has something that other games don't have, addicting gameplay. The most arcade basketball action since nba on nbc. Now if you like nba on nbc(who doesn't?), you will fall in love with Inside drive. Now you are wondering why i like this game so much well simply put i got this demo out of the xbox magazine and eversince i pop in the cd, i been playing this game everyday, and guess what the demo is only 5 minute long, and everytime i start a new game, i have to restart the game from the xbox menu. Now that how addicted this game is. If you don't believe me, then you have already miss out on a great games. Quite possibly the best basketball game ever!!!"
3,Great start for the X-Box with this game!,"This game is amazing! The dunks are excellent, the graphics are good, and this game is fun to play! This is the best basketball game yet. There is no create a player or street play, but that does not matter. The season mode is great! In most games, if you make a lineup in season mode, it will automatically change back, but not in this game. The only drawback is that blocking, stealing, and scoring is too easy. I blocked Shaq with Iveson and i got 85 points in a game with one character. Also, I got 96 steals with one player while everyone else had less than 15! This is a game you should rent unless you are a big fan of basketball."
3,basketball,I love this game. Best game ever. Better then all basketball games. Great graphics. Awesome dunks.You have not played a basketball games until you have played this.
3,Wish there was more to it.,"So, NBA is not as much fun as I would have hoped... This was the first basketball game I have played on any console. It would probably be better with 2 players, but there is WAY too much going on with 10 small people on that court and that tiny ball flying all around. Of course 2 different controller configurtions depending on if you are offense or defense takes a bit to get used to. Unless of course you make this your favorite game and learn the controller in and out it.It is sometimes hard to see where the ball is too... or know which player you are when things get going too fast. And it would have been cool to have some other game options besides just playing full games. Or even a practice option."
2,Nice try...,"Nice graphics, but nothing extraordinary. After initial minutes playing you can see why NBA Live 2002 and NBA2k2 would far exceeds in control and challenge. Extras, like fantasy draft, are a nice, but could have been better time spent on the game engine.Stick with the real sport games developers, like Sega, and get NBA2k2"
2,not the best,"this game is pretty bad , the controls are sluggish and the shots are bogus. the 2 stars go to the graphics which are pretty good. my advice wait for 2003"
1,Wait for 2k2,I dont know what i have to say but please just wait for 2K2. This game has preety bad graphics for an Xbox game and it does the same thing for each person after scoring baskeets! Wait for a BETTER bball game.
5,INSIDE DRIVE IS A SLAM DUNK,"I debated long and hard if I should buy this game since all the other baketball games i've played have ben so hard to play, but I bought it anyway. I'm so glad I bought it because this game is so exciting and so realistic. I'm having a hard time putting this title down simply put the players faces are super realistic, the commentary will keep you laughing, the moves are fantastic, the defense is easy to play , and the offense is explosive. If you are a fan or not of the nba you will love this game."
4,Awesome gameplay!,It is very AWESOME and very smooth gameplay the way u can control the player and it is very easy to adjustment with the varies of tricks of slam dunkin' and passing to other players. It provides the season and playoff and have special features behind the season such as coaching and others. It is conception similar to NFL Fever 2002. Worth to own it!
2,Goes On and On,Although it starts out fine the bulk of the book is simply a reprint of newspaper articles and trial transcripts mostly dealing with rumours and gossip not the crime itself. Boring.....
1,Villisca,"sorry, to say, but I did not enjoy this book . Lots of reprinted text, which became tiresome to read . I did not find this a riveting account. A polished author would do this story justice--someone who can string a story together in a comprehensible fashion. Plus, the number of typos in this book is deplorable. Misspellings, wrong words used,etc etc ! Either the publisher stinks at proofreading, or the author did not opt to pay for it in the package offered by this company. A big disappointment overall for me."
4,Well organized account of the crime and prosecutions,"This book gave a well-organized account of the complex sequence of events in the Villisca axe murder case. I've read many true crime books and have been disappointed by many of them that simply rehash the trial transcripts. That didn't happen with this book. The author obviously spent a great deal of time getting to know all of the characters involved and developed them in a way that made me feel as if I were reading a novel. Even though I felt he cleared the name of one of the major suspects, I didn't get the impression that he was unreasonably biased. Still, I would have loved for the author to give his opinion on who he thought might be the real killer.I would have given this book 5 stars, but gave it 4 only because it's in dire need of proof-reading. It had an enormous amount of typos in it."
4,great shoes,"Love this pair, it is very confortable to wear. The color is lighter than on this picture"
3,It was ok,"this was my 3rd book by dorothy Garlock, and I did enjoy it, but not as much as I enjoyed the other 3. Mostly cause I found the fighting between Katy and Garrick rather annoying half way thru the book, yes she tried not to like him but enough was enough. About 3/4 of the book over and thats when the action started with his half brother and everything, so 3/4 of the book was constant argueing and rather pointless writing.It is a good book dont get me wrong but its not the best, I enjoyed the listening sky much more then this one"
4,Short but Enjoyable audio cassette recording!,I liked this audio cassette recording of Dorothy Garlock's Nightrose even though it was abridged and very short I really enjoyed listening to this romance story of Katy Burns and Garrick Rowe but I just didn't find this to be a keeper!
2,"""I Love You"" Enough, Already","I ""love"" Ms Garlock's early historicals, but this one left me cold.I thought Garrick Rowe made a nuisance of himself with his insipid adoration of Katy Burns, and I found her rejection of him to be right on. I understand that he felt it was some sort of reincarnation between them, and I don't doubt that happens between people, but he was just a slobbering idiot. She wasn't much better in her defiance.There were a lot of stories going on in this book, and it seemed Ms Garlock could not find her footing on any one of them.That said, she is still a better author than most."
4,Story was good; seller sent in excellent condition,I'm a Dorothy Garlock-book fan.Seller was prompt and the book was in almost new condition.
4,Imaginative and detailed,"The action is fast paced, the story is compelling, and the characters are very real. The author has created a universe of challenges and adventure in which the characters are forced to grow. The only disappointment I had was when I finished the book. A must have for fans of science fiction."
4,Christmas 1995,"This is a partial repackaging of Sandi's Hallmark Christmas album from 1992 (It contains none of her material for the 1996 Hallmark album). It contains new material and the highlight is the closing ""Star of Bethlehem"" which is a rare song of beauty and majesty. The performance of ""My Favorite Things"" seems a little odd but on Sandi's 1996 Christmas TV special, her daughter Anna danced to the recording, and it all worked beautifully. The performances by the London Symphony Orchestra give Sandi the perfect backup for the mystery and joy of the holiday season. A vivid second Christmas album after 1983's ""The Gift Goes On."" We can pray for a third Christmas album.Yuletide Joy"
4,o holy night mp3,"Thought I was buying the whole album, love the songs purchased though. Sandi is one of the best singers of all times"
5,The Greatest Voice of the 20 Century!,"I bought this album when it was first released. Every time I listen to these glorious songs,, no other performer could bring these songs to life! She is truly the greatest voice of our lifetime. Amazing album, that will bring you years of great enjoyment!"
1,THE WRONG MOVE THIS IS NOT SHO KOSUGI'S PRAY FOR DEATH,This collection of four movies are horror movies they DO NOT CONTAIN SHO KOSUGI'S wonderful ninja movie of the same namePray for death (which was a superb ninja movie)Amazon should correct this wrong listing
2,For Kosugi fans only...,"I liked this movie back in the day, so I got this DVD. The quality of the DVD is questionable at best. Because it is ""Uncut"" the extra footage is in a different aspect ratio (4.3?) and changes while watching it. Other than that if you like Kosugi's movies you'll get this one as well..."
3,MGM On Demand DVD Release,"Unfortunately, the MGM On Demand DVD release is the cut version. The scenes of Sam Green's beating, Aiko's hospital attack, the restuarant shooting, and some violence shown in the finale, have been cut or trimmed down from the film, The cuts are identical to those that were made for the North American VHS release from USA Home Video.The movie is shown in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (anamorphic widescreen).While the picture quality is ok/good, it certainly looks a lot better than the pan and scan USA Home Video VHS release.The DVD only comes with English Dolby Digital 2.0 sound, and no subtitles.The MGM On Demand DVD release (MGM Limited Edition Collection label on DVD cover) is not to be confused with the unofficial bootleg DVD release that's been floating around for some time, claiming to be the uncut version, with different DVD cover art and an Uncut Version label on the DVD cover."
2,ALL FOR SHO KOSUGI,"This was my very 1st time watching this Sho Kosugi classic - I've seen the huge VHS box back in the day at the video rental stores but never got around to renting it. Anyway, the movie was a little low compared to Sho Kosugi's standard of ""Revenge of the Ninja"". It actually cut to a lower resolution during the ""deleted"" scene where his wife was murdered in the hospital, and that seemed really weird.Overall, it's a must if you're a Sho Kosugi fan. The actual fighting is pretty pathetic compared to today's standards, though. Oh well... It was the 80's, right?"
2,good analysis but yet one more thing to buy,"I purchased this with the hardback text that for a class in ocean law. Everyone recommended to get this book because it contains the 'analysis' of the cases from the more expensive book. If you are already forced to buy the big book don't waste your time on this one. I did read it, but much of the analysis was just a rehash in the big book and still light. I would not have purchased this if I knew this information before.Conversely, if you are looking into ocean law and not ""required"" to purchase the huge text pick this up because it's cheaper and will point to the same cases which are publicly available from the library.The authors basically needed to just include this material in the big text and not create a small separate book which did not have any different information."
3,PxMxWx,PxMxWx is not a popular artist but his music his good.This is not a must-have but it good.Buy this if you like the old Ca$h Money.Another cd by PxMxWx: High Life.
5,resident o visitante,"I love the video, it's refreshing to see young people finding their ways and searching for answers.Good on you Calle 13!!!los seguire apoyando porque ustedes no han elegido el camino mas facil."
2,Excesivo,"Estos muchachos no van a trascender en el tiempo con esa forma tan explicita. Por ahora les funciona, vermos cuanto más."
1,El cd esta asqueante,Sinceramente comenzando por la caratula que no me gusta en lo absoluto. El cd no se puede ni escuchar porque te lacera los oidos con tanto lenguaje obsceno. Sinceramente pienso que este cd lo deben censurar. Dudo mucho que este proximo año gane algun premio con este cd que es una basura. De corazon no le recomiendo a nadie que lo compre.
1,This is total drek,"I am not sure what was worse, the premise, Bertinelli's acting or the girl who played her daughter, she was just awful. Glad this junk is not available at all."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"John Constantine knows that he needs to build up Swamp Thing's metaphysical and magical might, to face the trials that are to come.He faces multiple antagonists here, including some vampires that have a quite clever way to keep out of the son, and a slightly odd werewolf."
1,Birth of a Nation rides again,"If you like stories of the reconstruction South where Confederates are noble and long-suffering, Yankees are stupid and larcenous, blacks are servile window dressing and women approach their men with the adoration of Harriet Meirs for George W. Bush, then you'll love this one. The only thing that separates the politics of this potboiler from ""Birth of a Nation"" is that Earle's is careful to paint the Klan as less than fully heroic, and to show some of the southern gentry joining in on the plunder."
3,Its Ok Its Just Typical Cashmoney.,"This Is A Ok CD. I Heard This At My Cousins House And I Liked It, Numbers 3 and 6 Are The Best The Ohters Dont Really Stand Out. If You Like Cashmoney I Recomend Getting This."
3,old school cash money,"This cd is pretty decent. It was made in 93 or 94 and sounds very good for being old. when I first got it i only liked 2 songs if you keep listening to this cd you should like it more. All the old cmr cd are like that.It has the old school cash money sound ,and i can hear some of the songs have samples in it. It sounds like an west cost cd from a little bit to me,because of songs like gangsta day.The best thing about the cd is that this cd doest foucus on bling bling like the do so much now.Man im glad i brought this cd long time ago, it cost a bit much now..."
2,Marginal Product,"Amplifier arived with a deep gouge in the enamel down to the metal on one side. The accompanying instructions are minimal and obscure. You have to provide your own cable to attach the DC adapter to the amplifier. After attaching the amplifier to the first of my two antennas reception was negatively affected. After attaching it to the second antenna the signal was amplified and stabilized by approximately 15%. This unit is just effective enough on the second attenna to keep me from going to the trouble of returning it. I would not purchase another one, nor would I recommend it."
1,Didn't work for OTA,"I don't have a cable. I paired this amplifier with DB4 antenna, but no gain in signal at all. It could be because I'm too far from the nearest stations (about 28 miles) and/or the airport within two miles. I think I'm just gonna get the cable. :("
3,TV Signal Amplifier,Amplifier works fine. However power supply rather odd. Need a separate (provide yourself) co-ax cable to get power from transformer to amplifier.
3,Works great but not perfect,"This little amp works really well, boosting signals to enable you to bring in marginal stations and really improving the stronger ones.However, it may be difficult to connect for someone who isn't used to setting up electronic equipment, and it may be confusing to those who are.The first big problem is the electrical connection. Power is supplied to the unit through a coaxial cable- which incidentally is NOT included. Then there is the puzzle of where to connect it, as the instructions leave a bit to be desired.I'm sure that some people will become quite frustrated trying to determine where everything goes, and if you hook it up backwards, you're not going to get anything at all."
4,Indoor antenna,"I have a flat indoor HD antenna that I had to move for each station group to get a clear picture. It is connected to a digital converter, which is connected to the flat screen (no digital tuner). This booster came with explicit instructions (from seller CableTVamps) that it may not improve signal on indoor antenna connected directly to a single TV. I almost repacked it for return, but thought I should hook it up, just to see. I gained three new stations and an overall increase in signal strength of 25%. Not bad, good enough to keep it. Channel 2 was unwatchable. Now it occasionally fades, but not for very long!"
4,signal booster,instructions were clear. Installation was easy as stated.The booster had little or no effect on TV reception when the rv is more than 50 miles from transmitter.
2,not worth the trouble,did not help signal get any better from antenna.so I bought a winegard ap-8700 and I get 4 more stations than before.
3,Good for Antenna/Cable creates isssues with Internet,I bought this product to boost the signal we were getting to our cable internet modem. It seemed to boost download speeds right away and worked great for about a month but then all of a sudden it interrupted our modem's connection to the internet and I had to remove it to get back on the internet. Hooked it up between an antenna and a TV and it definitely provided a much more solid signal in that respect. Either way this is a good product and it does seem to help out with internet bandwidth temporarily but don't count on it being a permanent fixture in that regard.
1,Waste of money,In my opinion this item is a waste of money. The improvement in the station quality was so slight that the $35.00 investment was not worth it.
4,works but don't expect miracle,"definitely increases signal, used it for over the air digital signal, got 3 solid channel signals that kept dropping.but did not pick up several weaker signals that are in my area, so it will definitely stabilize signals you already get that are sketchy but will not pick up ones that are below 5% range"
3,Worked okay for fixing broadcast (passthrough) digital audio dropouts.,"I was having a problem with Dolby Digital audio dropouts when trying to receive such programs on my digital tuner (and passing them through to my surround receiver), and it was pretty annoying.This didn't fix it perfectly, but I think it cut it down by about 80-90%. Good enough for the money."
1,If it works,"I purchased one of these units for my RV. It worked well for about 6 weeks, then it failed. I now have an expensive paper weight on my desk. The distributor will exchange the unit for the first 30 days then you have to deal with the parent company Channel Master. I called the company store in Mesa, AZ who told me to go back to the distributor. I explained that the distributor indicated that I had to deal with Channel Master directly. Channel master then gave me a number to call and leave a message. End of story. If it works you win, when it fails it's your problem."
4,works as expected,"This amplifier does exactly what the manufacturer says. I hooked it up to some RF test equipment and it had a solid +15.5 dB gain and the noise figure was 2.5. The instructions emphasized that this is a distribution amplifier and not to expect it to work as an antenna amplifier; that is, don't expect to receive more TV channels than what you get without the amplifier. In my case, I have several channels that drop out and breakup often. With the amplifier these channels now come in consistently without the drop outs. I did not start receiving any of the weaker channels that I was already missing."
1,DONT BUY . IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR,IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR. POOR QUALITY AND THEY DONT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEY TO PROCESS WARRANTY.
5,Works great!,"I just changed cable companies and the new signal coming in was choppy. 1/2 of the HD channels I was paying for cut in and out. I used Tivo's signal meter and those channels were getting no signal to a ""41"". After installing the PCT amplifier all of my channels consistently get ""90+""This seems to be a good product though I've only had it installed for a few day so I'll update if there are any changes"
1,Nope.,I set this up exactly as recommended in the instructions and on most channels there was no effect on signal strength and on a few weaker reception. It does make a great paper weight.
5,mike48,"all product information is clear and detailed and the price is competitive works very well, the signal is stable, fast shipping, thanks"
3,No difference in reception noticed,"I bought the PCT 1 port amp for my 18' camper. I wired everything and tied in as specified. I can't really see any difference between using the amp or removing it and just running a coupler in place of it. I can't say it is bad or good..... just might be my situation or some other factor. I was in the mountains of Virginia last month for a week when I tried it. Maybe it was just the location hindering the performance, but for the price it makes a relatively attractive paperweight too."
2,Not worth the cost,"Slight improvement in audio, better performance in video when your close to losing signal.Not worth the cost.Shipped in 1 day."
2,No Cigar,"Don't want to totally give it down the road, but purchased this with Winguard antenna attachment in hopes of getting a tv channel in a bad reception area. No Cigar! Only used in this one area, which is a bad reception area.Sorry, but wasted my money!"
1,Very Disppointed,"Something must be wrong and i don't know what.The four channel one i bought works great.I put this signal amp behind one T.V.being it is a single amp. I was worried about overload.Boy did i get a wrong number.It did nothing to improve the signal it made it worse.The signal is coming in from cable to a four way splitter and one of the T.V's is weak in four channels.I figured i hooked it up wrong.No,i had three people look at it.So i figured i had some bad cable,no i used three different 75 ohm pieces and no change.I mean how can i screw up a one output amp,and i am pretty sure its from the same company.I know it is.To make matters worse i bought two of them.Now i haven't tried the second one yet.Like i say something is wrong.I will call the company on Monday.Stay tuned.One more thing the price difference between this sellers is well, how does one sell it for Thirty five dollars less than the other.Stay tuned i hooked it up wrong.( according to seller)"
2,"Yes, I read the disclaimers, but...","I read the disclaimers, I read the instructions as to when it was helpful and how and where to place it. However, my signal was not boosted at all, and in some cases, it was degraded. It was not the case that there was NO signal present on certain channels, every channel I needed to boost had some signal. I saw no effect whatsoever with this product."
2,Too much amplification - unresponsive support,"The amp definitely boosted the cable signal, but it actually boosted it too much. Bought 15 dB amp that would take our current -12 dB line up to about +3. Instead it took it to +15 (too much as the ideal range is supposed to be plus or minus 5 (perfect is zero dB).Tried fixing it by putting it on a 3-way splitter - Even through the splitter, got almost 15 dB increase on EACH Line (again too much). Went directly to their support email address asking if they made sense to them & received no response. Then sent a message through the Amazon system (with same question) - again no response.Without any reply, have to assume it's a defective amp"
1,Non functional item,I install the amplifier and my HDTV only scan 3 HDTV channels.Without the amplifier I received 25 HDTV channels.The product was faulty.I email the seller and received no help.So I return the bad product.
4,digital ampligier,This product greatly improved the signal to a television located a good distance from where my antenna comes into the house.
2,Nothing New Here,"Taken from the premise that this book will likely just be picked up by fans who already know much of the Floyd story, I'm puzzled about what the author was trying to achieve. There's no real revelations here, nothing that hasn't been said or published before. In fact, looking at the sources he draws from, it's primarily a collection of previously published works and even a few DVD's! My - what strenuous research Mr. Harris must have done.Unless you're completely new to the material, this book will do very little to help further your knowledge of the subject. It appears the author just cobbled together a bunch of already known facts and anicdotes in an attempt to make a few bucks off a great creative work that has stood the test of time. Save your money."
3,worthy but reads like a thesis,"This is the story behind one of the great albums of all time and certainly one of my favourites.Harris takes us from the origins of the band and the influence of Syd Barrett through to the production of the classic album that was almost called Eclipse. It is worthy but does read a little like a thesis, about the influences that drove the eventual album and it's contents, but then also one could also argue that any band of that age were evolving and Dark Side was when it first all came together.It has some interesting moments and facts but is a little dry and clinical. Perhaps such a classic as DSOTM deserved a little better, but then it is quite hard to write a book on just one album I suppose."
2,BE CAREFUL,"This collection has two DVDs with 4 movies. However only one is worth watching...Shaolin vs Manchu. I would have given this movie 3 stars but the other crap that came with it renders the package a 2 star deal. I suggest you buy Shaolin vs Manchu for $4.99 unless of course you don't mind paying $5 extra for three ""kung-fu"" movies that are utter crap."
2,The Ultimate Immortal soap opera,I got this dvd today March 19th from a used cd and dvd store and this is going back March 20th. When I got it home I looked at the reviews for it and saw it was only rated 2 stars and found out the review was wright.The only good movie on here is shaolin vs. manchu the others aren't even worth buying or watching It was like watching soap operas from another country. The biggest thing about this is that the dvd cover basically misleads into thinking wow this must be action packed and It's not It's like watching kids play with plastic swords and throwing red paint on themselves when one of them wins. The first movie Hero's blood didn't have one hero throughout it I could of been the hero because nobody in the movie could fight. The picture was very poor It might as well have been on VHS you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.In a way giving this 2 stars is being nice but shaolin vs. manchu gets the 2nd star.
4,Easy on your back,I don't give it a 5 because it's not perfectly weighted and sometimes the balls get stuck inside and I have to kick it a little to get them moving again. Still every time after that you can get through the next 6-8 balls without having to do it. Also the arm can benefit from a little less counterweight and about a 5-10 degree more play on the way down but otherwise a great training tool..
2,Half-baked,"I lost track of how many times this low-budget indie used the same downtown LA scene-setter, with its view of the tallest building. It's a down-at-the-heels coming of age tale that focuses on a young girl who runs away because daddy abused her. She meets and falls for an illegal alien, and they live in an urban loft, of sorts, though how they pay for it, plus cell phones and food and beer, is left a bit hazy. The centerpiece is an attack by daddy who comes back to get his daughter, only to be driven off. There's no plot here, just a character study of homeless life in urban LA. It's forgettable, but okay as you watch it."
2,Good Quality but small,"It has a good quality, nice looking but too small, I expected to have more compartments to care the charger and extra battery. Over all good buy."
5,Panasonic PS SFZ30W Camera Case,This bag is great! It holds EVERYTHING (that originally comes with the camera) including the manual. On the front it DOES NOT SAY LUMIX it says PANASONIC. But its very compact but still holds everything you need plus little extra pockets for extra things.
2,Camera case,Nice case not much room for anything but the camera. I was disappointed in how small it is.
2,Give it to Lowe to design,"I've had a couple soft cases from Panasonic now and each time I wind up returning to my old Lowe soft case called ""Off Trail"" that I bought years ago for my Canon Elan. I have the FZ7 and it fits in the top-loading holster very nicely w/the lens adapter already attached and w/room for both my closeup lens and UV filter cases. I also had purchased the side pockets for this case way back when to hold film canisters while on photo-safari in Malawi and I use them now to hold the USB cable and the battery charger. The whole outfit straps around my waist and is immediately accessible. o Lowe!"
3,Australian SF Reader,"Those human types seem to think that having horses of a rare color is worth a fair bit of cash. They have been trying to catch the Silver brumby for a while, and now that he has offspring, they have another target.Lucky for him that he has a secret hideout in the bush a la Captain Starlight in Robbery Under Arms."
3,90 Minute commercial,It had some real information but also spent alot of my time showing me what they had to sell me. It distracted me from the real information.
4,I'm speechless,"This is great, if you like the kind of movies they make fun of on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Three of the films are in black & white and just take the cake for classic super cheezy horror. If you have high expectations or only appreciate high budget hollywood crap, this is not for you. Otherwise, check it out!"
2,Misleading marketing,"The 4 movies are from the 50s/60s, all black and white. The movies are good, average ""horror"" movies from the 50s/60s. The pace is slow, sometimes very slow, and there are a lot of dialogues. If you are into this kind of movies, this box set is a very good deal for the price.The picture that appears on the box set is not taken from the movies found in the box set. The completely misleading marketing deserves only 2 stars."
5,Great Book,Great info. A great handbook to keep on the end table. It maybe black and white. But it is the info on the plants that is inportant.
5,Kiowa Dictionary,"This is an older dictionary, from 1924, but is detailed and thorough. The book is 255 pages long and includes English-Kiowa, Kiowa-English, pronunciation and grammar guides, and a glossed Kiowa text. The only downside is that the orthography (spelling system) which is used is very unusual and unintuitive to either English speakers or people familiar with IPA phonetics (a capital H represents the flat A sound in ""cat,"" for example). This is not how the Kiowas write their own language, either, and it's hard to get used to. Still, there is a real wealth of information here and Kiowa language materials are not easy to come by. A Kiowa audio tape, like ISBN# 9994461796, might help make this book more useful to the general population."
3,Lexis - Branch Of Knowledge,"Lexis' debut album, BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE, starts off with the melodic drum `n' bass of ""Frantic"" and Photek's remix ""Groove Therapy,"" and it's almost enough to make assume you know what's coming. The mood grows darker with ""Illusion"" and takes a noir turn with ""Endurance"" and ""Visions."" A smooth funk vibe comes through on ""Mind Games."" But although all the tracks are well-crafted, none of them have a real vivid pop. Sure, ""Hypnotise"" sparkles with its sci-fi ethos and ""Criminal Elements"" is soundtrack-worth, but as for immediately memorable tracks, none quite fit the bill. Still, an enjoyable album."
3,Attention: Hammer Horror Fans,"This box set is notable for being the ONLY option in the world for viewing ""The Ghoul"" (aka ""Night Of The Ghoul"") on DVD. Yes the quality is not great - it looks like it was copied straight from an old VHS tape. But its not completely terrible. The movie itself is quite good if you enjoy Hammer style horror movies. It stars Hammer veterans Peter Cushing and Veronica Carlson and is written and directed by Hammer stalwarts Anthony Hinds and Freddie Francis. It is missing about 10 minutes from the uncut version but none of the cut scenes involve any missing gore. All the other movies in this box set have been released in much better restored editions ""HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB""-a Paul Naschy Spanish horror classic has received much better deluxe DVD treatment, ""ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS"" is really ""The Ghost Galleon"" which has also been released in a box set ""The Blind Dead Collection"" and ""ZOMBIE HELL HOUSE"" which is a crappy copy of Fulci's ""House By The Cemetery""."
5,Only a true horror fan would notice!,"The third movie in this collection (Zombi at Hell House) is a Lucio Fulci classic.....if purchased alone it would cost much more than all four of these together.""renamed"" (look it up.....The House By The Cemetery) With that included along with a Peter Cushing film, most of which impossible to find, who could complain? If you call yourself a true horror fan you should be ashamed for slighting Cushing or Fulci.One of the films is part of a four part series of films. Zombie Flesh Eaters is actually one of the Blind Dead films by director AMANDO DE OSSORIO called The Ghost Galleon. Watch Tombs Of The Blind Dead first in the series to have a greater appreciation of this film."
3,Lacking in Substance,"First issued in 2005, the ""newness"" of this book is its strong point -- i.e., hotel and restaurant recommendations are very current. However, the book is not a stand alone tour guide for Madeira. Its maps are totally inadequate in their level of detail, its coverage of things to do/see varies from excellent to sketchy. I would recommend it only as a companion guide to a more comprehensive tour book."
3,Not What You Think You Are Buying,"One of my favorite songs on this CD""Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel"" turns out to be a 1986 remake that does not sound like the original song that came out in 1977. It is an adulterated later version of the original song.The other songs on this CD are the otiginal 70s songs like ""It Only Takes a Minute"" and ""Whodunit"" which are great and make me give this an average rating,however I am strongly disappointed that ""Heaven Must be Missing an Angel"" on this CD is not the original version."
5,Track listing times,I love this CD! I bought this not knowing what the lengths of the songs were so I thought I would share that with everyone.01. It Only Takes A Minute (4:00)02. Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel (6:55)(1985 Irresistible Angel Mix)03. Slow Train To Paradise (4:59)04. Never Had A Love Like This Before (4:34)05. Check It Out (3:20)06. She's Gone (3:39)07. My Ship (3:27)08. Don't Take Away The Music (6:13)09. Whodunit (3:36)10. The Mighty Power Of Love (3:55)11. One Step Away (4:14)12. The Ghost Of Love (5:48)13. The Love I Never Had (3:28)14. I Wanna See You Soon (3:47)15. Bein' With You (3:44)16. More Than A Woman (3:15)
1,not the original recordings,"I don't know what they did, but this CD does not sound like the original recordings. So different, I threw it away. You may want to consider a direct download from some other source."
2,"tavares, greatest hits",I was a little disappointed with this CD because the songs don't sound like the originals that I was expecting. They sound like re-makes. How would you know this before purchasing other music? Did I miss something?
5,learnin,helloat first i must to say that i m very glad to find this placemy language is persion and know arabic and english language little but i want to study and learn most.english language learning is important than arabic for meif it possible i want to translate from english to arabic language .
4,Nice alternative to actually having TV,"I don't have TV, but I travel enough for work that I caught three episodes in a row of this show in hotel rooms. I had missed the pilot, but was hooked enough on the show to want to see it. A&E has some of the episodes online, but they have commercials, and there is the occasional lag. This video from Amazon was virtually lag-free (literally, once I had downloaded the full episode), but I noticed the colors were a little oversaturated for the middle of the video (to the point that the background looked almost cartoony in brighter scenes) but the people were still clearly visible. It's not perfect, but it's better than trying to stream videos with irritating malfunctioning ads, and it's still cheaper than having TV."
5,Great!,"At first I was skeptic about this show and after the 3rd or 2nd episode find myself attached to it. After watching this full season it turned out to finalize this season really great. Would of been interested how they continued Season 2. Don't want to give spoilers, but you won't regret watching this entire season. In fact you might find yourself wanting more, even thought season 1 ended with a nice touch."
5,This series was excellent. Patrick Swayze was older and sexier even.,"This series was well-written and different from all the other police/FBI procedurals. Patrick Swayze's character was very charismatic, the plots were clever and the co-star was a bit odd, but grew on you."
5,His Beast Was the Best!!,"Such a powerful story with no punches pulled. Patrick Swayze finishes his career on a high note. Actually filmed on location, he never let his illness get in the way of performing an outstanding role and creating a character who would do what he had to do. I think you may be cheering him on when he uses his unorthodox methods to take down the 'bad guys'. Think of the show, ""Leverage' on steroids."
5,The Beast,I really was saddened by the passing of Patrick Swayze and this was a awesome way for him to say goodbye. I;ll miss you and everytime I watch the series I'll be thinking of him.
3,Another fine CD from this very talented singer,"It's a shame that a jazz vocalist as talented as Carol Sloane isn't better known. She's been singing since the early 1960s, and has an incredibly warm, husky alto. This woman really has a way with a ballad. Sloane romps effortlessly through George and Ira Gershwin's ""Soon,"" and she captures every bit of the wondrous imagery of the Johnny Mercer-Lionel Hampton classic, ""Midnight Sun."" She is simply devastating in her delivery of ""Something Cool,"" a song associated with June Christy. This is a fine recording, and I strongly recommend her other CDs on the Concord label."
4,"Carol Sloane ""When I look...""","Purchased this album for the title song, ""When I look into your eyes"". Good rendition. Some other songs, especially when she tried to to ""bop"" her way weren't as workable. Overall, OK."
1,Hipster Wagner???,"I really wouldn't recommend this performance. It seems to make fun of the opera more than to perform it. The famous opening of Act 3 is set in a girls' dormitory and involves a pillow fight. The sets are spare and ugly, the singing is adequate but not good. It might be worth watching if what you want is an attempt at ironic commentary on the original, but for me it really just ruined a good opera."
1,High school play?,I do not even want to waste time on a review - all I can say - stay away form this attempt to make a high school version of this masterpiece. Distasteful! The reason for the ONE star is the Bluray quality. Do not sell your soul to the devil. Will not occupy space on my shelve nor belittle other great recordings with its presence. I naturally have NO opinion about this...
1,looks good but does not toast evenly,"I really liked the looks of this toaster. however, it really does not toast evenly. I ended up returning it.I thought a toaster toasts, whats the difference. Once you have toast that has been toasted evenly its much better. cant believe I am critiquing toast but I don't want someone else to waste their time and money on return shipping."
5,Works Great!,We have used ours for aprox. 3 mos. and have had no problems. Use it on a daily basis and are completly satisfied. This is our first four slice toaster and wish I had one sooner. Great Product.
4,Toasts evenly,"This toaster toasts well, bagels and bread. really long pieces of bread have to be cut in half to fit. Good value, hope it lasts. We seem to go thru toasters every year or two no matter what we pay for them."
4,Very entertaining and inspiring,"This movie was inspiring, funny and entertaining. I'm a pretty competitive endurance runner and I loved it. The group that drank beer to train was pretty funny, even though I can't relate to them. I would highly recommend this movie all athletes and non-athletes."
3,Fun documentary,For those who have ever run a 200 mile team relay race this movie / documentary is great fun.If you have never really experienced one then I think it will be one to avoid.Bought for a present but have seen the movie as I have a copy myself.
5,Great movie for any level Runner. VERY inspirational.,"Just got my Blu Ray in from Amazon. I'm an impatient soul, paid for overnight, but it was well worth it!! LOVED LOVED LOVED the movie!! So Jealous of all those runners having so much fun doing Hood to Coast!"
5,just like being there,i've ran the Texas Independance Relay this year. This movie brings back all the memories plus some. Makes me want to run the hood to coast in the future. Although i hopefully i will not do it less than a week after a 50K like i did with the TIR.
2,Needs More Racing and Less Human Interest Cliches,"This DVD doesn't have much about the actual race, so if you're looking for top teams, race strategies, team logistics and tactics, or nutrition schedules, you can forget it. This film is mostly about four very different teams, only one of which seems to be competitive. Of the other three teams, two are featured to tug at your heart strings, which is becoming such a cliche in the first place and was seriously overdone in this film. The final team is a bunch of Gen Xer's who are doing this more on a lark and less on real training. Buy this DVD if you like the human interest stuff. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,All bluster! Occasionally witty but often sloppy,"The only way to get away with being a smart aleck is to be really smart, and Mark Steyn comes across all too often as a big dummy. His casual name dropping is pretentious at best, and all too many of the quotes he claims to have heard firsthand were previously published elsewhere. As to his theories, he relies on data that is far too selective to support many of his ideas. In seeking to entertain or even titillate, he winds up sounding boorish. While I don't think much of RENT, I do not agree with much of what he says against it. His word games and puns are amusing, but they wear thin after the first few chapters -- my advice to him is to heeds the Bard: ""more matter with less art."" My advice to you is to spend your money elsewhere."
1,What a crock!,"What an incredibly disappointing book this turned out to be. Is Mark Steyn's brain completely ossified? Does he think that the only good musicals are those that are ""fun""? Get real, Mark, a lot has happened since Curley rode on into that cornfield. In case you haven't heard, the musical can actually comment melodically on the lives of real people AND be good entertainment. I heard that Steyn knew what he was talking about, but after partaking of this bowl of tripe, I will take the comments of the person who told me that with a very large grain of salt. The final straw, of course, is his viciously homophobic chapter called ""The Fags."" One would expect this from a company like Regnery, but not from Routledge. What is happening over there? And finally, a question for the father from Manhattan who whistles tunes from Oklahoma (a show I like by the way) on the way to school with his little boy: Are you for real???????"
2,"Sometimes Witty, Often Wrong","Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective. He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance. Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about. For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog. It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless. This book is not truly bad. It is just simply odd. If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy. Othewise, it is worth a pass."
1,What good there is undermined by bigotry,"Though Mr. Steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations, his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias (he titles one chapter ""The Fags"", and it's not meant affectionately). His readings of stories such as the reaction of Lorenz Hart upon hearing ""Oklahoma"" in a blackout could have been better informed by further research, and he repeats Lerner's silly comment about Lorenz Hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men. The book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of British Operettas and the public's acceptance of Stephen Sondheim. Rather than this book I would reccommend anything by Ethan Mordden or Martin Gottfried."
5,Best review of Broadway in years,"The Great White Way is in trouble. It's condition is terminal but not serious, as the Russians say. Whatever you think of the causes for that, you will enjoy this book, if you love theatre. Mr. Steyn provides an excellent, if short history of Broadway, interspersed with lively criticism of the 'state of the stage'. Sondheim, in particular, receives some cutting thrusts. Reading it, I alternatively wanted to shout in Mr. Steyn's face and shake him by the hand. I laughed, I cried, I threw the book across the room at least three times, but I couldn't put it down."
5,Go Steyn!,"""if you think PC is awful and white straight men have a right to insult everyone with no regards to manners or kindness, then you might enjoy it""That's great! That was the review that prompted me to buy this book. That rare sort of quality humor doesn't come along all too often these days. National Lampoon used to be the pinnacle of elite humor, back when my comic idol, P.J. O'Rourke was Editor-in-Chief.As always, Steyn entertains like no other. Buy this book; you'll want to re-read it quite often."
4,cool jazz harmonica,"When listening to this sweet album for the first time, I was transported into a new realm of jazz. Jazz harmonica? I never new such sounds could emanate from an instrument best suited to the last boxcar on the last train out of town. Meurkens makes music with his instrument and a fine music it is. His rendition of the Arlen standard ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" is soulful and elegant. It is a lovely album to own and to share with friends who are expanding their jazz horizons."
3,Don't believe Ms.Milano is on here.,"Hello: I don't own this, but it seems some reviews are confused ... the Alyssa movie ""Deadly Sins"" is not on this 4 movie pack ... only the 4 titles stated on the box cover! These being - Where Angels Dance, Dead By Dawn, Seaside Seduction and Firing Line. Alyssa's movie ""Deadly Sins"" was released on video tape in 1995 and is now out of print."
1,"DM of CA""Amazing Amazon.com""","I bought this 4 mini movies from Amazon. What a big mistakes. I should listened to a reviewer (haskpts). It's not Alyssa Milano, She is not there and the title are different. Can Amazon people out there to check on this. What in the... that it used her name. Hello, Amazon!!! You can do a better job. Now I have to pay the shipping cost to return it. The movies are low budget and too many deleted scenes. Not worth to own it. If you are buying it just for Alyssa Milano, make sure it is the right one. Otherwise, you ended up grabbing and pulling your hair like me."
2,Deadly Sins (4 mini movies),"I haven't seen all the movies on this DVD but there are two ""Deadly Sins"" movies. This one shows a series of four B-Rated movies: ""Loan Shark,"" ""Knightwalks,"" Dead By Dawn,"" and ""Firing Line."" The other ""Deadly Sins"" stars Alyssa Milano and David Keith."
1,You won't find it here....,"If you are in search of Alyssa Milano's Catholic School horror flick, Deadly Sins, keep on searching. The title of this DVD collection might be identical, but the collection does not include the film of the same title.We can only hope that it will be released on DVD format soon!"
1,"looks slick, poorly designed","I received this today and have to say I'm very disappointed. This item has a few serious design flaws. First, the wire spools out from both ends. As you pull the headphone jack end out, the video out wires unwind as well and easily tangle. It doesn't matter which end you pull out first.Second, the wire isn't rooted in the center and the retraction mechanism is pretty random. So, attempting to retract the cord you'll often end up with a long length of cord on one end or the other that hasn't retracted. It took me several tries to get it to retract evenly.Finally, the video connection cables are VERY thin. Maybe this is necessary to fit in a compact package, but they're so thin you worry they'll break when you pull them.I've attempted Boxwave to return this merchandise. I'd advise you not to order it at all."
2,offensive,"Although I learned a couple of things, I found that Ludwig writes in an arrogant holier than though and know it all manner. Clearly she does not have the credentials to preach like that and` I found it offensive. A book like this one would be better written by Pat Brown the Criminal Profiler or someone of that stature. I dont understand Larry Kings obsession with Ludwig,must be the ageing eye candy thing."
1,Awful and you don't even have to read it,"Just watching her on ""the view"" made me not want to read this book. Nancy Grace and Ann Rule can write about true crime. Not Ludwig.She has different theories for spouses who kill, Scott Peterson is the temper tatrum killer, but Lori Hack's was the neuortic/lying type killer. And Laci told Scott to grow up, and he wouldn't, and that's why he killed? Peterson who just as much a liar as Hack, if not more.HUH???It just seems like a lot of made up stuff. With 0 merit. And the woman who killed her preacher husband was probably Post partum , and she was without a mother figure.She may be a shrink, but she should really spend more time learning about ""true crime""Geez. She makes like that moron, Gilda who use to be on Sally Jessy seem smart."
4,Really fast,"I received the book two days after purchase. It was so fast! I bought other products at the same time that only started arriving 4 days later. It was new, looked perfect. Good book too"
1,Mildly Interesting,"I was given this book as a gift from my son, who knows of my interest in the subject. I read the entire book (it's a quick read!) while I was waiting to have my car serviced. One of the reviewers on this site said ""I've read better."" No kidding. I didn't realize what a good writer Ann Rule is until I read THIS book! Robi Ludwig should stick to looking cute on TV while giving her fluffy opinion of what makes the criminal mind work. That works better for her than actually putting those opinions down on paper. Even a ghost writer couldn't make her sound educated or literate."
2,Theres better out there,"If youd like a really good book on this subject read Gail SaltzMD new book ""Anatomy Of A Secret Life; The Psychology of Living A Lie"". Dr Saltz is a regular on the Today Show and many other shows. Having read both books Dr Saltz book is by far a better book, more researched, better written and has much more interesting information."
1,SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE,"This book is an example of how desperate publishers can be if they think they can make a sale. I am friends with Betty Broderick, a subject of the book, and I know a lot about her personality and her history. To claim that Betty was ""stalking"" her former husband is a clear indication that Ludwig doesn't have a CLUE what she's talking about -- she never met Betty or interviewed her, even long-distance! Don't waste your money on this piece of trash (or the book, either). Some people in prison were the victims of AWFUL circumstances, and to minimize the suffering that lead to their incarceration only adds to the suffering. Shame on everyone connected with this waste of otherwise good paper!"
1,"Somewhat interesting, but many factual errors.","I thought this would be an interesting and insightful book. Instead, I found a group of very familiar cases wrapped up in junk psychology. The author claims a PhD, but I'm not sure what in. Certainly not forensic psychology. Too many of her conclusions and explanations are based on outdated and discredited assumptions (e.g., homosexuality is rooted in strong mothers and weak fathers--increasingly eclipsed by genetic information), rather than solid research. The average person on the street could produce the same quality in a book. Save your money."
2,Textbook,"This book reads more like an advanced textbook than a pleasure read. I have a minor in psych and was having a hard time following some of the terms, etc. used to describe the people profiled. I don't mind a cerebral book, but I wasn't expecting a textbook when I bought this book."
3,A step in the right direction,"It was useful in my trip to India (lots of scheduled power cuts) but was also a nuisance to keep winding the charger more often that I wanted to. Charge does not actually last as long the manufacturer claims. If there was power failure or if you are going out in the woods this could come in handy though I am not sure how many nights one can survive with this.I also use it when there is power mainly to search for things, reading in the bed (single led mode), going for a walk after dark etc.So it takes a little bit of sacrifice to be eco-friendly (at least in perception) or independent from being tied to the store for everything."
2,Not so Simple,"We bought this to connect my Canon Rebel XS (D1000) to my father's Celestron spotting scope, but it is a job to get them this to thread right and stay put, and I do not feel comfortable having the lenses of both products exposed while I fidget with this. It was made of good materials and won't break, but we are looking to buy a new one directly from the manufacturer."
1,Don't cheap out,"I bought this Celestron T-ring to adapt a Televue Pronto to a Canon 40D. It does work but the fit is very loose and sloppy. It does not make me convinced that the camera is securely supported or that it holds the camera with any precision (optically speaking) to the scope.One other problem, at shutter speeds of 1/4000 or faster and using the live-view mode of the 40D, there is an under-exposed strip on the bottom of each exposure. Because I haven't tried the Canon T-ring I can't say whether this flaw is unique to the Celestron but I would recommend spending a few more bucks for the Canon T-ring for the better fit I would assume it has."
4,Great Story,Book was a great story in the continuing Leatherstocking series. Very descriptive of life and times of the area near and around the Niagara Falls and Niagara River area.
1,"After 13 months, the monitor stopped working","I am very disappointed with this product. I have had it for just over a year and it no longer works. The screen went black. I've been told Sony no longer manufactures plasma, I guess this is why."
5,Colt's fan,"Being from Indiana, I see a lot of ""blue"" shirts. I saw this one and it looked so unique. I ordered it and when it came, I wasn't disappointed. It is a nice shirt , made well and looks great! I have not seen anyone else with this shirt but have received lots of compliments. Love the Colts, love the shirt."
5,Very nice,"This shirt looks even better than the photo. It is a high quality shirt, and gets a lot of comments. I would recommend it to any fan."
1,Got wrong Color. Returned.,I ordered 3. When I got them the zippers were pink. Ugggh. If you use bleach I fear they could bleed. Second time this happened on a laundry bag product. The other was a round bag. Returning.
3,Solid inroduction,"This is a good place to start. Complex concepts explained in a comprehensible manner. For people already familiar with the basics will be looking for more, expecially on topics such as fixed income and multi-current portfolios."
5,Imports can be cool!,"Let me just say that these first three Final Destination movies are the baddest muthas out there! But this Canadian import box set is even sweeter. All three movies in Hi-Def. Can't beat it. Sure you get French writing on FD2 an FD3 but it's not overpowering. The first one is the only one with any features. Once you pop in part 2 and part 3 it takes you right to the movie. Sometimes this set is on sale for around 20 bucks. If you only dig the first three movies alone than this is the set to get. If you want all five (gazillion) than wait for a more complete box set. BTW, don't try and cheat death!"
5,Great product!,"Well, we had already watched all the movies separately but we decided to purchase the trilogy for our nephew as a birthday gift since he loves this kind of horror/terror/thriller movies.I'd classify Final Destination more like a thriller than horror, and it is not those silly and disgusting horror movies like See no Evil or Saw...I do believe if you watch number one and like it (I bet you will) you more than likely would be the kind of viewer who would love to have the trilogy."
2,no traction for my feet in down dog,"I was so frustrated with those so called ""sticky mats"", my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog.So I decided to give the $50 skidless yoga towel a try.This worked pretty well for my slipping hands, but i had a new problem. I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga. (downward facing dog, even poses like triangle and extended side angle). I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat (those rubber mats) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences.I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat, maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel.I realized with yoga mats that every person is different, so what doesn't work for me, may work for you. I just thought I would give my 2 cents."
5,Best purchase for sweaty yogis!,"After sweating and slipping in many a vinyasa class (even on a ""non-slip"" mat), a friend recommended this yoga towel. This product has saved my yoga practice! It does take one or two classes to get used to, but once you do, you are off to non-slip yoga bliss. Plus, the well-placed circle at the top of the mat gives you a visual to focus on to stay centered. Thank you Yogitoes!"
3,"Good slippage control for hands, but not feet","I have this in pink, which was only made for October 2005, for Breast Cancer Awareness month. I love the color of mine. I considered buying one for quite a while, but didn't like the chakra color selection. I wanted something more pastel, so fortunately I was shopping for it in October. Current color selection is a minus.This towel is really good for controlling slippage in my hands, but not my feet. My feet seem to slip more than usual, so I don't use this towel frequently. It seems to work better when I am sweating more. I also have a theory that fabric softener may make it more slippery, but that's just a theory.It's also a bit of a pain to deal with when moving into poses where I need to move or fold the mat.Currently my mat is on it's last legs, so it helps helps keep me from getting little chunks of mat all over myself while I find the perfect mat to replace it. It's good for extending the life of your mat."
5,Quality built hand tool!!,"I used this to pull up three layers of flooring and subfloor during my kitchen remodel, the handle is quality wood and did not flex even with me overloading it, the scraper head cut thru many of the flooring neils, nice to see that there are still some simple well made tools available.."
5,one of the best autobiographies I've read,"Mike Burke certainly did have outrageous good fortune in his lifetime. From OSS and CIA operative in WWII and the Cold war to Pres/CEO of Ringling Bros Circus, VP at CBS , Pres/CEO/Part owner of the NY Yankees, Pres/CEO of Madison Square Garden which included The Knicks and Rangers and finaling retiring to Ireland. An exciting, well-written chronicle of a very busy full life. He describes his friendships with Hemingway, Bill Donovan,Kim Philby,George Steinbrenner, William Paley,Reggie Jackson, Mickey Mantle and some not-so-friendly as Jimmy Hoffa and more. A cast of characters passed through his life that a fictional book author couldn't have better picked. I frankly couldn't put the book down."
1,What a dunce.,"Anyone who would classify the Tibetan Book of the Dead as the occult either hasn't read it or (mostly likely) didn't understand it. If you want to find out for yourself, I'd recommend Tsogyal Rinpoches the Book of Living and Dying"
3,Urban Legends,"I'm about 2/3 of the way through this book and I have to say it's okay to read for the fun of it, but it is riddled with misinformation. On the first couple of pages Lachman makes reference to Charles Manson's audition for the Monkees; there was no such audition. He also goes on and on about Anton LaVey, all of whose stories about his life have been debunked. (You can find the truth about him elsewhere on the internet). This kind of stuff kills the credibility of the rest of it, for me, anyway. Go ahead, if you're bored, though. Give it a read"
4,Polish Study,This CDROM is indepth and will you give a taste of the polish language. Learn the accent before traveling to Poland along with basic phrases and numbers. It took awhile for me to pick up on the language but will be a valuable tool for anyone looking into learning some Polish.
4,Fun w/ Polish,"This is a very fun product, thats also very effective. This product features two actual native polish speakers one male one female. You learn by seeing pictures of the word your learning accompanied by how you'd say it in polish. The course is divided into different sub-categories of study, ""Food, Numbers, Body Parts, Phrases, Etc.."" and within each of these areas of study you begin buy learning the word by associating it to its picture. Once you learned the words you can play easy & hard games designed to test your memory. There's also a feature that allows you to hook up a mic and test your pronunciation, which i guess is then compared against the correct pronunciation. I haven't tried using this feature yet. Overall this is a good BEGINNERS product."
4,Nice software,"I just received the CD-ROM and made a general tour. Indeed that's nice software with nice features. I just expected to have a little more lessons, as there are 9 sets of words to learn, each corresponds to a lesson. And there is also a memory game with all words learned.For sure you won't be able to understand more than a few words and basic phrases but that's a very good starting point.One think is you got to listen Polish in order to learn the pronunciation. At least for a complete beginner as me, you've got use a CD, just a book won't help a lot."
5,Perfect shoe tree,"Great quality cedar, a simple mechanism, and a relatively affordable price make for a shoe tree that meet all of the needs that anyone should have. Any less and the tree is lacking. Any more, and you are paying for unnecessary features."
1,Avoid The Organization Store Seller,"One fundamental aspect of organization isthe ability to recognize a contained objectby its label.It is easy to discern this item as ""shoe trees.""Men's shoes and women's shoes are different.Originally, these shoe trees were marketed asbeing unisex with a general indication of whichmen's/women's shoes they would fit.Presently, they are described as unisex.However, the shoe trees received are clearlylabeled on their box as being for women'sshoes.So if you are a woman, shop with someconfidence, but not too much becauseif the nondescript sizing informationleaves you with unfit shoe trees, youwill have to pay for shipping in additionto the inconvenience of returningthis item."
2,Sent it back,"I bought this as an open box return from Amazon. I found the lens to be soft and to have an odd color cast. I ended up returning it to Amazon as it was just not up to my standards that I am used to. I have owned other Sigma lenses that were fine (10-20mm and 70-300mm for Nikon).It could have been because it was a return but, unfortunately, Sigma has discontinued this lens so I had little choice but to try for a non-new one."
2,Sigma lens,"As far as sharpness vs. cost is was a good lens, we ended up returning it for one main reason, the zoom ring was so loose if you pointed the lens downward it would rotate on its own. granted you aren't going to be shooting strait down but if you move positions and tilt the lens down during repositioning the lens will not maintain the same zoom focal length."
5,Great,"This Lady is one of the best voices in Jazz ever to grace our ears. Her style may be traditional, maybe even ""old school"", in that she sings and gives the band some playing time, yet that is precisely what makes her CD great. Buy this with no reservations. Her voice alone will make it worth the price."
1,Wasn't available,"I wanted it. I ordered it. I received a note that although it was listed, they didn't have it."
4,This is Brother Rabbit?,"The artwork of the book is excellent and the format is great but if you want the original feel of the Joel Chandler Harris stories go out and get the originals. The language used by Harris is challenging for both reader and listener, however, and this book by Lester may present a good alternative when reading the stories to young children or if you are not particulary apt with reading different dialects."
2,Not the real thing,"This is just a watered down version, by replacing the colorful language they have also taken away part of the beauty of the story. I wish I had not wasted my money on this version."
4,Decent Vernacular,"I tried to read the original Joel Chandler stories to my 5 year old son and found that the only way to do it was to read the stories on my own and then tell him a ""translated"" version at bedtime. This book was far easier to use, and I was able to read the stories to him verbatim. Much more appropriate for small children than the original..."
3,Non stop fighting action,"this kotc set brings some of the better kotc from 1-4 in a 2 disc 4 event set, I like these early events more than the latest ones, more action, more good knockouts."
4,Star Jumper Journal of a Cardboard Genius,"After reading this book, you'll want to go buy a roll of duct tape and get a few boxes. Young genius Alex can tackle any challenge with a little cardboard and that famous tape. A lively story of two brothers: One genius, the other obnoxious. Or is he? Big brother Alex, a math whiz kid, will soon remove himself from the dread of little brother Jonathan, as his Star Jumper spaceship leaps him to another corner of the galaxy. But Jonathan has ideas of his own, and reveals HIS inventive side."
2,"To say the least, I am disappointed.","I know that this is a kids book. And we've loved other books by the same author. I know he was trying to show the frustration of the older brother with the younger brother. But, phrases like ""poopy head"" and such do not seem appropriate to this age who are still learning to filter what is appropriate. I gave these three books to my oldest daughter (an avid reader) for her birthday. She was more than thrilled to ""share"" with us the words she found in them. I know she has been somewhat sheltered, but honestly, do we really need to steep our children in the progressive decline in civil language. She is not allowed to speak nastily to her little sister or anyone else for that matter. To say the least, I am disappointed."
4,Comfortable,These are very comfortable and not too hot like your typical tennis shoe. I like these because they offer more support and traction than a sandle.
5,These are delicious.,Wish the calorie count was less. Tried to eat only half and ended up eating the other half because it tastes so good. Great item to keep in your car for when you are hungry.
2,Only useful for the practice exams,"This prep book is marginal at best. I quickly got through the few pages of study material and was surprised to find that the questions on the practice exams didn't cover what was presented earlier. Funnier yet, I recently took the formal exam and it was even further afield of the prep exams, having what seemed like 5% of the questions based on web-centric marketing and technical questions like differences between intranets and extranets. I did pass the test, but I doubt it was with the help of this book."
4,Very easy to read and understand.,"I passed the exam with plenty of points to spare and did not have to expend time in a class to get the 3 semester hours. The book suggests a longer study guidline than what I used, but I believe the results would have been the same."
4,Useful tool for studying,"I used this book as my sole preparation for the Marketing CLEP test. While the book has a lot of information, it is broken down into well organized sections to help you focus on areas you may need more help on. The practice tests were helpful but I thought the answer explanations could have been better written. Overall, I thought this was a very useful tool for preparing for the test. However, when I took the test I thought the book had focused in some areas to much on trival information."
2,Clep Study guide for the principles of marketing exam.,I would not recommend using this book to study for the Clep exam. I have found that a Marketing text book sold at any college bookstore to be more useful. I feel that I did well on the exam due to reading and reviewing the textbook. The study guide contained only approximately 10% of the information that was on the test.
3,"Becoming Outdated, Needs Improvement","I suppose if you studied this book exclusively and well, you would pass the marketing exam, as it is comparitively easy. I also used a modern college text and was very glad. For example, the actual exam may have plenty of questions regarding internet marketing, which is not covered. The book is weak covering marketing research and the terminology / definitions are becoming dated. I found a significant portion of the sample questions to be poor/mediocre. I would score 72 percent on those, but aced the actual exam (79/80)."
4,Good resource for CLEP,"For the CLEP:Principles of Marketing, I studied mostly from this book, and to some extent from Barron's Business Review-Marketing.The book is useful because :- it covers almost all the topics needed for study- the questions are similar ( difficulty level, type , etc.)to the actual test questions- the explanations to the questions are helpful in understandingthe topicsSome drawbacks are :- The study matter/chapters are too brief ( the questions andthe answers sort of compensate for that )- Internet/e-commerce is left outOverall, this book would definitely help in passing the CLEP exam. I took mine yesterday and got 74."
4,Nice review of material,"This is a good book to study from. I just took the test yesterday and did fairly well. They have changed the format of the exam moving from paper based to computer based and have added more material not covered in this book such as internet marketing. Overall, this was a great buy."
4,Good Foundation,"The book served as a good basic source for the Marketing CLEP. However I found it missing concept and terminology in contemporary marketing. No internet marketing which CLEP test does contain. In addition to this book, I studied a current marketing textbook and passed the test. In my estimate 20% of the test is common sense, 50% can be learned from this book, and the remaining 30% coming from a current marketing textbook. Besides taking the practice exams in this book, which are quite good, I suggest one review the marketing practice exams provided by CLEP at Collegeboard.com"
1,Amazon:Misleading conduct,"A Sparkplug is a sparkplug, but I am offended about Amazon's misleading advertising. If I had known that the free postage offer would not be honoured, I would have examined the other offers much more carefully, and probably made a different decision!PeterB"
2,NGK,"Well, the product is what it is supposed to be.I wasn't very satisfied with their shipping. It took too long."
5,melodic,We enjoy his records very much. The music brings back very good memories. The clarity and sound are wonderful. I have never had a problem with purchasing cd's from Amazon. For those people who like this kind of music I would reccommend it anytime.
4,"Good story, but not as satisfying as ""Running with the Demon","John Ross has renounced his pledge as a Knight of the Word after he failed to save the lives of schoolchildren in a tragedy. He's now working for a homeless shelter in Seattle and trying to build a life for himself.Nest Freemark is now a college student. She comes to Seattle to warn John that a Demon's after him and eventually will try to seduce him into the service of the Void.This one's not as much of a page-turner as ""Running with the Demon."" Interest in what happens to Ross and Freemark is what keeps you reading rather than the plot itself. Overall, a decent followup, but not a thriller like ""Running."""
4,"Mild, but yet stunning!",Eventhough it starts out really slow. It soon jumps into a major climatic story about denying what you are called to do. John Ross and Ness Freemark are the ultimate in new age fantasy charecters. I would recommend it to anyone who would dare to try and contain its power.
2,Definitely not equal to Running . . .,The is the first time that I've seen Brooks stumble. The plot isn't very believable or strong and the whole theme doesn't capture you like Running did. The whole five-year jump is annoying since you want to know what happened during those years. Running was spell-binding and page-turning in its intensity . . . this one just doesn't measure up.
2,This book let him down.,"TOTAL READING TIME 4HOURS.I have read nearly all of his books and no doubt I will continue to read his work, but this one i found him repeating the same storey line on a number of occasions throughout this novel, which let it down, saying that I will continue to read his writings as I know he will get back to his overwhelming creativity with words and plots again."
2,What a disappointment.,"I enjoyed the first book and was really looking forward to this sequel. But...What a disappointment.The plot was totally predictable so kiss suspense goodbye. And the demons in this book are pussycats. When the main characters are not too stupid to realize that they talking to a demon, they can pretty much blow them away.Brook patronizes us by being repetitive. Don't worry Terry, we can follow this plot."
2,a huge nose dive,"Brooks' new series started with promise, but has taken a terribly wrong turn. This book was rife with inconsistency and poor pacing, not to mention the total lack of drama. I have had nothing but the highest praise for Brooks in the past, but this latest volume was an extreme disappointment. In addition, these characters fall short of the norm for Brooks. I found myself wondering who cared what the hell was happening in this book and, for the first time, was tempted to put this book aside unfinished. I look forward to the third and FINAL installment of this series. Perhaps the Star Wars novelization will make up for this travesty. if not, we have the rumored return of Shannara in 2000."
3,Super Reader,"It is now a few years later, and John Ross, Knight of the Word, has lost his way. Or, he just wants to lead a normal life. This is a common complaint of the superpowered. He decides to settle down, have a relationship, do a bit of social work and that sort of thing.This is very seductive, and just what the Void wants. Nest Freemark must try and snap John out of it, at considerable risk, as if the Void doesn't get to him, the Word may send an agent to remove the risk he now poses."
2,"Come on, Terry. Get with it.","This was a disappointing, mediocre book. Having read every book Terry Brooks has written, I found myself knowing how the book would end well before I should. The plot twists are as obvious as a parade down Main Street. Mr. Brooks should stop considering himself a successful writer and go back to basics. Otherwise, his fans can find other authors to read. He needs to be hungry and creative, not complacent and boring."
4,A good sequel,"I enjoyed this book, but would have like more story that involved Nest (which is one of my favorite characters in Brook's books). The best part of the story is the who done it of the demon's identity."
3,Good but predictable!,I enjoyed reading the book but was able to predict the ending/demon about halfway through the book! Will keep your interest provided you want to read the details even though you deduced the ending/demon.
3,A interesting book filled with some adventure and descriptio,It exerts the demon in John Ross's life and it also explains the magic that we all have in ourselves. it is a little on the lopside with the adventures but it gives great descriptions of the characters and really shows them in the real world.
2,A much un needed sequel,"Running With the Demon was an exellent piece of work, and then there is this. In my opinion, a book as good as Running would only be ruined with a sequel, and it was. Sorry Terry, you just cant add onto everything."
2,"A Brooks novel for ""Thirtysomething"" fans....","Mr. Brooks issues another installment in the Running with the Demon series, but this time it is as predictable as all the other reviewers have stated. If you read the first book in the series, you will already know who the demon is when they are first introduced in the second book. On top of this, the characters in this book are even more overwrought and whiny than ever. Even the demon takes time out at the end of the book to whine about her problems and situation. Whine, worry, and contemplate; it does not add up to an active plot. For those readers spoiled by Shannara and Landover, you can hope that Mr. Brooks redeems this series with the third installment this fall. The first book was good; hopefully the third will wrap things up competently."
2,Rehash,"Just another story using the same themes as Running With the Demon, which wasn't that great in the first place. May be OK for youth readers, but not for a serious reader."
2,What's wrong with Terry Brooks,"Nest is one of the more interesting characters Brooks has created, yet she does essentially nothing in this entire book. She seems to have this incredible power but we are barely made aware of it. What's the point in creating a great character if you don't use her? How about a bit more character development? This book reads like an outline, very sketchy with little filling in it. I was a huge Terry Brooks fan but in the last 3 years he has left me cold."
2,Good but not Great,Im a big Terry Brooks fan this book was good but not one of his best. I read the 2nd book 1st so that takes away from the plot a bit. All in all it was a pretty good read
2,Very predictable; falls short of the first novel,This is a very disappointing follow up to the first novel in this series. Very predictable plot; no real drama. Brooks had a chance to create an interesting series but has fallen way short with this second book. We learn a little more about the characters but not enough to care.I will be hard pressed to continue with this series which in itself is disappointing. What happened to Brooks since Shannara?
2,More of the same.,"Don't get me wrong, I like Terry Brooks; or rather I liked him. While this book did keep me turning pages, it was more out of habit than anything else. I had read _Running with the Demon_, and mildly enjoyed it, so I bought this expecting more of the same. Well, I guess I got it. The story was eminently predictable: I ferreted out nearly all of the plot twists from the beginning. If you're a diehard Brooks fan, you might as well read the book, but otherwise I wouldn't reccomend it."
4,"Great try, but it's no Running w/ the Demon","Terry Brooks did nothing less than change my life with Running with the Demon so of course it was a tough act to follow. Brooks did an admirable job,but he really needs to throw the series for a loop. This one was good but the whole mystery behind the demon's identity was way too predictable. Keep in mind that I suck at mysteries.That aside, it was still a riveting read, blending faerie magic with post-apocalyptic visions, and it nothing short of visionary."
3,Good but not enough action,"I enjoyed and wished all Christmas to read this book. Finally I got it from the local library. I was so intrested I read it in 4 days. I was somewhat disappointed in his writing. His first had suspense, action, gore, and mystery this one had low action, low gore and way too slow. I am now waiting for Terry Brooks' 3rd demon book, hoping that this one will be the best of them all."
5,Entertaining. Another great series by Terry Brooks.,"I don't know who these ""reviewers"" are but they are probably the same people who think only ""deep"" movies like Ghandi are worthwhile.I liked this book. It was entertaining and I think it made the character of John Ross more believeable. He got tired of all the problems and failures and quit. I think everyone can relate to this. He's also taken in by someone he loves and trusts. This is also very human. I think explioting John's weaknesses in this book made it more real.I look forward to the next ""Knight"" book."
2,"Enjoyable read, but way too predictable. Not his best.","Terry Brooks is one of my favorite authors, and I thouroughly enjoyed the Shannara series, and Running With the Demon, and this book continues the tradition of easy, fun reading that made the other books such great sellers.On the other hand, though, this book was WAY too predictable, with the major antagonist being obvious early on in the book. In fact, I was getting really annoyed when Brooks didn't reveal who the demon was. I mean, is there anyone out there that completely suspended thought, and didn't have a good clue as to who it was?Personally, I would have enjoyed it more if the book would have focused around the suprises to the characters, rather than to us.All in all, it was a fun read, but nothing more."
5,This book is a favorite!,I loved both Running with the Demon and this book. Nest is one of my favorit characters in any book and I really enjoyed the story line. It's a fun read and since it's pretty short it goes fast and is exciting. I can't wait for book 3 and I hope to learn more about the creatures higher up in the ranks of the Void and the Word. I also wonder will Nest run in the Olympics or will her magic and forces take her life in a different direction....
1,Sequel identical to the 1st book...?,"I picked up KNIGHT because I found the first book of the series, RUNNING, somewhat interesting if not original (good vs. evil being a popular theme in fantasy books and all). Unfortunately it seems that Brooks is following the age old adage: if it works, don't fix it. This book is plagued with the same problems as the first: predictable plot and slight lack of suspense. Also, the written format is identical to the first, with the prologue/what-might-be epilogue at the beginning and the chapter/day division. Lastly, there's a huge tangent revolving around the ""plight of the homeless"" which is totally unnecessary and has very little to do with the *real* plot, John's fall from grace. I do hope Brooks other works are an improvement upon this one."
3,Not alot of passion-except for Jehan,"found this video selling sex and not the art of belly dance. Belly dance should be sensual, but I did not feel this was in the true spirit of belly dance. The words to several of the songs more suited for a strip club. examples: ""With every breath I wait for you naked and pure"". ""I want you, I want you, I want you, over and over and over again"". ""Feel sexy as your sweat drips"".Another song was rap, and one costume was see through. I think they were trying to put a different spin on belly dance, like some have done with bollywood, or flamingo, but this just did not work.I gave this three stars because, these girls can dance. This was just not my style, and belly dance has a bad name. I think belly dancers should strive to change that.I did like the sword duo. Jehan was also good. My recomendation..rent it, don't buy it."
3,"Lovely dancers, lovely performances, nothing spectacular.","Fair production value, although the dances/dancers are very poorly lit at times. Bellydance fans will probably appreciate this DVD. Bellydancers may find it repetitive. There are four beautiful women performing on the CD (one is full figured goddess Jehan) and only three pictured on the cover (the slim ones). Tsk tsk..."
2,Chics kinda hot...dancin' kinda NOT!,"That pretty much explains it all. I think I've seen women work their hips better in local clubs then in the video. There were a few nice hand movements and hip simulations...about 3...mostly from Blanca, but overall it was dissapointing. I wanted to feel the heat, but nothing got beyond luke warm. I wouldn't buy the video...unless maybe you are looking for patterns for a belly-dancing costume or something."
3,"Ok, but not great","It gets a bit repetitive, some dancers have good technique but no passion. It left me feeling like there was something missing."
4,Golden Apple Stars of New York-Belly Dancers,"I found this video to be well presented and professional.The content is exciting and well performed. The dancers show their talent very well and if I have one negative comment it is that I think the dances are more inclined towards the Western concept of the dance rather than the authentic Eastern.Nevertheless, all the performers show excellent talent.I would reccommend this video to anyone interested in Belly Dancing."
3,It depends on what you like....,"It has a lot of new age type music. Wasn't really my cup of tea. But I always love to watch Neon, as she is an amazing dancer."
5,Great homily preparation helper,"This book is a help to put a pastoral insight on the gospels. Thus, it becomes a great help for homily preparation. Not overburdened with exegetical nuances or historical-critical method. Very weel done"
3,Odd.,"Since I'm at the age where greys will pop up, I'm not upset that they didn't disappear. I wasn't expecting them to. I was hoping that it would stop some thinning which it apparently has. I was also hoping it would help with dryness and it did not. I naturally dark red hair. It looks a weird shade of brown unless I'm in bright light then I turn into Lucy or as my niece once called me, Ronald McDonald. I stopped dying my hair about a year ago and discovered that like my father's hair had done, mine was now naturally darker. After 2 weeks of taking the Shou Wu I realized my hair was lighter and red. That was an unexpected effect. Do the pills work? Yes. Will they do exactly what you wish for them to? Probably not."
1,Be wary,"I thought wow what a great thing. I can finally stop coloring my hair. Well, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.I took it for a week and starting having severe stomach pains and diarrhea. I started checking into the side effects and found it can cause LIVER malfunction and failure if taken too long. The stomach pains and diarrhea were symptoms of the liver problems it was creating. I stopped using it. I started feeling better after a few days. I have not taken it since."
4,My son is 17 mos old and can't get enough of this video,Lots of music. Great for young ones and preschoolers alik
3,Shorter than I expected,"The listed run time is NOT 60 minute, as is listed. It is actually about 30 minutes, which I find is a pretty inconvenient length. It is a pain to keep coming back to the t.v. to rewind & change the tape for my 2-yr-old. Otherwise, my son enjoys Elmo."
4,Game show concept...,"The game show concept is a little advanced for a 24 month old, it is not a full bust at this age because my daughter loves the skits, songs and classic cartoons that is placed through out so it DOES get watched. I think she will fully enjoy this movie at age 3 or 4."
3,Not the best Sesame Street video - choose another,"My 2-year-old loves Sesame Street, but this video entertains neither of us. It's kind of aimless and silly. I highly recommend ""Do the Alphabet"" or ""123 Count with Me."" They're great, educational and lots of fun."
1,Elmo's Sing-Along Guessing Game,This is the first time I have found a Sesame Street video to be inappropriate for my grandchild age two. Why? The guessing game is set up in a contestant format and both the contestants (Elmo and other muppets) and the MC's speak rudely to each other and also show no manners when trying to be the first to answer the question. The questions are simple so I don't think a child would learn much even if rudeness were not a factor. I recommend any Blue's Clues video if you want your child to learn about guessing.
4,Great fun,"This is a totally fun video and my 2 yr old just loves it! Grant it, the video has no educational value, but it does provide lots of smiles for the both of us! Sometimes, it's ok to take a break from the learning and just enjoy yourself. This video is great for that kind of time!"
5,We Love It!,"My 10 month old son absolutely loves this DVD. He's been watching it since he was 4 months old and it still keeps his interest. Even my husband and I are not tired of it yet and we've seen it countless times. Elmo teaches kids the parts of their face, numbers, and about being friends! I highly recommend it!"
1,Not good for fine hair,"These tweezers are so not worth $5 that I barely know where to start. As you can see from the picture, the light is positioned in the middle. I should have realized that this was a design flaw because it automatically means that the tweezers cannot maintain a grip on small hairs.If you intend to use these tweezers only for eyebrows, they will work fine. There is enough grip to hold onto thicker, longer hairs and yank them out (ouch). However, if you are in the menopause crowd, like me, and have unwanted facial hair (i.e., whiskers) on your chin, these will not work at all. These tweezers will not hold onto, much less pull out, these tough little hairs. They are absolutely the worst for this purpose that I have ever seen."
5,Great product,This product works exactly as advertised. It is wonderful as it improves the ability to see the small hairs. It was shipped quickly and with no problems. I am planning on buying this as a stocking stuffer for all my girlfriends!
4,A useful resource for graphic artists and others,"As someone who grew up in Africa, I find myself drawn to African culture. I have used some of the nearly 400 illustrations in this book for various purposes, from website design artifacts to home decoration. Designs can be used at will. The designs are well categorised. North Africa and East Africa are not as well represented as the other parts of the continent, but you'll still find a good variety an this book's pages. Dates, and an index by region would have been useful."
4,Good Info,"This Book is not meant to be an incredible mind bending guide, or an extremely dull informative textbook. Instead this is a book in the middle of both extremes, it provides interesting information without being boring about the evolutionary process sex has take over history. This book is not some Hopper guide to great sex, but rather an interesting historical/scientific view of sex. For those who are interested in love, touch, relationships, and sex."
3,SEX: A Natural History,"I haven't finished the book, but so far I haven't found many parallels between my own experience with sex and those presented in the book. My wife and I were great sex partners until I contracted Parkinson's (age 35); and she lost her source of estrogen (hysterectomy) at age 43. My loss of coordination and her loss of desire sounded a death knell on our intimacy. I was hoping to find some possible solutions to our dilemma, but so far no luck!"
1,Did not fit 2004 Ford Ranger,This product did not fit my brother's 2004 Ford Ranger. Check you car's connection before ordering. Had to order the Metra 70-1771 16-pin wiring harness for Ford/Lincoln/Mazda 1998-Up.
1,Not true,I have a 2000 ford focus SE and this DOES NOT FIT!!! I now have no choice but to hard wire it in NOT HAPPY.
5,its exactli what i spected and what i order,well is just hou look like som of the arnes cables not come but my sterio is workin just fine.i choos this reting becaus my product came on time not have to contact the celler and i got the product in perfect conditions on the estimate date.well what is no like me is the not ol cables com in the arnes but it ok acan fix that that the onli ting then i dislike.i recomended this product for ol the people who have the original arnes cut u can fixie whit product fits just fine.
2,Didn't work with my car,"I don't know if I accidently orderd the wrong one, or the description was wrong, or they sent the wrong one but it didn't work for my 2001 Ford Focus."
4,Works as advertised!,This wiring harness was purchased to enable replacement of the original stereo on my 1997 F150 XLT. It fits perfectly and works great. this enables you to replace the stereo without cutting the factory wiring.
5,All Good,This item worked perfectly. It is well worth the cost. It will save you time and effort. Have a nice day.
1,Doesnt fit all 85-04 Ford's,This product does not fit all applications listed. I have a 1995 Ford Explorer and this is not the correct wiring harness. Just a fyi for those looking.
3,Unknown,I can not review this item since it was a gift and we have not heard from the recipiets about the product.
4,Burnin',"Bruno (g) Craig Thomas (b) Steve Holloway (d). Bruno is an excellent guitar player with terrific chops. A Philly guy, he is being hailed as a respected new talent on guitar. That talent is on display in force here, especially on the title track (a blues) and THE ETERNAL TRIANGLE, which swings mightily. And Jimmy can play a pretty ballad, too, as witness Coltrane's CENTRAL PARK WEST. Recommended."
3,"Good, but too edgy for me.","There are many nice cuts on this and I have listened to it quit a few times, but it is hard edged and too fast for my taste."
4,If You're Serious About Outdoor Photography,"Cokin has been the go to product for graduated neutral density (ND) filters for many years and this is no exception. Why do I give it four stars instead of five? First: these filters are getting harder and harder to find, so I'm very concerned about the Cokin companies future. Are they going out of business?? Second: It seems that after they've been used for a few months or more, no matter how clean it is, if you point them towards the sun you get a LOT of noise and spots effectively rendering them useless into the sun for sunset/sunrise, especially if the rest of the scenery in the photo is dark.Having said all that, I use mine a lot and would not want to be without it. It is quality built and shaded.I've seen some other brands available and unless Cokin starts making their filters easier to find, I'll try them next time."
4,Good!,When i first started drinking this tea... I broke out.. which got me researching more on this... breaking out is a sign of it actually cleaning your system... so I love it... after i got used to the tea... i stopped breaking out...
2,Do not like the side effects - Breakouts!,The taste of this tea is 5 star however I'm giving two stars because I did not appreciate breaking out. If it wasn't for that I would have continued taking this tea.
1,NOT for beginners,"Not for beginners or the faint of heart. Instructions are often incomplete, sometimes entirely missing, and occasionally just plain wrong! Expect to spend a lot of time using Maya Help and other books to try (often unsuccessfully) to figure things out."
5,Best Friends DVD,Have always loved this movie. Had it on VHS. Replaced it with this DVD. Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn. Romance and Comedy. You can't miss.
3,Delicous -- Until the Last 15 Minutes,"We got this movie because our Innovative-in-1982, High-Rise, Condo Complex -- The Rotonda -- was in it. The Newly-Weds' visits to their weird parents in Buffalo and McLean were carried out very well by the excellent supporting cast. We are delighted by our five buildings' appearance -- and by the Stars' Performances until the last 15 minutes when they became ultra-stupid."
3,Best Friends,This was very entertaining until the violent scene at the end but typical for the mindset of society in the early 1980's.
2,a blast from the past,"i do like bert and love goldie.but this movie just was not to my liking.i know many people that have traveled that same road,including me.who knows?...some movies you love others not so much."
5,Hard to find,I remembered this little remembered movie from the 80s and had a hard time finding it. Good flick. Way underrated
3,Old but still funny,Relaxed enjoyment - some real funny parts. I remembered enjoying it when it came out so it was a 'trip' down memory lane.
3,"Enjoyable, but drags a bit...","Burt Reynolds and Goldie Hawn are two of the most likeable actors in Hollywood, so it's natural that a movie that places them on-screen together is bound to be great, right?Well, for the most part.Yes, the two do have a natural chemistry, and the premise of the movie is decent enough. But as the movie progresses -- and as their characters' love affair begins to disintigrate -- the laughs get fewer and farther between and you might find yourself wanting to see what's on TV. However, if you fight through the lulls that dominate the middle-third of ""Best Friends,"" you'll be rewarded with perhaps the best part of the movie -- the end. Ron Silver is great as a Stephen Spielburg-ish director, and seeing Burt and Goldie make up is worth watching the grueling break-up."
2,Don't Bother With This...,"Save your money. This DVD is outdated (2000) given that it does not compare to the depth and diversity of information available on the internet. There is lots of information on the web that is just as good or better, whether it be in video form or on discussion forums. I gave it two stars because I did learn a little bit, but not enough to make it worth buying. I thought it was much more in-depth than it turned out to be. The main feature is less than 75 minutes long."
3,Not so interesting,"I got this ""Erotic Seductions"" tape. It is not as entertaining as the ""Erotic Fantasies"" series. Wouldn't buy it again."
1,French Cheesy,"Originally TV show, Lauren Hutton introduces the show and the commercial breaks, but is not in Paris herself. The tour guides for the show that are in Paris recommend only very expensive hotels and restaurants; only the briefest glimpses are given of the sights, and the camerman is fond of tilting the camera as if you were on a ship in a storm. If you are planning to go to Paris and this video is in your local library system, go ahead and watch it. Don't spend money for it."
3,make sure it's 3 way mogul base=to,"in order for me to be able to use this bulb 1st and formost, it needs to be a 3 way bulb. I don't know of any single way mogul base lamps for the home use. the alternative, is if you can fit it in the socket and housing, use an adapter mogul to med base socket."
2,Be warned - this thing is HUGE!,"I'm not talking about the base -- I knew when I ordered it that a mogul base is larger than a standard base. The problem I had was the length. This bulb is easily twice as long as the GE Incandescent Mogul Base Bulb that I was hoping to replace. So, unfortunately, it didn't fit in our lamp. It would be great if Amazon or the manufacturer could list the height dimensions in the product description to avoid future problems."
5,Great sequel,"This is the second story arc out of 3 which have been animated from the novels. Fulfilling the promise she made 3 years ago at the end of Crest of the Stars, Lafiel recruits Jinto to the bridge crew of her attack ship Basroil. The crew are training for the war that soon begins and escalates through the rest of the series. While the immense Starfleet Navy finally takes the offensive, Lafiel is sent to the front lines where attrition is high and the fate of her relatively small ship is never certain.The story fits right in with Crest of the Stars, which felt incomplete at its end. While the first series introduced the mystique of the Abh wonderfully in the first two shows, the story seemed to stray from that. Be assured the Abh and their epic conflict return to center stage. Given the normal run of 26 or 39 episodes for a show, this is only halfway through despite the title change, and fans of space opera who enjoyed Crest will be well pleased."
1,Do NOT waste your time,"I was expecting a documentary about how the Oklahoma City bombing was planned, carried out, etc. Instead, all this video offers are news clips from the day it happened. A complete waste of time."
2,Not what I expected,"When I recieved the product I did not get what I thought I was going to get.It was not R-7 ear powder, it is some off brand or something.I mean it works I guess for what it says on the bottle I got, but I was expecting ear drying powder and that is not what I got."
1,It was empty,"When the product arrived, the container was empty. Nothing in the bottle. So, I can't rate it. I am not one to take the time to return a product unless it is expensive enough to warrant the return. However, it was really a shock to order something and receive an empty container."
1,SHRANK!,"This product seems to work well until you wash it. I followed the instructions for laundering and drying and, upon attempting to fit it back on my bed, found that it had shrank considerably.Right now, it's out of stock on Amazon; if it comes back, I'd recommend you avoid....."
4,Mattress covers,"This Sealy product seems to work as advertised--it fits well, stays in place on the newer thick mattresses, and the waterproof feature is perfectly silent--no crinkle noises. No one has spilled anything on it as yet, so we aren't sure how the waterproofing works--thus the four stars instead of five. ( We really hope we don't have it tested by kids or pets!) But it does seem like a good quality item for the money."
3,Funny with a tinge of horror,"In ""Bunnicula,"" which is narrated by a dog, a rabbit discovered in a movie theater turns out to be a vampire--or does it? The family cat is convinced and goes to great lengths to protect his oblivious family, landing himself in hot water more than once. There are nice touches for adults in this book (e.g., the mysterious delivery of the manuscript), and everyone will find the action amusing. The ending is a little pat and comes too quickly. The book is good for reading aloud, but not so compelling that it can't be put down. Younger children may be a little scared by the vampire aspect."
5,Vastly superior to Twilight,"I read this book many times as a child. It is narrated by a dog and is about a family and their pets, which include the narrator, a cat, and a strange bunny they find in a cardboard box at a Dracula movie. The cat is convinced that the rabbit is actually a vampire! The dog is not so sure. What I liked best about the book were all the puns."
5,This is a great book to read your kids,This book is an absolutely delightful tale for kids. My children adore it. We have already read it twice since getting it.
5,a fine mystery with what will happen next suspence.,"This is a book where if you read at school maybe alittle on the dole side beacause of your teachers droning words but is great if you have a vivide imagination like chester, the cat in the story, it can be fun and exciteing. harold ,the teller of the story seems to not think the mesterious bunnicula is a vampir but chester the curious cat, finds out his suprisly scary secret and the trouble he gets into to find itis rediculesly funny!"
1,Too Implausible for Me,"Yeah, right. I just read this entire ""book"" and I don't buy a couple things.1. A dog couldn't write a book, so the narrator is not to be trusted.2. A rabbit could never be a vampire, for many reasons, but primarily that they don't have souls.Skip this book and read a real vampire book, like How To Cook A Vampire."
5,GOOD SERIES,MY SON HAD THIS BOOK ON HIS SUMMER READING LIST AND WAS A REALLY CUTE BOOK. TALKS ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW AND HOW YOUR IMAGINATION CAN GET CARRIED AWAY.
3,Cape and Fangs Caper!,"This cute animal fantasy is a quick and easy read, filled with plenty of dialogue and amusing family dynamics. Harold, the kind-hearted canine narrator, faithfuly relates the bizarre events following the introduction of a black and white rabbit into a family of two pre-teen boys. Book-educated Chester, the wise cat, however, is immediately suspicious of the new pet, whose name tag was written in a Carpathian dialect-uh-oh! Easy-going Harold tries to befriend the the little fellow, yet even he has to admit that plenty of odd stuff happens after dark. Are humans just slower to ""catch on"" than the four-footed world? Are the authors making not-so-subtle pleas for nutritious doggy snacks and humane bunny care? If you recall the self-analysis craze of the '70's, you'll chuckle at this spook of America's mania to get-in-touch-with-your-inner-self near the end of the book. Go, Dr. Crazy Cats! This is for kids of all ages-relax with Dracula Lite!"
5,Bunny or not?,"It was the Monroe's movie night. So when they went to the movie, one of the Monroes sat on something furry. Harold the dog is very funny. You might just belly laugh for a long time. Chester the cat tries everything he reads in his research books. Weird things start to happen in the Monroe's house, especially to their fruits and veggies. CUTE BUNNY OR EVIL VAMPIRE? Find out in BUNNICULA!!!!!!!!!!LiamArlington Heights, IL"
5,"great book, buying it for my son",This book was read to my class in forth grade. i loved it and still remember it. I remember checking out all the sequels to it and reading them too. Now I'm buying it so my son will have it. I recommend it to anyone. It's great. :)
5,Mysterious Book,"I really like Bunnicula because of the cute litte bunny and it's funny. I really think you should read it because if you like mysterious books then you will give it five stars, too. It is a good book because Chester, the cat, thinks Bunnicula, the bunny, is a vampire because he has red eyes and vampire teeth."
4,Fun book- kids love it!,"My daughters took turns reading this to me and it was a fun read for all of us. Poor little Bunnicula-turned into a vampire by the imagination of an evil cat. Almost made me like those varmints that keep eating my veggie garden! Also, my daughter chose this book for her book review for second grade and it was so much fun to dress her up as the ""Bunnicula"". My kids are 7 and 8 and love it---can read to a younger age group especially if interested in mystery or cute furry animals."
3,This is a book pretty good,"The book Bunnicula by James Howel is about a juice thirsty rabbit that is a vegetable vampire and he drinks the juice out of the fruit or vegetables and will steal your heart as well as your vegetables. He will drink their juice till they loose their color and turn white. If you see Bunnicula he will look as cuddly as any other rabbit, but looks can fool. He will take your veggies, so kids might think that it's a dream come true until you find out he likes fruits too. If you like funny strange books, this might be a book for you because, it's so good I don't even have to tell you, if you like it, then you can read it and don't forget there is a whole series of these books!"
3,Authors should revise,"In Bunnicula, the dog talks about liking CHOCOLATE cake. This might give kids the idea to feed chocolate to their dog. I'm surprised that the authors used this vehicle because chocolate is extremely toxic to dogs. One ounce of baking chocolate can kill a small dog. The authors could have used pound cake (get it?), or bundt cake or any other types of sweet dessert -- snickerdoodles for example. I hope they will revise future editions of Bunnicula."
1,This was a book?,"This story was very dull and had no meaning. If you would like to buy something interesting read C.L.U.T.Z. or the Harry Potter series, anything but this."
5,Bunnicula: The Ultimate in Escape Fiction for Children,"Deborah Howe's sense of child entertainment and enrichment is out of this world, and Bunnicula, A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery, is a monument of that sense. Reading Bunnicula is one of the fondest memories I have of the third grade--absolutely priceless. This book is a must for fun-loving, imaginative children."
5,Bunnicula,"Binnicula was about a family called the Monroes' there were Mr. Monroe, Mrs. Monroe, Pete, and Toby had went to the theater to see a movie. When Toby had sat on something. It was a bunny, so they left and took it home the Monroe's called the Bunnicula half of bunny and half of Dracula. The Monroe's also had two other pets a dog named Harold and a cat named Cheaster. As the story goes on Cheaster is thinking that Bunnicula is a vampire. Because when the Monroe's put vegetabes in the cage Bunnicula sucks the juices he does the same thing to a squash, a tomato and other vegetables. When the Monroe's find out that Bunnicula has been sucking the juices from other vegetables they him to the docter and he requires him to be fed on canned juice.My opinion about the book is that I thought the author was very creative with the story. There was very funny times in the story and I thought the author did a great job with the way he wrote the story."
5,I want to read it now,"I read this book when I was about 6 years old. Now I find myself wanting to read it again. I gave the book away years ago, but I want to buy it again. It's a fabulous and entertaining story."
5,Funny!!!!,"I really liked this book!!! it is also hilareous! It is taken from the dog's point of veiw, witch I think is very uniqe! The absolute funniest part of the book is when the cat tries to pound a steak into bunnicula's heart. This book is SO good and really funny!"
5,A tale of a vampire bunny and 2 cute animals,A great book of a bunny and 2 animals. Chester who has a hint that this bunny is a vampire because of his fangs while Harold thinks Chester has lost it. When they find out Bunniculas secret they are totally amazed. The best book I have ever read that is totally horrifying!
5,Read the book--then get the tape!,I am a student teacher in Seattle and love this book BUT... the book on tape is a must have for bedtime fun!
4,Bunnicula rocks!,"Bunnicula is a great book, and it is also an easy read for new or simplified readers."
4,Bunnicula,In Bunnicula it is a stormy night and Harold sees something white and little. He goes out there and finds a bunny with fangs. I like this because it is scary. Find out more about the book.
4,Nostaglia,Always liked Claudio Villa. Was not dissapointed in this CD enjoyed it. I have most of his albums.
5,just like old times,I can't believe I actually own this CD single again. As a teen I used to blast the acappella until my mother would tell me to turn it off. I searched youtube and track 5 was nowhere to be found on there. This is a great piece of nostalgic music for me.
2,too narrow,"My 7 Medium was very narrow and tight, but I liked the look of the shoe and had heard good things about the brand, so I kept them, but still have not been able to stretch them out. Now I wish I had returned them, because I won't wear them."
4,Taupe Clark slides,Received these quickly and they are a good addition to my wardrobe. These seem to run a little less wide since they are top stitched on the sides and the initial wearing made them a little less comfortable than my time-tested and trusted other Clarks. Hope they get more comfortable with wear because they're a great basic shoe.
2,Clarks Cumin Slide,"I love the cotton color, just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks.The show style it the most unconfortable of any Clark shoe I have have. There is something strange about the left shoe, it give me a blister everytime I wear it."
4,Clark's Cumin,"These shoes are great, as are most Clark's shoes. They have good arch support, cushy soles, and good looking uppers. However, they arrived looking slightly worn as if they were a floor model, or bought, gently used, and returned. I liked them enough to keep them anyway, and because I didn't want to pay more postage to return them."
2,"English-, Germanic-, Greek-centric. VERY disappointing","I bought this book expecting a dictionary which would give equivalents of various lexical items throughout the Indo-European language family, with representation from at least one language from each branch. Instead, what we have here is a book whose title SHOULD have been ""Dictionary of English word equivalents in Germanic and Greek"". About 95% of the ""Indo-European"" explained here comes from these languages. Next in frequency is Latin.There are only a handful of references to Celtic, Sanskrit and Russian (only very basic and obvious correlations for the latter), plus only one Iranian word I could find. Armenian? Albanian? Tocharian? Baltic? Anatolian languages? Hah, forget it!This book can only be recommended to those people interested in English or Germanic word origins, rather than those interested in a truly balanced overview of Indo-European. For everything else it is totally inadequate."
2,same old same old,"This booklet is merely a reprint of the appendix found at the back of the American Heritage Dictionary. I already have the dictionary -- so, had I known that this booklet contained nothing new, I would not have purchased it!"
3,very good but....,"A superb reference for the scholarly etymologist and any serious student of European languages, but certainly not an especially valuable reference for the average reader. Still, I find it useful every once in a while when I wish to research the origins of a particularly curious or esoteric word.So, this one is an excellent buy for some and a dubious buy for many others. =)"
1,Very difficult to follow,"I've tried this video several times, but I can't seem to follow along in certain sections. I agree with some of the other reviewers who say you need a dance background. I find it really hard to follow the dance moves - maybe I'm not very coordinated, but it's frustrating. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you can learn new dance moves quickly or are extremely coordinated."
1,Trashed It,"I've read just about all of the O'Neal Gear books and I just could not stomach this one. I tried twice to read this book and finally just threw it in the trash. The content was just too much. I found it repulsive. Most of their books I enjoy, some were tedious to read but for the most part entertaining and interesting."
3,needs some updating,"This book is 16 years old and needs some updating but it also contains a large amount of valid and valuable stuff. It is interesting to compare it with newer books about dinosaurs and see how much more we know about our reptilian predecessors than in 1984. Dino fans, give this one a chance!"
2,UGHHH!,"This book is good for one so out of date. However, it mentions two pioneers in the field of paleontology (Joseph Leidy, E.D. Cope), yet does not mention the fact that they worked for The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The first dino skeleton ever displayed by Leidy (hadrosuarus foulkii) was displayed at the Academy. It is a sad day when you dicuss the history of paleontology yet neglect to mention the Academy."
2,Good but not as good as his two earlier recordings,"Contra la corriente is a good CD but most of the songs are too slow and lacking the salsa flavor of his two earlier recording ""Todo a su tiempo"" ""A Otra Nota"". If you are looking for Salsa for dancing from the heart go with ""Todo a su tiempo"" if you are a fan of ballads and are not into salsa dancing then ""contra la corriente"" may be a better choice for you."
5,contranatural,i think that marc anthony is the bomb and my favorite song is hubo alguien ..even though the whole album is buttas. marc anthony grew up en el barrio and my brothers tell me about him all the time.. keep it up guy.. i think every one will enjoy contra la corriente!
5,THEE BEST. NO ONE CAN SING LIKE THAT.,"MARC ANTHONY IS THE #1 SALSERO. HE CAN SING, ENGLISH /SPANISH, HE CAN SING SLOW OR FAST, WHAT EVER COMES OUT OF THIS SOULFUL BORICUA IS DEFINITLY MEANINGFUL, POWERFUL, & 100% ORIGINAL. HE IS MY FAVORITE. I LISTEN TO HIM EVERYDAY ALL DAY , & THAT'S THE TRUTH. I COULD NEVER GET TIRED OF THAT GOD BLESSED VOICE. ALL HIS ALBUMS ARE WONDERFUL. EVERY SONG HE SINGS IS ...UNEXPLAINABLE, THIS MAN IS MAGNIFICIENT. WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS HOW MUCH I LOVE HIS MUSIC. ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE VERY GOOD. THERE'S A SONG FOR EVERY OCCASION. LISTEN TO ""Y HUBO ALGUIEN"" ""ME VOY A REGALAR"" ARE GOOD WHEN YOUR STARTING FRESH AND NEW. THE LIST GO ON , BUT THEY ARE ALL GREAT. FROM ONE NEW YORIQUEN TO ANOTHER, SIGUE DANDOLE SALSA Y SABOR."
5,Especial y creativo!!!,A mi me encanta este CD! Es bien hecho y contiene tal sentimiento. Es cierto que se puede bailar facilmente con esta musica porque Marc Anthony emplea los elementos hermosos de Salsa como nadie.
5,marc anthony has the most romantic voice!!!,EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MAN IS WONDERFUL...INCLUDING HIS MUSIC!!!
5,I love that guy!,"I have all his cd they are great! he has a very sexy voice, and he drives me nuts! since i was little i like him and i still do. He is a great singer!"
5,"incredibly musical, comunicative musicians, lots of ""sabor""","Being very picky as far as ""salsa"" goes, I still listen to this cd every day. He has such a powerful voice, and such a presence; it is wonderful.Also, his musical arranger is amazing!! This music will definetely move you, and if you're looking for a great tropical music cd, this one is it!!Take it from me; I'm a musician; I know what I'm talking about!!!"
5,Makes me want to samba away from my cubicle!!,"I just took a chance on this CD, after noticing that Marc Anthony was referred to in every review I encountered (various media) of Ricky Martin's first CD in English. (Sorry, have yet to hear Ricky.) This is an ecstatic CD, full of the passion and personal voice I associate with classic salsa (like my heroine, Celia Cruz). Rich orchestrations, emphatic backing vocals, lovely text (even with my Spanish dictionary). Enjoy!"
4,His Best Salsa Album,"Great songs, great voice. I don't think I'll will ever hear Marc make a full salsa album, without any of the pop or ballads. The style of music that in his albums are ideally not danceable, basically because the louder and more aggressive arrangements will take away from his voice. That is one major difference between him and other salseros like Victor Manuelle, Tito Rojas, etc.; they don't necessarily have the same range as Marc, but the orchestra doesn't become as a distant background. His records are to be listened to relax."
3,disappointing read,Ihad no difficulty in putting this book down . I was very disappointed I usual enjoy Patricks books not up to his usual standards.
5,Circles in the Stream By Shelly Roberts Avalon Web of Magic,This is the best book ever!I love books about magic and frendship and this fits both dipartments. I think this is a wonderful book because it is funny and imagintive. I think it's a fun book. I think all girls should read it.
4,Making epidemiology come alive,"I work in the field, on development and health, and this book shows the reality behind epidemics and their control. All the politics, the wrangling, all the non-medical stuff.These guys seem to have access to the top people in the field and probably have lots of inside connections. Brookes sends post-SARS dispatches from the right places, even the famous Metropole, Hotel M! Why has no one else written or picked up on this story? Every american and european should read this if only to understand the larger world they live in.Good job Brookes and Khan for making epi and public health come alive in a realistic way. And good on the WHO for stopping SARS and telling the story"
5,Much more than your usual collection of quotes,"A Simple Monk presents Robert Thurman's gathering of writings on the Dalai Lama, presenting such writings and reflections in a new visual biography which adds full-color images by photojournalist Alison Wright. The result is much more than your usual collection of quotes: a fine, rich gift edition."
2,The Architecture of Exile,"It is weird!!!!!!!!! It is too heavy ....... the writer talks a lot and most of the time dosent know whats he is talking about........it looks at western architecture with a philosophical and artistic point of view....... not for relaxing as it needs a lot of attention!!!!!!!!!!1 you will like it only if you like read vague stuff like connection between architecture and Adam & Eve, architecture and jews, plans and drawings of lots of religious monuments, and text that has no context with the visuals!!!!!!!!!! ......i dont think anybody will ever require this book!!!!!!!!!ALMOST USELESS!!!!!!!!!"
1,Gawdawful,What a tremendous score and such a horrific film. It is a nightmare...always good to hear Len Cariou and Madame Gingold
2,Could have been so much better.,"The story was different and imaginative, as previous reviewers have mentioned. But that was the only redeeming feature in this novel. The heroine was annoying and unbelievable - one second she hates this guy and on the very next page she loves him? I couldn't find any reason why any of the characters fell in love with each other, except for maybe their reported good looks. Ms. Coffman's writing was also a bit cumbersome. Examples: ""Love and eggs are best when they are fresh."" ""...she turned to watch them fly around the corner faster than boiled asparagus."" Is asparagus fast? Apparently so."
1,DRIED UP PEN REFILL,I WAS UPSET TO FIND MY REFILL FOR MY PEN THAT JUST LASTED 2 HOURS.NOT WORTH RETURNING.I WOULD SPEND MORE ON RETURNING IT THEN WHAT ITS WORTH.
3,A Place Called Peculiar,"This book is ok but I expected more content. With more research, I'm sure this book can be improved & expanded. I'm disappointed in the limited content."
1,I'm looking for all historical news about Hip hop Coultore,I'm looking historical news and the divelopment about hiphop colture in better way informations on the meaning of the rule of the WOMAN in all Africa and Africa-aMERICA.aNATHER Subject interest me much than the ather is the implication of muslimreligion in hip hop culture.
3,Nice book,"This book does have a lot of good info. However, some of the figures come directly from scientific articles and their legends can be difficult to follow. There is also information presented on certain topics that is not yet fully accepted in the scientific community. There are also a few topics that are presented in a confusing manner, which make them hard to follow unless you reread them. The copy that I got is made with high quality sturdy paper, so it should last for a really long time. Overall it is a decent book but I think that it could have been organized in a format that was easier to follow."
3,Entertaining,"Pickfords style is a little disjointed at times and stops the book from flowing. My other gripe is the book is full of typos, letters missing or sometimes whole words.The story is entertaining, but I feel it would be an average read if it was set in the real world and did not include fantastic creatures.I loved the concept of the Fractal Express which is a main feature of the book."
3,It's alright,"I bought this for my 5-year old, and it was a little older for her. We DID like the ""twist"" at the end, and how the language in the book is accurate for kids. Not the best, in my opinion, for her age, but would be GREAT for an 8+ year old kid."
1,poor quality,"Purchased this book, listed as ""Good quality"" gently used.. Arrived with torn spine, pages loose and corners worn out... Terrible quality, should have been paper recycled not sold again. Story is cute in helping a child relate to their new glasses, but would never purchase from this vendor again."
4,Dog Runner,"I received this product in a timely Manner. My Golden Retriever grew to be 100 pounds and this product was not strong enough of course to allow him to run beside my bike. He pulled me around. The idea is a good one, though for smaller dogs of course."
2,what a pain,"I didn't purchase this on the amazon website, but through a local pet suppy store. I was so excited until I actually tried to put this on my bike. To sum it up the metal parts were VERY, VERY poorly tooled. At first I thought I might have bought a defective item, so I took it back to the store. When I opened the second one I was shocked to see the same problem. The nuts were all scratched up and would barely fit over the bolts. The large nut only fit after about half a can of wd40 and A LOT of elbow grease from my boyfriend (LAME! because I am strong and shouldn't have to ask somebody to do it for me). I finally had it all attached and took my dog for a ride around the neighborhood. That part was okay. When I came home I tried to remove the pin, so I could ride my bike without the attachment. The pin would not come out! I had to take my bike apart to take this stupid thing off. Then I had to pound the pin with a mallot to remove it.Really really lame..."
1,Amazing,Amazing Tab and notation are both played in the book so we can play exactly from the album . Octavarium is the best i think . i love it !!
5,FAVORITE SESAME,"We just purchased this DVD for my daughter who is 9 mos old, I happen to think I enjoy it more than even she does! We love Sesame Street and think this is one of the most entertaining! I wish STOMP would come back to make another DVD for us !"
2,not what i thought,"i assumed (silly me) that this would be a composit of the OLD music from the original productions from the late 1970's to early 1980's. my granddaughter was totally bored, and so were the rest of us. apparently, this is the ""upgraded"" version. don't bother to buy if you remember the originals."
5,"Kids love it, I STILL do even now that they're too old for it!","I bought this years ago for my kids when they were Elmo-crazy. They're past that phase now but I can't seem to part with my VHS copy. I know, that's crazy right? But it is one of my all time favorite (little) kids movies. If you like rhythmic music this one will entertain YOU as well as your kids. The STOMP performers are excellent and the tunes are very catchy.My niece is now Elmo-obsessed but I can't seem to part with my copy so I'm on amazon buying one for her. Guess you could say that's the definition of this being ""a keeper!"""
2,"Cute, but flimsy","The money shirt is kind of cute, but very flimsy. It doesn't stay together well. And it's a lot smaller than I expected. Still, the recipients got kind of a kick out of it."
2,Cute idea,Cute idea but didn't stay together very well. I used some tape to hold areas of it together. I also thought it would be a little bigger then it actually was.
5,One of the best punk rock albums ever!,"This record is amazing1 It's a very good pick for anyone who enjoys punk rock. I would say this is there best cd, welfare porblems was good, but this one definately tops it off. The exorcist song was hillarious and I loved ever minute of it. I advise you to check it out as soon as you can!!!"
5,AWESOME!!! It sure is really hot in here!!,"This book is awesome you won't be able to put it down if you try. Everything you wanted to learn about 98 is in here. Jeff.... must i say anymore? Just check out the book and you'll see why. I'm a fan of 98 and this book just reaffirms what i know... that these guys are awesome performers and as well as handsome, gorgeous men. If you haven't picked up your copy yet, what are you waiting for? =)"
3,very funny!,loved seeing robby and bud cort playing off of each other. lots of funny sight gags if you pay attention closely. i saw this when i was a little kid and i enjoyed seeing it again after all of these years.
1,Waste of time and money,"I agree with the guy who thinks version 8 should be closer to bug-free than version 5. I know DOS well enough to get around the problems that can be addressed on that level, but there are programming problems beyond DOS that are Greek to me. I also agree that customer support is non-existant.Lucky for me I purchased the upgrade and therefore didn't throw away as much moeny as I might have otherwise."
1,Buggy and unstable,"The program was able to recognize a Linux installation on a second hard drive but unable to boot it. Then it suddenly began to start up with an update error window stating ""Invalid registry key"". And it wont't update or install again. I had used an earlier version and had problems years ago, and ended up reintalling Windows, which I may have to do again. Be very cautious about using any product which alters the MBR of your hard drive. In addition, when I initially was offered this program since I had another product from them, they offered to give me 2 additional programs for free, but did not do so. Emails to their sales department were not answered. Given this I am not optimistic about their tech support."
5,A Pocket Full of Promises!,This book should be in everyone's briefcase so that it can be pulled out and read during the tough times to help ground and inspire. You can't stay down and out for long when you have this book by your side!
4,Typical 1980s teen romance...,"I loved this series back in the 80s, I grew up with this kind of fluff in school. To me school in the 80s was a million times better than current day.Anyway, in this book shy, Lynne Henry anonymously enters a song writing contest at school. The lead guitarist in the highschool band falls in love with the song and will do anything to find the girl who wrote the it.Long story short, Lynne breaks her silence, gets the ""guy"" and a make-over and everyone lives happily ever after.``Katrina"
4,Predictable but enjoyable 1980s romance,"This is the classic 1980s ugly-ducking-gets-her-guy predictable romance where you know exactly what is going to happen all the way through,and you know that Lynne is going to get her..Guy!!(that was his name!)All the same,it is really enjoyable and very much held my attention and interest."
3,Visually poor,"The story has enough repetitions to satisfy a young reader and an amusing ending. The writing is good but the lay-out and pictures are not. The book is for ""Just Getting Started"" readers but it lacks the clear, bold typography and illustrations children benefit from at this level. It's a book that a child who is just starting to read would glance at and put back on the shelf because it looks wordy and difficult. Julia Hoban needs an illustrator with a brighter pallette and stronger line to really complement the story."
4,A great tribute and enjoyable history lesson,"Marvin Jensen's ""Strike Swiftly"" is a great addition to any library. Jensen shows the people behind some of the great events of the Second World War. As he traces the 70th Tank Battalion from pre-WW II through the end of the war, he honors his brothers in arms, both living and dead, with solid history of events and a more solid account of the people. Inspiring and easy to read, the stories are often humorous and the reader will appreciate the fact that the U.S. Army in WW II was a citizen's army. Jensen details well small unit armor tactics and explains day to day army life. If you like military history and enjoy it from the soldiers point of view, Jensen is right on target!"
2,History not so great,"While this book is a fine human interest story it fails in certain historical accounts. The author's insistence that Americans lost the tank battle at Sidi Bou Zid due to the superiority of German tanks is absolutely false. He insists that the Germans used Panthers in the battle, which never saw action in North Africa, and the number of Tigers in the battle were quite few although he alludes to substantial forces. This book is an interesting read but questionable in terms of historical accuracy."
3,"OK, But Not His Best","Album is worth the price and worth having. Some songs are very good, nice instrumentals. Unforunantly, his album ""Romantica!"", (I give that five stars), is not available here. Fierro has a great sound but the songs on this album does not do justice to his abilities. I give it three and one-half stars. Still a fan."
4,"The ""Babbit"" of the Christian world","I've been chuckling all the way through this book. It is amazing (and a bit sad) to see how little has changed since Lewis first created this character. I've often wondered how anyone could lead the depraved life of an evangelist and still sleep nights. Given his flair for depicting turn-of-the-century middle America, Lewis paints a plausible picture.In addition to ""Elmer Gantry"", I've read ""Main Street"", ""Babbit"" and ""Arrowsmith"". Of these, my favorite remains ""Arrowsmith""."
5,Timeless and Relevent,"A scathing look evangelicals and the dirty business of old time religion. The book stays relevant and is true to the nature of religion, politics, entertainment and the gullibility of the masses."
3,Review of A Place Called Heaven Richard Sigmund,A book easy to read on Heaven. It most probably is true. The one chapter on hell is frightening. The description of Christ probably accurate. The reader will have to make up their own mind. We all face the question of eternity; read this book and you won't want to run the risk of partaking in the hell that the book describes. The reader will either think about the subject or discard - possibly at their peril.
1,Worthless rehash of online help,"I can't believe there are people with something good to say about this book. Probably friends of the author.I've been using GoLive CS2 for about 3 weeks now, and this book showed me nothing I didn't already know; that's how basic it is.His ""tips"" include wisdom such as ""That's right, hover you cursor over many of the controls in the Adobe PDF Preset dialog for a helpful description of what the option affects.""Wow!Oh, I did learn about some new features, like ""Tip 7: Managing Palettes""; how you can ""dock"" a palette along the edge of the screen. Only it doesn't work. Probably works on a Mac. Apparently he never bothered to check the tips on a Windows machine (the book cover says ""Covers GoLive CS2 fopr Windows and Macintosh"")."
4,Awsome book,"The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars was the section on photoshop...I don't have it (not yet anyway) and would've liked more genera info.Other than that this book is great! From homemade solutions to professional. Great tips, suggestions. I learned alot from this book and Story's pocket guide too.Would highly recommende this book to anyone interested in doing a little more with their camera with simple, easy to remember solutions/suggestions!"
4,Neat Little Photo Book,"Be prepared, this book has no real theme. It is a hodgepodge of interesting stuff. The photoshop section is very good, which is surprising, as that is not the focus of the book. However, I learned a good deal from that section. Some of this stuff most people will never use, but it definately gets you thinking. My favorite was using the camera as a scanner, when you don't have one handy."
4,Useful Hacks for you digital camera,"Digital Photography Hacks is a part of O'reilly's hacks series, which provide tricks and solutions for different fields. This book gives you tips and tricks when dealing with your digital camera.I read this book after reading Digital Photography Guide for the same writer, Direck. So, I found myself comparing between the two books and found the Digital Photography Hacks is an extension for the Digital Photography Guide. These tips and tricks complete your knowledge with some useful methods to create professional photos using tools and things around you.If you know your camera well, you will find this book very useful and open your mind for new tricks to produce professional photos. However, if you were a beginner in digital photography I would prefer to start with Direck's Digital Photography Guide."
4,"A home-style, family book for everyone","If you enjoy history and want a clean read that will keep you hooked cover to cover than this is the book for you! I found this children's book a fun read that would be great for adults and kids alike if they are trying to rekindle their innocent, free-spirit days as a child! It takes you from Abe's youth to his adolescent and the history of his aduldhood. What a great read!"
4,Good mystery in New England/Texas series,"This again is a continuation of her New England/Texas series and as always has the secretive leading lady(s) and the strong, pushy male. It was a good mystery but you figure early on whodunit but so what... We wanted to see it heat up. Unfortunately, I wish she would have dealt more with Kara and Sam and less of everyone else. Ms. Neggers tends to bring in more & more characters when all I really want to do it hear about all the old ones. Still, I highly recommend it and would keep it along with my favorite ""Finding You""."
3,"Pleasant, Easy Read","I did not realize Stonebrook Cottage was a part of a series. I thought the book was okay. There were parts of the book that were repetitive and thus annoying. I do like Carla Neggers style of writing, and the romance and suspense in her books. I just felt the storyline with the children and Kara this strong-minded defense attorney believing them and being pulled by everything they said, unbelievable. The chemistry between Kara and Sam was good. I guess I would have liked some closure with Sam and his dad. I felt the end was rushed. I would have preferred less annoying repetitive information throughout the book and more of a strong end."
3,Stonebrook Cottage,"I enjoyed this book, as I enjoy all Carla Neggers books. However, this rambled a bit and didn't carry the suspense her books normally do."
3,Good book,"When it comes to slander Austria almost to the point of ridiculousness, Thomas Bernhard has no peer. In this book he gives vent to his well-known hatred for the country through the character of Franz-Josef Murau, a middle-aged Austrian writer self-exiled in Rome who bears resemblance to many Bernhard's characters and ultimately to the author himself. By means of Bernhard's visceral, vertiginous prose, with touches of off-color humor and ironic resignation, Murau ruthlessly inquires into his own soul as he tries to unravel his painfully disenchanted past and come to terms with his dreary origins. A good novel by an interesting writer."
1,Shlock talk,"This book is simply bad. The writting itself is poor and the absurd ideas the story is about are simply unbelivable and silly. Why would anybody buy this book or the ideas inside? This book is good only if you've been living on a biblical ""base"" all your life. Drivel"
1,We know he wrote this one...,"Of course, we're all familiar with the fact that Mr. Larson is well known for having nothing to do with the authorship of his own books, stealing most of his ""Larson's Book of Cults"" from Walter Martin and for not authoring his violent ""Dead Air"" novel and getting sued for it..... but this book HAS to be Bob's. I read it on a lark and it's a disaster from start to finish. Bob needs to look up the word ""implausible"", which would have been a better title for this grocery check-out masterpiece."
1,Novel,"I don't read noveles,but thank you Amazon and your suppliers that it was so cheap. I would not have been happy. Bob Larson is good at his work. This does not discredit Him ,if it is his."
4,Hours of fun,"This is a great, old-school toy, and still quite fun for the iPad generation. A classic story put into 4 pages and 26 felt pieces--people, animals, pumpkins. Just FYI, the felt pieces do not adhere to the board very well, which is just the nature of the felt board. Makes it easier for toddler hands, but also makes the pieces easier to lose track of if they fall off.The one downside is that the felt characters are not cut in the right direction (when the prince is bent on one knee to give Cinderella the glass slipper, her cut-out is facing the other direction). Kind of annoying, but not a big deal for my 2 year old!"
5,Excellent!,"Incredible photographs and prosen are contained in this book. A moving, sensitive chronicle of cancer survivorship that changed my perceptions forever. I recommend it unreservedly. I can't wait until Springer's next book!"
5,For anyone that has been touched by breast cancer,"During my battle with breast cancer, this became the most important book in my struggle with my diagnosis and treatment. It was sitting quietly on a bookshelf at the chemo infusion room. What a beautiful, beautiful, uplifting, empowering book! It was hard to find during that time, but I am pleased to see that Amazon has it available now. Highly recommended to anyone who has been touched by breast cancer, personally or thru someone you love. The photographer captures the spirit of the women perfectly, and their stories are well written. It touched the depths of my soul."
2,Don't bother,The silicone case is sturdy but very slippery. I had a silicone case that came with my iRiver and it was not slippery like this. I feel very uneasy holding it in my hand and would never use this case to take my Gigabeat to the gym or outside anywhere. The screen is not protected whatsoever and the plastic belt clip is cheaply made and EXTREMELY flimsy. It came with no instructions so you need to fiddle with the parts to figure how the clip works. It turned out to be a complete waste of time because the clip is so weak and cannot support the weight of the Gigabeat. Spend your money on something more worthwhile. This was a total waste.
3,"Hey, it's Elmo, you know....if it makes your child happy...","We bought this one out of desperation for something new in the Elmo repetoire, since our little 20-month old thinks Elmo is the greatest thing since his Daddy. He loves it, but it may be one of the ones a grown-up can tolerate least. Discuesses shoes, jackets, hats...YOu have not really reach your limit with Elmo until you put up with Jacket and Jill jokes. One real complaint though...Elmo tells kids that when a jacquet is dirty, it goes into the washing machine. Try that at home with Mommy or Daddy's leather jacket!!!!So, why three stars?...four from my kid, two from me!"
3,Elmo Schmelmo,"OK OK OK, Elmo is slowly growing on me also and my daughter really likes his DVD's. This is the usual stuff. Kids will love it but it still lacks the appeal of older Sesame Street stuff."
4,A Good DVD,"I was skeptical about ordering this DVD because most of the reviews were not overwhelmingly positive. I just wanted to write that it is worth the reasonable price. Both of my children enjoy this DVD, and they have been having fun wearing their jackets, hats and shoes since they watched it. I therefore would definitely recommend this DVD."
3,Head to Toe - Unusually Boring,"I would rate this the least interesting Elmo DVD - it has a slow pace, and it's all about similar topics (clothing items). Our two year old - who loves Elmo - actually yawns during this one. The only amusing part is about shoes. Pass on this one if you have a choice!"
3,"Good DVD, just didn't seem to keep his attention",My son LOVES Elmo and when I picked this up I'd thought he'd really enjoy it because he's obsessed with HATS! He did enjoy the hat segment but didn't seem as interested in the shoes or jackets as much. I'll still go back to Wild Wild West anyday!
5,Peps live in Pasadena,"Recorded live in February 1994, this CD features Ken in a variety of musical settings, from old jazz standards (EXACTLY LIKE YOU) to boppish originals (NUTS) to the bossa nova (MENINA FLOR). As usual he alternates between clarinet and tenor sax, with his tenor playing especially fine on GHOST OF A CHANCE and THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE, this last track the highlight of the disc. A modern-styled clarinetist, he is at his Buddy DeFranco-styled best on NUTS and the Red Norvo-Tal Farlow inferno called I BRUNG YOU FINJIANS FOR YOUR ZARF. Howard Alden is on guitar offering superb support, and the rhythm section is solid. Sweets Edison guests on three selections, the best being the aforementioned BEST THINGS IN LIFE. Definitely worth checking out. (The gig is also available on video.)"
1,Book does not live up to its title,"If you are looking to learn about ""astral combat,"" there is precious little about it in this book. What little there is of it is way arrogantly and cynically written. I found it to be a really negative book. It is supposed to be about promoting ""life, health, and light,"" but man, is it negative stuff. The author is one negative unhappy dude. It's self-published too. And, this is a way tiny book, more like a pamphlet!!!!"
2,The Title was the best part of this book!!!,"Contains a lot of bad information. Highly cynical and very negative -- AND IT DOES NOT DISCLOSE HARDLY ANY METHODS OF ASTRAL COMBAT!!! If you want to learn the real deal, check [elsewhere]..."
1,the techniques of astral combat,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone; the author has a strange and disturbing view of matters. example: if you should see any kind of astral creature,you should get a physical exam immediately. Author believes that all paranormal experiences are the sign of poor health and a healthy individual would never have them. Are you kidding me? The author believes astral experiences fall into two categories: negative and/or illusionary. The author is only listed as G.Travels and says it is 'necessary' for him/her to remain anonymous. Hogwash. Use this book to line the birdcage."
4,We love it!,"We got this for our 3 1/2 year old son and our 1 year old daughter for Hanukkah this year. We knew our son would love it but our daughter was thrilled with it too - she couldn't wait to get on it. I think it's the fun colors and movement. There's plenty of room for 2 to sit on each side and the movement is very smooth. We didn't give it 5 stars because my husband was disappointed that the locking mechanism didn't actually lock it completely from rocking - it just can't go the full distance. Overall, a very nice product and it doesn't take up much footspace outside too!"
3,Seats are the weak spot,"Bought this at Academy May 2010, three months later the seat covers are already splitting. You also have to be extra careful when assembling. The main bolt that holds the seats to the frame in the center has a tendency to loosen. The instructions say not to get that bolt too tight but if you don't it loosens with every swing back and forth and will eventually come off. This being said, the kids love it."
5,Excellent,Heavy duty; well painted; very stable. This teeter totter is the best I have found. My grandchildren (3 & 5) are on it all the time with little worry. A bumper on the bottom of the seat keeps heels from being pinched. The mechanism is smooth and seats large so two can be on one side to balance a larger rider. A great price for an excellent product.
5,Good Old Fashion Fun,"This product is great. So well built. My six year old and two year old love it. Two kids can fit on each side. Not hard to put together. Thanks to this service, I remembered others saying that step two was already completed and it helped to know that."
4,Kids love it,"My 3 year old and 6 year old really enjoy themselves on this. We even had a party and their older cousins had a lot of fun on it too. My husband put it together and he said it's good quality. The problem that I have with this item is that it is not packaged very well and the pieces get banged up and dented and chipped during shipping and a piece was sticking out of the box when it arrived. The parts are too heavy for the kind of box it comes in. Also, we've only had it for 1 month and it's chipped/scraped already which will eventually rust. I have a feeling one of the kids did this and not due to the weather. Overall, I would recommend the gym dandy."
3,A good read and insight,It is what I had expected. Would recommend it as a read to both inspire teachers and those making a career choice.
2,Was it just me?,"Maybe it was just me, but when I set this up I could either (1)print or (2) access the internet. I guess I wasn't as computer saavy as I needed to be, but I didn't have the time to figure it out. The Belkin wireless print server worked fine, printing from one wireless notebook within minutes after opening the box."
1,I wish I could give 0 stars,"This is a peice of junk. Works with very few printers, and you must set up your network entirely around this, so you'll probably end up purchasing much more equipment just to get it to work."
3,DP-G310 okay but lacks best wireless security features,"I followed the instructions for setting up the DP-G310 and it worked without a hitch on my DI-624 four computer (Wi and Et) home network. All computers (Win ME and Win XP) are able to print to the HP-5650 connected to the DP-G310 via Wi or Et connection. However, there is one thing I do not like about the DP-G310 - it does not support the WPA PSK Wi security protocol. I find it disappoint that DLink's DI-624 supports WPA-PSK but their only 802.11G print server, the DP-G310 does not support it. The DP-G310 only supports WEP so if that is selected than the entire network (DI-624 and any wireless devices on the network) security must also be set to the less secure WEP setting. DLink tech support said that they didn't know if a firmware upgrade to WPA PSK would be offered or not. I would not have purchased the DP-G310 if I had know it lacked the more secure wireless feature and was not going to be firmware upgraded to WPA PSK."
1,Useless,"This print server does not work well with my Canon i860 printer. I barely got it to send print jobs (text only) from my Windows XP machine - it *won't* work from OS X. Note to OS X users - buried in the documentation (not in the marketing stuff - they claim 100% compatibility with OS X), they mention that when printing from Macintosh, this printer only supports PostScript printers. I wish I had known that to begin with, I wouldn't have bought it.Pain to setup. Poor documentation. Uselesss product."
1,Usless for Macintosh OS,"100% compatible with Mac? Hardly. There are very few printers that D-Link supports when printing from a Mac, and they have to be ""post-script"". False advertising."
2,"Dissappointed, not her best work!","I was very dissappointed with these videos!! I really like Tamilee Webb's other videos like the ""I want those"" series and her stretching videos are awesome! But not in this case. The music was so soft that you couldn't really hear it. Hard to keep moving to a beat you can not hear. She keeps sing with the songs, which isn't that big a deal because I would have sung along too if I could have heard the music. But, all I could hear was hear sing. I wasn't playing this on a small TV system either. Big screen with surround sound. She moves from one step to the next quickly. I found it hard to keep up with which step I was suppose to do. I just wasn't inspired or motivated to finish the tape or do it again."
4,mom of two small boys,"I am not an aerobics instructor I am a busy busy busy mom of two small busy busy busy boys.I found the first dvd (haven't tried the second) refreshing and definately a work-out for the lower body. You should probably know that I haven't worked out for quite a while so I did sweat, I am definately looking forward to tomorrow and dvd no. 2 . Seems like you could really get in to it or take it easy whatever your level of fitness is.Yes, she does sing a little but so will you the music is hoppin and makes you want to sing and dance.Thanks for such a fun product."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"OK, I will start by saying that I have purchased EVER exercise tape in the entire world and this is the ONLY tape that is ACTUALLY FUN. I purchased the DVD set of Fit to the Hits and the most wonderful thing about the DVD set is the option to just hear the music and not listen to the instructor. I love the music, and the dance steps are really easy. I get the same workout in 30 minutes, as I do working out to Richard for almost an hour. (Don't get me wrong I like Richard, but less time same workout). If you are someone who loves to dance and has a short attention span or not much time in the day, this is a really great tape to buy."
2,Thought it was DVD,I guess I made a mistake when I bought this but I've looked everywhere on the descriptions to see if it said it was a VHS set and it didn't. I don't have a VCR so this was a problem. Oh well...Life goes on.
3,Did not enjoy these 2 dvds at all,"Tamilee Webb is one of my favorite instructor, and I am a great fan of her series ""I want those.."", but these dvds were a disappointment for me. Did not like the music that was played, maybe that was the reason why. Sure, some fun moves like the drums & guitars, but I wouldnt play it again. Selling these series to someone who will appreciate them.."
3,Not her best,"Like many others, I am a Tamilee Webb addict and have many of her video's which I love, but this set just doesn't cut the mustard. She assumes you know the steps and doesn't take time to really walk you through them. I am in shape and did not get anything out of it, course I could barely follow so... and, yes, you can barely hear the music that she occasionally sings too. I suppose once you've done the tape a dozen times you might get the moves but good luck. For dancing to the grooves I find the MTV Grind much better."
1,Chintzy,We were disappointed with the quality of the ergonomic rake. We purchased it as a gift but didn't give it as it appears cheaply made.
4,this CD is really tight for people who like trying new shit,"I bought this CD just for the hell of it, and I ended up really likin it. They need to get signed up with another label and get some new,fresh beats. They have a lot of potential."
1,boody,"please change your name,you probably will have to soon anyway!...the real TECHN9NE is from k.c."
1,Tek9 representing the real Tek9 from K.C.,"You do need to change your name cause the real name and the origanal is Tek9 from Kansas City, Missouri. Say his name 5 times Tek Tek Tek Tek Tek9. That's what I am talking about. Representing Missouri. The show me state, show me what you bout.You don't know nothing about K.C. what. And I give my shots out to Tek9, Luni C.,Young Fury,S2theB, Court Dog, Devious, Vell Barkardy,Young Meek, silas aka Smigg Dirty, MLT, don't forget ya all know High Performance. Oh and Cash Click Affilliates can't forget about them, my homies. Lil Dave,JT,J-Loc and Boogz.Love ya all. One-Love.Hallar"
3,Just like any other,"If you have a higher end camera, purchase a high end CF card; if not, just purchase the best deal in town. I am a fan of the Kingston line as it is a consistent performer."
1,Not worth it,"Soles and stitching wore out after 2 months of use. Buy something else, don't waste your money on these."
2,Not Quite Ready For Prime Time,"I bought a pair of these on May 10, 2011 from Amazon, I loved the looks, still do. Unfortunately I looked at the soles a few days ago and found that both shoes had cracks in the soles that extended all of the way through. I am tough on moccasins and wear them outside occasionally, but the degree of wear which I have seen on the soles in 4 months and the cracks are far beyond what I've ever seen in this short of a time. I usually wear the real cheap Wal-Mart moccasins and they hold up for at least a year under the same service. I finally bit the bullet and ordered a pair of Rockports. it will be interesting to see how long they hold up."
5,Deserves more than a 3* rating!,"As a tribute album to Reinhardt & Grapelli (Hot Club of France, 1930s) + some harmonica (remembering Toots Thielemans), this recording is a superb effort; I've seen Byrd, Grapelli, & Thielemans perform, and also own many CDs of these various jazz artists; the music on this disc is well done & harks back to these previous eras (much of my jazz collection pre-dates the 60s & 70s, so I enjoy this style). The combination of guitar, violin, & harmonica works out quite well here - this is certainly worth a listen (and a purchase) if you enjoy these historic performers. And by all means, ignore that 3* rating. :-) P.S. Only 4 of the 15 selections are Byrd originals."
4,The writing is fogetable but the art is amazing,"This book really showcases the beautiful artwork of Ralph McQuarrie, who helped establish the look of the Star Wars films way back at the dawn of the story as we know it. In this book we see fascinating early visual drafts of things that we would later see in the movies. Most of it was impossibly fantastic to ever get filmed at the time but maybe we'll see some of it in the next two movies.The chapters on Alderan and Bespin are particular fascinating and beautiful."
3,Over Priced,"While I couldn't say I didn't like this book, I can't see how they justify the (List) price. Ok if your an art freak, but even though I'm a big Star Wars fan, it's lack of content means I could live without it."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?????,"What happened to this book? It is a disgrace to the star wars universe. It's practically a Star Wars dictionary, that's all. In spite of the good pictures, this book was very disappointing!!!!"
2,terrible,Out of all the Star Wars books i've read this was the worst one. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is becase of the art work. I you really want a book on the universe check out The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons.
4,Just making a correction,"[A] review of this cd says that ""Wild Child"" Alexi Laiho is on this cd, no he is not. As much as this cd rules, it is not Laiho...just a similar vocalist. Anyways, this release is fantastic, obviously it can be compared to Children Of Bodom, musically I think they equal the playing of Children Of Bodom but they have their own distinct sound that makes them their own band. Best tracks off this cd, well...they're all good, I like the first 4 the best, but buy it and make your own mind up."
5,SPINFLEX ratchet,"Even at the price I paid for this ratchet it is a good deal however I just bought a pair (3/8 & 1/4) for about half the price. When the one I bought on line gets here I will still appreciate having it.Proto tools are very well made tools, I would much rather have these than Craftsman tools."
1,mediocre tunes at best - very disappointed,Not much to say - seller was great - got my CD in no time - but the tunes are lacking... not worth the money.
1,"Never received order, terrible customer service","I have ordered from Hope's before with no problem. But when my web order dissapeared from their system, I received terrible customer service trying to figure out what happened. After a frustrating phone call to their 1800 number, I then emailed them my problem, a missing order. Instead of wanting to fix the problem, they blamed me for not giving them enough information, and then yelled at me in all caps, saying that my problem was an isolated incident, the whole time doing nothing to solve the issue. I have never been treated so poorly by a company before."
5,How cool is this book? It rocks!,"Being one who can be distracted by jingling shiny keys, I've gotta say that ""self-help"" books bore me and I've never finished a single one. Not so with ""Dyke Drama"". I devoured it.Just like the synopsis says, it covers Sappho to the ""L"" Word. Sure I was quoted in it (and can't help but be a little biased), but I wouldn't allow myself to be quoted in a book unless I thought it was pretty dang funny, and it is. Straights, gays, anyone, I have a message: Leslie Lange's a good gal, and her book's worth reading. It'll crack you up. Enjoy."
4,"funny, realistic","Having been in the middle of dyke drama myself, I purchased this book for some clarity. Although it didn't tell me too much more that I already didn't know, it did show me that I wasn't the only one with a manipulative ex who was the cause of 90% of the drama in my life. So, the book sheds some light for lesbians, bisexuals, and straight peaople who may have friends going through dyke drama. Or you can just read it to laugh at us poor unfortunate souls dealing with it? In which case you're probably the dyke dishing out the drama...rude! ;)"
3,Not just Strawberry flavor,"Even though the product description says this is strawberry flavor, it is really a strawberry banana flavor. I had to send it back as the grandson I purchased it for dislikes Banana."
4,This Really Pisses Me Off...,"Although the printed label on disc 4 of this collection SAYS 'La Edad De Oro Del Pop Español', the audio tracks are ACTUALLY some nonsense called 'Electro Boogie' by Aux 88. WTF??? Giving it 4 stars for the content on discs 1, 2, 3 & 5."
2,Dont Buy!!!!,"this game is really bad. i bought it and i cant get past the first level. the hornets get verrry annoying after a while, there is no targeting system to shoot with, you sometimes cant see yourself, the graphics arent the best in the world, and the idea is totally different from what i thought it would be, so unless you want to lose money, dont buy this game!!!!"
1,Buzz Lightyear of Star Command,"I ordered this game for my grandson on 12/17/02.I still have not received it and the seller has not answered my inquiries. It was suppose to be here by the 24th of Dec. and it is now the 28th.I am not very happy about this. My daughter and my grandchildren went back home yesterday. Now, if the game ever comes,I will have to ship it to him,so more shipping fees. As far as rating this game, of course ,that's impossible.Thanks,Tyne Dickie"
2,Rent before you buy.,"This was the worst game that i ever played. If you think it's going to be a continuation from TOY STORY 2, IT'S NOT! First of all it's more like a race car game than an adventure game. I bought this game for my seven year old son, and he is a buzz lightyear fan, but he can't stand this game. You have to collect all these items to advance to the next level, and that was fun, but even when he collected all of the medals the game still would'nt let him advance. I thought maybe he was missing something, so I gave it a shot,and I could'nt get past the fourth level. I collected every coin and beat the big boss at the end of every level and the game still would'nt advance me. what fun is that??"
3,Better after some time,"MacEwan deals mainly with global debt in terms of Central and South America in the 80's. Although he has valid complaints about classical and heterodox solutions to global debt his solutions are short sighted themselves. Also in looking at the United States role in global debt solution, he fails to mention Communism or the role of Cuba and the Soviet Union and the very nature of Cold War politics in the region.That being said though, it is interesting to see how many of the issues of foreign debt are playing out again in Europe. There is a very real discussion that needs to be had about the nature of liberal democracies and NGO's like the World Bank and IMF.This book may not have the answers, but it adds to the discussion."
5,Doug's Music Updates,Up close & well put together DVD.John's (JJ's) insights and personalaccounts where very well documented.A must see ... The music is Great..
5,J.J. Cale is The Best!,"This is a finely crafted work of art that sheds light on the J. J. Cale story, told by the Man himself as well as the other, fine musicians in his band. It should be seen by everyone who is truly interested in the best American music ever made. J. J. Cale's legendary status is richly deserved."
5,To Tulsa and Back-On Tour with J.J. Cale,This is a great biographically made video about J.J. Cale! Interview and concert footage is great! if your interested in Cale then this is a must. Loved it!
2,A DASH OF UNIVERSAL... A CUP OF WAR PROPAGANDA... AND A PINCH OF H.G. WELLS!,"Here we have yet another installment in the 'Invisible Man' series. This one coming between 'The Invisible Woman' and 'The Invisible Man's Revenge'. This film is interesting if your interested in the history of films and especially films made during World War II. The Propaganda is heavy and laughable in this strange but watch-able film. Like all the 'Invisible Man' movies, it's loosely tied to the other films in the series but, you don't have to watch them in any order or all of them to follow the story line of any one of them. The great cast includes Cedric Hardwicke, Peter Lorre, Jon Hall and Ilona Massey. Look closely to see Keye Luke from the Kung Fu TV show as the Japanese surgeon. This is available on DVD on the 'Invisible Man' Legacy Collection along with all four of the other Invisible Man movies from Universal. The DVD transfers are very good and there are some very good extras on the set."
5,GREAT Tamper,This tamper is not only comfortable to use it's also a perfect fit and great looking. You will not regret purchasing this tamper.
5,A Book Important To Our Generation,"What D. A. Powell has expressed in his book, Tea, is an anthem to the feelings and fears of every queer born in the sixties: that we have been both blessed and cheated for being who we are - at the time that we are - though often, distinguishing what is blessing and what is damnation is at the core of our struggle. His style is unique and challenging, as are our lives. And the mixture of tone is as complex as the various masks that we don: saint, sinner, perpetrator or innocent bystander. The range of expression is wide yet completely familiar. This book shall be a classroom text standard for the next generation who should want to understand the complexities of our collective experience."
3,Would of been great if only...,"I bought these bottles to store essential oils but there is a slight problem... it works great for liquidy oils such as tea tree but if your storing thicker oils such as Vit E, Almond, lavander oils it won't drip out of the dropper. The holes too tiny. So I had to take it off and just use as is. But great storage and the size is practicle to transport around in small cosmetic bags. Just be warned about the eurodroppers. Otherwise, would have given it a 5 stars."
3,Night Gallery series pilot,"This has been out of print for a while, but with Columbia House bringing the series out on tape, hopefully it will be available again soon. The pilot consists of three stories. If the second of the three wasn't so lame, this tape would get a four star rating. The casting is excellent, with many well-known actors taking on roles that are less than flattering. Rod Serling acts as the suave host, and of course, writer of all three tales. The first is a neat ghost story in the EC comics tradition. The second a fable in the best Twilight Zone tradition. And the third story is a tale of revenge, with an Ex-Nazi getting his just desserts. He's played somewhat sympathetically but it is hard to feel sorry for him! For those of you who didn't see this in 1969, try to catch it on a cable rerun somewhere, or write Universal Studios to try to get it rereleased."
2,"Great brand, but Stick with black!","These people make the best dryers around. The problem I have, is that the paint they use rubs off with use. They look horrible after a few months. Buy the black ones, they are awesome!"
2,Great power but too much weight,"This is a wonderful hair dryer for someone who can bench about 150 lbs. It is very sturdy and is a quick drying machine which helps reduce the frizziness factor. However, it is too heavy to operate easily. The red is fun if you need a splash of color for the bathroom. Otherwise I would recommend another Turbo Power machine which weighs less. By the way I do practice yoga and do some weight lifting so I am not a wimp."
4,Not the stereotypical female detective,"I enjoyed the three Bast mysteries I've read and wish there were more. The author isn't the greatest mystery writer (that honor goes to Robert Barnard) but the book is interesting to the last page. In fact,it was so interesting it kept my mind off the fact that I was reading it in a small airplane flying in the dark over some pretty high mountains."
2,I RANDOMLY FOUND THIS MOVIE WHILE SURFING AND IT WAS PRETTY WELL REVIEWED SO I GOT IT,"WHAT A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. I REALLY, REALLY LIKE ERIC STOLTZ and BILLY BOB THORNTON and JOHN CORBETT is GOOD. The STORY LINE SHOULD/COULD have been GOOD, but WASN'T (Thornton is one of the writers). The ACTING SHOULD have been GOOD, but WASN'T. It was TERRIBLE. I wanted to like this movie , but CAN'T. I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE GOOD REVIEWS. If you want to see these actors REALLY act, get these movies. Eric Stoltz in KILLING ZOE and Billy Bob Thornton in BAD SANTA or A SIMPLE PLAN. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY BAD."
4,My 3 year old even did it!,"I took the camera out of the box, installed the software, reviewed the quickstart guide, took a bunch of pictures, and checked them out on my Mac, all within about 10 minutes. I didn't want to spend a ton of money yet got pictures fast, my 3 year old even took some pics too, she had a riot though she's got to work on her composition some! Listen, this is a great starter camera for people that want to send digital photos to friends and relatives worldwide."
2,I've seen better,"I'm on my first day using this camera. The software would not connect to the camera to download anything, so I ended up taking a link from the Ixla website to get the twain driver for the camera before I could do much. For outdoor photography, the camera is fairly decent. For indoor photography...the camera would be better off not even having a flash. Or at least that is my experience trying to take pictures for a bowling team. Blur and dead black pictures...and this is with the flash set to ""always on."" I'd say look for another camera...or if you're an outdoorsman...then this might do for you."
2,Overall a difficult operation...,This camera is okay...nothing to brag about. The camera interface is clunky. The software is not very good. I guess for the price the whole package is okay. But I'm returning mine and will spend the extra 150.00 for something much better.
5,good tool,I'm an electrician working downtown in a steal frame new construction building and have to punch many holes and this does the trick. Great for the middle being longer to note its at a 7/8 hole that is perfect for out MC connectors we use.
5,"great for 3/4"" conduit","I purchased this bit to increase the 1/2"" hole in junction boxes to 3/4"". It worked beautifuly and never caught like other bits. I paid almost $45 for mine. Amazon has a great price on this product."
5,THA BEST EVER,"if you dont have this one, you have to get it!!! its a classic underground hit from CMR. With such songs as pimin aint ez and gone but not forgotten, its off da hook!! you can play this cd in any project round tha dirty dirty(New orleans for all of you who aint familiar with it) and the whole builiding will jump up! The lyrics are funny as hell.... ..."
5,I love the bellytwins!,"Veena and Neena are at it again! More beautiful than ever, they provide a wonderful workout that's easy to follow and fun to do! Highly reccomended!"
4,Fun/relaxed bellydance practice & routine w/veils,"I got this in 2002 which was one of the first with great production quality. Neena & Veena still have more personality & friendlier & have great humor then almost all belly dance dvds. They make you feel relaxed & enjoy dancing & you have a little fun w/their voice over humor. A lot of other ones are very serious about perfecting & doing it right, while Neena & Veena use great analogies & go slow the first couple of times & then normal speed so you can feel it in your body better.I liked the pace better & more repetition in their Belly dance Fitness for Beginners, but that does not have a routine like this one.You can see previews of this dvd & their other ones atcollagevideo comyoutube under the titles of their dvds, ""belly dance twins"" or ""Neena & Veena"""
3,Beating the Blues,"Although this is the name and author of the book I thought I was ordering, the book is different than I thought it to be. I was under the impression that there would be nice illustrations, but there are none. There are good things in the book, but it is not inviting like I thought it would be so that did not help to beat the blues."
5,Can't Believe The Quality For The Price,"Okay, so who's heard of Nunavut? I can easily picture this nicely colored, very well made flag flying over pround Nunavut residences and businesses. I was looking to fly a colorful knock off flag from some babana republic in my room to bring in some color. I was pleasantly surprised that this flag normally flies much farther north over a new province we should all be lucky enough to visit one day. Great flag, great place, great deal."
4,New 3x5 Canadian Territory of Nunavut Flag Canada Flags,The flag has good quality for the three dollar price. It looks like it may last two to three months on the pole. I would recommend it to a friend.
4,The King Describes His Kingdom,"This book was enjoyable and helpful in my study of the Kingdom of God/Heaven. The author has given a readable, concise treatise on this important subject, using the parables of Jesus found in the Book of Matthew. His writing is without theological jargon or involved propositions that are too difficult for the lay person to grasp. It is a great commentary, serving to clarify and confirm some things for me, with regard to what I believe about God's Kingdom and what I am to be doing as I live in it today."
2,way too difficult,"all the books by preston J. Blair are way too difficultfor a beginner. I have been in art school for years and Ireally had a hard time drawing his figures, he beginswith complicated animals that the only most experiencedartist might be able to copy. Try Mark Kistler's books."
3,"Decent work of fiction,worth reading","I am also one of the many direct descendants of Jenny and Thomas Wiley. I liked this book as fiction but not as a true history since it has more than one inaccuracy. Two of the most noticeable are Jenny's missing dream and the glossing over the violence of the very violent murder of her brother and five children. Both the dream and the murders are documented and are integral to her story. The removed and ""softened"" account of parts of her story damages this books historical accuracy.It may be hard to accept the painful and horrific things that have happened but if we soften or gloss over history just to make it more palatable, we change history. If a reader simply wants to acquaint his or herself with the story of this brave and resourceful pioneer woman, this book is a good place to start. If they are looking for a strictly historical account, look elsewhere."
3,Read the Product Description Carefully,"We bought this to help with the move of my daughter's college ""stuff"" back home. We thought we were buying the 660 lb cart and were surprised when we received the item. We don't have time to return it and wait for the 660 to come in stock. The product description was what tripped us up...they list BOTH models in the same description...deceptive. The model PH150 carries up to 330 lbs..the PH300 holds up to 660 lbs. It seems sturdy enough and will do the trick...just a few more trips up and down the elevators...which is what we were hoping to avoid. Lessons learned."
3,no fanny pack strap :(,"I just received this bag and it does look like the one in the picture, however, there is no fanny pack strap. The strap that clips on is definitely not a fanny pack and you can't keep anything in it. It is just a normal strap like on most bags. I don't know why it was advertised as a fanny back strap because that is not what I got. I actually bought it specifically for the fanny pack strap. Very disappointed at this false marketing :( The material the bag is made of is flimsy and it has a weird double zipper for which I can't really see the point. Not a sturdy bag and I can't see it lasting long. It does however, hold all my TKD gear and appears roomier than it looks."
2,Where's the DVD!,I bought this item with the understanding that there was a workout DVD included. Although the product is made well I would have purchased a different one that included a DVD.
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the other reviews presented here: this book is lousy. And at just over $60, it's pretty darn expensive, too.""Ethical Hacking"" is really just a hotch-potch of descriptions of tools that can be found anywhere on the Net. The English is so anguished as to be scarcely recognizable in places - almost as if it's been translated into Lithuanian by Google, and then back into English again. The peculiar typesetting makes it even more difficult to read.I just gave up trying to read this book. My advice is not to waste your money in the first place."
1,Reader From Italy,"The EC-Council has a great CUT and Paste method of publishing a book, they don't even list the Author. The tools are old and outdated, and grammar, Well what grammar? How do they certify Ethics? Waste of $75-00."
1,Poor Grammar and No Point Structure,"Do they anything that is less than 1 star?Like most reviewer that given their comments, here is my comment about the 'course Material'. I am not a native english speaker but I could still identify poor sentence and grammer construction and it could not related the points clearly.For example in the chapter on evading intrudion detection system. 'Fragrouter evade detection by Network Identication Intrusion'...What are they trying to say?Use this material just as a guide, read and find out more from better security books. Your examination will use around 20 to 30% of material other than that forget it."
1,Not as good as you might think!!,"The EC Council has produced a great book!! Well, it doesn't fall apart like some. It's such a shame that the content doesn't match the manufaturing quality.I have some experience in IT security and I was shocked to discover that some people are still teaching the 'Ping of death'!!!!! That hasn't worked for years. The modules they have structured the book on are not organized and too disparate!I was really disappointed with the book. I'm going to have to buy another book, a better book.Such a shame."
2,Cashing in,"It seems to me that the 'EC-Council' are simply trying to cash in on their exam by publishing this book. The testing tools and information is outdated in a lot of places, and the fact that the book is poorly written does not help things.I recently read and reviewed Network Security Assessment by O'Reilly, which is far more useful as a pentest guide and reference."
5,This course material really armors you with knowledge,"Well the book is a real kill. There are some technical terms which do not sync with the grammar, but thats ok. When you buy a high end technical book you cannot expect dramatics here!!EC Council's book has a exhaustive list of tools and are neatly explained. This book coupled with the Intensive classroom training of EC Council really helps in clearing the exam. I would not recommend this book for buyers who simply buy techy books for stocking their library. You need to attend their training which i think is world class. I was one of the fortunate who could find their training centre near my home town.cheers again"
1,Horrible! Whoever called her the greatest?,"Yes, unique, 20 years ago. Now she looks like a used up groupie, the videos have zero creativity, and her music is lacking any real soul. How old is she now? 50? Then I give her credit for the speed at her age. She sucks otherwise.Greatest eh? Where, in a back alley of nyc? Thats right, I forgot she has all those lame, losers she keeps around to feed her ego. Lol her fan base!"
1,not worth the money,Don't waste your money. The music- if you can call it that- sounds like a bunch of senseless noise. The short videos are a joke. I was very disappointed.
2,Fischer-Dieskau. Yuck.,"Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau shamelessly attempts to steal Act 1 as Fritz Kothner. Why did he never play the character for which he was properly suited by voice-type and personality? Beckmesser.Despite the overall badness, this is not completely without merit. Josef Greindl is very nice as Pogner, as always. Also as always, Karl Schmitt-Walter is excellent at Beckmesser. Both are better elsewhere.It's funny. I recently got hold of a Bayreuth 1957 because Gustav Neidlinger plays Sachs and Clutyens conducted it beautifully. He must have had an off night."
2,While a good live performance parts of the recording are bad,"Over 95% of the recording is good for a live performance, however, portions of the recording are quite unacceptable due to technical problems. This seriously detracts from the overall performance. The album does not include a libretto. It does have a summary and notice of which tracks have recording problems."
4,Worked...,"I used it for awhile, but if you want to best results, use facial products and start in the winter. All of my facial products work 10 times better in colder atmospheres. Ultra-Glow did what it needed to do and then it stopped. I also used Black n' White Bleacher at the same timeBLACK & WHITE BLEACH CREAM. Worked well. People say I look a lot lighter, and my blemishes have gone."
4,Standard Methods Is A Required Reference,"This revised reference assists in the sampling and analysis of water and wastewater for both the regulator and analytical lab. Sampling protocol, holding times, and various requirements of sampling wastewater are provided."
5,AWESOME!,"Bemelmans grandson has done an outstanding job of putting together a comprehensive collection of his grandfather's works. The book includes a review of his adult and children's books, his artwork, and magazine covers, as well as a collection of never before seen photographs. It is colorful, fun, and interesting. If you are a Bemelmans fan you will love this book; if you are not, this is a great way to get started!"
5,This was a real joy to read!,"As a great admirer of Bemelmans Madeline series,this book gave me insight to its creator. It is a beautiful book, well written and designed. A great tribute to a wonderful artist and writer. Truly a book that a Madeline fan would want!"
3,"Wanted to Like It, but Ultimately Not Interesting Enough","I know this film Europa (also known as Zentropa) is supposed to be great, but ultimately, I just found it quite uninteresting. I thought Lars Von Trier's ""Breaking The Waves"" was quite brilliant, but Europa was a little too meandering and unfocused to keep my attention.I do give the director some credit for at least avoiding the usual film-making cliches, but I got the feeling he doesn't really care about the audience, either - it's like he made this movie just to please himself, but forgot to ask if his guests (we the audience) were having a good time."
3,Going Hell World,"Probably, von Trier ought in oncoming epochs to be epitomized in cinematographic notebooks with his works' most distinct feature-to-remember of mixing the reality with some psychotic mysticism in a bowl of a local landscape incorporated -not telling more- eroticism-on-all-tastes-and-preferences.To a viewer not acquainted with film's two sequels preceding-if they had been interlinked at least as ofThree Colors Trilogy (Blue / White / Red)parts were, this work is something philosophic, expressing a fate of ""living by sword"" while characters were engaged into a modestly screened variety of sex-activities in a black-and-white reality of illogical script actions.Well, there are many masterpieces not supposed for the Joe Doe's understanding."
2,5 stars based on excellent Criterion production; 00000 for the movie!,"This pertains to the Criterion Collection version; the movie remains interesting but BAD...painful. After trying to watch it it many times; I give up. However, this edition is superior in all aspects and the ""extras"" are enlightening. Buy it if you like the movie."
3,You will hate/love this book if you hate/love Fujimori,"No matter how much your hate blinds you, it is impossible to deny his simply awesome accomplishments. I find it sad that he is hated (by some people) more than the ...terrorists he defeated. Perhaps it's because he was so effective in everything he did: he exposed the utter worthlessness of his opposition ..."
1,Who are we kidding?,"If you really want to know what Peru was under Fujimori you should try ""The Fujimori File"" by British journalist Sally Bowen.I don't think the book is on sale on the U.S., but it is worth it as it has what Kimura's book lacks: objectivity. Don't let previous reviews fool you, as they do not really tackle the book's relevance. All they want to do is glorify Fujimori's past and push their own political agenda, just like Kimura. ""Fujimoristas"" (like Kimura) are still passionate and vocal about their leader, and they will always be there, just as there always will be Neo-nazis or communists. At present time, though, they are just an anedocte in Peru's political landscape and Kimura's book (like Juan Ortecho explains) nothing more than a pamphlet."
3,Planet Waves design flaw,"The Planet Waves cables may be well made in other regards, but they have one significant flaw: The rubber coating on the plug housing is too thick. It prevents the plug from sliding all the way into the jack and locking with its mate. This means your cable can easily lose contact. Fortunately, it's an easy fix. Get a utility knife and peel off about 1/16"" from the rubber at the plug base. You'll get a little rubber donut.They should have made the plug shaft longer if they wanted to add a layer of rubber to the base of the plug. Bad design. D'oh!"
1,Total garbage,Don't buy this cable. It is total garbage. I've gone through two since 2009. The store I purchased the original from did replace it in 2010 but now the replacement is shorting out just as the first one did. Some lifetime warranty. I go to sit down to play my 5 sting bass and the cable is shorting out AGAIN. I couldn't believe it. How could a company produce such junk? I love D'Addario bass strings but this instrument cable has extremely poor workmanship. The connections are of very low quality. Don't buy this product. Trust me.
4,Don't take it so seriously!,"This is an old-time favorite book of mine, published the year I was born. I've waited a long time to find a copy for me to share with my child. The illustrations are fabulous and the rhymes keep kids giggling. It's a sweet message, but not one that's meant to teach all aspects of personal safety. I'll always love this book!"
4,Book teaches difference between strangers and others,"This book was a part of my childhood collection and I loved it. Can't wait to see the updated illustrations. Strangers were always a tremendous and constant concern to my parents and I can say that this book was a great help in starting conversations and showing us the difference between a stranger and other people we encountered. As a teacher, mom and former child, I highly recommend this story. It is both effective and enjoyable."
1,"It may be a sentimental favorite, but it's ridiculous.","I purchased this book at the same time I purchased Protecting the Gift: Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe by Gavin De Becker. I read Never Talk to Strangers first, and was very disappointed. What do camels with bony knees, grouchy grizzly bears, parachuting hawks, a rhinoceros waiting for a bus, coyotes asking the time, and cars with whales at the wheel have to do with teaching my child about strangers - other than their ability to rhyme with the phrase ""Never talk to strangers, please.""?After reading Protecting the Gift, I decided to return this book rather than share it with my 3 1/2 year old daughter, especially after the author specifically mentioned the book Never Talk to Strangers in a chapter about why merely teaching children not to talk to strangers doesn't work. I would rather teach my children that it is *strangeness* (inappropriate behavior that's relevant), not strangers, that can be dangerous."
1,Horrible,"I am saddened to see this book advertised as a book about strangers. In what way? It only talks about animals! I don't need a literal interpretation to teach my kids, but good grief, have it relate in some way to the subject matter. The last parts about certain people knowing someone so it's ok to say hi and invite them over is so blantantly wrong, especially in today's world. I could care less who my daughter's teacher knows. How on earth is that not a stranger to me and my child? If this book was left as a sing-songy book about animals, fine. But because it's being advertised as a book to help teach your kids about strangers, it's wrong wrong wrong. What a waste of a few dollars."
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"I bought this book hoping it would help reinforce what I've been teaching my children about stranger danger - I was greatly disappointed. I read it to my 6 year old and had to re-teach our safety rules that I'm always going over with him. If you're hoping that this book will help you solidify what's OK and what's not OK, this is not the book. It teaches that someone a teacher introduces you to is A-OK, while I teach ""The Safe Side"" DVD method - my kids understand that teachers, coaches and friends of my husband and myself are ""kinda knows"" who are to be respected, but NEVER obeyed if they ask my kids to go somewhere or do something without my permission. We have a list of safe adults that are to be trusted 100% and they know who those people are.It hurt to do it, but I dropped this book in the trash. I don't even want to donate it to someone else."
4,"Wow, What Irony!","This is a pretty interesting crime movie that has been overshadowed by the irony of it: Christopher Reeve playing a man in a wheelchair, and he himself being paralyzed not long after this movie.This story concerns a cop who gets paralyzed and then gets revenge on his wife and brother, both of whom were having an affair behind his back which he knew about. Joe Mantegna's role, I thought, was the best, as the pursuing cop on the case, although Reeve is very good, too. Kim Cattrall's garbage-mouth helps make her a convincing villain as the cheating wife.There is one major credibility problem, however, with this film that might have you shaking your head. You'll have to check to movie to know what I mean, because I don't want to spoil it here. The film is a worth a look, however - definitely recommended. It will have you involved."
5,Above Suspicion was a Great Movie!,"For Once the bad guy wins! Finally a movie that is more realistic, after all OJ did get off. This movie was one for the records! Reeves was Excellent!"
3,Art mimics Life,"What I find most interesting about this story is that it gives a virtual prediction in film of what happens in reality to Christopher Reeves' life.Reeves' character, Dempsey, is a police officer who gets shot in a crime bust early in the film. This leaves him a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair, and unable to use his lower body. He subsequently becomes depressed and suicidal. Does this ring a bell for anyone else here?I was surprised the reviews I read below didn't mention the uncanny coincidence in the screenplay written five years before Reeve's tragic accident that left him a quadriplegic, a disability Christopher Reeves never recovered from and to which he finally succumbed."
4,Prophetic movie about Reeves in wheel-chair.,"This movie was Christopher Reeves last movie before his freak accident that left him paralyzed. The acting is what makes this movie great, but you must get by your emotions during the brother's affair with Reeves' wife. Definitely not for children."
1,These are terrible!,I bought these without hesitation because they were Clarks. They hurt my feet so badly I can't wear them.
5,His best,"Of all Howard Alden's Concord CDs, this is his best and is certainly my favorite. Everything works here: the choice of tunes is perfect and the playing impeccable. Almost all the tunes are taken up or medium-up tempo, and they all swing like mad. There is an especially inspired and cooking version of Jimmy Giuffre's ""Four Brothers"" composition (made famous first by Woody Herman, of course), and of a catchy and swinging Sam Jones tune called ""Bittersweet,"" which is a blues with an 8-bar bridge. Very nice and highly recommended."
5,Lessons Learned,Taking control of your own medical problems and not being satisfied with first diagniois was very critical to his survival. A lesson we should all learn from. Faith is good but actual medical expertise is more important. I was also enlightened by the tretment of Jimmy Carter by the Clintons. I recommend this book to all.
3,"just ok, dissapointing after reading reviews","maybe i expected too much, but this book only has a good title.I expected a book more like ""tuesdays with morrie"". which was: you get inspired about life & realize there really is no such thing as a bad day through the story being told.in this book, hamilton sort of just tells you to believe ""there is no such thing as a bad day"" and then he explains logically why a good mental attitude is good for you.a better title would be: ""how i learned that positive mental attitude is helpful in my battle against cancer""i hate to diss the book, it just was not a fun or exciting read for me."
3,Disappointing,"Based on the other reviews, and my own respect for Ham Jordan, I had been expecting a lot from this book. I was, frankly, disappointed. Mr. Jordan has written a mish-mash of a book. His stories of his tenure in Vietnam, his time in the White House, and (most bizarrely) a distant relative's participation in the civil rights struggle have very little to do with his struggle against cancer (at least he doesn't relate them to each other well). His account of his own battles, while full of advice about how to get the best cancer care, really do not go into much detail about his despair or how it changed his life (other than when he basically says that he appreciates each day more). I had expected a more coherent package. If you want to know a little more about Ham Jordan, this isn't a bad book, but it's neither really about cancer nor about his political or personal career (the book does not even mention his current occupation)."
5,Bogart's Final Film,"The Harder they Fall is a hard hitting expose of the boxing racket, and a racket it is. Excellent performances by Humphrey Bogart, as a Sportwriter turned Boxing Press Agent,Rod Steiger, Edward Andrews, Nehemiah Persoff, and the always great ( and underrated ) Jan Sterling. An Excellent Screenplay by Philip Yordan, from a Budd Schulberg Novel. Mark Robson's Direction is swift. ***** Stars"
4,Some guys can sell out; others just can't,"Bogart does both. Good story, good film. Good performances. Interesting. Well worth seeing. Good dvd."
1,Could not use DVD on my DVD Player,I was unable to view this DVD beucase it did not work in my DVD player. would it be possible to exhnge it for a DVD that works on US DVD players?
4,Surprising,"If you only got 6 songs on your album, they better be good. And Lil Slim doesn't disappoint. After hearing my friends copy of it at a visit, I was pleasantly surprised. The song ""Eagle St. Bounce"" is REAL nice. Check this out if you got an extra 7 bucks in your pocket."
3,lil Slim,THis cd is lil Slim on the old school cash money records. I got this cd for one song only it is blunt after blunt that song is super tight for an old song. The rest of the songs aredecent.The best thing is that the tracks are produced by manny fresh. The Worst part is that it on 6 songs long. But its still a good album.
1,Mystery Magazine,Opportunities for graduates? Graduate school openings? What the hell is the magazine about? You'd think the publishers would care enough to tell us SOMETHING.
1,Uninteresting with many typos.,This book is garbage. The typos in the problem section are frustrating (check out the free body diagram answers for chapter 4) and the material is poorly presented. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Not Quite What You'd Expected...,"Ok, I've been a dancer (although not a belly dancer) most of my life and a certified fitness instructor since 1988, and I've never seen any anyone simply go through the motions like Rania. She is beautiful and has impossibly incredible abs but she is SO stiff. AND she is absolutely vapid. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know where she is. Rania's background dancers have more talent and panache than she does, and are apparently happier to be doing this video than she is. The workout itself is good for beginners and fun if you watch anyone but Rania, but I didn't learn much about belly dancing. I'd hoped I would learn a little more than was begrudgingly offered. Many ""moves"" are basic for any aerobics class."
2,"Very Little Sweat, Too Light","I recently started working out again after having had a slipped disc. I needed to start with something light yet exciting enough to keep my interest. So, naturally I thought this dvd would be perfect.I barely broke a sweat in this workout, so everytime I see the cover, I break into a laugh.I expected to have some authentic belly dance moves. I've taken a class of beginner's belly dance and I guess I expected something along those lines.This dvd left me feeling cheated out of my money. Now, I feel hesitant to buy another belly dancing dvd workout. Maybe I just need an intermediate dvd workout.....Hope this helps."
2,Mediocre,Rania's tapes are well-produced but this one did not make me sweat and it was much harder to follow than the Hip Drop Hip. I felt more like a club dancer than a belly dancer. Maybe it was my lack of connection with or inspiration from the music? I did not like this one very much. A fun fitness workout and I like the fact that she repeats things but I felt that some of the movements weren't explored/explained or done slow enough or enough times before trying to choreograph them into a tempo routine.
4,cool moves,"I really enjoyed all of the moves and combinations and techniques. Rania is an awesome teacher and dancer, she does a performance at the end. The music was a bit boring, but still danceable. I liked the fact that you can learn to bellydance to any kind of music. Rania and all the dancers looked beautiful and fit."
2,"lousy instruction, good workout","there was hardly any instruction whatsoever - the workout was good, but you'd need to know all the moves already or you'd be lost. she doesn't break down any of the moves before bringing them up to speed either."
2,No Vacancy,"I own about 115 workout videos, and I bought this one last night, and it is almost horrible. I couldn't believe how short it was, I didn't sweat at all, and Rania's VACANT expression and mediocre at best dancing skills were really irritating me! lol I feel like I wasted my money, I hate that! I usually read reviews on here before I buy, but for some reason didn't on this one, unfortunately. I can't imagine even the most inexperienced person enjoying this video."
3,SLOW,I LOVE LATIN MUSIC. THE MUSIC IN THE VIDEO IS AWFUL. RANIA IS WONDERFUL DANCER.I LOVE THE DANCE ROUTINE AT THE END.THE WORKOUT IS SLOW.
1,Just Awful!,"I cannot believe that I actually spent money for this video. The music is terrible, boring and the moves are pathetic. There are maybe a couple of steps you may like but on the whole, I am so disappointed in Rania. She is so beautiful and capable of so much more. I have her Cardio Shimmy tape also and although I'm not overly impressed with that, either the dance routine is worth keeping the tape. I have two of the tapes from Veena and Neena ( Slim down and Hips, Buns, and Thighs ) and this video cannot compare with the twins.Rania, nothing personal but this one's a bad egg, honey..."
3,The jury's still out,"I bought this tape expecting that there would be children singing these songs (I don't know what prompted me to think that); instead it's an adult woman with a rather high voice. My 3 year old son has only listened to the tape once because I found the music and singing a little grating the first time we heard it. Also, I think that the songs are sung a little too fast for beginners, even though I am a Chinese speaker and can understand what's being said. I may just need to play it hundreds of times, as I do most of my son's music tapes, for him to learn the words."
3,"really annoying, but my daughter loves it","the songs drive me crazy, but my daughter loves them. if you have suicidal tendencies don't buy this, but if you don't and you REALLY love your children do buy it."
5,Great for kids,My 4 year old son just loves the songs. He will listen to it three or four times a day. He has learned all the words in book. All the Chinese say he has very good pronunciation. A friend of mine recommended this book to me. She says they have worn out the tape once and are now on to the CD. The singer sings and also says clearly the words to the songs.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book and CD based on the recommendations of other Amazon reviewers. Many had warned that the CD was really difficult to listen to but said their kids liked it so I went ahead. The CD is really intolerable. A woman sings in a way that does not at all encourage sing-along and is also unpleasant to listen to. The accompanying book has both simplified and traditional characters along with the pinyin, which is interesting, but it is cheaply printed in black-and-white. I suppose it could be used as a coloring book but for over $15 I would have expected higher quality. I would recommend Faye-Lynn Wu's Chinese and English Nursery Rhymes over this book. Faye-Lynn Wu's book is high quality and the children's voices on the CD are endearing and invite sing-along."
5,Also interested in this book...,"I really would like to know where I can find this book. I have Culinaria Spain and Culinaria Italy, which are both wonderful. I recommend both to anyone interested in the foods and cultures of Spain or Italy. Point is, I would like to see this book. Help?"
3,Not Weathertech but does the job....,Got these for my 97 Toyota Landcruiser because they were the brand I could find that offered mat's custom fit to my rig. I have purchased custom fit Weathertech floor mats for another vehicle in the past and these Huskys are not even close in quality or design. They are not a soft pliable rubber but a thin plastic vacuum molded material. It has some give but the outer lip (keeps water from escaping) would easily crack or break if you're not careful. Don't get me wrong they fit well and serve their purpose of keeping dirt and water off the carpet but I doubt they will last more than a few years and they are not as well made as Weathertech products. Would buy again unless Weathertech starts making custom molded for this application.
5,CHRIS DORSEY IS THE BEST RAPPER ALIVE.,"This is very raw, very good lp from THE BG who would release another 7 cds over the next 8 years despite the fact he was locked up and battling hard drugsif you like CASH MONEY get this NOW."
4,"eh, its ok","As a bmxer myself i refrain from buying these games, but i was going on a trip so i said what the hell? here is what i thought: the music was horrid, the graphics were ok considering it was gameboy, the trick list was high but they kept combos to a limit of 2 (more realistic but not as much fun), i didn't like the fact that the only way to go on to another level was by entering a password. if u forget to write it down or something u cant get to that level. i lost my passwords three times. the choice of characters was good, but their faces should look better. the game was really easy to beat but i think its probably the best game to get but only if u can't ride or something. GO BMX! RIDE HARD OR GO HOME -tj"
3,Mat Hoffman??? Or his this Tony Hawk,"a lto of people like mat hoffman but not his vidio game. One of the reasons myte be that it is a bike copy of Tony Hawk pro skater. It has all of the same stuff. The grafics are also not that good. If you compare this to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX Grafics. dave mirra's game has really good grafics, and a better selection or players. I think is Mat hoffman had better grafics better players and better levels it would be a lot beeter. The only thing i like about the game is how you could make your own skate park(another copyed feature of tony hawk) I also think you should be able to do any move you want with out getting youe ""special up"". That was what i this about Mat hofmans games."
5,Wonderful teaching opportunity!,"The stories in this book are great for introducing students to the strange and marvelous story-telling style of Patrick Chamoiseau, the concept of créolité, and the history of French colonialism in Antilles. I am no expert at all, but I really enjoy pairing Chamoiseau's stories alongside other works to help students see and appreciate the particularity of post-colonial literature. One good pairing is Charles Perrault, ""Blue Beard"" and Chamoiseau, ""A Little Matter of Marriage,"" which is essentially the same story. But what a difference in style! The preface is extremely useful (and quite poignant) too. Two thumbs up!"
2,"disappointing, perhaps stereotypically","I was woefully disappointed at the triviality (I can think of no more precisely applicable term) of the stories in this volume. Well told or not, there is next to no content in these tales. It would be stereotyping to say, gee, consider the uneducated oafs who created this ""literature"": it's no wonder they couldn't do any better. Well, we won't do that; we'll just say that the book was not at all what one might hope for. And, I should add, I own hundreds of titles under the folklore/mythology/anthropology umbrella, and I'm intensely familiar with the motifs that recur worldwide in oral literature."
4,Works great with an iPhone,"As an alternative to a standalone digital flash voice recorder, I picked up this microphone to use with my iPhone to record interviews. The quality has improved a great deal and I'm happy with my purchase."
2,NOT GOOD,It was not better than my Canon EOS Rebel t4i BUILT IN Mic.... Returning this mic and searching for something better.
3,unidirectional mic,"I use this with my digital voice recorder, Olympus WS-321M. The sound quality of this ME-51S is better than the built-in mic my recorder comes with; more frequency range: it picks up bass better. Normally I have my recorder to record on this settings: mono HQ. This setting works well for classroom lectures. I got this mic because my teachers who walks around a lot while speaking or have high pitch voice are not recorded well. But the problem with this mic, when played back, is that the sound volume from left to right are significantly different, depending on where the teacher is standing. Also I have to record in stereo mode, because in mono, the right mic doesn't record any sound. Right now I think my built in mic, which is omni-directional, is better for what I use it for. I just have to set the recording to XQ, which is the highest quality. ME-51S has 2 unidirectional mic which I think would be useful for 2 people talking in each side of this mic."
4,Olympus ME-51S,This mic is awesome for being so small it picks everything some times to much it could use a wind damper of some kind to reduce wind noise but it works really gerate
2,did not enhance recording quality for olympus recorder,"I bought this external microphone in addition to the digital olympus voice recorder dm-520 that I already owned, hoping it would enhance the already impressive microphone in the recorder. Well, it did not, the recording sounded the same with or without the external microphone. Good news is that the sound of my olympus recorder is already amazing, bad news, I had to send the microphone back. However, for someone who wants to enhance the recording quality of an old pc or recorder, this external microphone might do the trick."
3,I felt cheated by the price.,"The recording quality is better than the original built in mic, however, I felt cheated by the price. This mic and many mics are not wind proof. For the price, I would have expected something to cover the mic so that it doesn't pick up wind. I'm here to complain about the price."
2,Too Sensitive,"This mic is so sensitive that I can't use it as a lapel mic without getting high frequency crackle. I've even covered most of the mic with dampening material and clip it on just above my waist. I've tried every setting on my Olympus WS-300M, a recorder for which this mic is recommended, but cannot get rid of the crackle while using the mic clipped to my body. (The voice recorder records cleanly with its built in mics, though at a much lower volume.) I think this mic is really engineered for setting in the center of a conference table.If anyone knows of a better stereo lapel mic for Olympus voice recorders like the WS-300M and its family, I'd love to hear about it."
3,Not for when people talk over each other,"I got this mic hoping that I would be able to voice record during my field work, but did not really help because people were talking over each other. When kids scream further away, you can not even here person next to you. You definitely need a directional one which my old Olympus' embedded one works fine.I think this is a good piece if you are recording in a conference room when people talk one by one, but not in a crowded room. It has a high receptivity, so it will get anything around. It also does not work outside when a plane is flying over."
1,They sent the wrong size!,"I ordered 150' of 24"" poultry netting. They sent 50' of 72"" netting. That's the same amount of wire, but now I will have to cut it into 24"" strips to use it. That is a lot of extra work. If I had the time, I would return it for the right item, but I have to get the project finished right away and can't wait for them to send the right thing. What an inconvenience!"
4,"if you have to have a helmet, this is a good one","It looks cool, has a detachable visor that actually keeps the sun out of your eyes. The design provides plenty of air flow and it is quite light. Well worth it."
3,Needs more padding.,"The style, color and ruggedness are top notch. The only thing I am critical of is the lack of padding, especially on the front of the helmet. Even with a sweat cap I usually wear underneath a helmet, with this one there is still rubbing on my forehead. I took the padding from my previous helmet, attached a set of Velcro tabs to hold them in place and now the helmet is much more comfortable to wear. For a hundred-dollar helmet, you would think the manufacturer would put in sufficient padding."
5,Great Helmet,"This Bell helmet is very comfortable. I've had two Giro's but the Giro's are little harder on your head. Also, I think that the Bell is designed for a less ""round"" head more ""oval"" so it fits perfect for my type of head."
4,Sharp Comfortable Bike Helmet,I find this helmet to be very comfortable & stylish. We are having a very hot summer in Chicago and the helmet has very good ventilation.
4,An astronomy book that covers the basic facts,"""Planets Around the Sun,"" by Seymour Simon, combines many astronomical photographs with an easy-to-read text. The book is a basic overview of the planets of the solar system. A sample of the writing style: ""We live on a planet called Earth. [new page] Earth is one of the nine planets that travel around the sun.""The book includes a comparative chart that lists each planet along with basic facts: distance from the sun, orbital period, number of moons (if any), etc. The book sticks to only the most basic facts; for example, the moons of Mars and other planets are not mentioned by name."
2,Star Trek Invasion?,"Hard to tell it's Star Trek. Kept my 6yo boy entertained for a few hours, but was too frustrating to really enjoy, and lame overall. Bleah. If you want to do Star Trek ship fighting, get Star Fleet Command!"
3,Inconsistent Quality,"I first tasted this tea about 6 months ago, bought it in a grocery store in Philadelphia's Chinatown, 25 bags for about $3.00 as I remember. Very good,similar to Tazo ""China green tips"", but stronger, equal to 2 bags of Tazo. So I ordered 100 bags, very inexpensive, as a gift for a friend in another State this month. Delivery service fine. But the tea tasted awful, brewed with filtered water that was fine. I asked my friends to throw it out.Next time I'm in Chinatown I'll try another 25 bag box. WAS almost as good as the much more expensive Longjing/Lungching teas I've had from ""Teaspring""."
3,Better as a reference than a gude,"Here's the problem: Context isn't considered in the book's FORMAT; the book gives phrases and idioms in alphabetical order. There are examples of usage given for each entry, but the alphabetical listing is not helpful for students learning new phrases, that is, there is no grouping in context. For example, if you want to learn a set of common phrases used when telephoning, or when you perhaps want to find out how to interrupt someone politely or otherwise, you're out of luck with this book. No way to go to a section on phoning, or conversational guidelines. To use this book, you need to have heard a phrase, memorized it, and want to look it up. It can be a good reference, probably useful for students doing translations.In short, it's a shelf book, not a book geared for teachers to teach with or students to teach themselves from."
2,non-recommendable book,"I will positively be heistate to recommend this to other probable buyers becuase this book is composed of contents it is not helpful to learn English expression.In addition, this book loses my common and prevalent idioms.I don't like to recommend all of you to get this book."
4,Very good book for non native Americans,"This book really delivers what it promises, fully recommend this one to people interested to have a very good English skills."
5,Common American Phrases in Everyday Context,"Thanks for the delivery! It was fast enough! The book was as new as you said!The only trouble was the sticker on the envelope which contained my name and address.It was almost impossible to read. I don't know what happened. The typing had almost vanished!The letter carrier must have had a hard time making it out! In the end, all was well,though.Thanks again!"
2,Cheaply made,This device has a mind all its own. It has difficulty resetting the pitch count and will oftentimes tabulate 2 pitches for every one push of the button. Do not recommend.
2,Not reliable,"Balls and strikes tally has been consistently less than the pitch count total. I'm constantly glancing at the pitch count, so I know that's accurate and verified by the opposing coach, however the balls and strikes tally never adds up to the total, so who the hell knows. Buttons are also a little too hard to push. I'm switching back to mechanical."
2,"skip this, go mechanical","I purchased this product for this last season of baseball. This product gave me and my other coaches nothing but trouble. The buttons would stick and not record or double record a pitch. The device was not consistent about clearing the count. The only button that was consistent was the A/B button. On top of all of this, the battery low indicator came on. I went to replace the battery and found I had to remove several screws just to get the back off. Then I had to remove another screw to release the battery. Very inconvenient. After the new battery the counter last about a week before it quit altogether.Save yourself the bother and get a mechanical pitch counter."
3,nice product,"The price is right, works pretty good. My only fault I found is the buttons tend to stick a bit which gets frustrating. overall it's a good deal."
2,Just OK,"It is really a pain to navigate through functions (i.e. turning it in, resetting pitch counts, etc)."
2,Great shoe that does not fit,"This shoe got size grossly mislabelled. I ordered size 11 and was afraid of being tight since I wear 11 or 11 1/2.When I opened the box I found gigantic shoe clearly at least size 13, but label said 11.In the same order, my other pair from different brand came exactly 11 as labelled.Quality seems to be good, but being 4 sizes over would not make you any good."
1,delayed again?,"Now it's going to be released in March? What happened? First it was September 29, then November 2, then November 21, Then February 23... at this rate I may as well wait for the X-Box version."
4,Matt Hoffmans Pro BMX / dudes,This game is very good. The tricks are so real. When I bought this game I did not know it would be this great. When your going to hit a jump it seems like you really know what your doing in real life. This game stinks really bad.
3,my review (please read),The game is pretty much the same as tonyhawk proskater except for the fact thats it is bikes. although the game just dosent have that special something to make it a great game like the tony hawk pro skater series. although it is still fun to play every now and then.
5,I'm The Best,"to the guy who got 39k....bah! if you want to ride with the big boys, i got a grind worth 859,000 pts. my high score is 1,800,000. i rule."
2,Lame,"From what I've seen so far, and the stinky demo that came with Hawk 2, it's gonna be a dud. They've held it back for 6 months probably cause they knew it was weak, but they've gotta release it sooner or later..."
1,I could only wait 3 months,"I ca'nt believe that this game still iz'nt out! I played the demo and was excited and waited for it for Christmas like they said and it never came out but then my friendz finally talked me into playing the Mirra BMX game and it rockz! Compared to the Hoffman demo there are soooo many tricks you can do and the crashes are sick! The whole game is hecka sick! And I do'nt care when Hoffman comes out now, I already played Tony Hawk."
5,the best bmx game out,"i liked the demo of this game better then Dave Mirra's game. i can't wait till i get to play the full gamethe reviewer that said (Oh yeah, they left the skateboard sounds in - very strange).Thats why it is called a DEMO - How strange is that???you are kind of strange just for saying that"
5,Hilarious!,"Iain Levison has written a novel that is at least as funny as his earlier comic memoir, ""A Working Stiff's Manifesto."" Here, his characters find drastic solutions to unemployment and indebtedness that are as hilarious as a Coen brothers movie. I couldn't put the book down, it was so entertaining! It reminded me of ""Blood Simple."""
4,"Wicked, but Wicked Funny","If you like Richard Dooling, you will love this book. I wandered into our local Public Library, and saw this slim volume on display. I flipped through it, and started reading a third of the way in. Within one page, I had to go to the corner of the library, and could not get up until I had finished it."
3,Witty and Smart but Forced,"The novel is very compelling in the beginning because Levison has a sharp, pungent way of describing the malaise that follows factory layoffs. The narrator is extremely funny. So why only three stars? Because the observational elements in the novel work (they read like essays) while the plot--a laid-off worker turning to murder for hire--was too morally repugnant for me to relax and enjoy the narrator's laughs and gags. Maybe it's just me, but it's hard for me to establish a bond with a cold-blooded murderer who happens to keep his warm humanity in reserve for the down and out working man. Another flaw--the novel's last act appears forced, a gratuitious plot line to make the novel languish toward the 178-page mark.Having said this, I still like Levison. He is so smart and funny that I bought his nonfiction book, A Working Stiff's Manifesto, a satire about many of his cruddy jobs, which I look forward to reading."
1,What Is This...,"This is not a CD for kids or somebody who likes good rock music.This is a joke improv band but with no laughs. If you like to cringe to childlike musicmade for adults with bad vocals this is the CD for you. This CD has no target audience and seems to hit none. This is an off target CD with no point. If you like good funny rock music, which this band tries to do, buy a Jack Black CD."
1,Not Worth The Dollar I Paid At Walmart,"This is one of the very worst prints of any film I have ever seen on DVD!!! Wheeler and Woolsey are a very funny comedy team who starred in at least a dozen films in the 1930's, they seemed on the verge of being a real cult act in the 1990's when American Movie Classics ran almost their entire RKO filmography. Alas, today an old movie on American Movie Classics is one from the 1960's and while Turner Classic Movies owns the rights to the RKO library, they don't show much of W&W whose humor is a perhaps a little too low rent for TCM's ""classy"" image. It's a shame because they are genuinely funny, ingenue Dorothy Lee is a doll, and this actually is a good movie so I hate panning this DVD but the print quality is deplorable. TCM is going to have to air those W&W films eventually because people can only sit through so many showings of the same MGM classics over and over so I would just wait for them to air this if I were you."
3,Fun W&W vehicle,"Typical outing with Wheeler and Woolsey. The plot is irrelevant, of course, as they toss of their usual brand of punning dialog exchanges. This one features their frequent screen partner, Dorothy Lee, whose presence enlivens the proceedings. This particular DVD contains a rather poor-quality print of this film, however, but considering the cost, it's still a fun addition to any classic comedy collection."
1,"Amusing movie, awful print","There are plenty of poor quality DVDs on the market, and this is one of the worst. This is an amusing Wheeler & Woolsey comedy, but the copy is taken from a duped and edited C & C Television print; the original runs 74 minutes and this copy runs 62! To add insult to injury, this is a bad dupe; the climactic shoot-out takes place in a darkened hotel, and here it looks like they're in one of those Warner Brothers cartoon caves where only the eyeballs are visible. Bad sound, bad picture quality, and edited to hell-yuck! Anyone in the market for this title should get the Alpha Video edition, which is the best copy of this title currently available (and it's complete)."
1,Quality of the product,"I love the stories of Imaro; they are well-written and a whole lot of fun. BUT, the physical quality of the book I received is terrible. The pages are falling away from the binding before one complete read-through. I don't know if the glue went bad or what, but this is a shoddy, shoddy product."
4,Her voice IS THE KEY IN HERE---SHE HAS IMPROVED A LOT!!,"In the previous Cd, her voice sounds kinda DULL and as if that something was missing. Well on this Cd, she really improves VOCALLY. Her voice range is REALLY COOL. And the Lyrics are the BEST TOO. When you listen to the Lyrics, you will just REMINISCE so much from your past and relate to her MUSIC. IT IS A WELL DONE CD."
5,sera el mejor,"hijole que podemos esperar de esta gran chica, solo lo mejor.no tengo el disco en mis manos todavia, he solo escuchado los cortitos y si asi suenan los cortos , que vengan las canciones enteras."
3,Charming little story,"An early novel in the Hainish cycle, Rocannon's World is a small story set on Fomalhaut II, inhabited by few different alien species. Rocannon is a researcher examining the world and its population for the League of Worlds, when rebel forces destroy his ship and kill all of his companions. Rocannon is stranded on the world with no way to contact friends.Fortunately he has friends on the planet. Armed with their bronze age technology, friendship and courage, Rocannon takes on the technologically advanced enemies. Sometimes technology just isn't the key! Le Guin paints an interesting world and tells a good story, even if it pales in comparison to her better-known Hainish novels."
2,Not Worth It!,"One has to wonder if she really wasn't mad . . in her unfathomable feeling for her less than stellar husband. He was able to find water cooled by ice some 500 years ago, and as soon as he started drinking glass after glass of it, one knew that there was something in that water that would do him in. And seeing the Spanish nobles so anxious to take the crown from their legitimate Queen made no sense . . . there were too many unanswered questions, and too obvious shifts in plot to make this anything more than a pleasant view of early sixteenth century fashions and mores. It was not a very good story, not very good history either, and I would not recommend it."
2,Mad yawn in fine regalia,"My wife and I both agreed that the not-so-merry Juana was decidedly bonkers halfway through the film, but the film's point of view that she was simply love-obsessed drained any other sympathy that might have been developed for her condition. The result: detachment from the characters, indifference as to the outcome, and yawns.Only the magnificent costumes kept our eyes open.Maybe those steeped in Spanish culture, sexual sacrifice, and the whore/Madonna dichotomy will find much to enjoy."
5,Great for Kids!!!!!!!!!!,This is my son's favorite book. I have had to buy it three times. He is 1 and a 1/2 years old and he has to look at this book at least twice a day. The pop ups are great and my son loves it when the King roars at the end. As far as I am concerned this is THE Pop-Up book.
2,What a Dissapointment...,"I purchased this video a while ago going by what the DVD cover said and I really had no clue who Rania was. The workout does make you break a good sweat that's why I am giving it 2 stars, however it is very repetitive, therefore it gets boring, not to mention the dancers in the back who lack gracefulness.Rania did not impress me in her bonus performances. Belly dancing is a sensual dance, not a sexual one and she makes an erotic act out of it. She rates very low on her belly dancing skills and her instructions are annoying. Thank goodness there's an option to workout to the music without the narration."
4,Keep an ambulance nearby!,"While this is certainly an enjoyable workout, it is my least favorite in the series. This is because the final routine doesn't look as good as the other workouts. As the title suggests, you will get your heart rate up by doing the ""shimmy"" (moving your hips up and down really quickly). This particular move is essential in Bellydancing, and this workout will give you a lot of practice. I am quite fit and this workout left me puffing and panting.However, in one section of the workout, the narration is inconsistent with the visuals. Further, I haven't noticed any significant weight loss and the stretches in the cooldown section may be a little difficult for some people. The bonus workout is similar to the ""Bellydance Boogie"" and ""Hip Hop Hip Drop"" workouts (which are great!)The bottom line is, getting your heart rate up doesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight. But you will learn some vital moves and have fun!"
3,"Decent workout, but a bit cheesy","This workout really does get your pulse going, but the cheesy music and graceless background dancers take a lot of the enjoyment out of it. Also, when I bought the DVD I was looking forward to watching Rania's extra performances, but they were rather amateur as she has very little bellydancing finesse. I won't be buying anymore of Rania's DVDs. I suggest Veena and Nina's DVDs for being much more enjoyable and authentic bellydance workouts."
1,Bellydancers Beware,"What an absolutely appalling DVD!The only thing more monotonous as Rania's droning instruction is the workout itself. Don't get me wrong, I worked up a fairly decent sweat, but sharply banging my head against the wall for an hour would have given me the same workout with the added incentive of saving me a great deal of time and money. I've never seen a more dismal, soulless bellydancer than Rania. Fake vacant smile plastered firmly on her face, her dull eyes wander all over the studio as she `dances' the routine - checking herself out in the monitor every two or three seconds.The Special Features of the DVD were fantastic - turning off Rania's slurring blether was a godsend, and the dance pieces she performs are sterling examples of what not to do in order to become a captivating and charismatic dancer."
5,"strange, isn't it?","This is a kick-... workout, and Rania's performances at the end are just breathtaking. Isn't it funny that the only negative review suggests buying the Twins videos? I think the Twins are jealous......"
4,More music from Mother's,"More music from Mother's, Peter Gunn's favorite watering hole. Manne's second LP of Mancini's TV show music has weaker material & a different front line (trumpeter Conte Candoli & alto saxophonist Herb Geller replaced by trumpeter Joe Gordon & Richie Kamuca on tenor.). This followup is more bluesy than the first album. Maybe not essential Shelly Manne, but both albums taken together are classic Mancini & ""crime jazz."""
3,A Free Man of Color Traps The Reader,"I agree with several of the reviewers that this book was difficult to get into and Ms. Hambly added a tremendous amount of detail...that is where I end my agreement with those readers that felt it was too much information. I think we sometimes get lazy and just want the facts. To often we just want story to move along quickly. Yes, I struggled to keep the characters straight and this was definately not the best book for reading on the subway 5 to 10 minutes at a time. But it was wonderful and brought the reality of people outside the norm (indians, blacks and the poor) to the fore and lets those who don't understand their plight an opportunity to get it. I loved the book! But it is best read where you can concentrate on the content."
1,Who are these people??,"I have never felt so lost in a book. Ms. Hambly seemed to have dropped at least three new characters in EACH page, and that confused the heck out of me! That should have never been done in any mystery novel. Its a shame how a very promising plot was flooded by something like this. It's a total waste."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. GOOD STORY BAD WRITING,"I PURCHASED ALL THREE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES, FREE MAN OF COLOR,FEVER SEASON, AND GRAVEYARD DUST. BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED. THE BASICSTORIES ARE OK BUT THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH BUSY DETAILS TO TRY TO SORT THROUGH. MAINLY NAMES AND WHO THEY BELONG TO. I READ ON AVERAGE 3-4 BOOKS WEEKLY AND READ ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING BUT IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO FINISH THESE BOOKS. I THOUGHT AFTER THE FIRST ONE THAT THE OTHERS WOULD GET BETTER. NO SUCH LUCK. SUCH A GOOD BASIC IDEA RUINED BY TOO MUCH INFORMATION."
4,Awesome book by an awesome Author,"This is the 2nd book I have read by Barbara Hambley and I am going right back to get the next book in this series.The author has a way of putting you into the setting and bringing the plot to life.At times it is painful to learn of the struggles of our African American ancestors but the author goes even deeper to explain the different social levels of all the people of that era.This book has a little of everything History, mystery,action adventure and drama. I highly recommend it."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I think (although not sure) that the author understands the place and time. I just didn't get it and and I didn't care enough to work at it. So I moved onto my long list of ""wanna reads""."
3,An acquired taste,3.5 Stars. As with most acquired tastes this novel does take some effort to apprecitate what Ms. Hambly has accomplised. However once the reader becomes acclimated to the time period and the societal differences and nuances of this era the story then becomes very compelling. The only other minor criticism I could have of this book is I wish that the multitude of characters had been developed a little more fully. I believe that because of her intention of growing this into a series this part of the novel was neglected a little bit. On the other hand I am blown away by the amount of research that had to be done to create the detailed and intricate atmosphere of 1830's New Orleans so intimately. This book takes a little more effort on the readers part but is well worth it in the end and like an acquired taste will leave you with vivid memories and a strong sense of appreciation.
1,A Free Man of Color,"A flimsy story with more attention to background than characters. Seems to be the norm in publishing currently--pick a background, research it, than throw in a story. (A Free Man of Color)"
5,Excellent,"It is an excellent book , although prety much political. From legal point of view it is interesting and very useful,best regards, Snejina"
5,Latin Delight,Manfredo Fest is a legend he has got his own style and indeed very enjoyable. I guess that is why he has been very popular especially in Latin Jazz music world. His music like very good expensive wine will impress you immediately. Thanks for the great music over the years Manfredo
5,The truth,"Owen Lattimore was my uncle. He was not a liar, nor a communist. Anyone in doubt should read more of his wide body of work, to understand that he was a scholar, not a subversive."
3,"Some good, Some boring","This was a good collection of stories, while some take a while to ponder before you actually get the concept, and the sad part is, by that time the excitement of the story has worn off. However, that is only a fraction of the stories. Many of the others are just plain disturbing and terrifyingly real."
5,Mummies galore,"As complete of a guide to ancient Egyptian mummies as there can be. The knowledge that Dr. Brier shares in this book is amazing. It is a reference book that reads as easy as a novel. And it is a fun read. Don't believe me, try it yourself. Beware, Dr. Briar's Ancient Egypt books has the power to turn a browsing reader into a full-fledged researcher. I warned you."
5,Still A Pleasure,I found a good used copy. I still enjoy this game much as when it was released! Oh the memories...
4,Cool game!,THPS2 is a cool game!With lots of good grafics and you can create your own skater!Codes are very helpful in this game and are useful too! The park editor rocks!
5,BEST GAME EVER MADE,"THPS2 is the greatest game ever made. At first, I thought it was gonna be exactly the same as the first one. It was so different I couldn't believe it. The graphics are a whole lot better. .... It has groups that are atually famous. And as if that wasn't enough they let you create your own skater and skate park. There are also secret characters including Spider-Man. I am a huge Spider-Man fan and when I found this out I was amazed. .... This is the greatest game I have ever played."
5,Cool Game,"This game is fun from the start. You can pick from a wide selection of courses, including Skatestreet, Ventura and Philidelphia with FDR skatepark. Both are real places. The way that the board flips, how the skater's feet move are incredibly accurate. Each skater, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Cabellaro and Rune Glifberg all have special moves, which seperate this game from reality. Fun Factor out of 10: a solid 9.5. A must buy for skates and non-skaters alike."
3,Pretty fun but very hard.,"Let me start by saying after Crazy Taxi, Tony Hawk 2 has the best video game sound track. Another thing great about this is the create a park, I found myself having more fun creating the park than playing the actual game. Now about the actual game, Tony Hawk 2, is very challenging. I have been gaming for a long time (92-01). In all my experience I would have to say that Tony Hawk 2 is the hardest sports game to be 100% complete in. If you can not unlock the cool stuff you will just have to use cheats. The graphics by todays standard are medicore. I reccomend to rent it first before buying it. And if you are good enough you can skate as Spiderman (or just get him with cheats.) This game is pretty fun. To say it is perfect is wrong. Still fun though."
4,Ok Sequal,"If you own the original and got tired of it, don't buy this one. The levels are incredibly similar to the first, as is the gameplay. But there is a whole bunch of stuff you can do now such as unlocking Spider-Man as a charactor, opeing new parks etc. The new career mode lets you edit tricks your skater has. The create-a-park is a pretty good feature, but don't expect to make a huge level because the game only gives you so much space. Try renting it and if you don't get bored of it in those days buy it. You have a lot of stuff to do and it will take a long time."
3,"Good, but more of the same","I dug Hawk 1 big time, but this one seemed like more of the same. I found the wall rides to execute inconsistently especially on the school levels with the alarms. The editor is cool though."
4,"big point are to ""Ezy""","I thout this game was cool but I didn't like how ""Ezy"" it was to bust big trikes/pionts.On Tony-H #number 1 my top score was 124,000 but on Tony-H #number 2 it was 298,000 ""on the first 1-min medal park"".But the game is still nice and I like how the levals are harder.I also think that it was a nice tuch on being aball to make your won skater to play on the game. I give it two board up."
5,A Great Game for Everyone!!,"Since I not really a skater chick I did not think I would really get into this game, but I was wroung. This game is wonderful. Pro Skater 2 is ten times better than the first. The graphics are great. You can even create your own skater and skate park. I would recommend anyone to try this game, because it is so much fun!!"
5,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Review,"Hey Man, I've played the game man. It's new man. I liked it ALOT. You Can Skateboard like, ah, Tony Hawk and stuff, mmm yeah ! I also like the way you can build the tracks to you own size and specification. In retrospect I'm really fired up and I can't wait to have Tony Hawk delivered .........."
5,Don't rent it- buy it,"I got this like 3 weeks ago and my other 4 games back in December. By far, this is my favorite.(but I still like the others) EveryThing has to be unlocked during career mode and you could buy stats for charesters.(I bought a lot for Tony Hawk, so he is the best in the game statiscally) Well , you have to buy this game!"
5,best skateboarding game ever,"if you dont give this game 5 stars, then there is something wrong with you. this game has so many options and so many more tricks than the first. I played the previous Tony Hawk like an addict right up until the sequel came out and i couldn't believe they could make a better game than the first, but they did. probably the only people that have an excuse not to like this game are teachers and parents because the kids grades drop and they don't do any homework...but hey, why not do something fun while being defiant? Bottom line is to buy this game because it is good lovin."
4,AWSOME GAME but impossible moves,"This game is fun but almost everything you do is impossible. The game is fun and challenging but it doesn't get even close to looking real. Trust me, I love skateboarding and I would wait. the first one allowed you to jump off of a building and land, at least you can't do that as easily in the second one but in both games you get right back up after getting hit by a car and a skateboard magically appears under your feet. The makers should have been on earth, in the real world when they designed the game."
4,you might need an endoursment to play,"this game may have overdone it. The second to this series finds Tony a bit older and wiser. You now have to perform harder tricks to gat paid, so you can pay for better stats and better equipment, and only after you earn a certain amount, then you can proceed to other levels. This becomes bothersome. But if that wasn't enough now you can learn new tricks(after paying for them) which you can perform after peak performances and hitting the correct combo buttons. Most times after playing you want to take a nap. You almost long for the days when you just skated or died. I believe the next Tony Hawk game may be set up where Tony becomes retired and as a new recruit you have to fight crime with your new batmobile and skateboard. That's of course only if you make enough money to open those levels up."
5,Tony hawks Pro Skater 2,"I don't have this game for play station, but I do have it for game boy. if you love to skate board, but can't do it , this is the game for you. All I have to say about it is that it's great. ***** out of 5 stars."
4,A Great Buy For A Playststion Owner,"If You Own A Playstation,This Is A Must.Even If Ya Are Not Interested In Skateboarding There Is A Great Chance that Ya Still Would Like This Game,13 Skaters To Choose From,Modes Include Multiplayer(Graffti,Horse Etc),Freeskate,Create-A-Skater And More.Theres A Truck Load Of Secrets To Be Unlocked(Secret Characters,New Boards,Perfect Balance)And Stuff Like That.Spiderman Even Appears For F**k Sake,Stupid To Say The Least But It's Somethin'.Other Skating Games Don't Come Close,It Wipes The Floor With The Original.Buy It!"
4,pretty good vietnam novel,"I'm going to say, despite the lackluster title (which is pretty dull and doesn't draw anyone in), this is a pretty good book.Carl Melcher Goes To Vietnam was originally published as an e-book and was short-listed (along with such high profile authors as Joyce Carol Oates and David McCullough) for the Frankfurt E-Book Award.It's a pretty good book. There is something familiar about the novel. But that is because, like all good stories, it feels like coming home, to use an old cliche. It has well drawn characters, and Clayton very skillfully draws you into the drama of his people. The one weakness of the book is a slight predictability. Many times you are able to see things coming long before they happen, but still, the journey is fun, even if you know the outcome. It isn't like most Vietnam novels, and I'd recommend it."
3,Shallow and dull,"I wasn't touched by this book at all. I found the characters shallow and too numerous to keep track of. That would be fine if this were a war book, but it's not. It's a personal journey work, and the combat is secondary. Little insight is provided into Carl's state of mind as he meanders through Vietnam. And the end of the book leaves us flat as we are left with Carl in his living room watching TV.A personal journey book like this one is supposed to invite us into his world with tremendous detail about the environment, and personal insights into what these events meant. This book doesn't provide much of either.There are some interesting stories in there. That's why I give it three stars. But overall the book needs a lot more detail, fewer characters that are more fully animated, and some editing."
1,This is why you shouldn't be allowed to self-publish,"I think Mr. Clayton needs to work on his writing. It's incredibly jarred, the narrative voice is dull and derivative and in some places he just tries too hard; ""Shaving cream clouds""? Really? Are you an eight-year-old having your first lesson on metaphors?It hit home for me in the second paragraph when he felt the need to explain that ""Beeobee"" is what the letters ""B-O-B"" sound like when you say them. REALLY!? Thanks for explaining that to me, Paul, because y'know... It's difficult for me to get that on my own since I can't possibly read the letters ""B-O-B"" in my head at all. It was just downhill from there really. Not that I read the whole thing, just enough to get myself suitably enraged at the state of modern literature.I almost gave it the benefit of the doubt and awarded this book two stars, purely because I hadn't read it all and because it might have gotten better. But no, I wasted enough of my life on this to warrant giving it one star."
5,Best by Far!,"I own about 15 books that are all on the topic of revising manuscripts and getting published. This book, by far, is the best of them. The self analyzing questions that helped me get to the root of my character's psyche alone were worth the price tag.Thank you Alice Orr!!"

4,KIDS LOVE THIS GAME,ALL FOUR OF MY KIDS LOVE THIS GAME VERY GREAT PRICE THAT I AM BUYING A SECOND ONE. ITS FREE SHPPING THANKS
2,A disappointment.,"I was expecting this game to be more than it was. The graphics were excellent, as were the movie clips which helped to build story line. Now I'll get to what this game lacked. Levels were short, and left no room for ""exploration"". Simba's attacks do not increase as he gets older. It seems slash, maul, etc. were removed. My guess is for violence reasons. Pounce, roll, and roar are his only attacks, which proves to be awkward later in the game. This game is aimed highly at a younger age group. I finished the game in a little over an hour; it was hardly a challenge for me. I am a die hard Lion King fan, and regardless of the disappointment, I'm glad they finally decided to release a 3D formatted game based on TLK. As I said before, this one's for the younger gamers, they should enjoy it."
2,Not a very good movie,I bought this because I am a huge Pink Floyd fan and I wanted it for the soundtrack. I do not think I would make the purchase if I had seen the movie before.
1,More,"I did not like it, I fell asleep while watching ...I expected to enjoy the music of Pink Floyd, but even that was possible"
3,Finally got my hands on this film!!,"...Stefan goes searching for ""the sun, and went after it."" Against his friends warning, Stefan falls for Estelle, but doesn't find out until later that she has been addicted to heroin. Stefan soon gives into temptation and trys the dangerous drug. But, basically he just wants to be loved by Estelle, you'll find out for yourself if the needle brings them closer or not. I have to say that the music in this film, all by Pink Floyd fits the atmosphere tremendously, and flows with the movie. This film is NOT in the vein as other traditional ""drug adiction films"". MORE stands alone! Great photography too of the in's and out's of Europe."
3,For Floyd Fans Only!,"This is actually not a very good movie. The ""draw"" for me was the Pink Floyd score. If you're a serious Floyd person, you ought to have it. The film itself is pretty dated and shallow. A curiosity for the collector."
3,More,"One of the most representative films of the hippy times, together with Denis Hopper's Easy Rider. This is a love story, though the woman is drug addict and the man somewhat jealous and moody. The woman depends in some way on a rich German who lives in Ibiza. The film was photographed by Nestor Almendros."
3,i expected better!!!,well i got this movie out of love for pink floyd but that was a bad idea this movie was a crazy story about a stupid guy who finds a girl and by the end of the movie is a addict there are pleanty of other movies out there that can scare you away from heavy drugs this one was just kinda lame !! but it was cheap so im not that upset..
3,interesting film,"william, pink floyd was actually known as the pink floyd sometimes, and sometimes the pink floyd sound. I've heard it referred to as simply the floyd. it's like changing ted nugent to the nuge, you know what i mean? i've also heard dave gilmour refer to the band as the pink floyd sound.as for the film. i thought it was alright. it was very interesting, but a little confusing and boring sometimes. i enjoyed the music a lot, though."
4,creat cardio/weak toning,"The moves are really complicated for a beginner, and the host screws them up a lot. (she gives instructions to do one thing, and then does another) and the toning w/weights is skimpy, even for a beginner. BUT, the cardio (if you can get the moves down) is great, and short enough to convince yourself that you can make it. I would suggest doing this video and then your own scupting set for arms afterwards. the abs are pretty sufficient as well. and to my surprise, the whooping and hollering is more motivational than annoying."
3,"Not great, not bad","The steps and combinations CAN be a little difficult the first couple of times, and once or twice Lori herself goofs, so that doesn't help.The weight segment is poor, barely a couple of moves before the cardio resumes. If you get the cardio steps, this is a good workout, but I agree with the reviewer who says you have to do your own toning segment.The one girl who does low impact is rarely on camera, or if she is, you can't see her feet, so what's the point?As I said, not a great tape, but not a bad one, it will make you sweat and energize you, and Lori's not irritating at all, when she gets the moves right."
2,not for beginners,"I bought this tape hoping for a quick, good workout. However, the steps aren't broken down well and therefore the tape is difficult to follow. Since the crunch philosophy is for people of various ""shapes, size or ability"", I was expected something better than this. If you're more advanced, don't need to learn by watching the instructor and can learn steps easily, you might like this face-paced video."
1,Stop! Unable to Purchase SSL Certificate.,"As of 11/2009 this product does not support SSL keys bigger than 1024 bits. This is a HUGE problem if you are trying to get a third party SSL certificate from somebody like GoDaddy. You will be unable to get a signed certificate. This is a cool product at a very competitive price, unfortunately this limitation makes it impossible for a business to deploy in a new install. I contacted Netgear support and they confirmed this limitation and had no solution. Do NOT buy this product unless you really understand this serious limitation!! Hopefully Netgear will make a firmware fix or something soon."
1,Outdated,"I bought this in 2008 with the hopes it would solve my network shortcomings. The reality is NetGear abandoned the product and it does not support some versions of XP, it does not work with Vista and certainly not with 7. Do not waste your money. This piece of hardware is all hype and no delivery."
3,Should Have Been Done Better!,"I agree that the old Swedish Pippi Longstocking TV show and the theatrical movies that they made using episodes from that TV show were great and I also wnat to say that they are much better then the American 80's remake and while I don't have a problem with British accents and I actually like British accents I just don't like that the new British accented dubbers used British slang and changed Anika's name to Anna. I mean, what was the deal with that? And since they gave us the original TV show episodes why didn't they also provide the original Swedish with English subtitles?"
1,Sorry - a disappointment,The dubbing is terrible !Obviously room for enhancements - since Pippi will continue forever !If I remember correct the music sounds different even.Ok better than nothing - but I will try to get it from Sweden instead.
1,Not charming at all!,"Since i know the german TV Series, which is nearly double as long as the movies and has a lot more atmosphere and shows more charactere of the three children, i was happy to find at least part of the series in English. But what a mess! The english dubbing is really bad. The Text was somehow adjusted to a more serious, say boring mode. Pippi is not charming at all in this version. For me a lot of the fun and wits is gone. I think the Englsih Movie Version is good and well dubbed, and the better choice. I hope one day the whole TV Series will be released in English."
4,New Dubbing,"I was really turned off by the British dubbing. Tommy, Anika, & Pippi all sound alike and they are so drab. The original dubbing may not have been perfect, but gave the episodes a feeling of fun & excitement. They also call Anika ""Anna"" - I grew up with Pippi and this was a little dissapointing. I gave it 4 stars because the quality is high and perhaps a new generation would find it appealing."
3,THE NEW DUBBING,"(...) THE NEW DUBBING IN NOT RIGHT!! I LOVE PIPPI AND THE WHOLE CHARM OF IT WAS THE BAD AMERICAN DUBBING!! I WAS SOOO HAPPY TO FIND OUT THEY FINALLY RELEASED ALL THE PIPPI'S ON DVD BUT THEN I HEARD THE NEW DUBBING AND WAS VERY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED.. I SOLD IT IMMEDIATELY AND LIVE ON WITH MY PIPPI VHS TAPES!! THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE IT SO YOU HAD A CHOICE OF AMERICAN, BRITISH OR SWEDISH.. I MEAN THEY HAD TO HAVE KNOWN THAT TRUE PIPPI FANS WERE GONNA BE UPSET!!"
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY USED PROPER ENGLISH ACCENTS FOR THE VOICE OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING! And they didn't even use the same English words in most parts. I was looking forward to my daughter being able to enjoy these movies like I did growing up. I was SO disappointed. Someone in America needs to redo this set and offer English subtitles or put the ORIGINAL dubbing BACK IN. (Don't get me wrong , I have NOTHING against the British. I LOVE Britain. It just doesn't work for Pippi.) I will stick with my grainy disintegrating VHS tapes. All I can say is BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"
1,Not at all like the original I grew up with.,This video was bought by myself along with the box set of PiPi. This video is not at all the way it was shown when I was a kid. The voice overs are done over the original voice overs that were first done. They don't even call Annika by her real name they call her Anna. The kids voices have English accents....I do not reccomend this video. I reccomend the box set. The box set is the exact episodes I remember as a kid being showen on regular television with the original voice overs.
2,Pippi Longstocking,"I grew up in Sweden and Pippi was very big when I was a little girl. I was thrilled when I saw that Pippi was translated into english. I wanted my children to be able to understand the movies. The biggest problem I had with the dvd was that the sound was inferior, it was hard to hear what they were saying. The british accent was hard to understand.It was also very annoying that the girl was not called Annicka, like it is in the books and in the real version.If I could have sent this back I would have done so immediately. I would have loved to buy all of Pippi's dvd's, but I will not buy any more in this serie for the fear that they will be the same bad quality."
5,Simple is best!,"Right out of the box, I hooked 2 computers and 1 printer to it, and it works.Important note that applies to all printer sharing switches: Your existing computer-printer is connected using 1 USB A/B cable, and you will need 1 additional A/B cable for each computer you are adding to the switch. In my case, I needed a total of 3 USB A/B cables for this job."
2,"Belkin 4-port USB Switch, May not work with older computers","I purchased this product so that I wouldn't have to keep switching printer cable from one computer to another. Problem is, it doesn't work with my older desktop computer (circa 2004) nor with my work laptop (circa 2006). So, it really doesn't serve its purpose. However, it doesn't pay to return it, between return shipping and 15% restocking fee. I'll just keep it for use in several years when I have a new work computer and replace or eliminate the desktop PC."
4,Simple sollution,"Before this switch, we were using 2 computers and a laptop, all 3 using 1 printer. The problem was the main computer needed to be on for the other 2 to recognize the printer. This is a simple solution for a great price."
5,So convenient!,No more plugging and unplugging the cord! I love it! Keep in mind this product does not include the printer cable.
4,Hedda Gabler,"Hedda gabler is a tale of a woman in the victorian ages. She was recently married to a man who considered writing a book ""The Brabant in the middle ages"" an exiting topic. She is torn between the role she must portray and the role she wants. The play shows the fall from grace and the decline of Hedda Gablers power. It is a powerful play and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Anyone who read the play and wants to help me with a staging essay. amieDicaprio@yahoo.com"
4,Rosenthal is Worth Knowing,"Virtually all of the 42 Maybeck solo piano recitals recorded for Concord are worth acquiring, although some of them are harder to find than others--or more expensive! This recital is no exception. I had never heard Rosenthal until I picked up this album in a cut-out bin in Paris for 5 Euros, but I am glad I bought it. Rosenthal is worth knowing. The program is quite eclectic--Rosenthal even improvises on Bach's ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring""-- but he injects originality into each cut. He's a gifted pianist."
2,dont waste your money,"i did not buy mine through amazon, i bought it right from macys, then replaced it at macys, and i am getting ready to throw it away and buy a different brand. It works great for a month or so, and then one side stops working. i am on my second one. both had the exact same problem. Macys was great with the return policy, but i have not been impress with this brand. especially considering the price. i suggest a different brand."
3,Ended up canceling because it wasn't actually in stock,"I ended up finding one at Tuesday Morning, I think, that was less expensive and had the same features. So far so good. In general I recommend heated mattress pads - they produce gentle steady heat from below, which makes an awful lot of sense. They make getting into bed on a cold winter night a lot more pleasant, especially if you remember to turn them on 10 or so minutes before you climb in!"
5,These could not be cuter!,"I got a pair of these in red. Too cute!! Very comfortable and the price was fantastic. I am a fan of Clarks shoes. They are stylist, comfortable and exhibit quality workmanship."
3,nice knife but...,"I love collectiong blades and daggers, and this one has a very nice design, the blade immitating the flame coming from the drgon. But I was a little disappointed because the blade wasnt sharp."
2,Just by baking papers,I bought these thinking they would be great. I would rather just buy the cute papers and save my money. I used once and won't use them again. They don't stand up very well on there own and they don't come out round.
4,Someone hired Bane to ripen Gotham for the taking-,"Bane makes an appearance in the No Man's Land and Batman must discover his purpose there. Does Bane want to once again be the ""king"" of Gotham? Or is he merely taking advantage of a new opportunity?Someone is making a move and materials are being sent in. There is a light at the end of the No Man's Land tunnel. In addition, Joker and Two-face are still running wild.No Man's Land is a take-no-prisoners look at Gotham if it reverted to the days of feudalism. It is an interesting ""social experiment"" on the part of the writers, and an intriguing plotline."
4,Very nice throttle boss.,"Good looking, comfortable and functional, this throttle boss does exactly what it is supposed to do. Comes with mounting hardware."
3,Good for beginners; some inconsistency,"This book is designed primarily for those who are looking to collect mushrooms for eating purposes. It provides a basic introduction to terminology, but little other scientific information. As a brief guide it is very good; it focuses on common mushrooms found in the midwest. The keys are fairly cursory because of the necessary length constraint, but the discussions of major groups of mushrooms are interesting and fairly informative. There is some minor inconsistency; although the introduction stresses safety (""rule #1; never eat it unless you're 100% sure what it is"") later mushroom descriptions make such broad statements as ""a lactarius with red milk is generally safe."" Applying a little caution, and in conjunction with a more extensive guide, this can be a good resource."
5,I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the coolest game for gbc i play it all day and all night forget what these people say its a sweet game!!!!!!!
2,Skateboarding is fun but not in this game.,"Pick one of the skaters and go skate in a street or vert place. Doesn't sound too good. Well, it isn't. The graphics are horrible (for obvious reasons, its GB color!) and tricks are limited. 4 verts, 3 streets. Just dont get this game."
4,Skating rough!!,"U think 1 was good 2 is so much better!! You can create skaters,park create,and more of a challage.BUY IT!"
5,THE BOMB,"This game is the best ever. I preordered It and It came before I expected it. If you like sports of any kind you should buy this game. I was not a big skateboarding fan before this game. Now I am a nut, I can tell you anything you want to know about it. I played the original where I worked and I loved it. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME. If you played the origonal you can jump right into this game. And the GRAPHICS are amazing on the DC. All the others bow down to the DC version because this game is the daddy of all the other versions. BUY THIS GAME"
5,"BEST GAME FOR DREAMCAST, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT!!!!","This is a wonderful game! Very addicting! I love it,it is so much fun trying to pull out all the tricks to get to the next skatepark! Buy this you will not regret it!"
5,This is the best,Tony out did himself on this one. The levels are off the hook and the graphics are supreme. You can bust just about any trick you can think of and skate with the sickest riders. I highly reccomend this for any avid skateboarding fan.
4,game review,i like this game so much but i think tony hawk pro skater 4 for xbox will be better!!!! must buy. if you a skateboarding fan you should this game or any tony hawk games.the game is great!
4,A great game!,"Awesome game. Just simply put a must buy. I've never done more then pick up a skateboard, yet still enjoyed this game. A lot. Being able to make your own skate park and skateboarder is a ton o' fun, just because you can put your own style into the game. I definitly recommend this game. The only reason I give it only 4 stars, is even though you have a ton of options in this game, it is still a skateboarding game, and to some, that might not be apealing."
5,THE BEST SKATING GAME EVER,This is a great skating game. The graphics are great and the levels are way bigger then they were in the first tony hawk. The tricks are way cooler and there is a lot more to do then in the first one. Even if you are not a big video game fan this is the game to get. If you don't like this game i'd be very surprised. It is cool how you can combine tricks doing a manual to another trick. I definetaly reccomend this game.
5,Must own,"The original Tony Hawk Pro Skater was considered the best extreme sports game if not the best game of all genres. You'd think it'd be hard to improve on the success of the first, but Neversoft did it making a game that's not only larger, but also more rewarding. You have all the original characters plus 3 more, you have more objectives per level, and more secrets to open (get 100% with a character to open up a cheat). Besides that you can now make you're own skater and you're own park and you've got replay value that can't be beat. Add on top of that the new manual move, and you can send your scores through the roof once mastered.It may take a little time to master the controls, but it's easy enough and once you do learn it's almost second nature. I recommed this game to everyone."
4,Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2-pros and cons,"Well in my opinion i think that this game is very fun...but the question is: why do poeple have the advantage of cheats? Yes, there are many pros and cons of the game it self but once you bring the cheats in to it, you basicly get the entire game over with. What is the point of buying a game that costs like [...] and then putting all the cheats into and its over? thats my question...well lets get to the good parts of the game. ON my game i have all of the cheats done but i still am able to save that or not use any of my cheats at all. its fun finishing the level and getting bonus things and you can create your own players...build your own skate parks and much more. My advice to you is buy this game, its very fun and o ahead and get teh cheats if you want right away, but you won't really master the game. This game is one of my favorites...so have your own oppinion but, buy it..yes it is [...] but its worth it.~marisa"
4,Questionable Yet Engrossing,"In the West, we have inverted what we once knew. That the Universe springs from Mind, and not vice versa, used to be a forgone conclusion to the Wise. Now however with Materialism throttling the very life from us, we have forgotten this great Truth and how to live harmoniously in a world where 'Mind is All'. Idealistic and I suppose Hermetic, this book lays down seven principles of the Philosophy that will evoke hopefully something in you that you may have let fall by the wayside. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no real 'proof' these axioms are Hermetic, but they certainly, in my view at least, 'jibe' with the Corpus Hermeticum and still offer up a lot of good Truth."
5,Ancient Kemetic Wisdom Text,"This book, the Kybalion is of the most excellent of words, for it is the very teachings of the Ancient Kemetic(egyptian) God Djehuti, later called Hermes Trismegistus and Thoth by the Greeks. It embodies the Universal laws of Polarity, Causation, The ALL, Mental Gender, etc. These teachings can also be found in other Ancient Kemetic wisdom texts. A very simply written commentary by the authors and it takes years of application and understanding to fully grasp these powerful axioms. A recommended reading for all those who travel along the path to SELF. AB RKH Em AB ""Man, know thyself"" -Ancient Kemetic axiom."
5,The rest of the story,The Kybalion is the missing link that fillls in the gap between the wisdom of the ancients and religious bullcrap (mind control) of modernday religions . The ancients observed the world around them and used information to help better themseylves .The Kybalion illustrates how much the ancients had observed and applied the info they acquired . The ancients built and achieved great things without the aid of modern machines because they KNEW things and lived according to the Laws of the Universe .We all should be studying this book from age nine onwards .Maybe then we could see the rest of the Humanity story that so far has puzzled all of us .
5,Love the ancient works,I have recently had a thirst for ancient wisdom literature and this fills that bill. All the way from the ancient Egypian to what this might mean for us today -- this interest of mine -- has been piqued by this book. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to know more about him/herself and the world in which we live.
3,Interesting,"Written a hundred years ago, it still reads as a contemporary work. No sentences a paragraph long, thank goodness. Typical of many esoteric works the language has a 'superior' feel to it, giving the impression that those who wrote it and those who read it are somehow superior to the normal, 'unevolved' person. Rather a turn off but nevertheless interesting enough. Prescriptive as to how the universe works but I suppose that's the point. It's a small work and not difficult to digest. Will go back and read again no doubt as the journey continues and the path unfolds before me. Worth a look if only for yet another point of view."
5,Very profound and wonderfully insightful!,"Know now that this is the study of Hermetics in as pure a form as can be found anywhere in the literary world. This book should be read in portions and digested accordingly. This book deals with some of the more abstract form of occult philosophy. This book attempts to explain Hermetics to the layman and does a wonderful job. Anyone who can claim a first read understanding of the principles discussed in this book without having studies philosophy or Hermetics before might be fooling himself. This is a VERY DEEP book for being so small. I found it enlightening and a pleasure to read. Even if this book was a forgery, it still conveys the same principals as would an origional manuscript. This book is believable. I enjoyed it."
5,Illumination Even For Beginners,"A very strange little book this, it was lent to me by a good friend and I thought it would take am weekend to read! At the time I failed to understand his analogy of the book to that of an onion. Now I understand. When you read this book you will abosrb a tiny fraction of the material and each time you choose to re-read a chapter, it's as if whole paragraphs are revealed to you for the firts time - a bit like removing successive layers from an onion skin. I find this book to be a foundation for any magik and although perhaps not easily understood in places, the more it is read, somehow the more you are allowed to understand. I now have had to return the book and am about to purchase a copy for myself. I agree with the others, it will be the best $14 I have spent for a very long time. A superb work and an absolute must for any collection worthy of the name."
4,Interesting read,Those interested in esoteric wisdom may find this fascinating. Not really for the Christian who believes that God is made in man's image. They may find it difficult to wrap their minds around the idea that God is the All and that we are but a dream.
5,The Kybalion,I have been studying Hermetics and this book was just what I needed. It was in great condition and arrived promptly.
5,The Kybalion,"This book is a must for any serious student of spirituality, I read this book as a teen and did not appreciate it, recently I decided to purchase a copy and reread it, I found myself having many Neo moments, I would read a little paragraph and go whoaaaaaaaa like when Morpheous showed Neo how to jump across the building with out hitting the pavement lol. I find myself savoring the words and nodding my head in agreement. the Kybalion is something that is inherent in man/woman his/her spirituality and their connection with the mental universe. it put into words what I had always felt deep in my soul and at this stage in my spiritual evolution I can appreciate it and be filled with hope for humans and this planet once again."
3,Pretty thoughts,"Pretty thoughts and scene development and some hard abstractions are dealt with, but nothing jumps up and bites the reader with its newness."
5,Criterion release,"Don't spend your money on an overpriced used copy of this masterpiece film. Sources say that the Criterion Collection will be releasing this film in the near future, to be announced. It will be worth the wait."
5,James Mason is the best,"This is a fantastic film noir, one of the few from Britain that can be said to be up there with the very best. A tight, taut storyline grips from the outset, the cinematography is superb, and the performances dazzle; especially Mason, an actor of very rare quality in an extremely convincing portrayal. See it if you can."
3,Great looking film starts of well but goes astray about half way through,"Beautifully photographed and strikingly directed film about an IRA robbery gone wrong starts well. About halfway through, however, the wounded protagonist meets a priest, a crazy old man, and a mad artist and the whole thing goes awry. The scene with the priest is long and boring and the film grows more and more pretentious before building to the predictable conclusion. James Mason has little to do as the rebel other than stumbling around and he just seems a little too urbane to play a tough guy anyway."
4,"Good, but not perfect","This, above all other books of this type, seems to have the best combination of information about foods generic & otherwise. I still am left to guess at some things. But, let's face it, if you have a piece of homemade chocolate cake, with chocolate buttercream frosting, you KNOW that the listing in a calorie counter will probably be lower than what you really consumed. Common sense, and an honest appraisal to what you're eating is necessary no matter what reference you use."
2,old,"This book was advertised as ""new"" and it is not. The pages are yellow and it was published 7 years ago. Out dated and disappointing."
5,Great Book!,"Thanks, for the quick service. My husband likes the book quite well & finds it an easy read & easy to find what ones looking for."
5,A good source of calorie Counts,This book gives a good calorie count to most common items and they are easy to locate
1,THREE PERFECT DAYS IN HONOLULU,WATCHING THIS FILE DID NOT SHOW THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF THE ISLAND.INSTEAD IT WAS MORE ON THE MORE EXPENSIVE PALCES TO DINE AND RESORTS TO STAY AT. MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THE TYPE LUX. THAT THIS FILE PORTRAYS. WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS FILE.
2,Attempts to create a new world and fails.,"I mean its fantasty but giant lizards living in the far coasts? The Story also involved magic and offered no point to how people got that way or how they use it. It also took lot of shortcuts, oh the decides to sneak aboard the ship so she can go with her husband. The lizard dudes are also never really explained, they just are there to add excitement and to attempt to make this stand out among other fantasty books.It doesn't. He took time to describe the characters, but did anyone really care what happened to Garth? Or all of the drunk sailors? Not me. My reaction after a sailor was killed was, ""Ow that would suck to die that way."" It should be ""Oh, no don't kill off that guy! NO!"" Thats how I was when reading The Hobbit.Overall Chris Bunch basically threw in a little horror a little Sci-Fi, some fantasty, and some adventure and hoped it would work.It didn't."
1,Unimaginative Tale of Nothing,Corsair brings the reader into a land of empty characters and a humdrum plot. The world Bunch endeavors to create is nothing short of undeveloped and lacking any sort of ingenuity. I felt he just sat down and randomly wrote until he reached a certain amount of pages and then decided to stop. Was there even an editing process in this book? I do not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for mindless empty drivel to fill their head.
2,Horatio Hornblower in a fantasy novel.,"This book is more a collection of adventures than a single story. It's very heavy on the nautical and very light on the fantasy. The focus is almost entirely on the hero, with only a few other characters who function mostly as a cheering section for the hero. Go to sea, come back a success. Go to sea on a bigger ship, come back more successful, etc. Not totally awful, just not very interesting."
2,Covered too much ground.,The first half was going good.But something happened on the way home. This book needed fewer plots or more time. Had some good ideas.Another waste of time.
5,Crawlspace Rocks!,"Box office favorite and perennial villian KLAUS KINSKI stars in this horrifying and gruesome thriller as a crazed maniac who is obsessed with traping young women and then slowly torturing them to death.Karl Guenther (KINSKI) is a conscientious landlord who looks out for his young and attractive tenants. Jessica, the rising young soap opera star, Harriet, a sensuous and vivacious secretary and Sophie, an accomplished pianist who enjoys wild fantasy sex with her boyfriend...all live in Karl's well kept apartments. The only discord is the ""tap, tap, tap"" sound at night from the crawlspace above their rooms. Karl tells them it's rats, but in reality it is Karl spying on them. One by one the tenants become his victims...each one put to a gruesome test. Only one tenant remains to disclose the diabolical Karl and she enters the crawlspace-she is alone with a madman capable of anything!Enter CRAWLSPACE...and enter a new dimension of terror!"
1,please don't waste your time,This movie should have been left in the crawlspace. Please don't even bother free don't mean good. it's free for a reason.. move on
2,Deceiving cover!,"My roommates and I just watched this movie on instant video. I was bummed that the cover was a little misconceiving as to the content of the film. I didn't enjoy the set design, characters, or plot that much, but the soundtrack was cool. The peeping tom aspect (I feel like there is a lot homage to the film Peeping Tom) was interesting, but I feel like it was downplayed by the fact that the killer is a nazi murderer. Anyway, it's kind of fun to watch."
1,complete waste of time,one of the worst films i've ever viewed. not even worth making fun of. avoid this one.
4,A Cuban detective story,"This is a story about a corpse that goes missing, a Chinese corpse, and a policeman who is called out of early retirement to solve the case because it is harmful to Chinese-Cuban relations. It is also about the mistrust between a priestess of Santeria, an Africa-derived religion, and her brother, a priest. It is about stolen goods, and drug trafficking, the Chinese Revolution, and the machismo of the policeman. As well as the Abakua secret society, and a Chinese secret society. And Palo Monte, a magical practice. For all these things, it is an interesting and unique book, set in Cuba, in and near to Havana. It is well-written, engaging, and a mystery to the end. It is also hard to follow because there are too many characters and too many story lines."
3,One Size Fits All?,"I sure am tired of products being sold as ""ONE SIZE FITS ALL"" when they don't. I wear a size 8 hat (not even close to the largest sizes by the way) and the clic readers do not fit. When I put them on, they are so tight my eye lashes rub the lenses when I blink!That being said, these are extremely well made glasses and their design is great and useful (if it fit...that is). The lenses are crystal clear and first rate. Get with the program clic and offer a larger version! And quit advertising ""One Size Fits All"" because this is just not true!"
3,Check the SIZE,"Conventional glasses usually work fine but these go completely around the head. Measuring over the ears and across the bridge of the nose, they are about 23 inches at their smallest and about 24 1/2 inches at the largest. The total adjustment is about 1 1/2 inches. Another 1/2 inch and they would have been fine as it is, they were returned."
2,Not big enough,"I didn't think I had that large of a head, the closed loop of these glasses, and the limited adjustability made my purchase impossible to use.Good quality construction, but definitely for those with small heads."
2,not what I was expecting,Sent them back. Was not what I was expecting. The head band part is ridged and not flexable. Uncomfortable over ears and forget about having a ponytail in because it will not fit over or under one.
2,Clic,I was very disappointed in the Clic Readers. The glasses themselves were great butI purchased them for my wife and she will hardly use them because the strap was tooshort. Even after adjusted all the way out. So now she has a pair that are kept in the drawer and will never be used.
2,Two small,"Good concept. Like others who have reviewed the product, it is just a little too small for my big head so the glasses jam up against my eyeballs particularly when I bend my head back. Too bad because I so wanted this to work for me."
3,Clic Reader,I gave these to my husband for Father's Day. They do not adjust enough to fit his head and thus keep popping apart. He hates them. Only uses them when he doesn't have another pair available.Probably would work find for a female.
2,needs more adjustment,The extention on the arms is not long enough to fit my head.It needs to come out about another inch or two.That would give you more of an adjustment.Do you have another size? I would be glad to swap .
2,Clic Adjustable Readers - Don't Fit Well,"I was very disappointed with the way the glasses fit. I was away when the glasses arrived. When I returned, I found that I missed the deadline in sending them back."
3,Tiny,"Pretty cool product, but they were soooo small. Even extended to full length they didnt fit. I would recommend these for only the narrowist faces. I'm a larger guy, but they were even a little smallish on my teenager."
1,Good idea that needs work,"These glasses were recommended by a man. I didn't find them to be as practical as he did, because they get caught in my long hair. They don't look particularly attractive on me, partly because they don't fit very well. I'm returning them in favor of my ""drugstore"" readers."
4,love the readers hate the logo,"I really like these readers. At work I move around a lot because of the short loop they are always handy and they don't get in the way. The ""CliC"" logo on the back doesn't bother me, but do they really need to etch their logo into the outer edge of the lens. I like their product but I don't like being a walking advertisement for them. If I'm looking over the top of the lens for distance and glance down to read it can actually interfere with my reading field of vision. C'mon guys."
5,clic glasses,"These are the best pair of reading glasses on the market. I have 2 pair, one for work one for home and would never get any other kind of readers."
3,CliC Reading Glasses,Nice product although one size does not fit all. You can make it work though. The nice thing is the convenience of not having to lay them down or put them in your pocket.
