2,Disappointing,"Rod Stewart is a great singer. His hits are timeless, but he can't sing the classics. His voice si not designed for the slower songs. He appears to be rather monotoneous and does not sound at all lke his other albums. Unless this is playing very low in the background, it does not sound very good."
5,Surprise Number Two,"This album wasn't really surprise number two. Volume I of Stewart's Great American Songbook was a wonderful surprise! Prior to it, I had always thought of Rod Stewart as a successful, raspy-voiced rock star whose songs usually exhibited excellent music and accompaniment. In Volume I, he showed he can deliver some classics masterfully.Volume II picks up where Volume I left off. Great selection of songs, great accompaniment and great delivery. One can easily detect the influences of Billie Holiday, Sam Cooke and Ella Fitzgerald.Great songs, great music, great accompaniment, great delivery. Bound to be another success."
4,as time goes by,"I didnt like Rod stewart until he started singing the oldies,but I dont think this one is as good as his first one."
3,On second thought......,"You know, I too am one of those who long ago wrote off Rod Stewart, probably around the time ""Do You Think I'm Sexy"" hit the airwaves. Why? Bcause his early work with Ron Woods / Faces, and his solo albums were such blues and rock tour-de-forces, I -- like may others -- hated to see such raw, expressive talent go to waste. So, when I found out he had switched to covering tunes from the Great American Songbook, my first response was ""Whatever...I certainly won't be adding them to my music collection."" Then, I heard his and Cher's rendition of ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered."" To my surprise, it actually works! Plus, they sound like they were having a great time while recording it. So, while I'm not fully pursuaded by Rod Stewart's recent career path, I'm willing to give this cd another chance."
5,creates the mood,This is a great CD to have on while entertaining. It helps create a relaxing and yet up-beat mood.
3,Good; a few not so memorable songs,"The first song of the CD, ""Time after Time"", is the highlight of this album. Delivered picture perfect by Mr. Stewart. I find myself skipping back to the beginning of this CD just to hear it again and again. The two duets (with Cher and Queen Latifah), could have come out better. Duets are meant to come across as two different voices somehow meshing into one. These two songs come across as a little disconnected. A good CD, but doesn't qualify as one of the great ones."
1,"Old Rock And Rollers never die, they just flash back...","Right, Rod...what next? TV ads for green polyester leisure suits?"
1,Not Happy,I ordered this item thru Amazon but with another company. I never received the album and could not get them to respond to my e-mails.I finally called Amazon and they refunded my money. Amazon is a stand up company; just don't get envolved with and of there sub companys.I've since ordered many things from Amazon and usually can't believe how fast they get things to me.
5,Grabs your heart!,"This is by far the best CD I have purchased in a very long time! I play it all day at work, over and over again. Rod Stewart has come into his own with these beautiful songs..and he has the most soothing, wonderful voice. Every song is a joy to listen to!! I would recommend this to everyone..."
1,Leave our favorites alone,It doesn't take much to describe this album-AWFUL-Stay on your side of the pond-you're humiliating yourself for money!
1,This is NOT the real Rod Stewart,"For the REAL Rod Stewart, go listen to his: Maggie May, You Wear It Well, Reason To Believe, You're In My Heart, Tonight's The Night, Every Picture Tells a Story, Mandolin Wind. THAT is talent! But this? This?! It's a shame he prostituted his wonderful talent in transforming the American Standards on this CD into a miserable compilation of heartless, soul-less, saccharine drivel."
1,Painfully Bad,"I love Rod Stewart, so I bought this CD. Bad decision. This CD could be played on ""The Annoying Music Show"". Sounds forced, graceless. A terrible disappointment."
1,"Fine music, but corrupted CD","Sure like to be able to play this music. Saw Rod on tele and it sounded fine, but... I obtained it from a local dealer and people beware: this cd is corrupted by copy control, which means I can not play it on my 'cheap' SONY 333ES cd player and my 'very cheap' Marantz sacd SA17. I really do not need this crap and just want to say to everyone: do not buy this cd or any other corrupted cd of the label BMG. They are hitting on the people who pay for their music and this does not seem fair. I feel robbed."
4,Well done,"I've enjoyed Rod Stewart in the past -- I bought this after having seen Rod stand in with Paul and crew on Letterman recently. He was great. I love these songs (a major draw), and he does them justice. I'm glad I purchased it."
1,The Great American Songbook: Volume II just plain STINKS!,"Here were go, again. If CD Number One was bad, this is worse.Rod Stewart's interpretation of these classic standards is once again, thoroughly inept. I can't understand who this CD would appeal to, except for people who have no concept of what big band music was about, or jazz.Do yourself a favor. Instead of buying this album, buy a copy of Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits instead. Sinatra has a much stronger voice, and sings many of these same songs the way they were meant to be heard."
1,"A sloppy, soulless, cynical, commercial strategy.","To paraphrase Woody Allen, one might call this a travesty of a mockery of a sham of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham.Buy a Shirley Horn record."
1,Emperor's New Clothes Redux,"I do love many of Rod's old hit songs, but he can't sing the great standards on this CD as well as they should be sung. His Louis Armstrong voice is too harsh for many of the songs. I'll concede that some singing styles take a while to grow on you. For example, I now love Cyndi Lauper's ""At Last"" CD and the way she uniquely covers every song with a powerhouse rock voice, and I've learned to like Joni Mitchell's completely changed husky vocals. Unfortunately, because of those two revisionist singers, I didn't realize that I should first listen to this Rod Stewart CD before shelling out money for it. He did pick fabulous songs, and to give him credit, he enunciates well so that every lyric is crystal clear. The orchestra is great. But his voice lacks the mellowness that these classics deserve."
1,Rod is gone forever,I honestly thought this was some kind of joke recording. What a total embarassment! I saw the TV commercial for this piece of crap a while ago and Rod looks like an old drunk. Rod's work with Jeff beck and the Faces was GREAT! How can he stoop so low?
1,This album is pathetic,"I do not need to buy this album in order to review it: unfortunately, its being played all the time everywhere I go. I like the songs, themselves.. but Rod Stewart's rendition is about as genuine and soulful as a bum's rendition on the subway. He sounds like someone who has chain smoked for 50 years and thinks the background music can cover for him. Lee Scratch Perry is another oldie who doesn't sound all that hot either anymore - but at least he has a great show, is a fantastic writer & producer (and what is Rod exactly?)...plus you KNOW he's stoned."
1,Awful,"Listening to Rod Stewart singing ""Someone to Watch over Me,"" is like watching someone like Kenny Rogers in a Shakespearean performance, or Richard Simmons try to reach the hoop in a slamdunk contest with Michael Jordan. Stewart is simply way out of his element.As someone who started his career singing rock/blues songs with bonafide musicians like Jeff Beck, Stewart has really forgotten his roots. Stewart's voice is painfully paper-thin, and somehow, Stewart manages to sound like jazz voacalist Ann Richards.This CD is something that Clive Davis or some A&R; guy dreamed up to sell CD's to woefully ignorant boomers who think that Stewart's doing something new. Do yourself a favor and buy any CD by Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennet instead.This CD only serves as proof that most popular music is garbage."
1,As Time goes by...The Great American Songbook: Volume II,"I was very disappointed to receive only a CD, when the title clearly states ""The Great American Songbook : Volume II. I expected a book with lyrics and music along with the CD. I am very upset about not having the notes and words written like they would be in a songbook. You are mis-leading people when you advertise a songbook and it is nothing but a CD and the lyrics are written on a little booklet. I would not reccomend this to anyone.Wanda McIver"
3,The sequel is not as strong as the original.,"I really enjoyed The Great American Songbook: Volume 1 (five stars). I have been a long time fan of Rod Stewart and was caught by surprise by how effective his stylings and his style were a perfect match to the songs. Volume 2 does not have the same engaging feel, but I can't blame it on the song selection. Quite simply, there is too much orchestration and not enough Rod. The duets add little to the CD other than the promise of novelty and interest. The CD is good, but I know that I will still be playing more of Volume 1 than of Volume 2 until the next sequel appears on shelves."
1,A Has Been Who Never Was.,"Rod Stewart has not done an original album in years. He now relies on doing ""old standards"" with a voice that sounds like running your nails down a chalk board. Lazy, lazy , lazy. Time has more than passed you by and shows what talent you had, left years ago."
1,There are fundamental things that don't apply...,"What did Linda Ronstadt start so long ago with her ""Lush Life"" album? How many pop stars have since recorded collections of standards? Everyone from Toni Tennile to Cyndi Lauper. Of course Linda, Toni and Cyndi had something in common -- lovely, radiant voices and -- to varying degrees -- a stylistic grasp of what these songs require. Rod has no voice and no style, and listening to this nightmare of a CD is like getting your ears flossed with barbed wire. I saw him perform one of these numbers on the Today Show and I never saw a performer look so embarrased and forlorn. Even Rod knows this is a dreadful mistake."
5,Rod rises?,"Have both of these respectful cd's. Lover of these old standards, I thouroughly enjoy them equally. Rod has risen to present these great classics similar to the 2 albums by Linda Rondstadt back in the 80's when she payed similar homage to the late, great, Nelson Riddle.Kudos to Rod. Hope to see a Trilogy."
1,What a Rip-Off!,"If you want to hear a *great* CD with these songs, sung by someone with more talent and style than Rod Stewart, check out the CD ""As Time Goes By"" from Bryan Ferry. Stewart is just ripping off Ferry, who did these same songs about two years earlier - and did them better. Stewart does not have the class or elegance to sing these songs. Thumbs down!"
1,Oh my this is bad,"Rod Stewart lacks the style and heart to make these songs his own. What made performers like Sinatra great was they truly emboldened the songs they sang with a depth and character. They made them their own. Rod Stewart is just a stand in who doesn't contribute anything new to the performance of this music and his signature voice simply kills legendary hits like ""I'm In The Mood For Love"".This album isn't about bringing a new vision to the performance of these classics. It's about Rod Stewart trying to milk one last cent out of a fading career. If you want to enjoy a modern restyling of great jazz and vocal favorites, pickup any CD from Diana Krall. She delivers soulful, extraordinary performances in the tradition of Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Torme, Nancy Wilson, Ertha Kitt, and Frank Sinatra. That's how it's supposed to be done."
1,ONE STAR FOR STEWART; FIVE FOR THE SONG TITLES,"With so much great talent out there, one wonders why anyone pays bucks to listen to the falsetto sandpaper voice of a re-tread who's ruining beautiful standards. (Stewart sounds like he needs a high colonic.) Better to spend your money on Michael Buble, Steve Tyrell, Harry Connick or Joe Williams singing the standards....or simply save your money, dust off that good ol' Sinatra, Dean Martin or Sammy Davis Jr.CD and enjoy!"
1,"Gee, where'd he get the idea for this?","Two albums of this stuff, and, by remarkable coincidence, exactly 50% of the songs are ones that were previously--and most of them recently!--covered by lesser-known but far more talented Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music, who got a Grammy nomination for his similar--and earlier!--CD. Sure, anyone can record these songs, but the significant duplication strongly suggests that Ferry had an idea that Rod thought he could better capitalize on. Spare yourself the soulless Stewart crooning. If you want a modern pop singer doing authentic but fresh renditions, buy Bryan Ferry instead."
4,Definitely Good,"I notice a lot of reviewers are referencing Rod Stewart's older music. As a teenager, I'm not familiar with much of it (""Tonight's the Night"" and ""Have I Told You Lately That I Love You"", maybe), so this is pretty much uninfluenced by Rod Stewart the artist.While I know most of these songs, there were a few I didn't know, and overall I think Rod did a great job introducing them to me. The best word of which I can think to describe the way he sings is ""caress"", because he truly does caress the notes and makes the melody richer by doing so. There are instrumental solos on almost all of the songs (check the clarinet solo on ""Crazy She Calls Me""), and they're all beautiful as well. I listened to this CD nonstop during Christmas break.At the end of the day, it's a good CD. I don't think it's especially remarkable, but it's very good and I enjoy listening to it a lot."
2,"Was expecting much more, didn't get it!!!!!","I love Rod Stewart, but this Album does not do him justice! Darnit, picked it up this morning, and am dissapointed!"
2,"Fair to middling,and thats being polite","I have never really liked his voice,and this does nothing to sway me. Nothing new here ,sadly just another grab at commercialism after the surprise success of the first American songbook.Isn`t he British anyway?? What`s with the patriotic crap to America? One American songbook you could forgive, but two ?? Come on Rod. If you`re going to resort to 40`s and 50`s ''classics'' , do an English one for pity`s sake. You were '' made in England after all'', as your fellow compatriate Elton John once sang."
4,Rod can still swing it....,"My first thought when I heard Rod doing the 'songbook' was not a pleasant one. But, I have to say this is nice choice of song. By him (and his management team) seeing the need to do this music, he will allow great new young singers like Michael Buble to emerge.Keep swinging Rod, and keep pushing the envelope."
3,"Rod isn't the best for standards,cher is","Rod Stewarts thin aging voice has some resonance, but fails to have the support to give these standards the body they deserve. This is all put aside when Cher does her thing on ""Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered"".Cher shows color strength and depth, and Rod compliments her on that one.Queen Latifah does a good job as well. The duets are the high point on the cd.Let's hear Cher do her standard cd. She's a perfect american stylist.Brits are wonderful but sing standards with less authenticity!"
5,As time goes by....we get nostalgic !,"Stewart lends his unique vocal style to some traditional pop classics.AS TIME GOES BY....VOLUME 2 is the second effort from ROD to embrace a more ""romantic / mature"" musical production. This volume is as succesful as last year's product. If you enjoyed Volume 1 do not hesitate to compliment your collection with this addition.This year, Stewart should once again recieve yet another GRAMMY NOMINATION for his artistry on this CD."
3,"I wanted Rod Stewart, not....","I wanted Rod Stewart, who is great at these standards. I did not want duets with Cher or Queen Latifah! It's not that I don't like those two women, but I like them individually, as I do Rod Stewart. Those two songs I had to edit out of the play list. :-("
1,From Bad to Worse,"May future generations judge Rod by his Mercury recordings and not Round II of this latest sell-out. This is just bad. Check out any of his recordings between ""The Rod Stewart Album"" and ""Smiler"" for an idea of how great this singer once was."
2,Disappointed,"I am so disappointed with this CD. I have been a Rod Stewart fan my whole life, but his voice sounds so gravely and strained. Love the songs, but just not Rod singing them. Sorry!!!!"
1,"""Music Fan"", Please. . .","You must be politically conservative as well, being that an opinion other than yours is met with such derision. For your information, I am completely grown up, maybe even older than you, and I have been listening to music, from Pavarotti to Pearl Jam, all of my life. I know what I like and I know what I don't like, and one thing I don't like is some broken-down hack wheezing through a dead-horse catalog of ditties that was second rate to begin with. THAT IS MY OPINION, and I don't pretend it's anything else. ""Real music"", at least by your interpretation (to me, ALL music is ""real"", whether I like it or not) is in the ear of the beholder, and I for one don't carve my opinions in stone. Anyway, anyone who reaches the conclusion, based on the songwriters I listed in my review, that my tastes run to hip hop and rap, can't be taken all that seriously. Enjoy the CD, and think before you talk (or write)."
1,Great American Songbook by Rod Steward,"CD arrived with scratch. Seller advised rubbing toothpaste in it; if that didn't work, he'd send another. It didn't; I notified him but never heard from him again. I wrote again, asking for replacement. Still nothing. Jo"
3,Lonely Planet World Food India,"This is a lovely, colorful and attractive book full of interesting information about Indian culture and daily living.However, I was disapointed that it had just a few recipes as it is really more of a travel/guide book. I returned the book because I wanted a cook book, not a guide book. But if you want a guide book, you will be pleased."
2,"Some good information, but waaaaay watered down","This book is 692 pages and, I swear, it could be 69. The chapters are very tedious to read, though there is some useful information in it and ideas that anyone interested in the topic needs to know, but it seems like there'd have to be a more interesting and less repetitive (not to mention cheaper) way to do it. Typical dry, dry, dry textbook (the sole exception being the accounts by real people of their experiences with family members with special needs..those were very interesting and moving)."
1,The Photo Of the Book,One would have to question the cover of the authors book before even purchasing his work. when has the first image portrayed on the cover ever been illustrated as a lighter skinned person. The original displayed the illustrated the Kemetian as black skin like the second character from the left with slightly different garments. On the authors cover he has the Kemetian as light skin with feathers in his head wearing an old world french styled beard. It would be nice to have the author and illustrator comment on how and what one should interpret from this new design and it's meaning.
2,Cute...but not useful!,"I own this exact style and color and it doesn't work for my baby and I. I think in order to use this kind of carrier, you have to know the exact measurements of it in order to buy the one which fits your body type as a glove, otherwise it's so impossible to adjust or to put it on. My daughter also is not comfortable in it at all (especially her neck and as you can see in the model picture: the baby's legs are not in the comfortable position...). It's just SUPER complicated to use. It's difficult to put or take the baby in or out of it. I don't have that kind of patience and time to practice in order to make it work. It's cute but not useful at all to me. I ended purchase the BabyBjorn carrier instead. It's much more expensive but worth every penny and more COMFORTABLE for both of us with great support for my back... and my baby is as close to my chest as she can be. If you have the kind of time to practice using it, go for it but no thanks for me."
4,Recommended for use in college comp. sci. courses!!!,"As a tutor at a fairly sizable university, I have encouraged many of my students (especially ""adult students"") to use this and other Dummies books to help them get a grip. While WP 6.1 is simple for many of us, folks without some PC time under their belts see it as a different language! This book will allow them to at least be able to communicate with others in the campus computer lab"
3,I was charged double shipping!!,"The product was great but I would never buy anything from the seller, Newbury Comics Inc. I ordered both CDs from one seller in order to save money on shipping fee. Both CDs arrived in one package but I was charged the shipping fee TWICE. I e-mailed teh seller and asked for explanation but received none. The customer service person tried to convince me that this is the company policy and offered no logical reasoning for charging double shipping on one package. Just be careful when dealing with Newbury Comics Inc."
5,Totally Engaging,"This book grabs you with the very first line and doesn't let go. Although I hadn't planned to, I read it straight through; it was just that compelling. In addition to providing practical advice to people confronting their own issues, the book is an extremely entertaining read because of the authors' humor and wit. Very inspiring."
1,Standstill,This book is a hard to read book. I just haven't been able to get through it and I am not sure I will. I do admire Carlana for all she has been through with greatness.
5,Biography / Self-help,"I'm a recent college grad, and believe that I am going through the stage called the ""Quarterlife Crisis."" I'm trying to find myself, and make sense of what is happening with me, and around me during these first few years of my twenties. I saw this book while I was vacationing in Anchorage, Alaska, and I flipped through it because the title of the book caught my eye. This book is not only about Carlana's struggle with her disability, but I especially like the self-help exercises that she included after each chapter. They make you examine your life, and realize that you cannot stop living no matter how tough life can be. Although this book has some grammatical errors and omitted words, Carlana's overall message is helping me to understand that I need to keep going, and to accept the challenges that life brings."
5,Great Book,"I ordered this book, for I seen it in a plane and pilot magazine. The author of this book, who is disabled, is not only a disabled young woman, but she is a pilot too. I thought it was awesome that someone had went beyond the odds for herself and never stopped believing in herself. Great book."
5,Beautiful Pastels,"Envelopes are Quality. Able to fit a 9""hx7""w magazine safely folded in half. Paper is semi-silky and strong. Colors are Soft. Pretty Pink, buttery Ivory, mint Green, powder Blue, light Grey and sunny Yellow. Laser & Inkjet Gtd. Under $5. Envelopes are ""Green Seal"" certified. 30% recycled."
1,not a good mixed cd,The remixes arent that great and didnt have any original sound or beats didnt give me that feeling of remembering Expose the group their sound
4,Nice and Tender Jazz,This Notable recording has many Honorable cuts and many more Honorable mentions for cuts. One can feel their heritage coming through along with growth as jazz musicians.
3,Poor Detail.,"This book is a good idea and provides some interesting ideas, but is low on detail and the pictures aren't that spectacular either.I bought is as a package with Cheng's ""Concrete Countertops"" which I highly recommend.I'd pass on this book."
4,"If you love concrete houses, you should see this book","It's a great overview of beautiful concrete houses, most of which I had never seen before. BUT, I have to say that they authors did disappoint me on one level; PICTURES! The pics are good, but they could have been SO MUCH BETTER. I'm constantly left wondering what the rest of a house looks like. Entire pages are devoted to single pictures (of staircases and the like) when they should have had an abundance of views. Overall, I do love this book, and you probably will too."
3,Interesting Homes,This book could easily have been 4 times as thick to cover all that needs to be covered when it comes to concrete architecture but it does give the reader a good idea of what can be done with concrete when it comes to home building. If your into concrete architecture then this book will give you a glimpse of homes that you won't find in any other books.
5,"Despite the odd title, one of the best of the Mars novels","I found this book very engaging. Of course, you have to make allowances for the writer's style-- the book was written in the late 1920's. Synthetic Men had some of the best (scariest) monsters and one of the best plots of the eleven Burroughs Barzoom (Mars) novels. Ras Tharvas, the wicked scientist, is always a hoot. But the story has a serious tone as a young man in love is desperately trying to save his sweetheart from a terrible fate -- marriage to a Hitler-like emperor-criminal. He becomes a monster to reach her and save her, but she's terrified of him, naturally. How he works all this out, stymies the wicked guys, and gets the girl, is quite a heck of a read!"
4,More swashbuckling on the Red Planet,"Swordfighting, chivalry, adventure, shambling bad guys, noble good guys, and the odd princess or two. You know, the usual. Complete with inane romantic frustration and misunderstandings, resolved happily but chastely in the end. You know, the usual.This time the heoric rescues come as thick and fast as ever. The romantic misunderstanding are compounded by a brain transplant or two, leaving our love-lorn thoroughly and disgustingly disguised as he moons about the object of his slightly confused passion.Count on Burroughs for good, solid, illogical adventure: swords and zap guns across the drying ocean floor of a dying Mars. They just don't make them like this any more.-- wiredweird"
4,"Abook once started , hard to put down",Came across this book by Judy Leden aa a present from my wife after attending a talk by the author.I found it got more compelling as I read into the book. She found a way of mixing technical details whilst still giving a good adventure read. I felt as if I was flying with her on the altitude record drop.
3,"Toddler says, ""meh"" to this one","My bookworm toddler loves Spot lift-the-flap books....but this one just doesn't catch her attention. The story is a bit long for her ateention span, I guess, and the text underneath the flaps might be a bit much for her right now (she's 17 months old). Maybe she'll warm up to it when she's a little older. The story itself is sweet; Spot trying to bake his Daddy a cake, with the usual cute messes along the way. And the cake...well, he is a preschool puppy, right? :)"
2,"If there's one thing this is, it's a book","Cranfield and Moy do manage to get across a few useful facts and strategies for straight pool, but there's really nothing new here. Not only is the content of the book fairly weak, it's also full of technical inaccuracies. Considering the level of play that Cranfield was at, it's interesting to note that he apparently has no grasp whatsoever of the actual effects of english and throw. While a good player of any of the other cuesports might find this a useful introduction to the strategy of straight pool, I think a beginner may find this book does irreparable harm to his understanding of basic fundamentals."
1,"Nothing new here: 'Bible' redundant, old hat","Pool players: if you are anything above a low C player than this book is really a waste of time, and exposes no unique opinions/strategies/skills/drills that you will find useful. Basically the book rides on the coattails of the authors' professional achievements; sadly these do NOT bring with them a knack for either teaching OR writing, as sorely evidenced in this thin texts' lack of content. Time would be better spent with Cappelle, Fels and Koehler. These three will say all this book says and much, much more. Good luck with your runouts...."
2,A very mixed bag,"Covers some aspects of Straight Pool...but never in enough depth or clarity. More worth your money are Capelle's ""Play your Best Straight Pool"" (everything you can imagine about the game) and Fels' classic ""Advanced Pool"" (not quite as in depth as Capelle, but with good sections on the mental aspect of pool, plus several racks analyzed shot by shot). To be perfectly honest, I junked Babe's book a month after buying it; I simply had no use for it alongside better books like the above-mentioned."
4,very strong,"sometimes hard to separate the movie and the act and the relationship, but Glen Hansard's work is classic singer songwriter stuff."
3,"""Sleeping"" MP3 download is defective","Overall, I like this CD but the second track, ""Sleeping,"" is incomplete and ends abruptly in the middle of a sentence."
3,The best CD ive heard in along time!,"After seeing the movie ""once"" I new I had to have all the stuff these two have made together and I highly recommend both CDS and the movie too! I listen to them every day!"
1,Hansard CD,This is second CD I have purchased of Hansard and Marketa.First was soundtrack of the movie ONCE. I believe it is rated byNew Yorker in top hundred best sound tracks of films Just beautiful.
4,Once CD repeat,"I love the Once soundtrack, but must agree that this CD is a disappointment and offers not enough new songs to purchase. If you've got the soundtrack, you've got enough."
4,Oscar winners!,"This album has many of the songs from the wonderful movie Once, including the Oscar winning Falling Slowly. Finally great indie artists are recognized and awarded this great honor, and deservedly so! This is a fantastic album filled with so much emotion. Standout tracks: Falling Slowly, Sleeping, When Your Minds Made Up, Leave.Buy this album, see the movie Once, explore more of Glen's work with The Frames (For The Birds is also an excellent album)."
4,The Swell Season - comments,I enjoy listening to both the lyrics and music. It's mostly easy listening folksy rock with great harmony so if this is your style of music you can't go wrong.
4,The Swell Season,"Having seen the movie-""Once"" I wanted to get this recording. This recording by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova is quite pleasing to the senses. It touches me deep inside. I play this over and over."
3,"Colorful and Fun, but no phonetic spelling.","I just came across this book, and I was so excited to show it to my students. We use the idea of labeling items in scenes and speaking about them in Spanish as one of main weekly activities, so this book would fit perfectly with that task.However, when it came in, I was frustrated to see that there was no phonetic spelling with the Spanish translations on each page. The colors are bright and engaging, the topics of choice and activities are well done, but the lack of phonetics greatly detracts from a product for me, since my students end up learning to pronounce new words incorrectly on their own fairly regularly.My older students do not have this problem, but I do believe this is extremely important for building confidence and cohesive lessons in Spanish.Sra. GoseTeacher and AuthorFlip Flop Spanish: Ages 6-9: Level 1 (Book + Audio CD)"
1,The Killer is Great but CD recording quality is dismal,"Jerry Lee Lewis is my all time favorite musical entertainer, but this recording of a live performance is just about the worst I have heard. One can hardly hear the Killer because of extremely poor recording quality. Looks like they only had two microphones, one out in the audience (audience noise permeates all tracks) and another mike right beside the drums. Between the loud drums and audience noise, the Killer's voice and piano are so far in the background it is unbelievable. Save your money."
3,Not the best on this subject,"Lofting -- the process of transferring the information on paper plan to the real thing, is the one of most confusing and intimidating aspects of boatbuilding. This book sets out to explain it in some detail. Unfortunately the the author gets sidetracked by details and in trying to include all aspects of lofting glosses over some of the fundamentals. It was helpful to me since I had learned the basics from other books, but if you want to learn lofting with no prior knowledge this is not the book for you. There was no discussion of planking and spiling (what I was looking for). The illustrations are helpful, but there could be more. It is not spiral bound as described -- it is a conventially bound paperback which doesn't like to stay open."
2,Latin or Greek,"For the amateur boat builder there are few other books (no other books?) written for the novice to understanding and begin the process of turning sheets of line drawings into full size boat construction patterns. That said, I found the author's excessive use of boat builder's language somewhat egocentric. The nomenclature learning curve makes understanding this book something like learning algebra directly from Archimedes -- was that Latin or Greek?"
4,Very interesting,"I always wanted to know what lofting is all about. Well, now I know. The book is very interesting and explanatory. Although I found some illustrations confusing, I think that it covers the subject in a significant depth. Recomended. I even think of lofting my next boat."
1,Misleading in the extreme,"What good is it if a book is well written if it is misleading in the extreme when it comes to historical accuracy. The distortions Loomis foists on those unfamiliar with the history of the French revolution is a disservice, and his book should be labelled as outrageous fiction. Read Jordan, Thompson, Hampson instead"
1,"Senasational? Yes! History, NO!!","After writing a paper on the French Revolution, I found 4 basic schools of thought: 1. Favorable, 2. Balanced pro and con. 3. Critical but based on reasoned judgement and 4. Hostile and absurd. Loomis is a prime example of the latter, inventing many incidents out of thin air. In one case, he took a priumary source and omitted one word that altered the entire meanng to the opposite of what the writer intended. Loomis was deliberatly falsifying history, an unpardonable sin for a legitimate, which Loomis is not. Instead, he is merely a sensatioal writer of fiction."
3,Another Entry In A Great Series,"This CD featured the songs:1. Rapper's Delight - The Sugarhill Gang2. At the Party - The Treacherous 33. Planet Rock - Afrika Bambaataa4. That's the Joint - Funky 4 Plus 15. Jam on It - Newcleus6. Body Rock - The Treacherous 3The only critique is that songs like Rapper's Delight had no scratching at all, but either way, this is a great CD to add to your collection. Many tracks are out of print."
4,charles the second by jacob abbott,this is a very simply written account of charles the second. easy to understand and interesting. this book does not go into great detail but kind of outlines the main points of his life.
2,Works only with Windows XP,"WEll 5 years ago I did buy this little thing before I bought my PSP .I bought it used and I dont remember why I bought it.Thinking about it that this little device can only sync with Window Media Player 10 if you have Windows XP running in your computer.In the advent of updated Operating system for Windows , the new OS renders this little device obsulete.It actually have a really nice screen and audio. Ipod user where smarter because you can still use the old generation up to the present 2011 with your Mac and PC.What was Samsung thinking when they made this player.I found mine under all my junk during winter spring cleaning and it is going to the donation box."
1,pretty useless,"watching videos on the samsung yh 999 is below adverage because it doesn't play .avi files and videos that would play clear on my computer will lag sometimes on the yh999. if you bought your yh999 to view photos and play music,i recommend you try a 30gb ipod photo for a better experience and cheaper price tag."
1,bad choice,I recently bought a mp3 samsung yh-999 and I have had so many problems just by recording my videos into it. I called tech. support and even they were not able to tell me how to use my divece. I regret my purchase and I recomend the lyra rca or archos.
5,Wonderful!,"This book gave me a perspective of how a mother with asperger's syndrome handles herself and raising 3 girls, one of which has asperger's syndrome also, and keeping her marriage healthy and happy. She is an incredible woman to have accomplished all of this and a successful career also. It give me hope for my son with asperger's."
5,Best book for parents of Aspies,"I have read many books on Asperger's Syndrome, but this is the book that will really help you understand people with Asperger's. The author has a terrific perspective from both being an Aspie herself and having a child with Asperger's. It is written very clearly and addresses the issues of concern to parents. This is the #1 book on this topic that I would recommend to parents."
4,The First in a Very Fun Series,"I remember being very excited when this CD was released - finally, 80's collections! (Of course, now there are so many, it's no big deal) The collection was probably pretty brave for the time - I mean, only two of these songs made number one, and three missed the American Top 40 completely. Now, however, every one of these songs is available somewhere else. Give Priority credit for the inclusion of such (then) oddities as ""Tenderness"" and ""I Got You"", but take away one star for including ""My Sharona"" which was a hit in 1979. The single edit of ""I Ran"" would have been more welcome (to me), but I'll take the album version. A good start to a great series."
4,Charming and eye-catching,An important story told in a charming and simple way that kids can understand and adults would enjoy reading it to them. The illustrations are eye-catching and colorful: guaranteed to attract the attention of even the youngest reader.
3,Difficult to get through,"I am an avid book reader, and I love to read books! This book however, is a few years old and a bit difficult to read through sometimes. It was written by a professor who taught a class on Science, Technology, and Society, so they are very knowledgeable. However, they don't exactly bridge the gap between people who have never read on this subject before, and the material they need to learn. I recommend the book simply because it is a requirement for many classes, though if an updated version of this with less abstract and more poignant language was used, I would be much happier with it."
5,Extremely informative,"McGinn's theories are conveyed simply, so I can understand them, yet he explores his ideas with great depth and breadth. I read this as part of a continuing studies university course, and I would strongly recommend it as part of the curriculum for any course which studies the ways in which science and/or technology impact society today."
2,there are superior books,Design and Compositionby nathan goldstein eloquently discusses each & utilizes masters and modern example paintings.The Surface Planecontains excellent examples of composition for painters as well. marketing/pr ideas maybe areas to explore rather than others so called secrets.How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist: Selling Yourself Without Selling Your Soulis a descent beginning for marketing plans with recommendations for additional informational books.
5,Solid and nice to look at.,"Great hanging rack.looks awesome and compliments stainless steel fridges and ovens.Only negative is you will need to go to the hardware to buy longer ceiling hooks because hooks provided are to short.Hooks need to go through jyprock and into internal roof beam.What the hooks provided don't allow for, is the gap between the jyprock and beam. Up to 25mm gap. so for around $10 you can get new ones. Other than that everything is easy to install and well made."
5,Love it!,We needed a small pot rack and this one is perfect! It's well made and supports our large pots that don't fit well in cabinets. I highly recommend it if it's the size you're looking for.
3,difficult to install,"If you, like me, rent an apartment that only has plywoods for walls, you'd know how difficult it is to install this without wearing down your arms and shoulders from holding this heavy steel for long enough to get it installed, plus it doesn't come with the proper screws that would hold it firm and stable against plywood. With its price, like other products that needs assembling or installing, it should come complete even with those screws that anchor behind the plywood to keep this from drooping? Those."
5,The Best Volume on the Subject,"This is the one best book on the subject! It covers the historical and philosophical backgrounds to the subject, and provides information that you find in newspapers."
1,Defective,It worked for about 2 weeks in my iBook & when I ran updater it crashed the computer. Took to Apple store and they said the memory was defective. Had to return it.
2,If you like maps...,"...this program is pretty decent. If you want to actually get to where you need to go, forget it. I visit dozens of work sites each weeks, and I'd say two out of 10 locations I put into S&T'04 it either cannot find at ALL, or it's put on the map not even close to the actual address (the best one last week was on the correct street, in the correct city, and about 2 miles south of where it actually was).I looked up my home town, and found that, according to MS, have moved a couple miles south, including a 40-room hotel.Another point of annoyance, my client's corporate offices use MS ""MapPoint"" software to track locations. MS S&T'04 doesn't read or even import MapPoint map locations. Same company, same function of software, don't talk to each other. Go figure.I was not a user of any previous versions of S&T, nor will I be a user of any future versions of this software... Going to find something that's Palm-friendly, too."
1,Streets & trips 2004 is a disaster,"Do NOT waste your money on this version. I made the mistake of installing it and uninstalling my previous version. Now I'm screwed. This crashes most of the time and when it doesn""t its not nearly as good as the older version."
1,Inaccurate and unstable,"Within half an hour of buying this product I realized I would be returning it. Two of the first four addresses I tried it got wrong - one was placed about a mile from where it should be (even though the map listed a restaurant at the same address at the correct location) and one was not found because they had the city wrong for the address. When pasting an address copied from one of the sites of interest into the find box, the application froze up and had to be killed. Utter garbage."
3,Plenty of errors but still useable,"We use the plan a route feature mostly and for the most part it does the trick. We need directions in a rural setting and there are a lot of county roads and this program is woefully lacking in information on these rural roads. Plus when it does ferret one out many time it is not even in the same area you told it to look. Plus several time it gave wrong turning directions(turn south when it should have been north). I would expect more from microsoft but thats about the same as expecting your government to change, it ain't happenin'. I will look elsewhere next time I am looking for mapping software for sure."
4,"Great, easy to use mapping software!","I love this program. We use it alot at work and at home for making maps. I used to use mapquest, but you can do so much more with this. I especially like the feature of searching for hotels, restaurants, etc within a certain distance of a point on the map.The only con I can think of is that the addresses arent exactly in the right position, but not everything is built exactly where the address should be!I highly recommend this or any other year of this software. The only reason to upgrade if you already have one of the previous versions of this software is the newer roads (which I need being a road contractor)."
3,Bluetooth GPS Support,Pocket Streets 2004 includes support for Bluetooth GPS units. I have tested the Socket Bluetooth GPS unit with this version. It now allows you to select Com Port 8 for use with the GPS unit.I have experienced a problem with my HP h2215 IPAQ PDA refusing to turn back on after using Pocket Streets 2004 with the Socket Bluetooth GPS. A soft reset was required to restore operation.Bluetooth GPS support was my primary reason for upgrading.
3,GPS support is still lacking.,"A note on the ""improved"" GPS support. The 2003 version only updated your GPS location about every 10 seconds. The 2004 version now updates this every second but there is no option to auto rotation the map. The map does not re-orient itself based on current direction of travel. Also, I don't believe there are any options to show current speed, direction of travel, or a few other GPS options. I'm not even sure if this shows your GPS track. The GPS features are a disappointment. In my opinion, Delorme is superior for GPS use even if the maps are not as nicely drawn."
2,Only half of it works!,"I bought this software mainly for Pocket Streets and Trips. As it tuns out, when I export a map to my PocketPC the pushpins are in the right spot (relative each other) but the map is of an entirely different county!No updates are available and of course Microsoft insists everything is fine."
1,Disapointed,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2004 should be called Microsoft Streets and Trips 1992. There are many streets missing in this program. There are streets in my city that were built 3+ years ago that are not in this program. I do not recommend.
3,Useful and handy but not real accurate,"The 2004 edition seems to be much more oriented towards PDA's and the accuracy still hasn't improved over 2002 & 2001. The reason I purchased it was I thought by now Microsoft would improve the accuracy with GPS competition, etc.Though it is a handy tool for my father that does geneology and is trying to locate a town, which creates another point as it isn't very good with overseas locations, as my father was using the program here and couldn't find what he was looking for in Ireland."
2,Another Microsoft Ripoff,"Evidently all the makers of mapping software use the same,error-filled, database. Delorme used to be excellent, buteach new edition goes down hill. Someone suggested thatMicrosoft's ""Streets & Trips 2004"" was useful. Nope!It has the same errors plus a few new ones.All of them route people from I-65 back onto I-65 instead ofonto the road to my home. Microsoft added insult to injuryby putting the wrong name on my street."
3,"Good program, but don't bother upgrading","Streets and Trips is the best mapping software I've used - and I make a lot of maps. It's easy to use, generally gives good driving directions, and makes great printed maps. I much prefer it to using online maps such as Mapquest or Yahoo.That being said, there isn't much new in the 2004 version. I upgraded from 2001, and there are really no new useful features to speak of (a few small things, but come on, it's been *three* releases since 2001!). The only major improvement I've seen is that the maps have been updated with some road changes around here and I would assume some of the business listings have been updated as well.Bottom line: if you don't have Streets & Trips, this is a good version to buy. If you have S&T 2001 or later, don't bother upgrading."
1,"Same old, same old","Do you ever feel that buying upgrades are a waste of money. Well, this one is a waste of your money. I bought into the hype that you can locate ATM's anywhere in the country and the maps were updated.If your looking for an ATM in Maine, Alabama, Vermont, Wisconsin, and other states, don't bother. Streets and Trips show there are no ATM's in most of the United States. Canada has a few.The Maps are not updated as well. A seven year old neighborhood still isn't showing up in Streets and Trips. Other programs and the internet map sites have had our neighborhood for a few years.If you have an old copy of Street and Trips or MapPoint, continue to use and save your money. I guess this is how a company can continue making a billion dollars a month without creating anything new. Lets hope in a few years Streets and Trips will be brought up to date and include what the marketing guys tell us."
2,GPS Support nearly non-existent,"Good for maps, really poor support for GPS. It only shows your current location as a car icon on the map.No direct support for major GPS brands (i.e. no waypoint management or downloading, track upload or download, etc.)No route downloading to or uploading from GPS!No speed, heading, direction indicator on the car icon, etc.No map rotation (North is always up)No Track recordingNo Screen and/or Voice turn commands! (it won't tell you that you turn is coming up)It amazes me that some of this functionality with is available in freeware apps isn't included in S&T 2004. Gonna try Street Atlas.Good ease of use and functionality for regular map users."
1,Don't spend your money for this program.,"I'm not sure why Microsoft decided to distribute this version. It may be easy to use, but among other things, many addresses are not recognized, what you see on your computer screen is not what comes out on your printer, the location icons are misplaced on the printed version, street names are often not included on the screen - and often when the street names ARE on the screen, they are NOT on the printed version. There are a lot of problems with this program. I used to use Rand/McNally's Street Finder, but they don't currently have a PC version or one compatable with XP. My advise - Keep looking."
5,"Awesome product, blows away those ""cheap"" models","Before I purchased this model, I had a couple of the 30-40 buck 500/1000 watt units from a local bulk item store. They were average for small items, but whenever you tried to get near the max load rating (500 watts), the thing would beep and turns off. This 1000 watt model can be pushed a bit over 1300 watts, and keep on going. To put 1000 watts in perspective, I can power my 21cu.ft. top/bottom refridgerator (.8 amps/110v running, 1.2 max), 7 cu.ft freezer(.8amps running, 1.1 max, sump pump battery charger(1.3 amps), and my 2.8ghz p4 desktop computer with LCD all at the same time(1.1 amps), without getting to the max load rating.The quality of this unit puts the cheap-o's to shame. Now if only I could get another power outage at my house to get a chance to play with it some more... ;)"
4,6 X 10 Tarp,"Quality of the product was very nice, material was heavy duty. Shipping was extremely fast, no problems. Would buy from again."
4,Just a white tarp,"This tarp was fine and fit for purpose. However, the eyelets weren't symmetrically placed and a couple were distorted hence the loss of a star."
4,Amazing in its depth but flawed in its end.,"This book is an amazing account of the history of and life inside of North Korea. The book primarily relies on the testimony of defectors. It is filled with any number of compelling stories about what it is really like to live in North Korea. These stories augment a well written straightforward account of North Korea's history and the life of the Kim's. It makes for fascinating reading and a disturbing portrait of a thoroughly evil regime.My only complaint about the book concerns its last chapter. After spending 500 pages making an airtight case that Kim Il Sung and his successor Kim Jong Il are dangerous psychopaths running an enormous criminal enterprise in North Korea, the author spends the last chapter arguing that the North Korean's would no long pose a threat if the West would just reason with Kim Jong Il. It's as if the other 550 pages of the book do not exist. A disappointing end to an otherwise fascinating and well written book."
4,"Good, Long","A thorough history of N Korea concentrating on Kim Il-Sung and his son. IMO, Martin does try to delve into where KJI is coming from and in his approach to governing and international relations. And he does give credit to Kim Il-Sung when he thinks it is due (regarding the guerilla days). The book could have been edited down further, but I have to admit that the numerous interviews of defectors is necessary. They are the ones who have the first hand knowledge of the closed society. The sometimes repetitiveness of the interviews is necessary to reveal the humanity beneath the statistics and show where there is consensus from the defectors and where there is divergence of opinion.I liked Jasper Becker's 'Rogue Regime' a bit better but they complement each other. Becker's is no holds barred, rightly saying that there is no way that North Korea could have gotten a worse duo of leaders. Martin's is more thorough and nuanced and sometimes too willing to give the Kims the benefit of the doubt."
5,Fascinating reading,"""Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader"" is one of those books I knew that I should read, but was not quite ready to take on 800 plus pages of non-fiction.That is until I started reading it. The knowledge and style of writing of the author has made what I expected to be another dull tome of non-fiction both fascinating and enjoyable.I hope that Mr. Martin is planning a sequel. I will be standing in line.David F. Canmpbell"
5,"Bravo , Mr. Martin!","This is a fascinating story, well told.The book is a blend of history, reporting, and a modest level of editorializing that reads as well as a John le Carre novel.Thanks!"
5,Intriguing,"Great read for anyone interested in gaining an outsider's view from a well-connected source. The author manages to avoid an overly historical tone by writing in a more journalistic style. The book does lean toward historical backstory initially, but he sets the reader up well to enjoy the modern stories and personal tales of his interaction with the DPRK and its people and officials."
5,great family saga,"I absolutely loved this story. It is a wonderful story of the progress our nation made as people settled the west. The characters are well developed, the history revealed is interesting and you are involved in this family's life!"
5,Good Boook,I am rereading Rosanne Bittner's books on my kindle. I read them about 20 yrs. ago and I am now enjoying them again.
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I thought, after reading the reviews, that this would be a book I could really appreciate. But no. Is it the author's writing style? Is it the way modern ideas and terminology are mixed into the historical setting? Most of the books I start, I also finish, but not this one."
3,Too long,It was interesting that it talked about history and the hard times they endured. It was real long in time and a lot of sadness.
3,Good read,Story good but drags in spots. Spelling on kindle needed a bit of tweaking. all in all a good easy read.
3,Wildest dreams,True to life adventures with hardships suffered by a family who fulfilled their dream of settling in the Montana territory.
1,Let's get the engineers!!!,"I can't imagine a worst start than to have a device packaged with it's cutting blade exposed to the unwary and cutting someone as they tried to open it, but that's what happened. After bleeding profusely and exhausting my profane descriptors I managed to put this thing together and try a test cut. You learn right away the one little screw won't hold it aligned and it flexes in the middle of a cut changing a circle into an oval. Tightening further just pulled the screw head thru not allowing it to tighten at all! I finally had to drill holes and put TWO bolts thru it with wing nuts to make it work at all. If you can't fix things don't bother."
5,Very good book,"I am one who likes to read a really good book and one that I can understand. When I came across Black Raspberries and read the introduction, I knew it would be a book for me. I just had to go out and buy it. The best part about a book like this is it has 12 short stories and each story is different. Each Story keeps you wondering how it is going to end and it doesn't always end the way you think it is going to. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and even ones who don't like to read, this book may change your mind. It is worth every penny. Thank You J.L. Campbell for writing such an awsome book."
4,Break neck speed sci-fi action thriller,"I read this book in three nights and looked forward to opening it each time. The plot is well developed and cleverly woven. There are some unexpected twists but the real highlight is the author's character development. They are full, inspired and believable and they wear both black and white hats. I was surprised by the degree of evil and eroticism that the author instilled in the antagonist. I recommend this book to devotees of Clive Cussler and Ian Fleming; many similarities in style and plot structuring. Have a look - enjoy the fast read - and beware of Mr. K! My hats off to Ms. Schartz and I look forward to the release of the sequel."
2,"?Crusader, the Archangel""-? Far from angelic! Profanity and explicit sex","I got part way through and quit! I love Native American lore and culture.My husband is part Native American. I can handle the lore and peculiaritiesbut this goes too far. I thought it was a book about the gallantly strongbeliefs and values but it turns out to be sleazy and profane.The writing is done well and the talent is there but totally sullied bythe manner in which sacred things are detailed needlessly.None of us are perfect and, thankfully, all of us can change but thelack of discretion makes this unbelievable.Sorry, but I was very disappointed and felt very misled by the title."
3,I was disappointed,I have the volume two of Country's Greatest Hits and I love it. This volume was disappointing because I did'nt recognizeany of the performers or the songs. ( I am older )
1,Sends the wrong message,"In this story, Danielle is afraid of the photographer, Ralph, who comes to take the class picture. The photographer is a stranger to Danielle. He is also loud and boisterous. When Danielle refuses to have her picture taken by Ralph, he decides to approach her wearing a puppet. Ralph says, ""You don't have to talk to me, but how about talking to my puppet?"" The message that the author is trying to convey is that a person can be loud, yet still friendly. The message I got was ""don't trust your instincts, and even if you don't want to talk to a stranger, it's okay to talk to the stranger's puppet"". My husband also read the book. Halfway through it, without my saying anything, he said, ""This Ralph is a creep!"" As a teacher of elementary students and a mother of a young child, I am always teaching children to trust their instincts when it comes to a stranger. This book confuses that issue when the ""creepy stranger"" wears a puppet and Danielle decides it's now okay to talk to him."
2,Flexibility with Fragility!!,"This device is delicate so I am not surprised if the HDD failure is common. The plastic pad on the front is already badly scratched after mere 4 hours of use, the silicone is no where to be seen so I have had enough and this guy is going right back!"
2,Napster is terrible,"Overall this isn't a bad MP3 player. The sounds is great and I have no real problem with the controls.However, for full functionality, the system requires you to use Napster. You can add or remove tracks with Media Player, but you can't add playlists this way, which is a big drawback.Napster is just about the WORST program I've ever used. It is slow, unstable, it requires an internet connection, it has popup ads, and it hogs processor time. It doesn't even minimize properly. The box should contain an outright warning that you have to use this terrible program. Until there is an alternative software, stay away."
4,Samsung YH-820 Digital Audio Player,"I purchased the unit second hand and had difficulty at first with it as it had to have the firmware re-run. Window Media Player 10 and 11 would not work and I wanted my music, not Napster music on the player. Samsung were of no help. I found that by trial and error as well as looking at the reviews here that if I look at the player in Windows File Explorer with hidden files/folders showing, I could drag/drop from my files on the computer to the player. No WMP, Napster or any other program. The folder required is SYSTEM\MUSIC."
1,Not a go,"2 of these, 4 months of working with customer support, and finally - Samsung replaces it with a newer model that works fine. I never got either of the two versions I received of this model to work for one full day.This device should not have been released to manufacturing from the design table. Unbelievably bad design, ridiculously slow, destined to fail - the microdrive used in this device will never survive a 16-year-old active teen."
1,Stinky MP3 Player,"Long story short.....I purchased two of these players, one for my wife and one for me. My wifes player was defective so I exchanged it for a new one. Three uses later with her new player and the hard drive crashed. I returned her second one with my player and got a refund. I bucked up a few more dollars for an ipod mini and it was worth every penny. The difference is amazing. With the Samsung the time it takes to transfer music is painfully slow compared to the ipod. Just spend the extra $50 on an ipod and save yourself the trouble. Two defective players out of three....No thanks. Don't buy this player."
2,Not Quite the Same...,"Unfortunately, the change in vocals has completely changed the band. Without McClure it sounds like top 40 country - not something you'd be rockin' to at a bar in Stillwater, Oklahoma. They're probably bankin' now, but I wouldn't buy it if you liked the older Divide stuff."
2,Save Your Money,"When I purchased this book, I thought I would get a book full of different, fascinating CHRISTMAS quilt blocks. The many so called traditional blocks are simply basic quilt blocks done in Christmas colors....gee, I really needed a book to show me how to do that! AND the other blocks are either too simple or to boring to bother with."
2,Extremely primitive designs :(,"As the title states, the designs are way too primitive for me. I know that country designs are in, but this is way beyond that. I think you could adapt some of the blocks and make them less crude but personally, I just kept flipping the pages and shaking my head. I wouldn't waste your money on this one."
3,Its a good cleaning kit for some people Im sure of.,This cleaning kit was okay for my purpises but some stuff I only needed to use a few times. Im sure that some people need this but I dont think its worth the cash.
4,Short but good,"I like this workbook as a supplementary or quickie tool. It is not hearty enough for ""curriculum"". I homeschool so I am exploring different workbooks for teaching tools."
3,"Great Movie, OK DVD","Ok, everyone has seen ""Cherry Falls"" and that is why most people have bought the DVD. Hey ... sure, throw in another movie! But, when that happens, bad things also happen. There are no features! I mean, the movie is excellent, but people who buy DVD's are looking for features too! ""Terror Tract"" was ok, but there should be a few extra things. I read in another review, just go buy the VHS, but another reason why people buy DVD's is for the quality of the film also. So, here are the good points: Great movie, good sound, good picture, etc. The bad points: No features. I have seen MANY other DVD's for less than this that are LOADED with features! Good movie, but not so good DVD."
2,Is it Scarry movie 4 ?,"It's dawson creek meeting scary movie. I was wondering if this movie was a horror or a comedy. The acting is so bad, the killer is laughable in his/her disguisement.The dialogue is ridiculous.My opinion is : it's not derisive enough to be a great comedy and not serious enough to make you scared ! So what is it ? It's like the director wanted to make a comedy but his sense of humour wasn't good enough.Also it's so predictible. I knew who was the killer as soon as all the characters have been introduced (there is not enough possibilities indeed).SKIP THIS ONE !"
1,A tame disappointment...,"Okay, so the DVD box and some of the reviews I read claim that this version of ""Cherry Falls"" contained footage ""they couldn't show you on cable."" Where is it?? Tame by any slasher fan's standards, this film takes a titillating idea (serial killer stalks virgins, so town's teenagers have a big orgy to save themselves) and makes it into a big yawn. The plot developments are laughable, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the villian couldn't scare Miss Muffet. Not enough gore, not enough scares, not enough sex, and not enough production talent by half. I hope that Jay Mohr and Brittany Murphy find better vehicles in the future, and that I learn to stop buying things like this sight unseen. Oh, and ""Terror Tract?"" Now that I have cable, I can watch reruns of ""Tales from the Crypt"" and enjoy myself on the same level - but kudos to Buff Bagwell and the dad from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" nonetheless."
5,Cherry Falls And Terror Tract,This is a amazing dvd both movies are amazing. u will enjoy them both. there are both scary and entertaining in there own way. 5 stars.
4,Maintains a child's interest in learning a foreign language,"The tape is extremely well done; the book is colorful and the index offers good explanations for children with pictures presented with each word, which is good for young non-readers. Following along with the tape is easy since Chris Demarest's illustrations keeps children interested in listening along. There are several chapters with different related topics which offers variety for older readers."
3,scholastic material,"This is definitely more self-study educational material in German than an enjoyable tale for bedtime reading. While that doesn't detract from its value, it wasn't what I was looking for in a book. I imagine this is a very helpful book for children who would like to learn German but who have parents who don't speak it."
5,Great Textbook!,This book was a must for my last semester before I graduate with my Master's in Nursing and my Family Nurse Practitioner degree!!
3,An honest review,"I enjoyed Prenatal Yoga and Natural Childbirth 2 Edby Jeannine Parvati Baker. I knew what to expect because I first learned about JPB and this book before I purchased it. Every midwife is different, just as every birthing mother is different. I enjoy Jeannine Bakers philosophy, outlook, and tone. Her spirit radiates through this book, and her spirit is calming. Jeannine's birth experiences are positive and empowering. Prenatal Yoga was a tool she used to achieve such positive experiences. I took many tools from the book, which I used while birthing my children. We must strengthen our bodies, minds, and souls to achieve an enlightened birth experience. We must find our own truths about God and the universe so we may teach our children. Prenatal Yoga and Natural Childbirth shares the answers JPB has found during her journey on this earth. I recommend this book to mothers seeking to brighten their horizons, and to professionals looking to share what this book offers to others."
1,Skip it.,"I am a prenatal yoga instructor and have have had two babies of my own at home... even I thought this book was too out there! If you want someone's personal account of multiple home births and the astrological signs of everyone she comes into contact with, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, I recommend Yoga Journal/Lamaze's Yoga for Pregnancy video."
2,"Not what I was expecting, and in the end, not what I wanted","What I was expecting was a book about YOGA for pregnant women and how it influenced and could be used during NATURAL CHILDBIRTH. What I got instead was a running advertisement for ""freebirth"" or unassisted birth AND some kind of unidentified and unidentifiable and unending lesson in her personal theology.I did like the same idea in most Unassisted type books: that uninhibited, unimpeded birth in a trusting environment is the best and ideal birth, and the one we all deserve. What I did not like was that the answer, the only answer, is to birth absent of trust and interdependence within the community, and her constant mantra that self-suffienciency was the sign of a true and mature adult.A Note to Jewish readers: this woman claims to be a Jew ending a cycle of violence by not circumscising her son(s), yet in the prayer to conceive him, she and her husband pray to not only more than ONE G-d, but also to Jesus. Not exactly Jewish."
1,Power Supply Problems,"I would agree with the other reviewers that recommend against this drive. The power supplies on these units are notorious for failing - I have had to replace the power supply three times for one of these units. If you have this drive and it suddenly becomes inaccessable and espeically if the drive starts making strange noises, turn of the power as soon as possible and try another power supply, which by the way you should purchase in advance since it's only a matter of time before the power supply dies..."
1,Do NOT buy this drive -- high failure rate,"Do NOT buy this Lacie drive. I have purchased 4 of these LaCie external drives in the past year (one of them was 2TB in size, the other three were 1TB in size), and all 4 of them have failed a few months after I started using them, resulting in a loss of all the data. There is something systemically very wrong with the design of these drives.My recommendation: Buy an Iomega Desktop Hard Drive instead (also available here on Amazon). After the LaCie drives failed, I bought three of the Iomega Desktop Hard Drives (2TB size), and although I've only been using them about a month, they all work great. They are also cheaper than the LaCie drives."
3,"Great Beginning, Bad Ending","Thought the first half of this movie was awesome. There's a plot twistat the end that just ruined everything for me. Dakota Fanning wasamazing however,"
4,"Good, but not excellent...","I think the idea of this movie was really good. I like all of the actors and think they did well in their roles. I just think they added things that didn't need to be added or were underdeveloped so much that they seemed pointless. They just could have done so much more with the story!The ending was a very nice twist; I had no idea that was coming... By ending, I am not referring to the last scene; I'm talking about the reveal. I still find myself questioning the LAST scene... What does it mean? I watched all four alternate endings, hoping for a suitable one. It was one of the alternative endings that I thought to be best, but I won't say which one.There's not much that can be said about a movie like this in a review because I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet. I definitely think anyone into psychological thrillers should see it! I may need to see it again to fully comprehend what went on... It's a real thinker!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"The trailers for this movie lead you to believe that it is a supernatural flick about a girl seeing an imaginary friend who actually turns out to be some real evil entity. Not what it is at all.When you find out who ""Charlie"" the imaginary friend is it adds huge flaws to the story that you cannot overlook. The acting was mediocre, there was no suspense or tension. My cat could have wrote a better story."
3,Depp already did this WhoDunnit,"The first 2/3 of this movie had me going until I found out the punchline was too similar to Secret Window. Seems like DeNiro's people just wanted to throw together a quick-cash horror flick.They stole the catch from another movie then just used standardscary movie scenes to fill in the rest. His comedies and mob movies do better.Why do these characters always have to move out into a large house out in the boonies to ""get away from it all"". Please find some other place and be different for once. I might give it a half star just for that."
1,Don't watch this! A complete waste of time!!!,"I debated on what star I should give this movie: a 1 star or no star. Dakota Fanning and Robert DeNiro are very very good actors, but this movie... it was absolutley horrible! Does any body remember Secret Window, with Johnny Depp? Well, this movie turned out to be like Secret Window, just a stolen idea. Do not watch this movie, for your own safety, do not watch this!"
4,An Enjoyable Phycological Thriller,"Since this movie was rated R I had to fight my parents a little abouy seeing it. But finally my dad and I went to go see it the opening weekened. It was a really enjoyable movie. In my opinion it was not scary, but very well done and Dakota Fanning was exccelent. I liked the whole plot, I mean the movie could have gone to a ghost story to a monster movie, but instead it went in the best direction it could have. There definently was some creepy parts and the ending was intense and made you think at the end. The reason this was a four star movie because I had seen the ending before in another movie and that the red herrings didn't fool me for one second even though they tried. The whole movie I was on the edge of my seat wondering ""how is this going to end"". But don't let the ending stop you from going. Its a good ending just one you have seen before. Go see it and enjoye your self."
4,A solid creepy thriller,"Okay now there were times when this movie could have been a little bit better, but not much better. Dakota Fanning was creepy as hell. Considering how much difficulty directors have been having lately in making scary movies, this one is a step above the rest. It really returns to the basics. There weren't any real special effects or computer generated shots. It was just a scary story set in a house in the woods. Nothing but classic scares in this one. I would definetly recommend seeing it."
3,Wonderful,"This was a wonderful movie. It had a kind of eerie feel to it and kept me in suspense the whole time. So, you may be wondering why I am rating it 3 stars. It's because this is the kind of movie that you can only watch one time to get the feeling of suspense. When I watched it the second time, I was left, well, bored. Just isn't the kind of movie one can watch over and over."
3,A FAIR THRILLER!,"I HAD A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS PRIOR TO SEEING THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. I EXPECTED IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT IT WASN'T!IT WASN'T A BAD MOVIE...JUST NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED OF IT!ROBERT DENIRO AND DAKOTA FANNING GAVE GREAT PERFORMANCES(AS ALWAYS)!THE PLOT HAD A LOT OF POTENTIAL, BUT I DON'T FEEL AS IF IT WAS AS GREAT AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN!SO SEE IT FOR THE PERFORMANCES AND YOU SHOULD BE OKAY!THE SCREENPLAY LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED...BUT IT WAS STILL AN OKAY THRILLER NONE-THE-LESS!THIS IS not A HORROR FILM TO SAY THE LEAST!!"
3,NOT BAD THRILLER WORTH A LOOK!,"OK, This is not DeNiro's finest hour. It is however, a fairly good thriller and it had me guessing for a while. If you like thriller/suspense films,you can do much worse!"
1,Bam-BOOZLED!,"Mulholland Dr., Secret Window? Are you getting the picture? SHENANIGANS!! People walked out when it became clear WHO Charlie was. I wanted to walk out too, but refrained. It turned out I would have missed nothing. People ranking this with stellar reviews obviously never saw the two movies I mentioned, and being their first bait and switch, probably forgave it. That or they love Bobby Deniro, which isn't hard to do. Either way, you've been warned..By the way, poetic license goes off the chart when it becomes clear that the person is crazy. Ridiculous. I wish someone had told Me."
3,What a waste of De Niro and Dakota's talent,"Okay, this one won't bore you to tears but it isn't on the level of The Sixth Sense or any other truly great thriller or horror movie. And whatever you do - DON'T take your kids to this one!The basic plot: Emily Callaway's (Dakota Fanning) mother has committed suicide. Her dad, a psychologist (De Niro) moves to an old house in New York (upstate New York) to start over.That is when things start to get creepy- or should I say they are SUPPOSED to be creepy? Nothing was surprising in this film except the less than stellar performances of De Niro and Dakota Fanning. Both seemed to be stymied by the script and neither got a chance to exercise their acting chops to the fullest. A pity. Wait for this one on cable. It shouldn't last long in theatres.z"
1,"Save Your Time, Your Money, Your Brain Cells, And Spare Your New Media Room Sofa Two Excruciatingly Misspent Hours Worth Of Wear","I can only assume great bulging bags of money were dangled in front of a lot of stars because I can't think a plot this vapid would coax this much talent in on its own strengths. This pretends to be a horror movie, then reveals itself to be a psychological piece, and never once scares, surprises, thrills, or engrosses anyone I personally know who has seen it. It's sadder than it is suspenseful, and in the end such a painful waste of time I was astonished that it ever got made, let alone made with the participation of the big names it lists in a sallow (s-a-l-l-o-w) effort at validation.So thinly plotted was Hide and Seek that it can be sketched out in haiku form, condensing two irretrievable hours of viewing time to five seconds.Ready, kiddies?Mom--tub-based death scene;Dad and girl move to country;Playmate---real?---kills lots!Yep, that's about it, folks...."
3,Light-weight horror,"There is an interesting concept buried in this film however either the director or the powers that be decided to play it safe and in the end served up an unimpressive horror movie. It's pretty bad when your red herrings are OBVIOUS red herrings and motivation is given through a montage of events that happened off camera. It's a shame because it really could have been much better. Plus, the whole tagline of 'come out come out whereever you are' lost it's power with this viewer because it was such a powerful line in Cape Fear that I felt the film-makers were stealing from an earlier DeNiro film. I don't think the acting was bad as some have reported, I believe the downfall were the decisions to play it safe. Overall, it's just an okay movie."
2,Wait! I've seen this before..... a lot!,"If you've not seen Angel Heart, or Secret Window or Fight Club stop reading. You'll enjoy it.I figured the whole story out watching the previews. I went to see this movie hoping I was wrong. I wasn't. This ""surprising twist"" has been done before. Robert Deniro was in Angel Heart. Did he just cash the check without reading this script?I do applaud Dakota Fanning for doing the creepy child role so well."
1,top 10 worst films of 2005,"I didn't think a movie could get any worse than TRAUMA or THE SECRET WINDOW but oh well here you go another really awful movie. I can't think of anything worth writing about this movie, except maybe,just maybe, if you looked at it for decorating ideas then perhaps that's all HIDE AND SEEK has to offer, other than that ITS a bait and switch. Robert DeNiro what were you thinking? He's a fabulous actor,but this must have been embarressing for him, if not well then I am for him and for every other actor in it. HIDE AND SEEK was truely a waste of time, instead I could have been cleaning the toilet . Wait till it hits the TV or let some body else rent it."
5,Excellent thriller,"I happened upon this movie playing on TV this past month. It was so good, I really wanted a copy of the movie so I could watch it again. Very good. Don't miss watching it."
3,Could have been carried out better...,"This movie was decent. Dakota Fanning does a good and rather creepy job as Emily Callaway. I don't know if Robert De Niro was right in his role as David Callaway though. He seems a little old to be Fanning's father. I purchased this dvd blindly and it was worth a watch on a day that I didn't have anything else to do. As a said before, it was decent. The twist was kind of surprising but I think it could have been carried out better."
3,JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED!!,"the best things about this movie is robert de niro, and dakota fanning. de niro, excellent actor, great in all kinds of films, especially mafia films. love him in those. in hide in seek he did what he does, and that was not a disappointment. as for dakota fanning this little girl sure knows how to act better than some adults do. the girls got talent, and she brings it out in all she does. she can be cute, adorable, and smart, but she can also be dark, scary, and weak. beautiful work. the movie overall was good, but it was pretty predictable. but there were some tid bits that you didn't expect, and the ending was pretty good."
1,Negative GAZILLION stars,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. You need a brain transplant if you like this movie or didn't get mad watching it. Everyone who sees this should be hopping up and down in fury like a rabid monkey, pointing at the screen going ""Oh my god! That was horrible! I can't believe this!""Here's the bottom line: If it's 'horror', and Robert DeNiro is in it, it's bad. I've been suckered enough by his presence(""The Godsend"") in a thriller and this is it, I'm done with him in this genre."
3,Robert De Niro + Hide and Seek script + Dakota Fanning = Bad Movie,"The title saids it all. Great actors in a bad movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie was not THAT bad... it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. This isn't a movie that will give you nightmares, but it will live up to some movies like ""Sign"", ""Jeepers Creepers"" etc.I highly recommend to rent this movie rather than going to a theater. Will give you a little scare on some parts. Enjoy."
3,OK Movie--but nothing new,"This movies ok--but it all seems too familiar as it moves along.Personally, I thought it a bit of a rip off of ""The Secret Window""--not in it's entirety--but in certain elements. The actings ok--the filmings ok--the storys a little lame. Not a bad movie--but there are plenty of better ones (plenty of worse ones too) DeNiros a pyschiatrist, his wife has apparently committed suicide, the daughter appears to be having serious adjustment problems--the only real surprise is that at the beginning of the movie--the situation is presented falsely--but as presented the audience has no way of knowing it's a red herring! Unlike the ""Sixth Sense""--which actually provides ample clues to the surprise ending--this movie really only gives false clues!"
2,LOOKS GREAT BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING!,"Proof that almost anything billed as a scary movie can succeed at the box office. Robert De Niro loses his wife and Dakota Fanning loses her cute-as-a-button demeanor in this utterly forgettable fright flick. De Niro plays a widower whose daughter has a sinister ""imaginary friend"" that comes with a body count. The DVD includes a making-of featurette and 14 deleted or extended scenes, four alternate endings among them. Director John Polson and screenwriter Ari Schlossberg offer commentary for the full movie and the deleted sequences.There are very few scares here. Not a terrible movie but a good time waster."
2,"Boogeyman tops hide and seek , Constantine tops both","Not worth the hype at all.This movie was dragging for the longest.I was disappointed that I didn't go and see Boogeyman.People , just wait till it comes out for rent.It's not worth $ 7.25 to sit in a uncomfortable chair for an hour in a half and watch a non-scary movie."
5,"Not jump out of your seat scary, but leaves you shaken.","The movie is not one of those thrillers which cause you to jump out of your seat with gory scenes and monsters out of nowhere. Although it does have its frightening scenes, the fear is not about the shock but a deep psychological one. This is one of my all time favorite psychological thrillers. During the movie you often wonder who the culprit is, attempting to piece things together and it is one of those movies that its twist will leave you thinking - WHAT?! Definitely a great suspence movie and if you are into psych thrillers, highly recommened."
4,"Pretty good film, with a twist...","I won't go into details of what most people have already read abot the plot of this film. I just recently watched this film, which I now own in my collection, and felt it was a good film. De Niro and Fanning give good performances, especially Fanning who gave a very good, and creepy performance... De Niro gives another excellent performance, as usual.This film will keep you guessing, and has, at least for me a hell of a plot twist ending when we finally discover who ""Charlie"" really is... Even I thought there was some supernatural plot line involved, but was blown away by the twist.This is a creepy little film, that has 4 alternate endings as well as the original release... I say this is a must see film... especially for De Niro and Fanning fans... Enjoy!"
1,Not worth the time or effort,"This film is blatanly obvious. There is no real suspense or mystery surrounding the plot. It's quite a shame that Robert De Niro would be involved in something like this. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress for her age and this film does not do her justice. It is a shame, really. This film does not scare, thrill or satisfy. I would stay away if you have not already watched it."
2,Incredibly weak,"Dakota Fanning is the best child actress in Hollywood but even she can't save this movie. Robert DeNiro is a legend but he just seemed all wrong for this part. I never once saw him as a father and his character seemed to treat the daughter as more of an experiment than anything else. A lot of things happen in this movie that defy logic. If your little girl suddenly started looking like she's been to hell and back would you scratch your head and spend hours writing in your journal?The character of Elizabeth Shue was ridiculous. I've seen women move in on widowers before but this characer behaved like a she'd just found the last man on earth.When the twist came things picked up a bit but the climax and the little coda at the end were lame in the extreme. Hide and Seek isn't worth buying. In fact, unless your video store is offering a rent-one-get-one free sale, it's not even worth renting."
2,A Blue State Fairy Tale,"This movie is really a fairy tale in disguise--and like all fairy tales, it communicates an important moral. The moral of this story is that its not advisable for highly educated, urban elites (played by DeNiro) to move out to the country (e.g., Red State land). If you do, then you will almost certainly loose touch with reality, become a psychotic basket case, terrorize your children & neighbors. The end result is that your more stable, Blue-state friends (who had the good sense to stay in the city) will have to put you out of your misery when they come to ""help"" you. As a result of seeing this movie, I plan to move back to a blue-state, post haste, before this happens to me."
2,They did it again. (sigh),I've seen this before. What immediately comes to mind is What Lies Beneath. They are so much alike that they even have quirky couples of the same kind living next door to misdirect you. The only blessing is that Dakota Fanning pretty much keeps her mouth shut throughout the film. I really hope that Amy Irving will be given a more prominent role in the future.
4,solid base - poor ending,Fanning and De Niro deliever very well preformances in this movie - but they all go down the drain because of the ending - but you will definatly get your money's worth out of this film
1,Waste of My Time and Netflix Postage !!!!,"I received this movie the other day as a Netflix film. I am glad I didn't have to pay for the return postage or it would be in the trash. This is one of the worst, if not the worst thriller I have ever seen. How in the world can a movie starring both De Niro and Dakota Fanning be so horrible? I am still amazed. This movie is worthless!! This will be a scar on the careers of both De Niro and Fanning. First of all if it would have been for netflix I would have never finished the movie. I tried to watch numerous time and each time I fell asleep. I NEVER fall asleep during a movie!! This movie does not develop as a good thriller should. It doesn't bait you, it has no twist. Finally in the end your left thinking ""that is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen"". I everybody will forget about this movie and Fanning and De Niro will go on with there successful careers."
4,Don't let all the negative reviews stop you from seeing this movie!,"I can't believe all the negativity put forth here. Sure, the shocking twist towards the end left a few plot-holes to be considered for the rest of the film; but still, there were some solid performances carried out from DeNiro and Fanning. Every scene was pulse-pounding and downright creepy. What ended up making the whole film even more shocking is that the events were actually based on reality.It's a shame that Elizabeth Shue didn't have a bigger role but that figures in with the climax of the movie as well.All in all, this is a frightening and well done thriller which could have used a little more work with it's twisting conclusion. However, the performances more than compensate. It is definitely worth owning."
2,DeNiro and Fanning are better than this!,"Thank god I waited for this on cable. Horror movies these days just aren't scarey. They think if they throw in a little kid saying some creepy things that don't make sense until the end, and have some writing on the walls in blood, it makes for a good thriller. That is just not the case. This movie did exactly that and was not at all scarey. Not to mention it totally stole its ending from The Sixth Sense, which actually was a good thriller. Dakota Fanning and Robert DeNiro are such talented actors, what are the doing starring in this crap!? Don't see this if your expecting a scarey movie, it's really weak."
3,Robert De Niro & Dakota Fanning pull the wagon in this one !,"While not the most original scary movie ever made ""Hide and Seek"" is a very well acted & creepy little twister with 1 or 2 real heart stopping jumps. Another kill or two & i would,ve given it 4 stars!"
2,Not scary!,"Okay this movie was supposed to be scary riight? Yes it was. But I figured the ending out halfway through the movie. This could have been a really scary concept. But it's not, and it's boring, a waste of my time and yours."
2,Worst De Niro film in years,"This film was very irritating in that it attempted to create suspense without a real plot. The acting was good, but the storyline was just poorly developed and it almost seemed that the people making the film really didn't know where to go with it. Is that why there were 4 or 5 alternate endings? And none of the alternate endings were any better than the original one.If this film cost $3 million to make, I'd bet De Niro probably got $2.5 million, the other actors split most of the rest, leaving nothing for the script writer."
2,"""You stole my story!""","The performance by Dakota Fanning is what gives this completely unoriginal flick two stars. It was actually kind of embarrasing to watch Robert Deniro waste his talent on a movie like this. There were a few jumpy moments, but I left the theater feeling thankful that we had free movie passes. Rent this one!"
3,Robert de niro's second dud in a row,"After the awful GODSEND, I was hoping that De Niro would return to the great films he once did. Hide and Seek is directed by John Polston who did the average SWIMFAN four years ago. John obviously enjoys filming thrillers (and that is fine) but both SWIMFAN and GODSEND suffer from something trying to be more than it is. HIDE AND SEEK falls flat halfway through after a promising buildup."
3,Ghost of greatness,"Fanning is brilliant in her role as a haunted young girl. DeNiro, as mentioned elsewhere, is all wrong for the part of her father. Not because he can't act, but because these days he can't keep from impersonating himself - a condition afflicting most established stars. It's kept in check throughout most of the picture, but once the disappointing ending is set into motion his hammy performance summons to mind Analyze That, Meet the Parents, etc., completely killing the tension built early on. Just an average thriller overall."
2,Not good at all!,"Just because you put two great actors together doesn't make a movie good, I'm sorry but it doesn't. The basic plot wasn't bad but they should've went a different direction with it. I thought to myself halfway through the movie who Charlie was and said no way it can be him, if it is then this movie's ending will suck. I didn't even take the time to watch the 4 alternate endings because the one on the movie sucked enough. The only reason it gets two stars from me is because of the great actor Robert DeNiro and the up and coming great actress Dakota Fanning. Other than that don't waste your time or hard earned money renting or especially buying this poor excuse for a film."
2,Entertaining but not as good as others in its class,"This movie moved along well and held my interest. Dakota was really good, but Denero didn't seem to fit the role. Movies like this usually throw up false leads and then tie them together with the ending. Too many of the leads in this movie turned out to be nothing but false. There were too many loose ends. The basic idea for the ending was good but it's already been done and done better. If your a big fan of movies like the Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes, this one would be good to watch just for comparitive purposes."
5,"Cheap Price, On Time, Great Product","My title explains it all.... I have no complaints. Truly, everything was above the satisfactory level!!!!!!!"
2,Another waste of talent...,"Both actors are great, just not in this movie. I do believe they were hoping for a movie along the lines of Sixth Sense or The Others, it didn't happen. I kept hoping it would get better but it failed there, and the suprise ending, really wasn't much of a surprise. If you don't figure out what is happening before they reveal it, then you might be one of the people that really likes this movie."
2,Good movie to rent,"If you watched this movie at the theater and want to see the alternate endings, please don't bother. The 4 alternate endings are done very poorly and not worth renting/buying just for this.As for the people that have never watched this movie, it's a good renter. If you have watched and liked ""Secret Window"", you will like this. At the same time, if you didn't like it, this will be a disappointment. Acting is great and movie does give you a good thrill."
2,Great Comedy. O wait.....,This movie was just too predictable. I figured everything out within the first 20 minutes. It was good for a laugh though.
1,not worth seeking,"I have a list of plot twist cliches that Hollywood, or any filmmaker should avoid like the plague if they want to make a movie worth watching.1)It turns out the hero is stuck in a limbo between life & death2)The hero has multiple personalities (at least one of which is also the main villain)3)The whole story is a dream.4)The hero is really a ghost and doesn't know it.Just in case anyone reading this is actually interested in watching Robert DeNiro destroy his career by acting in his 2nd bad ""thriller"" in as many years (""Godsend"" was anything but), I won't tell you which cliche is used here. Odds are you'll figure it out yourself in 30 minutes or so of watching this movie.This movie is also emblematic of why people have been staying away from the theaters in droves & are now evading the video stores. There is nothing fresh to offer.And lets face it, on a hot summer day there is nothing less enjoyable than sitting and watching mold grow."
4,Creepy!!!,"This was good...another must see. A good rental. Oh my gosh, I didn't know if it was the daughter who had problems or if there was a Charlie...Great!!! See it for yourself!!! If you liked Perfect Window you will like this one!!! It is creepy!!!"
3,You should Hide from this movie,"When i bought it looked like a good movie. And at the begging and middle of the movie it was, but they toatlly screwed it up at the end. When the dad was the killer. He had a split personallity c'mon doesnt every horror movie end like that. We want something new. God. I liked Doakata Fanny's Acting anyway, it the patensal of being a good movie then they screwed it up. I should not even bother. I give it 3 out of 5."
2,Seen it all before,Robert De Niro plays a psychologist who's wife commits suicide. He and his daughter played by Dakota Fanning move to upstate New York. It doesn't take long for weird things to start happening. For a psychologist I found it odd that De Niro's character seemed to have little insight into his daughter's psychological issues and seemed at a loss with how to deal with her apparent imaginary friend. Little things like that make films less believeable. Quite frankly Dakota Fanning's talent is the only reason to watch this film. You're likely to be disappointed and very unsurprised at the so-called twist at the end of the film.
2,Hide and Seek is neither fun nor scary...just plain dumb,"Robert De Niro (Meet The Fockers, Meet The Parents) brings his daughter, Dakota Fanning (the upcoming War Of The Worlds, Man On Fire) to a uptsate country house after Fanning's mother takes her own life. Soon after they move in Fanning starts to tell her dad of her imaginary friend named Charlie. De Niro starts to become more and more worried about his daughter and strange things happen. The end is another one of those twist endings we all love....sometimes. I think De Niro and Fanning did a good job though this movie is neither scary nor suspenseful...it has its moments. Also starring Elisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas, The Saint), Dylan Baker (Changing Lanes, Along Came A Spider), Robert John Burke (Fled), Amy Irving (13 Conversations About One Thing, Tv's Alias) and Famke Janssen (X-Men 1 and 2, GoldenEye)."
3,Decent but nothing to write home about.,"When seeing the previews for this movie I thought it was gonna be a great thriller/scary movie along the lines of sixth sense. Although it has an interesting twist that you can almost see coming just because it is so similar to other movies of this genre. The movie lends itself some fun jumps and scares but overall is predictable. Certain things do not match up during the movie and the only reason I would really rewatch the movie is to see how many little details I could pick out. Although the story has structural problems the acting was exceptional. Robert Deniro,the incredible actor that he is, plays yet again another incredible ""psycho"" role. Elizabeth Shue and Dakota have excellent roles which the portray in a very sound believable fashion. Having said that, I would probably wait until this one comes out in the rental stores rather than pay 8 bucks to see it in the theater."
3,"'Seek' for the Movie, 'Hide' from the Alternate Endings","A very interesting movie to figure. Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning gave great performances. Fanning's character is very scary to learn. A very tense movie with the sounds and the music.The Special Features are a different story. The Alternate Endings were just stupid. It was like the same thing over and over again except 4 times over. If the endings were different I would be interested. Deleted Scenes, I can understand now why there not in the movie. The rest of the features were okay.Letter Grade: C+ (over all)Letter Grade: B- (Movie)Letter Grade: D+ (Features)"
3,Mediocre thriller!,"After the suicide of her mother, Emily, played by Dakota Fanning, and her father, played by Robert De Niro, moved away from the city to a quiet town, only to find themselves not alone.Well at first, the cast is good featuring Elisabeth Shue and Famke Janssen. Dakota Fanning is great in this movie. Second the story is also good, but the story lacked depth to it. I though there could be more to the story, and I feel lik the middle of the movie is just THERE to make up for time.Overall, it is an OK thriller with twist to it, and on the DVD it comes with 4 alternate endings."
3,Gets the Heart Pumping,"This was a bit more of a thriller than my wife and I had anticipated. The characters were a bit hard to relate to but it was good acting. Robert DeNiro plays a very intense character, whose personality takes a little twist. Not everything is completely believable in the film, but it kept me on the ""edge of my seat.""Dakota Fanning is amazing. I don't know how a little girl can act so many horrifying scenes like those. She must be able to separate herself from what she is acting. This film is definitely not appropriate for children."
4,AFTER ALL WAS GOOD THRILLER .!,"I liked this movie, Yes wasn't all that and great movie, But was suspense and thriller..And of course loves De Niro,, He's acting is great in any movies he played,This movie remind of movie ""FRAILTY ""such as I loved that movie, and superior to this of course, But after all I enjoy"" hide and seek"", Maybe not to buy,But worth a rental for sure. AP.S .""Theater ending"" was the best one, To end the movie!"
1,butterfly window cling are cheap cheap cheap.,I found these window decoration very disappointing. I put them on my kitchen window and two days later decided to peel them off. Not attractive at all.
3,got it slow,I got the product as advertised. I went with Amazon over another web provider thinking that it would be more reliable but the shipping and the price was higher and then the delivery was slower. Not Amazons fault on the cost and shipping I should have just not ordered it at Amazon but I let the convenience overcome my better judgment and paid not only in cost but in slow delivery.
1,"Boring, amateurish waste of $$ and time","Based on the price and the self-promoting hype describing this disc, I expected a worthwhile listen. Anybody can burn a CD, but this guy should have been stopped long before things went this far.They rhymes are forced, the tunes are dated, production is amateurish and ""spoken word"" apparently is today's catch phrase for ""I can't sing.""Forget this. It's worse than throwing money away, because the evidence of your bad taste remains behind to taunt you. The best part of this CD was putting it in the microwave and flaming it. At least the colors were real."
2,Only a little better that the rest of the series,"If you're hooked on the LEFT BEHIND series, then I guess you have to read this one too. But if you'd like to read a much more intelligent book on the subject, I recommend THE EZEKIEL OPTION by Joel C. Rosenberg or the books of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur."
2,What is the point of this book?,"The Rising was an okay novel- as far as prequels go-, but all it really does is show you how Nicolae Carpathia came about and tells you a little bit about Rayford Steele when he was younger. There wasn't much excitement and the book could have been written in half the length it was. As far as I can see, this book will only be enjoyed by the hardcore Left Behind readers."
2,the rising,"I believe Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye are milking the interest generated by the the Left Behind series. They should allow this topic to go quietly into the night. Instead of promoting the message of the gospel which is salvation of one's soul, they are promoting the greed, materialism, and pride of the world. We as Christians have enough to overcome with our faith without having obstacles placed before us by our own brothers in Christ. Swallow you pride fellas and find a different topic to write about!"
2,Disappointed,"I read this book as quickly as I had the other 12 left behind books. But this time I was reading quickly not because I was engaged in the action and excited by the characters but because I was wondering where the story was going to get good. I found the background provided on the characters to be pretty inconsequential. It didn't really shed any light on who they were when ""left behind"" began. Rayfords past felt irrelevant and Nicolae's past- while disturbing- was not surprising. A main character from the 12 original books is not even mentioned in this prequel and I was really looking for him. Glad I got it from the library and did not buy. If I wanted to share my excitement over this series with someone I would certainly have them start with ""Left Behind""- book 1- not this prequel for fear they would not be interested in continuing with the series."
5,Well written...kept you interested!!!,"Anyone who has read the other books in the series must get this book. I read this book all the way through the first night I bought it, and could not put it down. Whoever said that this book is dull was wrong. It was great. It really helps put more of a perspective on who the characters really are. i give it 5 stars!!!"
3,It's only fiction.,"I read the Left Behind series and enjoyed it, although it did get just a little long. I have read the first two books of the prequel and will probably read the next one. This searies is listed under 'Fiction'. That to me means it isn't true and the writer can do what he/she wants with it. LaHaye and company do tend to push their personal beliefs in their books but they are 'their books' so they have the right but I don't have to agree. The books are entertaining although they are not as good as the Left Behind series."
1,Read the Christ Conspiracy or The Suns of God,This story is getting a little tired and drawn out. A book you might find more exciting is The Christ Conspiracy by Acharya. The Suns of God is also very enlightening.
1,Demeaning toward women - and other lifestyles -,"I almost threw up! I read the Left Behind Series...realizing it was fiction .. based loosely on Biblical reference! It was okay! .but this book....is prejudical, debaising towards women,and very amazing with it's ""rightous attiudes"" ... so sad!Fiction like this is ""horror fiction"""
1,I can't believe that the authors. . .,". . .actually had the gall to write this book. I am literally speechless.As if the 12-volume, anti-historical, anti-Biblical, anti-Catholic, poorly-written series of silliness wasn't enough. . .along comes ANOTHER ONE???Why, when the characters were never flushed out in any reasonable way OVER TWELVE VOLUMES, should we care about their ""lives"" BEFORE the series even started???This latest ""effort"" is truly embarassing."
1,The barrel has officially been scraped.,Bad bad bad. Bad theology(These books are VERY anti- Catholic)and bad writing. And yet they have such a HUGE following.Why? And why is there a need for prequel books to let us in on what happened BEFORE the Rapture. I REALLY hope that LaHaye and Jenkins aren't planning on stretching these books out as long as they did with the original Left Behind series.
2,Why did they have to make prequels?,"I absolutely loved the Left Behind series...some installments more than others, of course, but it will always remain one of my favorite series. At first I was excited to hear that they were going to write prequels...a chance to get to see how the characters in Left Behind became who they were, and all that...but after getting a few chapters into the book, I was struck by how boring it all was. Also, it felt like the authors went a little too into detail about some of the Satanic stuff...but maybe that was just me.Despite my disappointment with The Rising, I will probably continue to read the prequels; one can only hope that it gets better from here."
3,Entertaining Fiction with Some Dangerous Beliefs,"This book is the first of a series of prequels to the huge Left Behind Series. Because I have read all of the others, I wanted to read the remaining volumes as well. I enjoyed this book for the most part, as I believe any fan of the original series will. It simply delves in more detail into the early lives of two of the Left Behind series main characters, one of whom is the anti-Christ. I have mixed feelings about these novels. One the one hand I find them entertaining (I wouldn't have read over a dozen volumes, if I didn't.), on the other hand, I don't agree with all of the dogma or specific religious beliefs of the very opinionated authors. So while there are some important ideas, and even some truths put forth in these stories, the fact remains that they are fiction and should be read as such.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, ""To Be Chosen"""
5,Great Story,Perfect addition to the Left Behind Series. I enjoy all the books by Tim LaHaye. I plan to give the set to my sons one day.
2,please start includeing book size,"first, would have liked to know book size . did'nt know this set came in different sizes. for this order the shipping was twice the cost of the books three books in an envolope the spine of one book was broken. will not be ordering any more,not happy so bite the bulllet why waste more money to send them back. i will now go to a second hand book store to find what i want."
4,"Very good, but could have been better.","I enjoyed this book immensely and couldn't put it down, but I found the parts about Rayford as a child, and later Rayford and Irene, boring. Marilena (Nicolae's mother) and how Nicolae came to be and all the intrigue that follows made the book a real page turner. But when that ends and the authors spend more time fleshing out Rayford and Irene, I became less interested. Give me the intrigue of Marilena, Nicolae, and Viv Ivins! That's what I want.I really looked forward to finding out more about the characters when they were younger, and this book does that.All ""point of view"" characters in the series are ""good"" on some level, and I think it is a reflection on Marilena that she was a POV character until that section was over.I give it 4 stars. I loved reading about Marilena and the people around her; Rayford and Irene bored me."
4,"Overall a good read, but...","I was dissapointed by the inconsequential death of Marilena Carpathia, mother of the Antichrist. The narrative followed her own personal and spiritual journey, through thick and thin, for about 200 pages (or so). I was involved in her life like you would not believe. For a while, THE RISING was one of the better books I had decided to pick up. And she was the reason. Then she died. And it was over. Her end was not very exciting and did not live up to the expectations I had. I mean, I know she had to die sometime. But something was missing. What, I don't know... To be honest, I didn't really care about Rayford's life before the rapture. And that was pretty much the only thing the book had to offer after that. Anyway, its a pretty good book. For a while. Get it from the library if you haven't read it yet. Don't buy it first."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz *Snore* <cough>,"If you have read any of the other books in this series, you will find that this one is exactly the same as all of the rest. The first two were fairly intriguing but the rest I was only able to browse thru after relatives finished. I tried to give this one a chance but I would say ""The Omen"" was a better plotted book on the same theme and is probably as near to the truth on what will actually happen at the end of days as the LB series."
2,Great music but a poor production,"I was disappointed with this DVD!As soon as I saw the overture with a young, stiff, seemingly terrified Claudio Addado at the conductors podium I got uneasy vibes. Then, the fact that the production was a movie did little to reassure me. Add to this, that the audio was lip-synced to the video (and rather poorly at that) further downgraded my enthusiasm for this production.The characters had costumes that were overdone and seemed, to me, to add very little to the intended comic effect. The comedy, in fact, seemed to be almost slapstick at times: contrived, not to mention chaotic.So, were there no redeeming features to this production? Yes, the music of Rossini: wonderful tunes, good voices and the orchestrated aspect of the opera was well done despite the above mentioned distractions.But surely there must be a better Barber of Seville on DVD out there somewhere."
2,I think this is the worst barber I've ever heard,Herman Prey lacks of enthusiam an carisma for the role of Figaro. Alva is mediocre. Bergaza is the only perfomer that is worth while hearing. Abbado was disapointing.
2,Poor quality of language and editing,"I found the dictionary to be very well organized and clear to read for high school students. But, there are numerous typographical and spelling errors as well as misuse of vocabulary. I urge the publishers to demand for higher quality in their publications."
4,Collector's Item,"This is a great item for a Transformer's fan, but defiantly not for someone who intends to use this to actually play chess. Each piece has the symbol of the chess piece it represents, but it does become a bit of a hassle to constantly check which piece is what short of memorizing which transformer represents each piece.The pieces are a sort of soft plastic material, and the whole set has a smell of spray paint. Again, great collectors item, but not recommended for those who wish to play chess with this chess set."
5,Great for Transformer and Chess Fans,We used this as an incentive for my 9-yr-old to get straight A's on his report card. He did it and couldn't wait for it to come in. I ordered it ahead of time and was able to give it to him the evening he got his report card. He (and my husband) love it.
4,Great for time sharing.,This game has kept the Grand Sons interested and has helped them learn the game. The boys and myself have spent several hours togetherplaying and keeping them away from staring at the TV all day. Great learning tool.
3,"Cool to play with, not good for begineers","Overall I love this chess set. I love transformers, the price was right when I bought a few years ago, and it's held up to years of actual use.I didn't buy this as a collector item, and have used it on and off over the years. The pieces have held up great, no problems with durability or quality.The board itself is nothing special, just a regular checkerboard looking thing with transformer logos on it.The one compliant I have with this set is that over a long game it really becomes a pain to keep track of the pieces and which one does what.I have won and lost a game because I had lost track of what a certain piece was. In addition, it also makes it hard to teach new people how to play chess because they have to worry about learning the game as well as keeping track which piece is what, with no real good visual cues.Overall no regrets as long as the price is right."
1,"Strong paint odor, impossible to repack, hard to recognise","I received this for my son for the holidays. My first impression was a very strong overwhelming paint odor. The other problem was trying to identify the pieces. Fortunately the pieces have a small symbol at the base to show what it is. But it does make it difficult to play, as it is very easy to misidentify a piece.My last beef was it's a bit difficult to repack as they are vacuum packed in plastic and finding the correct location for each piece is impossible.If you want a chess set go out and buy a chess set. This is only useful if you are a collector of some sorts."
4,Extras?,"I haven't really bought very many music video compilations on DVD so I didn't really know what to expect. The only other one I have is the Beastie Boys collection. So it seemed that this anthology seemed a bit bare bones to me. A little CD artwork and background information, but no commentary or the like.Otherwise this is an excellent introduction to a recent Blur fan such as myself who has pretty much only seen the video for Song 2. Some videos made me go ""wha?"". Especially There's No Other Way. But you can see the improvement over time. Also how each video makes good use of Albarn's creepy stare. Coffee and TV is now my favorite music video of all."
3,Blur's DVD a bit Blurry,"This being the first Blur video release of any kind, I was excited. Their music is awesome, but not all of their videos are. Some of them, like ""Coffee and TV"", ""The Universal"" and ""Song 2"" are some of the best videos ever created; then there are videos like ""There's No Other Way"", ""She's So High"" and ""Girls and Boys"" which are some of the absolute worst music videos I have ever scene. The only special features there are is chapter selection, and a bit of technical information on each song. While exploring this DVD, it seems like not much effort at all was put into it. However, the music is great to listen to, and the majority of the videos are good. It's just some other things that detract this DVD from being amazing. But if you like Blur, by all means, buy this to add to your collection. I myself, really like it."
4,TDK DVD RAM discs,"Discs are performing adequately, but not as well as they could. I suspect the age of my recording equipment is partially to blame. Other than that I'm satisfied with the product."
2,This looks a whole lot better in the picture than it does in the real world,"No part of the gold shines. I don't expect rose gold to shine but neither the yellow gold nor the white gold shine either. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't do it."
2,Good for thin haired dogs,This clipper is too small yet it is too noisy! It can't even cut through thick hairs like that of my Shihtzu plus it frightens my dog w/ the loud noise it produces. However I was able to use it to groom my chihuahua because of the thin hair she has.
2,On/Off Button in terrible location,"this little trimmer could be a five star, but poor design places the on off switch in the worst possible place, and anyone that has used these can testify that it gets very frustrating having to turn your trimmer back on because you accidentally keep hitting the on / off button...too bad..."
5,5 Star Clipper,"I had this clipper years ago. Couldn't find it locally. Was glad to find it on Amazon.I have 4 little senior dogs, and it works great on their paws,and to keep their faces neat.A larger clipper just doesn't work as well on the small faces.The clipper arrived in a couple of days.Great service."
1,Does not work on my Shih Tzu,"I got this to trim around my Shih Tzu's eyes in between groomings and it just shuts down, my dog's hair must be too thick for this. In reading the other ratings, I thought it would be OK, but this was a total waste of money, very disappointed."
1,Won't cut,"I have a very small dog and this was to trim around eyes, ears, paws and his little behind but it won't cut at all. He goes to the groomer and his hair is never thick or long and this gadget can't even handle the in between trims. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Ok as a Resource,"I think this book is a good place to begin, but is basically a listing of lodings that accept pets. I would prefer to see fewer listings, but places where dogs are WELCOMED, not just allowed. I just began traveling with my dog and I plan my destination on pet friendliness, rather than choose a destination and look for ok hotels. Plus, I need to know the dog-friendly activities and tourist attractions. I'm glad I bought this book because it helps begin my research, but I still am looking for more."
1,Not as Promised,"Bought the book based on the information that a web page was available for up to date information, links, planning information etc., etc., etc. No of this is available. All the website has is a slight discription of the book. NO OTHER INFORMATION."
2,Disappointed!,This is the first book by Lescroart I was really disappointed with. Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky seem depressed and burned out. It seemed neither one wanted to do anything about anything. There is no actual mystery - the prologue gives the ending away and the story just seems to plod along. Only near the end of the book does it begin to pick up and show some life. Don't think I'll read anymore in this series - these characters are too depressing!
4,One of LesCroat's best,"This is one of LesCroat's best books with the character development and plot that makes him such a great writer. I've been disappointed in his last two books, so I was happy to go back to his signature style."
1,"Lame and slow, with trite characterization.","This was the first novel I've read in a long time that failed to engage me at all. I plodded through it, hoping it would improve. It was a serious waste of time. I was astonished to discover that this book was not the author's first novel. I knew what was going to happen from the first chapter, but it didn't matter. The story was lame and the writing very sloppy."
1,Disappointing,"The premise of this story is a good one: a disappointed cop,and his protective lawyer-buddy, have to take the law into theirown hands to stop some heavily-entrenched, protected, thugs and criminals from further injuring the innocent. But the excitingpromise is never reached. The author spends so much time tryingto be ""politically correct,"" his personal goals get in the wayof a good story, and the book is disappointing.Only for a few, so be careful about how much time you put intothis one."
1,WARNING! DO NOT READ the first 4 pages of part one,"In The First Law Lescroart did NOT separate the prologue from Part One. Therefore he gives the ending away. And between that and the first few pages of the real beginning of thebook everything is given away. The criminals, their targets, their motivations and their MOs. No mystery left.I never read prologues for that very reason. I do NOT want to know the ending or anything for that matter before it actually happens. I'm disinclined to read further. What a waste of mymoney. I'm Disgusted!So DO NOT READ the first 4 pages of Part One. As reviewer Tucker Andersen states as a consequence of this unannounced prologue, ""Thus, there is never any real mystery of whothe murderers and criminals are..."" So what's the motivation of reading further? Lescroart's writing is not that hot to where I'll read it regardless."
2,Not His Best,"I have enjoyed the Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky series of books very much. This one however, although containing all the characters left a lot to be desired. As others have said, the prologue pretty much tells you where this book is going and then it seems to take forever to get there. Having made the trek you are left wondering if it was worth the effort. The first law may be survival, but the way it is portrayed in this novel leaves a bad taste in the mouth."
5,Perfect depiction of Job,"I have rarely read a book that brought to life an age old story (in this case the Book of Job) as Heaven's Wager did. Astonishingly, some, such as the previous reviewer, either miss the point entirely or have not read Job. Yes, Heaven's Wager is gritty in some respects, but then so was Job. In fact, according to the Bible, Job's entire family was killed by Satan in his wager with God. And yes, God expressly permitted it.So why the shock when a contemporary story does the same? Perhaps modern day folk simply don't like the God of the Bible.I found the story wonderfully redemptive. It mocks the power of death and offers hope beyond. Nothing New Age about the book in any respect. A must read for any who want to dig past the plastic most coat thier religion with."
2,A good read....but good theology?,"So, a modern Job story? A story that displays God's sovereignty? I agree it was a good book. I thought about it when I wasn't reading it. I couldn't put it down when I was. But do you all freely agree with his theology? Just because it's in a fiction book do you think that God really works that way? Job was a God-fearing man. His ungodly children died...b/c of Satan. I don't remember a time in the Bible that God killed off a bunch of Christians so that an ungodly man would turn to him. Just because an author can craft a great book doesn't mean he's always right."
3,Heaven's Wager--original story??,I am wondering if anyone else has noticed the similarity in story line between Heaven's Wager and The Partner by John Grishom. I am just amazed at how alike they are. Though I don't know the legal fine points it seems very close to plagarism to me. I doubt that I am the first to notice this so I am surprised that no one has already mentioned it here.
5,1 word. Incredible,"This book is a very provocative read and has a good story line that even someone who isnt a Christian will be able to read this and maybe start wanting to learn more about God just from this book. I found the whole software and code writing part of it very interesting. Plus, the fact that he was running away from his past and trying to run away from God in the same process. Very good book, should be picked up as soon as possible."
3,good not great,found the story of kents revenge fascinating. story about helen and heavens challenge seems more like the stories that end with ...and then he woke up
5,Stay with the book and you will get a WOW,"Ok, I picked this book up 6 months ago. I read the first few chapters and then put it down. Well, a few days ago I ran out of books to read so I picked this one back up. Once I got over the hump of 100 pages I couldn't put it down. This book is two stories that constantley over lap. First Helen the mother in law, then Kent the son in law. Helen can actually see and hear heaven. I see and hear God everyday but Helen actually saw Heaven open like a seam in the sky. A little much for me to swallow. Kent is in a battle for his soul. I don't want to give to much away but I have never read a Christian book where someone goes off the deep end as much as Kent does. It is a page turner. You really wont know if Kent choses God or Satan until the last few chapters. I literally closed the last page and said WOW. I would take some time to read this book, it has some crazy twists."
5,Spiritually thought provoking,"I won't discuss plot here, since you can read that in other reviews and on the buyer's page...but this book is excellent. It does move a bit slow at the beginning, but once it kicks into gear, its full throttle all the way! This book is NOT for the spiritually immature, nor is it something that agnostics or atheists will enjoy. It is for the Christian who is looking to read something real and strong and emotional - but solely focused on the work of God, and His control over EVERYTHING that happens. You'll be thinking about the implications of your actions, words, AND this book for a long time! Highly recommended."
4,Awesome Read,Ted Dekker has been one of my favorite authors for some time now and I thought that it was time to go back and visit some of his older works to further appreciate his newer ones. Heaven's Wager did not disappoint. I began to really feel for the novel's main character Kent Anthony and in the battle for his soul apart of me wanted God to win while another part of me wanted him to see his crimes through and embrace the darker side of himself. This inner battle allowed me to look deeper within myself which is what I believe the author was trying to get us to do. One of the main themes in the book was that we are all involved in a spiritual wager where God and Satan are both vying for our souls. Many of Ted Dekker's works are a little dark and you have to kind of prod around to see the Christian value in his books but not with Heaven's Wager. The spiritual battle took a front seat and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to read the next installment of the Martyr series.
5,Jam packed with great information,"Hats off to Toby Velte for this awesome refernce book. I currently hold CWNA and CWSP wireless certifications as well as CCNA and CCDA, and I find ths book packed with some great reference material.Usually when you see a ""Quick Reference"" book means that it has limited information and explanations. Not so with this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who works on wireless networks or are planning on implementing wireless."
5,"emotionally charged, romantic Beethoven","The Kodaly Quartet's playing of this music is insightful, incisive, emotional, and *gasp* duly romantic. This recording is at the top of my list for these pieces. Naxos continues to amaze me with talent of their musicians and the sound of their recordings. Get this disc."
5,BEST OF THE SERIES,"Just purchased another copy to give to my daughter. I have played this CD more than any other of the 200 or so I own. It features popular songs sung by an artist different from the one who had the hit. ""Cathy's Clown,"" ""The Rose,"" ""It's Only Make Believe,"" and ""Tennessee Waltz"" are my favorites; but they're all good. This is a lot like the ""Common Threads"" album featuring various other artists doing Eagles songs."
3,"A Good Read, But Not What I was Expecting","A Boy I Once Knew is a bit of a miss-titled novel. Although the book is an interesting read, I was expecting a book about the title character and his life journey from the time he was a student to the time he died. Instead, the book focuses primarily on the author who draws parallels between what is happening in the Journals to what is happening in her own life. While sometimes interesting. In that sense it was disappointing, leaving me to wonder about the diaries and what I didn't learn. A more apt title for this book might have been, The Diaries I Received From A Student And How They Made Me Reflect On My Own Life."
1,A Boy I Could Use as an Excuse to Write my Autobiography,"What a tremendous letdown! I picked this up because I loved the thought of the ex-teacher revealing the life of a former student through his memoirs and her memories. Too bad that isn't really the book. Elizabeth Stone uses Vincent as an excuse to write her own autobiography- and believe me, her story makes you long to hear Vincent's all the more. Perhaps his diaries were very vague or his family reticent of having his life detailed - both understandable. But, given that, there isnlt really a worthwhile project here. I got so bored that I kept skipping pages looking to find Vincent's story and all I really kept finding was hers. Ugh! A vanity project all around."
2,a boy i once knew....,"A large brown box appears on the doorstep of teacher, Elizabeth Stone's front door. Inside she would find the journals and inner workings of former student, former human being, former AIDS patient; Vincent.This book was extremely slow going. I felt that it asked too may questions and sort of implied the story rather than to tell it. Yes I am aware that Miss. Stone only had the journals as a reference yet I still believe this work could have been executed in a way as to end up with a much more impressive piece of writing.In reading ""A Boy I Once Knew,"" I also came across a variety of typos and errors thus proving the type of effort that went into the book.Stone also seemed to focus much more on her life than Vincent's, the one she meant to be preserved.When I look at this book as a whole I can't help but wonder if Vincent was made into the person he wanted the world to know. But, at the same time, I don't know if we were properly ""introduced""."
3,"Yep, that's it","Read this after hearing the interviewon First Voice. Often funny, a greatread for those who wonder about""management""The interview is online athttp://www.7to7.net/fnk.htmlThey have transcripts too.--J. R."
5,Book purchase evaluation,The book I purchased was in good shape and was sent quickly. to to to to to to to to
2,Where's the Beef?,"I was disappointed that there was so little helpful information contained in this book. Many of the examples were simply high level overviews of well known business failures. The authors did their best to demonstrate ""Why"" these execs failed, but I think they failed to deliver on ""What"" I could learn from their mistakes. I only made two notes to keep after reading the entire book while on vacation. Bummer..."
4,Great easy to read translation,"The translation is great and is packaged well in this bible, but I do wish I had gotten a version that included study notes as well."
5,Great Introduction to Sustainability Issues,"I found this book to be a great primer and had many examples that I could use to help show the cases for sustainability for clients that were considering implementing and/or growing their sustainability efforts. It is a quick read and drives home the point that a company's efforts should be complimentary to what they ""do"" as a business."
4,A excellent guide to writing windows applications.,"I've been programming in Visual C++ and Visual Basic since 1993, and I found ""Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the Windows Api/Book"" to be a valuable reference manual. Here's what I liked: easy to understand narrative, lots of examples, and a complete structural understanding of windows programming.

4,wonderful movie,great old time movie (1947) where the story is everything and your imagination takes a nice visit to a different place. The special effects are very old time and corny but charming nonetheless. David Niven & Kim Hunter give very good performances. I originally saw this movie on Bravo @ Christmas time about 6-7 years ago and have been looking for it ever since. It was worth the wait.
1,Cheap plastic junk,This product is cheaply made. You can't really tell if the cap on the reservoir is screwed on correct or not. I had to screw the cap off then on probably 3-4x. It feels like the cap might be cross threaded then I figured that must be they way it is. When my dogs would drink all the water out of the dish sometimes it would fill the bowl and sometimes the bowl was dry but the reservoir remained full. I returned this item. It's more hasle than it's worth.
2,meh...stopped using it,This product works as it says it does. It filters water and stores it. The problem is (minus the giant size) is that my cat didn't really like it. He prefers his water dish. I change his water once or twice a day and he likes that much better than the water stored in this fountain.I use a PUR water filter and he enjoys the water that I give him from that over the water filtered in this. Purchasing a PUR filter is more cost effective any way (considering we do not drink botteled water for ethical reasons) and the cat likes it better. I dont need to waste money buying filters for something else.
5,Great product! EXTREMELY big!,I bought the 4.5Qt for my 60lb dog and it is humongous! I could feed two dogs with this bowl. The bowl itself looks great and the rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl from ever sliding. I've never had a spill of any kind. Might be too big for a single dog though.
5,Great size for our Great Danes and Mastiff food,"I love this bowl, I have two huge drooling dogs esp when they eat or drink. These bowls are great in size for their food. They are not to deep as where the dogs head has to go in but deep enough that the dogs do not get the food all over the floor. The best part is the clean up. With the stainless steel the drool comes right off and so does the dries food, as where as plastic you have to scrub it and it still looks dirty these look brand new everytime I wash them, and they do not hold the odor of the dog food like the plactic does. They are also dishwasher safe. I use the 10 qt for their water and it does keep the water cooler as long as its not in the sun, and with the bigger size for water they get more that one drink out of the bowl."
5,Perfect Bowl for Multi-dog household!,"We have three Golden Retriever who, although each have (had) their own water bowls, seem to use and share only one specific bowl all the time. We thus decided to get a single very large capacity bowl that would be the one bowl they all could all share and put it in the same location as the smaller shared bowl they were using. First to say, this bowl is built extremely well and is quite solid in thickness. For under $20, I really expected a lighter gauge shell and this is not the case. The bowl has heft, solidity, nice SS finish and to top it off, has a non-slip rubber base which prevents it from sliding around on the small smooth carpet mat that each dog has. I've seen flimsier bowls locally at PetSmart, Petco and other local pet businesses that cost much more then this bowl and yet, were not anywhere as good in quality. This is a definite 5 star bowl!"
2,"Oh, Dexter","Do yourself a favor...skip this. As a massive fan of the show, I wanted to read Darkly Dreaming Dexter for years. Years! Ugh, major disappointment. I think the main issue is that every single character, save Dexter himself, is inept and one-dimensional. I had serious trouble giving a good goddamn about the story or the people in it and had to struggle to finish it. I definitely won't be reading the rest of the series."
3,"Good, but... if you are watching the show, don't bother with the book.","I'm new to Dexter only recently discovering it on CBS as they started out with season one. I purchased this book in high hopes of the typical book to movie experience. That being that you get a lot more detail out of the book and often times a better story. This book surprised me in that it is EXACTLY like the show. I love the show and was excited to find out that it was based on a novel. ""Based on"" is not true enough of a phrase. This show exactly details the book. I hope the show didn't spend much money bringing in a writer to convert the book to a script. Don't get me wrong... I think this is a good read if you haven't seen the show, but otherwise it is a waste of time."
2,"Thought I'd try the books, but I'm sticking to the show","You have to give the creators, writers, and cast of the Showtime series ""Dexter"" a lot of credit for taking elements and characters from a weak book and turning it into an immensely entertaining show. If I hadn't seen the TV show then I would've hated this book. The author's style frequently alternates between bad poetry and abundantly annoying alliterations (see what I mean?!), the characters are flat, and the storyline goes in different (just stupid) directions than the series. If you've already seen the series then you may want to read ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"" just so you can imagine the actors acting out the scenes in the book and by comparison you'll have a better appreciation of how good the show really is."
3,Okay read,"I love the Dexter Showtime series and I was realy looking forward to reading the book series however I must say I am a little disappointed. It took me a month to finish this book and that's not my usual reading speed. It just didn't capture my attention like the television series. And of course, things are different. I have decided to just stick to the show and I won't be reading the next book."
5,Very Pleased,The books is a great read for fans of the show. The book itself arrived on time in fantastic condition.
3,"Great ideas, but poorly executed","Before I had Showtime, my brother gave me a copy of this book to read. Though I acknowledge, as nearly every other reviewer has, that Dexter is a unique and fascinating character, I found Lindsay's narrative style choppy and uninventive. The storylines are fascinating and and expertly crafted, but Lindsay's overuse of alliteration and unrealistic dialogue, among other things, made this book slightly painful to read. Don't get me wrong; I wasn't expecting iambic pentameter or flowery descriptions. I like quick, straightforward cliff-hangers as much as the next guy. I just feel that Lindsay shortchanged his own ideas and maybe underestimated the intelligence of his readers with the way this is written.Dexter the TV series is awesome...it gets better every season. Watch that instead of reading this."
2,Deeply Disappointing Dexter,"Having watched Dexter Season 1, I decided to read the source novel in preparation for Season 2 coming out on DVD. I was Deeply Disappointed. This is a readable page-turner and most of the core elements of TV Dexter are here, but the novel lacks the depth and wit of the TV adapation. The Dexter, Deb and Harry dynamic is the same and their whole backstory is here, but all the other characters are two-dimensional compared with the TV adaptation. Rita is introduced but falls away after a few appearances, LaGuerta is shallow, Doakes is shallower still, Angel is almost entirely missing, Rita's husband Paul is not here at all, and the character of the Ice Truck Killer / Tamiami Butcher is not well fleshed out (excuse the pun). The charm and personality of Dexter Morgan is present here, but much else is missing. For the best introduction to Dexter... get theDexter - The First SeasonDVD!"
3,I wanted to like it...,"Really, I wanted to like it. I love the TV show, love the concept. But few people can pull of this style of writing. Chuck Palahnuik is one of the who can, and even he has days off.And if you are expecting it be like the show, you are half-right. Much of the plot and style is, but the ending... let's just say things are not quite as Showtime would have you believe."
3,A good supplement to the show,"As a huge fan of the show, I decided to check out the first book in the series, and it's a testament to the show, really, that I much prefer that version. The problem is, for someone who's seen Season 1, that the book is pretty much exactly the same, MINUS a lot. I have more faith in enjoying the second and third books in the series as I know they veer off from the storylines on the show. However, this is not to say this is a bad book - it's interesting and well written - it's just not as good as the show."
2,"Deeply Disappointing, Dexter","I can't remember the last time a book inspired such mixed emotions in me. I was simultaneously charmed by Dexter and bored by the plot. (The television show turned out much the same way.)Dexter is witty, charming, and manages to connect with the reader despite the fact that he's dead inside. Jeff Lindsay's character development with Dexter is brilliant and results in an engaging, endearing serial killer.The plot, conversely, is dull, tired, and uninspired. Not the worst thing I've ever read, but nothing to write home about. I was glad that the length of the book was relatively short -- and it still managed to seem endless at times.Ultimately, I would recommend the book with the caveat that the plot is something you have to get through in order to enjoy the company of Dexter for a few hours."
4,Good Popcorn Book,"This book reminded me of a good summer movie, you eat your popcorn have a good time and leave. This is my first foray into the serial killer genre. Part of the plot reminded me of the movie ""Silence of the lambs"". The main character is intriguing, a serial killer who only kills people who deserve it. This allows you to offer up some sympathy for him. He also has suprise! suprise! a sister who is a cop. The Book is a quick fast paced read. Not great literature but I enjoyed it."
2,To bland not enough action.,"It was just to bland. Not enough action, nothing compared to the ""Dexter"" on t.v.Because of the show I was expecting more blood, gore, and creepy parts. The book failed to engage my nightmares. It seemed to skip over so many parts and I believe that the show had many more (ah) Deep inclination of the breath factor.I'm a little skeptical on buying the next book but since I started it, I will finish it...."
5,A fantastic book,"The book is better than TV series! Excellent to Dexter's fans! Can't wait to buy the second and the third, and... and...lol"
3,The best style but not the best story,"I LOVED Lindsay's style. I loved the humor and the sarcasm and the cynical tone. I didn't love the story as much. For the first time, the TV version is better than the book. Dexter is kind of meek and even clumsy in the book, while the character we all saw in TV is confident and strong."
4,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: I really like the TV series.What impressed me: Dexter is wholly unique. He's such an awesome, messed up, while still being logical, creeptastic, yet average, character. I completely love the entire concept of this series and this first book promises lots of wacky serial killer mayhem in the future.What disappointed me: I watched the show first, which is always a big mistake. The book is great, but I missed out of reading it without any preconceived notions. Totally my fault, but still a little disappointing.Recommended: Absolutely.Continue series: Definitely."
4,"Darkly, sexy, and funny as almighty","Looking to get into the head of a smart, unique but slightly kinked popular man not quite sure why people do what they do? This is a freaking awesome book, far better than the series and just as humorous with twists and flow."
1,No,Nothing like the series. Don't really think it is worth it. My husband didn't like it and he doesn't watch the series.
3,arrived quickly,"good seller, got the item i ordered quickly and the product was in good condition. i thought that the book mark was included with the book but i was mistaken.great book, wish i read it before i watched the series"
3,Ehhhhh,This book is just ok. The tv series is one of the best things on tv. I have never thought the movie/tv show was better then the book...til now.
2,"Love the Showtime series, but....","This is a rare instance. I generally love a book if I like a movie or tv show that is derived from that book, but not this time. It took me about 2+ weeks to get through this book. I'm really glad that it was written (and the rest of them as well) otherwise we wouldn't have Dexter on tv. Perhaps if I had never seen the show, I might have enjoyed the book...."
2,Tedious book to slog through,"I thought this was a tedious book to slog through. It wasn't fast-paced enough for me. I got tired of the repetition. It was interesting to read a story from a psychopath's point of view. (I label Dexter that because he is a killer, albeit of people one could understand, for the sake of the story,need to be killed.) I bought the book for my Kindle because my teenage son had been bugging me to watch the t.v. show online. I thought he would enjoy the book, once we had established it wasn't based on the t.v. show. I read it, but I won't read another one unless the vast, vast majority of the reviews are 5 stars and I get it from the library. To do otherwise would be a waste of my time and my money."
2,"Not The Dexter From ""Showtime""","I purchased this book thinking it would be a continuance of my beloved Dexter from the ""Showtime"" series. If you love blood and gore running rapid this may be for you. I like the characters and how they were established on the TV series. I didn't like the way his sister Deb was portrayed in the book; she knew that Dexter is a killer, how does that fit in with the story line? In this book Dexter doesn't kill his serial killer brother Brian; moreover, he watches as Brian kills LaGuerta, and in the end he lets his brother go. I like Showtime's Dexter character that follows Harry's code and I'll leave the books for those who like a more sinister, evil character."
3,Undecided,"I would have given this 4 stars if not for Dexter's sister Deb. Dexter's narrative was hilarious and even his dialogue with most of the characters was okay, but his sister sounded like somebody from a really, really bad movie. Also, I felt as though a couple of pages were missing towards the ending. If you're worried about the violence, don't be. Lindsay does not go into gory, graphic detail about each death. Not sure if I will read the next installment as Darkly Dreaming was okay, but didn't love it."
5,A refreshing mystery,"I have to admit a novel about a ""good"" serial killer is a bit off putting but Dexter has absolutely won me over. I love his clarity of thought and his ability to see himself for what he is and accept himself. The writing in this novel is crisp and fast-paced and Dexter, although not loveable is a character I look forward to reading about it for some time."
4,Dexter Redux,"This is shaping up as a very nice series. Dexter is a very orginal concept and Lindsay's light amusing touch turns these books into ""Fun to Read"".I have to say I'm finding Dexter's development fascinating. Dexter reminds me of a Miami verson of Parker's Spencer, a wise cracking monster with good values.This is a book to read when you need cheering up or are having problems sticking to one book. You won't be able to put Dexter down. Buy this book and enjoy."
4,Very good. Different from the show but just as good,"I was pleased that this was unique from the show though, I'm pretty sure this was written before the show came out.This takes it's own path and defines the Dexter character differently. Almost darker. It's a good read. I'm very pleased with it.99% of the time, I'd say a book is better then the show. In this case, I'd say the show and book are on equal footing. Both are wonderful and both have kept me engaged. This is a bow to the TV producers and writers more than it is a knock against the book or its' author. I expected the book to be good, but not have the show on it's tail."
4,Book vs Show,"I started reading this series because I'm a huge fan of the show. While reading it, I was delightfully surprised how similar it was to the show, especially with the characters - so kudos to whoever casted it! As you read on, you'll notice some major plot differences between the two and some minor differences that made the book even more interesting to read, just don't expect it to be word-for-word the same as the show. Don't butcher me die-hard-book-fans, but I enjoy the show a tad bit more even though I know it's based off of the books. I just feel the show is a more polished version. Overall, a great read and I bought the second one immediately after I finished it - so that has to count for something."
3,Just like the show,"It's too similar to the show to really be entertaining.If you haven't seen the show, and don't want to, buy this book. If you have seen the show, skip this book the show is better."
5,Here we go,"If you like Dexter, how can you NOT like the books. I still need to get the rest of them but it's definitely going to happen as soon as possible."
3,Entertaining,"I never saw the TV series but I got the book just for fun. It's macabre, morbid, and in a very weird way, funny at the same time. If you live in Miami, or lived in Miami, the book has so many local references that it will make you feel you are there. Almost plausible that it could happen.A very entertaining book."
3,3 1/2 Stars: A Good Book -- But I Expected More!,"After reading the first half of the book, I felt that it was going to deserve a 5-star rating. This was due to Lindsay's providing a fresh, surprising, fast-paced writing style and a rather unique main character. However, once I became accustomed to the novelty of his style and the wittiness of the character, I realized the story was too passive for a story about serial killers and not as exciting as I thought it would be. Further, with the exception of Dexter, all of the other characters are not very well-developed nor are they particularly interesting. While I wasn't disappointed in Darkly Dreaming Dexter, it is not a book that I'd urge you to rush out to read."
3,Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"Trying to mix comedy with horror is a difficult task. Lindsay gives it a good try, but fails to pull it off. I didn't laugh and I didn't cringe.If one has nothing else to read, as sometimes happens to me, this book beats watching ""Survivor"", Donald Trump or Martha Stewart. To tell the truth, I thought ""Sex in the City"" was simply repetious, so one can tell where I am coming from."
1,Not for people who read frequently,"This book is not well written. I really forced myself to try and like it, since I love the Showtime series so much - but this just didn't do it. At all. The characters were flat, bland, with Rita & her kids mentioned just a few times. The Dexter we all know and love does not shine through at all in this - Michael C. Hall does a better job than the written character itself. As an avid reader and major fan of the Showtime show, this book was not for me. Honestly, it's at about a 7th grade reading level."
2,Darkly Dreaming ending,"I bought this book after enjoying the TV series on Showtime. I thought the book and TV would be similar but different, and they are. I like the language the author uses, at least in the first 2/3 of the book. But the book gets just so far and then he hurries up to finish telling the story and the style goes out the window. It's like the author had a page limit he couldn't go past with this story. I've seen similar comments in reviews of the other Dexter books.I've also seen reviews that say the other books are equally similar to the TV show, I was hoping for something more in the books. I don't think I'll bother reading the rest of the Dexter books, but I will watch the show."
4,The TV Show is Better,"If you are looking to read this book because you are hooked on the tv show, then you may be surprised. The book Dexter is a bit more cold and crazy, though still funny at times. What surprised me most is that the tv show was actually better than the book. I can't remember the last time (if ever) that I have come to that conclusion. The story is quite different, but a lot less things happen and before you know it. . . the book is over. I won't be giving away any spoilers, so you'll just have to find out for yourself. I would give the tv show a 5 star rating and the book a 4 star.The one thing I really hated about the book were the constant repetitive ramblings about the fact he is a killer and why he even bothers to pretend. Over and over pages are wasted saying the same thing. By book #2 I am just skipping over these pages."
3,"The show is better. If you saw the show, don't bother.","I don't know if I didn't really care for this book because I saw the series first, or that it isn't a great book. Usually I enjoy reading the book that a series or movie is based on AFTER I see it on screen. I think I enjoy it more because the book usually has more. This one does not.I find the prose pedestrian and simplistic. The dialog is blase and the characters save for Dexter are one-dimensional props to move the plot (what there is of if) forward.It is not a bad book. As a light summer read for sitting by the pool or at the beach, this would be fun. The pages fly by and what passes for a story is easy to keep track of.If you haven't seen Dexter on Shotime, I suggest you do, but then avoid this book. If you haven't seen Dexter yet, start with the book. It will be much better for you."
4,An original and engaging anti-hero,"Having been introduced to the show before even knowing there was a literary basis for it, I had high hopes for this book. I was not disappointed. Lindsay does a superb job of engaging us with his now iconic anti-hero, making Dexter a fully realized human being who is charming and repulsive in almost equal measure. Though some reviewers have expressed a preference for the televised version, I think this book makes a solid companion piece that will fit nicely on the shelf of any fan of the series. I'd also urge anyone who enjoys the deliriously twisted world of Dexter to check out Crimson Orgy, a new novel by Austin Williams that blends dark humor and jolting suspense/horror to great effect."
3,Overrated,"The first half of this book was really good, but it was all downhill from there. It was as if the writer just kind of gave up on the second half, because all of the originality that the first half had was gone. Also, the ending was kinda predictable. I think the show handled the premise much better than this book did."
2,Dissonant Dexter,"Dexter is a sociopath who isn't a sociopath. His moral compass is broken, but it is still there. I couldn't quite buy into the anomaly protagonist that the author tries to explain throughout the story, but at the same time I found the concept intriguing and full of potential.What I didn't find intriguing was the way the author makes almost every other major character in the story a bumbling fool. Perhaps it was to make Dexter shine even more in comparison, or maybe it was to frame the condescending (yet unemotional) perspective of Dexter? Whatever the reason, the story was ultimately a hard sell with such a cast of flaccid personalities.I am hoping that these shortcomings are something that Jeff Lindsay can overcome in future installments, because even with the lackluster initial release, I believe good storylines can be worked around Dexter."
2,Rare case,"I liked the alliteration. However, this book is one of those rare cases where the show ""Dexter"" is much better.Dexter is a lot more rational and sensible. Definately more delicious and thought-provocking. In the show, that is.In the book, it's a bit different. There's a force that drives, rather compels him to kill. Supposedly, it's the dark passenger. In the show, that is something that's within him. He recognizes it as part of himself. In the book, like I said, it's a bit different. A bit of a supernatural aspect drifts into the book.Still, a fun, easy read."
3,Ho Hum,"I got interested in these books after seeing the series on TV, so I bought both of the them. I barely got through the first book. I felt it just ""drug on"", with too much of Dexter's ""thoughts"" and very little action or humor. However, I almost enjoyed the second one and I think maybe I would have enjoyed book 1 more if I hadn't seen the TV series.Having said the above, I think Book 1 was a building block for Dearly Devoted Dexter book 2, which was funny, more action packed and was quicker paced."
5,Best book ever!,"I have to say I wasn't a big reader, until I read this book. I love the t.v. series and thought I would try the book. Here I am hooked. It makes you root for the serial killer to the point you forget he is a bad guy. If you get this book make sure you have the next one ready because it's the kind of story you can't get enough of. If you actually watch the series there are no worries the book doesn't ruin it they are both great in their own way. It is a definite must read for any Dexter fan!"
4,Still enjoyable after watching the series first,"Perhaps I'd have given it a 5 if I had read it before watching the series. Unfortunately, it was hard to shake the characters I've come to know and love from the television. Not all the characters are represented in the same fashion within in the book.However, I know the show came out of the book. And what the book did well was develop the character of Dexter. Usually as readers we don't connect with and essentially fall in love with a serial killer. But Dexter is... different. Endearing? He struggles to fit in and be seen as normal, which many of us have experienced even without such a dark secret such as his.It's hard to call him a bad guy. He has redeeming qualities. And he has a Code that he adheres to.If you enjoy suspense thrillers, police dramas, etc. and are looking for something different - I'd recommend checking this one out"
3,Feel free to skip this novel...,"I watched Seasons 1-3 of Dexter before reading this book. Big mistake.This first book is nearly identical to the first season of Dexter (with a few minor changes [i.e. some people die that remain alive in the show] ). I found it to be incredibly boring since I basically already knew what was going to happen.If you've already watched the first season on Showtime, you won't miss anything by skipping this book and going right into Dearly Devoted Dexter. I'm glad I continued on with the book series, as they get much more interesting after this first book (and the series on TV doesn't follow it at all)."
3,"Dexter, Dexter","Having first heard of this series by watching (and loving!) the show and being a huge crime/thriller novel reader, I thought I had found the perfect new series of books to dive headfirst into. However,I was sadly mistaken. This is one of the few times that the ""movie"" version was better than the book itself. Although Lindsay deserves merit in the idea of Dexter, SHOtime writers should be the ones getting the praise!"
1,execrably written,"From the first clatteringly awful paragraph, through the remainder of the incredibly poorly written first chapter, a potentially interesting and frightening story is transformed into annoying drivel through which I could not skim quickly enough. Perhaps the author should hand over his story ideas to someone possessing some capability with the English language."
5,Dexter...gotta love him!,"I found the concept of this book refreshing. A serial killer who only kills serial killers. I loved the way Dexter talked in the first person, it help to understand what he was thinking and why, plus providing more than a few chuckles along the way. The only disappointment I had was not finding anotherDexter book. I hope Jeffry Lindsay lets us hear from Dexter soon."
3,Hannibal Lector - move over!!!,"This book scared the beeheyseuss out of me. Not since Hannibal has there been a scarier lead. Dexter has wonderful sarcasm and obviously the only ones he really cares about are his sister and all children.This was one weird book but I was sitting thru one weird hurricane Frances. With the wind howling outside and no electricity I plowed on trying to finish it before darkness arrived.It was interesting because Dexter had some redemption at the end, leaving it open for a 2nd 'Dexter'. Thank heaven it was a short book. I dont know how to feel about this book. At least I finished it and felt halfway good about the ending. Hell, I feel good about getting my electricity back on after 7 hours w/o it."
4,Darkly Dreaming Dexter,"The book arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner, but just wasn't for me. It was interesting but I was expecting something a little different. However, if you like dry, macabre humor, this is the book for you!"
2,no depth to dexter,"If you want a quick and easy crime read, then you should enjoy ""Dexter"". However, if you are looking for a skillfully crafted, plot twistin' good time, move along. Once the ""serial killer that kills serial killers"" idea sets in the story drags and lacks the depth it needs to make you want to read more."
4,The only good book in the series,I really enjoyed reading this book as the rest seemed to have gotten worse. It's semi-consistent with season one and worth a read.
4,Good book,Was an easy read. It was a required read but I would read it anyway. Kept me interested the whole time.
3,I'll try the show,"I have never seen the show, but reading the reviews, it sounds like one of those rare instances where the show is better than the book. I found this book to be just okay. It has such an intriguing premise I figured I wouldn't be able to put it down, yet I was VERY able to put it down. Dexter came off as creepy and not nearly as likeable as I would have expected for this type of guy. I mean, if you are going to try to humanize a serial killer, you better make me want to grab a beer with him and have some laughs. The Dexter in the book was no such character to me. I thought he was creepy, insecure, and weird. The pace was a lot slower than I expected as well.I'm not saying this is a horrible book, but since reading it I haven't recommended it to anyone, and probably won't."
1,Terrible,"The concept of the books is really interesting. I was so sure I would like it, that I bought 3 books in the series before I ever read the first one. I found the first one a huge disappointment. Great Idea, but poorly thought out and executed. Very little original imagination. Just dumb. I would say this is one of the worst books I have ever suffered through and definately will not waste the time on the other two I have, unfortunately, already bought."
3,Keep Your Eye on This Series.,"I loved the concept of this book: Serial killer with a (somewhat shaky) moral compass. Dexter is a sociopath who has learned to mimic human behavior and fake his own humanity even as he indulges his ""Dark Passenger"". It's an intriguing premise with an oddly likable anti-hero. So there's great potential here. But, there's a problem.It can be difficult to get a good sense of supporting characters in a first person novel. When the first person narrator is a self-professed sociopath who doesn't bond or connect with other humans, it can be near impossible. Everyone but Dexter (and possibly, the ever practical Harry) is flat and one-dimensional in this novel. The reader can't bond with any of the supporting characters, much less the victims, because Dexter can't. What we're left with is an engaging and interesting protaganist, a plot that intrigues and is well paced but very little emotional investment in, or satisfaction from, the story. But then, maybe that's the point?"
5,A Darkly Fresh Perspective,"I've been watching the TV show for several years and finally got around to reading the book. Definitely worth the read even if you have seen the show. What I love about this book is that the focus is mostly on Dexter's thoughts and perspectives as he tries to navigate through everyday life. Harry's Code is the set of rules by which Dexter lives and it helps him to fit in and appear normal. Watching Dexter live by his code (which some people would find horrifying) and also watching apparently ""normal"" people who follow the letter of the law but intentionally damage other people for personal gain is good food for thought over what makes anyone a ""good person."" Overall, this is great writing that is often witty and never dull."
2,Worth reading once.,"Dexter is an very intriguing character. It's a shame that the author is not better at fleshing out and conveying his creation. The alliteration gets a little bit wearing after a while, and a character as dynamic as Dexter wouldn't sound like a sixth grader in his internal monologues. I am still going to give the next couple of books a try, it's possible they will get better as the author gains experience and better gets to know his character."
3,If you enjoy a good book; skip this one.,I give this book three stars only because of the potential it has to be great. The Of course it would need an entire rewrite. The book is full of jokes that fall flat. I was especially annoyed with Dexter's internal dialog. I honestly found myself annoyed with the author while reading this. I expected to find a little more depth than the series. I was sorely disappointed. The book is shallow and inconsistent.
5,"Dexter is the boy-killer next door, but with a nice streak","Dexter is a seriel killer, that kills seriel killers. Dexter is haunted by the Dark Passenger that rides along in his brain with him. When it is time to take care of things the Passenger takes over. However some new crimes that he gets called to start looking like his own work. Oh did I mention Dexter works for the police as a blood splatter analysis expert?These crimes seem so familar and he starts having dreams that tie into the crimes. He is sleepwalking and killing, what is going on?"
4,Read it then watch it,"I read this and another of the Dexter books when I first saw commercials for the TV show. Thought the books were great. Cool idea for a character, a serial killer blood-spatter cop. Glad I read the books before watching the show because I like the show better."
5,The original Dexter!,"I am a huge Dexter fan. If you are discovering Dexter because of the TV show, you will be pleasantly surprised as the books do differ in the plot than the TV show!Dexter is the serial killer you root for, as he tracks down really bad guys and disposes of them in a way the police cannot!"
4,Review of Darkly Dreaming Dexter,This was a very clever book. It was very insightful as to the view of a sociopathic mind. I thought it was very interesting the way the author tied in past events to create a personality unlike no other we see today. Definately an interesting read.
2,"Strong start, weak finish","Jeff Lindsay writes well. He's fun to read. Unfortunately, his plot development doesn't stand up to his writing abilities. Anyone can pull a rabbit out of a hat to solve a mystery which is exactly what Lindsay does here. He solves the mystery by introducing a new character with just pages to go. I felt cheated and disappointed. Perhaps his other books are better, but I doubt I'll take the time to find out. P.S. Is there really such a thing as a blood splatter expert?"
4,Terribly twisted tidbit,"Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a great gory good time. Not for everyone I'm sure, some might find his chosen calling callous, or really rather repulsive, but he's awfully, artfully amusing."
1,showtime version >>> lindsay version.,i first watched the showtime show dexter and became a fan. usually the books are better but this book BLOWS. its readable but a waste of your time. lindsays ending is terrible and does not do justice to dexters character. i want my money back.
4,Deftly Deliberate Dexter,"I just finished Darkly Dreaming Dexter and feel definitely drained. I can't remember the last time I've read a novel whose slide down from the climax didn't end exactly as I'd imagined. I found myself reading the last few pages as rapidly as I'd read the first gruesomely delicious chapter. I will admit that through the middle of the book, narrator Dexter's self-involved musings caused the flow to drag decidedly, but that's just dear demented Dexter. Can't wait for the next novel featuring Dexter. I want to see how he handles his protagonist Sergeant Doakes."
3,An interesting debut,"Lindsay has created an innovative plot and a most surprising hero. Dexter is a serial killer who because of the intervention of his policeman adoptive father has become different than your typical serial killer. The father challenged his killing instincts and directed those same instincts into somewhat more ""noble"" paths. Thus, Dexter only kills those serial killers who have done evil. Makes an interesting twist to ""an eye for an eye.""The plot concerns his hunt for an enigmatic serial killer who is frighteningly similar to Dexter himself. The ending strains one's credibility; at least this reader's.The writing is witty and it is certainly possible that this author will improve over the course of future books."
4,Very Different!,"After reading previous reviews, I was curious to see how a novel of a self-proclaimed serial killer could work. I definitely think it works! Dexter is a very different protagonist, emotionally scarred from childhood and the reason is revealed to us. I do wish the author had delved deeper into Dexter's thought processes and the other characters. I do look forward to the author's next Dexter book."
2,Painfully Predictable Dexter,"This book is interesting, and well-written, and a pleasure to read. Dexter's POV perspective is engaging, thought-provoking, and amazingly believeable. That being said... the plot of this book is like it was written by Charlie Kaufman's fake twin brother from Adaptation, for god's sake. Anyone who's ever watched an episode of a mystery show or read a single mystery book will see the end of this a million miles away, and groan. If someone came up to you on the street and held a gun to your head, and asked you for the plot of this book based on this premise, this is what you'd blurt out. I hope the second one has a better plot - otherwise, these just are just clever gimmicks without much substance or subtext."
1,this is original?,"A serial killer who helps the police solve murders?? Didn't we have that character last millenium in Hannibal Lecter?? And like Lecter's creator Thomas Harris, Jeff Lindsay becomes an apologist for serial killers with logic that goes something like this: ""If you've been badly abused as a child, and you attempt to appease your homicidal psychoses created by this abuse by killing people that you deem worthy of death by torture, then it's acceptable to be a serial killer."" PLEASE!! Harris made a mistake when he tried to rationalize the monster Lecter's bestial nature by explaining it away as the result of torture by the Nazis. Lindsay tries to convince the reader to wallow in his psychopath's unapologetic killings by turning him into a nihilistic crimefighter. Neither explanation works.I only made it through the first third of the book, so if I missed some major shift in character later on, others will doubtless take me to task."
1,a really stupid book,"dexter is one of the most unbelievable ideas ever developed and shows how hard up the publishers are for new material. it is so stupid that even matt damon wouldn't star in it. there is no plot, no seriously believable characters, numerous plot tangle ups, and a fabulously poor ending. i mean, can you really think that a scientist for the cops does cut up murders on the side, and no one suspects?? and that his sister also a cop just looks the other way?? this is total crap and most likely will never even wind up in a low grade comic book.david g sutliff"
1,Appaling!,"First of all, I confess to having read only the first chapter. It was recommended by a librarian whom I repect. While the author appears to be an original thinker, I cannot see any reason to waste my time on such material when there are other books more worthy of my attention. Call me a snob, but this sort of writing, to say nothing of the subject and its hero, is beyond my capacity to enjoy on any level.What really gob-smacked me was a ""collector"" hardback for $225 (as I recall).Nancy Eckert"
2,Dexter is better on TV unfortunately...,"Great story line, wonderful characters and setting, problem is, it is not written well at all!! Jeff Lindsay has a great imagination, but terrible writting ability, almost painful to read. If I had not watched the Showtime series and enjoyed it so much, I would not be able to read the book. Truth be told, I am having trouble with it regardless."
1,Good premise can't save bad writing,"Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, I'm not generally a reader of murder/suspense books. I picked this up because I thought the premise was interesting and read some decent reviews. A serial killer who goes around killing other, ""bad"", serial killers. Could be great, right?The premise is good, but the writing is just terrible. I couldn't even finish it. I get it -- the narrator (Dexter) has no real feelings but he can fake them really well. He doesn't recognize/acknowledge other people's realities, only his own. How do I know this? Because the author tells me this (in pretty much these exact words) over and over again starting on page 1. A little bit of ""Show, don't tell"" would have made a world of difference here.It's too bad, I really wanted to like it."
4,"Dark, different, and delightful",Dexter is a great character. Definitely different from your usual protagonist. I found myself charmed and creeped out all at once. I look forward to the sequel. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I found the ending less than great; but I still recommend it highly.
5,Wicked ending.,"Compared to the show the ending was probably better. Still not as exciting but I still really enjoyed it and look forward to reading the next. Dexter is more insane in the book as well, hard to believe."
5,Amazing,Such an intense read!! A very big page turner. Jeff Lindsay is such a great author. Can't wait for book 2!
3,TV Series MUCH BETTER then book!,I did not like the story at all. The TV Series was much better developed. Not believable. The book as an item was ok of course.
2,"Interesting Idea, But Little Substance","DDD is an interesting novel. Our main character is not a police officer wrangling against prejudiced superiors and nasty street thugs to find the criminal--he's a criminal himself. As a criminal, his Camus-like approach to life and relationships make this character hard to like and believe. Lindsay clearly has a knack for comedy and sarcasm, and Dexter is a perfect voice to add color to an otherwise shallow plot.The other characters are very flat and trite. The plot doesn't really work, and there's a touch of made-for-TV twists in the story that make the reader a bit embarrassed that Lindsay didn't think this one through more thoroughly. I won't be likely to read the next installment in the series."
2,Great Idea. Poor Implementation.,"I really wanted to like this book. The idea is great--very original and funny in a dark, dark way. The book starts off in an interesting way and Dexter is an intriguing character I wanted to get to know. However, the other characters in the book are mere charicatures. None of them act like real human beings. Even Dexter is a bit flat. I never really understood why he did what he did or believed that someone like Dexter could actually be so coherent in conveying his thoughts to the reader. Still, the plot kept me going. I wanted to see where it was going. But the ending of this novel was just awful. It was both obvious and completely unbelievable. I was pretty disappointed in this book because I think the premise is much stronger than the delivery."
3,Interesting idea marred by poor characters and ending,"As a big fan of Bradley Denton's ""Blackburn"" and ""One Day Closer to Death,"" the idea of a serial killer who actually works for the police was quite intriguing. While Dexter was an interesting character (his back story involving his adopted father was very well done), the remaining characters were very shallow and contrived and the ending was very, very weak (more like a movie of the week or ""Days of Our Lives"").I am curious to see some more of Dexter, but more work is needed on plotting and supoporting cast."
3,far less entertaining than the Showtime series,"Well, I've read the book after having seen all the 6 first seasons. I must admit that I'm a bit disappointed by the book even though you understand slightly more about the character personality.But believe me the TV series is very well adapted.Back to the book, I would say if you're a Dexter fan you surely want to read it (and probably read all the Jeff Lindsay books) just to have more info about him. Otherwise don't bother reading and definitely go for the Showtime's Dexter."
3,simply creepy.,"its so hard to give friends books like these, you want to describe the sickness and awesomeness of these books but you cant! and you want your friends to enjoy it so badly! the dexter from the books is much different than the tv show dexter. The books convey dexters dark passenger almost as a dark-psychic-creature. Very interesting, more so than the show."
5,Dexter is totally different,I have never read anything like Dexter. The other reviews cover the book very well. I never heard of the television program. I really enjoyed this very different character. I have purchased the second book and will read it soon.
3,"Fantastic idea, but the TV series is actually much better than the books","It was so cool to compare the book to the series (which I love) although I must say the series is a lot more clever.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
4,Helped answer some questions,"I suffer from cronic migraines. I have been seeing my doctor, but havn't been getting the answeres I've needed. This book helped me understand what was going on, what to look for, and even gave me ideas on what to do differently. It also gave me ideas of what i'm going to mention during my next visit to my doctor. My mother also suffers from migraines, and I have a few friends and do also. I have had no problem inviting them to read my book."
5,"Fun, informative and a tasty read","If you love chocolate, and like to read a bit about history, business strategy and marketing - this book hits the spot.This book has changed my perspective on the candy machine, when I look at all the different candies standing at attention in their places, I think: Which one is a Mars or Hershey creation? Which one was a recipe brought over from the old country and eventually was purchased by one of the giant companies? Which one is based on a dog food marketing strategy? Which one is considered to be 'sour' chocolate by the Europeans? Which one has a burnt carmel under taste?This was a very satisfying read, though I think I might have gained weight by just reading it!"
5,A Sweet Book,"The Emperors of Chocolate was a very insightful book on not only the companies of Hershey and Mars, but of the general chocolate scene throughout history as well. It is one of those books that seems to lock you into your chair and never want to put down. Joel's writing style was also very captivating. An excellent read and a must-have for anyone with a sweet tooth for fine writing."
4,THE EMPERORS OF CHOCOLATE,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY GOOD IN ILLUSTRATING THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY INDUSTRIES BETWEEN HERSHEYS AND MARS. IT GIVES DEPTH INFORMATION ON RAVALRY,THE MAKING OF CHOCOLATE, AND THE STRAGETIES. IF YOUR A CHOCOLATE FANATIC THIS IS YOUR BOOK."
5,One helluva read -- this is much more than a business book,"The Emperors of Chocolate reads like a gripping novel. It's a page-turner like no other business book since Barbarians at the Gate. Brenner pulls you into this secretive, bitter world and never lets up. Full of fascinating facts about candy, about business, about the men who brought chocolate to the masses -- this book is for anyone who likes a great biography and a great read. You'll never look at the candy aisle the same way again!"
5,Chocolate Wars,"I think that this book was very interesting. It made me have a different idea on how candy (especially chocolate) is made. There were many interesting facts that I did not know before reading this book. For example, Mars does not only make candy, but also sells dog food and pizza in other countries."
5,A Sweet Treat,The Emperors of Chocolate tells the tale of America's two largest and most famous chocolate industries: Hershey's and Mars'. The book depicts how very different the two companies are while competing for the same consumers. I think the book focuses on how two companies on opposite side of the spectrum can both be at the top of their game: chocolate. The book is not merely for people in the business world but for anyone who wants to know how M&Ms get printed or what the environmental impact is from harvesting cocoa or why a product is introduced and then disappears so quickly. I really enjoyed this book and would recomend it to anyone.
4,Hershey v. Mars,"The cover of the book caught my eye -- as a chocoholic, the kisses grabbed me. Then I began reading, and the stories behind the candy empires pulled me in. The book was well written and well researched. It gives a fascinating peek into the history of the American candy industry, as well as the competition between the two companies. I'll never look at a Hershey's Kiss or a Snickers the same way again. The editting could have been a little better -- some information was presented on several occasions and was redundant. But this was a fantastic book."
3,This Book Wasn't That Bad,"The Emperors of Chocolate was a good book. When I first got the book, I thought it would be just a bunch of graphs, scales and statistics because I got it for my economics class, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I started reading it with no idea what to expect of it and I did think it was going to be really boring. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes candy. This was a great book about Mars and Hershey and some of the history of chocolate and also gives the secret of how they put the M on the M&M. I thought I wasn't going to enjoyed reading this book but it let me find out all about the chocolate business."
5,The Emperors of Chocolate,"The Emperors of Chocolate tells the story of how Milton Hershey and Forrest Mars battled for the stomachs of chocolate consumers all over the world. When i came into this book i was expecting to learn about the exciting minds of Milton Hershey, and Forrest Mars and how they rose to the top of this industry. After reading this book i learned more then i expected about the two multi-million dollar corporations. The author Joel Glenn Brenner does a great job of exploiting the differences between the two industry tyrants.I highly recomend that anyone who is trying to learn about the great entrepreneurial skills that it takes to start a business read this book"
4,Intriguing to say the least.,"The book sets out to explore two of the world biggest candy giants, Hershey and Mars. It goes far beyond that, exploring elements of humanity and the worlds obsession with chocolate. The book is far from boring and almost everything about the two companies is fascinating. Did you know that the companies will not divulge any information about their operations and do not talk to the press...everything is kept quiet. Mars is a family owned business, one of the wealthiest in the world and the Hershey profits support one of the world's largest orphanages.It is an interesting read if the topic interests you. The book is full of interesting facts and stories. The book will shock you and you will be very surprised at what the book has to offer. I would recommend this book to anyone just for fun."
4,This is a Pretty Good Book,"The Emperors of Chocolate was a great book.I was required too read it for Economics at my high school but when I was reading it, it didn't feel like something I was reading for school.It was more an intrest book for myself.This book keep me wanting to read more of it and it also made me want to know about the Candy industry-the business side and the creator side.Techniques they discuss in this book are unbelieveable.You wouldn't believe that was the way many chocolate companies were started.This is a book people should read if their a chocolate lover or want to get into the business."
4,A Sweet Treat To Read,"The Emperors of Chocolate is a great book that keeps the reader salivating for more. Joel Glenn Brenner offers an opportunity for readers to understand how hard competition is for two chocolate companies. This book portrays the most competitive candy companies as bitter businesses, who are not satisfied with the billions of dollars they make. Although these companies share the same product, both Mars and Hersheys use creative ways to appeal to customers with different types of chocolate. These companies are always willing to keep their chocolate customers happy and anyone who is a fanatic of Mars or Hersheys will enjoy reading this book."
5,Simply superior book on the enterprising of chocolate.,"As a Hershey fanatic, I found this book to be very interesting and informative. It was easy to pick up and continue reading about the Hershey and Mars enterprises, as well as the other chocolate makers. This book had many startling facts and figures with outstanding interviews with those involved in building the companies such as the Mars brothers, CEO's and line staff in the factories. This is one book that I am sure I will read again and again."
3,"A quick, entertaining read- and nothing more.","I found this to be a well-written and entertaining book, to an extent. In particular, the chapter regarding the impersonal offices and obsessive quality control at the Mars Company was a great perspective. However, the book just fell short for me. I would have rather seen the author interpret the overall picture instead of narrating a tale. The way it was written caused the book to become out of date so quickly after it was published, considering recent events of the battle between Nestle and Hershey. I was also a bit weary of the author's references- the most up to date information of the Mars Company was from a 1989 interview, which leaves an absence of information for the next 10 years. Overall, I found the book to be an easy read and bit repetitive, but informative (up to a point)."
4,The Emperors of Chocolate,"the book the Emporers of chocolate was very interesting, I was never previously aware that there were two companies who dominated the candy scene-Mars and Hershey. 8/10 of the top rated candy bars in America, fall under either of these two companies. Because these two companies are in a league of their own in terms of competition, the battle is fierce yet not seen to the public. Each company is very protective of their image, and that is what makes his book so interesting. You are taken behind the scenes and actually shown why. I thought it was very interesting that in the last 100 years that the amount of sucessful candy companies has dwindled from in the thousands to a mere 150. Who knows what this may be in the next 10 years, but this book helps show what may come in the future."
4,A Tale Of Two Cities,"...the Two Cities being the Corporations of Hershey and Mars. Hershey is like Athens, Mars is like Sparta.This is a book chock-filled with scrumptious tidbits (sorry, couldn't help myself) about chocolate, the candy industry, and most of all the histories, families, and corporate cultures of America's two largest candy companies: Hershey and Mars.Hershey built a Utopian town. The passion of his life was an orphanage. Mars? His kids didn't eat M&Ms; growing up because their father couldn't spare any. How their corporate paths merged and clashed is a fascinating tale of opposite business styles, both of which have been successful at various times.A very entertaining book, You'll feel like you've consumed something much more substantial than a candy bar..."
3,It was a delight reading,"Before i read this book, i had no idea about businesses and competitions. My first impression on this book was that it was too thick and looked sweet. i liked the cover of the book. it attarcted my tastebuds. Honestly, the context was not very attarcting for a non business people like me. But it introduced several interesting materials. For example, the competition on non melting chocolate bar, and question on the letter ""M"" on M&M chocolate. i didn't enjoying reading it, but it showed me interesting parts on business and what makes business exciting. I would like to offer this book to those who are on business field or those who are curioused on the chocolate industry."
4,Who knew chocolate was so secretive,"A great insight into a fascinating industry. The chocolate wars offer the same cloak and dagger secrecy as the cola wars, probably to a higher degree. This book does a great job of intertwining the history of Hershey and Mars.One of the neatest parts of the book was reading about how certain brands developed. It was also surprising to read how much the rest of the world hates Hershey's Chocolate (too sour)."
4,Inside the world of Hershey and Mars,If you enjoy the wonderful treats that Hershey and Mars brings into this world as much as I do you will find this book quite fascinating. This book is like a VIP backstage pass into the world of chocolate that you never thought had existed. This book unraveles the story of Hershey and Mars in extaordinary detail.
4,Review,The book reveals all the bitter legal and marketing fights between the two large corporations. Throughout we here of the bitter battles including one with the us milittary that the Hershey Corporation fought for until the very end even after they had formaly lost the contract. The book showed that sometimes these battle were not fought just for money but for the principal of the matter invloved. Overall the book is very informative and contains a wide weatlh of knowledge.
4,Chocolate will never be the same again...,"Very interesting story and history on how the chocolate industries begin in America, and some of the untold secrets and success of these major players. The book also talks about how new technology is being rapidly being introduce in the industry as part of the ever increasing demand for new products as well as to keep up with fellow competitors for market share. Gives you sufficient insight into chocolate world, which will make you take another look when you pick up a bar of chocolate or notice how the silent chocolate wars are taking place around the world no matter where you are."
1,Oops--this was supposed to be a Sweet Valley book,"This is one of the stupidest books I've ever read. I love SVH and SVU, and I started reading Sweet Valley twins when I was in the fourth grade. I am now a college student, and this book was horrible. Not only is it soap-opera like in the way that William White NEVER DIES, but Jessica is portrayed like a complete airhead. And didn't Alison die in an earlier Thriller? I know the thriller and super editions never continue what's going on in the series, but they should at least be true to what went on in previous thrillers. Anway, my advice to Francine Pascal is STOP William White. Now I have to decide if I want to torture myself with part II to find out what happens. I've already almost bought it twice, but then I remembered how bad part one was, and I left it on the shelf."
3,How Many Times Are They Going To Bring Back William White??,"I didn't find this book very exciting, it could have been better in my opinion. I don't like the return of William White, how could he have survived the accident?? Enough of William White."
3,"Halfway decent, but disappointing...","I felt that this book was kind of disappointing. It has nothing to do with what's currently happening in the series (Jessica's trying to pick up guys and everything's going great for Elizabeth and Tom)and everyone's personality even seems different (Tom acts like a total jerk). Still, it was intriguing and the continuation will probably be much better."
4,An Amazing Thriller,"Although I find Elizabeth a little over dramatic about William White dying and all, I think the suspense and the fantasy cyber dreams in the book are just great! :) IT WILL KEEP U READING!"
4,Must Have for Jason Fans,"Eric Morse's Friday the 13th's Mother's Day is the first book in his four book Friday the 13th series, in which Morse discusses what happens after Jason goes to Hell. In this book, the question of what ever happened to Jason's mother is answered! This alone makes the book worth the money. Morse, with his writing, is actually able to catch the essense of the movies in these books, allowing them to transend being ""just for kids"" to the rank of must have for any Jason or slasher fan! Morse will make you feel that you are actually in the book, that is how well he writes. Don't question yourself about the purchase, I guarantee that if you really liked the movies, you will love the books. They are a great lead into the upcoming release of Jason X!!!"
4,Just as promised. Quick and easy delivery,I ordered this book for my boyfriend's Christmas and it arrived three days after ordering in good condition. Can't wait to see his face when he sees it under the tree.
5,Solid overview of US cultural history from 1946-1962,"Whitfield's book serves as a succinct overview of American Cold War culture, which he defines as ending in the early 1960s (a questionable decision but one made by many scholars who employ the ""Cold War Culture"" rubric).What sets apart this book from other entries in the literature is Whitfield's recognition of the importance of religion to Cold War America and his willingness to grapple with the Cold War's full range of moral implications (an element lacking in most academic studies of the domestic side of the Cold War, which tend to fixate endlessly on McCarthy, who is used to tar and discredit all variants of American anti-Communism). This is not to suggest that Whitfield is an apologist for McCarthy, not at all, but to commend Whitfield for understanding that, to paraphrase Arthur Koestler, the Cold War was the story of the United States fighting for a half-truth against a total lie."
5,Perfect Black and Tan Every Time,I tried other methods to achieve the perfect Black and Tan and I wasn't always successful. This spoon makes it so that you get the perfect Black and Tan EVERY TIME! I was hesitant for a long time in getting this. I tried with other regular spoons but the trick is that this spoon is flatter. Unbelievable how that alone makes a difference....I was skeptical before I got it. I highly recommend it...so worth it.
1,plunger breaks easily,"The plunger screen has broken after 4 months of use, yes the beaker is non-breakable but if the screen breaks this easily it is no different than the glass units I have been disappointed with."
2,Beware the metal screws in the handle,"The manual says it's safe to use in the microwave if the metal parts are removed. It doesn't mention there is (somewhat hidden) metal in the handle, and this metal in handle melted hole in carafe the first time I used it. Looks like a nice device, wish I had a chance to actually use it."
3,Worked great for 3 months then filter broke,"Got this 8-cup polycarbonate ""unbreakable"" french press as xmas gift. Worked great for 3 months then filter cracked assembly cracked in half. Read prior reviewers comments about it breaking so was very careful, didn't use dishwasher, wasn't rough with it, still broke. Manufacturer said I can swap it for a new one but may need to pay shipping. Metal and glass may be a better idea...."
2,Unbreakable - but at cost to health?,"I have been shopping for a french press - and almost pulled the trigger. Buyer beware. This plastic press is made of polycarbonate. Since the press was put in the market, we know that Polycarbonates and hot liquids do not mix. Leaching BPA's into your system every day. I know the technology is there - so I hope they upgrade their model to a non-BPA plastic. I'm not the paranoid type - at all. But this is really a no-brainer."
1,BonJou 8 cup unbreakable frenc press,"Funny they should call it unbreakable. The only thing unbreakable is the container itself. The screen broke shortly after I purchased this unit. I would say: Do not buy!! It's too bad the manufacture does not fix this problem. The coffee tastes good, but it sure doesn't last.BonJour Hugo 8-Cup Unbreakable French Press, Black"
2,The unbreakable breaks,"This seems like a great french press at first. it is all plastic, so it seems unbreakable. However, the screen on the inside simply falls apart over time. I have had two of these products, one lasted me 6 months and the other lasted me about 2 months. the plastic around the screen simply falls apart. I think the coffee breaks it down somehow. I can no longer recommend this product. I'm trying the bodum original now, and it seems to be pretty good so far."
1,BonJour coffee press waste of money,"BonJour coffee press is a terrible product. Poorly designed. Sure the carafe is unbreakable, but what does break into pieces is the plastic piece used to press down the coffee grinds. This happened within one month of purchase. I returned the press (I paid the shipping, which was high), received a replacement, and again within less than a month the same part broke. Obviously can't handle the heat and pressure. Of course customer service claims this has never happened before. But for the identical part on two different presses to break? Come on. Save your money and do not buy this product. The Bodun is infinitely better, as its press part is metal. Should have bought that one in the first place and not wasted my money."
2,"Unreliable, in my opinion","I've had a few problems with this one:1. There are 3 larger cut-outs in the screen, so if the screen rotates wrongly (as it will, when the bolt loosens), coffee gets through the screen. I guess a courser ground than supermarket coffee that is pre-ground would work better. I had to keep fishing out grounds from my cup.2. The bolt in the plunger loosens.3. My bottom disk on the plunger broke apart after 9 months of repeated (almost daily) use."
1,"poor design, not worth the money","I have owned this for a week, and sure enough, the plunger broke. It wouldn't screw into the screen, like it was stripped. I have owned a metal coffee press for at least 10 years and it still works. I have been looking for a metal press and haven't found one so I bought this knowing I would break a glass press. Well, I'm still looking."
1,This is really crappy,I used this for 1 month and the plastic press pieces broke into multiple unusable pieces. This is the worst piece of crap I have ever bought.
2,"Unbreakable Carafe - Sure, but ....","Bought this product one month ago. I absolutley loved the coffee that came out of it. But today the filter frame (at the bottom of the press) disintegrated. The plastic frame that holds the screen filter began crumbling due to small cracks and flakes of plastic that made the coffee press unusable.I quickly searched for a replacement part, but found all I can replace is the screen or the carafe (Why? I thought it supposed to be unbreakable). So, I'm out $20 plus shipping.Recommendation to prospective consumers: spend an extra $20 and get a better quality press with steel filter frame."
1,Avoid BonJour,Poor quality coffee result and cheaply made. Get what you pay for. Avoid this product.
1,Absolutely Terrible,This broke the VERY FIRST TIME I used it. Words alone cannot express what a terrible product this is.
2,"Unbreakable, until broken.","This press functioned well when operated. I brought it to a class to serve classmates and it received much praise. There was no off-taste from the plastic and the grounds stayed firmly in place and not in my mouth. After a couple washes, the story changed. The black, plastic bottom lip would fill with water and, eventually, fell off completely. It was held on with glue. Soon after, the mesh component of the actual press mechanism fell off.I wouldn't recommend it."
1,DON'T buy this,"Seriously, don't do it. I read the reviews and most of them said it was sturdy and I did read about a problem with the plastic piece on the plunger. I had mine for three weeks (I bought it because it was called unbreakable) and the plastic piece that houses the plunger broke out of nowhere! Sure the container is unbreakable, but the rest of it is junk!"
1,Unbreakable SHOULD MEAN unbreakable,"As with so many of the other reviewers of this product, I bought this French press with the idea that it would be unbreakable. The carafe part does hold up, but the press is lame, flimsy, and poorly made. I bought two of these and both have broken. I hate products that don't deliver what they promise."
4,Smelled like a rubber boot,"Works fine, what can go wrong with a french press. The rubber base smelled like a tire and took several washings to get rid of the odor"
1,Not Recommended,"I have been using a French Press to brew coffee for years, 3-4 times a day. I bought this one for the occasional larger pot. I use it about 4 times a week. After only about 7 months, the rubber seal was pulling out of the plastic support pieces of the plunger. I took it apart and found two of the plastic locator nubs broken, even though it had never been apart before. I had usually hand cleaned the unit with a few drops of dish detergent and hot water by plunging the filter through the suds. Anyway, I noticed the rubber uneven again last night. A close inspection showed the plastic plunger pieces broken or cracking. The plastic had lost all of its strength and would fall apart in my hands. I have decided - no more plastic. It may not be healthy anyway, and I suspect something leached out of the plastic for this change to have occurred."
2,Breakable.,The carafe is not breakable. The cheap plastic filter however is. And it broke very easily.I'm buying a different one. Blah.
1,"Definitely not ""unbreakable""","I purchased one of these on Sept. 29, 2008. After using it for 4 months (about twice a week), the filter assembly broke along one of the plastic ribs. In my humble opinion, that's poor design quality. If I purchase another french press, it will not be this one. I don't care if the carafe is made out of ""unbreakable"" polycarbonate. If the filter assembly falls apart with light usage, I'll go with a glass carafe and a plunger that will last more than 32 uses."
2,French press BonJour,I loved this press for about 2 weeks and then the plastic inside the press cracked and broke and now I have coffee full of grounds.
2,Disappointed,"I liked this for the same reason as others: the bottom sits flat and the filter is one solid piece, so grounds don't get stuck in hard to clean spots. However, I didn't do anything harsh to this (haven't dropped it, put it in the dishwasher, used a metal spoon) and the week after I got it coffee started seeping out of a crack in the bottom. I'm going back to Bodum."
1,Not everything is unbreakable!,I bought this French press for my husband for his birthday and he used it once a day. Within 2 months the plastic plunger started cracking. Today it broke into 3 pieces! Also the plastic that holds the screen is not holding up well. Now I'm contemplating replacing it with Frieling 0103 5-6 Cup French Press. You can view the broken Bonjour Press by clicking on photos.
3,"Mine broke quickly too, but...","My Bonjour unbreakable press broke too, at the plastic retainer where the screen is held (like the other reviewers). I liked it until it broke. I admit I was using fine ground coffee, which was a bad idea - you must use coarse! Perhaps if you are careful about this you will have better luck.For those of you seeking a superior sturdy press, I recommend the Bodum Young Press 34-Ounce, which is more expensive and nicer - it has a glass carafe in a plastic shell so it is heavier and keeps coffee warmer longer (and perhaps also is more breakable?). Interestingly, all the parts between these two seem compatible, so I was able to create a light-weight hybrid by moving the all-metal screen assembly onto this Bonjour unbreakable body - great for camping!"
2,"BonJour, Ya it breaks","This product was nice for the three months I had it, then the plasic around the plunger screen broke off at randome. It is currently unusable."
1,"Polycarbonate leaches BPA, and you want to brew in it?","Much as I like the idea of unbreakable, it was the polycarbonate being used to make baby bottles that was responsible for leaching BPA, and that was even in unheated liquids. I am surprised anyone is actually selling things made of polycarbonate, for use with HOT beverages! Caveat emptor, I guess!I would use this thing if I wanted to maximize my body burden of hormone-disrupting chemicals that will build up in my fat stores and stay with me for life."
1,It is breakable,I have gone through 4 Bonjour French Presses in the past 1 1/2 years. The plastic plunger ribs break every time.Don't buy it!
1,Piece of Plastic Junk,Not had this 2 weeks and the plastic seal retainer has broken rendering product useless. The container may be unbreakable but the innards certainly are not!
5,French Press Pot,We enjoy this pot. I would recommend this pot to anyone with kids who do the dishes since we had to get a new one as the caraf of our glass one was broken with in days and this one seems to be holding up well to kid pressure. Great way to have just one cup of coffee.
2,Press is ok,"Other parts of this press do break under heavy use. Not really unbreakable. The carafe is solid, the other parts weak to fair."
3,Mostly Unbreakable,"The carafe on the Bon Jour French Press is indeed unbreakable, However, the rim on the mostly plastic plunger BROKE within a week.. Thus my morning coffee sometimes has more grounds than the natuonal Arboretum."
2,Breakable french press,"When they say 'unbreakable', they are referring to the plastic caraffe, which is probably very durable, although I never dropped it. However, the construction of the plunger and filter is poor. It is almost entirely plastic. Mine broke after about two weeks. The first time I put it through the dishwasher the plunger broke within two days. I'm going to drive over the caraffe now and see if it's really unbreakable. Don't buy this press, get the sturdy glass bodum one and just be careful with the glass."
4,Great coffee if you use with care,"This press produces some of the smoothest, most flavorful coffee I've ever tasted... and I only use Kirkland (Costco) coffee in a can. The acrylic carafe has held up exceptionally well. However, the bottom plastic ring which holds the filter of the press in place broke in three pieces after about a month's worth of use. Granted, I probably pressed on the grounds a little too hard trying to get that last drop of great coffee. The good news is that the warrantee dept at 1-800-2bonjour quickly agreed to mail me a replacement part."
2,BonJour Unbreakable French Press Broke,"The inside plastic bottom press plunger part broke with the first 2 weeks of use. It simply broke into pieces. We used it 8 times or so before this happened.The glass outside container works great... But the inside lower black plastic on the plunger unsnapped and was cracked quickly making the pressnon-functional.I guess it is back to a traditional ""breakable"" french press for me!Unbreakable sounded too good to be true and it was!"
1,"Ours broke, and it didn't take long","Believe me, we handled the item carefully, because we treasure our morning coffee. It didn't take long before the carafe broke (no, we didn't drop it or bang it in the sink) and --- after we mended it with crazy glue --- it was only a couple of weeks afterwards that the plastic mounting for the filter/plunger feature disintegrated. So disappointing. And not a jot of sympathy from Customer Relations. Don't buy this. It's a piece of junk."
2,Not so unbreakable,"I've used this french press a handful of times and like so many other the plunger broke which makes the press unusable. You would think with the ""unbreakable"" marketing of this press you would think it would last more than just a few months of gentle use."
1,Broken Unbreakable,I too purchased this item due to the unbreakable claim on the box. Carafe is unbreakable; Filter assembly definitely breaks. Filter assembly broke after about a month's usage. Purchased product at Bed Bath and Beyond and they offered a flyer with a 1-800 number for culinary parts and said they would be unable to assist me any further. Tried the number and the Gourmet Depot Company representative informed me there were no replacement parts for this item. I have been retrieving the broken plastic parts from the sink after cleaning and carefully fitting them back together for use until I decide on a replacement. I definitely would not purchase this product again. I will also be more careful with my purchases at Bed Bath and Beyond due to this experience.
4,Unbreakable BUT * * *,"I have owned three versions of this brand's unbreakable French press over the years. I once owned another brand's glass models that were just too fragile.With each version of this press, I have gotten years of reliable, daily service. And yes, the carafe is unbreakable. HOWEVER, today, as with each prior one I have owned, the screen assembly in the press came apart -- the plastic pins were not all well glued and slowly the press pulled apart as I pulled the press out for cleaning after each use.I would say I got my money's worth out of each unit. And, I intend to buy another."
3,Another broken plunger,Unfortunately we are another household with a cracked plastic plunger after about 4 months of daily CAREFUL use...We'll give it another try in the hope the company has rectified this obvious problem.
4,Great for travellers,"I read here that quite a few people have had problems with the screens and/or the plunger part breaking. I haven't had that problem with mine at all, but I'm careful not to grind my coffee too fine and I press very carefully.Mine has held up very well packed in my suitcase (I travel constantly; it's part of my job), which surprised me, what as Northwest seems capable of destroying anything, eventually.My only beef is that the screen on the lid clogs up making it hard to pour the coffee out.I'd buy another one in a heartbeat."
1,HORRIBLE product,"Like others, I too had a problem with the screen housing - it cracked after only about 10 uses, and thus the whole thing became useless. I've treid to get ahold of Boujour/Meyer, but with no luck - they are either always closed, or you want forever to talk to someone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM!"
2,Lousy Filter Assembly - Plastic not metal like premier Bodum presses,"I bought this Bonjour press w/ polycarbonate carafe after breaking the glass carafe in my original Bodum Chambord model. In addition to the glass nature, I didn't care for the metal frame of the Chambord either.I do like the style & appearance of this Bonjour. Also, love the unbreakable carafe. HOWEVER, neither of those features matter much when you end up with many fines in your coffee cup due to the terrible plastic & rubber filter assembly design.I recently discovered the Bodum Brazil model, purchased it here on Amazon (during the ""3 for 1 Promotion"" & LOVE it. This model doesn't require removal of the carafe which results in a reduced risk of breakage. And, not only does it look even better than this Bonjour, the metal (not plastic)screen filter offers the PERFECT cup of coffee (especially when using Costa Rican coffee)!!"
2,"Carafe may be ""unbreakable"" but that is not the case with the filter!","I opted for the ""unbreakable"" coffee press for my office as the previous glass carafe did not fair well in an office environment. My high hopes were short lived as the plastic portion of the filter started cracking after a few months of very infrequent use and then broke into half a dozen little pieces in a little over a year. It appears the manufacturer placed their focus on creating the unbreakable carafe while neglecting filter quality all together. I am now left with a carafe- just a carafe."
1,"Ok product, poor construction","I was quite disappointed in this French Press. I had it for about 2 months before the press mechanism fell apart. I was using the press daily, but that is only to be expected.Other then sub-par construction and longevity it made pretty good coffee. Not sure how different one French Press is from another but we will see. Just not another Bonjour."
1,Filter screen broke after two months of very little use,"As others have written (in 2005!) - the plastic on the filter screen completely fell apart after a couple of dozen uses - always hand washed, never abused. The carafe might be unbreakable, but it's useless without the other, apparently HIGHLY BREAKABLE part.So, in 2009, the problem still hasn't been fixed.What a waste of money."
2,The strainer will outlast the pot,"The plastic strainer lowest part disintegrated around the nut holding it on and was unworkable after about six months. Since it had a tendency to periodically come apart and had to be put back together (not always easy), I might have overtightened it. I replaced it with a Bodum stainless steel strainer pot of the same size - literally as it turns out since the strainer fit the old pot too. Both pots are described as borosilicate but the Bonjour feels more like plastic to the touch than the Bodum. The Bodum costs $10 more evidently due to the use of a stainless strainer."
5,Makes great coffee,"This is my third BonJour Hugo French Coffee press -- I managed to break the first two, which were glass. (The first one broke in the dishwasher, and the second fell off the counter).I originally purchased this for camping (without electricity) but liked the coffee so well that I took it home for my primary coffee maker.The fact is this makes great coffee and hopefully I won't break this one.Update, March 2010Carafe has a two inch crack on the bottom. BonJour has offered to replace it, but I have to mail it back to them and wait. The coffee is so good I hate to part with it and the leak is a very tiny amount.I am probably going to buy another one, then mail this one back."
2,"Unbreakable, yet it broke!","So disappointed! I had a terrific glass french press for 9 years, until I accidentally hit it to hard against the waist basket to get the grounds out. I thought I'd be smart and buy this unbreakable one. The beaker itself is not glass, and thus unbreakable, but the plunger parts are made of plastic, unlike the stainless steel parts in my old one. To my surprise, after about 10 uses, the plastic cracked into several pieces for no apparent reason. Now I am shopping for another one, and will probably go back to glass, hoping that all the parts will be of decent quality."
3,Not as good as expected!,"Bought this item based on previous reviews and because I wanted an ""unbreakable"" french press. The problem I have with this unit is that it allows grounds to clog the pour filter very quickly making it necessary to remove the plunger unit and clear the filter before the coffee cup is filled. I don't know if I received a bad unit or if this is a problem with this model, but it definetly makes it a hassle when using it. It does make a good cup of strong coffee if you don't mind clearing the filter in the middle of your pour."
5,works great,"I bought this to carry back and forth to work. It works great and has a nice filter that keeps the grounds out. Also, it is not as fragile as my glass bodlum."
4,hugo press,"Its a great press although I must admit I dont use it much, I use the press mostly for Thai tea, not coffee. It does a decent job at straining the grains but it could be a bit better. The only complaint is that the lid is flimsy and loose. I assume it is loose to let air out."
4,Plenty of Teaching Potential In One Book,"Follow the bear family through their day in this introduction to several of the buildings found in a city (a school, a supermarket, an office, a library) and the different things that happen inside them. Labeled color illustrations depict what happens inside the buildings in a manner similar to the Richard Scary books. My son spent a lot of time poring over these pages looking at all the detail. A two page spread will show the building full of people doing the things people (and bears) do inside those buildings. The next two pages leave out the surroundings and just have pictures of the individual bears with the labels about what they are doing, these illustrations are just against white space. You could flip back and forth to find the matching pictures."
3,Not Necessarily the Best of Hitchcock,"Since childhood I have been a devoted Hitchcock fan. I've seen most of his films and feel that volume 1 of ""Best of Hitchcock"" doesn't actually represent the very best of the director's work.This volume contains three of Hitch's very best--""Rear Window"", ""Shadow of a Doubt"", and ""Psycho"". Two other films offered are excellent efforts; those are ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""Family Plot"". But ""Topaz"" and ""Rope"" are inferior films (albeit with some interesting content). They would be better replaced by the superb ""Strangers on a Train"", ""Notorious"", ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"", or ""North by Northwest""."
3,"Very funny to listen, but your girlfriend will look at you like saying ""you're disgusting""","If you like the sleazy glam-rock 80s era, then this is a good soundtrack of those days. Not something I will call the best musical creation, but it's funny to hear those lyrics, in Spanish we call it ""Machismo"" and you're girl will ask you to stop playing it... then you can turn it even louder... :)"
3,Good traditional glasses.,"These are good traditional beer glasses. The glass is NOT very thick, so be careful putting them in the dishwasher. Also the bottom of one of my glasses is rounded, so the glass doesn't sit square on the table. Oh well, just give me a Guinness!"
1,Problem from Unknown Ingredient,"I have had headaches and upset stomach from this product. I have stopped taking it twice and started again and the problems came back each time. I don't know which of the ingredients is causing my problem. If you haven't taken this before, I suggest you start with a small amount in case you have similar reactions."
5,Love this stuff.,"And, it comes in the perfect dosage for my 11 year old chocolate lab - 1 pill a day. It was recommended by her vet. She went from a creaky old lady to a puppified adult dog who totally enjoys her walks and runs and even runs up hills."
1,Sketchy navel gazing,"Nostalgia run rampant, without connective tissue or narrative propulsion, this is perhaps something that the author's kin might find worth perusing at some later date, but hardly more than that. I'd recommend something by one of the Wolff brothers if you want to see how it's truly done."
2,fails without warning,I would not recommend this product. It failed unexpectedly and left me without the data I needed. A portable drive should be rugged enough to travel and reliable enough to depend on. This company makes and inexpensive drive in a nice package but it is not rugged or reliable.
4,Maybe a little thin on the edges,"but I gulped it down nevertheless! As usual, the unstopable Marlen goes head first into something she really, really shouldn't have and finds herself, and her family, in a midst of a generations old feuds in a truly Wild West town, full of colourful characters.Expectedly, things quickly turn for the worse and (unexpectedly)Karps do not come out of this mess unscathed (no, I won't go into details - read the book).Maybe not the best in the series, but I am biting my nails for the next installment nevertheless."
2,"Lots of Karps, no meat","This time the book focuses solely on the antics of Marlene, Butch, Lucy and the twins, with the main plot being so anemic nobody really cares. However after all this time we are hooked on the Karps, so I personnaly will be back for more next year..."
2,Too ridiculous to be interesting,"I am an avid reader of Butch Karp & Marlene Ciampi series. However, the each one becomes more and more ridiculous. Absolute Rage was so ridiculous that is was unenjoyable reading. Also, the more I read Mr. Tanenbaum the more I am beginning to dislike him. I find his ridiculing of any place other than New York City very offensive. He constantly degrades anyone and their capabilities if they do not work in New York. This time West Virginia...a novel before Delaware. Get a grip Bob....there is a life outside of the Big Apple."
5,this is a good product,"I have been a fan of the safari toys for a long time, and this is a great addition to the collection. i got the bigger one for christmas, and had to get this one to go as a pair. he is highly detailed, constructed in very durable plastic, and the expression of the mammoth is very lively and playful. you will not be disappointed."
5,"Beautiful, instant classic!!","Very rarely do the words of a story and the illustrations come together as perfectly as they do in this book. The illustrations by Jeram are timeless masterpieces that would look beautiful framed on your wall. I'm convinced her work will be regarded as lovingly in the future as we regard Beatrix Potter today. The story is also wonderfully told. There are not many words to this story so it is perfect for the younger set. The story perfectly captures the bond between parent and child. The game that they play is sweet and any parent can relate to it. Throughout the story, parent and child find new, inventive ways to express their love for each other. It is the perfect book for any parent who often find themselves looking at their child searching for the perfect words to convey their love."
1,Not the same as in the picture!,My nieces each recently had a baby. We were asked to get books. I looked for one exactly like the one my son had because he enjoyed it very much. But what he enjoyed most was the bunny. I was elated to find this. When I received the books my excitement was turned immediately to sadness. I had seen others for sale like the one I received but they were not the same. The bunny you show in the picture is bigger then the one I received which is why the book looks smaller. This is nothing like what I was to believe I was ordering. I'm heartsick. This is what I did receive [...]
5,One of the best books written about caring for each other!!!,"When my wife bought me this book, I was touched that the authors could bring across such strong feelings with a few pictures and words. I enjoyed this so much I bought it for my Mother for Christmas!! She is a reading teacher and will surely enjoy sucha great book for children. Besides all that, the message from this book is just the ones we would want our children to understand and learn!!"
4,Above and beyond the call of duty,"Came on time. It said Used: Acceptable, but I'd swear it's new. The book is an old classic and I'm glad I got a deal at 7 bucks."
5,TSUBO Information,Just wanted to let you know that TSUBO has been reprinted in paperback form by Japan Publications.
2,not very reliable,"Mine died after 2 years of service (out of warranty). I also had one of their PC cards gradually fail and then stop working. It's a good product when it works, but not very reliable, in my experience."
4,Works great,I shoot about once a week and this stuff cleans up my guns better than anything else I have found for the money.
4,"Good product, bad smell","Hoppes is a good product for cleaning guns, but make sure to wear gloves and use in a well ventelated area. There may be other better products out there, but it has been around a long time and still does a pretty good job for the money."
4,Hoppe's No. 9 Gun Cleaning solvent,Hoppe's No 9 solvent is a good non-corrosive and one of the less toxic gun cleaning solvent. I like to use it before/after I've used copper removing solvents like Butches Bore Shine and Sweet's 7.62 copper solvent to neutralize and remove these corrosive solvents. Hoppe's a good time tested gun cleaning solvent that should be part of your gun cleaning process.
1,ZERO STARS if I could,"Ok, I have to admit that I did not read this book but the title of this book sets women back about 150 years and makes the romance genre look horrible (it doesn't need anymore help in that department, that's for sure).What's next ""Knocked Up By the Prince""?"
1,Crappy,"There are 4 mostly-static(as in ""not moving""), distant, poorly lit angles on the women, and unless you are really fascinated by ten minutes of the same boring exercise, its just not worth it. There are far better ways to spend money on DVDs of naked women. A good idea, but horribly low budget and unfulfilling."
2,A WORKOUT FOR ARM WRESTLERS AND BUTTER CHURNERS ONLY,"As much as I hate to admit it, I am now at an age where I really should exercise and watch what I eat. However, for me, this video did very little to aid either aspiration.After loading this DVD I promptly dropped the BVDs; you know, to honor the well intended spirit of the workout program. But unfortunately, after intently following the workout in its entirety, I can say that only my right arm was exhausted and feeling the burn. And for some reason I was absolutely jonesin' for some fish tacos?Oh well, at least I gave it the old ""college"" try, and I suppose all is not lost, as I did drop a few ounces (albeit fluid ounces), and two appendages did receive a pretty brutal workout. Therefore, two stars out of five. If I were ambidextrous, three stars would have been given. I am insufficiently jointed and imaginative to even ponder a five star rating."
1,Proper Rubbish,"I would have given this 0 stars but you can't. What a waste of money, I was lookin forward to knockin one off as well."
3,"Fun to see, fun to exercise","I like watching the ladies do all the jumping jacks, etc. The tough part is, I know I should stand up and join them to get my 20 minutes of exercise each day. Got to beat this lazyness. The instructor is very good. The women seem to enjoy the class without the burden of clothes. Glad I bought it."
3,Low production values but real girls,"Four women are filmed doing aerobics in a very cramped motel room. Only three are totally naked and they keep bumping into each other and the wall as they follow totally clothed instructor while trying to ensure they each get some camera time.The nude women are all attractive natural girls. My favorite bit is in the beginning when the instructor is giving dietary advice while warning against tobacco use. Two of the nude girls are in this bit doing the old Carol Merril pointing to carrots and cigarettes.Overall, it is what it is and it probably worth owning if you like to collect nudie movies. There's also another feature about campus girls that gets a little artsy for my taste but your girlfriend might approve."
3,Get past the hope of erotica or exercise and laugh,"I purchased this video because a friend and I really wanted to start working out and we are very *sexual* girls. I must be honest, the video in no way must be taken seriously. I mean, you CAN do the exercises and you WILL break a sweat (so it does have some value) - but the actual quality is poor. I wound up showing the video on my bigscreen during a party, and it was a big hit. We laughed til we cried watching the out of sync girls (...) and the fully clothed instructor. There is one girl in particular in the center (you will know exactly who I mean if you watch it) who is so hysterical as she is almost always out of step, kicks the instructor, and backs into the fireplace. So, if your goal is exercise, it's doable. If it's erotica, forget it. If it's for entertainment, you will laugh 'til you cry. (...)it's great for parties."
3,ok,But! the camera color is annoying. they are 2-3 cameras and the color don't match so very cheaply done. decent looking ladys
2,Sucks,"Bad camera work Bad quality Girls Don't look anything like the cover, and crapy workout to boot"
4,Just what I needed,"It takes a lot to get me standing in front of the tv, jumping around like an idiot, to tighten up my pudgy belly. Richard Simonds, Denise Austin, forget it. So how did this program pry me off the recliner? The arobics ladies are buck naked. That's good enough for me. When they say stretch down, I do it. When they say reach for the sky, my arms jump. If Nude Cardiovascular Workout is what it takes to lower my blood preasure, cholesterol, weight, stress, etc, then I gladly submit. A few minutes, five days a week here in my living room with my new instructors. If this exercise class of nude ladies can't raise my heart rate, I don't know what else possably could. 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4."
1,Yuch,"Actually, the exercises are good. The camera work, lighting and such leaves much to be desired. The exercises were tough. I preferred the exercises in the ""Totally Nude Aerobics"" video over the ones in this one.They were less strenuous, although I still had to work up to some of them.As for the other feature, there was one realy cute chick. the rest were okalthough there was one who I swear was closer to Social Security than shewas to college. This one is better left on the shelf. Charlie S."
5,"If You Lived Here, I'd Know Your Name",This was the most delightful book. I often find myself pondering many of the same thoughts the Author expressed. It's nice to have someone put the thoughts to words.
4,Great story,"As the other reviews mention, there's a lot of talk of death, so if you can find the celebration of life that the author intends, you'll enjoy this book. I found myself looking forward to getting back to it throughout the day - always a good sign. Lots of colorful characters and interesting description of life in Hanes."
5,Great Book and Interesting Read,"It took me a while to get into the book, but after a few chapters i had a hard time putting down the book. This was a great read with great perspective into life and death, rural living in Alaska and the true meaning and importance of family and friends. I would definitely recommend it and would love to read more from this author!"
4,"If you Lived Here, I'd Know Your Name: News fro Small-Town Alaska",I have read this book twice now. It made me want to visit this small town and say Hi to the author.
3,I really wanted to like this,"I started out really liking this book. It's my favorite genre - I love a memoir. Unfortunately, the author's personality kept getting in the way. I felt it became more and more self promoting as she smugly casts herself as the most tolerant person in the town - she's almost doing her neighbors a favor when she accepts them as they are and *gasp* realizes she could actually like a conservative! What a novel idea! It just really started to bug me, and I'm sorry because I loved reading about small town Alaska."
4,Charming and heartfelt,"This was an enjoyable read. The author, Heather Lende, brings to life many interesting characters of Haines, Alaska. I found the book thoughtful and heartfelt, and it evoked many emotions - from laughter to tears. I'm looking forward to reading her next book, and highly recommend this one."
2,Too much like reading a blog,"I like books about small town folks like ""Driftless"" but this was written too much like a blog. She even changes person narration from ""I"" to ""you"" which lead me to think the short chapters were just slapped together with little editing. I did like her care and kindness to the diversity of opinion in her community and her life sounds very pleasant. Just wish the story was better written."
2,Depressing,"This book promised to be entertaining and was, somewhat. However, I found it depressing that she had to grope for platitudes and sentimental stories to find a meaning for life and death. IMHO, she missed out on the comfort of faith in Christ who lived a perfect life in our place, and died to give us heaven without us having to earn it by being ""good"" people. It ended up in my recycling bin."
2,"If You Died There, She'd Write About You","Though I enjoyed reading about Haines and parts of this author's life, the preoccupation with death throughout this book was overwhelming. Death of relatives, strangers, friends, animals. Accidental death. Death by falling, by weather, by cancer, by boats sinking, by airplanes crashing. Fear of death. Near death. Funerals. Researching and writing obituaries. Anniversaries of loved ones dying. Even when it seems a chapter is going to be about a different subject, within a few pages it seems like death always sneaks in there.I'd like to see another book by this author, this time devoted to life and living, instead of death and dying."
4,Quality,"I found that this camera bag was exactly what I wanted. It wasn't big and bulky or heavy on its own, but it had space for my camera and accessories. I liked the bag because it had several different zip-up pockets for things like batteries and whatnot. The bag is also padded very well, and the top not only zips it has a flap that snaps over it. If I were to be walking around in the rain I wouldn't worry that my camera was protected if it was in that bag. I feel the description given was accurate and I am pleased with my product."
4,"Good Quality, Small DSLR Camera Bag - Recommended","The ""Tamrac Explorer 10 DSLR"" camera bag is well made, sturdy, and fairly compact. It works very well with my Pentax K100D (a very small DSLR), the 50-200mm telephoto lens (a fairly compact lens) and a few small accessories. NOT much else will fit in the bag, which is fine since I have larger camera bags if I need to haul around all of my equipment.This bag is perfect if you know what you will need in the field and want it in a compact, easy to carry form.Recommended with the size caveat expressed above!"
3,"Solid construction, but too small","This bag is very well built, nice compartments and a tight closing mechanism. The only reason is it got 3 stars and not 5 is because it's size is deceiving. I have a canon powershot s3 is and a very small battery charger. They barely fit inside there. I have to put the AC cord for the charger under the camera. I was hoping for something a little bigger. The compartments are very small, but it is a good bag for someone who doesn't plan on having any spare lenses or storing anything else in there besides camera stuff."
4,Solid entertainment,"This book is well worth getting *just* for the story ""Lost in Translation"", which I've read several times already. The rest of the stories are frosting on the cake."
4,greedy,"If you're with that person, love them where they areand, try to help them move forward. When you're greedyyou will loose everytime."
5,All that I expected,I purchased this as a Christmas present for my daughter. She moved her oboe right in and had no issues. She has yet to add the longer strap...will see how that goes. Would recommend.
1,Fox Oboe will not fit this case.,I purchased the oboe case from Music 123. After submitting the order I was notified it was back ordered. 3 weeks later it arrived. The compartments in the case are too small for the intermdiate level Fox oboe. They are not even close. Returning the case to Music 123 proved difficult due their poor customer service - 3 phone calls to process the return - 40 minutes wait time.
3,Super Heavy Tarp Review,"I bought tarp to cover my SPA for winter and summer back in November, 2010. The tarp started to weaken in middle and it was tearing up in pieces. It was very disappointing that it did not even last a year. The tarp seem thick enough; I am not sure how to make the longevity longer. I am not sure if it's worth the price."
2,"Great coffee, but mine didn't last","This makes great coffee. However, after less than 6 months of less than once per day use the plastic screen holder on the bottom of the plunger is falling apart."
3,"Not the best, great them gentle","This isn't a heavy duty press, but it's decent for the single coffee drinker. Makes 3 cups, but I only make two cups at a time."
2,Sort of unbreakable,I thought the price was right and wanted a coffee maker for camping and sailing that wasn't glass (no breakage) but my experience is much like the others. After a few uses the plunger bottom cracked and broke. I've been searching for a replacement plunger without much luck.
2,"Unbreakable, my behind!",The outside is unbreakable but not the plunger. I never dropped it or put it in the dishwasher. This thing didn't even last a year. I went to wash it the other day and the plastic around the screen just fell apart into a bunch of pieces. Who cares if the outside works if your coffee is full of grounds?
1,Unbreakable? Hah!,"Bonjour's claims of indestructability are true, in part: the hard plastic carafe of this French press won't shatter no matter how many times you drop it on the floor. But after a year of regular use the plunger, which holds a fine metal screen in place with a pair of plastic braces, fell to pieces. And, wouldn't you know it, you just can't buy a replacement. At least when you smash a glass carafe you can pick up a new one. This thing makes good coffee, but you'll have to buy a new one before long."
2,Screen Holder Broke,"I've used french presses for years and always managed to break the glass pots so I thought I'd try this one. Well, the pot may be ""unbreakable"", but the plastic gasket surrounding the screen broke after about 10 uses. Cool idea, bad design."
2,Unbreakable ?? Unless you use it,"Bought for my husband. Loved the size, convenience UNTIL the plastic piece at end of plunger broke into minute pieces. What if he wasn't paying attention and drank all that in his very strong coffee? Lasted about 1 month, not everyday use. What good is an unbreakable container if the guts break apart? Only good now for our granddaughter to play tea party with sans the inner pieces. Would NEVER suggest, recommend or buy another product from this manufacturer. If only I could find all the original paperwork, back it would go..."
1,Unbreakable my a**.,"We have had this french press for a few months. We are a single couple and used it nearly every morning. No heavy use, just one pot per day. We loved it at first (it does work well when not broken). We have always been gentle with it. My husband was making coffee this weekend and two of the plastic support pieces on the bottom of the plunger broke off. It is now unusable. No, I didn't save the box so I can not send it back because well.....IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNBREAKABLE. I love coffee from a french press, but I think I'll get a percolator. VERY disappointed. I'm not even sure where to quality products anymore......"
1,It broke in less than a month...,"I've had this thing for three weeks, and the radial struts of the lower filter retainer, at the lower end of the piston, broke. I'm not particularly heavy-handed, and I don't think I was being careless."
2,"would be nice, but filter breaks","The plastic filter holder on my press broke after only a few weeks. It must be very fragile, it was simply sitting in the dish drainer when I noticed it was broken in several places. I have a metal one I've had for years that has never broken. Other than that, I liked the second filter on the spout and thought it was a nice feeling press, all round."
3,"A great french press, though not for everyday use...","This is a great little french press, perfect for one person unless you don't mind making multiple batches. It is better suited for occasional use, or perfect for camping trips. I used to use mine everyday, but as with the other reviewers observations, had to toss it out after the plastic bit over the mesh screen broke. So if you are looking for a durable everyday coffeemaker, this probably isn't the best choice."
3,small but gets the job done,"It's a little on the small side, however, it's good for a mug of coffee in the mornings which is all I need."
1,false advertising,3 cups only if you're a child having a tea party. i called and complained when i received this item but received no satisfaction. the cups they advertise are european style and even though this is made to be sold in america the company is so elitist that they don't mention the ounces per cup and refuse to even consider that they are fooling the public.
2,Not Microwaveable,Product was fine except that it isn't microwaveable. At the time of purchase it claimed to be microwaveable. The handle has a screw in it. I purchased it specifically for use in a microwave.
1,Does not deserve 1 star!,The filter part of this french press is poorly designed. It broke after less than 2 weeks worth of use. Not worth your money!
2,Be sure to check the size!,"While the product does what it is supposed to do....making French Press coffee...it does not make very much. The three cup size is deceiving. It barely makes enough for a smaller than average coffee mug. If you love coffee as much as I do and want to make more at one sitting, go for the 8-cup French Press...it gives you more options about how much you want to make. I sent back the 3 cup, ordered the BonJour 8 cup French Press, and was very satisfied with its performance!"
2,3 cups? Not even close.,"I'm not sure what constitutes 3 cups, but even if you use the 6 ounce cup common(not sure why) with coffee makers that adds up to 18 ounces. If you fill this coffee press to absolute capacity without coffee grounds it only holds 12 ounces. That's only 2 cups using the 6 ounce cup standard.Other than that, it works fine."
1,Is it really a 3-cup?,"I ordered this item thinking that it was really a 3-cup French press... but when I opened the box, it seemed more of a 3-cup espresso. Too bad it was that small."
2,Strong but tiny.,"Finally a carafe I can't break in the morning before i drink out of it... However, the 3 cup volume isn't 3 cups of the type you drink coffee out of, rather the cups you measure in.Therefore, I ended up returning it for their unbreakable 8-cup model. If I only needed 3 cups after a night on the town, I wouldn't have needed unbreakable..."
2,Too Small,I has no idea that this was so small. I thought 3 cups would be at least 30 ounces. It's not even 12.
3,Small,"Much like everyone else has said this does not look like three cups. Actually, if you hold on one second I will test this out; Okay, I filled a measuring cup with 2 cups of water, and to full capacity this thing didn't even hold the full two cups.Now, this is an outrage to me. Because a) it doesn't even fill two cups when it boasts that it will hold 3 and b) even if with the almost-two cups it can hold, it certainly won't make two cups of coffee in one shot. If you subtract the space occupied by the grounds, and the press element of the coffee press, it'll probably make one whole cup of coffee. Rip-off man.The only thing I liked was that it came with a nice little spoon to measure out the grounds. Yea I liked that, almost enough to forget about the whole discrepancy with the 1-cup it makes to the 3-cups it claims. NOT. I think I plan on calling the company to give them a piece of my mind!"
1,Broke under light use,"Broke under light use. One of the worst products ever. Not worth a single cent.I used it very carefully, but it broke anyway."
2,Coffee Press,"Unbreakable carafe possibly, but the strainer mechanism deteriorated in two weeks. The plastic carafe is smaller then the glass replacement so it won't fit old units. Luckily I was able to mate up my old strainer parts to the plunger and it will work until..."
2,I am verry UNHAPPY with BonJon Hugo French Press,BonJour Hugo 3 cup Frencess was not even two cups moor like ONE and a HALF.Sorry no good reviews from Me
2,"Unbreakable, unless you intend to make coffee.","I won't start by complaining about the size, it does say twelve ounces.It also says ""Microwavable when lid and metal parts removed.""So I used this to boil water in the microwave and the bottom cracked after four uses.Other than that, great press."
2,Huge piece of crap,"This french press worked fine for about a year (hence the two stars as opposed to one)...and then it literally just fell apart in several places, all at once. It was cheap in price and quality."
3,a bit small,"The press is a bit smaller than i expected, truly a one cup (not mug) coffee press. It does work well, it's sturdy, and exactly as pictured."
3,Not very good,"The material this is made of is not nearly as good as glass. It discolors when washed, so who knows what leaches into the coffee when it is made?"
1,not very long term,"I have a large press, but want to make only coffee for one, so I got this one. Was good for couple of weeks, then the rubber inside got loose, so I glue it together, but got loose again.Now Im making coffee thru sifter. So as far as recomendation, no I would not recomend it to anyone."
2,"Lasted a while, then fell apart on me","I bought this because it was the cheapest French Press at Bed Bath and Beyond, in hindsight, I should have just bought a nicer one. After about a month of using it fairly regularly the container got foggy and scratched from use, and I hand wash it very carefully. After about four months of regular use I noticed that the plastic screen holder was cracked, and then a few days later it crumbled into about 20 pieces. I liked the rubber holder for the base, which made me certain it was not going to slip off of anything or overheat my countertops, and I also liked the lid with both a screen and a closed portion to keep the heat in. I bought a new all metal and glass press, I am over using plastic, which can be bad for you over long periods of time."
1,Unsatisfied,"Last I checked, we live in America, not France. Three cups means three eight-ounce cups. Not three four-ounce cups, not one and a half cups (this is how much it actually holds). The headline should clearly read ""three FOUR-OUNCE cups"", otherwise it's misleading. Really, this makes a single mug of coffee. Had I known this, I would not have payed money for what seemed like a normal-sized French press, but what is actually a gag-gift sized miniature of the real thing. You couldn't wake up a chihuahua with that much coffee."
1,Poorly Built,This item was great at first but after just a few weeks of use the circular filter press fell apart. VERY disappointing and now I have to buy a new one!
2,Poor filter mechanism leaves floaties,"The filter seals against the wall with an o-ring. This is not enough to prevent what you are filtering (in my case, tea) from getting past the filter and thus leaving floaties."
1,Bonjour tiny French press,"First, when they say three cups they mean three doll tea-party sized cups. Also, the plunger holding the screen broke almost immediately on this stink burger. Avoid at all costs."
1,Don't buy this!,"I feel like an idiot for buying this thing. It's made entirely out of plastic (??) which we all know is not a suitable container for HOT water! Perhaps this does render the carafe ""unbreakable"" but I would gladly take a breakable carafe over one that leaks toxic BPAs into my coffee every time I use it! In addition, within 5 cups of coffee the (plastic??) filter holder began to chip and by now it is broken entirely and completely unusable. I looked online to see about getting a new one and guess what? Hundreds of people are complaining about the filer breaking in exactly the same way. So now I'm an idiot for not reading ANY reviews before buying. You don't have to be!(Can I also mention how ridiculous it is for something that holds 8oz to be called a ""3 cup"" coffee maker??--but again, this just makes me a bad consumer for not reading the fine print)"
2,Inside is breakable!,I really wanted to like this press. It's got a nice tough decanter and a really helpfull rubber base but the strainer broke after just a few months. Now it's going to a landfill. Too bad.
2,NOT three cups.,"I have a french press that I love, but it is only good for one cup. I was excited to find one that can make three, as I'd only need to make coffee once in the morning. When it arrived, it was EXACTLY the same size as the one I already have. One coffee cup's worth of coffee, not three. Not even close. There isn't anything physically wrong with the item, it just isn't what was advertised. I decided to keep it anyway and use it in the holiday gift swap, but I won't be using it."
2,it broke...,"Calling your product ""unbreakable"" is just asking for trouble... Having dropped and shattered a glass french press before, I thought I'd give it a try. Well, I enjoyed this for about a month, until it broke. The plunger rolled off the counter, onto CARPET, and broke. The plastic spines on it snapped, the rubber gasket popped off, it's done. Unbreakable? I think not. You might be hard pressed to break the plastic carafe, but the plunger mechanism is another story..."
1,Filter screen unbreakable-NOT,"Bought my Bonjour Hugo about 3 months ago and the first thing I noticed was the dinky filter assembly. I was careful to press slowly, not use to much force and never disassembled it. That did not help. First a quarter of the retaining fell off so I epoxied it in place. Then the retaining tabs started breaking off. You can find replacement cups anywhere. You can't find replacement filter assemblies.Maybe I can use the cup as a beaker in the shop."
2,It worked great ..... until it broke.,I've use it for less than a year. the press part of the french press broke. there is no way to replace it.too bad.
3,Tiny,"I know, I know, people keep saying read the amount it holds and don't complain about its size, but I am, it holds about 1 1/2 cups of tea at best. Otherwise it seems to work well and it is a good price."
3,Switch to Aeropress,"I used the BonJour 3 cup Unbreakable French Press for about a semester. Then, I forgot to clean out the coffee grounds and left them in the mesh for about a week. I tried to clean out the moldy mess that was left, but it was incredibly difficult to get everything out of the mesh.Then, I bought an Aeropress. It's easy to use, easy to clean and makes a better cup of coffee. You should buy that instead. No, really."
3,3 Cup??,"Not sure what measurement system, maybe another planet, but 3 cups? This thing doesn't even do 2/3 of my coffee cup. So have to make about two to four brews with this to get 1 to 2 cups of actual amounts. Other than that I seem to feel it's a good price, of course that's why I bought this lower cost one. Had I known it didn't even do one full cup I would have purchased something that at least did that - although not sure what size they would call it, maybe 5 cup?"
1,"Breakable ""unbreakable"" French Press","While the pot seems to be unbreakable, the plunger is not. I travel a lot and love my morning coffee. But I've gone through three of these pots (one I gave to a friend, so two for me, one for them) because the plunger falls apart after a short while. I wrote to the company for a replacement part (it's a simple plastic piece) but got no response. Don't purchase this allegedly unbreakable pot."
2,Oh so BREAKABLE,You can see it's cheap junk when you open the package. The cheap plunger just fell apart after a few months of occasional use. Very disappointed. The Bonjour website and customer service is similar to their craftsmanship.Not recommended.
1,One Cup,"I prefer coffee made in a French Press. My fovorite size is 16 oz (4 cup), but nobody seems to make one these days. Anyway, the pot does exactly what it is supposed to do. Most peoples' disappointments likely result from 3 cup expectations from a 12 oz pot. It's just a little guy. Edit note. Not recommended, plastic basket fell apart soon after original review. Also, BPA in plastic might be a health concren for some."
4,Great little press,"We got this press for travel and it is perfect. The size fits wonderfully in our suitcase or grocery chest and it operates exactly as a french press should. You have to know how to operate this to get it to make coffee, and that means drinking the coffee strong as is or adding hot water after you press it to make it more American style. We later purchased the larger size of press as well for times that we want more coffee without having to make two pots."
2,Plastic screen holder can break,"I got this little French Press for Christmas (cost was the full $25) and used it every day for five months, until the plastic screen holder on the bottom of the plunger pretty much disintigrated. I've used french presses for years and am in the habit of disassembling the plunger/filter mechanism for periodic cleaning. This is fine for metal screen holders, but this plastic one cracked and soon broke into small pieces.I'm going back to Bodum. Their glass carafes can break (and be replaced), but I never really liked the plastic carafe on the BonJour Hugo -- it quickly began showing minute scratches, giving the impression that it wasn't completely clean. (I'm not a clean freak, but good coffee calls for clean brewing equipment.)If it weren't for the broken holder and the plastic carafe, I would have given this french press five stars."
1,Stupid Product,"I bought this back in 2007 and was initially happy with it. Turns out ""unbreakable"" only refers to the cup, not the rest of the press.After a month or so the plunger screen broke in half.Lots of other people must think the same thing, because among the tag suggestions Amazon is giving me are ""horrible"" and ""junk"". Just be warned. You get what you pay for, and sometimes less."
2,Smaller than advertised,"I knew that this was going to be a small press, but I thought I could trust the description that claims it makes 12oz of coffee. This is not true. If you put the plunger and a few tablespoons of grounds in the pitcher, you'd be lucky to get 8oz of coffee. I returned it and will be buying a larger one. That said, the construction seemed good although the lid spins too easily between open and closed."
5,Pretyy darn Cool,I'm in the Army and Army coffee is lousy. Bought this thing for the field last month and it was well worth it. We aren't easy with our gear and this french press made it for a month in the field. I would recommend the next size up because this is a French thing and the three cups they use are TINY. Made enough for one American 12 oz cup. You know we supersize everything...anyway. five stars. It's worth it.
3,3 leprechaun cups,"Nice design. Rubber non-slip bottom. Mesh built into lid for further filtration. However, capacity is more like 12 oz. Unless you like three 4 oz. cups of coffee, I wish I ordered the 8 cup model."
2,Bonjour 3-cup unbreakable French Press,"First, this pot was advertised as 3-cup- it holds 10 oz without spilling, which may be the definition of a demitasse cup but certainly was not what I expected. Second, the filter on the bottom came apart within three weeks of use! I have sent it back to Bon Jour and they will replace it, but it's not what I wanted. I have since bought a larger unbreakable one for the same price on another website and will use my filter from my old large Bonjour which broke. So, problem solved, but money and time wasted!"
4,"Good quality, worth the money","Very good quality, perfect for personal use, although it's smaller than it shows in the picture."
1,Plastic disintegrated,The plastic holding the mesh on the plunger disintegrated like a lot of other people's here.It seems as though the plastic got brittle from the hot water over time.Glass and steel only for my next one.
1,Wow this thing Blows,FIrst off it does not make three cups of coffee and yes it says unbreakable but after four or five uses and being very careful with it the plastic ring around the filter began to crack and fall off and then completely fell apart leaving the thing useless do not buy this item
3,BREWTAKULAR,Great compact french press. Love that it is unbreakable since I have broke 2 glass presses. I wish it could make more coffee at once.
1,I had this press for 9 weeks and then it broke--not made well!,"This press was a great set-up for traveling but for just only 9 weeks of use it broke, the filter connector to the plunger broke-off rendering the press unusable!"
3,It broke.,Wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased. Mine broke 30 or so days in the exact same spot everyone else's did.
1,Broke in 1 week,"Bought this after the glass on our previous press broke. We had it for 8 years. Given the glass breaking on our previous press, we thought this would be great. It was great for the first week (I had even dropped the dispenser part once in that time - didn't break), but then like other reviews mentioned, the screen ""press"" holder plastic basically disintigrated. This obviously made the product unusable. Will go back to the other brand which is more expenseive, but if it lasts another 8 years as the previous one did, worth every penny."
2,BonJour 3-cup French Press,"I like the fact that it is not glass and we can take it on the road. I thought 3 cups would be ideal, however,it must be referring to a 3oz cup because it only makes enough for one 8-10 oz cup. Perhaps it should be classified as a 1 serving press."
3,over rated capacity,"Although this coffee press works ok, it is woefully short of ""3 cup"" capacity! It barely makes one decent size cup."
1,Teeny Tiny - Update: interior breaks easily,"I realize that three cups usually refers to the tiny coffee cups, but the liquid content of this french press would fill maybe two of those. Makes one decent mug of coffee, which is fine but a bit wasteful (have to use a bit more ground coffee to make two mugs than I would with a larger french press). Nothing special, but I would go with a five or eight cup if you are making coffee for more than just yourself.EDIT: I have used this item only on the weekends since purchase, have only hand washed and I never, ever touch the screen. I wash that by running hot water over it and shaking it, that's it. IT BROKE. The plastic on the top of the screen cracked, letting a rubber o-ring loose and releasing all of the grounds. Waste of money, if it can't take the light use and handling I was giving it then it is useless."
2,size matters,"its too small, even for a small-sized french pressthe mesh naturally starts to sink into the coffee before you even want to pressi wouldn't recommend the little presses"
2,I loved it - til it broke,"Well, I bought it, and originally gave it a 4 star review. But I've had it less than 5 months, gently used, and like many others - the screen broke.I really like the design of this, and the fact that it is only good for one (not 3) normal coffee mug is perfect for me.But to market an item as unbreakable, when obviously at least one part of this item is very breakable - just read the reviews. That's just not true.The price is very low, considering, and if I got a year's use out of it, I wouldn't really complain - I'd just buy another. But less than 5 months, using not quite once per day? Sorry."
1,Don't... just don't...,this show is a disgrace to gundam on the level of SD Gundam (not quite that bad =P). Just buy gundam seed (much better than gundam wing)
2,it dosnt deserve the title gundam,"I do not recomend this dvd at all the only reson i gave it 1 more extra star is because it has the name gundam on it. Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the best anime ever made, hands down. This anime has slightly spoiled its good name. Dont waste your money just buy Gundam Wing and Gundam Wing Endless Waltz."
4,"crunchy, sweet, and gluten free!","I started buying Can Do Kid bars a few years ago for the purpose of having a ready protein source for my kids when we are on the go. These vanilla bars are not quite as tasty as the chocolate, but they are a nice treat nonetheless. I have been eating gluten free for half a year now, and have found that most of the protein bars I used to favor for myself are now out of bounds. It was a pleasant surprise to find that the Can Do vanilla are GF. They are a simple cookie bar with vanilla coating. Each individually packed bar has two small portions inside, so you can share with a friend or save one piece for later!"
2,Recieved this item damaged...,"It's hard for me to decide how to rate this product. Since I have had this flavor before, I know that they are tasty and my 10 yr old loves them. However, the chocolate bars were discolored as though they had melted at some point in a warehouse or while being delivered. I had open several of the bars and all were damaged. Thankfully Amazon.com has made it easy to refund my money, and I am a happy camper. I had ordered a box of the Cookies & Cream and they were not damaged. Just thought I would give others the heads up..."
1,Don't Know Yet,"I would really love to tell you how I like the product that I ordered for my wife, back on 8/10/09, but you see, I still haven't received it yet and this is 9/10/09... 1 month later. I have e-mailed the seller inquiring as to when I might expect to receive them, buit as of yet have not heard back... Very unhappy with seller....."
4,"Scholarly, solid information, non-technical read","This encyclopedia offers a whole lot more than just entries on the thirty plus different organisms that cause sexually transmitted diseases. The entries include not only information on the diseases but also treatment modalities, various statistics, risk factors, prevention, support organizations, and historical information. Some of the entries provide fascinating historical information and statistical relationships between the diseases and race, socio-economic level, and gender. The authors even go so far as to include competing theories about treatment, origins of the disease, etc. Even-handed and complete the Encyclopedia of Sexually Transmitted Disease is a solid survey of the current understanding of sexually transmitted diseases."
1,Nowhere to hide?,"I am writing this on behalf of Sandy Cheeks and Dusty Bottoms... my two fuzzy trouble makers.What good is a hammock if there is nowhere to hide? Ferrets like to burrow and crawl through tunnels and holes because it is more like how their ancestors lived in the wild (and is still there natural instinct). Sandy and dusty love the hammocks that are covered and have a small circular entrance. If your going to buy your little fuzzy a hammock, buy them one they will love as much as you love them."
1,LOUNGE HAMMOCK,I DO NOT LIKE THE PLASTIC CLIPS(RATHER THAN THE METAL ONES)-I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS FLEECE-IT WASN'T VERY THICK AT ALL AND SHOULD'VE HAD A COVER (LIKE A SLEEPING BAG)-OVER IT-AS MY FERRET IS OLD AND FALLS OUT SOMETIMES. I'M RETURNING IT AS ONE OF THE CLIPS WAS BROKE WHEN I RECEIVED IT. LISA
2,"Author is knowledgable, but lacks esoteric understanding","While Ramotti has stated that the Nostradamus quatrains contain a code that reveals information beneath the surface, he does little in the way of making the reader understand what he has deciphered, and even less in making the reader understand his methodology. Much of it makes so little sense that it is amazing he printed it. He also does the decoding in Italian, which I feel should be in French. He implies by doing so that Nostradamus targeted an Italian audience for the quatrains. In reading the decoded verses, it appears that he groped to put together many of the sentences, making them sound almost incoherent. Insummary, I would say that he is indeed onto something with his decoding scheme, but he sorely lacks a deeply conscious, esoteric understanding of what is hidden beneath the quatrains, as well as the intepretation of the platelets (which contain many symbols of the tarot)."
3,Used as an advertisement for other works,"This was a good beginning to the study, but only covered about 1/3, in my estimation, of the information hinted at in its description. It seemed more of an advertisement to purchase the Authors other works. A good text, but lacking."
1,False Manuscript?,"I have communicated with a World-Known authority on Nostradamus, and he has told me that no such 'lost manuscript' of Nostradamus exists. Therefore, I must conclude that this book is not worth the paper it is printed on."
5,Awesome underwear,I had heard from friends that the CK modal trunks were extremely soft and comfortable so I decided to try them and I'm hooked. This is definitely my go to pair now.
5,Easily the best underware I've ever put on,These are the most comfortable things ever! Fit is perfect. Wash in cold and hang dry / fluff on low.
3,Not bad,"Soft and silky feeling, but for the price...I would opt for something else. Support isnt really there, but very comfy!"
4,Very Comfortable,"These are so comfortable and great. However now that I have washed them about 5 or 6 times and the fabric is starting to ""pill"". I thought I washed them following directions. still great but not sure about the recent price increase."
4,Very soft but a little short,I bought these along with another brand on here to test them out. These are very soft and comfortable but I found that they were shorter than I originally thought. They are closer to briefs than boxer briefs I think. There is also no fly so just FYI for you guys. All in all I like them but not as much as I like the other pair I got on here that were rated the top on amazon for boxer briefs.
2,terrible product,"I must admit. I have been trying several new products outthere due to the fact that my groins always hurt from the underwear. I bought this item due to the good reviews it had. But I was very disapointed. Even though it has a very soft cotton product, the item does not give room to your crotch area. This makes it very unconfortable especially when you sit down. The reason to this is the very tight front snd very low lower back cusion. due to the lower back being very low, it pushes on your groin area when you sit down. Very unconfortable. I bought the UNDER ARMOUR underwear, which are cheaper and are way better product. Calvin Klein are sorry!!!!"
1,"Poorly constructed, bad fit","I ordered 4 of these due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The only positive thing I've found about these is that they do flatter the figure (so to speak). Beyond that, they have been a complete disappointment. One pair literally started falling apart after the first hour of wearing it. The others are falling apart at a somewhat slower rate. But after two washes, it's clear they won't survive much longer. These underwear fit well at first when you put them on, but quickly stretch out causing them to ride up. It's just really poor design and construction. Of course it's taken me 40 days to figure all this out and now I cannot return them. That's a bitter pill to swallow.FWIW, I own about 20 pairs of the CK button-up boxer briefs and they are awesome. Great fit and construction. I never should have strayed."
4,Good quality,"it looks nice and have good quality. The only thing is after I bought it, I realized it is actually not cheap compared to some stores such as nordstrom rack"
3,Comfortable but not that supportive,The fabric is soft and comfortable but very stretchy. It is not as supportive as older versions I have had with other fabrics which I found better for sports.I liked the older versions and the under armor version better.
3,"Great fit & feel, low durability","When I first put these on I loved them. They fit great and I (& my wife) liked the way they looked and felt.However, after just one wear and one washing, according to the tag instructions, the stitching has come loose on one of the seams and there is a hole. I was very disappointed, as even the cheapest underwear shouldn't fall apart after one washing. These were far from cheap."
2,Eh,"I ordered these after reading all the online reviews, thinking they'd be airy, great on a hot humid summer day.They are fine as underwear, a bit thin in the fabric for my taste, but they don't seem exceptional to me, or worth the cost.I didn't think they were exceptionally comfortable or provided support better than anything else.I'll stick to plain cotton boxer briefs from the GAP."
1,never received order,I never received order told to reorder went back on line no longer at the price now double not happy!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Pretty ok,"These are pretty nice, feel good and smooth. A little short on the leg. Haven't worn to work because I think they might bunch up in the crotch... But ok for around the house!"
4,perfect cut,"Very nice fabric, light to wear, perfect cut. The only negative point is the price. They are not cheap but worthwile."
2,Not as comfortable as the ExOfficio,"I'm 5'6"" 145 lbs medium build and I bought a pair of small CK Men's Micro Modal Trunks. Their construction is good but honestly, they're a bit too short and therefore not as comfortable. When I'm walking especially, I feel them hiking up my thighs and not staying put whereas the ExOfficio underwear, the legs are longer and tighter and stays put. I would definitely would have bought more if they didn't hike up my legs because they are slightly more comfortable than the ExOfficio but honestly, they're both so comfortable, I'd choose the ExOfficio over these any day.I wear ExOfficios every day now and will only wear this pair of CK trunks when I'm completely out of clean ExOfficio underwear and don't have time to do laundry."
3,"Meh, not worth the price","I bought these a while ago because I was looking for something to switch to from the cheap Hanes boxer briefs I used to wear. Specifically, I was looking for a snug fit. Anyway, these aren't bad, but one pair was enough, as I found much better alternatives (compression shorts are great). They're decent in support and tightness, but the short inseam tended to allow them to ride up on the legs. Wasn't too impressed with the fabric either. Started out nice in texture, but started to pill after a while. I prefer polyester and nylon.Overall, not too bad, but not that great either. More comfortable than cheap stuff like Hanes, but $10-$12 seems like a more appropriate price."
5,My boyfriend love it!,"He said are very comfortable, soft and fit perfectly. Definitely, I recommend to buy this product. Also, it arrived before the estimated date."
3,Great feel & look but support doesn't hold up (pun intended),"I'm a huge fan of Calvin's briefs for many years now, so I thought I'd give these a try. While they felt great on they lost their support after several washing n wear. Also, I thought they were way over-priced (made in Egypt); however I thought I might over-look the price if I loved them as much as or most than my other Calvin underwear. So I probably won't be buying another pair, but I'll keep these around for those special moments because of their look and feel :)."
4,Great product,"I purchased two of this product at Dillards and found the material to be fantastic. It is smooth and soft but supportive. I decided to try this shorter size and I purchased two. The material is the same but i like the shorter style more than the longer items i purchased at Dillards. Very nice.Thanks,"
5,Great Pair Of Underwear,"I bought one pair of these CK's at first to see if they would be comfortable, then after my initial purchase I bought another half dozen since I liked the quality & fit & comfort. I would highly recommend this product if one is happy with the style & visual, then take it from someone who's typing to you and wearing the orange color CK's as I type - they're comfortable & a decent quality product."
3,Rises up,"This Micro Modal Trunk is just a low rise trunk in reality. When you sit down the, the legs rise up on you and basically makes it one of Calvin Klein's low rise trunks. Obviously the models in the picture have not sat down with the trunks they are wearing before they took their pictures. After sitting down and then standing up, your ""junk"" is lower than the bands that go around your legs. So this is just a heads up to anyone who doesn't want this to happen.Other than this, the modal material is extremely soft and luxurious. If you don't mind having a low rise trunk then buy this."
5,Great Boxers! Very comfortable and durable.,"Those boxers are great! are amazing, they fix perfectly with your body. I'm from Ecuador and in here those boxers are so expensive and also so hard to find. I recommend those boxers, they worth the price."
2,Not for the average joe,"I have CK modal pants and love them and wanted to like the trunks. I also have other CK boxers and boxer briefs, which are durable.The material is definitely awesome. Unfortunately, the short length of the legs and ""stretch tight"" fit make them somewhat uncomfortable and also ridiculous looking (the ""micro"" name is definitely appropriate). Even if I had a six pack, I think I would go with something with a longer leg for comfort and because these just look too small. I returned the unopened pairs. Bottom line is that the ""micros"" aren't for everybody, including me, but they are definitely a good option for some."
2,Uncomfortable,"These ride up very quickly and worst of all hold my package to close which causes a slight pain after a day of wear. The only plus is the material, it is nice. I'm not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, perhaps its my body shape (muscular legs, slim waste, larger than average package)."
3,Just Ok....,"These are ok, the boxer brief version of these is much better. The legs are shorter and don't support as much."
2,Bigger than I expected,"I wear 34 and so ordered size L which should fit me. But when I tried them on, they were loose. I haven't worn them as much as I wanted to."
5,Calvin has finally left some room up front.,These are a good fit. Snug where you want it and room where you need it. Finally Calvin has given us room up front to breath.
1,Loosens with time,"To me it just feels like $20 wasted. I liked it a lot the first week, but since then it has been like any other average trunk, loose and sticking uncomfortable in the back while providing zero support at the front. When I bought these I also bought a pair of boxers from Under Armour and they have been incredibly good quality. I have ordered a pair ofMen's M Series Sports Briefs Bottoms by Under Armouras a replacement for these low quality CK ones."
5,"Far and away, the most comfortable I've ever worn","These things are just plain comfortable. They are also very well built, lightweight, and cool. There's no going back now. The price is a bit high, but I find them to be worth the extra money, and I think I'm worth it. :)"
3,Nice trunk for the price.,"I'm happy with the fit of these trunks and the feel of the fabric. The inseam could be a bit longer but no too big of an issue. They do move well and breath well. The pouch front is a bonus, prefer this to traditional front trunk! I would buy these again."
3,Closer.. still not there.,"I have been on a hunt for some elastic-y, comfortable and fashionable boxer briefs which most importantly don't ride up. These are very comfortable and made of a nice soft stretchy material. They fit very well and look good to boot. Unfortauntely I can't say that they stay put. After having them on for a couple hours they ride up at least a few inches, even pinching in the middle a bit. The hunt continues..."
2,Not overly impressed,"I was hoping for a better design. The pouch is perfect, but the surrounding material moves under my jeans and gets the roll on the leg. Was hoping for better"
5,Super soft,"Got these for my boyfriend and he is obsessed. they're really soft, and even though they're a little on the short side, he loves them."
2,Small tear near crotch,"1st) I really enjoy the underwear--very comfortable and a sexy look!*After the first time wearing the underwear I noticed a small tear near the crotch where a small hole exposes skin. It's pretty small but I should return for the price I paid for them. 2 pairs were received and the other one is just fine. I've never had a tear in any of my underwear, could just be a faulty pair."
4,Two out of three ain't bad,"I bought three pairs of these based on the reviews and I really like them a lot. One pair, however, is already unraveling at the hem after only one washing."
5,Nice Underwear,"I have owned these for about 2 months, they still look great. I tried 3 different kinds of synthetic underwear and these are the only ones that fit similar to tighty-whities, although they look much better. They last longer and feel softer as well.A bit expensive but I went back and bought 5 more pairs after trying the first one."
3,Jabra EarBoom for Nokia 5100 and 6100 Series Phones,I love the ear piece but the headset clip has already fallen apart and I have had it less than 6 months and have not used it all that much. Without the clip I am always disconnecting people with the disconnect button the the cord. I am bummed and don't want to buy another because I am afraid the same thing will happen.
2,"""it's kinda bad""","The earpiece is nice and relatively comfortable. The microphone quality isn't too good. This is the only earboom-type product I have tried, so I can't compare it to others. I only hope some other brands are better because the microphone on this doesn't pick up sounds very well unless you are in a quiet environment. I find I have to speak very loudly for people to understand me if I am using this while driving (which is the whole point of buying one of these) and it frustrates the person I have called. It isn't bad if you are stopped in traffic, however it doesn't work very well for driving. Perhaps your car has less wind noise than my 1997 Honda Civic..."
2,Not too good.,"I've had this thing for a while(1 year) and while I can hear well enough, it sometimes irritates my ear. The microphone leaves a lot to be desired. When the foam microphone cover disintegrated I bought a Jabra Earwave boom headset out of desperation and I find the earpiece more comfortable and even though I wear glasses the ""over ear"" design works fine but the best part is the microphone, people hear me clearly and conversations are easier now. I'd say you can do better than the EarBoom. Get the EarWave Boom instead!"
2,Nice but not comfortable?,My 24 month old won't wear these and she has other sandals that have never had an issue. She doesn't like the way they feel. She will sometimes wear them with socks but they were mostly a waste to buy and I can't make her wear them.
5,Love Love Love these shoes,"I ordered these shoes for my very active 6 year old. She loves that they are so easy for her to put on and they stay on her feet even when she is all hot and sweating these shoes don't make her feet slip around inside them. She has been hiking in them, running, playing and just laying around. They are so great. I just throw them in the washer and they look good as new. Worth every penny."
3,Sized small,"I'm a huge fan of Tevas and thought these would be great for my 2 year old. Using Amazon's sizing instructions, we purchased a pair. They ended up being so tight they gave him blisters.I recommend buying at least one size larger.The quality looks like standard Tevas; my 3 star rating is based solely on the fact that the shoes didn't fit."
3,"not for ""thick"" feet. but a great shoe.",Just ordered these shoes for my twin sons. I ordered a 2 and a 3. One of my sons has thicker feet (not wider) and he was unable to even get the size 2 on. He couldn't slide his toes into the front because it was so low. But he did fit the 3. So now I have a 2 I can't use. But we got a great deal on them. These look like great shoes for 8yr old boys.
5,Super Sandals!,Every year I buy this super sandals for my dauthers. They use them all summer.Very good sandals for a good price! Even great for small feet.Elk jaar koop ik deze geweldige sandalen voor mijn dochters. Zij dragen ze de hele zomer. Hele goede sandalen voor een goede prijs! Ook geweldig voor smalle voeten.
3,Nice shoes but too small,"These shoes look very nice and comfortable. However, the size is too small. The size-10 shoes I received are about size 8.5 of regular sneakers. So be very careful."
5,Best sandals ever!! I love these!!,"These sandals are the best!! I love that they have a covered toe while still being such an open sandal. They are constructed very well and are super sturdy!! I bought my son and daughter a pair last summer and we loved them so much we got more this summer. If the ones from last summer still fit, they would still be wearing them!! Tons of life left!! I love the rubber sole on the inside, better than most sandals that have a liner inside that eventually gets yucky and comes apart. Very easy to wash as well!! When the shoes became filthy, I filled up my sink with some bleach water and threw them in to soak, they came out looking new and the bleach didn't affect the colors. I have recommended these to all my friends with children, I love them!!"
1,Manufacturing Defect,"Tevas are great sandals. However, the ones that I've ordered through Amazon are defective. There are sharp, little nubs sticking up on various places of the sole where the foot is placed--very uncomfortable. All three pairs of this sandal model that I received (after several exchanges) have had this problem. Some pairs were worse than others. I'm about to return the third and final pair. It must be a manufacturing defect, as none of the other Tevas models that we own have this problem. Hopefully, the pairs of sandals that we returned are taken out of distribution (i.e., not passed on to other customers)."
3,Good Stroller,"We have a 5 month old and a 21 month old and have had our Duoglider since our second child was born. We had a Quattro Tour with our first, and nothing can compare with that stroller! For a double, this is good with the typical cons that accompany any vehicle made to push around two growing children plus gear. All other reviews I've read are correct in regards to pros/cons. It would be wise to see this stroller in person if you have the chance - it IS NOT a single stroller and you do have to put up with some inconveniences but this is one of the better strollers in it's class. I gave it three stars because the front wheels can't take too much punishment (like steep curbs or uneven pavement) without rattling and skidding. I take this on a walk everyday and my arms have never been stronger since I've been keeping this thing from skidding off the sidewalk."
4,Not bad for a double,"This is our second tandem double stroller we have purchased. We like just about everything on the stroller. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would prefer if it had a side step for the back seat and the closing handle is a little weird to get used to. Other then that, it's a nice stroller. We have a 5 yr old, a 2 yr old, and another one on the way, so a double stroller is a necessity for us. Not a bad purchase for the money."
4,"Wonderful stroller, horrible to clean","We have loved our DuoGlider for years, it works great, but today for the first time I took it apart to wash the fabric parts. It was a nightmare! After unscrewing many screws I was able to get everything off except for the top back canopy. It is screwed in with something that cannot be removed...there is no way to take off the piece that it is attached too! So, everything else will be clean and look new and the top most noticable part will still be dirty! AHH! That was really frustrating to find and thought other moms might want to know it! It is my only complaint about the stroller though!"
4,good,"well, i only got it for 7 dollars of of ebay, but its worth it for under 10 bucks. Its sort of like a big piece of paper with the crass sighn on it. There is white on the edges but it is a collectors item."
2,"Works, but fragile.","Well, I've used this, and I also used the Nokia earbud that came with my phone. One thing I've noticed is the connector to Nokia phones is fragile. I dropped my phone once when it was connected and the quality noticably declined (same with the included earbud). After that I had people had a hard time hearing me, just as another reviewer had mentiond. I also had the problem with loosing the gel covers. I went through 3 of them, and they repeatedly fell off. The last failure mode is the earpiece itself. It got caught and completely fell apart. I am using a retractable earbud now that has a standard plug with a Nokia adapter. Much better quality than I ever had with either this or the included earbud. Also, the Nokia adapter is replacable, so I've eliminated one failure mode."
1,Doesn't do the job while driving,"The only nice thing I can say about this product is that it has a comfortable earpiece. Their ear-gels do fit like a glove and are quite comfortable. However, I couldn't hear through mine very well. Furthermore, the microphone had to be practically in my mouth in order for me to be heard. That may be because I frequently drive with the windows open, and even with the windows closed my car is slightly (but just slightly) noisier than average. I am currently in the market for something else at this point."
5,So far so good,"Holds a Ruger Speed Six .357 mag with a 2-3/4"" barrel. I also keep a Master trigger lock on it. Everything fits nicely."
3,Its HUGE.,I purchased this for my S&W M&P 9c. Went with the medium because I figured it would be enough room for the weapon and a few extra mags. It was intended for my gym bag or when I needed to put my weapon somewhere while on vacation. Havent really used it bec it much bigger than what I planned.
3,"OK bag, but arrived smelling musty","I guess this bag will serve its purpose, but when I took it out of the box (box was dry), it had a distinct musty mildewy odor. Tried spraying it with Lysol and that helped a bit, but it still smells like mildew. I might try leaving it out in the sun for a while.Also, after the bag is opened all the way, I found it difficult to close the zipper again because the zipper closer is now in the crease of the bag with both sides pointing away from each other."
3,Good Product but undersized,"I like the rug. But it says it fits 4"" barrel revolvers. My .357 mag S&W is a way too large for it. So, I will probably give it away. They need to give examples of common revolvers and which rugs work for them."
4,Uncle Mike's Medium Pistol Rug,"Quick delivery. My Springfield XDm 9mm just barely fits, so if you have a semi-auto with a barrel longer than 4"" or your gun is more than 5.6"" high, look for a large, because it's not going in this. Mine is 3.8"" and it is tight. Gun is 5.6"" x 7"" long, just to give you a reference point. 5.7"" high would not have fit."
4,Price was right,Good price but I should have listened to a previous reviewer - this is not for larger automatics. Too tight for a Beretta 92FS. External dimensions 11.5 x 6.5in. Hard outer & reasonably soft inner padding. A little bit bulky. A S&W M&P340 hammerless fits easily. Hope this helps others - if you buy a different size please leave a review of the dimensions.
5,Pistol Case,"Product was represented correctly. Holds 2"" S&W; 38 or 3"" 9mm.Shipment was prompt. Quality was excellent. I would order again."
4,Uncle Mike's Medium Pistol Rug (Black),"Holds my Glock 17. Not much more room than that though. Happy for $10.00, I can not give it 5 stars due to its not USA made"
2,Meh....,"Typical Uncle Mikes product. Its cheap and it shows, but it does its job and when it falls apart you can just buy another one."
5,My wife loves hers,"Hy wife was having a hard time sleeping while pregnant. One night as I watched her toss and turn I decided to do soemthing for her. I went to Target and bought her the boppy body pillow. That night she slpet sound for the first time in over a month.She drags the thing from room to room in the house, she lays on it to watch tv and to sleep.It does take up some room in the bed, but it is well worth me having a little less room for her to sleep sound.Also a few times I have stolen it and used it while I lay on the ground and watch football. It is very comfy.I have never been a pregnant woman, but from what my wife tells me this is a must have."
5,Always awesome!,"This show never fails to satisfy. The cast has been so well chosen, and they work so well together. This show's humor is hysterically original, while the drama often leaves me with my mouth hanging open. I love Nancy's relationship with Conrad,Andy's lack of propriety,Shane's wackiness,Heylia's ""tell it like it is"" insight and,just when Celia couldn't be more annoying, Nancy putting her in her place. Not one episode disappoints."
3,weeds season 3,the case of this product was ripped up and did not look at all new. that should have been included in the description along with a price reduction
3,Weeds change up,"I fell in love with Weeds after first season...second...third season. Fourth season left me feeling disappointed and disillusioned. The characters personalities morph and the story line fades away from weeds into deeper illegal exploits. What ended the ""love affair"" for me was, season 4; when Nancy pistol whips Ceilia; shocking, to say the least. I asked around my social circle how they found the series? they didn't get past season 4 either. Hmmm...interesting Weeds lasted 7 years. I'm holding out for Firefly's return!"
5,weeds great show,I absoluetly love this show im so glad we discovered it!! Its funny and entertaining and its the best to have on dvd you don't have to pay for the extra channel and you don't have to worry about missing an episode my boyfried and i watch the seasons over and over when we get bored with tv/other movies!!
5,I love this tv show.,I recently bought all the seasons of Weeds because I am obsessed with this show. Season 3 is one of my favorites and I am so happy amazon.com had the product.
5,I'm so Hooked!,Season 3 is Awesome. My husband and I enjoy this TV show so much. Each Character has such a unique part. We are so hooked. I preordered season 4 and can't wait to get that one. I just hope this show goes many more seasons. You won't be dissatisfied.
5,far out!,A show with great actors and good acting. Funny and series at the same time. For anyone my age (60) a must see.
1,Don't order this as it won't work in your DVD player!!!,I ordered this thinking it was a normal DVD and recieved two Blu-ray discs that don't work in my ordinary DVD player. How frustrating and sneaky of the distributors not to make this extremely explicate!I want my money back
2,Worse of the 3 seasons,The story weakened significantly in this 3rd season. The way it ended I really hope this is the end of the series.
2,retun item,"i returned this ite because we allready have it, i spoke to some in the return department i should have a credit, i would like to recieve weeds 4 or nip tuck season 5 part two when it comes out thank you john venables"
1,Scratches...,"Don't get me wrong, I love WEEDS, and have every season avaliable on DVD. I was very happy when I got this DVD, I had never seen Season 3 and was anxious to watch it. However, I was shocked when I saw the ""Green packaging"" thing on the back cover... yay, another cheap cardboard package. This is every bit as bad as the ""There Will Be Blood"" packaging... and that's saying something. It took me about 20 minutes to get disc 1 out alone!!! I am never putting the DVDs back in that case again... I put the DVDs in regular CD cases after getting them out. The discs came out all scratched too when I finally got them out. It's like one of those ""expanded"" hallmark cards just with DVDs thrown in. I know it's good that they care for the enviroment, but geez, give us a decent DVD package!!"
5,Another Awesome Season...,"Season Three of Weeds continues with the insanity and hilarity that the previous two seasons brought. You will NOT be disappointed with this season, and it will leave you waiting anxiously for the fourth season..."
3,review,"the item came quickly, but one of the discs had sticky stuff on it..took a lot to get it off."
5,HILARIOUS!!!!!!,This TV series will keep you going back for more. If you think you're going to be able to watch this an episode at a time your nuts. You'll start watching it and with all the unbelievable humor and cliff hangers you'll start watching this a disc at a time. Before you know it your through the season and onto the next. Nancy Botwin makes the life look easy but you can't help but feel for her and empathize for her when she goes through all that she does.
2,A parody of itself,"The weakest Weeds season to be sure. According to Jenji Kohan, the show's creator, the writers were getting ""bored"". It shows in spades. The characters shamble through increasingly uninteresting and crude scenarios. The show's dark, satirical wit is gone in favor of poop jokes, porno, and lazy sex scenes. The characters still treat each other with the requisite malice and distaste, but the spark seems to be going out. (Thankfully I'm in Season 4 now and things are back to normal.) The production values are shoddy, the humor is weak/scatological, the satire is diluted, the new characters are boring and killed quickly or hang around far too long (one S. Graff--BORING)) All in all, a trite effort from such a promising, fledgling series."
5,3 seasons and still very funny,I really love this show. The third season is just as good as the first. The writer's are doing a great job in keeping the seris fresh and funny. Now I have to say I first liked the show because I think Nancy is one very very hot lady but now I watch it for that reason and a lot more. Everyone does a great job playing their roles. You will not regret buying this show.
2,Weeds season 3,Its seems there is a disk missing. there is 3 in total but from season 3 to sesason 4 there is heaps missing.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this item, Weeds - Season 3, under the impression that it was a used product in ""like new"" condition. I was very disappointed and frustrated when I learned that 2 of the 3 discs in the box set were badly scratched, making some portions of several episodes impossible to view. I order used DVDs on Amazon fairly regularly; however, this is the first time I feel like I have been misled regarding the condition of the purchased item. I certainly hope it will be the last."
5,great buy,no issues with this one loved it watched it three time's already this is a great show so sad its ending soon
4,still good,We are addicted so we had to have the next season. Could this woman get in any more trouble than she is already in? We will find out!
1,WARNING,"WEED THREE SEASON IS FINE BUT THE DVD CASE IT COMES IN IS A WASTE, ALL 3 DISC'S WILL ARRIVE LOOSE AND ALL SCRATCHED DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON BUY FROM A LOCAL STORE ."
1,"STill fun, but dark",The series is fun and this installment is no exception. It is dark though and makes you wonder why you like these zany and really flawed characters!
2,"Weeds, 3rd season","This was called NEW, and in the wrapper when we received it. It did however have a missing episode in it, which was a disappointment."
2,"Catchy, But Hopefully The Final","Weeds Season 3 was a ""good while it lasted"" type of season. The first season really caught my eye and had me wondering what would happen next week, while the second season continued that want of mine to see what was going to happen next. Unfortunately, after I laughed once or twice per episode in season 3, I realized all good things come to an end and that is what I think now of Weeds. The storyline of selling weed, gangs and the upkeep of the community turned more into a ""Days Of Our Lives"" venture rather than a good fun-loving comedy/Satire. It MAY be worth renting but other than that, it's done. Even if they continue the show, I no longer have the desire to watch it."
2,Would give this show 4 stars if...,"the liberal writers would leave their Bush and Christianity jabs out and stop pushing Prius! A big-bad-heroin-dealer buys seven for his ""employees""?! Come ON!! Also getting too unbelievable that Nancy cares more about being green than she does about bringing her kids into the business. The pilot had the republican jabs but it was interesting enough to want to watch the next episode and so on and so on... but it's getting ridiculous! Don't know if I can put up with the liberal BS through the 5th season I've already bought..."
4,Weeds season 3,"Still entertaining, although not as believable. Everything seems really over-the-top. Weeds is still my favorite show though! *a note on the packaging. The discs weren't clicked in and they were rubbing around during shipping. I thought they were used at first since there were scratches on the them right out of the package."
2,Pretty much a catastrophe,"While season I and II were nothing short of extraordinary and riveting, season III amounts, IMO, to a massive crash-and-burn of epic proportions. While the writing in the first two season was deep, consistent, mature and kept the story line, this third season has pretty much decimated any good the first two seasons had. The series took on a bad, bad puerile collegiate-preachy tone that's pretty disheartening at times. Characters have become flat, insipid and inane. Situations tend to solve themselves rather trivially and almost in a sit-com fashion. I truly think this was originally a 2-season show that has been artificially drawn out due to the immense popularity the show enjoyed in its first two season. Nothing short of an atrocity. A true shame."
2,Season 3 is kind of boring and uninteresting...,I was addicted to season 1 & 2 but Season 3 is kind of boring compared to the first two. The storylines go all over the place and it's just not that interesting. I am currently watching episode 6 of Season 3.
3,OK I Guess,"The thing that took the edge off for me was the cheap slipshot packaging this Season 3 DVD Set came packaged in; talk about cheap! The DVD's had tape residue on them from the small dots of tape that held down the DVD's; once again, talk about cheap! I had to use a paper towel and lighter fluid to remove the tape residue. DVD's were OK, but I've got a bad taste in my mouth over this experience and from what the seller told me, it's Showtimes doing as to the green friendly packaging."
3,"BD format review, not Weeds","okay, I got in to Weeds on a recommendation from a friend...I am totally addicted. This review is not about the show but, about the format. I went with Blu-ray format so I could check it out on my new LED television and BD player. I am a bit disappointed in the quality - it is little better than a standard DVD that has been up-converted. I was able to get seasons 1-3 on sale at Amazon for same price as the regular DVD so, at least I didn't over-pay. But, if I had shelled out the full-price, I would be upset about it. If you can get it on sale, go for it. But, don't expect a lot of WOW factor."
5,I smelled this one coming,"Wow, this is for you if you enjoy farting in public and belching at socially unacceptable times in public places. You can't help but laugh. How long depends upon your maturity level. I laughed for the entire length of the album if that gives you any hints to my stunted maturity. Powerful renditions of some of your holiday favorites, make for a savory and exploratory sensual experience. Irreverent and silly, but my guess is that you will laugh and or vomit. Either way, you get your money's worth. Enjoy!"
3,Not same quality as original,These brushes are exceptional for long thick hair but the Bristles on the 2 I purchased are very flimsy. Stick with purchasing from Nordstrom or Hair Salons.
1,Be aware that you will wait for six weeks to receive this item,I was not aware that this item ships from England and must be coming by goldfish as the shipment is going to take six weeks to arrive according to their information. I wrote to them three time to trace the package but never got the courtesy of a reply. Amazon will not let me cancel or for that matter ask for help until the entire time has elapsed. Not worth the effort!
4,Great travel brush!,"This is a great brush! Unless you have long and thick hair! Then it would be too small for you, but if not, I definitely recommend it as a travel brush! It didn't work for me because of my long and thick hair, but it might work for you. Best brushes ever!"
5,Best Pokemon merchandise out here!!!,"Although this US version is quite censored, I can recommend it to any Pokemon fan, but it is absolute must have for any Rocketshipper! It is quite Ash-bashing despite the title. And there are also the most beautiful pictures of Jessie and James! The art style is marvelous and Mr.Ono's humour is great, too!!!I like The Electric Pikachu Boogaloo the best from all 4 manga books by Toshihiro Ono. This series is one of my most favourite mangas (beside Cardcaptor Sakura and Gunsmith Cats).Read it and you will see why! If you are manga fan and want quality, try this Pokemon manga series. It it not childish, I'm 20 and I enjoyed it very much!"
3,Super Reader,"Penelope is a young girl with a superhuman ability, she can see a short distance into the future. She is no Fafhrd, so runs into Mouse, who becomes her protector.A bounty hunter has been tracking Penelope for a long time, as she is seen as a threat to plans of the powerful.Mouse the thief has probably gotten in over her head."
2,"sorry, didn't work","The story itself didn't work for me.Yes, the characterization was pretty good.Yes, the precog element was well thought through.No, that's not enough.The story was told from the Mouse's viewpoint the whole way through -- right up to the very end, and then there was an abrupt switch. It added, I suppose, to the surprise, but I thought it was a fundamentally dishonest way to deal with the reader. Come on, play fair! Anyone can think through precog and throw around intriguing characters. It's not enough. Bring it together and make it work.Thumbs down."
3,Doesn't deliver,"Mr. McWhorter says it is inconceivable that anyone in America today would make a statement such as, ""Wow, I love the way she (or he) uses English"". But, in fact, that's a close approximation to what I said to myself when I heard Mr. McWhorter interviewed and why I went out and bought his book. Although he documents with trained ease the decline of written and spoken English, I was left with the impression that he's not going to take his hands off the keyboard and do any dirty, heavy lifting to reverse the trend. Makes me think of the young man in the FedEx commercial who has an MBA and doesn't ""do shipping"". An interesting read but in the end disappointing."
2,McWhorter should learn grammar,"In only the first chapter of McWhorter's nmew book, I found a half dozen grammatical errors, nor to mention the fact that McWhorter believes that ""artful"" means something that is praiseworthy for being artistic. ""Artful"" means sleazy, sneaky, dishonest. Doesn't this professor of language know that?In addition, there is repeated flouting of the rules on the use of pronouns. Here is a sentence that you must re-read a few times to parse: ""The person who only processes information beyond their immediate purview in nuggets is not educated in any meaningful sense."" What does ""their"" refer to? Is it really what McWhoreter wanted to write?And he commits what this retired copy editor regards as the cardinal sin: ""He might not have even made it off of the lectern.""The ""of"" after ""off"" is a crime. But beyond that, the ""even"" belongs before the ""have."""
2,"Yes, but. . .","I was disappointed in this book. Several times while reading it I was tempted to toss it aside and pick up something more worthwile, but I plodded through it to the end.The author, a linguist, has an admitted distaste for ""traditional"" rules of grammer. (Which explains why he butchers grammer throughout the book.) He decrys the degradation of literature (and music), but at the same time his own writing style is casually-styled (he even admits this at the end) and even vulgar throughout. On top of this, there are numerous places in which he misuses words (e.g., ""anymore"" instead of ""any more"" on p. 115).From another author on another topic, errors like that would be overlooked. But, for a LINGUIST writing a book lamenting over the degradation of language???In the end, I had to give him two stars, simply because I agree with the premise of his book. I just wish it had been better written. It's not one I can recommend to other readers."
1,Poisonous,"Here is McWhorter's argument supporting the superiority of, effectively, all art:Look at this passage of Longfellow! Listen to this Mozart aria! They just -- well -- SOUND so much better!If you don't believe me, you can certainly make an effort to read this, but isn't really worth it. (Sorry John, but your prose ain't stunning either.)This is the work of a cultural elitist, a rabid defender of the Western canon and opponent of artistic progress: the sort of guy who will wax poetic all day about Beethoven and Bach and Dante and Milton, but refuse to acknowledge the artistic legitimacy of Ives or Ligeti or Joyce or Nabokov.On the other hand, if sipping wine and listening to Handel's ""Water Music"" while discussing the same 4 Shakespeare plays every weekend is your idea of culture, then you've found your guy----but it probably still won't be a very interesting read."
2,Tempted to give it one star.,"This book makes the most grievous error a book can make: it's boring. The title sounded intriguing, but the book is a real snooze. I skipped page after page looking for something of interest to read. Alas, I found nothing. Talk about disappointment. I was hoping for a scathing analysis of the degradation of language in contemporary discourse and music. What I got was...well, I'm not sure but it put me to sleep within 5 minutes. I don't want to read in-depth analyses of speeches from 1856 or whatever. Maybe there's another book out there that discusses the devaluation of language in pop culture in a compelling way. This one ain't...I mean, isn't, it."
5,True life Scarface story with a moral and a happy ending...,"As a customer of Rob Vidal's(the author's)barbershop, I was intrigued overhearing him sharing some of his experiences with prison to keep kids off the street. When he told me he had a book coming out, I couldn't wait for its release. When I purchased his book, I read a chapter a night. Once I got to the fifth chapter, I couldn't put it down. If you are entertained the Sopranos, Scarface or any other mobster show or movie, definitely pick up this book. After all this is the real thing."
3,"Well written, but not a fun read...","I loved The Slap. This one, I think I'm not the target group (40s female). Too nihilistic & cynical for me, but well written and a good insight into the world of the characters."
5,Excellent!!,"I'm a huge fan of Camilleri, and this book is another in a long line of riveting mysteries that combine humor, local color, suspense -- and don't forget descriptions of mouth-watering Italian cuisine!"
4,Sicilian detective adventures,"Enjoyed this mystery and looking forward to reading others. It could be because I am Sicilian and recently visited Sicily so it was so easy to imagine what he was talking about. There are good notes, too, that help with various idomatic references I might not understand."
4,Another enjoyable read by Camilleri,"When the police car of Inspector Montalbano hits a small car parked at an apparently deserted country home, the inspector has a gut feeling that something is wrong. He finds the body of a beautiful woman, strangled in her bedroom. After a short while it turns out that the woman has numerous acquaintances in the area and that there are a fair number of suspects. The investigation is not made any easier by the fact that Montalbano's superiors are not exactly supporting him, even though his own team is squarely behind him. A combination of good policework and flashes of brilliance in the end solves the crime. In the meantime Montalbano also has to sort out the mess that he is making of his private life. And that is the nice thing about this series: it is the combination of police work and private hassles, that make Montalbano into more than your average, typical policeman-from-a-novel, but rather a real character with his good and his bad sides."
4,Most Excellent,"This is an excellent CD. Each of the individual players are fantastic in their own right, and together they create some wonderful music. The drummer, Darren Beckett, has a very active style of play - it's as though he's not only keeping time, but continually soloing throughout the CD. Greg Tuohey, the guitar player and Jerome Sabbagh, the saxophone player bring a great sense of melody to the mix. They both play very inventive yet logical lines and express a sense of maturity well beyond their years. Matt Penman rounds out this quartet on bass, and helps tie it all together. If you like good, straight-ahead jazz with a modern edge, I highly recommend this CD."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"I consider myself to be as big an industrial fan as any. But, I own EVERY Gary Numan CD and EVERY NIN CD and I can tell you right now this is not ""Gary Numan"" or ""NIN"" in any way.Sorry Ade, but using all the same synthesizers that Trent Reznor uses does not make you ""Trent Reznor"". And having Gary Numan sing on your tracks does not make you ""Gary Numan"". These songs were so boring and the lyrics corny. I've listened to this CD 7 times hoping it would grow on me. It didn't. This work is far inferior to the artists he tries to emulate.Go ahead and buy it if you must. I had to due to all the hype. But I was sorely disappointed."
2,Fiesta Tray,I got this a year ago Christmas when looking for a serving tray as a gift. I guess I missed the size description because it was about a tenth the size I was expecting. About the size of a dozen crackers and 2 oz of cheese. I still have it sitting in the closet.
1,Insomnia?,"I'm a voracious reader. However, it took me three weeks to finish this book - because everytime I started reading it, it put me to sleep. Deathly slow plot, constant, annoying repetitions of the same events ... this was unquestionably one of the most disappointing books I've ever read. The characters were not at all engaging, and when something DID happen with the storyline, it was so silly it was impossible to even WANT to believe it. This is the first - and last - book by Ms. Brandewyne for me."
1,Ninefold key opens no doors,This is a fictional thriller with a tiny little romance filtered into the story line. The characters don't actually meet till several long chapters into the book. Unimpressed.
1,Forcing myself to finish it,"I LOVE historical romance novels, reading 1-2 a week. Frankly, I'm pretty easy to please. I can overlook poor proof reading (once, a main character's name was wrong for 3 whole pages!) or glitches in the plot, but this book is plain BORING! There is very little romance and by the time I got to it, I just didn't care anymore. I've read dozens of books by this author and find it hard to believe she wrote this. At 450 pages, save your time and pass on this one!"
3,Where did the storytellers go?,"3DO has continued its decline. In HH4 you got several campaigns that were all stand alone with no concluding campaign, however you were given a continuous story that tied each scenario together, while the stories may not have been compelling in many cases, they were there. In Gathering storm they have added a concluding campaign uniting the individual campaigns together. What they forgot in several cases was the story in the initial campaigns. In fact, in one campaign except for a small text box between scenarios there was no story line developed during the scenario. You got the impression they just strung 3 randomly generated maps together."
1,A Rip Off,"This was the last hurrah of 3DO. They basically put this on the shelf, sold a bunch, and then closed their doors. This game is weak and full of bugs. Overall it is a very shoddy product. I was so angry after I bought it I almost sought out my local District Attorney to see about suing this company, but they had already closed the shop."
1,won't install,"Even though I have had the Heros IV on my computer for quite awhile and I have played it to death, the expansion pack says it isn't there and refuses to install! I have already sold my original Heros IV cd, so now I'll have to find someone who wants to buy this one."
4,Muy bueno,"Es una trampa muy util, solamente que retiene no retiene carnada muy pequeña. Se soluciona con un poco de cuerda entre espacios y sin duda paciencia para realizarlo."
3,A bit disappointing,Figures are not really well depicted and small. Also they are really weird looking.I was a bit disappointed in the book.
5,THE Total Galapagos Adventure Guide - Not Just for Divers!,"This excellently written and stunningly photographed book is all anyone needs to take off for an exciting adventure in the Galapagos. And, while it covers everything divers need, it's also chock full of information about undertaking other outdoor adventures and the Islands themselves -- how to get around, history, above-ground flora and fauna, the rich undersea world, geography, and lots more. If you're the outdoors type, this book is an absolute must for any sojourn in the Galapagos..."
5,Resourceful and accurate,"Very resourceful book for dive sites, expected marine life, and underwater photo top. So far for the dive sites I have done, the descriptions are quite accurate. Highly recommend this book to other divers."
2,Got standard instead of covert,Only 2 starts because I specially wanted the covert model but got the standard instead.One button function selection takes a while to get used to.Besides that good quality and powerful keyring lamp.
3,Not as good as the Photon Freedom (non-covert version),"I have both the regular and covert version of the Photon freedom and other than the nose cover, they are identical in features. The only thing the covert nose does is to mildly reduce the spill. It doesn't make the hot spot any brighter so the effect is merely to reduce the overall light output. And even with the nose cover there is still a moderate amount of light spill. It isn't as though the beam is tightly focused. The tint of the light was also rather greenish, although tint can vary a lot even between different batches of the same light. The kicker is that it's also more expensive than the non-covert version. Buy the regularLRI FMW Photon Freedom LED Keychain Micro-Light, White Beaminstead. It's a better version for less money."
3,A Handy Little UV Light,I bought this for use while travelling to see just how clean the hotel rooms really are... It works! The only thing I don't like is that it turns itself off after 10 seconds or so. I found myself turning it back on repeatedly.
3,Photon Freedom light,"I have had an original Photon micro light for years, one of the ones with the green LED. Never had a problem with it, never replaced a battery. So when it started getting a little dim I decided to catch a sale on a new one and saw the Freedom version with the clip mount and stuff and bought that, with a white bulb.Within a month I had to buy batteries, which cost half what I paid for the light, because I kept taking my keys out of my pocket and the light would be on. The old light had a pressure switch, it might get turned on, but when the pressure was off it went off. The new one has a click on click off switch and it would get turned on and stay on. In less than a month of carrying it in my pocket I ran the batteries completely dead. I won't be without a Photon so I just ordered one of the older models with a white bulb and pressure switch."
3,About like others,"I was hoping for more. Difficult to turn on, especially in the dark. The light is good, however, but I'm going to look for something else."
2,Too complex and buggy,"It took three until I found one that worked - and then it was still buggy. You can't simply press the button and have it turn on. It's a complex set of instructions. Press. Hold. Press again. Hold for a certain amount of time. The next time it *may* remember the previous setting, but usually not. If you just need a simple keychain flashlight, skip it. Too many bells and whistles to be actually useful."
5,Let me shed some light on this product.,"Great purchase, I always keep one on my keychain as an emergency light. There are cheaper alternatives. However, I can think of better places to skimp on money than an emergency light. For the extra money I have the best build quality, features, and reliability possible in a pocket light.I should mention that I use the red so that I can light things up and still preserve my night vision."
5,Tuku ndizvo!,"Tuku is the best that ever did it. I did not appreciate his music as much when I lived in Zimbabwe but now that I am abroad, I see what the rest of the world sees. A fantastic artist who is greatness & destined for so much more. If you have never seen him live, you are truly missing out. Shoutout to Kenny Neshamba on the drums & Picky Kasamba on background vocals."
5,I want to thank you Tuku,"This is really a great album and artist and group. I agree...you don't get tired of his music; it just keeps getting better. Great spirit, rhythm, music. It feeds my heart and is great music to walk to! Tuku music takes me at least 2 listens to get into, and then I love it for good!"
5,The Bitter Time,"This book is really interesting and i really enjoyed reading this novel,i think that whoever reads this wonderfull novel will find lots of things that maybe no one knows about."
4,"interesting cd, and fun too","Most likely the best funk music occurs on the funk brothers 1&2 cds and the funk sisters cds at least those compilations have the best known vocalists and groups most folks would be familiar with. Altho none of the vocalist or bands are as powerful on this cd as the better known bands, its good to give other vocalists some recognition. I think Betty Barney was a quite brilliant vocalist, and I believe as music is in a resurrection process one may reasonably expect more of her material to become available.,"
5,Excellent Text Book,"I find Colander's coverage of Macroeconimcs clear and far more relevant and contextualized than many other text books on the market. He presents theory but also explains where the theory poorly represents the real world. I agree with another reviewer that the author is a bit wordy. He could be more concise, but I don't find his writing unclear or dull."
5,Warped and Twisted for Gary Larsen fans and others like that,"Why not explore this side of your psyche? Imagine a train, with two people looking out the window, seeing the landscape pass by. A large box with the words ""LIONEL"" looms in the distance...Is that to your taste? If it is, you'll like this:A man on his knees with his head in the oven, a suicide note pinned to his jacket on the chair. In the background, the landlady enters shouting,""Mr. Mitchell, you know you don't have kitchen privileges!""Yes, they are all this twisted. I hope you'll buy and enjoy..."
5,THE ADDAMS FAMILY!,"it just hit me this is the real mr. addams; the inspiration of one of my favorite old tv shows; the addams family! it turns out he's from new jersy and attended the university of pennsylvania, and the grand central school of art in nyc. his original fame was as a cartoonist for the new yorker magazine. so if you thought you saw this style of art somewhere else, you did. comparison with gary larsen is apt, but addams came first; by my calculations he'd be in his mid 70's now. his concepts are just great. we all owe a huge debt of gratitude for all his wonderfull stuff down through the years whether television or cartoon. thanks for this book specially, a real laugh and half, perfect for that gloomy fall day."
4,Special Gift,This was a gift for my younger sister in rememberence for our past summer's trip to visit the former home of George Marsh which we greatly enjoyed. I'm looking forward to her loaning it to me when she is finished and seeing his outlook on the books topic.
2,"It works, but get that thing out of my ear!!","Yup, it works. You can be heard talking and there is no microphone hanging around your head or hanging from a wire.However, you must like having things stuck in your ear, and really stuck. Unfortunately, I don't like things embedded in my ear, so I got a handsfree with the little mike hanging from the wire. I had to buy this because Ericsson does not allow standard headsets to plug into the T28W, but thats another problem."
5,Office Products - DVD Labels,The labels are good quality. I use them on all of my DVDs. They are a preferable alternative to labeling the jewel case - they prevent losing track of the content of a disc if it gets separated from the labeled case.
5,Embracing GGod: Praying With Teresa of Avilia,All that I fully expected and more. I have begun using the practices suggested. Am sure I willbe referring to the book many times. Much to Digest. I am sure will add much more to the spiritual dimension of my journey.
5,Beautiful Mobile,the mobile is beautiful and is the only one I found that matches the bedding on my daughter's crib. We love it!
5,Small Digital Camera Bag,My Sony T100 digital camera just fits in the case. It is very functional and looks great.
4,For the rower,"As a rower myself, I greatly enjoyed reading this book. It gave me a bit of insight into a coach's mind and into how I think about rowing. I don't know how someone without knowledge of the sport would feel reading this book because it doesn't give one great specifics about some rowing terms, but nothing one could not look-up. In that respect, it doesn't delve into lots of rowing terms so I don't think the non-rower would be overwhelmed. It was a fun read, written like a diary of the events of the day for a coach and his thoughts on what to change, how to understand his rowers, and how to make the most of a season. I don't know who edited this because there were a handful of grammatical errors that you will notice, but it really doesn't take away from the reading."
5,Another superb contribution to sports literature,"Thanks again to Brad Alan Lewis for this entertaining and illuminating look at the sport of rowing, and athletics in general. This is a fitting post script to Brad's earlier work, Assault on Lake Casitas, which is one of the best books on high level athletics ever written."
1,Mediciney after taste,"Geez, this was probably the worst tasting Met-Rx bar I've had yet! I've tasted cookie dough, double chocolate chip, and others--all which I've enjoyed. But there was something about this one that just tasted funny. A chemical aftertaste difficult to describe but definitely not pleasant to the palate. I bought a box of 12, so now I have to eat it all before I can get more. Consumre with lots of water and maybe a fruit (banana works well) to counter the aftertaste. I'm sure it has all the protein I need, but just wish it tasted better! Eww!"
1,Worst Big 100 Bar Flavor,Try a different flavor!!! I purchase all of the Big 100 bars and found this flavor (Chocolate Chip Graham Cracker) to be the worst! We ate 2 out of the box and threw the rest away - they were disgusting!
2,not a big fan of cookie dough,i thought it would be more of a graham cracker texture than a cookie dough. It does fill you though.
3,Not terrible but not great either,"The taste wasn't terrrible, but it was not great either. I managed to finish the box. It was filling as a meal replacement, but it wasn't the best tasting. I ordered the apple pie flavor also - much better."
1,Don't Get This Flavor,"I'm not picky about how my supplements taste, and I like most of the other Big 100 bars, but this one is awful. It tastes like several of the cheapest liquors you can buy mixed together, and almost burns your throat like it too for that matter. I wanted to throw it out every time I took a bite. Save your taste buds and your wallet, and pick another flavor."
2,Pressure is Tight,"I'm a long time Planet Asia fan and I gotta say this album seems like the pressure to appeal to the mainstream is finally getting to him. Though I gotta say his flow is unparalleled as usual. His beats lack depth and the organic feel they had pre-The Sickness(album),Which has more to do with the producer Evidence (of Dilated Peoples) than with the artist. However, he could have been more discriminating in choosing them. His lyrics are also progressively leaning more toward gangsta bravado, which I like to a certain extent as long as it's not compromising the quality of the music.All that being said, go cop The Grand Opening, Still in training etc. to form an accurate opinion of this artist and his potential."
5,soft!,"this sheep is cute and very soft! I took him to college with me ;) sometimes stuffed animals have a weird look to them (the way they're sewn or something), but this one is very cute AND realistic! How often do we see stuffed Big Horn sheep?! it's a nice change"
2,not the book I thought it would be,I purchased the book for a friend of mine who unfortunately had to have their dog put down. However upon receiving the book and reviewing it chose not to give the book as a gift. I felt that the description of the books contents were totally misleading. The book is more for someone whose pet is still alive and they are anticipating puting it to sleep. Not a book on coping with the loss after you have put your pet to sleep. So unfortunately I did not feel the book was a good choice as a gift. How disappointing.
2,Very Ordinary,"""Fluff"" for the bereavement shelf in book stores. Buy ""The Loss of A Pet"" by Dr. Wallace Sife instead. You won't be sorry ..."
3,it's for the real Bjoerling addict,"The first real phonography of Jussi Bjoerling recordings. The best phonography today is Harald Henryssons ""A Jussi Björling Phonography"" 2nd Edition Published by Svenskt Musikhistoriskt Arkiv, Stockholm 1993."
1,This gun is a piece of @&!%,"this gun is a piece of @&!%, when i got it for my birthday(which was 3 weeks after ordering it) it broke the first time i used it, the feeding tube snapped like a cheap twig, and the gun is now useless, so that is almost $80 wasted. the company hasnt even responded to me to get a replacement, and i doubt that they will send me one"
4,Wonderfully entertaining!,"My 3-year-old niece and I love to watch this movie. The story is an imaginative, highly entertaining variation on the classic Rapunzel fairy tale. The characters are vivid and believable and the graphics are beautiful (though the animation in all Barbie movies is fairly primitive). Highly recommended!"
5,Another Beautiful Barbie Tale,"The animation is beautiful, the music pretty. My girls, ages 6 and 4, adore this movie - they especially like the 'dressup Rapunzel' game on the DVD. The extra's are interesting, too and worth watching.This is one movie that any young (or old)barbie fan will enjoy many times over."
5,ONE OF THE BEST!,"Both of my kids LOVE this movie(my son[5] & daughter[2]) It has romance & action, castles & dragons. It is so great because the story is a perfect fairytale. I love the way mattel does their own spin on the classics. This one is just as timeless as the original, and you can watch it over & over again without getting bored. The images and the music are both beautiful & magical. I love these movies as much as my kids."
4,different but good,"This is a very different Rapunzel story. Not your average ""Let down your hair"" version. No matter, my daughter still loves it. I think it's pretty cute too."
3,OK Movie for Barbie Fans,"I watched this movie with my little sister and she thought it was good. But I thought that it was just OK (hence the 3-star rating). At the end, it turns into one big soap opera, and I thought they could've used a lot better dialogue. The prince says the famous line 'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!' only once, and it's in Rapunzel's dream, which lasts for only about 10 seconds. But other than those downers, I thought it had a cute message and a whole bunch of cute dresses!!! If you are a big Barbie fan, I recommend this movie because I thought that it was fairly good. The animation it pretty good, and it is a perfect movie for a sleepover!"
4,cute,this is a cute DVD but Barbie in the Nutcracker was better. Mattel stretched the use of a carrer of painting in this story.
5,Please see this video,"I can only say that this is a deeply moral and wonderfully done tale. While I had no expectations at the start, this story is so overwhelmingly joyful and just, that I can only give it the highest recommendation. I purchased the Swan Lake video after seeing it and there is simply no comparision. This is a well written, kind and even noble story for your child.The characters are kind, gentle and polite. Your children need to see this. You may cry when you hear the lullaby. It is something we all wish our children."
5,Great for Little Girls,My 5 year old daughter loves this movie and so do I. The animation is terrific and the story is quite different from the original fairy tale. I liked the story line change and it made for an interesting time. Barbie can make many more movies!
2,"So much was expected, but so little was delivered","Imagine the excitement of my three year old daughter and myself when we found Barbie as Rapunzel. Imagine the anticipation as we put the DVD into the player. It then would be hard to imagine MY disappointment as I tried to sit through the movie. The animation was, as Nutcracker was last year, reminiscent of a computer game. But Rapunzel failed where the Nutcracker sparkled. The story lacked charm and in some cases, rambled. Many of the characters were at best redundant-- the Kelly incarnations which in the Nutcracker were endearing, appeared to be nothing more than marketing tools for the doll in Rapunzel and came across as annoying.If the movie's producers want to see the difference between a cartoon classic and a forgettable piece of animation; they need only look at their entrancing debut film, and their disappointing follow up."
3,CD case was broken,DVD case was broken. DVD won't stay in the case. Product was delivered fast. Good movie quality
3,Good Video,"I did not view this video myself, but I know my 2-year-old daughter was not real interested in it. I know the person that recommened this video to me had older girls (4 & 6). Maybe when my daughter is a little older she would enjoy it better."
2,oh man...,"As a babysitter, I watch many movies that if I wasn't a babysitter, I'd never watch. This is just one of the many ones that my charges love, especially the 3-4 year olds. honestly, I don't like this movie, mostly because I've seen it so much. However, it keeps the girls happy, and yes, I've seen the boys love it too. As a teenager, I'd have to refuse to watch it, but if you do have kids, it's a great movie for them. Just not a great movie for anyone else."
2,Animated Bad Acting...,"As an adult, I absolutely can't stand this movie. It appears to me to be bad acting in animation form. As if they watched a bunch of church-pageant-level players act out the scenes and put them in a cartoon. Perhaps it's the script, which is horrible. If I hear the words ""Mighty Dragon"" again, I think I'll scream!However, my daughters LOVE this movie. I have three girls 4 and under, and it's a commonly requested video at our house. Hence, the two stars I've given it.My advice is if you have children who have already seen this movie, it's probably a must-have. Otherwise, I recommend avoiding this one. If you're looking for a Barbie movie, Swan Lake is better."
1,a disgrace to the original fairy tale,"This movie has nothing to do with the original brothers grimm fairy tale. Although the animation is all pretty and pink, the movie doesn't even come close to the rapunzel story. It was slamming the tale so much, I'm sure the brothers grimm would be turning in their graves by now. If your looking for the real fairy tale try the shelley duvall fairy tale theatres they at least stay true to the original."
5,a great movie about friendship and bravery.,A different little twist on the story of Rapunzel. My children love the Barbie movies and this was no exception.
5,My girls (ages 5+8) just love this movie!,We've watched this over and over and over again. The kids love it. We've grown very fond of the entire Barbie series of movies and recommend them to anyone with young children.
5,Another Barbie Hit!,We purchased this after liking Barbie Nutcracker. My two girls ages 4 and 6 LOVED this movie and have watched it over and over again. Definately recommend this!
3,Doesn't Hold Her Attention,I think this is an ok dvd. It just does not hold my 3 year olds attention. It may be for 4 year olds and up. It is put away in my house for 6 months and then I'll see if she likes it any better. She always gets excited to watch it and then ends up ignoring the movie.
4,Know your phone,"The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says ""Universal 2.5mm Jack"" Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones. Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review. Great product."
1,Not Compatible w/ Sprint Touchpoint 1100,"This product's plug fits in the headset jack of the Sprint Touchpoint 1100 phone, but it disables the phone's keyboard and immediately dials my voicemail as soon as I plug it in to the jack. It also drops any in-progress calls when you plug it in. Frankly, I couldn't figure out how to make or receive calls with the EarBoom plugged into my phone at all. I called Sprint and they said the EarBoom is simply not compatible with the TouchPoint 1100."
2,"Sound quality is bad, takes time to get in ear","After a few months of using this Jabra I've decided to throw it in a drawer and buy a different earpiece. The sound quality, both talking and listening, is significantly worse than my phone without the headseat and significantly worse than my old Nokia earpieces. The incoming sound quality is so bad that I can't use it in the car at highway speeds & noise levels b/c too often I can't understand the other person. Also, although the gel earpiece is comfortable once you put it in, doing so takes too long when trying to answer a call, so I can't leave the earpiece plugged in. So for me, 80% of its usefulness is gone. Some reviewers have raved about the sound and the gel thingy -- I just don't get it."
2,don't bother,I bought this product thinking it would be more comfortable than the nokia ear bud I had previously owned. I was dead wrong. It is very uncomfortable in my ear and I would discourage everyone from buying it.
1,It [stinks]...The sound is muddy...,"What a waste of money...A great idea, but you can't hear from the ear gel. It Seems to block part of the sound, so you have to turn your phone on max to hear anything. I use many different, up-to-date cell phones, and this thing [stinks]. If you buy it you'll be sorry."
2,Person I'm talking to can't hear me,"I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth."
1,Don't order this product,"It would have been nice to actually receive the product I ordered. I figured it's more hassle than it's worth to return it. I've had two of these before and they both broke, but I ordered another one anyway because I liked the way it fit and worked."
1,Poor Quality!!! Don't Buy,"I bought this exact model in a store for 39.99 (sorry, Amazon, should have checked you first) and within 2 days the microphone did not work. Any bumping or re-adjusting of the flexable boom caused the microphone to cut out, which then caused the phone to turn-off the headset jack, disconnecting the call. Overall, very poor quality. Consider looking at other products."
2,"Looks good, but that's it!!!","The Jabra EarBroom has become real popular...I had a plantronics headset with my previous phone, but since I changed phones and needed a headset with a 2.5mm jack I thought I'd try the EarBoom.I travel often and found that the ear peices really didn't fit snug and stay in my ear. When I talk to someone, they can hear much more background noise while I'm driving than you could on my Plantronics headset. The voice quality from the ear peice is okay, but as I mentioned it feels like it's always about to fall out. If you're in a quiet room, the sound quality from my voice mic still isn't very good. I'll be heading to the plantronics site, their quality is good, but the ear pieces fell off of my headset frequently.....at least people could hear me and I could hear them clearly though."
1,Do Not Order For Nokia Phone,"Although it is not indicated in the description, this item is NOT compatible with a Nokia phone. I ordered & received it only to find it was not compatible."
2,Make sure it fits!,"I recently purchased one of these for use with my Sprint Touchpoint 2200. I just cannot find a good fit with any of the eargels provided. After a while they start to hurt and I am currently looking for another headset with a more comfortable earpiece. Also, depending on where I am in the room (or rather, where my phone is pointing) there is a background hum that can get rather loud (especially if the phone is in the recharge cradle). I'm not sure if this is due to the headset, or if it's a problem with my phone. The people I call also complain about a very faint echo if I use the headset. Also, I find the volume in the earpiece way too loud even on the lowest setting on my phone."
2,This thing stinks,"If you're gonna buy an earpiece that's gonna last from Jabra, then the EarSet would be the best one. It works, don't get me wrong, but I would rather just wear one where I can talk into it and not have to worry about having the microphone in the right place and all of that kinda stuff. With the EarBoom, the mic has to be in a certain position and all of this other stuff. That's my opinion, but maybe others take care of things better than I do. Don't buy it if you're destructive like I am. Guilty as charged."
2,"Not comfortable, inconvenient","The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me. It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this. Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert. Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end. I'm not happy with these."
4,It works well!!,Pro- This product works great in the car and on foot. It is pretty good sound quality as well.Con- I have already lost two Jabra Earl gels. They fall off the earset far to easily. They just seem to slip off.Overall- It's worth the price because it so practical with the microphone and speaker in the earset!!
2,Not comfortable and callers complain,"Eargel pieces are VERY tight fitting in the ear. I do have smaller ears so those with smaller ears should be weary. I tried all the gels and none of them don't make my ear hurt after prolonged use. Initially it feels fine when I stuffed it in my ear, but after like 20-30mins of talking, my ear starts to hurt. Another gripe is that my callers complain that I sound distant and they have a hard time hearing what I say. I have to talk pretty loud (no inside voices) which would work fine on the road, but I also try to use it at home with my roommate sleeping so inside voices just don't cut it. Boom is flimsy and overall I regret purchasing this."
2,"great sound, flimsy design","I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress."
1,Works okay . . . if you don't mind shouting.,"This device fits snugly in the ear, and I can hear the party at the other end very clearly. Problem is, others can't hear me unless I shout. Very frustrating! In fact, it's so annoying that I'm returning mine."
3,My experience was positive (mostly),"I find the earpiece comfortable. I suspect that this is a very individual preference. Keep in mind that you can switch ears by replacing the gels but you'll probably never do that.My first earbud broke after a few weeks. Jabra replaced it in a few days with no hassle. They seem to have good customer service and can be contacted via e-mail. The wind cover (you know, the fuzzy thing on the end of the mic?) kept slipping off and I nearly lost it. A drop of glue fixed the problem. I've been using it for over a year and have had no other problems. The audio quality is good even in a convertible with the top down on the interstate."
4,Wonderful book,"I like this book. Not as much as Lonesome dove, but I do love it. I really enjoy historical fiction. McMurtry is able to bring story to his fiction. It gives me a picture of the old west. I like that. As I come to a conclusion of this book, I'm already starting to look for more books of this type."
5,Comanche Moon,"If you have already read Lonesome Dove, then you will understand everything in this book and will enjoy it just as much. If you have not read Lonesome Dove, it would still be a great book, but I feel that Lonesome Dove sets up the characters much better. Highly recommend this book however."
2,A Novel Dissapointment,"LM made a mistake when he wrote Lonesome Dove first,that was a first-class can't put down read.I then found Streets Of Laredo and Dead Man Walking entertaining, but started finding the loose application of history disheartening.Once again, history is a bit distorted in Moon, just a minor example being that this novel must be set somewhere between 1855-1860, yet he keeps refering to Winchester and other repeating rifles, which are still somewhere in the future, after the Civil War which has not happened yet. This may seem like nit picking, but as a fan of the historical novel, I like my fictitional characters to interact with history, not change it, and if one was to make a time line with all four of these novels, I'm quite sure there would be some glaring gaps. I'm sure LM is great at sitting down and telling a story, but I believe that Lonesome Dove just got too big for him, this is a good read, not a great read, which makes it a dissapointment."
2,Not at all as good as others,This book was weak in comparison to Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo. Just not enough action and the narrative is tied too much to characters that aren't as good as those in the other books.
2,Sub-Par,"This book is haunted by being a middle volume. Mr. McMurtry's writing is excellent but the story really goes nowhere. It takes the Lonesome Dove characters and gives them some advevtures for their middle years. Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae are full fledged Captains now. The time spance of the novel is too long and the stories are too disjointed. Characters are introduced and dropped. An example of this is Captain Scull, who is given much time in the first half of the book ( and is quite interesting in a Theodore Roosevelt sort of way) but is reduced to a caricature in the second half. This book was in dire need of some editting. I liked ""Deadman's Walk"" and I loved ""Lonesome Dove"". This book was best summed up by Woodrow Call's las line ""It may be over but it wasn't fun""."
3,Sad end to a great saga,"Like most reviews, I liked the book and was sad the great Gus and Call saga had finally come to an end. Of the four books, this ties with Dead Man's Walk. The best, by far, is Lonesome Dove and then Streets of Laredo. Because of the following these books have generated, I hope McMurtry writes another novel about one of the Lonesome Dove characters."
1,foolishness,A friend thought I would enjoy this book since I enjoy reading so much. I did read it though every time I turned a page I wondered why I bothered.Such foolishness is a disgrace.About the best thing about the book is that no one has to read it.
3,Definitely not McMurty's best...,"If you have not read any of the four-novel ""Lonesome Dove"" series, please do not start with ""Commanche Moon."" Do yourself a favor and read ""Lonesome Dove"" first. It is the best of the series by far, and one of the most entertaining novels I have ever read. Even people who do not usually read westerns will thoroughly enjoy ""Lonesome Dove."" In ""Commanche Moon,"" however, Mr. McMurtry seems to lose focus. It is a collection of storylines which seem to go nowhere. I finished the book feeling as if the storylines had been left incomplete; as if the author had given up in the middle of writing the novel. However, even at his most mediocre, Larry McMurtry is still one of the best authors of our time."
4,"Well written, but not a food as Lonesome Dove","In the last novel in the Lonesome Dove saga, Comanche Moon is interesting, but not quite as fascinating or inspirational as the original. I'd still obviously reccomend it if you read any of the others, because it fills in some gaps and puts a satisfying close to the moving saga that has been praised and admired for years. Overall, a good novel but not the best in the series."
3,Excessive violence,"The book is not bad, but the first half has excessively graphic and unnecessary violence and torture. Hardly necessary. It ruined the book."
2,The book did not meet expectations.,"Most readers of this book have probably already read Lonesome Dove, and thus were expecting the legend of Gus and Call to be filled in. It wasn't. How did Gus and Call become known as the greatest Texas Rangers that ever lived? Beats me. It seems all they did was keep from getting killed and bury the bodies of those who were killed. Maybe that was McMurtry's whole intention--to reveal that Gus and Call were really just a couple of overrated Texans. This explains the scene in Lonesome Dove where Gus and Call went into San Antonio to look for a cook, and noticed that no one remembered them. It turns out there was nothing to remember. I almost wish I hadn't read Comanche Moon, because it deflated my impression of Gus and Call significantly."
3,Larry Mcmurty writes to many books,Not enough action and adventures for Gus and Woodrow. I like the stories about the Comanches. Long live Bufflo Hump sprite.
5,good book,one of our favorite authors and a good read but of course it is in conunction with greatest movie ever made.
5,Excellent,"I could not put this book down. I wish I had known about this book before I had read Lonesome Dove. However, that being sad, I made me go back and read lonesome dove and then the streets of Larado."
4,A Good Read,"Although not as good as the other books in the series, this book is enjoyable to read and does fill in some of the questions about Gus and Woodrow's younger years. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Lonesome Dove series."
1,Nope,"The reviewer: 'A reader from Pittsburgh', hit the nail on the head. He/she notes-""A weary tale...but what's with all the torture (he seems to relish it)..I couldn't wait for it to end which it did finally with out resolving much."" I agree with him\her. It was a depressing book. I'm now reading ""Streets of Laredo"", it's more like ""Lonesome Dove""."
4,A prequel to be read after the sequel...,"The events from the past that are referenced in Lonesome Dove are brought to life beautifully in this prequel, which was, of course, written afterward. Gus McCrae, in my opinion, is one of the 20th century fiction's most humorous, memorable and well-developed characters - and Comanche Moon keeps him out front. He also exposes the more of the makings of Capt. Call just as his crust begins to harden. One of the most outstanding and entertaining characters here is Famous Shoes, the Indian tracker who was introduced in Streets of Laredo. Overall, I found Comanche Moon to be compelling and authentic. It follows closest to the feel and sentiment of Lonesome Dove. My only disappointment was that McMurtry changed the story up some toward the end of the book, creating some inconsistencies where Lonesome Dove picks up. I'm glad I read the latter first."
3,Second Best In Series-Next To Lonesome Dove,"""Comanche Moon"" is the second best of the four books in this series, next to ""Lonesome Dove"", but McMurtry tries too hard to connect all the dots, espeecially in the last 200 pages.The chapters dealing with the Indians are the best in the book, with the exception of Blue Duck's adolescence.Maybe McMurtry should have let ""Lonesome Dove"" stand as a solitary achievement. While I enjoyed reading more about the characters in ""Comanche Moon"", each of the succeeding books in the series seem to lessen the power of ""Lonesome Dove"" as a novel, making it just the best in the series of a set of otherwise average novels."
2,It's not Lonesome Dove,"A weary tale with some interesting character developement (but not much) that seems to fill in some of the questions preceeding Lonesome Dove, but whats with all the torture (he seems to relish it) and story lines that go nowhere?I couldn't wait for it to end which it did finally with out resolving much."
4,Great story - poor research,"Once again, McMurtry is not to be outdone with his representation of the Wild, Wild West. This story is at times implausible, but still a fascinating story. One major complaint is that his story lines do not correlate with other novels. There are many details described in this story that contradict details described in Lonsome Dove. It is frustrating that an author that takes the time to create characters we grow to love, would not take the time to make certain his story line is correct. Still a great read, and a strong recommendation."
2,Weak sequel,Two of the most charming and lovable characthers of Western lore are transformed into a couple of meandering and stumbling saddle tramps in this weak sequel of Lonesome Dove. The premise is absurd. The story is written with a comic book flavor and features a Saturday morning cartoon villian. Where did the inept heroes gain their frontier experience that we read about in Lonesome Dove. Here? In this large comic book? I was not convinced. This story is no good.
5,Ties all the Books Together- Want Miniseries!,"A very good book. The fact that it brings the gap between Lonsome Dove and Dead Mans Walk together is excellent! I always wanted to know the particulars about their adventures before Lonsome Dove, and about Pea Eye, Jake Spoon, And Joushua Deets. I sure hope they decide to make a miniseries out of this book because not to would be a mistake."
4,"Great read, but too many details are wrong","I thought this was a great story. The storys concerning the Comanches were the most compelling to me. I was a little disappointed in the storys regarding the Rangers. They were a little dull in my opinion. After I finished, I was really looking forward to rereading Lonesome Dove, to continue the books in order. However, I have become very annoyed with the little details (well, some not so little)that are not the same from book to book. For example, Jake talks about courting Clara in Lonesome Dove, however she is gone & married in Comanche Moon before he ever would have had a chance. And, in Lonesome Dove, Maggie lived & died there, but in Comanche Moon she lives & dies in Austin. It is distracting to have those kind of discrepencies."
1,McMurty goes slumming; drops Gus and Call into a comic book.,"When Larry McMurty is on, he's really on (witness Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo), but when he's off -- ugh. Comanche Moon is way off. The characters are caricatures, the situations are implausible, the writing is weak and unconvincing. The only possible silver lining: Maybe McMurty will feel a need to redeem himself and invest some effort in a more worthy segment of the series for the readers he cheats with a very dim Moon."
1,Comanche Moon,"My husband couldn't even read it, it was so boring. Gave it away. He was expecting it to be along the lines of Lonesome Dove, but was sorely disappointed."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"ASIDE FROM THE TYPOS, THIS BOOK LEFT ME FEELING EMPTY. DID CALL AND GUS EVER DO ANY GOOD AT ALL 0N THE PLAINS. SEEMS TO ME THEY JUST RAN AROUND IN CIRCLES CHASING INDIANS AND MEXICANS. IN LD U FEEL LIKE THEY ACCOMPLISHED GREAT THINGS IN THEIR YOUTH. THOUGHT THEY WERE TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS TEXAS RANGERS THAT EVER LIVED COMANCHE MOON DIDN'T SUPPORT THIS."
3,Too much time to cover in too small a space.,"I love Gus and Woodrow. They are without a doubt two of my favorite characters of all time. This is why I was somewhat let down by ""Comanche Moon"". True, ""Dead Man's Walk"" was far from a great book but at least it dedicated a whole book to such a small period of time in the lives of two such rich characters. In ""Comanche Moon"", I get the feeling that McMurtry was writing it just to get it out of the way. Now I'm not saying that he should write ONLY books featuring the characters from ""Lonesome Dove"", but come on. In the space of one book, he covered what seemed like ten or fifteen years. How can the readers be expected to grow more attached to the characters if we have to whip through their lives so fast. Whoosh, Maggie is pregnant. Whoosh, Newt's born. Woosh, Maggie dies. I was feeling like I was getting whiplash."
4,"Love the Book, dislike how it was shipped","It keeps me intrigue, wanting to read more!I would have liked it even more, if the book wasnot shipped sticky and dusty."
5,Excellent movie,"This is one of my favorite movies from the sixties and I had not seen it for many years until ordering this DVD. It's a nifty little cat and mouse movie and features an incredibly beautiful Alexandra Stewart. Gene Barry gives another very good performance. While the listing says it's a Region 2 DVD, mine was a Region 0, playable on all machines. The label says ""Region Alle"" (all regions). Very stylish and recommended."
1,Buy this controller if you love to LOSE!,"The controller itself is made of decent quality. The sticks are accurate and recenter themselves well, the analog shoulder buttons have a nice tactile feel, and the buttons are responsive and not mushy. HOWEVER, Logitard was smart enough to put a sleep mode function into the controller. So, if you're playing a game where you switch between keyboard and controller (BF2 for example) and it's been 10 minutes or so since you've used the controller. When you goto use the controller you'll quickly realize that the controller is asleep! What makes it even better is that you have to COMPLETELY exit the game and restart to get the game to recognize the controller. And there's nothing better than have 10 guys yell at you over TS because you have to restart the game in the middle of a match.Go Logitard!"
4,fine for pc a no go for ps3,Well it works on a pc just fine. I plugged this game pad into my ps3 and it was not recognized by the ps3. It may work on an Xbox 360 I am not sure.
2,Works great... if you don't want LT and RT,"So I purchased this controller to replace my old Logitech Dual Action thinking okay its a nice upgrade and the fans will be a nice touch. I was wrong, I'm still using the Logitech Dual Action for the simple reason of I need to be able to use the RT and LT. Those two are only recognized as a Z-Axis control, and its impossible to program them to anything else. Really was a waste. I now have this controller collecting dust, because it will never get used. No point in returning since, by all rights, its not defective. It just doesn't work as I expected it to. My opinion if you don't want a headache DO NOT buy this controller. Get the Playstation style since the R2 and L2 buttons work perfectly on them."
4,Gets the job done,"The cooling fan feature is not really for me but this is a very serviceable gamepad. I have an XBOX 360 and this is a decent imitation of that system's controller. It's much lighter and smaller, so it feels cheaper/shoddier in general than the XBOX 360 controller, but the button layout and dual analogs are close enough to trick my thumbs into thinking I'm using my XBOX. I've only used this to play NBA2K12 on my PC."
4,Nice Idea,The internal cooling fan works well. Usability is unaffected; works just like an Xbox-style controller should.
3,I'd go back to my RumblePad,"I thought it was a new model to replace RumblePad, but it's not. I have no use for the chilling fan, which is quite noisy if turned on (and it will turn itself on every time my computer returns from hibernation). It does not have vibration. It is not supported by Logitech Gaming Software, but you can download the free & powerful Xpadder for button configuration."
3,Interesting,"Tristeza are/was a great band. Spine and Sensory was brilliant, and Dream Signals was rather stunning, yet verging a bit too close to New Age territory. I just have to say that although I own and enjoy A Colores, I think the band lost its edge when Lavalle left. The Album Leaf is boring and uninspired sounding to me. He should have stayed with Tristeza. The loss of his guitar and songwriting skills are very apparent on these newer releases. There is no more ""punch"" like the group had on Spine and Sensory. It's almost as if the band has gone too soft. I do like their album covers, however, very cool."
1,Dissapointing,"I am american military living overseas, and when we pad for the whole season, it would not play. I paid so much money, and got the show, for it not to work. It was a complete waste of money."
5,Sis in law that is hard to buy for,My sister in law loves this show and wanted this for Christmas. She thought it was too expensive and I found it cheaper than any black Friday deal and bought it for her for Christmas. She loved it. It arrived on time and undamaged I was extremely happy because I was racing the Christmas clock!!
4,bought for a gift,Bought for a Christmas gift and they liked this very much. Now they are anxious for season two to buy.
5,The Best Show Ever!,"I love this show! I have watched it through twice and some of my favorite episodes even more. I enjoyed the bonuses like to commentaries, which provide an interesting look it the story and the filming of the show. A very enjoyable show with increidible acting and storyline. My favorite character is Rumplestilskin/ Mr. Gold."
5,Lush imagination and reality mix,This series is the perfect blend of imagination and reality...it gives us the little spark of magic we hope for while not being overly cheesy. I really hope this one keeps going for many seasons!
4,Once upon a time,this was a good investment for me. Me and my family all loved this and I just had to get it. My older sister would never watch them. She thought they were dumb until one day I told her to just try one episode and she has been hooked since. I really liked the first season but I like the second season much better. I will most likely get the second season as it becomes avaliable.
5,I love this show!,"When I first started watching, I was worried that this may be some really corny, made for kids only, type series. In later episodes I have found myself completely drawn in and love the show! The character growth and development is amazing. I love learning about Rumpelstiltskin and watching how he had his hands in everyone's business. His character is quite intriguing and so is the whole show. I am adding this to the list of my favorite TV series. I don't really have many of those because I don't watch TV that much unless it really catches my interest."
5,once upon a time,ONE OF THE MOST INTRESTING SHOWS OUT THERE TO WATCH AS GOOD AS LOST I LIKE ALL THE TWISTS AND INTERACTION OF THE CHARACTERS THIS AND WAREHOUSE 13 ARE ABOUT THE ONLY SHOWS I WATCH
5,LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!,THIS IS A CLASSIC SHOW!!! NOTHING LIKE IT! I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH SEASON 2 IN ITS ENTIRETY!!! THE STORY LINE IS SO INTRIGUING! IT KEEPS ME WANTING MORE!!!
4,Once Upon a Time-Unique show that will not be for everyone,I enjoy the show but it's premise will not be for everyone. The season finale is not available yet and unfortunately I missed it. Hopefully it will become available soon or the big build up will be a big letdown. It has creative storylines that have a familiarity which sometimes tantalizingly sends you in an unexpected direction. Hope to look at the season finale without having to buy the whole season. Think this is a show well worth viewing.
5,Love this series!,My daughter and I had a lot of fun getting up to speed with this series before the second series started - so glad we found this!!!
5,great show,"great spin , and wonderful how they make all the fairy tales intertwined. Must see tv for our household. bravo"
4,Once upon a time,The picture quality was good however I feel the prices should be cut in half for tv episodes. I have also watched a couple other programs and have not had any issues while viewing them. I also feel it would be nice if they could set up a program like netflix for unlimited viewing.
1,Nope!,"I really thought I would like this one, but its not for me. Not a good cast, and not very good acting. I think the writing was poorly done."
5,Innovative New Show,"This is one of two shows this season which is innovative, interesting, and just plain fun to watch (the other being Grimm). If you want production companies to invest in new, interesting, innovative, and well-written shows for television, then you need to give this show a chance."
3,Weak Opening But Has Potential,"Despite its weak opening sequence, which begins with the obligatory text-on-screen storytelling, and the jarring jumps between past and present, Once Upon A Time definitely has the potential to be something unique and entertaining...but only if the creators (and editors) are willing to do some work. The storyline, which I admit to being intrigued by initially, only began to become engaging towards the end, with the rest of the episode feeling like a filler that could have easily been used in other episodes to build up the tension and intrigue. As it stood, I found some of the back-and-forth a little silly and over done, with not enough time given to either the past or present to really become attached to any of the characters. While I do plan to continue to watch, I can only hope that this first episode will be the weakest of the lot."
5,It casts a spell...,I love this show! As a bookworm I don't watch TV as much as other people my age but this show is a major exception for me. I've always loved fairy tale retellings so when I saw a preview for the show while at the movies last summer I was so happy to see that something so unique was coming to TV. I love it when they take the stories that we think we know and turn them on their head. I especially applaud the creativity that went into the Little Red Riding Hood retelling. I also love the fact that Snow is lively and has a backbone and a mind of her own in this show which she tends to lack even in the many modern retellings I've read. I also love the little actor who plays Henry that kid knows his stuff.
5,Love it!,The characters tie in smoothly and the writers do a good job of adjusting to fit the model - such as Rumplestiltskin filling the role of 'The Beast'. Looking forward to next season - well done!
2,Didn't Like!!,"After watching season 1 of ""Once Upon a Time"" I realize one thing for sure, I didn't like it. But I wanted too. I kept waiting for something to happen, something, anything that would give a spark to the show. The only characters that were interesting were the Queen and Rumpelstiltken. Don't get me wrong, I like the concept of Fairy tale characters living in modern times; which is why I kept watching, (though I fast forward the last three episodes) but the writing did nothing that would make me want to watch this show again."
3,Buy it at the store.,"Case came broken, found it cheaper at the local best buy for $10 bucks cheaper. The product works, distributor must have bought the extra broken cases for cheaper."
3,Watching & Waiting,Not bad - so far. Under the same genre as another show (Grimm) - fairytales intertwined with present day - but not as gory. Doesn't list which network the show is under. I am waiting for the next episode to give a better rating.
2,Network-Style Writing Turned Me Off,"I was happy until episode five when the searchers learned a boy was in a mine because they found a candy bar he had dropped. (Note to network writers: boys don't loose whole candy bars out of a backpack; these things are important to them.) This contempt for the audience is what makes network shows second rate compared to, say, HBO."
2,Snoozer,"Story premise could have been interesting but it progressed too slowly due to an effort to tie together every fairy tale anyone might have ever heard of in their childhood. Special effects, makeup and costuming were too extreme."
5,Awesome show,This is an excellent show that can be re-watched without being boring.I bought the DVD season for my sister and she loves it.
5,amazing,"amazing. once upon a time is the best show in the whole entire world. all hands down, all thumbs up."
5,Get this if you love the show and have a blu-ray player!,"Wonderful and magical--and the best way to see season one of your favorite fairytale land show. It is quite Charming, Dearies!"
5,LOVE IT BEST EVER,The more I see the more I'm drawn into the story lines of Once Upon a Time...... soo many twists and turns in the plot keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more and it only gets better ...... LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great show,Excellent show and nicely compacted disc set. If you like any type of fantasy shows you'll love this one. The one downfall is it can get a little soap-opera-y when the actors get a little too dramatic.
4,Good Series,"Very Imaginative. Brings the Snow White tale to modern day cleverly. Enjoyable, creative, fresh, bright and entertaining. If you liek fairy tales younwill like this!"
5,Once Upon a Time; First Season,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift, and it appears to be in excellent condition. I only hope that the quality of the CD's are as good as they look!"
5,Excellent series for kids,My kid really enjoy it. It is a very good series and very well produced. We will buy the second season for sure.
5,Bloody Good,"I watch season 1 on telly but found it was boring, even though I did enjoy the show. So when season 1 came out I bought it and watched it in 3 days so enjoyed it when you don't have any adds to miss. Watched season 2 opening and some thing don't make any sense at all from the end of season 1."
5,The best TV show ever!,"This series is the best. Good storyline, good acting and overall a great adventure. Excellent for kids but small ones may need some help with the villans. Wonderful and creative story telling."
3,"Not hooked on the series, but very interesting anyway",I like the way the fairy tale characters are connected. Keeps you thinking. Not sure I'll watch the series but a couple were pretty good shows.
5,enjoyable!,I had this series recommended to me and decided to take the plunge. I enjoyed every episode! There are lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing what is going to happen next!
4,Good TV show,Show is surprisingly well written and acted for a network series. I was surprised by the quality of this ABC show.
5,Amazing and Entertaining Show,Very few TV shows worth watching today. After I watched the Pilot I couldn't stop and had watched the entire season in about two days. Great twist on all of our favorite storybook characters.
5,A big surprise!,I'm always looking for time passing DVDs to fill in on snowy winter days. This set was a pleasing surprise. Fairy tales set in todays world. How would that come about you say? It's good story line with good vs evil without getting preachy. Every fairy tale you can think of has a great spin for the modern day viewer. Even my big he-man son liked the stories. We are looking forward to season two.
5,Fairy Tales,This is a very good series that incorporates many fairy tale chacters. Each week a new character shows up in the story.
5,Received it 3 days later,"wow. I just ordered it and about 3 days later came in, brand new and in the package. Love it!"
3,Twisted Fairy Tales,"I sort of wanted to see little inserts of the most popular fairy tales. Those that were introduced in my younger days. It grabbed my attention for awhile .... then the famous ""cat & dog"" chase started and my preconception kicked in...that it's going to be one of those that can be predicted before it ends. The positive side...it had a little of everything in it...such as evil villain, and person who believes and never gives up."
5,Once Upon a Time,I was excited to get this series. I watched it all in a day or two. One of my disks had a small issue but nothing I can't live with. Shipping was fast.
1,Don't bother,"The book is an easy read, which is the only positive thing about it. But don't bother. The book never describes why children are the better day traders other than stating in the last sentence they would be. The German born author spends more time ranting about American politics than describing his trading philosophy - which is buy a basket of stocks in the day's hot sector rather than picking only one (this is related to hopscotch somehow). However, in the last chapter he states futures are better for day trading than stocks but does not go into any more detail."
5,My health,"These are great! i have many health issues that bring down my imune system, these lozenges have helped me ward off colds and even the flue.I take one a day or if it's flue season i take a few a day.I recommend them as they work for me."
1,"Dr. Peters does not live in the real world of parents, teachers and kids.","If only it were this simple...every child would be a A student! First of all, if your child does not want to do the homework, they are going to conveniently ""forget"" about assignments. As far as communicating with the teachers about assignments, that will last a few days, then the annoyed teacher gives a lecture about ""teaching your child to be responsible"" (in other words, I don't have time to make sure your kid writes down the assignment every day for the whole year). The punishment/reward system does not work for a child who looks at homework as the punishment. This book contains the simplistic advice you would find in any woman's magazine. It will not work, especially with older children."
4,Overcoming underachieving,Very enlightening and informative. Gave me some new strategies on myself and my children. I would highly recommend this book to any parent who feels their child is not meeting their goals academically or personally. A good read.
2,Malfunctions often,"The first day I used it, I kept getting inconsistent readings. I had either 27% or 5% body fat, I'm not sure which. I knew I wasn't at 5% for sure, since I'm not a world class athlete and do have some fat on me from a lack of physical activity since having 3 kids, so I figured that 27% had to be accurate. But then it started acting weird and shutting off by itself while I was using it or losing the memory, so I put in a new battery. It seemed to be more consistent after that with readings in the range of 27%, but then the malfunctioning happened again the next day. I can't say if the readings were ever accurate, since I had nothing to compare it to, but the malfunctioning made it a definite return to the store."
1,Save your money,"Indeed, this device is very attractive from a visual aspect. However, I will attest to the fact that it will give you an accurate reading to within .1% of someone's body fat. Tanita body fat scale shows me at 21.7%, this product reports me at 29.7%.I wanted to report no stars, but the product review won't accept it."
1,don't waste your time,"I bought this body fat analyzer from target after having my body fat professionally measured. No matter what I did, it always read my body fat to be 30.5%. Now, I'm no kate moss, but I'm not at 30% either! I even tried it on my overweight boyfriend and his size 0 sister, and surprise! They too both had 30% body fat! Don't waste your time buying this one, you'll jsut be returning it shortly."
1,one star is too many,"When I bought mine it showed I was 50% fat. I'm overweight, I accepted this. After working out for 4 months doing both cardio and weights, along with losing inches I tried it again. I'm still 50% fat.My boyfriend who is overweight but has a physical job measured at 5% body fat. Even with a gut gain of weight he's still 5%. We'll see what the omron one I just purchased tells me, but it's got to be better!"
1,"Unsure what it measures, but body fat isn't one of them","Granted this product is convenient and cheap, but that doesn't offset it rendering data that is misleading and potentially dangerous. I am 6ft, 175Ibs have a 33"" waist (around the belly button), workout 4 times a week (running/weights) and this little device consistently tells me I have 28% body fat. It's saying that of my 175Ib frame about 45Ibs of it is pure fat. Absolutely ridiculous! I'm actually much closer to 15% body fat based on more accurate devices. I mentioned ""dangerous"" in the first sentence because some might actually believe the numbers rendered and go on crash diets or meal/supplement plans.In my opinion, this product is not worth the $20 I spent and I do not recommend it. Wish I could find the receipt so that I could return it."
2,Waste of money - Not accurate,I bought this for its sleek design and easy to read but it shows different readings even taken 1 minute apart
3,Works for me,Comparison of this device to calipers and calculations based on body measurements gave results within +/- 3%. The user must be hydrated for these devices to work properly. They rely on the water content to measure the percentage of body fat.
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried two different units and with both the body fat analyzer inaccurately measured my body fat giving a considerably lower reading than the reading I had received on the computerized YMCA body fat analyzer only days before. I returned both. As always, Amazon.com provided excellent customer service and I had no problems or hassles returning the units either time."
1,"Completely worthless, get calipers instead.","This thing is plain wrong. Seriously wrong. Apparently, if you have any muscle mass on you, it doesn't work. I'm five foot seven, one hundred forty pounds. I work out somewhat, and have about maybe 10 to 15 pounds max of extra lean muscle mass compared to someone of a similar build who doesn't lift weights. A good amount muscle, yes, but no one will every confuse me with a body builder or professional athlete. Measured by trainers at the gym with fat calipers, I'm about 12-13% body fat.This machine gives me around 21-22% body fat. This is wrong, by the simple fact that the more accurate fat calipers are almost 50% lower, and by the fact that I can still fit in my size 28 jeans.What's worse is the lack of consistency. In the morning, my body fat will 21.7%, and by night, it will be 21.3%, making it completely useless even for measuring change.This is product is laughable and should be avoided."
3,not that bad really.....,"I didn't expect this to be like a body fat scale or something that I can get done at my gym, not for the price that it is. but it is what it is....it gives me a quick calculation to my percents and that is great with me. it does not compare to other readings that are probably more accurate, but it is compact and easy to use."
3,"Excellent quality, but uncomfortable","The plastic is of a very high quality (made in France), and should last FAR longer than the typical plastic claw clips I have purchased in the past. The downside, however, is that the tips of the claws are VERY sharp, and don't come together completely flat against your head, so that they continually push sharply against the scalp. I give this item five stars for quality, but only one star for comfort."
5,Wonderful Willa,Here is the wonder-filled tale of a girl with the nerve and persistence to confront the north wind . Though the mischievous wind is honest in his dealing the innkeeper she meets is not. Willa meets the challenge with pluck and spirit. My daughters can't get enough of this new hero !
2,headache galore,"this is just not for me, just too strong for me , give me a horrible headache and burn my nose terribly,just nauseated,i just don't like, will be giving this away to some who a appreciate it a little more cause i don't, would have been nice if it was a little toned down, only way i wear this i one little squirt, that's it,because it does have a nice sent to,"
1,IT'S A FAKE!!!!!!!!,I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE MY ORDER WAS HERE SO FAST....BUT ITS NOT THE REAL DEAL...IT SMELLS LIKE CRAP.SO DISAPPOINTING.I EVEN WAITED A COUPLE HOURS AND HAD A FRIEND SMELL IT WHO OWNS THIS. ITS A FAKE
2,Not so good,"Este perfume a pesar de llamarse ""Just Me"" y efectivamente ser de Paris Hilton, le han cambiado el aroma. Tiene un aroma agradable, pero es completamente diferente al mismo perfume comprado hace apenas unos meses en tiendas en USA. El aroma anterior era mucho más agradable que el actual. No compraría otro."
5,Smells great !!!,I bought this perfume for my wife as a gift for Christmas. She loved it. the price was a great bargain.
3,"Is It Really ""Just Me""?","Or does this perfume smell like mouthwash? Somebody actually gave this to me for my birthday. I couldn't believe it. Anyway, mouthwash doesn't smell bad, but still. I was expecting maybe a light floral scent. I'll probably give this away to one of my younger cousins."
5,"Ew, I'm sorry, but could the description for that be any worse.","Celebrity....Trend Setter (as if).....Model.....Beauty......Star. BARF. I know no one will find this ""helpful"", but it is, if you're deluded about Paris Hilton."
2,BLAH,"I rated this product with 2 stars because I just don't like it. I don't HATE it, and it doesn't repluse me, but I will never wear it again because it just doesn't smell nice. After buying her other two perfumes (the Paris Hilton Women original one, and Can Can) and loving those SO much (they're very sexy and girly), I decided to buy this ""Just Me"" one because I thought I'd love it just as much...but no. I'm usually drawn to sexy/sweet/girly perfumes. For example, a couple of my faves are Britney Spears - Fantasy, Ralph Lauren - Hot, Beyonce - Heat, Victoria's Secret - Sexy Little Things Noir, and the other Paris Hilton ones I previously mentioned. So, my advice to you: save yourself the disappointment and go buy one of those... Clearly, by the reviews, some people actually like this, so if you're willing to try it, I'd go with a smaller bottle so you can test it out."
1,Thumbs down,"I actually like the other perfume(s) she has out, but this one is far too strong.......I gave it away....Very disappointed with the smell!"
4,Just what I needed,"It takes a lot to get me standing in front of the tv, jumpingaround like an idiot, to tighten up my pudgy belly. Richard Simonds,Denise Austin, forget it. So how did this program pry me off therecliner? The arobics ladies are buck naked. That's good enough forme. When they say stretch down, I do it. When they say reach for thesky, my arms jump. If Nude Cardiovascular Workout is what it takes tolower my blood preasure, cholesterol, weight, stress, etc, then Igladly submit. A few minutes, five days a week here in my living roomwith my new instructors. If this exercise class of nude ladies can'traise my heart rate, I don't know what else possably could. 1-2-3-4,1-2-3-4."
2,"not terrible, but terribly overrated","This book is a collection of many separate articles on Heidegger, apparently slapped together under one cover due to the usual academic pressures to publish books. Bernasconi uses a refreshingly direct style, free of preciousness (unlike his colleagues John Sallis and David Krell). For this he deserves our thanks. Unfortunately, the book itself does little to justify Bernasconi's reputation as one of the big guns in contemporary Heidegger studies. Most disappointing is the unconvincing chapter linking Being and Time to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, notable for sloppy argumentation and faux classical erudition."
1,Never Recieved Item Bought,"The seller supposedly ""shipped"" the item about four days after it was purchased. The item never arrived. It has been almost a month, and the seller refuses to send tracking information or an estimated time of arrival for a reshipment."
4,A useful touring map,"Before I start, I should say that there isn't yet a good road map for Thailand. There are only a few map books available and none of them really had the detail that I wanted. Having said that, this is the best of the bunch and I use it every time I drive out of Bangkok. A few of the tourist attractions were wrongly located but at the end of the day I have to admit it didn't get me lost. In fact, after my map book got drenched when my hotel was flooded in Sukhothai I just went out and bought another copy of the same book."
1,Took my money and never delivered the book!,"To rate the actual item, it cannot be done because I never received it. It was ordered over a month ago and they wont even respond."
4,"Beautiful, yet Montrose forgot to mention...","Altough ""Dogtionary"" is a beautifully, artfully, photographed book, Ms. Montrose neglected to acknowledge world renowned photographer Keith Carter who's work and obvious inspiration, especially that of the book ""bones"", majorly contributed to Montrose's photographic style, direction and content. As for Keith Carter, for whom Montrose so eloquently ripped off in making her photographic book Dogtionary, the exceptionally timeless book ""Bones"" by Keith Carter is certainly worth having if you're so inclined to come across it."
3,Enjoyable CD overshadowed by the notable omissions,"I actually like this CD, I like how eclectic it is. It has something for every mood. However, my dissappointment about the omission of particular songs takes away my complete enjoyment. I couldn't believe they left out the signature song Numb by linkin park and Jay-z. That song played in the beginning and every trailer, amping the movie and setting the tone for the whole thing. I got excited every time I heard it, and then they leave it out! What's up with that? And, yeah during the movie I heard Chris Cornell twice and thought cool, never heard those songs can't wait for the soundtrack. Those songs, in addition to all the cool techno-electronica re-mixes, the great salsa song playing when they were in Cuba, and the love song by India Arie is what got me to buy it. The CD did not live up to its' potential for greatness. Had it had all the notable songs it would've been a definate 5 stars."
2,Sadly Disappointing,"Just saw the movie last night. I love most of Mann's movies, especially because of the way he layers in awesome music. If you saw Heat, you remember how the music was great and set the mood of the scenes just right. This time around, there is something missing. The songs I liked the best were 2 new songs I heard from audioslave (another reviewer mentioned this), but they aren't even on the soundtrack! Same with the Jay-z opening track. To top it all off, the electronica mixes/covers of Nina Simone's Sinner Man and Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight were just weak. Try the originals of those songs and you'll see what I mean. Those would have rocked. I keep waiting for another soundtrack like Heat. Collateral didn't have it (only a few good songs there) and neither does this. Sigh."
3,Good soundtrack but where are the Chris Cornell songs??,"I think the music on this soundtrack is great, but it is incomplete. While watching the movie you hear several, I believe to be, Chris Cornell songs. Says his name in the music credits. It maybe Audioslave, but I think it is him. If anybody knows, feel free to share. I hate it when I dig a song from a movie, and its not on the soundtrack."
3,nice mix of songs and score but where is the trailer's song?,"this soundtrack is a definite improvement over 'collateral'. however, it still pales in comparison with other michael mann's classics such as 'the last of the mohicans' or 'the insider' or the ultra-excellent 'heat'.but one thing though, where is the song that was used in the movie trailer? the same song was also used in the opening sequence at the discotheque. can anyone tell me what that song is and where i can find it? thank you."
1,Nü Metal Makes Me Sick,"Leave it to Nü Metal to take one of the greatest songs ever, Phil Collins' ""In The Air Tonight"" and turn it into utter trash.I'm revolted.The rest of the soundtrack is okay, but it hurts-- no kills-- to hear such an assinine crass cover of an absolutely brilliant song.Ick."
2,Miami Vice Soundtrack,"Not as much music as I envisioned from the movie. May be I am not being totally accurate, but I don't recall many of the soundtrack titles being in the movie. There are about three songs that I favor from the soundtrack."
3,Some very good songs and some not so good,"While I thought the actual movie tried too hard to come off as moody and stylish without succeeding there were a few songs that were intriguing. I particular liked Patti Labelle's voice on the meaningless lyrics of ""One of These Mornings"". Once I actually listened to the words I had to laugh. Three sentences repeated over and over but only Patti could make that work. I also enjoyed Emilio Estefan's song and a few others. A lot of soundtracks can stand on their own for musical interest but not this one. You really do need the movie for some and others are just not interesting movie or no movie."
4,Good Soundtrack,I thought they picked out a great list of songs for the movie. The songs created a mood I thought matched Miami Vice. I particularly enjoyed the mix of the Nina Simone song.
4,Liberation Came,"A story of people-smugglers turning their victims into sexual slaves and pity crime executioners, depicting Trans-Carpathians Gypsy boy and sister-in-law of him lured with the better opportunities to and then repeatedly abused in West Berlin.A nave tale of FRG pre-unification time, when the East-European boarders were sealed even much tighter than recently, staged brilliantly by young actors, precedes a liberation time of the ninetieth famous for industrialised en masse supply of region-originated sex-slaves for catering the West-pervert tastes [...]."
4,Pachamama,"The Inca culture is a very great sourece for the human being. But until now we do not know it very much. We need more and more information to know the true Inca. How ? The Inca is not only the Inca trail or the Machu Picchu, nor the stone only, The trational food, the music, the festive, their language (not the Spanish) ,all of those are the true Inca culture. But we do not see any one investigate it. What is pachamama? It mean the origin of the earth,the source of the earth,the mother of the earth. Where is the Inca now? We need to know the reeason why it disappeared. Maybe the answers will save our future."
1,Simply ... dreadful,"I've owned three of these bad boys in the last six months. The serious design flaws aren't simply manufacturing errors. The most common problem, the earpiece unit comes apart quite easily. This generally causes the unit to break entirely as the wires disconnect from the earphone.Most commonly, I've had complaints from callers that the headset makes me inaudible or fuzzy sounding.I've switched to a different brand. I liked the Jabra ear gels, which I found comfortable. However, the shortcomings in the quality of the headset makes this a choice of which to be wary."
2,almost useless in a car,"This is a nice little device when I used it at home, when i was not moving around and in a quiet environment. However, in a car, moving at any speed above 30mph, the quality stunk. First, the sound I hear in the earpiece is very tunneled, like the other person is speaking way to close to the phone, and there's a lot of background noise all of a sudden. But that isn't tooo bad. The worst part is that the person on the other end has a hard time hearing me. They tell me it's like i have all of my windows open (which I didn't). I know it's not the reception of the phone because I'd unplug the earbud and talk fine w/ the normal phone.One other thing that annoyed me, is that if i have it plugged into the phone (Startac, w/ Sprint PCS), when someone calls it only rings into the earpiece, so I can't tell if someone calls unless I have the earpiece in all the time, OR I plug it in after someone calls - not very convenient when on the road."
1,Breaks easily,I used the earbud for about six months and the gel cover constantly came off and was lost in my briefcase. It finally split in two and the earphone disconnected from the unit. They are really fragile so plan on replacing them frequently.
1,Terrible Product,I just bought this product and have used it for 1/2 hour and am returning it. The quality is HORRIBLE. People sound garbled and they said I sounded garble. It was as if I was talking through a gauze sheet with lots of static. I do not recommend this item at all.
1,Don't buy it,"The ear gel works OK. It helps with staying in the ear and with shielding out some noise. The microphone is awful, though, rendering the device useless. Cuts out, sounds bad, just don't buy it."
3,comfy,"These earbuds were comfortable to wear unless you have small ears like myself or you have been wearing them for an extended period of time such as 4hours. They come in different sizes, which the smallest one is still too large for mine. So, if you have avg size ears or larger, then they are good."
2,Not a good headset,"I have owned this product for about a year now and half of the time I get complaints that I sound far away or that people can't hear me. I'm going to buy a new one, try to avoid this product."
5,The stars and a dose of misery,"Here's a book that proves again that there's nothing like the boundlessness of the cosmos to snap one's problems into perspective. The Year of the Comets proceeds on two tracks. In the aftermath of his mother's death, Deblieu's husband, Jeff, settles into a deep depression. Simultaneously, Deblieu takes up stargazing, with a study of the two comets that crossed Earth's path that year. The neatly balanced result is this book, which is a compassionate look at what happens when the disease of depression enters your home, and a lovely description of the solace that a contemplation of the heavens can provide. The writing here is moving and informative on both fronts."
2,Forensic Psychology,"Some chapters were too long. I did not find this book interesting, as a matter of fact it was rather dull and boring!"
1,The description of the book was a lie,"I ordered this book because it was suppose to be in new condition.When I received the book it had writing in it,(I hate books with writing in it) the back of the book is very sticky from stickers being removed, and the book clearly says used so she tried to cover up the fact that she already purchased the book used so she removed the stickers,but, it was stamped on the pages.I was stuck with the book because my class had started so I had to settle with it. I will never order from this person again."
2,"Fair introductory text, but disappointed by lack of depth","I am an attorney for a psychiatric hospital and purchased this text, which was the primary required textbook in a graduate level Psychology and Law class that I took last Fall. The book served its purpose as a very general, basic introduction to the field, but if you are looking for a reference text, as I had hoped this would be, this book will likely fail to meet your needs. I found the bibliographic references to primary sources in the literature to be the best part of the book; without that, I probably would have given the text one (1) star."
4,I like this book.,"I like this book. It is filled with a lot of interesting information about how the U.S. justice system uses psychology and psychologists. It also clearly defines what a forensic psychologist is. I am a fourth year psychology major and have read many psychology books about a variety of psychological subjects, and this book is one of the most intresting I have read in a while. The only thing I do not like about it is that it has no glossary of the bold words, only a subject and name index. This makes it a little difficult to completely understand what the vocabulary words mean especially since many of them are legal terms."
2,Forensic Psychology,This book is dry and far less interesting than I hoped it would be. I find myself rereading passages over and over because they are so dull that my mind wanders non-stop. It is comprised of far too many legal cases and too few studies on the brain.
4,Learning what contentment is all about,"Set mainly in Montana between 1905-41, Pam Lacey, a headstrong ranch girl, sets her sights on ""bigger things"" and mistakenly marries a rich boy from the East. It's a case of the grass not always being greener on the other side, and, swallowing her pride, she leaves her husband and returns home to Montana. She takes over her father's ranch and, to make money, turns it into a dude ranch (a new fangled idea at the time, and one which infuriates the old ranch hands). She ends up living a pretty lonely existence, especially in the winters when the ""dudes"" are all gone, but she also learns to be content. Although some of the novel is fairly predictable, Walker writes lovingly of the challenges of Montana ranch life (especially for a single woman) and the deep satisfactions that come with it."
1,The worst album of the year? I think so.,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this! After being recommended the album on a popular Radiohead forum, I thought I would give it a go. I regret even searching Amazon for it now. From start to finish, this album did nothing but hurt my ears. Jittery beats and piercing screams echo about all over the place and there are absolutely no melodies or music to speak of. Basically, it's just screaming. Looped screaming, distorted screaming, echoed screaming. Every type of screaming you could imagine. And it isn't even backed by music! Just the same jittery beat looped over and over. Tick tick tick. Over and over and over again. I thought my brain was going to explode after a few seconds of this tripe.Be VERY wary of the artist's description. It's NOTHING like you think it's going to be.p.s. I am NOT 'Come Louder'."
4,Fourth Best Magic Tree House Book,It was so good. I read it in the car even though I was worried about being car sick. Polar Bears Past Bedtime is one of my favorite Magic Tree House books because Jack and Annie were trapped on the ice. It must have been scary for them.
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I chooses this book as awesome because I love polar bears and plus I love to learnBy one of your most fan May
4,This book is cool! and cold!,"Jack and Annie went to the Artic wearing only their bathing suits. Luckily, a guy helped and gave them warm clothes. He also helped them get back to the tree house after they solved the mystery. - Kyle (age 6)"
4,Has both positive and negative examples.,"I don't know why, but I didn't enjoy reading this book. It didn't seem right. I guess I'm not a big fan of marketing. However, concepts were explained quite well and overall it was informative. Unlike many business related books this one did have negative examples, complete with explanations what, how, and why something went wrong. For that I rate it at 4 stars."
2,Dry and boring.,"I realize this is a textbook, and as such, I didn't expect it to be scintilating. This text, however, did not even meet up to my limited expectations- the chapters are way too long and attempt to cover too much material. It would have been useful if the authors attempted to break up the material into smaller, more digestible bits. All in all, this book is extremely dry."
1,Good for first time servers in a very informal servers.,"This book is good for someone who is brand new to the server industry, however not good for someone who is presently working as a server and wishes to sharpen their skills. I felt that the author really did not have the years of experience necessary to write a serious book about serving and etiquette. The section about ""Turning your tables--tricks to get people to leave your station"" is ridiculous. Not one of these suggestions could be utilized in any restaurant without being considered a rude, inexperienced server. All in all, I would not recommend this book to someone who takes their job seriously in this business."
5,"A Great ""Tip"" for any Reader","I bought this book out of curiosity and found it to be quite interesting. Sword definitely knows the ""ins and outs"" and gives great advice on dealing with every person in the restaurant successfully. Her tips for a successful employment can be used in any industry. You'll really enjoy her candor and humorous honesty as she guides even the novice through tricky customer relations. A very enjoyable read for anyone!"
1,The other five star people MUST be her friends or relatives.,"Although this book has some good points in it, for the most part it really is not a serious book on this subject, and many of her points are just plain questionable. All those other people giving her 5 stars must be her friends.There are much better books out there."
1,Save your money!,"This book is horrendous. No one that actually takes their job seriously would actually do any of the things suggested in here. It is most definately a book for someone that works in a restaurant where they wear shorts, thousands of pins on their suspenders, and stand around gossiping. Take it from me, there about one hundred other books on service which are actually serious and well worth the money."
2,Not the Best Snack,"I bought these snack treats for my poodle. However, she didn't like them too much. I don't know if other dogs might like them. My dog is usually not very picky when it comes to food so your dog might like them."
1,worried,"I was very concerned when I rec'd this product. it was made in China, and a number of the ""sticks"" were broken with grayish brown sediment around them. They had a terrible smell. My dog took one sniff and walked away (she usually eats any ""treat"" I give her). I think this product should be taken off of the Amazon sales site. I usually like to shop for products at Amazon. Now I am leery to do so."
5,Dingo Stix,"My dog loves these stix, she takes it and then runs as fast as she can back to her bed to enjoy at her leisure"
5,Dingo products are excellent,"I had previously purchased Dingo mini rawhide bones for my parents Siberian Husky and Shar Pei and those two ate those bones without any hesitation. With this knowledge, I thought that I would try these Munchy Stix for our Yorkshire Terrier for Christmas. At the time, Amazon had these for a ridiculously low price and I purchased way more than was needed to fill her stocking. She ate these up like there was no tomorrow and they leave little to no crumbs afterwards. I do not know what else I can say about these, as I can not comment on their flavor or texture, but our puppy loves them."
5,Doggie Liked Them,"Dog ate them and seemed to like them. So, if the dog liked them, I guess they were OK. :)"
4,Old stand by that Briley still loves!,"We've bought these for years and Briley always enjoys them, so much so that she knows what the word ""Dingo"" means. Dingo = Treat Time for Briley"
4,hot kool stuff!,"kool keith is one of the most imaginative, smothest, nastyest, and creative mc's around. on this album he takes his lyrics and sounds to the edge making u get addicted to his voice and lyrics. fat words and dope music like 'sex style', 'sly we fly', 'make up your mind', and many more, can be heard over and over again. the pruduction by kut masta kert and many others is just great. if u don't have it - get it now!"
5,Kool Keith's best,"Kool Keith is my favorite rapper, and this is my favorite of all of his albums. While many rappers have penned sex rhymes, few have dedicated an album to the theme. Keith demonstrates a fantastic, fanatical dedication to 'the booty world' and straight up pimpin' fantasy. Keith's rhymes range from simple and straightforward smut to mind-bending, playful word games.From its twisted opening lines to its deadpan finish, KutMaster Kurt's bassed-out beats and Keith's nasty assonance will keep you bouncing."
4,He's The Illest,"The cat has been underated since he was a breakdancer in the early 80's. The beats are more raw than his Dr. Octagon releases. The lyrics are the illest ""Make up your mind, who you want to pump the butt?"" A must-have for any fan of The Ultramagnetic MC's or Kool Keith."
5,DAYUMMM! why can't I find more stuff from this NUT?,"I have been listening to hip hop ever scenes HIP HOP started and what goes unnoticed is that this dude was down with KRS1 and Scott La Rock long before Criminal Minded was released. He gets no props in the East Sides of any hoods USA, but the skaters and snowboarders come in flocks to see him perform. And who the hell is the other character rappin on ""Sly We Fly""? he sounds like a Kool Keith alter ego, but sounds like no Keith I have heard. The beats are bangin and again, the producer goes unnoticed. It seems that all the good stuff is hard to get a hold of. If anyone can hook a brother up, let me know. I want a copy of this Masters of Illusions song they have been playing on the Worlds Famous (Sellout) Wake Up Show. Only problem is, that's all that's out there to listen to for the latest ishnit. PEACE"
2,Needed more info on PC version of game,"I bought this for use with the PC version of the game but the guide focuses on the xbox etc. not PC. As a result, it has not been much use yet.I am sure it is useful for xbox etc. but not much use for PC.Disappointed."
4,Even though I'm not a parent,I really thought this book was fun. Well worth it. You can relate so well just from the things you see every day! Hope there's more to come from this writer.
1,Talk about confusing,"If you want to make the expense report process twice as difficult as it needs to be, then this is the product for you. I would send mine back if they actually accepted returns. No wonder there is no demo!"
1,How can I review this product...I haven't received it yet?,"Hello? Anyone awake in Amazon land? I have not received the tape you want me to review...it is on ""back order"". So far ""back order"" from Amazon seems to mean...you just ain't gettin' it...so sorry. LOL oh well....maybe next time. Thanks- BDK"
5,Very different but very intriguing!,"I first saw this movie years ago on TV or something. About 5 or so years ago I remebered seeing it and set out on a quest to find it again, when I did, I remebered all the great scenes I had seen years before. Lorenzo Music, the voice of Garfield the cat, does an excellent job of voice over. Anyone who likes a movie that will just grab you and take you somewhere completely different and yet the same, will enjoy this movie!"
2,What about the R-rated version?,"I recently bought a copy of this movie from Amazon.com, and was disappointed to find that the video was the G-rated version.Back when I originally saw the movie, I saw a version theat was more PG/R rated. Synonymous Botch (The Bad Guy) was a little more vile, referring to the heros as ""poophead-turdbrains"", and included a classic shower scene in which you can see Botch in the shower, and he utters ""Ooh, Crunchy...Nutty...Chewy! I'll have to look in there more often."" You can't actually see where he is digging/tasting during this shower scene, but it is left to your imagination. So overall I was disappointed.If Amazon unearths the more unsavory version, I would buy a copy! (5 stars)Without the insults, this movie rates 2-3 stars at best!"
4,Good Product,"Fits the Camry perfectly and was bolt-on so you don't have to take it to the shop. However, would be better if it came with the accessory bolts and GASKETS! I couldn't find the the elliptical one of my shop and didn't get it online as i found out too late. I noticed a burning smell for a fews days-weeks after which probably comes from the new cat-not sure if that's normal or not-but everything work fine so. Exhaust if relatively quiet except the the missing gasket which make a hiss on strong acceleration"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I personally know this author and all I can say is save your money. The book is cheap rip-off. Don't waste the money.
4,Great pair of shoes.,I do recommend adding a sole insert (Dr. Scholl's) if you are going to be on your feet a lot. I went with a grey heel only one and it's perfect. The same goes for most dress shoes so this is a not specific to K. Cole.
3,A lackluster end to the series...,"Not much to say about the show in the third season that hasn't already been said, so I'll restrict my comments to the Blu-ray format.Sadly, there isn't much new in here in terms of bonuses. There isn't even a single episode with ""Starfleet Access"", like there were in the first season and, to a lesser degree, the second season. Granted, there isn't much about this season worthy of much commentary, but it still would have been nice to see some.The original pilot and unaired second pilot, along with the extended version of ""The Cage"" are nice to have, but they almost feel like filler. Even the Blu-ray case is thinner than the first two seasons'.I rate it three stars for the lack of effort on the part of the producers to take advantage of Blu-ray and provide more commentaries and specials."
3,Climax and Falling Action....,"While the Original Series hit its peak in the Second Season, that's not to say there isn't anything to enjoy in Season Three. Sure, Shatner's Rug looks terrible. Sure, the tunics aren't velour anymore. Sure, as a whole, the writing isn't what it once was, but we still get gem's like 'Spectre of the Gun' and 'The Empath'. We're introduced to Michael Ansara's Kang and a new hairstyle for Jimmy Doohan. Any real Trek fan who makes the active choice to buy the Original Series on Blu-Ray ain't gonna give a rat's ass ('tribble's ass' just wasn't worth it) about Season Three's short-comings. It becomes an obsessive/compulsive necessity to round out your collection."
2,All these DVDs keep stopping and freezing,"So I purchased the first two sets at Costco, and the third at Amazon. They are amazing, wonderful and worth the price, except...they ALL freeze and stop constantly. At first I thought it was my DVD player, so I played them in another brand DVD player. Same crap. They stop and freeze for minutes at a time, then come back. This is so irritating I don't know where to begin in expressing my frustration. They seem cheap and thin, am I the only one having this problem? Despite the wonderful content, they suck because you can't watch them without nearly constant interuptions of stopping and freezing. So buyer beware."
5,Great picture on Ble Ray,"Buy it if you are a Star Trek fan. It's worth it, just for better picture quality."
4,Brain Camp,"I'm really the first review on this? C'mon, no love for the #1 Camp episode of Star Trek TOS? It is cheesy on the surface, but the premise of this episode is classic pulp Sci-Fi. Anyone on an Star Trek nostalga trip simply -must- watch this episode.Best line ever- ""Brain and brain, what is brain!?"" :)"
5,Classic Trek at it's best,"There's not much I can say about the remastering of the original series that hasn't been already said. Its like watching Star Trek for the first time, again. I completed my set with the purchase of Season Three. So I must mention the packaging. This is the best packaging of any Star Trek DVD set that has come out of Paramount. And that's usually where Paramount cuts corners. But not this time. The clear and chrome plastic clamshell outer package is first rate. You'll want to leave all three seasons displayed on a shelf for all to see. They look that good. Each package includes plastic (not cardboard) episode cards making it easy to find the episode you're looking for without exposing the DVD discs to dust and fingerprints. But you better hurry. The remastered original series has been released on BlueRay in the standard BlueRay box. And these DVD sets won't be available much longer."
5,excellent,"I need Amazon's help. using your website i purchased the full series of Star Trek Next Generation. The link took me to DealsWorld.net. The DVD's they sent are terrible. Over half do not work! They will not provide a refund, will not respond to my emails. First, Amazon should not provide a link to a company who is bootlegging DVD's from China (the shipped from address) nor should you be endorsing a company with such horrible quality and horrible customer service. And if you can help me with my refund I would much appreciate it. I would never have ordered from them had the link from Amazon not been providedHELP!!!!"
5,Remastered,UP grade in images is Better than the old images .Love seeing the NCC 1701 in HD. GET it and see for yourself Service with Company is WARP 10.
3,A rather large gripe,Once again I am displeased with a series that changes the packaging mid release. Since all three seasons of Star Trek were released in the same year it shouldn't have been an issue here but it is. The season three box is a slimline Blu-ray case and doesn't match the first two. Come on! Some fans want their sets to match up like they should. Is that too much to ask?
4,"Nice collection, video Quality is OK","As the third installment in the Original Series Blu-ray edition, this follows exactly what was done in seasons 1 and 2. Packaging has been modified to fit everything in a smaller box. Certain video and special effects have been redone in CGI, mostly w/ good benefit - although they do stand out a bit from the rest of the 1960's production values - fortunately, most are limited to the external scenes of the Enterprise, planets, stars, etc. Video quality is probably as good as the original masters will allow - remarkably good given the original series was done in the 60's. All the episodes are in 4:3 format - so no wide-screen edition here. The only flaw I've noticed is that the entire edition (Seasons 1,2, and 3) all seem to have the audio gain turned way down - have to crank up the audio maybe 30% higher than on most other Blu-rays."
5,Star Trek season 3,Arrived promptly in great condition. Just what I needed for a gift for a Star Trek junkie
5,Trek On!,I have always been a fan of the original series and this remastered sets with the new special effects is spectacular. Even on epsisodes where there isn't a lot of effects if you watch you can see where they have improved even some of the smallest nuances that adds to your veiwing pleasure. definately an A++
1,Blu-ray -- here we come...but be prepared to be ripped off again by Paramount,"Finally they've released the 3rd season of yet another STANDARD DVD release.As hardcore Star Trek fans buy up this release, you can bet Paramount have begun plans for the release of the Blu-ray version.Knowing Paramount, there may be TWO Blu-ray releases:1. Blu-ray of the ENHANCED Star Trek...once everyone replaces the current release2. A Blu-ray version of the remastered ORIGINAL version (digitally cleaned up) for the Star Trek purists.Of course, if Paramount was a ""normal"" company, they would release both on the same release -- as a kind of a ""bonus""...but we're talkin' about Paramount here. You know it won't be reasonably priced so be prepared to be ripped off.However, on the bright side they may actually ADD extras such as cast commentaries...they have to.... if they hold off any longer, most of the original cast will be dead."
5,Cheesy and brilliant as always,"We have the original series on dvd but will definitely be watching the remastered versions from now on. The colors are brighter, the remastered effects done well and with respect to the original."
3,Weird agonybooth.com recaps (reviews) of some of this season's eps,"They claim when doing a recap of ""And the children shall lead"" that they are mentioning an episode title when they say"" The Enemy from Within"". But the first season ep title was actually ""The Enemy Within"". There are other ways agonybooth.comreviews are wrong."
2,disappointed again,it was still the wrong one but i wont send back because i dont have time to wait for it to be fixed again.
1,Laborious,"While there were some great and interesting ideas in this episode, it was laborious to sit through. The story moved at a snails pace, even when compared to other episodes. The music was the worst thing of all. Ive watched all the episodes in order and this one is the worse one I've seen.That said, the idea of the Empath it interesting and I like how they explored that theme. I think if it had another director or if he would have had another storyline it would have been much more bearable. And if he would have used another musical score that would have helped. At this point I can see why the show was canceled"
4,Glad I bought it but Not Perfect,"Summary:The Bad:This is heavy so think about that for travel. I try to travel light. Here is another item with weight to go in the briefcase.Do NOT BUY without the case. You don't want this glass like surface scratched or getting dirty. Very surprised it isn't included as I had to order one the day I bought this.This lays over the page you are reading so every two pages, you have to remove the item from the book and turn the page. Somewhat cumbersome and not necessary with normal reading lights. Very disappointing.THE GOOD:This definitely allows you to read without lights that bother your neighbor or spouse. Clearing that hurdle is why there are so many Reading Lights. This product does the job very well and I recommend it. BUT, make sure you can live with the Bad items mentioned."
5,Wouldn't want to live without it!,"I've tried other book lights, but this was the first one that really WORKED. I can now read at night and my husband can sleep in peace! The only issue is that the plastic does, indeed, get scratched over time. And, as someone else mentioned, it's not really practical for travel as it is somewhat fragile. But, even given those issues, it's the best gift I've ever received. I keep it on my nightstand and now can read any time I want to."
1,Don't even bother to try it,"Lousy, dim product. All I can add to the other negative reviews (other than my agreement) is that concentric ripples of light and dark emanate from the diodes. Not only is it too dim to read with in the first place,but you have to read across the alternating circles of light and dark...(Amazon edited out the rest of my comment, which was that I planned to return the item the next day.)"
4,battery compartment won't stay closed,I had to tape the battery compartment closed; otherwise I'd rate this as a 5. I really like the light for reading and it doesn't keep my husband awake.
1,"put a big scratch on it within the first 5 minutes, grrrr.....","I was trying to remove the page holder thingy and was pulling rather hard on it, when it popped out it put a great big scratch along the top of the acrylic lens. Great... I love damaging a pricey doodad within the first five minutes of owning it. Also, the bright/dim switch didn't work. There was only one lighting level. I'm returning it for that reason. So far, I'm not impressed."
4,Great once you get the hang of it.,"I was looking for a reading light that allowed me to read in bed without turning on a light. This light wedge did the trick. It is an interesting gadget. By illuminating the plexiglass your book page underneath also gets lit. I will admit it was difficult to get use to. Having to move this from page to page was annoying at first, but I got the hang of it soon enough. The glass does scratch easily. Whether or notep it in its protective foam it will get scratched. Most of the scratches come from the paper pulp itself.All in all this is a great light and I have been enjoying it for almost a year now."
4,Needs new clasp,"In the process of putting batteries into the LightWedge the flimsy little plastic piece that was supposed to be the clasp to close the battery door came off. There is no way to close the battery door and make it stay. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so put Scotch tape over the door. That feature was very poorly planned and should be replaced. Otherwise, the light works fine."
4,Best night reading light I've tried,"The light wedge has it's problems: It's small for many magazines or large books; static causes it to stick to some kinds of paper; imperfections or nicks in the plastic (mine came that way) require you to move it around a little as you read; light and dark whorls cause some uneveness in the light.None the less, it works. Here are the plusses: It doesn't wake my wife; the light is so bright I can read things (small print or print on colored background) I would never be able to read with a dim bedside light; the batteries last a long time; It's lightweight enough that it's not hard to move it as you read; it acts as a bookmark; it packs away easily in a suitcase.I recommend it"
3,Disappointed,"I bought one yesterday, and first spent a long time trying to jam the batteries in. The design is kind of clever to hide all the batteries so well, you won't think that it carries so many batteries in it. However, the design makes it very hard to put the batteries in, especially the last one. I was in fear that I may break it.So, finally I got the batteries in, turn the unit on and put it on top of the page. And all I saw was ripples. Rings and rings of light waves like in my science class. It is just way too distracting for me.I called the company's customer service, who picked up after a long time of ringing. She admitted that in some units the situation is worse than others, they are moving the production facility but meanwhile I should try exchanging it.I may, or likely I would get a different unit, because I realized that at my pace of reading, this unit would be too cumbersome to use.Thus, the search for the perfect reading light continues..."
3,scratches easy,the light is wonderful to travel with. I use it to read in the hotel room while my hubby sleeps and I can't turn on the lights or while were traveling at night I can read. however. this light scratches so badly!! this is my second one and my other one lasted a couple of years but already this one is scratched pretty bad. I always carry it in a book carrier to keep it from scratching. I think the quality went down.
5,I like THEM!,"The lightwedge lights are well-worth their money. They are convenient, helpful, and easily used. I have both types and find it a good bargain."
1,Scratch & Dent Book Light,"Purchased used, and boy was it used! I should have been suspicious when I saw the box. It was deformed, crushed,etc.When I tried to use it it looked like somebody had used steel wool to clean the plastic. The Book light when new hadBlack plastic edges attached to three sides - two of these were missing. Piece of crap. Too much trouble to send backAmazon, don' t do business with whoever posted this item..."
2,Just doesn't work,"It shipped via USPS, so by the time it finally arrived, I was full of anticipation.First of all, the worst problem, was that it was too dim. The moire patterns were weird and slightly green. Maybe my unit was faulty, but there is no way anybody could read anything on the high setting, much less the low setting. The brightest part was on the edge, which meant the light was aimed squarely at my sleeping husband. It really needs more diodes, but that would be such a battery drain.Second problem, no AC adapter was available.Then there were other problems like it was too small and dim for a standard textbook, and way too large for a paperback. The included clip to have it hang on the page didn't work, it was constantly falling onto my lap when I put it on my beloved tilted rolling reader's table. Also, like the other reviewers have said, it scratches up immediately, as well as fingerprints get all over its surface."
1,LightWedge way too dim,"The LightWedge has a gorgeous design, but the light is too dim for reading. The directions say that if the light is too dim to make sure all the batteries are working and inserted properly. I did this many times and still the light was too dim on the brightest setting. I have good eyes. I wonder how one product could be viewed (literally) so differently by the people who love this light. Again, the design and packaging are lovely. The light is too dim."
2,Very disappointing,"The lightwedge reading light does work, however the light is very uneven which is hard on the eyes. The glass wedge has a soft finish which is prone to scratching. This was a waste of money.LightWedge Paperback Book Light, Black"
3,"Great light, but not durable enough for the price.","This is a wonderful concept for a reading light. I didn't mind moving it as I turned the page and it provided great illumination for reading. However, the screen scratched very easily, making the light unusable (it is very difficult to read through scratches!) The price either needs to come down, allowing the light to be replaced frequently, or the screen needs to be more durable, or the unit should come with a screen protector of some sort."
5,Absolutely does the trick.,"I love this thing. I live alone, so I am not worried about needing to be courteous of someone trying to sleep next to me while I stay up all night. This serves another valuable purpose for me. I take it with me on the airplane. I travel a decent amount and I do my best to avoid turning on the overhead light. I find that it is too obtrusive to other people on the plane who are trying to sleep or enjoy the flight in relative peace and darkness. Cue my lightwedge. I can read with more than enough light and not bother the people around me.I like it so much I got one for my mom for Mother's Day. She fits into the category of readers who have tried EVERY booklight on the market and thus are dissatisfied with them all. She loves her lightwedge. Good brownie points for me.I do not like that the carrying case comes separately, though I do recommend you get one if you opt for the paperback-sized lightwedge and take it with you on trips."
3,don't get scratches,"Good product except if it gets scratched. Then the scratches will show up on top of the words in the book you are reading. There is enough light, though, so you can read while your spouse sleeps."
4,Works well,"This product works well as advertised, an ingenious application of a good idea. It does require a protective covering when not in use to prevent scratching the plastic surface, but a plastic bag works well. Note that the case sold for the device does not come from Amazon and thus incurs a separate shipping charge. The only negative that I noted was that the batteries were difficult to insert. The device does work with NiMH rechargeable batteries."
1,Light Wedge Book Reading Light,the lamp is not bright enough. Sad to say that Oprah's recommending this product was a poor choice. we returned the lamp and requested a refund.
4,"48"" Parrot ladder",these are small for the length - which is good because they take up little space - however please be careful because they break very sasily
1,Pure Drivel,Did you hear Tony Orlando was arrested? Seems like he was always wakin' at the crack of dawn.
4,i like it,"the skim milk became a wonderful smooth froth, the reason i did not give 5 stars is because the knob on top could have a shape that would make it easier to keep a hold of when pumping it to make the froth"
4,"""Moving"" in more ways than one","I don't remember how I came upon this film, where I learned of the title. Must have been a little bit of serendipity.Though this is the story of one family's experiences, the themes are universal. Native southern myself, I recognized a lot of my heritage - some of it positive, and some not so much. Both the good and the bad were included in ""Moving Midway,"" nothing hidden, nothing swept under the rug.The way the past was woven in with the present may be the documentary's best quality. As such it works well for those of us who are familiar with the themes, yet it would also be of interest to those without a direct southern lineage. Historians and genealogists could glean much from this one family's experience, one which is not at all uncommon. Even someone with only a passing interest in the South and its history would come away with a greater understanding of this difficult chapter in our country's history.Highly recommended."
1,Misleading Title,"The title of this book is highly misleading. The fire of 1991 was in Oakland - across the bay from San Fancisco, and while many of the replacement houses built on the burned out hills have been designed by San Fancisco-based architects, they are not 'San Francisco' houses."
4,Works fine,"Product installed very quickly, my computer recognized it immediately and I haven't had any problems with it after about 5 weeks of use."
5,Versatile serving Piece or Spoon rest,"This piece has an appealing shape; I've seen it described as a ""vegetable stick tray,"" ""utility tray,"" and ""relish tray."" Mine has a permanent spot on my stovetop as a spoon rest. It doesn't take up much space and it's long enough to accommodate any of my spoons, ladles, spatulas, whisks or knives."
4,Excellent review of classic Greek texts,"Euben's ideas and interpretations of some of the most political of Greek plays are both original and insightful. At times he loses the reader's interest by being a little too academic, but there is a hint of the humor that makes him one of the best political theory lecturer's in the country. This book is for anybody looking to understand the role of education, the educators and the educated. It is dry to read if you have not read the texts themselves. If you have, though, this book will blow you away."
1,I am not happy,"I ordered the DVD 'Heaven Can Wait' through AMAZON via RED TAG MARKET and when I tried to view it said it didn't work with my device(a Panasonic DVD player). Apparently it was made to be played ONLY in the United Kingdom, not the USA. I did not see in their description where it was made for the UK only. Needless to say I feel totally ripped off by Amazon and Red Tag Market. Consumers must lose millions to false and inaccurate advertising.I was thinking of trying to return it, but according to Amazon's return policy, once it's opened they won't take it back.Also, I kept getting emails from Amazon saying I ordered things that I didn't and then it showed that they were canceled. I emailed Amazon trying to find out why this was happening (they don't give you a phone number) and I never heard back from them."
2,"Watch for your ""region""","The movie itself is great, I bought this as a gift for my mother. However, the ""Region 2"" aspect is a complete flaw. US is ""Region 1"" and therefore the disc will not play in the US. As I purchased this DVD, I didn't know what ""Region 2"" meant, and I guess I should have looked into it, because now I have to return the movie and get a proper region. What a pain."
1,beware of the type of dvd you purchase,"This seller did not have listed any where , the fact that a region 2 dvd will not work on usa dvd players, very disapointing, the dvd does play on a computer. I think they should have some warning in their listing that this is the case, also the dvd was scratched even though they shrink wrapped it to send it to me."
4,Haven't viewed yet - Christmas present,"Can't give a full review yet because I've not viewed the DVD I purchased - going to give as a Christmas present. Can say that my order arrived quickly and was packaged adequately. So, for now, 4 stars."
5,One of the best....................,"In my view, one of the best films ever made. Not often reviewed as such, in part because it's a comedy (very few comedies win Oscars, as well). I've seen this film about twenty times on cable and never tire of it. It's well written, directed brilliantly by Buck Henry and the performances are impeccable. This is a movie about magic and even if you don't believe in angels, reincarnation, soul mates or other strange phenomena, this movie will win you over with its charm, humor and surprises. Watch for the scene where Warren Beatty is trying to convince Jack Warden that notwithstanding the physical evidence, he is actually an old friend -- it marks one of the greatest performances (by Warden) in film history."
4,A love story that makes you think,"The last scene when He says don't worry and She says so your the Quarter back is great, they say do I know you. You just have to wonder do we really have soul mates? A very special movie for couples in Love."
1,Not Playable,"Received the DVD, timely, but it is not playable in this region. Region #2 is on back of box. This is not for US regions. I did send an e-mail, to the company who sent this, but I have not had a response, as of yet. I would appreciate Amazon.com getting involved."
4,Good for the price,"Nothing is wrong with this product, it works as advertised although the close up view you'll need more distance. It seems to be made well. For me, this is best for when you see something which is just far enough away you can't comfortably make out what it is, this gives you just enough boost to see it.Like the classic eye test with the big ""E"" at the top. When you have made out the last line you can see with your normal vision, this would allow you to clearly see the next line and most of the one after. Something like that."
3,"Cheap, but not without virtue","This is just the kind of thing to send a kid off to camp with. Enough power to look at birds and deer and such, but because of the close focus, the best use is to watch bees on flowers, flies on the wall, and bugs/worms on the ground and in ponds/puddles. Perfect for budding entomologists.Of course, the optics aren't top-drawer, but they're OK for the price.EDIT and CAVEAT: They are so compact that it's easy to forget them in a jacket pocket...and then toss the jacket into the washing machine. Oops."
4,A little dim and blurry on the edge...,A little dim and blurry on the edge but can't be beat for size. 7x is not huge but again for the size and price it's great.
2,light but not very powerful,Well Bought it to spy on neighbours! jk actually I got it for camping to see birds and deers. The reason I wanted small is it was for hiking. It is really small and very light. but very very less powerful. I mean i dont bother taking out. my cellphone has a 5 x zoom on it and it is like 3 times better than this one.Its a great toy.Not for a person who actually wants to use it to see far away objects.A shot of what you can see without this and with this at 100 yards away would show that its useless. like I tested it out in a parking lot and well it did help to read plates of cars standing 2 lines further than what i cud read. BUT again this is not impressive. this is like a match when you need a maglight.very very weak.
2,"Eh, it's ok.","I must need to cut back on the coffee because I can't really see anything with this due to everything bouncing around. I do appreciate it's small size and relative affordability, but I'm questioning whether or not I'll ever get any good use out of it."
1,Too fragile,The day I received this item I tested by looking at the skyline outside my window and everything looked fine enough ... unitl I accidentally dropped it on the carpet. The short fall made the whole insides of the scope come apart and next time I looked through it there was just a blur.
1,Brenton Echo 7x18 Pocket Scope,This scope has a very small view. Not worth the price. I won't even give it as a present. Junk!
4,Satisfactory monocular,"This product met my expectations for a monocular priced under $30, except the close focus wasn't quite as close as advertised. Instead of 13 inches, it is more like 15-16 inches, but it focuses very smoothly and is free of major defects or optical aberrations."
4,For Looking Into My Aquarium,"I purchased this Brunton Pocket Scope for the purpose of looking into my micro reef aquarium to see with more detail the tiny creatures inside. It works reasonably well for this purpose, and certainly better than probably all other pocket scopes on the market since it has a near focus of 13 inches. Of course, to maintain focus at such close range, you need to be quite still. There is an aquarium specific product that I suspect works much better, but it costs around $400 (if I remember correctly). Considering it costs less than $25 here at Amazon, the Brunton earns 3.5 to 4 stars."
4,"Small, easy to hold, easy to use, 3 year old can adjust it.","Got this for multiple reasons but I wanted my 3 year old to use it as well. The optics were surprisingly good for the price range, it's very light and the case/strap are nice extras.1 star reduction for the materials. I understand it's a cheap selling unit but it the case cracked very easily, no noticeable affect on the use of it but it definitely does not hold up well to minor pressure, so careful where you store it if packing.All in all, I was not expecting the quality to be as high as it is compared to other items of similar nature and price."
5,Light weight Basic Monocular,"I used the Brunton Monocular on a recent trip with my nieces and nephews. It is simple to use, and they enjoyed the clear view from it.This is not a serious monocular in any sense, but it's good for days out when you just want to see something a bit more clearly without having to walk all the way there.Its lightweight and compact size means you can keep it anywhere without really feeling it."
4,No wonder Jack Bauer uses this!,"I admit I really picked this model and brand because it is the same model as the one Jack Bauer uses on 24. Well I didn't use it to stop any terrorists, nor save the US in an epic way, but for my uses this thing is great. It's small enough to always slip into a pocket or a back pack, and the focus is crisp and clear. At night, the monocular is a little dim, it's simply too small to allow much light in. For simplicity, ease of use and quality of optics, I give this 4 stars out of 5. Great price too!"
5,Great little scope,"I went to a few outfitter type store to look at monoculars and this one stood out as the best combination of magnification, field of view, and brightness. And in something that is the size of a film canister that costs about $25. Great to keep in your pocket on a hike or in your car's glove box."
5,WOW!!!,"Our church is using this series for confirmation. What a great presentation! I'm learning along with my teen. The theology is sound, and the presenter is so engaging. One caveat: he talks FAST. He has a ""no accent accent"", so that's not an issue. Make sure you have a good sound system or too much gets lost if you have to think too hard about understanding what he said. Then the meaning gets lost. The kids seem to be enjoying it, too, in spite of themselves."
1,"Nice try, Not really","To say that the author was the only European to travel the North-West coast of Madagascar in the last century is a complete marketing fib. I know of two Frenchman who rode the length and breadth of Madagascar, including the so-called ""zone rouge"" on horseback in 1995. I personally bought gems in the region in 1997. This book deserves its obsucurity in the dust bin of overblown travel writing. A lone white man facing the dangers of unexplored Madagascar... please, spare us."
3,Get a dictionary,"I just started the book. I was disappointed to find this statement on the first page of acknowledgments....""two rich boys executed their parents for financial gain, and the criminal justice system could not convict them of what they surely deserved, first degree murder"". An execution is a killing carried our as directed by a legal system. It is impossible for a person performing an execution to be convicted of murder. The Menendez parents were murdered. No amount of planning, deliberation, skill in doing the deed makes a killing an execution unless ordered by a legal court system. It is still murder no matter how ""professionally done""."
3,leaky ear cups,"I am a DM and due to monthly ear infections I decided to try this mask out. Unfortunately I can't get a seal around the ear cups, so water keeps leaking in. It might be due to long hair, whicha I have tried pulling back in every possible way, but still it's not really working out for me. My husband has gets it to seal better than I do, but he also experiences occasional leaks. Can't say I'm overly impressed, but I guess if you have short hear and a biggish head you might be in luck;)"
4,Very well done. Typical of the history channel,Up to the usual great standards of The History Channel. Jack Perkins' narration is great. Good learning tools. My kids enjed it.
2,"Very expensive, Very heavy, only ""fair"" photo quality","I bought this product with high hopes. I saw the price, saw the length of the lens, then hoped to be able to get some great nature photos. I used this produce only 5-6 times, all with some difficulty, as the weight of the lens alone is around 15 pounds. Add a heavy Nikon D1 camera, and the tripod has to support nearly 20 pounds.Getting a good photo was difficult, even with a remote shutter control. Just getting the camera/lens to stay focused on the subject was tough, as the heavy lens kept falling, slowly falling forward. The real disappointment came when i downloaded the photos to my computer. I got a few shots of eagles nesting close to where I live, but they were nowhere near as good as I had hoped for.I paid about $7,000 for this lens, including shipping. I would have never have paid that much for the results I got, had I knows in advance. $2,500? Yes. Over $7,000. No. Save your money."
1,Not programmed. See be;pw),"Lost the instructions. Can I get another one? When we get it programmed, I will tell you how it works."
2,Late Far Side strips don't age as well as you'd hope,"While my childhood trips to the Far Side were frequent and satisfying--like the finer bulk candy any sensible ten year-old will gorge themselves with when provided the opportunity--I find Larson's humor much more hit and miss as an adult. And I've always had the feeling that, like most cartoonists producing daily strips, Larson's well ran dry after several of his collections hit the shelves. The eight slim Far Side collection rehashes his familiar body of characters (Tarzan, bears, ducks, domesticated dogs, and the shallower end of our gene pool) in situations much less ""zany"" and endearing than you might recall. The gems are few (and none funnier than the classic ""Midvale School for the Gifted"" strip you've no doubt seen on many an educator's office wall), and most of the gags that land are of the slightly-bemused chuckle variety here. Stick with either of the two full-size collections for all of the undiluted sentimentality Larson's good for."
4,"definitely ""young-adult""","This book certainly fits the title for a young-adult book. It had all the cheesy lines and plots but, was entertaining. It is a quick read and was pretty enjoyable. The ending was quite abrubt though, and I think the author could have built it up a little more. Oh well! Read it if you want a slightly scary story!"
2,okay book,"it wasn't all that scary. but it's a good book. it was suspenseful, but there wasn't much that was really scary!"
2,too creepy,"I read Joan Nixon's ""The Haunting"" for my English Class. It was an okay book, but way too creepy. She used way too much dark imagery and all the supernatural stuff was just weird. I like mystery stories, but this was just over the top. I also decided tor ead it at night. Not a good idea. I did not sleep very well that night.I don't want to be to critical, but it was also very boring and hard to follow. I couldn't keep up witha anything going on in the book. especially towards the end. To me that's when it got really complicated. It was also kind of sad at both the beginning and end. It isa sad in the beginning when the great grandmother dies. I won't spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't read the book, but let's just say someone dies and it's very sad.Overall I did not like the darkness, boringness, or overall creepiness of this book. I would not recomend it."
2,Easy Read...,"This book wasnt all that good. It was very easy and simple to read...but the introduction is way too long. The book starts to actually get flowing in the last 20 pages or so, but then it ends abruptly. You naver figure out what happens after. Maybe it's because it was a book for school, but I didn't like it that much..."
