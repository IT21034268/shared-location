5,Detoxify yourself,I highly recommend this book to anyone who had or has a dysfunctional family. This book has helped me stand up for myself and become a much stronger person. This book was recommended to me by my Naturapath.
5,Very Insightful,"Even parents with the ""best intentions"" make mistakes that can stay with a child through their adult years and have a lasting and negative effect on the adults child's future relationships."
4,Blow away the clouds of denial,"Excellent explanations for all kinds of childhoods, parents and families. Detailed, practical and deep. This book would work well alongside psychotherapy sessions, as it has case studies and is comprehensive - but is limited in its way of accessing chidhood memories on the scale that is often required for overall healing."
5,truly helpful,"This was recommended by my therapist and was really helpful for me. I lent it to a friend and she found it helpful as well. In order for it to work, you have to be willing to follow its suggestions. Good recommendation and good book."
5,straight talk that can change your life,"I personally found this book to be life changing. It was first mentioned to me by a therapist four years ago and I found it to be one of the few books out there that is informative without being ""cheesy"". If you are looking for a book that is straight talk about different types of abuse--the author even paraphrases from clients which I found helped with personal identification--this is one worth your money. You will be amazed by how many times you will find yourself thinking ""that is so true!"" and the author does a tremendous job of weaving the reader through the healing process in a very subtle way (you won't find loads of psychological analysis talk here!)."
2,Ugly,"How ugly it is that in the co-author photography above, he is disguised in devil. When in other books covering the same topic it is not uncommon to read about paranormal problems, and satanism (like in ""The Narcissistic Family: Diagnosis and Treatment"" by Stephanie Donaldson-Pressman or ""MPD form inside out"").The book was very useful, but now I doubt. I have found other misleading books. It may be something broken in this book."
4,Somewhat helpful,"I thought this was a very helpful book in understanding your parents behavior and your response to it as an adult.I did agree with most of the author's plan for addressing the issue.I think you have to accept that you cannot change other's behavior, only your response to it and there were some great suggestions on how to do that in this book."
4,A Great Help!!,"Toxic Parents was extremely useful in helping me to understand my dysfunctional parents. Not all of the chapters pertained to me but they were very helpful in understanding others. I found a certain peace just after reading it, not even having to do the exercises mentioned. It will serve as a great reference book!"
4,To blame or not to blame our parents,"While half or us would like to deny that our parents have a big (and sometimes bad) influence over us, the other half would gladly blame their parents for their adult life problems. This book is kind of a midpoint between both positions. It talks about the painful legacies we get from our parents but also makes us responsible for our adult behavior. It isn't theorical or complicated, it's easy and full with stories that covers almost everything from verbal to sexual abuse.Some people don't like the title, but believe me it can't be worst, the title in Spanish is ""Padres que Odian"" (Parent's that hate).If you were raised by a human been and not a saint there is a big chance you can relate with this book, but remember to read it as a son or daughter not as a parent"
2,Their Fault.. Your Problem,"Having come from a dysfunctional family with a controlling mother and escapist father (I will spare the details)this book really hit home for me. Like many people, I didn't even realize our family had serious problems until I was in my late twenties. It has been and still is very painful. I confronted my parents by letter many years ago and got just the disappointing results this book warns of. I was considering doing it again and hoped this book would have helpful advice, but it proposed exactly what I had already tried. She says not to expect your parents to change, but that the process of confrontation will be liberating. Then goes through the pros and cons of confrontation and admits that it may not be worthwhile to actually confront your parents and that role playing with others may be more helpful. Okay... My thinking is that people that don't know they have problems aren't likely to be reading this. People that know, shouldn't expect to find their answers here..."
4,Good,Arrived on time and as expected. In retrospect this is the sort of book you should really Kindle given its title.
4,Satisfactory,The book was received in a fast manner and was received exactly as described. Very pleased with the book. Thank you! : )
4,"Symptoms linked to causes, good. Moral clarity, not so good.","In its first part Toxic Parents is really good about connecting symptoms to causes in adult children of toxic parents. And while the second part has some good exercises to work on in your healing from the abuse it is lacking in the moral clarity, not expressing a whole lot more doubts about the type of relationship possible with a toxic parent who does not respond positively to your trying to change the relationship. It leaves open the possibility that you might not want to have anything to do with a parent, but fails to explore the fact that wanting to remain in a weird place where you've confronted your parent and they've rejected that and you still want to be around them is indicative of still unprocessed feelings and a lack of true perspective on what was done to you. It fails to ask the question, would you continue to be satisfied with a relationship AT ALL with some random person who raped or beat or savagely criticized you?"
5,Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy & Reclaiming Your Life,"This book, for me, was very hard to put down. Reading other peoples' experiences and the results in their lives was heartrending and helped me feel less alone. The letters to parents helped me start to formulate letters to mine. This book was recommended by my therapist, and it has given me the strength to move forward.I HIGHLY recommend it. Thank you!"
3,Good book to start getting back your Life,This book helps you realize why you do the things you do and how you can try to resolve some of the issues that are caused by a dysfunctional child-parent relationship. I would recommend it to anyone who had strict parents.
5,Everyone should read this.,i am 46 year old lady that has been struggling to cope with my emotions and life because of my parents. I was abused very badly by my mother and thought it was all my fault and i didn't know my father was as bad as my mother until i had my children and relized that he let her do it to me and he never stopped her. This book has made me relise that it wasn't my fault and i am having help know to deal with it all.
4,"A book of healing, for those who survived a painful past",Dr. Forward helps us define our present by looking into our past. She helps us to realize that the person we are now is deeply seeded in the child who was not nurtured. She helps us define exactly what form of neglect or abuse was suffered and then deal with our feelings in a systematic way. I found this book to be both eye opening and healing.
3,Too simplistic for such a complex issue,"Of course my parents are toxic, and it is their fault, and it damaged me. From the reviews I have readIt took her the, I think most agree on that. I would like a better understanding of the psychology and a toxic parent-child relationship. It took her the whole book to explain that it wasn't my fault. I know. Now, I would like a more thorough strategic plan that actually empowers me to be mentally delivered from my damage. I will do that rest of the work on my own because I have no ther choice, but if another another toxic parent book comes out that actually offers an effective srategy then my hands are on it."
5,Toxic Parents,"I am an abuse suvivor who is just starting on my journey toward emotional health. This book helped me to understand that my feelings and actions are not abnormal for someone from my background. I wish that my father could read this book so he could understand why I acted the way I did as a child. However, the title would make him very defensive, so he would not read it. This book also helped me to see the role both parents played in the family's disfunction. It helped me to quit protecting the ""passive abuser"". I was so impressed with this book that I shared it with my therapist. ** This book should not be used as the only source for recovery, but as a tool to be used in conjunction with therapy.** I would highly recommend it not only for abuse survivors, but for toxic parents who are seeking to understand and change."
5,Toxic Parents,This book was a wake up call for me and helped me see how disfuctional my family really was and how I needed to set boundaries.Linda
3,Every circumstances are diff,I liked the book...maybe a bit draggy. Good to know certain things and put into better perspective but this book didn't help me! I been on a tough road and learned the hard way and took things into my own hands and the majority played out in the book was already instilled in me and/or I took the same steps but this book might help others in need. Good to have.
3,So far so good...,"I have not had the chance to read this book cover to cover yet, but so far this is a good book to use in your personal life or to debate in a psychology class. This is not a book for people who refuse to believe this could not possibly include them, simply because they will spend more time arguing with themselves and sink further into denial then learn or benefit even a little. I was shocked to see some similarities with my own parents and own family. I am definitely recommending this to other friends and thinkers."
5,Lived the imperfect life,"Leanna Jackson, going to be a survivor,This is an excellent book and speaks as though it is talking about my own past. It has helped me to understand and learn to deal with the wrongs that i endured, and to learn how to make it right within myself.Also recommending: Nightmares Echo-because I was a child of sexual/child abuse and it spoke to me plainly. Lost Boy-Because I understood what he went through"
1,Overly Simplistic but Good Tips,"As someone who has a toxic mother, you know how everyday feels like an eternity when you feel so much pain inside. Half of the book is about other people's experiences with her in therapy and the other half is about how we can change our situation ourselves. I gave her 1 star because of this very important point that she misses: If you have a truly toxic parent, confrontation is not the answer (as she says). I agree with the other reviewer who gave one star because it doesn't seem like she has truly been in this kind of a situation. The REALITY of LIVING WITH TOXIC PARENTS is that THEY DO NOT CHANGE. I am a grounded and fair minded person, but I think her advice is baloney. And she spent chapters on bits of advice that you could outline on one page. I felt so bad after reading it. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts with all of you."
5,A REAL EXPERT SPILLS THE BEANS!,"It is obvious from the beginning of this book that the author is not only truly experienced but is revealing some REAL INSIDER INFO! So many of these mail-order books just rehash the same tired junk...not this one! Mr. Thomas lets you in on the inside and lays it all out in a simple, easy to follow step-by-step method. Anyone of average intelligence could use his techniques to make some REAL MONEY in mail order. i truly great piece of work!"
2,A curate's egg,"Why has ""Nikki Hoshino"" written three (slightly) different reviews for this book?This is possibly a sincere effort, but it isn't very good for all that, and it displays its colours as a self-published (iUniverse) title all the time. In my opinion if you can't distinguish between ""principle"" and ""principal"" you shouldn't be writing a book, editor or no editor. Picky? I don't think so.I've given it two stars because I found two interesting things in it. Though I can't remember what they are.To be honest there are few if any good books on how to make money in mail order out there. I'm waiting on Melvin Powers's classified ads book, and crossing my fingers that it will be The One."
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"Seeing 'A Reader' and 'Nikki' submitting 5-star ratings multiple times should clue you in to the shadiness of this book. I had the misfortune of ordering this book before there were any reviews written about it. Come to think of it, I should have written the first review to warn others. The book is laden with typos and grammatical mistakes. Whoever proofread the draft should be fired (if he isn't already). All the info contained in the book can be found in the internet for free. The only revelation I got from reading the book is that I just made the author that much closer to his $100,000-a-year goal..."
3,"Great musicians, not so great mix","I am torn on this review. The playing on the CD is incredible. Steve Smith is a Master Craftsman at the drums. But what caused this recording to suffer was the mix. Way too much Bass. At times it really overpowered the rest of the musicians. The first 2 songs were very noticeable. I played the music in a friends computer and it sounded like distortion. I noticed that on my PC speakers AND my car stereo. So across the board, if you are a fan of Bass you'll love it. If not, well, you may want to set your EQ to cut the bass frequencies.Other than that the music is GREAT."
4,Seeker,"This book is one of the three written in the series. It is a refreshing thing to see a new type of fantasy novel. This book takes place in a world that is almost run out and Sorak the main character clings to whatever is left of a dying but not dead world. I call him Sorak because he is the owner of the body, but he is composed of several different personalities both male and female, manifested at a young age. From the Guardian who acts as a parent to Screech who talks with all animals, there is an enjoyable diversity not only in character but in landscape. I strongly recommend this and the other two books of this series (Nomad, outcast)"
4,Jesus and the other names,"A very good book written by the auther Paul F. Knitter. He wrights about the pluralistic religions etc. He wrights in a way that make you intressted.One of the best books about religions I ever reed, and I have red alot in this 2 years./Lisa"
1,Don't buy this.,"Might as well have burned the money. The text of this short article came through immediately, but with all the illustrations omitted. As this was a craft article, the illos tell most of the story. Makes as much sense as selling you a book with pages torn out. Syn Ferguson, Camas, WA"
1,"Anson Funderburgh, Rockets: Thru The Years: A Retrospective","A girl I once dated who first saw Anson at the King Biscuit Blues festival in Helena Arkansas used the words ""Master of the Stratocaster"" to describe Anson Funderburgh. I of course thought, ""Come on, Master, what about Eric C. and SRV"", but once I saw him play, I knew what she was talking about. He really combines the 50's sound with a classic blues sound. And he is only half of it. Lead singer Sam Myers is a huge black guy with Coke bottle lenses for glasses. He looks like he is in his 80's and moves real slow, but it all makes a good show. When Sam puts an old fashioned microphone up to his mouth with his harmonica, he defines the word feel when it comes to blowing the harp. I myself am a Bass Player, and pull this CD out every time I need to practice my up-right Double Bass. I know I am in for a good work. It is a great CD to play at parties too. Everyone always wants to know who it is. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Spell-Binding,I've had two copies of this tape and both times have misplaced it.I'm going out to buy it again and this time it'll go under lock and key. This is by far the best from Freddie. The whole album is my favorite. he couldn't top this one if he tried!
2,Mislabeled!,"Just received my order and am disappointed. (I know it's only paper) However we use heavy paper for our business warranty's, this is our first paper order through Amazon. The paper wrapping was torn in shipping box and the paper is not what we ordered. We ordered 24 lb., the package says 60 lb. and what we got feels like 20 lb. if that, it is too thin for our use. Have had good results with PAPERWORKS.COM in the past and will have to reorder through them. One would think that a company like Wausau would get it right."
3,Disappointed,"My rating is colored by the fact that I am not really a fan of jazz fusion, which is what this recording contains. Having said that, I would note that there are some great moments of virtuosity on the record, such as some of Holdsworth's guitar playing, but I just feel that most of the main musical themes are somewhat unimaginative. There was just nothing that really grabbed me."
1,Am I missing something here?,The reviews for this CD were so great that I ordered the CD from Amazon without hearing it. No matter how many times I listened to it I just didn't like it. I played it again and again hoping that something would click... Regretfully I will sell it...
5,One of the best records I ever heard...,"I had forgotten about this record because my cassette tape collection has been stashed away in the closet for quite some time now. A friend of mine had taped the LP and I played it all the time in the early eighties. Being a bassist, I was a huge Jeff Berlin fan and always liked Bruford. The performances are amazing as you would expect. So, I'm at a gig recently and our keyboard player is unloading his car. His stereo is playing and the track ""Five G"" starts - I hear this killer slap bass intro and I know I've heard this before, but couldn't name the band. The funny thing about that track is that Jeff Berlin is not really known for his slap bass playing. It's like he just dabbled with it, mastered it and moved on. After discussing what record it was, I did a quick search, found the CD and bought it. I hadn't heard this record in over twenty years and I'm glad I discovered it again by accident."
5,Treasure of Tracks...,I never knew who performed the underrated tune Flamethrower.I loved it for its sheer r&b party romp audacity a la Cameo Word Up style. The entire album was an excellent overture in southern rock and roll with a bit of blues and funk elements. The last track Pissin on the Wall is a hoot ! This is the kind of rock band that defied being categorized or victimized as another passe 80's new wave synth band. The J. Geils Band was pure fun and explosive rock and roll with a slight R&B funkafied blues feel !...
3,"shoop, shoop, dee-da-lee-da-leet...","Check it out... this band has a guy named ""Magic Dick"" and they do a song called ""Piss on the Wall"".... no wonder we loved this when I was in second grade(!). Truth be told, however, from the safe distance of 18 intercedant years, this album sounds a little too synth-heavy and over-the-top pop-hooky for my present taste. ""Rage in the Cage"" does kick booty though. For a real slice of vintage J. Geils Band, check out _Sanctuary_, _Nightmares..._, or any of their live albums."
5,Freeze Frame is great,"Great ""album' I had lost due to wearing the cassette out. I was very happy to be able to listen to it again!!! All songs are great!!"
3,journey back to mexico,"Robert Frerck's book Eternal Mexico covered the vast country from the barren desert to the lush carribean. He has taken time out to get the perfect photograph. He did not bombard the book like other authors/photographers with pictures of the many ruins that mexico has to offer. Instead he included many photographs of the majestic side of the Mexican people and their culture. The true Mexico. His photographs of the famous places are not those sold on the counters of ""tourist shops"" and on postcards. Robert has managed to capture a different side to these famous places that many of the other books/ photographers have failed at. I have only one regret that the book was not larger with more photographs. It was good to sit down with and reminisce over my travels in Mexico."
4,Best for novices,"This is a good book, but only if you are using it to gain BASIC knowledge about the weather. If you are looking for a book that deals with forecasting, look elswewhere."
3,It's just a pocket guide,"If all you want is a handy quick reference for weather-watching, then this (very thin) book is good. I had wanted to learn all about weather, and really needed more examples, pictures, explanations. So I'll find and read a real text book, but then I'll carry Hodgson's little book when I go hiking."
3,Good but at times boring.,"This book was recommended to me as a ""dramatic"" story. While I did find the depiction of life on a sheep farm in Wales interesting I would at no time describe the book as dramatic. However I would like to visit Wales now so maybe it could be used to intice tourists?"
4,Dog toy,"My Jack Russel loves it, only thing is he chewed off the ears within the first ten minutes of play. But he still has fun with it anyway."
1,I think they sent me a used one,I ordered 2 different colors of the same toy. I think this one was shipped used since it was not in the package and the elastic is stretched out on it. The other one is great.
1,Worthless,"Got it delivered today, took it out and started to play tug of war with my 7 month old pit bull. I heard a rip & before I knew it, it had tore along a seam & the stuffing and squeaker were pouring out. Reba the Rottweiler didn't have this problem so I can honestly say Wiley is terribly constructed. Don't waste your money on this weenie dog!!! Very disappointed!!!"
5,good for teaching ESL,"The text follows this pattern: ""A bus takes me to school. A car takes me to the market.""This is an easy pattern for students of Enghlish as a second language to understand.The book is good for lessons on present tense verbs, vehicles, or places in the community."
3,"close, but no cigar","It is easy to be excited by the promise of this little book. Its austere but stylish cover displays an old, rare, beautiful instrument. The instrument was created by a sublime craftsman. In recent years it has been played by another, and now it has been restored by a third. The cello has an intriguing name and the cover notes suggest a history to match. Alas, seduced readers will be left unfulfilled. The story is simpler than the promised romance. Ardent admiration is obvious in descriptions of the knowledge and skill of the craftsmen, but little of any depth is revealed. Even the illustrations disappoint. It's a beautiful package and will look well on any shelf. However what might, with more control, have been a delightful article in Vanity Fair is, instead, bloated, swollen and grandiose."
4,Very well broken down,"This video is definitely not for beginners! Get the first video if you are, there are plenty of nice steps and variations there. Josie breaks down each partners step individually, making it easy to follow. The level 4 part ""Hot steps and trick"" (or something like that) is pretty lame for my taste. I was expecting more partner to partner dancing but turned out to be include several solo steps. Overall, I found this tape to be very good for two reasons:1. She knows how to dance!!! (unlike some other video instructors)2. Each step is repeated at least four times before moving on to the next."
2,just bought the video.....,i'm an intermediate/advance dancer - the steps are great for beginners - i found the steps too basic for intermediate dancers.The quality of the tape is not that great (can't get a clear picture when you pause it or slow-play it :(lessons are explained very thoroughly - i would recommend this video to intermediate/beginner dancers.
4,It was good!,"Why doesn't anybody have anything good to say about this film? The acting was ok, the directing was very good (honestly it was great), and it was quite an original film too. And, for those people who apperently dont know any urban legends, everyone in this film was killed in an urban legend. If you like horror films, watch this and im sure you will enjoy it. If you didnt like it, keep it to yourself and get over it. Its just a movie.I enjoyed the first film and I think that this one could very easily be better!"
5,"Great Team, great scares, great movie!","URBAN LEGEND and URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT are both really cool scary movies. I actually prefer the 2nd, because I just loved everything about it. The death scenes are very scary and won't let you be disappointed! I wish that URBAN LEGEND 3 becomes reality soon!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. MOST SEQUELS ARENT. ENOUGH SAID
4,Well I Liked It,"Well despite all of the negative reviews I think that this movie succeded I mean it did better at the box office than Book Of Shadows Blair Witch 2 and that film was more popular than this one so it pretty much tells you that people liked it enough to see the freaken thing than a film many thaught was better meaning BW2. Anyway at the begining of the film you would surely think that the acting is the worst you've ever seen, but then it turns into the real thing.Anyway if you liked the first one you would probably like this one. See it.Pluss a good score is added to it but not by Christopher Young."
2,People actually LIKED this????,"Oh good lord, where to begin?The first one was really good. A bit of a twist on the run-of-the-mill slasher plot from Scream, Halloween, etc. In fact, I would put the first one on par with the first Scream movie (3rd was the best IMO) and better than most other movies of this genre. This one however...was pathetic. Nothing more than a badly acted rush-job of a sequel made to cash in on how good the first one was. The plot had a few interesting points, but the characters didn't really DO or say anything to make me...ya know...CARE about them. And the killer was not scary at all...in fact I thought the murderer, complete with his totally frightening FENCING HELMET, was laughable and had the IQ of a turnip.Don't bother. Rent a good slasher movie. I recommend the first and most recent Halloween movies and the 3rd Scream movie.And the original Urban Legends, if only to make you forget the crud that this movie was."
2,big deal another teen slasher flick.,"has anyone else noticed that all these movies are the exact same thing, a couple of hot chicks get sliced and diced, and one chick survives and some guy also. these type of movies arent even scary anymore, they are so predictable.Onto this movie itself, its about the killer in a mask(as usuall)who wants to slice up some teenagers because he wants some credit for this movie. When it comes down to it if youve seen scream or i know what you did last summer then youve see this one because its the same thing."
2,"Final Cut, Didn't Cut It","I gave this movie two stars because I loved the........... poster. When I saw the poster I was totally pumped. Then I watched the movie and my Balloon was popped. Disappointing, totally horrible, and did I mention disappointing. The Preview for this movie gave to much away, so the scenes that would have been climatic weren't because of what you already knew. Sometimes they say a preview has all the best parts from the movie, well in this case the preview was the best part! If you want to remeber the first one as a great film like me, you won't ever mention this one. Bottom line: FINAL CUT, DIDN'T CUT IT."
1,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?,"There are to many negative things to say about this movie that I have no idea where to begin. For Gods Sake this movie seriously gives a bad name to Horror. There was absolutely nothing scary about this piece of garbage. First of all, I have to agree with others and say that people were just ripping of Scream in some way when they made this, but unfortunately just made the movie 100 times worse. The plot, acting, and especially killings in this movie [was not good]! I encourage all others out there to save your money from buying this movie and even renting it. As someone has already suggested, rent or buy the first Halloween movie if you want to be introduced to a good slasher."
1,movies like this needs to show the killings,this movie is nothing like the first one. The first one was ok. the one major thing about these movies is that most of killings are all shown after the fact. The movies are also slow starting to get into anything I would even like to watch. I understand about the build up but with the first two of these movies the build up seems to just build up and lead to nothing all that special or enlightening. I love horror movies but I dont know why I bought the first one anymore? these movies are worth renting but that is about all.
3,not bad....,"After watching this for the first time I didn't like it. But after watching it again and paying attention to what's going on, I enjoyed this film. I keeps you guessing who the killer is. The first one is way better but this isn't that bad. I liked it. I rate it 3 stars because it isn't as good as the first. Still a good movie. Go rent it and see if YOU like it."
2,"""Urban Legends... Better be the Final Cut""","This is an incredible, yet terrible sequel to ""Urban Legend."" How does the story involve urban legends anyway? A filmmaker wants to win an award, but unfortunately her crew is disappearing one-by-one. What an enigma! Not! ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" does have one good scene that makes Hannibal Lecter look like a preschooler though. You'll know it when you see the girl in a bathtub full of ice and then she discovers that she's missing something... This movie has Joey Lawrence (TV's ""Blossom"") and Anthony Anderson (noisy guy from ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Exit Wounds""). Yes! No! Who is the main star? Nobody cares or should care. Poor film."
2,Very Unnecessary Sequel,"Urban Legends: Final Cut was a waste of effort. UL2 cuts away from the original film, which warrants more effort than this installment, with Loretta Devine as the only returning cast member.This film focuses around a different group of college students at a different university. All of them are vying for the prestigious Hitchcock award, but one of them will stop at NOTHING to get it. Soon, people start dropping off like flies. I didn't even feel much emotion or sympathy towards any of the victims. It lacked strong character development and most of the acting was tedious at best. However, some credit is due. The kidney scene is by far the best scene in the movie, and if more of the film was as suspenseful and scary as this, then the film would have been a LOT better. I really do hope that this is the FINAL cut."
2,sequel that has little to do with the first movie!,"This sequl has very little to do with the first movie! The only person from the first movie is the security guard. The plot has many holes it. This movie is Ok ,maybe it's better with commentary from the director? Watch this movie if you horror/slasher movies with little or no plot. This movie is a mainsteream movie so odd's you have seen it done before!! Urban Legands:Final Cut also rips off from the Scream movies in the types of situations the characters get killed!! The ending has the first killer as a nurse in a hospitla talking to this killer of this movie! The ending also has music from ""Afred Hitchcock Presents"" in the end credit? Could'nt they come up with some orginal music for this movie and the end credits?"
1,URBAN LEGEND? YEAH RIGHT!,"I SAW THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I LIKED THE FIRST AND THE CAST WAS WELL KNOWN. THE SEQUEL HAS A CAST OF UNKNOWNS WHICH SHOULD STAY THAT WAY CONSIDERING THE ACTING WAS JUST PLAIN HORRIBLE IN THE MOVIE. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH URBAN LEGENDS. THE FIRST DEATH HAD PROMISE AND SLOWLY AS THE MOVIE PROGRESSED IT GOT DUMBER AND DUMBER AND THE ENDING WAS JUST AWFUL. THE MOTIVE WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS THOUGHT UP AT THE LAST MINUTE, TO SAVE MONEY MAKING THE FILM. IT WAS DEFINETLY ONE OF THE WORST OF 2000, AND ANYONE WHO PUTS THEIR HARD EARN MONEY TO RENT IT OR BUY IT ON DVD WILL REGRET IT!"
1,URBAN CRAP,99 mins of suck..good thing i don't have a life..some nudity (eva mendes' fun bags?) definitely would have raised this movie another star..couldn't wait to look at the talent files(he he)after the movie was over..can't wait for the next one
2,legends gone WRONG!,this 1 was nowhere close to being as good and original than the original. it barely even uses any legends what so ever to kill someone. not scary not even funny. not a good example of a slasher film. hell i wouldnt even call it that. its more of a pathedic mystery rather than horror. the only thing thats good about this is the killers costume is cool and hot eva mendez is a lesbian in this. to bad she dies. hell shes not the only one. this whole movie looks as if it was picked up as road kill and then got some cheap thrills added into it. in my opinion it made it even worse. completely flat and dead.
2,Not good,The first urban legend was pretty good decent horror film but this sequal just sucks. The begining of the film is ok and you think it might be good but then as it gets further into the film it just gets worse and the ending is stupid. It leaves you saying is that it? It revolves around university students who are trying to get an acting award and all these deaths start occuring. It does keep you guessing until the end about who the killer is but the killer isnt even scary and wears a fencing mask and the story is lame/not well acted.I watched this 2 or 3 times and it dosent get better as you watch it gets worse every time. I wouldnt recomend this to anyone. Go watch the first one.
4,Must See For Modern Slasher Fans,This is much better than the first Urban Legend. If you like slasher flicks this is for you. The first film was ok but this is the one you wanna see. I've been watching a lot of slasher movies lately from Psycho to Hatchet. This has been one that stuck out. I love the ending.
1,dont waste your money,OK THE FIRST ONE WAS AWESOME.....BUT THIS ONE WELL IT JUST SUCKED. THERE WAS NO PLOT TO THIS MOVIE. AND AT TIMES IT WAS CONFUSING. SOMETIMES MOVIES ARENT MEANT TO HAVE A SEQUEL. WELL THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES. ITS NOT WORTH YOUR 2 HOURS.
1,"Urban Legends, The worst movie...","I really enjoyed the first urban legends movie, but this one I was not impress by at all. I wish I would have taken these reviews more seriously that I read before buying this dvd. This was an awful cheapo urban legends movie. Theres nothing here to come close of where the first urban legends was. I see now theres a third urban legends movie out, im not sure if that ones good or bad, like this one. If you have a couple of bucks to blow, go ahead and get this one. If you seriously want a good atleast kinda scary movie, look else where.P.S. No wonder this dvd is only $9.00 bucks"
1,Far From a Legendary Movie,"Do we really need another teen-slasher flick after dozens of ""Scream"" copycapts produced in the mid-to-late-nineties?? If we do, they better be more interesting than this tepid and predictable cinematic experience. Apart from the mildly engaging beginning and a somewhat decent ending (the scene with the multiple guns in particular), ""Urban Legends - Final Cut"" is nothing more than a sequence of tired and unengaging cliches. The acting is wooden and souless (the lead actress is competent, though), the direction lacks punch and the plot offers few surprises. This movie is disposable, unconvincing and tries to seem smarter than it really is (with all those pseudo-intellectual cinematic references to make it clever and hip).A waste of time."
2,Not As Fun As Original,"Urban Legends 2 is not a good movie. It makes the first film, which was fun and entertaining, look like Oscar material. This film, about a bunch of film students at a cold looking college campus working on student films who are stalked by a killer in a fencing outfit, is nowhere near as fun as the original. Jennifer Morrison as the heroine is cute and everything, but she's kinda boring. Former teen heartthrob, Joey Lawrence, is okay as a pompous rich kid. Loretta Devine, returning from the original, is, like in the first, the real standout. The killer's outfit is pushing it a little bit. I think filmmakers are running out of ideas for the killers. The ending isn't as well done as the original either. What are you going to do?. Urban Legends 2 is decent as a mindless horror sequel, but if you've seen the original, then there is no reason to see this. It's not as good or memorable or intelligent as any of the Scream sequels. A typical horror sequel. Nothing special."
2,Bad Sequel.,"The first Urban legends is pretty good. Not as good as Scream series but I like it better than ""I know what you did last summer"" series. But this one is a miss. Set in a film department of a University where film students got murdered. The actual killer is not surprising, most of you who watch this type of movie should be able to guess who it was. The DVD is OK. Bright and clear picture and solid sound. Not recommended though."
2,too much of it,"When you order, you mignt expect to find more exclusive gags, of smth special, but it's just too long and too boring - IF you are not a very big fan of it"
5,Great Christmas present,"My hard to buy for friend was thrilled with this Monty Python video that she'd never seen before. I was a little worried that this gift wouldn't get here before the holidays, but it did. I can't wait to view it with her."
1,Not informative,"I was expecting a guide to putting together a balanced diet for myself during pregnancy. I was terribly disappointed. This book is full of opinions, medical and nutritional misinformation, and personal anecdotes. Its main message is that it is OK to follow a vegetarian diet during pregnancy. I knew that before I read the book.I found ""What to Eat When You're Expecting"" to be much more helpful. ""What to Eat"" has plenty of guidelines for putting together a diet that contains the nutrients you need, whether or not you make a vegetarian choice."
3,Good information but too much redundancy,I am a vegetarian of 15 years and my husband and are trying to get pregnant. I thought that getting as much knowledge as possible on making sure the baby's health was protected was a smart choice. I purchased a few books from Amazon.com and this book left me annoyed. It had good information but could have been condensed to half it's size. She repeated herself throughout the entire book. She added too many personal experiences from others in which she said answered an add that she wrote. To me it was a easy way to write a book. I wish she had researched the issue more and had valid facts instead of so many opinions. The last thing was that throughout the book (almost after every line) she says (See... this and that section). Simply reverting back to previous sections. It just seemed to me that she was filling pages to make a book and not really caring that if the content was truely informational.
1,DANGEROUSLY INACCURATE,"I agree that this book is poorly organized -- but on top of that, the information in it isn't even true! For example, she claims that tofu has 20 grams of protein for four ounces-- not on this planet. In reality it's about half of that, about 9-13 grams. Same deal with beans-- she says 22 grams of protein in 1/2 cup of black beans--truth is more like about 7g! She also says that ""iron anemia during pregnancy is normal."" Yikes!! It's terirbly dangerous and can make you hemorrage during birth! Chuck this book!"
3,needs more recipes,"this book needs more recipes!! the majority of it is letters to the author about their vegetarian pregnancy. it is more a supportive book for vegetarian mothers, than a helpful recipe book."
5,Read this book.,"One customer-reviewer (pjdecaprio@bkb.com) kindly left this on a plane for someone else to find. Lucky for that person. The first 40 pages alone are worth the price of the book, to get a deep understanding of how small events and misunderstandings can get blown out of proportion to tragic consequenses. I certainly did not expect this to read like a novel. I anticipated a rich, informed description of one of the most significant periods in contemporary history, and was amply rewarded by Mr. Branch's work. He is obviously passionate about the subject, but maintains detachment. And only by reading Representative John Lewis's book, ""Walking with the Wind"", did I come to know of Mr. Branch's involvement in the movement. He doesn't toot his own horn, but rather gives a wonderfully rich, compellingly written, moving account of one of the USA's greatest social achievments. Thank you, Mr. Branch. Now, finish up the third one!"
3,Mr Branch loses his way,"Parting The Waters won the Pulitzer Prize, and deservedly so. But whereas PTW starts slowly (with Dr. King's upbringing, education, and entry into public life) and builds to the the Children's March (as heart-wrenching as any battlefield story), ""Pillar"" seems to wander aimlessly through the next two years without much emotional involvement. The events leading up to the assasination of Malcom X are matter-of-fact, and the deed itself is almost an afterthought.Having said all that, ""Pillar"" is still an excellent account of those years, just not the brilliant narrative its predecessor was."
5,This was the Best book I ever read.,Omar I like the topic you picked to write on the book. I like the ways you express the words I think it's a great book for teens today. Omar keep up the good work and keep your head up.
4,More tangled than Parting the Waters but just as good,"The rather straight line story of the civil rights movement that is told in Parting the Waters becomes much more tangled and complex in Taylor Branch's second book. Here the movement begins to intersect more directly with the other currents of social unrest in the country and the conflicts both within and outside of the movement blur the lines of clear right and wrong.This is a great piece of social history with the civil rights movement and MLK as the focus. The more success King achieved the more pressure he was under - both from his enemies and his supporters. This was a difficult time for the country and for all those who were - in whatever way - trying to change it. Branch does an invaluable job in trying to distill the mass of detail and the great complexity of the sociopolitical scene into a coherent story. It's harder to do here than in the first book, but he manages nicely. Good job. Worth reading carefully."
3,Canon len - a gift,"I purchased this as a gift. I did not use it, but it met the expectations of the end user."
3,Not worth the price,"Ok, so i bought this last night from a friend for $50...What a steal. I have been shooting on a 50mm f/1.8 and i love that lens, but it cant zoom. I shot for a whole day yesterday on this lens and it was pretty good, but not worth the $299 its selling for on here. I would recommend the 18-55mm IS lens, the extra stops really make a difference. This lens has a soft focus (well to me anyway). None the less, i have enjoyed shooting on this lens with my XTi and it is a good starter lens, but you are better off buying different lens (unless you can finds this one for under $100)"
1,Only Someone Who Hasn't/Doesn't Read Reviews Would Buy This Unusably Slow Lens,"This lens is bad. Not horrible, cuz Canon doesn't make horrible lenses. But considering the other offerings available for the same, less or slightly more money, buying this lens should only become an option if its price point drops to twenty or thirty dollars and then only as a backup. It just isn't worth more money than that.At 3.5-5.6 it is veeeeeery slow. If you are taking photos indoors, it is unusably slow. Buy the IS version if you need a wide angle zoom. Or for a hundred fifty bucks more than the IS version of this, buy the tamron or sigma f/2.8 wide angle zooms. Much better build qualities than this lens and faster as well."
3,Not a $229.99 Lens!!!,"This is an adequate lens but the new kit lens (Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS) for the 450D/Rebel XSi sells for $137.80 on its own...and that lens has image stabilization! Looking at the prices for the 400D/Rebel XTi with and without this lens, the price for this lens is around $40-$80.The folks who are selling this lens at this price must be laughing pretty hard each time they make a sale."
4,"Great songs, 70's audio quality leaves room for improvement.","A nostalgic blast from the past! Experienced this amazing band 2 decades ago and time has not diminished their freshness and punk attitude. Highly recommend this cd for all punks and rock and rollers of all ages who want an authentic slice of punk pie. Sit still if you can and play very loud...thats a necessary requirement! Amaze your friends and neighbors with your unbelievable coolness and cynical wit. I've got the original 45, bet you don't! Anybody know where these guys are? At least we have their music on disc finally to remind us that true punk is not dead!"
3,Not the Christian band from IL ....,"To those looking for the Christian band, strong in the late 90s--this isn't them."
4,Hard to put down!,"This is a wonderful book written in a format that is hard to put down. It just really helps you to think about and evaluate your own life. The purpose of this is to find out what's getting in the way of your witnessing and how to make it better. He shares many comversations he's had, I just wish he would have put what came of them in the book. It's a great buy and a wonderful motivator!"
4,Excellent Content,"I have read this book several times and have purchased it for friends to read as well and led a book study for this book as well.This is one of several books I would recommend for someone in Christian ""sub culture"" and is burned out by it."
4,Post-reading,"I must say, it took me a long time to finish this book (I skip around different books). The beginning and middle of this book didn't exactly jump off the page for me. However, the last two chapters of this were cut-throat and I had to get up and grab a highlighter. I will definately quote Matthew Paul Turner for his words on a personal and loving evangelism.This book surely belongs in the Relevant Books catagory. It focuses on being modern-day evangelists without being biased or sarcastic. I enjoyed this book very much and will recommend it to my college friends. Thank you very much Mr. Turner!"
5,one of my favorite artists,"I first heard Gor in 2004 on an internet radio channel when i was living in the Caucasus and tracked down his CD's. Fantastic is the only word for all of his albums. I love the mix of music styles, tempos. Banjo and Armenian music, who would have thought? But it's perfect. The songs are really honest, evocative and enduring. He's got a beautiful voice to boot. Four years later and I'm still listening.The history of the band is very cool as well.110/100!apres."
3,Good predecessor,"This is a good effort from a great effort that is worth purchasing. You may not be able to find anotherone in hard print like this, but you can contact MPJ about downloading it from a i-tunes eqsue site. Very solid overall album. You can definately see where ""Throwing Punches in the Dark"" came from. Great musician here."
5,deeply moving,"I am much more of a thinker than a feeler, yet MPJ's lyrics and music pull me into the realm of the heart. His songs connect with that place of distress, then lift your spirit with true perspective and inspiring hope. This CD is an all-time favorite and I can't wait for it to be available so I can buy it again! (first one was lost in a fire)"
5,Excellent,"I received the book much sooner than I had expected, and was very pleased with the book and the shipping time."
4,Good Robert Ryan Western,"Big screen western with good cast and interesting story line. Lawman Ryan is nicked in a gun fight and starts to have vision problems that inhibits his ability to deal with the bad guys. He has to rely on the son of a man he killed in a questionable gunfight in his past to aid him when the going gets tough. Robert Ryan is fine as the town lawman, and Jeffrey Hunter gives an adequate pre Searchers performance as the offspring of the man Ryan killed. The great Walter Brennan is all but waisted in a small role as deputy as is Arthur O'Connel. Villan Robert Middleton as always, is smooth and greasy and provides the worthy evil advisary whom Ryan has had past run ins with. All in all, not a classic, but an intersting and satisfyingly entertaining western film footnote. I'd rate as 3.5 stars but will round up in deference to the release of the film on DVD."
4,Fine western for its era,"Other reviewers have rightfully noted the excellent performance of Robert Ryan in this picture. Jeffrey Hunter is less impressive, which is a shame, since his role in The Searchers was proof that he was capable of good acting.This movie features some fairly good action for its day, including what might be the earliest example of a bullet hole appearing in a bad guy's head (actually, his hat). By the 60s, this had become a commonplace, but here it is another example of how film-makers were scrounging around for inventive ways to film gunfighting.Look also for the Ryan's character's criticism of the profit-motive on the part of the townspeople, actually calling them thieves (They were raising their prices to take advantage of the recently paid cowpokes.). This is particularly interesting, given Ryan's real-life liberal political opinions.This movie is a keeper for our household."
3,Ryan in a rare role,"The late Robert Ryan rarely played sympathetic characters since he was usually relegated to the vicious, bigoted villain you'd loved to hate. This fine little B-western was an exception. In this film and later in ""Lawman"", he plays an ageing marshall who is slowly losing his sight and knows his days as a lawman are numbered. He is looking forward to retiring with lady love (a gorgeous Virginia Mayo) but the evil forces of the town won't let him until one day a young man (Jeffrey Hunter) rides into town with thoughts of revenge toward Ryan. How he confronts his dilemna with Hunter and Robert Middleton as an evil saloon owner is intriguing to watch. If you are like me, and am a fan of this greatly under-rated actor--you'll like this little Western."
4,The Proud Ones DVD,A very good Western with Robert Ryan perfectly cast. The enhanced 2.35:1 color picture is sharp and clear.
5,Excellent bluegrass Christmas songs!,"This album is VERY much bluegrass... so if you don't like the style, you'll not like it.But if you do love the style- it's wonderful!It's not only good- it's got 18 songs! Of late, so many Christmas albums have had only 30 minutes or so of music- not this one!It's a great assortment of classics and originals, so for bluegrass fans, it's got breadth, including some serious earworms.Highly recommended for bluegrass fans!"
2,"Disappointing, and not very blue topaz.","Overall these are disappointing. First, the length is smaller than advertised, under 1 3/16 inches, that is about 30mm, as compared to the advertised 35 mm in the product specifications table. More importantly, unlike the photo, the ""blue"" topaz is so pale as to look white rather than blue. The result is that the stone blends in so completely with the silver that it is essentially invisible except under very close up examination. In fact, at first I thought there was no stone at all.On the plus side, they are fairly sturdy and feel like good quality, but I shall have to make an emergency trip to the mall for a different gift."
4,"Nice quality, good price at the time.","Nice quality, good price at the time. Bought these a as gift for my daughter, she wears them frequently."
3,Good but....,"Good product, well made but a tad too big and stiff for me. I like a nail apron to wear while doing housework and yard work, carry my phone, clippers, and misc things while doing tasks and keep my hands free. This is almost perfect, maybe after I wash a few times it will soften up and become more useful. If I was a construction worker on the job site this would have probably gotten 5 stars."
4,Good product slight flaws,Pouch was what I expected. Only issues being the belt doesn't adjust as small as I'd like it to and a lot of loose threads near the top back of it.
2,this is the smallest apron I've ever seen,this is the smallest apron I've ever seen. I'm a window tinter of 10yrs and this apron is tiny no room for tools. knives kept falling out etc...
5,This will never go out of style,This nail apron is a replacement for one my husband used every day for many years and wore it completely out to thread bare. He recently retired after 44 years as a union electrician and even though he's not working every day this nail apron was something he will continue to use. The new apron is equal in quality and workmanship as his original. There are some tools from his career he just won't do without.
3,Nice but.....,"This is a decent pouch for when you just don't want to have the standard double pouches around your waist. I use it for finish work. The only problem with this that I see is the pencil slots are in such a place where if you have a pencil any longer 5 inches in place, it will either certainly snap when bending forward, or the pencil will poke you pretty in the gut.Other than that the pouches are deep enough to comfortably hold a 16' tape, small combo square, knife, and whatever else you have of similar size."
3,Insights: Serious and Fun,"Why has not the New York Times reviewed this book?Here is why:Ms. Sheraton is a former NYTimes employee; the Times even published her restaurant review book.She tells a lot; perhaps not all, I'm sure; but enough to learn about how newspaper management attempts to influence a journalist even on the level of restaurant reviews.Very interesting; but here is the real point of the book:Ever wanted to enjoy ""behind the scenes"" anecdotes direct from, quite probably, the nation's most famous restaurant critic?Great foodie stories; learn some interesting dining, cooking ideas and definitely get a few chuckles.This book just inspired my dinner this evening!"
3,Junior Trivial Pursuit,"I ordered this game on the secondary market because it is no longer manufactured by Hasbro. My 7-1/2 year old Swiss grandson and I played the game 3 times before it was stolen from our car in Italy. He was intrigued with it but it was a rather dated version and I was disappointed that a more recent addition wasn't available as a board game. However, 5 stars to Amazon and the vendor who sent it to me within a couple days of the order. The game was in good condition as promised."
3,Disappointing,This DVD is such a disappointment. I have followed this group for years. The sound quality is dismal.
5,Praises to God,"You Are Not Alone In A Lonely World by Diane Chamberlain is a book everyone should read. This book is written from the author's heart as she pours out the many years she's dealt with surgery after surgery and the endless pain she continues to endure.Throughout her life she's often questioned God's Master Plan for her life. She now realizes she was put here on earth to write and be an encouragement to others who may be experiencing the same things she does or hurt of a different kind.You'll quickly notice that Mrs. Chamberlain is eager to give praise to God daily for all things in her life, though her physical pain is almost unbearable at times. This book is one everyone will enjoy and be able to relate to because we've all suffered pain and illness at some point in our own life.Order your copy today. Read how God continues to bless one of His children and how she continues to give Him the praise He so richly deserves.Pat Brannon, Author of Walk Softly (You're Steppin' On My Heart!)"
3,Barbara Steele.....,"actually Barbara Steele is in 2 vignettes, which are wonderful ...but do remember, the photo of her on the box, is no where to be found in either vignette.....save your money and if you hunt for it you will find it way cheaper, this price is a joke..."
1,AWFUL QUALITY - BAD BAD BAD TRANSFER,"THIS DVD IS ABSOLUTE CRAP QUALITY - WORSE THAN AN AGED VHS!THE SOUND ONLY COMES OUT OF THE LEFT SPEAKER - AND IS NASTY QUALITY THROUGHOUT. AND...THE CREDITS ARE CUT OFF, THEY DIDNT RECORD IT ONTO THE DVD PAST ""IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE""TOTALLY USELESS DVD"
4,The Black 6 With Football's Mean Joe Green,"Unlike the other review, we had NO problems with sound quality. This movie may seem like a ""Bootleg"" or a bad copy to some. You have to consider that the movie orginally only came on VHS or Hi-Fi reel to reel. this is the first movie that mean Joe Green acted in and it shows in some areas. As a foorball fan and a fan of this area of movies. I give it a 4 out of 5."
3,Would be better if it had clear doors!,"I don't personally own this product but my best friend has one of them. I have over 300 CD's & I can't imagine opening & closing that many doors to find what I'm looking for.I did like that they had alot of double CD slots. Because I have over 30 double CD's: Myst2 & 3, G.Knight 2 &3, Phant. 1 & 2, the longest Journey, Leisute Suite Larry collection, Kings Quest Collection *I could go one* =)"
3,For Neat Freaks,"I am a neat and clean person, I like my CDs with that just purchased look, so this storage cabinet was right for me. It has an easy close front, however the front is not transparent so that is an issue when you have five of these cases to look through. Also the fact that there are six slots for double discs, for every thirty discs no one has six double discs. The latch as well is sort of loose and flimsy like it will break six months from now."
5,Obscure. Funky. Eclectic. Indie.,"I heard these guys on SXSW site and was impressed enough to buy this, their first(?), CD. This is a most excellent album. It reminds me a little of bands like Phantom Planet and Deathray- complex power-pop. Much credit goes to bassist Jesse Ingallis and drummer JJ Johnson for keeping it funky. Interesting recording.[DW]"
5,Hard to describe ... but amazing,Saw these guys at the Viper Room tonight. They were impressively noisy.
5,Love this lure,I have not had time to use these yet but I have used the same lures in the past and they were great.
5,Our favorite crank bait!,"This is our favorite lure. We always have good luck and have caught many smallies, walleye and a few northern."
3,batteries not included,"My only complaint on this product is that it would not run long on batteries, I brought the expensive batteries with the charger and it would not hold a charge very long. Otherwise the delivery and appearance of the item was perfect. Yes! I would order from them again."
4,Great video and there's more,"I have seen all her videos and I think that they are very good. If you want to learn from the basics these are great. Her other tapes get more adavnced. I would recomend her other videos as well, Salsa-Merenge-1-2-3 is my favorite."
2,A big disappointment,"There are so many salsa instruction videos and DVDs to choose from - I bought this video based on the rave reviews it got. What a disappointment. Content aside, the quality is poor, particularyly the audio as Josie decided to dub over her counting 1-2-3, 4-5-6 with 1-2-3, 5-6-7 according to the beat count rather than step count. She really shouldn't have. It's very annoying. As for the steps, many of them are identical steps but with arm variations. The music is the same throughout. There are more titles than dancing. Don't get me wrong, there are steps to be learned here but for a fairly experienced dancer (albeit in ballroom) like myself who is looking for a quick overview to get a feel for the style, it's awful."
5,First graders love this book!,"As a former first grade teacher, I can tell you that this was a favorite of both children and teacher. The humor, sorrow (when he loses his cat) and joy (when he finds it) made this a book that was chosen over and over."
1,Problems with Kindle Edition,"Whilst I really appreciate the contents of the book and its contribution to Trinitarian Theology I want to warn Kindle users about some problems I encountered with this book in its Kindle edition. I find the typeface or font VERY POOR. The book is really difficult to read both in my Kindle and in my MAC. After wondering what happended I spent some time studying the font and even though I am no expert I discovered that letters are not complete: there are tiny white spaces in the typography which difficult the reading and tire the reader. Also I founnd quite a few ""typos"" uncomplete words, or words that are wrongly separated in syllables... I urge Amazon to re issue the Kindle version in a nicer font. My very poor rating does NOT refer to the content, but to problems with the Kindle version."
5,Delmar's Pharmacy Technician Book,"I really like this book! I was told it would take over a month to receive this book and instead I received it way faster. I have been really busy and have not been able to read as much as I would like; but what I have read, I am really impressed."
5,Passed with just this book,"I'm a computer professional wanting to make a career change to pharmacy. So I'm really a clean slate - and have little to no pharmacy biases whatsoever.I bought this book and studied it - and was able to pass my CPhT exam the very first time.My only training and experience has always been in IT; I've never filled a prescription (yet). Because I'm about to make a career change, I needed a way to prove to health care employers I was serious. So getting my CPhT was a great way to do that. If there's a test-case for how good this book is - then I'm it.Important Note: the new second-edition will soon be released. The ISBN is 0766814327. Make sure to get the latest one before ordering.Good luck on your exam!"
3,Just took the Pharm. Tech. Cert. Exam,"(2nd edition). This book was good but had the potential to be an exceptional one-source study guide for the PTCExam if it wasn't for the mathematical errors, typos, etc. On one math question, the variables were different between the question and the answer/explanation (The question wanted you to fill an order for 0.5g of a drug from a supply of 200mg /5ml solution. The answer was based on 0.75mg of drug from a 250mg /5ml supply). This was frustrating at times, especially since I purchased this book primarily for the math review.The book is laid out very well, and covers quite a lot of information. It is pretty up to date on state and fed. regulations such as the April 2003 HIPAA revisions.It's too bad it wasn't proof read very well. Overall, this book is still a usefull study guide for the exam as long as you look out for the mathematical errors. With this book's help, I do believe (and hope!) I passed the exam."
1,Has potential... needs editing,I'm presently going through a certification program and my class uses this book. There are so many errors and typos. My teacher had to correct many of them for us just so we can make sense of the information. This book needs a new editor. Do not waste your money.
3,Good good good Good good goooooooooooooooood good h g g g g o o o o d d d d good good go,GoodGood good good Good good goooooooooooooooood good h g g g g o o o o d d d d good good go
2,Very Outdated,This book was one used during my classroom training for Pharmacy Technicians and it is Very Outdated now. I don't think there is enough detailed information in this book to thoroughly understand the concepts and variety of drug classifications.
1,NO NO NO NO!!!!,"Don't bother. This book is horrible. There are so many errors in it, and it is very frustrating. The exam questions don't match what the book says, and I had to buy other material. Don't watse your time and money. This is not a good buy in any way!"
3,"Good on the Math, Short on Drug info","I did this review. I knew it. I took the test. I felt that Delmar's was weak on Law/Procedure and on Drugs, their generics, classes, etc...use this book. but make sure you use others"
2,So MANY errors!,"This would have been a great tech review if it weren't for the NUMEROUS typographical errors present! In one chapter alone I found 5 math typos!! Its pretty bad when you can't trust your answer page to be correct! The information learned from this text book would have been so much more helpful if I hadn't had to spend so much time decifering their errors! I wish someone would have proof read this before it went to print! Luckily I have a great pharmacist willing to quiz me so hopefully I can still pass! If I'd had to depend only on this book I would be in some serious trouble! And for as much as this darn thing costs, you'd think they could at least have gotten the ""solutions for problems"" right!! Look into getting a different review book--not this one! Its not worth the money!"
2,"Good for math, but not much else","I ran into a lot of problems using this book. Numerous answers are wrong, questions often involve information that hasn't been taught yet, the drug list is incomplete and vague, and when I actually took the test there were a number of subjects that the book never even mentioned (such as proper DEA form numbers). If you are having problems with the algebra or conversions involved in pharmacy, this book might help, but I would advise looking elsewhere for technical information. I'm probably going to have to take the test again."
3,Poor,"This book has a lot of useful information, but using it as a go-by book for a study tool is a very poor idea. There are so many errors in it that I had to look up the questionable information in other reference guides, which makes it difficult to take anything out of it since you have to double-check all of the information in it. You should be able to trust a text book, and this one does not fulfill it's duty that way. Some of the info contradicts itself within two lines of stating the opposite, and when checking the answers for chapter questions some are wrong,some have the correct answer and the wrong letter, and others don't even answer the correct question. I do not recommend this edition."
2,Mistakes a plenty,This book has Clark's rule wrong. The copy I saw was published in 2000. I hope it has been corrected but it is a textbook and it was not proof read. It was not a typo because it was repeated throughout the book. Inexcusable.
4,Case Logic-al Solution,"The Case Logic CD60 case is extremely versatile - carry CDs of every description with or without the jewel cases! I have owned several of the CD30 cases in the past, and this one lives up to Case Logic's outstanding reputation for quality products."
5,CaseLogic CD Case,"One of the few cases that accepts up to 60 jewel cases. If you need that feature, this is a good product at a reasonable price."
4,Great case....nice size for the car,This is a nice care to hold CD's. Nice size so you do not have them all over the place.
3,Not par with otrher case logic products,"I found this case somewhat diasappointing. It's a useful size and organizes cds well, but it's not very substanital: has no padding and only a thin fabric shell. It is essentially a bag with 2 plastic cd organizers in it.What I'd hoped for was something similar with some padding, or the nice heavy material case logic uses in it's envelopes, books and other cd cases. This is not up to par with other products from this company.That said, it was surprisingly difficult to find a portable cd organizer which stores cds in their cases. That it does. So if that's what you need, and you can't find a suitable substitue, this will work, Just don't expect it to be the same quality as their other products, or you will be disappointed (as I was)."
2,The shoulder strap is missing.,The shoulder strap on the 60 CD case logicCase Logic CD60 Nylon CD Case (60-Capacity)is missing. I guess I need to return it in order to get the order right.
1,CD Case,Excellent case. Hard to find!! You are able to keep the jewel case & the liner notes with the CD. A lot larger than I thought but big enough to keep most of my CDs. I then bought the 30 capacity model to keep in the truck.
3,The book was o.k.,"I am an avid Nora Roberts/J D Robb fan, but this book was predictable and lack luster. This was one of a very few that I have read by Nora Roberts that I struggled to finish."
3,"OK Read, Good Series","Fourth of six in Roberts' Stanislaski series, the warm-hearted, hot-blooded and gorgeous Ukranian-American family.This was my least favorite, primarily because I didn't care for the hero. He has always been the least featured of the siblings, and I didn't think he really brought anything noteworthy to his own story. The heroine was engaging enough, and I liked her work as a soap opera writer. I didn't really buy their HEA, because if nothing else, the end proved he really doesn't know her that well.Also, while Roberts does an incredible job as JD Robb now, at this point in her career (and probably the fact that this is ""only"" a Category Romance), the cynical cop tracking down a serial killer didn't really play for me.But as always, the large family scenes and the various relationships and interactions were pure pleasure, and I look forward to the next book."
3,Cheap piece of plastic,"OK, don't misunderstand, it does what it is supposed to and that is conceal wires. It comes with 2 large screws that which may be overkill as the product needs to just stay on the wall and is not weight bearing.But I kind of expected more than two 6 inch pieces of plastic for $12.99. If you want to run the cable concealer down the wall to the floor then you will need a few. Heck at $12.99 per it can cost you more than the TV mount!"
3,Nothing fancy,"A little pricey for was is essentially 4 pieces of plastic. There is no way to lock the pieces together to form one long tunnel, so make sure you line it up right. Still, for my application it worked fine."
3,Very nice,"I could totally appreciate what this book was trying to do: tell the tale of how a mother hummingbird built a nest on the author's patio and raised two chicks.The story is told via poetry and with some lovely drawings. There's also an explanation of how the book came about, as well as fun facts about hummingbirds.Only trouble is that the poetry wasn't always that great, and varied in style (and perspectives). Also, I found myself having to piece things together more than I probably should have had to. It's still interesting and a sweet idea, but it could have been so much better."
3,Natural,It was a quick delivery and the product is nice just takes some getting use to the squeakiness ur mouth feels after u brush.
4,Its pretty good.,"This is a great teaching tool. However, I do have a problem with how fast he teaches. What I mean is that I can be trying to practice something he just told me to and before I know it he's already gone through two more lessens while I was just working at it about five minutes. Plus because of his much larger hands it tough to see where to put my smaller fingers to play."
3,OK for an absolute beginner,"Purchased this DVD when I started getting back into learning to play after many years away from the guitar. It is just OK for an absolute beginner, but barely gets you started on learning basic techniques. The video is very short - and about as exciting as watching paint dry - so short is probably a good thing. If you are serious about learning to play - I would recommend theFender Presents: Getting Started on Electric Guitar -- A Guide for BeginnersDVD. The Fender DVD is over 3 times the length for just a little more money and covers a lot of ground - and the instructor is much easier to watch."
5,Simone Hawke can really fill in the Details,I really Enjoyed this Book. I am Starting to read the series for the second time. I really like the way the battle seens get so graphic. I recomend it over any Dragonlance or ForgottenRealms books. It is a must read.
3,The Nomad,"This book had a lot of potential but falls short. The author, Simon Hawke, reuses several scenarios from the previous volumes in this trilogy. This makes it seem as if he did not plan out the book very well and just needed something to bring the characters to the next step of the story. There was a lot of good build up to the climax of the trilogy but then the reader is let down by the anti-climatic end. The end was a big let down and felt like the writer was just trying to finish the trilogy because they grew tired of writing it."
4,"The Nomad is a good addition of the ""Tribe of One"" trilogy.","The book reads at a flying pace and it is important because it developes from the the first two books in this trilogy. It is very detailed, there should of been more fighting sequences at the end of the book. The death of the character Valsavis at the end left the reader wanting more from such a build-up of conflict at the begining of the book"
2,It leaked the first minute,"I received it brand new on June 12, 2009, checked the oil and turned it on. It compressed fast and I let it stand without connecting any hoses to check for leaks, as I could hear sound between the pump and the tanks. Sure enough, within minutes the pump came on. Called Ingersoll, they gave me a number and address for a local local repair shop, yet to take it there. Disconnected from the power source and let it stand over night. By early next morning, it dropped from 125 psi to under 20. Disappointed by IR?? Yes!!!! Home Depot would have been better.Update, June 22. Took it to the repair shop on Monday, June 15. It took them until Friday 4:00 p.m. to call me that they tightened some connectors and sealed other joints. Picked it up before 5 p.m. Compressed it to 125 psi. By 6:30 a.m. on Saturday it was down to 40 psi. Called the shop and Ingersoll. The shop said to take it back to them. I'll post an update after the second visit to the shop."
2,ingersall rand dd2t2,"i recieved my compressor after my old one was recalled. i had to pay [...] to them and everything else was free(picking up old unit and shipping new one). when it arrived i plugged it in and it vibrated so bad that it would walk all over the place. it walked around one time and rested against the wall and rubbed a hole in my hose.Now the vibration broke the welds on the handle and the id plate(which also holds the 2 tanks together).and now the regulator leaks all the time. it use to hold air for over a month, now 2 hours.i think the motor is good and airs up quickly but i am more disatisified than happy."
1,Not A 100% Duty Cycle - False advertising,"The previous reviewer was correct. I called IR and they said that for this product 100% meant there was air in the tank 100% of the time. This is not the industry definition of duty cycle - actual duty cycle is no better than other brands. Also I went to their website and pulled up the Manual and it said the compressor could not be operated if temperatures are less than 32 degrees. Pretty worthless to a contractor in ""North"" america. [...]Check out this Makita - a much better unit for the money [...]"
4,Not bad,Not two bad if you need it for an EMERGENCY use! Would not keep it for shop use!!! I've had other expensive pieces of !@#$ and this one really impressed me.
4,"Good, lightweight pump.","Works well, the handle is not the most sturdy, but it doesn't feel like it'll fall apart on me. Wish it came with a presta valve adapter though."
5,One of the best the group put out,"Lesser known than others Heart produced, but more substance and nuance; there seems to be less thought to ""what will hit the charts?"" and more to ""what will hit the soul?"""
4,Good sound,"For a used CD it sounds pretty good, Would try more of their products. Would recommend this to my friends."
3,Not so great.,This cd wasn't that interesting to me. I have heard better from them. I think their greatest cd is Dreamboat Annie. If you listen to this cd and then listen to Dreamboat Annie you will hear a remarkable difference. I feel they put alot more time and effort in their earlier cd's.
1,DEAD ANIMALS,"DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE A POPPER. The last Heart casette I bought. They did what I never thought they would do try to repeat a previous album, that album was the brilliant Eponymus album. This was their clone and it wasn't even fully formed. Unfortunately Heart is not like IRON MAIDEN. When IRON MAIDEN makes a bad album, it is only bad by MAIDEN standards, IE it is still good. This is why anything past the ""HEART"" album I do not buy, unless I hear the whole content first, and like it. THIS IS SO NOT MY JAZZ."
1,Just Bad And Not Michael Jackson Bad,"I'm sorry-when Heart embraced blatant commerciality following their successful resurrection on MTV, they left earthiness and solid songwriting behind for a plastic, radio-friendly hit-based sound. They totally lost me on most of that. This CD is probably the worst of that period. Get ""Little Queen"" or ""Bebe Le Strange"" or any of their earlier works."
4,Beautiful Music,"This album which was released in 1987, was one of the albums made a big change in Heart's music. It had become soft but beautiful music. These girls (and guys) had no trouble to show their softer side. The songs like ""Alone"" and ""RSVP"" indicate that the personal feelings are important in life as well as in music. Yes, they might sound as tough as in ""Little Queen"" or ""Dreamboat Annie"", someone would say that they have changed. I disagree with that. They still have rocking songs such as ""Easy Target"" and ""Bad Animals"". I like this quite much because it has beautiful songs but I still find ""Little Queen"" as my favorite album although albums like this and ""Brigade"" are very good.Stars: Alone, Who Will You Run to, There's the Girl"
3,*** 1/2 A step back.,"Heart ""Bad Animals"" #2 (1987).After the Mega selling ""Heart"", they release ""Bad Animals"", another strong seller, in 1987. You get the rockin' ""Who Will You Run To"", #7 hot 100 and #2 MSR. The power ballad ""Alone"" their second #1 and #3 MSR, still holds up today. ""There's The Girl"", #12 hot 100 #16 MSR, very synth heavy. ""I Want You So Bad"", #49 hot 100 , not a favorite. ""Bad Animals"" and ""Easy Target' strong hard rockers 1990 brought us their weakest album ever in ""Brigade""."
4,Nice Follow Up,"It is a good follow-up to their 1985 masterpiece ""Heart"". First three hit tracks are really excellent, making the album easy to listen to. It also has memorable non-hit tracks such as ""I Want You So Bad""""Love Is The Endless Fight"". Ron Nevison known by the excellent production in Survivor, Kiss, Ozzy Osbourne and Damn Yankees masterpieces as well as hitmaking songwriters really did an excellent job. Recommended for 80's pop rock fans.@"
4,Useful manual,"I found this book good, up to a point. I suppose the limitations are by design. There are more complete manuals available, but they are much thicker and much more expensive. The best way I can illustrate the book's limits is with an example. I wanted to investigate a broken outer door handle. The book gave me all the detail I needed to remove panels, links, etc. in the right order to get to the handle. But it did not have any information on how a properly working handle's connections should look nor what could be fixed vs. replaced. Also, it would be very simple to add information about bolt sizes to the text. It would be nice to know in advance, before tearing into a car, whether you have the right size tools for the job. Still, the illustrations are pretty good and the general flow of how to perform tasks is accurate and complete, as far as it goes."
2,"Short and not a true watercolor book, but a craft book","I was disappointed about this book. It has craft projects that include watercolor, instead of just watercolor techniques."
3,Occasionally President Carter strikes gold,"For those who have wanted to attend President Jimmy Carter's Sunday School class in Plains, Georgia, but couldn't make it, Sources of Strength sits you in the front row. Fifty-two Bible teachings make up this primer, and occasionally President Carter strikes gold and gives us insight into both scripture and his world view. Yet, most of the time, the lessons are basic Christianity 101, often pedantic and vanilla.His sections titled ""Christians in the World"" has five teachings that take him out of his Sunday School teacher role and place him on the stage as a statesman and Christian. It is in these sections when writing on ""human rights and human needs"" that he speaks ""as one with authority"". Conditionally Recommended."
5,ATHORS REVIEW,i COAUTHORED THIS BOOK WITH CHUCK HAMPTON (NOW DECEASED) IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS ON THIS BOOK PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH YOUR QUESTIONS.
4,Must read before marriage....,"If you are dating or engaged, please read this book. At church we kept hearing how great this book was because there was a class for engaged couples that was going through this book together. I purchased it after we were married and I still enjoyed it and learned. My husband and I recommend this book."
3,Not worth the reading effort....,"This book is great if one is solely interested in how the relationship between Elisabeth and Jim Elliot evolves and grows. Ms. Elliot's comments about leaving oneself open to God is a good concept to follow in any area of life. However, her advice on dating relationships was peculiar to her own experience, and wouldn't work in all situations. An interesting read if one is interested in other people's romantic involvments, but highly idealistic and impractible to those looking for honest and workable advice on Christian dating matters."
4,Read it when you have the time,"The book has amazing insight, and is truly written of a verypersonal, intimate walk with Christ. But it is also very difficult toread. Because of excerpts from the Bible, her diary, and little poems, the book does not flow well if you're interested in just reading it to get the general idea. To get full benefit from the book, you need to have many hours to spend, slowly sifting through the book and absorbing the information. Certainly there are no ""quick fixes"" for relationships in here. (In fact, I might go so far as to say that the book explicity denounces that whole plan.)"
4,"Overwhelming, but worth the read!","When I first started to read this book, I have to say that I was completely overwhelmed. Elisabeth Elliot is absolutely amazing in her dedication to being a Christian woman. At first, I saw her situation as being so far removed from my own life that I couldn't even relate to the advice. However, as I now am reading parts of the book for the second time, I realize that the story of love and sacrifice can be applied to all of us. Elisabeth Elliot's book can be used as a wonderful example of pursuing a Godly relationship, and has motivated me a lot for my future. The scripture passages throughout the book are also very helpful and applicable for me. I definately recommend any Christian read this book, it will motivate you and show you how pure a relationship can be."
1,"E. Elliott gives guidelines how to live her life, not yours","Elisabeth Elliott's book is about how SHE decided to follow God in the area of relationships in her life. She does not offer much advice in finding your own path in relationships and automatically assumes her way is the only way in dating, finding potential mates and being engaged. This book is not a book of the Bible and should not be treated as such. If you want to authentically live out Elisabeth's life, rather than your own, follow the advice of this book."
1,disappointed,"I was excited when I got this book as a recommendation from Joshua Harris' ""I kissed Dating Goodbye"". After the first 15mins I grew restless and disappointed. I tried in keeping an open mind and heart as I flipped through rest of the pages, time after time, I found myself falling asleep to it. I concur with some of the other comments, Elliot's advice on courtship is impractical for the amass of this generation. Maybe tis' not the season for me to read this book, perhaps God did anoited Elliot with the gift of testimony and relationship wisdom, but I just didn't benefit from it.Different generations have different styles of courtship and marriage. In the old testaments, girls usually get married around the age of 15-17, and most of those marriages were arranged. Would this apply to us today?"
1,A flat out BORING book-not very edifying.,"I read this book not too long ago and it was simply boring! Ms. Elliot attempts to proove her points by basically giving us her life story. To make matters worse her style of writing is a dry as the Sahara Desert.Bottom line: DO NOT waste your $$$ on this book.If you're intent on reading an Elliot book, then I would have to reccommend Quest For Love. That book is far superior to PP and has some great tips in it."
1,This book is an embarrassment to Christian women everywhere,"This book is one of the most misogynistic pieces of literature I have ever read. Although I grew up in a conservative Southern Baptist family, I was angered and repulsed by this book. Elliot argues that women are to be ""passive"" and men ""active,"" that God does not want a women to call a man on the phone or to go out on a date alone. Is this the kind of God you want to believe in? Elliot's sexist point-of-view will teach your daughters to be quiet and submissive instead of proud and self-confident. Learn to think for yourselves, American women. Elliot's book is pure rubbish."
2,Pretty dated by now. Need something fresher.,"I suppose Ms. Elliot's book was good for young people from thirty years ago, but the other reviewers are right - it's pretty dated, and most of us would prefer something newer that understands the modern world and doesn't seem stuck in the 50s. True Love in a World of False Hope is better than this or Kissed Dating Goodbye, and Singles at the Crossroads is pretty good too."
1,I would have given it zero stars,"I was looking for books for pre-teenaged girls. I had never heard of Elisabeth Elliot before. If I had I wouldn't have wasted my money on this piece of garbage. I have since learned that her politics are beyond conservative. Supporting the ERA=supporting lesbianism?? Gimme a break! I am a Christian woman and found this book to be outdated and incredibly offensive to both women and men. I don't even know where to start... The ideas presented in this book are just too old fashioned to be applied to real life. Recommended for extreme conservatives and the brain dead ONLY. The girls got a good laugh, though!"
1,Useless for the 21st century,Impractical application for dating in the 21st century. True Love in World of False Hope or something by Michelle McKinney Hammond would be better choices for Christian dating principles.
5,Passion & Purity: Learning to Bring Your Love Life Under Christ's Control,"This book was written for young unmarried women who are in relationships and are not sure how to handle themselves when feelings for ""physical contact"" become overwhelming. I found this book to be very helpful in guiding me while my husband and I were separated. I believe it kept me focused on what was truly important, GOD. Thank you Elisabeth for keeping your journals. Lori"
4,Putting purity before passion.,"I found this book encourging when I was a teen. I strugled with passion in my life and didn't know how to deal with the emotions. I would feel guilty for having sensual thoughts and emotions, especialy because I wanted to feed those emotions not curb them. What this book showed me was that I must decide to commit myself to purity and wait for God's timing to be able to explore those emotions in the context God intended: Marriage!"
2,Know the Bible before you quote it!,"Jesus spoke Aramaic, not Greek. The Bible quoted here was written in Greek by writers who NEVER KNEW JESUS. The Bible also excludes the books from Egypy and the Dead Sea that tell us Jesus was married and a father, and guess what, Mary being a virgin does NOT mean in the physical sense, so learn your terms before your trumpet them. God wants love, not blind, ignorant obediance based on writings from people who never knew Christ. Jesus was married to Mary Magdalen. Read the research with an open mind and learn from it! Otherwise, your write without any expertise."
2,"Helpful, yet painful","The author has a positive attitude and has accomplished what he claims: self-published and sold his book on Amazon.com. He offers helpful ideas about how others can get their self-published books noticed and sold online. These ideas earn two stars; however......their presentation does not. The writing is often painful to read. I found myself urgently wishing the author had taken his own advice and hired a real editor. (I also wish he had brought in a real designer before offering design advice, and a real proofreader before offering proofreading advice.)"
1,Activate spam filter!,"The title of this book wouldn't get past any email spam filter. Unfortunately, the title contains enough keywords to turn up in webdesign-related book search results. Kindly enough, the blasting cover design is a clear warning sign, and the most curious can have a look at the contents at the authors lulu-dot-com page, and see if it seems a worthy investment."
5,Information any author needs to know,"I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to preview this book before it was released, and it is clear that Rising has done his homework. Marketing on the Internet is extremely hard, which I know from firsthand experience. And no amount of marketing will ever help sell a product that's just not any good. But using the techniques and strategies that David Rising discusses in this book will give you the exposure you need to at least have a fair chance in this ever-expanding world of publishing.If you're a small or independently published author, you owe it to yourself to read this book.- Gregory Bernard Banks, author of ""Phoenix Tales: Stories of Death & Life"""
1,Grade A P.O.S.,Unfortunatly you get what you pay for. And if you waste your money on this you'll eventually find out that it cant even take off those stubborn lugs that drove you to buy it in the first place.
4,Good Transparent Labels,We bought these as return address labels for our wedding invitations.They are labels. They work. The ink doesn't rub off. Not the most exciting product in the world but it works!
3,Too bad Ventana got hold of it!,"This book is a solid presentation on print design principles and techniques with great examples -- it has been since Parker's first edition. The CD-ROM is falsely advertised as providing ""examples, templates, tips and shareware."" It has some marginal shareware and overdone advertising for Ventana, period. STRONGLY recommend keeping the older editions."
3,"Good book, faulty CD-ROM","I found this book unused in one of our offices. Apparently purchased a couple of years ago. The content was good to great, many of the ideas are common knowledge to an experienced designer but it's good to have it put all together in one place.Unfortunately the CD-ROM contained only its Windows files and all the Mac content was missing. I wonder if this is the case with all of the first printing ? This is not new to me. I have found other CD-ROMs that claim to have Mac files as well as PC files but somewhere during the production process the Mac stuff gets lost. From my studio, I produce for both platforms and find it hard to believe that more care isn't taken by some publishers.So then, in conclusion... the book is a solid piece of work. Hopefully the cross platform clitch was fixed in the new edition."
4,Fantasy with a heavy touch of comedy,"I found this book a few years ago... It combines 'to demons bound', 'a yoke of magic' and 'blood fountain'.The adventures of thieves Davin Anane and Goran one-eye (who is actually a demon, but hey, we all have our little flaws).Do not expect a book with deep psychology or story-lines. (it's not TOLKIEN). No, this is light reading for those who like fantasy, role-playing and a good laugh... e.g. Goran keeps dishing out stories on how his lost his eye...For those who play RPG's, it has a bit of an AD&D feel to...Only set-back. Book III, Blood-fountain ends like there could be a part IV to this series and there should be..."
3,"Nice, but not great.","Good action, it just didn't work for me. Some parts were a bit vulger, which is fine. It fit the book. It was by no means a bad book."
5,Kohler Revival Toilet Seat is CLASSY,The Kohler Revival Toilet Seat is CLASSY. The seat is constructed of high quality material and simply just looks great with the curve defining the lid. It is much nicer looking than a standard toilet lid.
4,"Almost Perfect, should be whisper-close.",I went though the last 2 years of replacing 5 seats from other manufacturers... especially the Bemis Whisper-Close. I love the Whisper-Close feature but the damned things have only one support lug under each side of the seat... the cheap molded particle board seats always crack! So... I went back to the original factory seat for my Kohler Revival toilet. I forgot how well made it is (reflected by the higher than average price). There are two support lugs under each side of the seat. The lid is VERY heavy though... I've got to teach my son not to drop this lid down!
5,Hamtaro!,This is a cute picture book about a hamster named Hamtaro. He is a birthday present for a girl named Yukari. He learns about humans and about being a pet in a series of short stories. The pictures are adorable and the stories are fun. Hamtaro narrates the stories himself. There is also a little bit of information about real hamsters after every story. This is a good book for little kids and anyone who likes the Hamtaro TV show.
1,New is not new,"I ordered this item as new but what came was a library edition complete with glued on checkout envelope and card and glued on Dewey decimal tag on the spine. Since this was ordered as a gift it was useless to me. The seller did agree to a refund when I returned the book but was unable to get a ""new"" book. I decided against sending review, however since the seller continues to advertise this book as new, I feel obliged to save someone the return postage."
2,The Internet Movie Database Rules!,"The one-line summary I have provided makes the point of what I'm going to quickly say very clear. In my opinion I believe the Internet Movie Database is the best, most concise, witty, and LARGEST (over 80,000 titles!) movie and video guide. What Martin is missing is that it's all just his opinion. Like most critics (Ebert, Leonard Maltin) he tends to believe that he's right and every one else should believe he's right. To accomplish this he uses big and intimidating words to get the less educated readers to believe that he's right and everyone else is wrong. To me he is no different from Halliwell, Leonard Maltin, and Roger Ebert. Go to the IMDB or read VideoHound instead, they're a helluva lot better."
3,Buy it for the index,"I've been buying this book for 10 years now and the one thing that makes it great is the actor/director index. The reviews are occasionally mind boggling (Godzilla 4 stars? Streetfighter 3 stars? Forrest Gump 5 stars? Oh wait...Americans love that movie) but the index is a godsend, however with imd being so good, I might not need this much anymore. One thing is needed badly...a list of new films in the book."
2,Disappointing,"Yes, this is a good alternative to the usuals. BUT many of the new releases at my video stores are not in here--so of what value is this?!"
4,"Really Good, Not Perfect","Yes, it is very comprehensive, overall well-written, and contains basically reliable star-ratings...but not always. I found the rating system stupidly uneven (they give one movie 1 1/2 stars, then seem to forget they can do that on another review and give it that dumb Turkey rating). Personal taste also shines through where it shouldn't sometimes: Scream 2 with 2 stars? That one fired me up. Also, blatant actor name mistakes abound, and there are also a couple errors in the cross-index, as Jennifer Love Hewitt is not listed as being in I Know What You Did Last Summer. Basically, I'm saying the editor could do a better job. Maybe 2000's will be excellent, so I'll be waiting. Even so, this is one of the best on the market, and mine is already falling apart from constant use."
3,Go with Maltin,"This is just a glorified tv guide listing. Only tells you the basics. Maltin tells you who plays whom in some cases, behind the scenes info like cameos, debuts, awards, etc. Sure his reviews aren't that great as a whole but he gives you more information then name, year and running time."
4,the most worn-out book I'v got.,"I've been reading/using mick and marsha's guide for the past 8 years. In a world full of TV and cinema like todays, it's a must for anybody who's tired of the one word reviews most papers give you. Exceptional value, exceptional information. One drawback, though - a year ago they changed the indexing method and it takes longer now to find a movie by it's title."
2,Critic of the Critics,"One of the most boring novels I've ever read. There was no plot, just a bunch of movies I've never seen. What no life has this much time to watch this many movies? I just hope they don't make a movie on this book of movies."
5,Great - entertains and stimulates baby,"When our son was really small, we used it with the vibrate setting to sooth him. Later he started noticing the lights and giggled to the music. Eventually he figured out that kicks activates the music and now he goes wild kicking and LOVES it. This is a great entertainment and educational toy."
3,gift for baby not born yet,Please note that my review is done on a product that I purchased as a gift for a baby shower and has not been removed from the box as of this email. The receptient was happy to have gotten this as a gift tho. Maybe in two more months the review could be done as to how it was working. Thank you.
5,Great Bouncer,"I selected this bouncer based on reviews from other parents who said their babies loved it - thankfully mine does too! She loves to kick her legs and watch the bears ""dance"" and play. She'll wait for the song to end and then kick again to watch the show - she's three months now and loves it but cried every time I added the toy bar for the first couple of months...it was still very helpful, she would sit or sleep in the chair with the vibration on while I showered or did the dishes, etc. In the last three months I have also only had to replace the vibration battery once (the vibration uses a different battery than the lights/music) because a friend left it on over night - we use it every day so I am pretty happy with that."
5,Excellent product,"If you are even a semi-regular baker with recipes that call for candied fruit peel (or you happen to throw candied fruit peels into everything including your morning coffee and thai curry just because they taste good), you have also realized that the baking section in most grocery stores now consists of atrocious ""mixes"" where you ""just add water and bake"" or poisonous looking icing tubes. Even if you have the good luck to find a store which actually sells real candied fruit, the prices are more in line with those of Italian truffles. The candied diced lemon peel from Barry Farms is excellent quality, delicious and priced reasonably. I am coming back for more the moment I am done baking with the current box."
1,Bad News,"Bad news for Dan Hicks fans: this has got to be the most embarassingly lame recording he's ever made. Some things grow on you; this one does not. The vocals are terrible, the collaborations even worse and the remakes of previous tunes are tedious head scratchers. What was he thinking about when he listened to the out-takes? Does he need money? A second listening inspired only a desire to get the shrink-wrap back on. Sorry Dan, this one should have never been born."
1,...,"The book was an obvious ploy to try to turn the readers opinion in the favor of Darlie Routier and he is ridiculous in his wording, pleading and groveling style. I thought her guilty before and this book only firmed up my opinion...."
1,Horrible misleading information,"This book (if you can call it that is horrible). After, reading this book, I'm more convinced than ever that Darlie slaughtered her two children and staged the crime scene. This author goes so far as to name 2 people that have gotten abortions. The author uses sarcasm to make it points, it's extremely irritating."
2,Not worth the wait,I waited over 18 months for this book to come into a more reasonable price range. It wasn't worth the money or the wait. The author's work is very poor and he thinks the reader is interested in his every thought and weak comments. How did this book get published? I really believed this book would help me decide Darlie's guilt or innocence and it didn't. I'm still not sure!
3,Good Book Needed More Time!!,"This book raised many legitimate questions regarding Darlie's innocence. However, grammatical and several other errors damaged it's credibility. It is an interesting book, but more time and thoroughness would have been worth it."
4,JUSTICE FOR DARLIE,PERHAPS NOW PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO SEE ANOTHER SCENARIO ON THE MURDERS OF THE TWO LITTLE ROUTIER BOYS DARLIE WILL FINALLY GET A NEW TRIAL.WHAT ABOUT THE MAN SEEN LEAVING THE HOUSE ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS THAT THE POLICEMAN THOUGHT WAS DARIN?A FASCINATING BOOK AND A MUSTREAD FOR ANY TRUELIFE CRIME FANS.
5,I still don't beleive it,I read the book and looked through all the evidence and I still don't see how this can be true. I don't understand how much more the courts can put this woman through. How she can hold up to all of this is way beyond anything I could do. I have two children myself and I would never be able to hold up and look at things the way Darlie does. My hat goes off and my prayers are with Darlie and her family. True justice will be served one day and God help them all.
1,You call this a book?,"How can someone copy newspaper articles, throw their two cents (which in my opinion is way too much money for this opinion) and add a bunch of gross photos and call it a book? What a waste of time, energy and money on my part for even bothering."
1,One use only ..,"You can pretty much just rip out the entire text portion of this book, it's useless and laughable. The photo section is the eye opening part of this book. By reading the transcript and viewing the photos used in the trial, you can come to your own conclusion regarding this case. Less the childish sarcasm of the author."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!,"This book is the ultimate example that ANYONE can achieve the American Dream, even an idiot or someone with less than a 3rd grade education. I agree with another rater in that it's too bad you can't take stars away for pathetic journalism. If this author does have a valid point to make, it quickly becomes lost amid his sarcasm, pettiness, and horrific abuse of the English language. He provides NO additional evidence, other than some very tasteless photographs, which still give you no insight into who the killer is. The only thing he proved to me, BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, is that he is a total moron who seems to be obsessed with Darlie Routier. A more interesting read, from a REAL author, who presents both sides in a non judgmental format is Hush Little Babies. I'm not convinced that Darlie is the killer, but I'm certainly not convinced she isn't, either (and this book sure didn't answer any of my questions)."
4,never ending story,"I lived in Rowlett during this time and have followed the case since. Regardless of any books, this case is a total ""Texas size"" disaster! I don't know anything about any of your readers but how could anyone look at those photos of her bruises and think she inflicted them on herself! Come on people, use your heads. A noble prize winning newspaper has uncovered that there has been new evidence that proves there is a fingerprint in blood that matched none of the family, friends, officers or paramedics. Hello, can anyone spell I-N-T-R-U-D-E-R. I would guess that this case is far from over and that the Routier's are innocent of any crime. Talk about a messed up bunch of officers, at least back then I know they were!"
2,Book Lacks Credibility,"This book actually gave the reader some good food for thought concerning Darlie Routier's innocence. However, it is difficult to get past the blatant and NUMEROUS spelling, grammatical and syntax errors. And while Mr. Brown complains of inconsistencies and/or contradictions made by the Rowlett Police Department, there are many of his own in the book, some only paragraphs apart. Also, even if the Rowlett Police are as inept as Mr. Brown claims (which is hard to believe), his complete lack of respect for them is disturbing. Again, while Mr. Brown raises valid points that are worth considering, the book seems loaded with his own emotions and/or feelings toward Darlie. Another note: the pictures are very disturbing."
1,No doubt of guilt......,"I believed after reading all the books written about the case that she was guilty. This 'book', (I use the term losely) did nothing to convince me otherwise. I mean lets face it; a mother who has been 'attacked' and has had two of her babies brutally stabbed to death, DO NOT say 8 days later.......""Well, we had some good times with them..."" This is on top of a complete lack of intruder evidence and let's face it...these cops KNOW....when they first start investigating and interviewing....they KNOW deep down if something is inherently wrong with the situation. Anyone who believes otherwise (including Brown) is a shirt-tailer and probably believes O.J. too! Thanks"
1,"Valuable Pictures; ""Lousy Book!""","The state's evidence photos used in this book are valuable for studying this case. That's the only good thing I can say about this book. It's so full of typos, misspelled words, unfinished sentences and sarcasm, I recommend buying it only if you want to look at the pictures and pay for an over-priced book.Christopher W. Brown is just another one of those ""SLOBS"" who comes along and takes advantage of a family-in-crisis. At a recent fund-raiser banquet, he spoke of the donations from this book that will go to Ms. Routier's Defense/Appeals Fund. It would be interesting to know how much he has donated -- if anything. He's a ""USER"" and a ""LOSER."" Too bad the family got taken in by him."
1,Tacky,"Poorly written, full of errors,hypercritical of anyone who believes Darlie is guilty as sin. The pictures(very gruesome and gory) are the saving grace of this peice of work (if you want to call it that)apparently self published, unedited. I did not read CWB version of events, it was too much to swallow with his constant interjections, opinions and obvious goo goo eyes for Darlie. It is no longer in print so the cost was more than it is actually worth."
2,"Good book, however too much sarcasm used!","I have read all the Darlie books and have found this one to be compelling; however, the author uses too much sarcasm trying to prove his point, and comes across as immature."
1,DARLIE ROUTIER IS AS GUILTY AS SIN ITSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WHY WOULD SOMEONE WANT TO WASTE THEIR TIME ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS,GOD, DO SOMETHING WORTH WHILE AND PROFIT FROM THE TRUTH AND NOT COLD BLOODED MURDER. IT JUST REMINDS ME THAT, SOMEONE THINKS IF O.J. SIMPSON CAN GET OFF, WHY SHOULDN'T DARLIE GET OFF. THREE BIG REASONS !!!! 1. SHE WASN'T FAMOUS 2. SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY 3. AND SHE IS GUILTY AS SIN!!!!!!!!"
4,Sweet And Romantic,"This album begins like gangbusters with three pinnacle Nat King Cole's vocals. ""When I Fall In Love,"" ""Stardust,"" and ""Stay As Sweet As You Are,"" recall romance each time they reprise in a romantic film or TV show. But Nat's nuanced, witty singing begins drowning in Gordon Jenkins' symphonic sweep of stereophonic strings, until the ironic message of ""I Thought About Marie"" is lost and ""It's All In The Game"" seems strangely out of rhythm. Still, a Cole classic, albeit a conservative one."
3,personal rather than scholarly,"I was hoping for a more scholarly study of this interesting question, but this is really a collection of rambling essays that express the author's passing thoughts on various areas of religion and its abuses. She assumes that Zoroaster was originally a noble teacher of religious reforms and compares him to Jesus, but offers no evidence that either figure was a noble reformer. A proper exhaustive study of the Zoroastrian basis for the later monotheistic religions is desirable."
3,Interesting but...,The author showed a connection between this ancient religion and many of our present beliefs. Recomended for any study of religions both past and present. But I think she could have done it in a book half this size.
3,Good - a bit confusing - but I've had Ironman watches forever.,Good but confusing buttons if you have used Ironman watches as long as I have.
2,Disappointed in this product!!,"Hey cd holder fans, i was so excited to get this awesome looking carry case to put my portable cd player and headphones in! But, to my major disappointment, there simply isn't enough room to put hardly anything in it!! You easily store your portable player, but the headphones and any one cd would be impossible to fit in that tiny zippered space. Just realize that your supposed to hook your headphones on the outside of the case- which i don't like becuz i can easily loose them. There are way better and bigger cases out there that are reasonably priced, i'd look else where in my opinion."
4,Portable discman case,"Very nice, with various parts for headphones, batteries, CDs. Lightweight yet sturdy. I recommend it."
5,CASE LOGIC Nylon Portable CD Player Case,"I don't own this case but I found some stuff on Camera Annex about it. Here goes!.Rugged nylon and thick foam padding.Inner elastic strap to secure cd player.Zippered compartment for storing cd's or cd wallets.Removable, adjustable shoulder strapThats all I know! I hope i've been a help."
3,its ok,when i recieved it i loved the smell but one hour later i had a horrible headach also there is no Vanderbilt name on the bottle so im not really sure if this is how the original perfume smells like.but the price was good so if you dont have trouble with strong perfumes then im sure ul like it
3,V by Vanderbilt parfum spray,"I had ordered the 1.7 oz bottle and had payed for that too! I was, however, mailed a smaller size instead! After that, I wrote a review about how disheartened I was about this incident. Immediately after that, I was contacted in person and I did realize that it was an honest mistake on the vedor's part. The customer service agent was very nice and he did offer to send another item as replacement. I asked them not to though! I do not like accepting anything for free! I, however, appreciate this personal call and am appreciative of how courteous the agent was. I am revising the earlier review based on my personal pleasant experience and would like to thank the vendor for contacting me to set matters right."
5,Master plotter,"Swan is a master plotter, her characters are a close second, and then the pace and enjoyment take over. A must read for mystery readers!"
4,Glad I bought it!,"I had heard mixed reviews regarding ""No Nuclear War"", but since I really liked ""In My Song"" off of the ""Toughest"" compilation, I went for it all and picked this album up. I have to say that I am glad that I did. Although it may not be a reggae classic, it sure is enjoyable enough. All 8 songs are good, with ""Lessons In My Life"" and ""In My Song"" being as good as any Tosh song before them. ""No Nuclear War"" is a fitting opener and has Tosh pulling no punches with a smattering of bombs, horns, drums and guitar combining to lead the charge. ""Vampire"" is the obvious inspiration to Lucky Dube's, ""Dracula"", and possibly to Dube's entire trademark sound at that!"
1,Rectangle piece of fabric...,"This is not a slipcover. Basically it is a long rectangle piece of fabric. And, when they say ""partial back coverage"" they arn't joking. It barely fits over the back of the couch. Its not very practical because you have to fix it sooo much. For me this will just cover my ugly couch untill I can invest in a better ""stretch"" cover."
1,Its not a slip cover!,"Its a throw cover. big difference. and the thing always falls off the couch. don't waste your money buying theese. there are a rip off. if you do buy it, buy the sofa size for the love seat and make sure you have a short couch. theese were not made for the large stuffed couches of today."
3,The loveseat is covered.,"It's just a piece of material...doesn't fit to the loveseat/sofa itself. The same as putting a sheet or throw over it. However, functionally, it does what I need it to do, and that's keep the dogs from marking up the sofa with muddy paws. I suppose it might even double as a table cloth if in a pinch. The color is more golden then I expected..but it is relatively thick material...and, like I said...at least the sofas are being protected from dirty paws."
4,"Nice, but not perfect","I actually own the sofa and love seat versions. I love the design and the color is fantastic. They also wash up very nicely. I just wish that they would have had more structure. I know it's basically a sheet, but I'm ALWAYS having to readjust it on the couch."
3,"Nice, but not large enough for my Loveseat","My loveseat must be a little more pillowy then what this throw was meant for. It coves most of the loveseat, but the sides are left open for all to see. I was trying to cover up a hideous peach, pink, light blue flowery design, but you can still see it on the sides. The design of this throw is nice though. It is what I expected from viewing it online. I am thinking of buying a second one, and turning the 2 into a fitted couch cover.I didnt realize a throw would come untucked so often when people sat on it. But other then being too short on the sides, its not bad for the price. I would not have paid $50 for this though."
4,Matches the sofa throw..,Well made and a bargain. Great when kids come over.Also nice when you want to stretch out and a bit sweaty from working around the house.
1,Clumsy and smells bad!!,Its a huge piece of heavy material which you cant really tuck in too much. And it smells horrible! The odour still remains after 2 machine washes!
4,Whole living room looks great!,"I bought two of these for our two recliners. The reviews warn that it is just a piece of material and not foam backed. I had a black throw once and it rubbed off onto everything I wore while sitting on it. Not a problem with these. I have yet to wash them, but don't expect this to change.It makes the whole living room look good."
3,Sofa Throw Cover,The cover looks nice and the price can't be beat. The only negative side is I have to straighten the cover repeatedly as it slides off easily.
4,"Great product, at a great price!","I found this spray for men for half the price in store!! Great product,fast shipping . Thank you!!"
1,Park Tool Failure,I've owned three of these cleaners. They do a real nice job of cleaning the chain. The biggest problem I had with all three of the units is that they start to fall apart after only a few uses. Two of the units either the hinge point or latch point or both for the two metal clips break away leaving you unable to lock the top to the body. I only use the Park brand of chain cleaner. The third cleaner the actual cleaning brushes fell apart.I've ordered the Finish Line chain cleaner. I'll post a review of that product after I have used it for a period of time.
2,Broke on first use...,"I've used chain cleaners before, so I was very disappointed when it broke during its first use. It does thoroughly clean the chain, but the clips that hold the lid in place are 'WAY too tight. If you buy one, you may want to relax the wire clips before use. I will replace it with Nashbar's chain cleaner.[...]"
3,Not as sturdy as it should be,This does a good job cleaning your chain for the most part. If you use the brushes along with this you can do a good job. This is the second one that I have owned and my only complaint is that is does not hold up to normal wear and tear. My first one the plastic cracked after only a few uses so it wouldn't hold the cleaner. I am trying to be more cautious with this second one.
4,Probably the best chain scrubber I've used,"As usual, this Park product has delivered. The Cyclone is well built and has stood up to many chain cleanings. This is my second one but I pretty much abused the first one as much as someone could and it took it well. It's very solid, it does a good job of cleaning and it's easy to get replacement parts for it."
1,Very Poorly Made Product,"Are those 5 star reviews are real? I made a decision to buy this product based on the reviews. This is a piece of junk. This is so poorly made. Both side of hinge points for the two metal clips broke making me unable to lock after 1st use. This means i cannot use this any more. Yes I used this only once for less than 5 minutes. I do not recommend this product to anyone at all. By the way this is my first review at Amazon. I felt obligated to warn potential buyers how poor this product is. I buy stuffs from Amazon all the time, and this product is the worst I have ever purchased through Amazon."
2,bike chain cleaner,"It works so so, but you could obtain the same results just by spraying on a solvent and using a $2.00 parts cleaning brush. I also found that just spraying the chain with an autmotive brake cleaner works just as well. This item is a waste of money."
1,Fragile,"I have owned two. They work well, but if you drop them from ~3 feet(the height at which you will use it on a bike stand) they break. Each broke on the first drop. This would be a good product if they simply made it out of a less brittle plastic. It is a tool and tools get dropped."
1,Adds bristles to your chain,"I don't know, maybe having nylon bristles sticking out of your chain will help with traction on gnarly inclines... personally, I don't need it.Yes, this thing cleans chains nicely--it leaves them nice and bristling, rather than glistening.After enough uses, I wonder whether there will be enough bristles left on the cleaning wheels to do the job.Caveat emptor, big time."
3,Works but plastic breaks,"It works well. But I am on my third one. Whenever metal meets plastic its bad news. You use the metal clips to close the unit and where they meet the plastic tabs, it always breaks. Going to try the Finish Line one."
3,Different!,If I cut these into small-sized squares I can handle eating them... Almost like eating soft-gummy candy with strange flavors. I was glad I bought them just to experiment and try something new.
4,"first rate, 4.5 stars","Ackroyd has given us a hearty antidote for those drunk on nostalgia for the ""good ol' days."" Life hasn't really changed that much through the ages and there were no ""good ol' days."" Writers have always had to struggle with financial, personal and political matters. The works they hand down to us are as much indebted to windows of opportunity, fickle muses and cosmic whimsy as anything else . . . but perhaps that's not so bad. Or perhaps such forces are necessary for brilliance to emerge. Certainly, this bio makes one appreciate everything that is required for good lit to be born from the bog of daily life. I dare you to listen to this book and not go squirreling into your library to re-read the Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida."
1,Good First Attempt,"The production on here is very very good as the guitars sound big and meaty. I think that the singer goes a little over the top at times and should stay away from doing this on the next recording, meaning oversinging when he doesn't need to. Bass and drums are steady, stay in the pocket and don't really veer off course, which is how they should be. The songs - Alien Love Song is probably the best as it has a groove to it and the singer stays in a lower key which is his natural style. Velvatine is good instrumentally, but singer does a little over the top singing here which takes away from the subtlety of the songs........I am writing too much here...Overall - a good first effort."
2,a good start,"Not groundbreaking, but interesting irregardless. ""Pleasure Friend"" has a catchy chorus. Smashing Pumpkins-influenced, but lacking SP's emotional depth. The singer reminds me of the Cult's Ian Astbury on Thorazine."
2,utterly artless,"sure after a few glue hits it makes sense. but is it really neccessary ? No, it's not.sorry."
1,God Awful!,This is purely evil...............I think that the CIA should use this when torturing people as it would work wonders if given a chance.
1,An Atrocity,"Sounds like a big budget recording, but the songs are ridiculously weak. Although maybe I'm missing the point, maybe this is a parody of tired corporate rock."
1,do not liked,"smell really nice but besides that , do noting . even one dollar it is to mutch for this product ."
4,Practical Holiday Recipes,"I just found this cookbook and it's filled with many recipes I've known for years, as well as some new ones that look pretty easy to make. Just in time for the holiday season, too!"
5,Much better than anything I've tried,"These are definitely the best nipple covers that I have tried, and I have tried a lot! The silicone ones just make your breasts look strange, and the lighter more like bandaide ones just aren't substantial enough. Yes, after a really long day with certain bras, I do have to adjust them occassionally, and if I am in a situation where they HAVE to stay in place, I simply secure them with fashion tape."
3,These really do the job!,I bought these for my nineteen year old daughter at her request and she loves them! She says that she feels less self conscious in her fitted T-shirts and shirts. Great product!
1,Junk!,"I was so excited to get my new crock pot. It's such a pretty color, has a large capacity, and is able to be used as a serving dish. I have had this maybe two months and the pot has already cracked from the inside out, on the inside it has little spidery cracks going up the sides. This has never been dropped. The only thing I can think of is the heat from the dishwasher. The instructions say it is dishwasher safe. It is ready to split in two. Such a let down."
2,Skip it,Not very good quality my old one lasted years and years this one it no longer with us because it stopped heating
2,Cracked ceramic that I cannot replace,"This crock pot is so pretty to look at - I love the red color. And I think it does a fine job cooking my food although I often feel like it may be a bit big. I think I should get a 5 qt cooker next time. At any rate, my ceramic part has a hairline crack in it and now just a tiny amount of food is leaking through the bottom. So annoying. I looked for awhile on the internet for a replacement - to no avail. It just seems so wasteful to have to buy an entire new unit. . . but I guess that is what I will have to do."
1,Shocked,looked pretty but unusuable..the glase is all cracked in many places..I may use it later for a planter and I will never purchase anything from Amazon again..I have been in ER and too ill to repack and return..and not worth paying someone to do that..I can take a picture with my web-cam and send that...probley a product of China...I should have asked...
5,Great find.,My wife's Podiatrist sent her home with Amerigel for a minor surgery. We were amazed at the speed of healing that Amerigel provided. It now is first to use on scrapes and cuts. Great med.
5,Great product!,"My mom used this excellent cream on MRSA she had on her arm. Thankfully the MRSA is now gone. I purchased this product to use for a dog that I adopted who had an infected hot spot on his leg. It is now gone. Would recommend this to anyone for cuts, scrapes or more serious skin infections. Works great!"
5,"Awesomely good, unknown medicine","AmeriGel Wound Dressing 1 oz.I was introduced to AmeriGel by a podiatrist when my son had infected, ingrown nails. He applied AmeriGel, and his surgical cuts heals amazingly fast.I recently used AmeriGel on a deep laceration on my shin, which required stitches. For the first 11 days, I used Neosporin on the wound, together with daily cleaning and bandaging, and it remained raw. Somewhat out of desperation (and remembering my son's experience), I switched to AmeriGel. The wound started closing the same day, and 3 days later, it has started to heal.I continue to be amazed how effective AmeriGel is."
5,Foot Blisters etal,"Used three tubes over last five years and excellent product even for slow( eg: Diabetic ) healers, only a thin layer is best, always keep wound protected and with a clean gauze dressing, well worth the expense if you are taking wound healing seriously"
5,Great Product,This is a little spendy---but--well worth your investment. I'm not sure what the ingredient is that helps heal---but it's AMAZING....
5,Amazing wound dressing,"A very good wound dressing for diabetics, the dressing promotes rapid healing which is a great benefit for people with diabetes.."
5,Works,"If you have any problem with a wound that will not heal, try this. Works wonders!This is something that I want to keep on hand all the time."
4,AMERIGERL,THE PRODUCT DID NOT CLOSE MY HUSBAND WOUND. IT DID HELP WITH THE ORDER AND SEEPAGE.. I DO NOT KNOW IF I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR FUTURE USE.
3,Too many retreds,"All of the songs are good, especially Eye of the Tiger, but to use the same version of Gonna Fly Now from the first film here, when you had such a nice, up-tempo/disco/rock version of it in the movie - I don't understand. (BTW, the training sequence in Rocky III is my favorite out of the series - seeing Paulie pulled in the pool near the end was awesome!)They did the same thing with the Rocky II soundtrack. The version used in the movie is different from the one on the soundtrack"
1,It's [bad]!,"This soundtrack is a waste of money. It's the same as Rocky and Rocky IV. If you do have Rocky IV don't get III. Rocky III has almost the same songs from I and IV. It's a waste of good money. Stick with I, II, IV. Rocky V is allright but the only good song on there is Measure of a Man by Elton John. Anyways stick with I, II, IV. Don't get III and V it's dumb!"
5,A great book for Delphi programmers,"This book gave me loads of real useful examples for the broad range of Delphi 4 capabilities. The writing is entertaining, easy to read and understand."
5,Delphi 4 Unleashed Delivers what it promises!,"One thing you can count on with Charlie Calverts books is an easy read. He has a nack for presenting technical material in a readable format. I really hate the CD-ROM chapters that are becoming increasingly popular with publishers today but I would rather see that then too much beginners material wasting space between the covers. I also like the way he does not waste page space with full code examples. It is all on the CD-ROM, however, where it should be. This book is not a starting point for learning to program with Delphi 4. It is also not the most advanced material on the subject. It perfectly targets that gap in between those two categories and directs you to more advanced publications where appropiate. There is still enough advanced material to make this book a must have for the intermediate to advanced Delphi 4 Programmer."
1,sorry I purchased this item,"I emailed a complaint to Amazon on the subject of this fan and did not receive a reply.I e mailed the seller twice and had no reply, the fixture was poorly made all the screw holes for the globe were painted over preventing a proper fit for the globe. The globe was thinner in density of glass than other globes and broke . Ihave asked for assistance with this problem and have received no answer I would not recommend this seller."
2,Not What I Expected,"At first I thought this book dealt with the WWII overseas combat photos of John Bushemi, and even though many of them were shot overseas they do not show the horrors of war, the stark chaos of combat infantrymen fighting in an arena of death and destruction, the solemnity of the aftermath of battle. As a combat photographer, John Bushemi had many combat photos, but they definitely are not in this book. I would not buy this book again, and I would not encourage anyone else to buy it."
5,the usual suspects...NOT!,"This must have been an interesting conference: a multinational cast of the usual suspects (Scott Snyder, Kyongman Jeon, Aidan Foster-Carter et al.) joined by some functional area specialists (Jeffrey Pilkington, Danny Leipziger et al.) for added spice.Among the highpoints: Heather Smith's dissection of the food situation, David Steinberg's thoughtful reflections on South Korean politics, and Holger Wolf's demolition of the myths of German unification. Anthony Michell provides a heterox view of the North Korean economy. It may not be a convincing view, but it is a welcome antidote to usual recitation of Bank of Korea figures."
2,dissapointing,This is a very loud and expensive machine that I returned because it gave off a funny smell when used and left my fruit shakes lumpy. Amazon quickly gave me a refund and I then bought an Osterizer Classic (retro red beehive style) which works great and is less than half the price of the Krups.
2,Overpriced and disappointing,"An expensive, quality ""looking"" item makes you think ""well this must be worth the price."" But I had a similar incident as that of a previous reviewer.First of all: the first one I bought was broken...in pieces (upon opening it).You think, well that could be shipping.So, I get it replaced. And then, I try to make a sauce inside it and the thing starts leaking from the bottom. then the bottom separates, and wow... this thing SUCKS.When it comes to online reviewing, it is rare for me to use my time to write a negative review, as I'd rather focus on items i'm happy with. But I've never been so disappointed in a product that, on the surface, looked so strong. And the thing is pricey.Oh yea, to add insult to injury, my wife and I never got around to returning it, so it just sits there as a testament to our laziness and purchasing misfortune. I've literally used it twice in 3 months."
1,Don't Buy!,"I read all the reviews and continued to buy this blender because I wanted something quiet. As stated in the other reviews, it doesn't blend smoothies very well and after just one month of owning, the motor died. Not worth your money!"
1,Throwing this junk away,"I am so thoroughly disgusted with this piece of junk. The bottom will not stay on. The reviewer who said you just didn't lock it into place must have bionic arms. I stood there grunting and twisting and crying while trying to get this assembled. Yes, I slid the locking ring on and made sure it fits into the grooves. It will do a slight twist and no matter how much bulging biceps and grunting I do, it will not finish twisting and locking. I have never been able to use it, so that is the biggest waste of $150 I've ever spent. I bought it about 6 months ago and just finally pulled it out to use it for the first time, so I can't even return it."
1,Not worth the money,"This blender won't even blend a banana, there are always little chunks left in the bottom. The motor has an electrical burning smell and the bottom can open very easily, draining all the liquid onto the motor base and that burns out the motor!!It's not a very good piece of kitchen equipment. Krups should be ashamed of itself!"
3,BEST BLENDER... but it has 1 serious flaw,"This is definitely the best blender I've ever owned when it comes to making thick frozen (but not icy) smoothies. Unfortunately, it has a serious flaw in that the jar can rotate off the base when blending. Krups obviously knows this as I see they no longer sell this model. Hopefully, they will fix it and come out with an even better blender for about the same price - the others that can blend this well START around $300! The other flaw is that it doesn't pour the thick frozen smoothie very well. As stated in other posts.... you do need to start on the ice crush mode before going up to the highest blend speed to get a truly smooth ice (frappuccino or frozen fruit) smoothie."
5,Krups Blender,This is the best blender I have ever purchased. The chop ice option is great. It is easy to use and easy to clean up after use.
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"I purchased my blender two years ago, and use it on average twice a month to make smoothies. I use fresh and canned fruits with a little ice, and so I consider myself a moderate user. I bought into the durability of the 1000w motor power since the motors from the last blenders burned out with the same usage. Well, my blender stopped working yesterday. To say the least I was disappointed since I expect the machine to last more than 48 uses. The next day I call Krups customer service to explain the situation, and despite the circumstance they state the unit is out of warranty and I would have to pay out of pocket for its repair. I think given that this blender cost $150 at the time of purchase I deserve a little satisfaction. Definitely not worth the money, and customer satisfaction even worse."
1,Just a pretty face,"This is a nice looking blender but it is a wimpy appliance. It consistently leaves chunks of ice and lumps of fruit in my morning smoothie. Quiet? Yes, but only because it doesn't have enough power to do the job. And then there's the burning rubber smell that it gives off. Very annoying! This was a replacement for a Waring RB75 that lasted 5 weeks before the blade assembly broke. We will be replacing this one today with a Cuisinart."
4,A Kitchen Workhorse,"I bought my blender in May 2007. I used it at least once per day making smoothies, which consisted of mostly frozen fruit and nuts. When it finally gave out four years later, I sent it in for repair. Krups told me it wasn't repairable and sent me a new one!It's a quiet blender compared to most and blends almost everything well and consistently. It's not as good as a Vitamix, but it is a third of the price.I won't need another blender for at least four years, but if I did, I would consider another Krups!"
2,not worth getting,"I bought this for close to $300 about 3 years ago. It was certainly better than my $40 cheap one.but if did leave chunks in my frozen fruit smoothies. and sometimes I had to stick a spoon in (while turned off of course) to get things moving again.I used it about 3 times a week for three years, but suddenly it will not even turn on.I don't think it over heated it just died.it certainly was fine but not anything special."
2,umm not sure if I'm loving it.,"I received it for my bridal shower. Broke it out for the july 4th weekend to make frozen watermelon margheritas. yum (frozen watermelon cubes, contreau, lime juice, tequila- much more healthy than the shakes described in the other reviews;. It did smell, but so did my new toaster, its just a new appliance smell. It DID blend the margheritas, but it left chunks of watermelon in the center. Not the worst experience, but this thing is like a tank compared to my hamilton beach blender that did the job (loud) but got it done. i wouldnt run out to buy it, but its not the worst."
5,Great blender,"I have used this blender twice now to make green smoothies. I bought it as a less expensive alternative to the Vita Mix after reading reviews on here that it was capable of liquefying ingredients. I've made two green smoothies with apples, pineapple, spinach and bananas with no problem at all. My old Oster would barely touch the spinach. I've yet to try cruciferous veggies, but the power of this blender should handle it well. It's very quiet, too, which is a nice benefit especially for such a powerful machine."
1,It's a fragile beast,"Chose it for its quietness, but that did not include my cries of despair when the delicate bottom mechanism jammed after a day. Too complicated in the jar base, too fragile in its plastic parts, more watts than you need.Got Cuisinart at 500 watts, am very happy."
1,Keeps breaking!,"I bought this blender over 1 year ago. It is on it's third trip back to Krups for repair. I have a smoothie for breakfast every morning during the week. Nothing too crazy. This monster of a blender can't even handle a daily smoothie. Don't waste your money! This may be a German brand, but the sticker says ""Made in Mexico"". Absolutely worthless."
3,Not A First Choice,"Telemann's epic Tafelmusik is an amazing achievement by anyone's standard. Unfortunately the present recording doesn't really do it for me. The playing is not distinguished and there is some less than desirable intonation, especially from the woodwind. Better to try the Harnoncourt, Hunteler (with The Camerata of the 18th Century), or (if you like to eat fast) Goebel. There are still not that many complete recordings available to choose from, which begs the rather obvious question - when will Jeanne Lamon and her wonderful group ,Tafelmusik, do it?"
3,Quality not up to expectations,"Overall this is a very well designed mug both in look and feel. However, after just a few hand washings the platinum band began to wear off. Obviously this is a concern not only for aesthetics, but also for safety when I wonder if the ""platinum"" is being ingested when I drink from it."
3,Not Durable,"There are good things and bad things about this toy. The bad things are : 1.The wheels dropped from one of the space planes the very first time I played with it. I WAS VERY UPSET! I had to glue the wheels back on. 2.There was no Venturestar space plane in the set like the product description said. I thought the space planes would be metal, but they weren't. Also they are TOO small.The good things: There is some infomation about the space planes on the back of the package. I would not recommend this toy!"
4,headphones??,"i just thought i should bring up a good point...where do the headphones fit? it shows the cd cases and the player, but what about the headphones?"
3,Nice but not what I expected,"I didn'[t realize this was primarily a book of good photographs. Getting ready for a trip and knowing little, I was expecting that the book was something of a personal memoir of the author's trip to her ancestral homeland. There is some commentary, but It is not personal; I was disappointed. Clearer description of the approach would have avoided this disappointment.Something of a more personal memoir or impressions would be welcome."
1,lousy shippers,Apparently $3.96 isn't enough to ship these envelopes. It's looking like this company is going to take 4 to 6 weeks for me to receive this item.
3,Been there done that,"This is a tight band and they know how to play straight ahead basic blues. But there's nothing terribly new or inspiring here. Sure, they'd be great to see live but they aren't blazing new territory with this effort. Don't buy it new. Download it or get it used. It's just okay."
5,Eye opening and Scary,"Because of the other ""Hillary"" books I've read, I tend to believe Anderson's anecdotal biography. His style is fast-moving and entertaining which makes for an easy read. This book will leave you with the same sense of helpless fascination that overcomes those poor folks in horror movies that stand dumbfounded before the monster in the instant before it destroys them."
5,Why is the left so afraid of the truth,"Mr. Anderson deals with the issues in a fair way. He asks the right questions and presents an excellent case for a woman with seemingly good intentions, but consumed with power."
2,DON'T DO IT...,"If I were you, I'd take a look at the history of publications that Christopher Andersen has written, then think TWICE about purchasing this book. Go ahead...just in case you're attempting to determine if this book is worth your valuable time...take a gander at the author's writings. They have an overt history of scandalism based on small morsels of skewed data. I only gave this book a rating of 2 stars because Chris is SMART enough to cash in on the jaded desire that the public seems to have to believe only the absolute WORST about a person. Admit it -- we're drawn to it -- it's this that catches the public's attention. However, I promise that once you investigate the history of the author's writings, if you have even the most remote of critical thinking skills, you'll spend your cash on a much better form of reading fare. Not worth it. Trust me."
1,BOOOOOOYYY.....!!!!!!,"...I didn't know Hillary was THAT dangerous. You mean she's actually on the verge of conquering the whole world? Where will we be safe? The moon? Mars?? (Imbecile! She will control NASA, too!)But for now I'm more concerned for Christopher Anderson who has now exposed her EVIL plans (""The Plan"", no less!). Where will he be hiding from her?And where will all those brave right wing scribblers hide, who give us the same insufferable garbage in ever new versions since bloody 1992...!!?? I read parts of it in the store. That was enough for me, call me shallow - but who's buying this stuff anyway?"
1,I found obvious lies in first few pages,"I started reading this book, and found lies right at the start. The author claims it was Hillary's idea to trash the White House offices as the Clinton administration left and the Bush's moved in, including the famous ""removal of the letter 'w'"" from the computer keyboards. The problem with this tale is a GAO investigation found it wasn't true, just another right wing attempt to tarnish the Clintons.There is certainly plenty to say about Bill and Hillary, but I'd rather read something factual rather than rummage through a National Enquirer style trash dump. Hillary haters will love it though."
1,Why is the right so afraid of Hillary?,"I bought this book at the local B&N and finished it last night.Sheesh. Waste of my limited leisure time, I must say.The main question this book left unanswered for me? See the ""title"" of this review.Please don't waste YOUR time on this one."
1,A Total Waste of Money,"This sleaze-fest would be hilarious, if it wasn't so sad. I think the only thing sadder is some of these reviews, wherein right-wing conservatives are worried that Hillary is going to usher in an era of Communism, Socialism, and every other scourge known to mankind. Oh, please! This book is just a hatchet-job, pure and simple. Nothing could be more obvious. Don't buy it with any illusions of quality. I'm sorry I bought it at all."
2,"Not a Clinton Fan, but this...","This book is flimsily sourced. Lets get this fact out of the way. There can be nothing authoritative about a book that doesn't cite many of its sources. Therefore, it is hard to separate fact from fiction, as it simply raises many suspicions.It is an enjoyable read, but you end up feeling guilty about its gossipy, bathroom-stall, style critiques. I wouldn't be adverse to reveling in gossip about the Clintons, as I hold them in no certain esteem, but I need sources. At least a few.Pros: Fun.Cons: Everything else.I can not recommend this is good faith."
1,Poorly written and edited,"This book was as poorly written and edited as a National Enquirer article. When it mentioned a ""Gallop poll"" instead of ""Gallup"" as it is supposed to be spelled, I put it down. If neither the author nor the editors had the knowledge or the eye for mistakes to get something that simple correct, how do we know they got anything else correct?"
4,Hillary Clinton - Unmasked,"Well researched, well written. I feel I need to urge all those who might vote her into the White House - OUR House - to reconsider putting this woman there. Mr. Anderson has done a superb job of showing the reader how frightening Hillary Clinton is in her climb to power, and more power."
2,too biased!,The author did no research but repackaged other works and added inflammatory and biased comments.The book had some interesting stories but mainly too much space was spent slamming Senator Clinton.Not recommended.
3,Book for Hilary Haters,"I read this book with my mouth agape much of the time. Hilary has been accused of everything except the murder of Laci Peterson...but that may come yet. In one passage the author even quoted an unnamed contributor to the Clinton campaign as being ""not sad"" that a certain journalist perished on 9-11. Now Hilary would be responsible for every idiot comment that anyone who ever contributes to her campaign makes? PLEASE! There are so many similar events in this book that those that really hate the Clintons can snuggle up with this book and have a field day.If you like even minded reporting and have any sense of fair play, pass this one by. If you enjoy reading what the Rightous Right are doing- this would be a good read.Hilary Clinton is one of the smartest women in America, and we need her to help out this country on the right track. This book will be used to elevate the head of my bed to prevent acid reflux."
1,A retread of Bill and Hillary: The Marriage,"This book is full of juicy stories first seen in Andersen's earlier book, Bill and Hillary: The Marriage. There is very little new here and this appears to be an attempt by the author to make some extra cash this election year. Save your money and buy the earlier book used for a penny."
2,"Interesting Read, Questionable Journalism","American Evita is undoubtedly a page-turner, but those of you looking for a fair portrayal of Hillary Clinton will not find it here.Unfortunately, the author has a clear slant: to portray the former First Lady in the most negative light possible. The author essentially accuses Bill Clinton of being a rapist and Hillary of being an anti-Semite, including a story (with questionable sourcing) of her not entering someone's home because they were Jewish.If you are hater of Hillary, you will love this book. If you love Hillary, you will be even more convinced of a right-wing conspiracy. But if you are just looking for a well-researched biography, you'll be flat-out disappointed."
1,Different from the music sampler,"The CD delivered is different from what is been shown in the music sampler which is totally unacceptable.Eg. Track 17 of CD2: Verdi: Act III. La donna è mobile, is completely different in the CD delivered compared to what is been added to the sampler in Amazon. This is the track for which I bought this whole CD for and now its not there in the CD delivered.I'm far from USA now and there is no way to return it either."
5,A-Z Classical,I recieved the product quuckly and it was better than I had hoped! This is very good for the peson who wants to start learning about the great composers! Thx for a nice product
4,Nice beginner's book,This book provides a good basic beginning to blacksmithing. There is enough information to get started and try enough to determine whether to pursue it further.
5,"Una autèntica ""Biblia "" para conservar","al hombre de tu vida...INFALIBLE !Un gran libro que pone al desnudo el alma masculina ...y la deposita en nuestras manos !Mi matrimonio es màs feliz que antes ( y era muy feliz ), desde que me regalaron este libro !¿Y vieras què sencillos son los hombres ?¿Què fàciles de complacer ?( Y QUÈ AGRADECIDOS ! )"
5,Well done!,A GREAT illustrated discussion of the San Andreas fault [and allies] by a master storyteller and photographer. [Declaration: Michael is a former student]
5,Not find this cd.,"Not find this cd and even songs to download. Really wanted to buy the cd because I appreciate the inserts! I do not regret, because the songs are unique."
4,Accomplished and Original,"Jerome Van Rossum's mostly instrumental ""Diplomatic Immunity"" gets better each time I hear it. He effectively combines 70's funk with more contemporary grooves, without resorting to overuse of sampled bits like most generic ""acid jazz"" artisits out there. Check out the Indian-influenced ""Chittagong Groove"", ""the Phunky Bishop"" and the title track for album highlights. Also check out Van Rossum's new Latin Jazz album ""Mata Buena"", which may actually slightly surpass Diplomatic Immunity in my opinion. Both CDs have been welcome additions to my collection."
3,Works ok,"I bought this unit for frequent Power Points. I was excited about the item because of the built in mouse, however, the mouse moves rather slowly across the computer screen. I can walk to my computer and use the mouse 10 times faster. The other problem I had was determining which mode I was in. The button furthest to the bottom of the unit toggles the unit between slide show and mouse. There is no way of knowing which function you are in until you fumble around with it for a while. Once your in slide show mode the unit works fine. Do not buy the unit for the mouse if that is what you are planning. I recomment this unit based on price and function with slide shows only. You can spend more money and possibly have the best of both worlds (slide shows/mouse)."
2,The most Beautiful Place in the world,"This book, I bought, even though I am 24 years old. It was too short, but that could have just been because of my age. I did like the latter part of it. Probably the last third or the last 4th of the book was when I thought it was good and wanted it to continue."
1,Don't EVER read this book to a single parent child,"Eventhough the book speaks of hard work and drive, I am sad my second grader read it. It speaks of a child who had a father who left he and his mother and a mother who meets a new man and leaves the child behind. The mother tells the 7 year old boy that the man didn't want him (basically, fend for yourself son, I'm looking after me). Later his mother and new man come and take the boy's bed for themselves and leaves him to sleep on a rug. The plot very clearly depicts how insensitive and selfish people who are supposed to be protecting children can be.Do any of us really want our children to worry that if their single parent meets a spouse that they would be discarded like this? This is not something an unsuspecting second grader should read. Buyer beware!"
3,Problems keeping a charge,"My husband and I have used Braun, now Oral B, electric toothbrushes for going on 10 years. Our dentist insisted that for better home cleaning we do so. We were completey satisfied with the Braun appliances but it seems that since they've been Oral B that they don't hold a charge for long at all. I think we average 3 days for a single charge on one appliance and we do not share our appliances, so that's one chage lasting 3 days with the appliance being used once a day for about 2 to 2.5 minutes each time (we were advised to use itonly once a day to preserve tooth enamel). I hope Oral B will improve the battery chargers. We are now about to each buy another electric toothbrush which will make 2 new ones for each of us in a 12 month period. I hope this will be helpful to others in selecting their applianaces."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I do not know what this recording is, but it does not seem to be the Clancy Brothers, despite their prominent billing. There only seems to be one person performing, presumably Hammond, but I hear no evidence of Tom, Paddy, Liam, or Bobby Clancy. I've heard enough of their recordings to know their voices. Buy at your own risk!"
4,Good way to pass the time,This toy is fun to build but you can't really play with it. These are cheaper and better than legos. If you get a lot of these I suggest to make a shelve to hold them all. If you want to get something that will keep you busy for a short amount of time get this. I finished it in less than 24 hours. If you want somthing that will be finished quicker than this get a snap together model. this will keep you entertained. If you like this I think you should get a lot of them. The Mega Bloks Space Shuttle took me about two weeks two do. The space shuttle is a little more challenging than the Ford GT. If your a begginer at Mega Bloks Probuilders I highly recommend this item.
2,"A good ""read"" but...","Mr. Adelman persists in referring to Baltimore as the capital of Maryland, not once but many times throughout the book. This is annoyingly inaccurate (Have you ever heard of Annapolis, Mr. Adelman?), but makes one wonder what other factual inaccuracies lurk in the book. Did this book actually have an editor? Do you get the feeling that editors these days merely hit grammar check and spell check and call it a day?"
1,A Major Disappointment,I remember the season very well and was looking forward to reading it. It contained so many glaring factual errors and undocumented assertions that I did not even get halfway through the book. I gave it one star out of pity. The author should have hired a fact checker.
5,"Here's to you, Mr. Robinson","Attention baseball fans who are looking for the best reads in 2006...The two outstanding baseball books this season are ""National Pastime"" and ""Black and Blue."" Why?? Frank Robinson is why. Robby is the ""Man for All Seasons"", as told in these incredible two extraordinary straight-forward non-fiction books re-capping the 1966 Baltimore Orioles and the 2005 Washington Nationals seasons. These efforts are sports writing at its finest by two of the trade's brightest and most promising upcoming reporters. I urge baseball fans to seek out and relish Frank Robinson --this 70 year-old legend and icon who epitomizes what is great about the National Pastime. ""God bless you please, Mr. Robinson, heaven holds a place for those who pray. A nation turns its lonely eyes to you."" Good luck, Skip, in 2006!!!!"
2,Poorly Researched Book,"This book takes a wonderful story about major league baseball and a city and turns it into a minor league work. Adelman apparently never visited Baltimore, consulted a map or talked to anyone who was directly involved in the events he attempts to describe. He relies on second-hand sources and commits enough factual errors (Frank Robinson's Mother's Day home run off Luis Tiant, Baltimore as the capital of Maryland?, etc.)to be put into the DH role. If you are from Baltimore or have fond memories of the 1966 World Series, you'll want to read this book - but you'll be frustrated and angry once you do because the book is a slap at the intelligence of baseball fans everywhere."
5,Racing Fans will love it!,"This is the second time I have gotten this game. I gave it as a present to my brother, who had grown up in Indiana and is a true racing fan. I love the fact of all the little gimmicks and having funny characters to choose from. Whenever my niece and nephew come over, it is one of their favorite things to do."
1,Ulead Media Studio Pro 7.0,"I bought it 6 months ago and have yet to produce 1 respectable project. The technical support is non-existant and vague. In factI'm attempting another project today and I need updates and patches....ALL the websites are unavailable.the program itself is WAY too complex and you have to carry out far too many mouse clicks to simply apply and adjust transitions. Transitions are not smooth (Audio & Video).Ulead says it runs on 98SE,which I originally had, but when I ran into problems, their solution was switch to 2000. I did, it's still finnikey. $450 is now collecting dust. It looks like ADOBE Premiere now!"
1,the WORST editor in history,"Now, it's rare I hate a single program because I believethat there is a lot of potential and use in a many appsaround these days, unfortunately this is not the case forthis heinous product. Hate is definitely the apt word Ihold for Media studio pro. It is by far the most frustrating,confusing, useless video editor on the market today.How do these people sleep at night by charging so much forabsolute garbage.People - heed my warning..by VEGAS 5.0 instead. I give thatproduct a heavy endorsement and thoroughly recommend it toamatuers and professionals alike. It is simply brilliantand a dream to use - THE WAY VIDEO EDITORS SHOULD BE."
5,"i,s one of he greats books i read in my life",this book is so good for the medical student in order to understand the eye and its anatomical strucher and later on it makes the student able to understand the diseases that affect the eyes
5,Great option for spair ammo !!!,The Tacstar sidesaddle is the best of the best for holding you spair ammo. I have tried a feww other types of ammo holders and this one is the stuff !!!!
5,nice thing to have bolted to the side of your 12 gauge,"Very Nice piece of hardware to add to your 12 gauge...this combinded with a tube extension, and a shot shell sling, we are talking nearly 2 BOXES of ammo on hand ready to go at a moments notice..."
2,These are not 4x6 prints.,Do not buy these! I am so mad that Amazon told me these were the proper replacement stock for my printer. My printer wants(and I want) bigger prints. Beware! I am stuck with all this small paper now! :-(
2,"Interesting (historical), but not very practical","Of some historical interest, but not current with everyday usage. Although the book does define some of the most obvious differences (e.g. Petrol vs. Gas), many words or terms used by the British are taken for granted and left out. For example, ""pensioner"" was provided with a very quirky and specific definition of a particular type of Cambridge student, when its most common use corresponds to a retired person. Also, the author has taken a very conservative line, so most of the expletives are left out. Not very helpful - unless you spend every Sunday in church! Also, business terms are not defined.Other examples of words or phrases not defined (or with incorrect or obsolete defintions) include:CurryTerms of ReferenceLadBarristerNHS (National Health Service)Plus many more..."
4,Needed for class and just in time,My teacher has taken out so many parts of this book for further reading I had to get it. Very comprehensive.
1,I'll Pass Next Time When Experiencing Buddhism,"This class was terrible so my review is going to be a bit biased. I did not enjoy the book or the class. I thought the book a bit confusing, just like the class is."
1,Irritated customer,"While the quality of the paper itself was good- I used Avery's online program to print my cards. The images on the cards were constantly off, and the page which allowed me to adjust the setting of how it printed did not work- Out of the 200 cards that I received- I will only be able to use about 50 of them. Every time that I tried to adjust settings it would not work. I'm sure it's easier for those that have Microsoft Word- but I wouldn't recommend the online template."
3,a big dissapointment,"finally able to get around to reading ginsberg, i was quickly let down. i am a huge fan of the beats. kerouac is one of my favorite writers, burroughs isn't far behind, i believe a lot of what they believe, i love to read about their lives, corso and snyder are poets i like, so i expected to be blown away by ginsberg. he is one of the three leaders of the movement. but his poetry continually let me down. don't get me wrong, he has some wonderful works (howl, kaddish, and a few others), but as a whole, his work is highly dissapointing. i almost wonder if he received his reputation because of friendship with kerouac and cassady or if it all rests on howl. i think he was more a personality than a poet. but i do think this book should be read by anyone serious about poetry, literature, or the beats. he is still an essential poet."
4,fantastic way to get a grip on 50 years of grand prix racing,"What an enjoyable read! At time the chapters are to short, but the drama is gripping and pulls you completly into the fray! this book is like having an encyclopedia of GP racing on your bookshelf! A must have for any F1 fa"
5,good value,"I use this size envelope to store my bills,record, etc. I did not expect the quality to be good because of the price. The price was five dollars cheaper than anywhere else AND FREE SHIPPING. I was pleasantly surprise at the quality of these envelopes. They are as good as other envelopes that I have bought at Staples, etc.In the future I will buy my envelopes from Amazon.com."
3,Black Hanes Hood,Was disappointed in the size. Always wash all my black in cold water so thatthe item doesn't shrink. Believe it's a small Lg. Liked the heavy dutyzipper.
5,Hooded Sweatshirt from South Horizon - EXCELLENT,"My experience in purchasing the hooded sweatshirt from South Horizon was EXCELLENT. The merchandise was as advertised,in new condition, and delivery was fast. Also, South Horizon's customer service representative was very helpful and friendly. All in all, I would rate South Horizon as an A+++++ seller. And it's so convenient going through Amazon for a seamless transaction."
3,Informative but wished they had more pictures,I like the book however it would have been better had they had more pictures of the trees and plants.
1,Fails in All Regards,"This book was very disappointing. It was not well written, and the content was also not helpful. The author, who admits to a lack of education, glosses over some very profound subject material without adding anything meaningful to the topics covered. Her ""guided meditations"" and ""exercises"" seem to be her own ""touchy/feely"" imaginings, and are not thoughtful, relevant or helpful."
3,"An interesting read,but......","I read the reviews,looked inside the book before deciding to buying it.All that helped.This book is okay.Its interesting but I didnt enjoy it.You might."
4,Great Strategy Book - Desk reference for anyone in E-Commerc,This book covers the major system and processes in major logistical systems. Anyone in dealing with designing a heterogenous system should get this book. It will probably become your bible. In fact I bought this book before. I lost it in a move and I'm going to buy it again right now.
5,Profitable e-commerce regardless of the product or service,"Logistics And Fulfillment For e-Business: A Practical Guide To Mastering Back Office Functions For Online Commerce is a straightforward instructional manual to the basic logistics of designing, managing, and running an efficient model for profitable e-commerce regardless of the product or service being offered. From outsourcing technology; to dealing profitably with shipping costs (including the pros and cons of USPS versus other package shippers); to handling customer relations in e-Business; and much, much more, Logistics And Fulfillment For e-Business is a handy, user friendly, ""how-to"" reference with invaluable, practical advice for any merchant or entrepreneur setting up an e-storefront to supplement (or replace) a traditional brick-and-mortar based commercial operation."
2,Out-dated,"Reading this book, one gets the impression that the author has a need to dazzle the readers with her business vocabulary and acumen. I wasn't dazzled or impressed. I found it distracting. If you are looking for an ancient e-commerce guide, this is your book. Check the copyright date. You will find some solid and timeless principles but I wouldn't waste my time. If you are serious about learning logistics and fulfillment for your e-business, find something that is current and up-to-date with the industry."
5,An Absolute Must,"I think this book should be required reading for anyone about to get a puppy or anyone involved in the business of training dogs. This book has such a kind, thoughtful and effective method of relating to and training your puppy.Wonderful!"
5,Can a book have a profound effect on your life ? Yup...,"My wife and I never dreamed we could love a dog so much. This book was an extremely important part of getting to that point. We now firmly believe there are no such things as ""bad dogs"", just owners that think they know all they need to as owners (and thus blame the dog when something doesn't work).But I also need to mention how useful the ""Puppy Aptitude Test"" was for us. We used it while looking for a puppy, and it was how Baker responded to our informal ""quizzes"" that brought us to the dog meant for us.Buy the book AND follow through with its advice. ESPECIALLY, give your dog the time it deserves and needs, and you'll all reap enormous awards."
4,Good e-book,I just adopted a new lab puppy and selected this book to assist in the process. Excellent concepts and the narrator of this book does a very good job. We recommend it.
3,not the best training guide.,"I have read tons of other training guides, and while I found this book a good read, it was not exactly helpful in terms of training. It focused more on their monastery, stories about dogs they trained, and the birthing process of a German Shepherd. Mind you, I'm big GSD lover so I enjoyed this book, but I wish I had purchased another book for more tips on training.Some of the tips offered are great and work well, but there should have been more. But do keep in mind the book's title! ""The ART of Raising a Puppy,"" not ""HOW to Raise a Puppy."" So it's understandable that there are numerous stories and other bits of info. But if you're looking for a real how-to guide with a lot of tips, I would look elsewhere."
5,A must have for puppy owners!!,"This book was great!! They have great training techniques that are great for us and for our pup!! There is tons of advice and info, that we have used on our puppy, and he is doing very well. Whether you are getting a dog/puppy, or just like reading about dogs- this book is a must to read!"
4,A Must Read for New Puppy Owners or Soon-to-be,"A very engaging, thorough and practical guide book! One that I wish I had read prior to getting my Yorkie pup. The book is laid out in a logical manner, and although the major references stem from the New Skete Monks vast experience with German Shepherds, the knowledge that they share is easily applicable to all breeds. Not living in a monastery does have its drawbacks as I do not have all of the time to carefully follow their training program. Nevertheless, their insights (both spiritual and practical) have been of enormous benefit to me in raising my puppy. I am very indebted to this wise and caring community."
5,For new owners,"Neither my husband nor I had ever owned a dog before, much less a puppy. We relied on the two books by the Monks of New Skete for our own training as new owners. I cannot recommend them highly enough. These books are for all dogs, not just Shepherds."
2,"Old and outdated, let's move onto new and improved","I remember reading this book years ago and thinking it was an awesome book. The section on the different growth periods of puppies is very good, however, much of the other information is outdated and incorrect. Many aspects such as the alpha roll and their concept of dominance theory has been proven not to work and there are better ways to get your point across to the puppy or dog. Many excellent dog behaviorists such as Ian Dunbar, Jean Donaldson, Patricia McConnel have more recent methods you can use with raising your dog and are highly respected among dog trainers across the country and internationally."
2,This out-dated training info does more harm than good.,"The field of dog training has advanced greatly in the past 10 years and this book simply does not utilize all of the wonderful dog friendly methods avaialble to dog owners in this enlightened age. If trainers/educators of whales, bears and even children no longer rely on physical force to teach and motivate, why should dog trainers? Training should be informative and fun!"
1,There are better ways...,"I prefer books that emphasize a postiive training approach, see Jean Donaldson, Ian Dunbar, etc. Using physical force, even mild, can be counterproductive. Before buying this book I would reccomend getting it and several others from the library and comparing them. Then follow your heart...."
2,"Helpful, but not 5 stars.","This book has some helpful information, however it focuses on a celebration of their technique rather than the technique itself. Maybe the first book should be purchased as a companion (though its copyright is 1978 and may be dated).There is too much about their success stories. It just didn't feel right to me. Worth a look, but not to be relied upon as a sole source for training information."
5,raising a puppy,"I have worked professionally with dogs for the last 7 years and am grateful that I found straight forward talk from the Monks. They have incredible insight into canine behavior. For people who cannot handle the 'shakedown', keep in mind that this is rarely needed, for if you have a strong enough relationship with dogs, they will respond long before the 'shakedown' is necessary. Out of approximately 8,000 dogs to cross my path (in a day care environment), this maneuver was needed with only 1 dog!! No training technique or book is the last word on the subject. Great techniques come from many sources and the Monks are one great source. Thanks for such good reading."
5,A must for 1st time puppy owners,"Far and away the best puppy training book out. Using the simple and suprisingly obvious methods, our Golden became the perfect companion. Anything but a 5 star rating for this book is ludicrous."
5,Great book!,"This book is loaded with detailed information necessary to successfully raise a puppy. From the first night you have your puppy away from its mother, to how to train him/her, to how to recognize aggression in a dog's stance, it is a great resource."
3,Good but not for me.......,"This book is good for those like these methods. I prefer to ""clicker train"". I did although think it has a clear veiw of its training methods and if you are that sort of trainer I reccomend this book. I did find though that possibly they referred to their other book a little too much. Some of their ideas made sense but as for their ""scruff shakes"" I did not find very workable as well as uncomfortable to carry out(i tried). If you are looking for positive training methods I do not recommend this book(try Ian Dunbar). However if you beleive in ""traditional"" methods of dog training try it, I think you will like it."
3,Not for Dachshunds,This book is ok. It has some useful advice that I have tried on my dachshund but it is mostly for big dogs like German shepherds. So I give it 3 stars as I was expecting more over all for any dog in general. Dachshunds are kind of hard headed. I have learned the most about dog training from Caesar Millan The Dog Whisperer. I hope I am spelling that right. I have seen his shows on tv and he is amazing with dogs! And the dog psychology works. Look him up I think Amazon has books by him as well.
5,A Great Aproach,"If you are looking for a wonderful aproach to raising that cute little puppy, this book is for you. It is 10x more informative and useful than 99% of the puppy-raising books out there. The monks' philosophy of kindness, compassion, and lots of love will result in a new best friend is a wonderful way to train your new dog. Buy it today for the best way to raise a dog!"
5,"If you love dogs, read this book!","This book has been available for some time. I bought my copy more than twelve years ago. I found it fascinating, especially the chapter on the Puppy Aptitude Test (on how to evaluate a puppy for its likely adult behavioral characteristics). There is currently much disagreement with the monks' methodology on the part of some trainers today who believe that an owner should always reward and never punish. But there is much in this volume to inform and delight anyone who is about to purchase and raise a puppy -- whatever the breed. A classic!"
4,The Art of Raising a Puppy,"Very interesting and informative--these people have alot of experience doing what they do, so their point ofview is worth looking at."
5,Great book,"I ordered this book upon the advice of our breeder when the puppies were about 2 weeks old. No one is really thinking about serious training when there is still another 6-8 weeks before you receive your newest family member. This book was wonderful. The authors used real dogs and puppies as examples to explain their training techniques. It was well written and easy to understand. Even though we had raised puppies in the past, it had been some time since we'd had a new pup. The content was extremely informative and insightful as to what a dog may be thinking or experiencing. Every time you think, oh-I know all about that, this book could prove you wrong! Even if you only learned a few new things from this book ,it would be worth it to review what goes on inside the mind of a puppy and what can I do to make him the best he can be."
5,Everyone's puppy is described in this book!,"How wonderful to have such patient and understanding help in a sometimes frustrating endeavor, raising a puppy. The Monks' advise can be applied immediately, and really works"
5,Very good puppy book,Lots of useful information even though my puppies were both from the pound. Very nice ToC and formating for Kindle.Worth the money!
3,The Monks Know Dogs-Does The Book Help You Train Your Dog?,"When deciding to buy a puppy, this book was recommended by the breeder. We have owned dogs before, but wanted help in training a dog the ""right way"" this time. This book was helpful. We found enough useful information in the book to get started. The Monks love and understanding of dogs gets your mind in the correct ""place"". Instead of reacting to your new puppy with habit or first instinct, you learn a new way of viewing the animal's nature and needs. As far as actual training methods or how-to's, it didn't go far enough for me, however. It does cover the most basic things, but the Monks second book is required reading if you want to fully train your new pet."
5,Great advice and good read!,"This book explains in detail and easily understandable language the respect and training a dog deserves. The training methods advocated are rational, clearly described and are designed to establish a lifelong relationship between two companions."
4,Puppy training,This will be the second puppy I will train with their method. My first dog died but she was potty trained within weeks using the crate and lots of play time. You will need other training too but it is a way to get off on the right track with a puppy. The advice if followed is GOLD.
5,Buy it and share it!,This is a wonderful book that I have shared with others....just expect that you will wait to get it back. LOL!! Great book!!!
5,A must-read (or must-listen) for any dog owner,"I admit it: I didn't want a dog. My husband purchased this book as part of his campaign for Owning a Dog, and when we finally got our 3-month old puppy (Lab/Shepherd/hound mix), he utilized everything he'd learned from this book.The result: An exceptionally well-behaved dog who now garners compliments from friends and family on her manners and overall good behavior. She's excellent around other animals (we also have cats) and babies/small children. And now, I have to admit that I can't imagine not having our dog.Is this book your answer to everything about dogs, from puppyhood to old age? Probably not. Is this book a substitute for you being a responsible dog owner? No. But it is definitely a book every puppy (or dog) owner should have, and learn from."
5,Required reading for all dog owners,"This book should be required reading for all potential dog owners regardless of breed, owner age or if you've owned a dog before. Clearly written, easy to understand and sensibly presented. The information in this book will give you good insight on how your puppy's mind works, what your puppy needs from you and why the puppy behaves as it does. Save yourself a lot of grief and aggravation in dealing with easily resolved behavior problems. If you read this book and implement it's suggestions your dog will grow up being a better companion and you, a better person. Remember, there's no such thing as a dumb dog - only dumb owners."
5,Worth the read -,Precurser for Cesar's foundation - good for beginners; excellent refresh for long time dog owners.
5,Read this book BEFORE getting a dog.,"This book is invaluable. Not only will it teach you how raise your dog, but will also show you how to pick the right dog! That's right, how to pick a puppy that won't turn into some 4-legged-psycho."
2,FatMax not working,Unit arrived well packed and ready for use. When I installed the enclosed batteries there was no response. I purchased three new batteries and still no power in the unit. I double checked the battery configuration (plus vs minus) and they were installed properly. Still no power to the unit.Would like to get another unit but Amazon indicates that a replacement is not an option.What a way to do business!Neil Blum
3,Asimov Didn't Write This,"In his autobiography, ""I, Asimov"", Isaac makes it clear he did not write this book. It was put together by someone else, and his name was attached to it through some kind of contractual mumbo-jumbo. That being said, it is an entertaining book."
4,An entertaining read that some won't be able to put down!,"This book is a good read and you will sometimes be amazed by some of the facts that are contained within it. How many people do you know that wrongly believe that the Titanic resulted in the greatest loss of human life at sea!Sure some people will say that some of the facts contained are incorrect or have been disproved. Remember that this book was originally published in the 1970's and in that time research and technology has resulted in new discoveries been made in many fields such as medicine, space, etc.So as long as you keep this in mind and take the time to double check any facts contained in this book before getting into any arguments or taking bets, you should be OK.Overall, a good read which many of your friends will be delighted to borrow."
1,"outdated, biased, and full of errors","This book was definately not what I expected it to be. First of all, many of the so called ""facts"" have been reversed in more recent years by new findings in science (this book seems to have been written during Carter's presidency). Furthermore, Isaac shows a strong tendency to be biased in his views, sometimes in favor, other times against certain cultures. Last but not least, the book is full of errors, that calling them ""facts"" would be an understatement. Look elsewhere, there are many better fact books around."
5,Super Duper Case,This bow case is tougher than a Mexican prostitute. It can really take a pounding (the case I mean). You won't be disappointed with either one. ;-)I used my case to fly from NY to Nebraska roundtrip and thee was no damage. I totally trust this case.
5,Really goo service,Très intéressant. Pas l'obligation d'acheter une tasse au plein cot. Remplacement du couvercle seulement pour presque rien. Mes tasses étaient encore très bonnes c'est juste le couvercle qui était brisé. Rapidité de livraison. SUPER. Je recommande fortement.
3,"Works fine, but poor design","I got this alarm clock because it looked like it had a support for the ipod. Reviews for other models say the connection breaks off over time, so I thought this would be a better design. It actually turns out the little back support doesn't come in contact with my ipod. Not a big deal, but slightly disappointing. The other thing is the light display. It is pointed at an angle that makes it tough to read on any surface equal to or higher than my bed. Similarly, the lighting on the time display is horrible. The back - light is way too bright. I have decided to keep the light off and use my old alarm clock for the clock. The ipod functions and alarm works really well so I am not going to return it, but I probably would buy something else if I had a chance to do it over."
2,"OK, but very hard to use","OK, first, the good:The build quality is pretty good, and the sound is good, the radio works well, and it interfaces easily with the iPod.The bad?The controls are HORRIBLE. The buttons have no feedback to know if you have pressed them, the alarm is really difficult to set, and very hard to know whether you have set it correctly - it's a crap-shoot to know whether the alarm will go off in the morning. I would not recommend this as an alarm-clock, it's a pretty good iPod dock though."
4,"Great space-saver, but the sound can't compare.","I love how this looks and fits in our super-tiny bedroom. I bought it to replace the giant mid-90s stereo+100CD player we were using. While I love the design and the ability to listen to the ipod while folding laundry, etc, the sound just can't compare to the bigger wood-box speakers we had before. So it's a compromise, but a good one. The alarm feature is great because you can set it to play on any song/podcast. The remote is really handy for snoozing too! Someday when we can afford it, I'd go for an upgrade, but the price, size , and operability made this a good product for us for now."
3,Terrible Experience,"To put this in the same class toy as lego should be criminal. Key pieces of equipment fall apart on a regular basis, the instructions are poor and no 5 year old would EVER put this together. I HIGHLY doubt a Mega Blok engineer could keep this thing together. It's like stacking dominoes, once a piece falls off it just starts tumbleing all over the place. To call them interlocking pieces is a joke. I thought I could enjoy putting this together with my son on Christmas Day NOT!!!!! I'll never buy another mega blok product."
3,I wish these reviews were here before I bought this!,"""Santa"" brought this to my 7 yr old son for Christmas. It was one of his main 'got to haves'. It is near to impossible to put together! After working on it for hours, we have never finished it completely! You get so far and then the whole thing comes tumbling down. Most lego type sets are a little frustrating for small kids but this one is even to hard for the parents. I gave it the 3 star for fun because my son loves power rangers so much and he does play with the litte figures. But if you can only play with the figures, that makes this waaayyyy toooo pricey!"
2,Absolute Pain In The $%#@!!!,"I have two boys ages 4 and 7 and they love anything associated with power rangers so this was a no brainer purchase. The four of us sat down to put this thing together and it was the worst toy assembly experience I've ever had. It'll take you forever to figure out how to assemble this thing due to no instructions, only confusing diagrams. After you DO get it SOMEWHAT assembled, you'll have to restrain yourself from smashing it against the wall cause it WON'T STAY TOGETHER!! I totally regret buying this crap."
1,What a joke!,"This toy comes with a 31 page booklet of diagrams which NO ONE can figure out, let alone a child. The pieces do not interlock like Legos and the whole experience has been a frustrating one! We will end up using the power ranger pieces with our Legos and probably throw out the rest. What a waste of money and effort! I will never buy Mega Bloks again."
3,Lots of trouble to build!!,"My 5 year old son received this for Christmas and him and my husband have been trying for hours to get it put together. There are 1,000's of small pieces which make it very confusing to find the right piece you need. I would just keep this in mind before you by this for a child under 7 years old. It's very frustrating!!"
2,Put it back in storage,"We bought this toy for our son - a mistake. After I spent over an hour putting it together, he played with it for 5 mintues before it all began to fall apart. We put it in a storage contaianer and put it in the closet. It is too difficult for him to try to fix and it won't keep together long enough for him to enjoy. Maybe when he's older... much older!"
5,"A clear, sensible practical guide to detoxing","I've read so much hype about detoxing that it was really refreshing to read this book. It's clear, concise and authoritative. The author obviously knows exactly what she's talking about and doesn't throw in any trendy gimmicks or ridiculous claims. I followed her one-month plan and can honestly say I have never felt better in my life (at least not since I was a kid!!). It goes beyond the mere physical too but encourages you to look at your whole life - emotionally as well as physically. I de-cluttered and that made a huge difference. Well worth reading - and following!!"
3,Great Unit BUT Software Problems,If you intend to just use Record Now software it works great. If you intend to use the packet writing software DLA you better look elsewhere. If Veritas DLA is installed you cannot load a DVD movie. Support tells you to uninstall DLA when you want to load a DVD and reinstall when you need DLA support. This renders this unit useless if you need both functions. Support indicates they know about the problem but cannot tell you when a fix will be available. With support of all media formats this unit is superior. Until they resolve the software issues it is not.
2,Loved it when it worked,"Had the drive for about 2 years, then it won't write anymore. Reads fine, but it won't create a disk. Run the diagnostics - no clue what the issue is. On a side note, this drive was pretty loud."
1,Another owner with a dead drive after a year,Luckly my original drive died before the warrenty. The second drive has started to give write errors. It will not complete writing a DVD. At least I got 2 years (1 for each drive) before having to go get another one.I will never buy another Sony optical drive again. They are overpriced and provide crappy performance.
1,These drives have hardware issues!!! Please Read!,"I have owned this drive since 10/2002 and am actually on my second unit now because the first one stopped being able to read/write DVD-RW and DVD+RW/R formats (but still would read and write DVD-R). I spent a month going back and forth with Sony and it was only my background in network engineering that enabled me to convince sony engineers that the drive did in fact have a failure. They finally replaced the drive with a completely new unit and that unit has been fine - until today... Now, of course, the unit is no longer in warranty so I am screwed. Just another example of Sony's recently waning quality. See for yourself if you must, but I am buying the Pioneer A04 like I should have in the first place. I have had it with Sony!"
4,Fun toy,This is one of the better Power Ranger mega bloks I have bought for my 3yrs old.He has been playing with the bloks sine he was 2 1/2 yrs. The parts are very easy to assemble and he was able to put each piece back when they come apart.I glued the smaller parts on the base so we do not loose them and makes it frustrating for a 3yr to play with. It is very well designed and he loves playing with it.
3,A little hard to follow,"This DVD will definitely get your heart pumping, although I found it a little hard to follow. Many times, I couldn't do the dance-like moves, and resorted to just stepping up and down to the beat of the music."
3,Not for beginners,"As an intermediate student of yoga, I found the workouts on this DVD were extremely fast. A good workout for someone pressed for time. The lower body workout was mostly a standard yoga set that most beginning students learn, sun salutations etc. The other two sets had movements and positions that I've never seen before. I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner. The DVD only explains the basic positions with still pictures. The instructors don't really explain the poses well enough for a beginner. For an intermediate yoga student pressed for time, this makes an adequate DVD to have in your collection."
4,Somewhat difficult for beginners,"The actual work outs were GREAT, however, I felt that some of the poses were very hard for someone like myself who is a total newcomer to yoga. I have had this DVD for about 3 weeks now and finally I am getting a good sense of the poses. Also, I found the workouts to be rather short. (20 minutes each for abs, upper, and lower)"
3,Agreed -- not for beginners,"I am a fan of both Deason and Yee but would have to agree with the previous reviews that this is not a DVD for someone who is a beginner, especially for those who have not done any kind of resistance or physical training. Without the support of upper body, lower body and core strength, this DVD is not much instructional use for a beginner.For beginners, Deason's Yoga for Weight Loss is much better (DVD format) -- especially for those who have never done an exercise program and have little core strength and are looking to improve strength, tone and stamina."
2,Not for beginers,"I got this video with the understanding that it will provide me with the basics of yoga, and that I will progressively become better at yoga and more comfortable practicing it. The video provides a series of on screen explanations of the basic yoga poses with a little graphic. It is very hard to read on the screen, the colot is too light, and helps very little. The video is very good for those who have been practicing yoga for a while, and have a good understanding of it. I tried all the programs contained in the video, with no success at being able to follow the motions, and very little knowledge of how to do it. I had to buy a basic yoga book to understand the yoga positions in detail. The DVD is now sitting on the shelf. I do not recommend thid DVD for beginners. This is a more advanced video."
4,Great workout,"As much as I like this work-out, I found that I couldn't keep up with the pace in the upper body work-out. It seemed to be going too fast for beginners.Overall though, I really enjoy the work-out and it's a challenge."
2,"Agree with others, NOT GOOD FOR BEGINNERS","This is a lovely, visually beautiful DVD. But the reason I picked it up is because it said ""For Beginners"". It is way too fast paced, they act like you're suppose to know what each pose is and they keep gliding on to different poses even before you can catch your footing with the previous one.Also, there is a lot of talking/interviewing that was a bit long winded. As someone short on time, I just needed a 1-2 minute intro then on to the actual exercises, I found myself fast forwarding all their talking about how they became interested in Yoga etc.This would be a good dvd for someone intermediate and someone who enjoys the background interviews on the instructors and Yoga itself."
3,Yoga or Tai Chi?,"I just tried this DVD last night. I had the videos from before, but haven't used them for a few years. I tried the upper body workout. I'm not sure this is really for beginners as they move through the positions quickly and it makes it difficult if you aren't flexible enough to fully implement the positions. If they blast through the exercises, how does a beginner become more flexible without holding the position for more than a second? I would have preferred more info on the positions and how to prepare your body for performing them correctly and safely. The videos seemed more paced for beginners than this DVD. Almost seemed like tai chi more than yoga."
2,Be on your toes,"I took a Yoga class at my gym for about a year and a half. My mom bought this DVD for me for christmas. They change the positions to quickly, it was not relaxing at all. You are supposed to hold your position for a least a minute. You really need to be on your toes for this video so don't expect to be relaxed when it's over. I found it to be very annoying and haven't watched it since."
2,NOT for beginners,"other than this DVD not being what it states it is (""for beginners"") i have no other gripes about it. however if you do not know ANY yoga and ARE a ""beginner"" stay away from this one as they move through the poses so fast you will never be able to keep up.however, if you are not a beginner this may be the DVD for you.but a title should really tell the truth about the contents."
1,Poor Quality,I was very disappointed with this set after I washed it. We kept it because my son loved the pattern on the quilt but I will not buy this brand again. The sheets are very poorly constructed. The pillow case does not have straight/square seems (which I've actually never seen in a sheet set) and the hem on the flat sheet is sown so that it twists (and you can't get it flat even with an iron) when it comes out of the dryer. It just looks like a wadded mess on the bed topped off with a crooked pillowcase.
2,Looks Faded,"I was disappointed when we first opened this package, as the comforter looks kind of faded. I understand bedding will fade over time and with washing, but this appeared that way from the get-go.Other than that, it's comfortable, fits the toddler bed just fine and my son likes it a lot. I just expected it to be as brightly and boldly colored as the picture on Amazon.I would be totally satisfied with it if the price reflected the quality, but in this case, I would never again spend that amount of money on an inadequate product."
2,ENOUGH!!!,"I really dont think this book is any different from other books about ADOLF HITLER. The same style where Hitler is already the bad/crazy/stupid man and it just needs to be justified!!! NO. So far, I still cant find a book that does not start by telling me ""HITLER IS EVIL!"" Once this idea is presented, then Hitler is judged from a one side prespective. Many books have basically said the same thing over and over. nothing really is unique. If you have read two or more books about Hitler already, then i say dont expect you will get something fresh from this one. Also,you must read Mein Kampf before you read any analized Hitler books to fully understand it."
1,Poor Quality,"I mistakenly purchased it from someone who imports the blurays from the UK and sales them here on Amazon. The set I received was of very poor quality. The film looks as if it was just copied over from DVD and put on a blueray disk. Very grainy picture, it's to my belief most region free or UK imports are pirated movies. Do not be fooled, quality is not the same."
2,Batman Legacy Review,I was disappointed to find out that these were VHS tapes. No where in the description does it say that these are VHS. I sent them back.
2,JUST BUY THE FIRST BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS.,"FIRST OF ALL THE BOXED SET IS REALLY NOT WORTH IT, AND FRANKLY ONLY THE FIRST TWO MOVIES ARE THE BEST, THE FIRST BATMAN IS REALLY A FIVE STAR MOVIE, BATMAN RETURNS IS ANOTHER FIVE STAR MOVIE, BATMAN FOREVER A 2 STAR MOVIE I MEAN COME ON VAL KILMER AS BATMAN(HA HA HA) HE WAS THE WORST BATMAN AND THE MOVIE WAS TOO CAMPY AND NOT DARK AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, THEN BATMAN AND ROBIN 1 STAR MOVIE I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKE GEORGE CLOONEY AS BATMAN (OMG!) HE AND VAL KILMER WERE THE TWO WORST BATMANS, MICHAEL KEATON WAS THE BEST BATMAN, JACK NICHOLSON WAS THE BEST JOKER, DANNY DeVITO WAS THE BEST PENGUIN, AND MICHELLE PFEIFFER WAS DEFINATELY THE BEST AND GOOD LOOKING CATWOMAN EVER, SO IN CONCLUSION STICK WITH THE FIRST TWO BATMAN MOVIES AND SKIP BATMAN FOREVER AND BATMAN AND ROBIN."
4,Batman and Batman Returns Rules but not the other 2 Batman films,Batman and Batman Returns are the real meaning of Batman and how a Batman film should be made. Batman Forever and Batman and Robin were some of the worst superhero movies I haver ever seen. Batman Forever is not comepletly terrible but Batman and Robin was a peice of trash. In Batman Forever and Batman and Robin they were tring to make them funny and it made the movies just turn out plain bad. I sure wish Tim Burton would have directed Batman Forever and Batman and Robin because he did a great job on Batman and Batman Returns.
4,Not a bad Blu-Ray set at all!,"The quality of the video and sound on these discs is quite a bit better than their DVD counterparts. If you like the older Batman films, then these are about the best quality ones you're going to find."
2,"Good value, but the quality is terrible.","I'll admit that the price is cheap. Having all four films for less than $10 is great, but upon watching the first disc, I find that the quality of the transfer is absolutely terrible. Lots and lots of pixelation artifacts, especially when there's black on the screen, and let's face it, BATMAN was not a brightly lit film. The quality is barely, BAREly above VHS. I feel like they hooked a VCR up to a DVD recorder and had at it. I'm not even talking about grain (which I would expect from an older film transfer), but rather poor resolution. There are no solid diagonal lines, everything is blocky. The video looks like an SVCD that was poorly upconverted to DVD.It's good value, if you're just looking for an affordable way to complete your collection, but if you're used to DVD-quality video, you will be disappointed..."
4,Batman Anthology,They are corny but fun and dated you all know the silly last two. Have fun watching them over time I have a hard time picking movies with so many to watch in my collection.
2,DON'T BUY IT!,"Although all of these movies are extremely enjoyable (it can even be fun to laugh at ""Batman and Robin""), buying this collection at this point in time would be a serious mistake and I wouldn't want you to waste your money. I see that the sales are this are quite strong right now, #300 out of all of the discs available on Amazon, probably because of the new Batman movie (which looks quite good).There are rumors going around that Tim Burton recently recorded audio commentary on the first two films and it has been confirmed that Joel Schumacher is working on a restored director's cut of the third film, with many of the darker elements of the story that were deleted put back in. Obviously, then, we can be pretty sure that these films will come out quite soon with better treatment on DVD. This will probably coincide with the DVD release of Batman Begins late this fall. I think it's worth the wait, personally."
5,BATMAN COLLECTION:FOUR FILM FAVORITES,"This collection has been great fun for my kids. All four, from ages 4-9 enjoy watching this video together! It may be the oldest of the Batman series, but they don't know that and love it all the same."
3,First 2 movies are amazing...,"All things come to an end, good or bad, we all know that. Batman, Batman Returns, and parts of Batman Forever hold up the lackluster star vehicles for Batman & Robin. The first two radiate with powerful storytelling and unerring capacity for mystery and intrigue. Batman Forever changes speed and flips to a comic rendition of Laurel & Hardy while introducing Robin. Some of Tim Burton's handiwork keeps it tolerable. Batman & Robin - well, the only good thing about is Uma Thurman who plays ultra-sexy ""Poison Ivy."" I do toast a cup to Alfred who's remained a reason to see the last two films.Robert Eldridge (...)"
5,Best Bluray transfer!!!,"From the reviews and from what I have seen on other bluray transfers, this is the best one yet. The brightness and clarity in the first Batman was superb and the other are just as good (Not sure about Batman Forever or Batman and Robin, I can't bring myself to watch those. They are so terrible)...."
5,Batman,This is a gift so I can't really review it.. price is great it was on time and perfectly packaged
5,"Go ahead, you know you want to","I really only like the first two that Micheal Keaton and Tim Burton did but the others are good comedies to watch occasionally. Batman & Robin keeps me laughing the whole time. So if you're lookig for good action you have the first two movies and then you can kick back , relax and laugh at the next two movies."
3,A great beginning to a horrible end.,"All things come to an end, good or bad, we all know that. Batman, Batman Returns, and parts of Batman Forever hold up the lackluster star vehicles for Batman & Robin. The first two radiate with powerful storytelling and unerring capacity for mystery and intrigue. Batman Forever changes speed and flips to a comic rendition of Laurel & Hardy while introducing Robin. Some of Tim Burton's handiwork keeps it tolerable. Batman & Robin - well, the only good thing about is sexy Uma Thurman. I do toast a cup to Alfred who's remained a reason to see the last two films..."
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This....,"I loved Batman when I was a kid. I remember the ""batmania"" that was 1989. You remember ? There were Batman figures, posters, shirts, candy, and toys all over the place. That's one period that I wish I could go back to. I still have 2 toy Batmobiles, a toy Batwing, a model Batwing, and a couple of posters. I even have the comic adaptation and novel as well as the trading cards. The first Batman movie, as well as the second, Batman Returns, is what Batman is supposed to be. Don't pay any attention to Batman Begins and Dark Knight. They're nothing compared to the Michael Keaton films. They're dark, but not too dark. They're really fun and Jack Nicholson as the Joker is pure creepy perfection. I can't think of anything bad about these movies....well, the first two movies, anyway. The music is outstanding. The theme was even used as the opening and closing theme music for the animated series."
3,What kind of a world do we live in?,"Batman. If you're a completest, get this set. If you're not, well my advice is this. With Batman Begins on DVD, which is arguably the best Batman film to date, all you really need is Batman Begins, Batman, & Batman Returns. Nobody ever needs to see Batman Forever or Batman & Robin again. They're horrible & not worth watching unless you're related to Jim Carrey or George Clooney & need to tell them you saw it. If you really want the best Batman experience, get the newest film, the 2 Tim Burton films, & the 4 volumes of The Animated Series. You won't get better than that. I'd have given this set 20 stars if it included what I just described, minus the 2 Schumacher wastes. But instead, just 3 stars. Good special features, though."
1,"Don't Bother... unless you love campy ""films""","These films are lousy. Namely because A) They don't have the same actor playing batman, B) the villians might as well have been that stupid clown from spawn, they all sucked C)Who honestly thought any of these people took the Batman legacy with an ounce of seriousness?Pathetic!The cartoon series was more serious than these ""films"" were."
3,Just re-release the first two movies,"Those are the only two Batman movies which actually made the viewing audience want to see them (and the reason for the stars). Tim Burton took the time to understand his character.As long as I live, I will never understand how DC Comics...etc thought that turning Bob Kane's classic avenger into a stand up comedian. It even makes the 1960's TV show look high brow by comparison.What on earth is posessing Hollywood if they think the latter two train wrecks of film and sequins are even remotely up to par? Bless Michael Keaton for sitting out of the latter two films.I'm unable to give this entire package higher than three stars because the studios intentionally tampered with a fan favirote."
5,Outstanding movies...,Product shipped and received on time. Outstanding quality and for a great price too!
4,Batman began here,While I did not like all of the BATMAN movies especially the campy TV one. I found some of them interesting in how different actors approached the project. I was given a gift card for Xmas and I felt it was worth the money I did not spend personally. Holy Arnold Batman now he is The Govenator.
3,The first two are good.,I would buy this if I could get it without Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. I just can't support giving Joel Schumaker any money for those endeavors.
4,Batman and Batman Returns [awesome]... 3-4 [not so awesome],"Well, How can I say this.. I remember back in 1989 when I first saw Batman with Micheal Keaton... it was most probably one of the best Superhero movies ever ....It was followed by another movie which was almost as good known as Batman Returns, with a cast like Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny Devito and Micheal Keaton what more could we expect but pure perfection... ..:)The last two, ...Plain and simple they were like kids stories. Another loss was the fact that Tim Burton did not direct them. His dark loomy presence was not felt and they seem to be geared move towards children... the magic was lost.. Final say I recommend this because of the first 2 movies."
3,"Batman, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly...","Okay we all know that by the time they got to making Batman & Robin (Batman IV)it was just a total shambles.But, these are all ""Special Edition"" versions (2 Disc Sets) which means loads of extras (about 18 hours worth to be exact!).Granted, if these were single disc editions I would probably only get the first two movies individually.I say wait for the price to drop to around the $20 - $25 mark and the snap it up.The extras do make it worth while."
3,It's a bargain!,"This was the only way I would add any of these four Batman installments to my collection. The movies are entertaining, but horrid and inconsistent compared to the reboot represented by Batman Begins and Dark Knight. The latter movies have a permanent position in my collection. This set might get a second viewing before I use it's space for something better."
3,Just 2 and half good movies!,"I bought this product since having the first 4 films that were produced for Batman, was a good idea. To be honest, the second and third movies are my fave on this box set, the first one is ok but is not the best. And the last one, is a very bad movie, batman and robin is the worst movie on the Batman Movie Saga. It is unbeliavable that the movie was directed by Joel S. which was present on the third film which is the best for these set of movies, but of course since Tim Burton was involved on Batman forever probably that was Joel S looked good on the production of the third movie"
5,The Kobayashi Review,I think this is really awesome. I had a hard time finding the ones I didn't have. But then I saw this. All four for a good price. I am really happy with this.I also find that double sided DVDs are pretty interesting too. So long as are not lying around.
3,A declining film series,"This series as a whole deserves an average grade becuase it starts out wonderfully with a great director (Tim Burton) and ends with Joel Shumacher sucking the life out of it. The first two films have themes and actual characters. The last two films are empty, but they have a ton of explosives and high-profile actors hamming it up for no good reason. If possible, try to find a set with just Batman and Batman Returns. Then you get your money's worth."
3,Batman ON DVD! But is it worth it?,"I can personally say that I am a big fan of Batman and Batman Returns. I find these two Tim Burton films as wonderful pieces of pop cinema. In, Batman it doesnt go for camp and trys to take the Batman legend seriously. Batman Returns goes even further, and explores the characters of Catwoman and Batman. It's hard to find that in commercial film. As for Batman Forever, it rates a C+. There's plenty of eye candy, but not much else. It is however a good popcorn muncher. Batman & Robin is pretty bad, but not as bad as some people think. I do wish it was on Mystery Science Theatre, though. This box set doesn't contain any new extras. All it is is the ones released a few years ago with just production notes. Buy the first two seperatly, but if you're patient just remember there will probably be special edition versions in a few years."
4,great package,"If you like the old style batman, then this is for you. It containes all four of the original Batman movies in a nice neat package."
4,Good gift,"This is a good gift if you have a Batman fan in your life. I can't say if the films are good, because I haven't seen them. I just loved that 4 movies were in one package. The gift was well received!"
3,OK Blu-ray set,"The sound on all the movies is great! The video on all the movies is great except for the first Batman which is very disappointing. The first Batman is no way near the video quality of the other three films. WHY???? That is bizarre if you ask me.Also, why no digital copy for ALL the movies???? There is only a digital copy of Batman.Finally, the box itself that these discs come in is awful, IMO.Now Warner has announced a stand alone blu-ray of Batman as well."
2,"Doesn't have ""Kiss From A Rose music video""","I love Seal, so why no music video. There's everything else. I'm very dissapointed. other extras are ok I guess."
3,half of this set is good,"let's get down to business. first of all, tim burten, what were they thinking hiring him to make batman. IT'S A COLOR COMIC BOOK TIM, BUT YOU WANTED TO MAKE IT ALL BLACK AND WHITE. thankfully batman forever came out and changed my life, pay close attention if you can see a young arnold as mr. freeze in this. The great part of this set is that we can finally see chris o donnel do kung fu on his wet laundry in CRYSTAL CLEAR DVD FORMAT. take it from me once you see robin adjust the clothesline with his toes you become very unsatisfied with you own life, and there is a lot of headaches from that point on and a lot of feelings of loneliness. see you at the movies!"
2,bat blu,does anyone know how to make this blu ray appear on ps3 as widescreen? I absolutely hate a full screen movie -- help...
1,upwards to 65 dollars? Really?,"I saw the First two movies at a Kmart in a ""2 in 1"" set exactly like this package. $7. Later that week, the other two movies with the same kind of packaging for $5.No way in HELL would any human pay this much for something you can get for under $20.Thats all I have to say on that."
5,Perfect,"I bought this set for a christmas present, and it came a day early. Totally worth it, especially since this is well over $100 in stores. Will buy from here again :)"
5,Batman Fan's Order It Now!,"Makes the original Batman movie look really clear. In my opinion these are more cartoonish and kinda colorful and entertaining. I think the newer Batman movies (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight) are much better than these but still should be in every Batman fan's collection."
2,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"A few years ago I would have surely bought this set but know, after realizing how little the actor who played Batman mattered in this anthology and after seeing Batman Begins and feeling it marks the start of the definite Batman series, I think I'll pass on this one."
2,"Quality is great, movie is bad","Don't like the story and how the movie was shoot, but the quality was perfect."
1,Buy this if you want it for the looks....,Because it sure as hell won't be for the movie themselves. The Last two movies are garbage. First two are golden. Just buy the first two and buy a ticket to Batman Begins.
1,The original is the only good one. See the new movies instead!,"Please do not waste your time buying the Batman Anthology, especially not on Blu-Ray. I'm sure it will only be more horrible in high definition.The first movie, with Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as The Joker, will always have a place in my heart as the first real Batman movie. It was a pretty good one, as well, even though it appears to be a low-budget film.The other three movies aren't worth watching, whether you've seen them or not. You will be better off spending your time waiting for another Christopher Nolan Batman movie (Director of ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"").Those two movies have been awesome to watch. I saw the first one at a Drive-In (as an afterthought, no less! They always showed two movies at the Drive-In), and the second at home on my HD TV. Either way blows the older movies out of the water, and these are actually interesting."
1,Warner is nuts,"1 okay movie, 1 somewhat okay movie and 2(at least 2) bombs and Warner's suggested retail is $130, it is not even close to being worth the $85 Amazon wants for it now. The set is worth about $44 total and that is being very gracious in my estimation. Mark my words in a year or so this will be hitting barging bins all over the place."
5,Batty Great,"Was a great offer when i got it, not so expectacular as the last ones, but quite interesting if you travel in time."
2,original batman series,because i am a hard core comic book fan i love these films but i realise the acting in all of them is corny and pretty terrible i would say buy this product if you are really into the comic super hero films and you will probably enjoy them every once in a while. Plus given how good the new batman films are i can not rate these films any higher.
5,I loved the old Batman movies,"This blu-ray set is really good, you get all the old Batman movies in it. Its the same disc as the single release blu-rays so don't expect anything extra that aren't on those. It is cheaper to get them all in this set and for me was worth it."
3,Batman Collection Film,"I like the convenience of having all four of the films on one DVD, but it is difficult trying to find each movie on the DVD. The menu is a bit hard to deal with."
4,Here we go again with a great voice!,Nat King Cole with his perfect pitch is so well worth listening to. Granted the tunes are old but for the burgeoning boomer generation they'll be very pleased.
4,"A Very Good, Consistent CD","This is a very good, consistent CD. I've rated over half of the tracks (eight out of 15) as Very Good, and the remainder as Good (I use Media Player's five star rating system where two stars (not three stars) is OK). My specific track ratings are:1. Love Is Here to Stay -- 4 Stars2. Handful of Stars -- 3 Stars3. This Can't Be Love -- 4 Stars4. Little Street Where Old Friends Meet -- 3 Stars5. Autumn Leaves -- 4 Stars6. Let's Fall in Love -- 4 Stars7. There Goes Me Heart -- 4 Stars8. Dinner for One, Please, James -- 3 Stars9. Almost Like Being in Love -- 3 Stars10. Tenderly -- 4 Stars11. You Stepped Out of a Dream -- 3 Stars12. There Will Never Be Another You -- 4 Stars13. Too Much -- 3 Stars14. Thousand Thoughts of You -- 4 Stars15. If You Said No -- 3 Stars"
2,"Heavy on tolerance, light on information","As much as I love most of the Teaching Company courses, this one was a disappointment. The presenter is engaging, but wastes far too much of the course's time reiterating and emphasizing that terrorism is the acts of a few fanatics rather than the product of mainstream Islam. I was hoping for something informative regarding the various sects and schools of jurisprudence within Islam. Not here, other than a few mentions of the schism between Sunni and Shia. No mention of Alawites or Druze. No explanations of the doctrinal differences or backgrounds between twelvers, Ismailis, or Zaidis, for example. The only revelatory portions of these lectures for me were his discussions of varying customs/laws regarding the treatment of women in different Islamic countries. Bottom line - this course is more an apologia for tolerance of Islam rather than an informative academic course."
4,A gloss over of Alan Watts,For those who have lisened to Alan Watts on tape this book is a reliable reference to many of the diverse ideas that he had. Some of the ideas are given a little more depth which may or may not increase your understanding of what he was trying to present. Because the book is short essays it can be read over and over with a different understanding each time or only reinforcing what you already think about the man and his suggestions.
3,no satisfaction,"""Become What You Are"" is a righteous way of looking for an inner journey. There are several parts that appear to be incomplete."
2,"Good quality, sturdy BUT poor design","It's overall good quality however it's too big for any home office. It's not real leather, and the color is far from brown, it's closer to grape or eggplant skin. Good value for money if you accept the huge size and peculiar color"
5,Perfect,Looked all over locally for Sheaffer K refills.Thank goodness for Amazon.These are a perfect fit for the fat body stainless pen I bought 10 years ago and still use.Maybe the two refills we ordered will get us thru another 20 years!Who knows :)
3,Overpriced for the quality or lack thereof.,"I bought a Big Kahuna a while back (I'm 190 lbs 6') and it did OK until I dropped in late on maybe a 4-5 footer at ""the point"" in NPB. The board creased badly when a landed and after a crease, a board is never the same. Any cheap entry level sponge can and will crease and I now know I should have just done more research. You can find a board with graphite or fiberglass stringers at this price point and it will be able to take much more than this board can. I give it 3 stars because it is a fun board on smaller waves like 2-4 ft where you need more float but it is not a good value at this price."
4,Fairly Good Bodyboard,The product is good it is not as stiff as I would like I purchased it for rehabing my knee to get back on a surfboard works ok. I tried to get customer support from WHAMO and they suck. The vendor I purchased this from was NOT COOL don't buy from him! This is the second order from him and it was the second bad experience so I will not go back. Aloha!
1,If this is a gift - give yourself time to build it!,"We bought this directly from the retail Toys R Us store ($79.99). Our 3 and 5 year olds loved the store display model, so we were happy to get the last one. But, the night before the 3-year old's birthday party, we opened the box and tried to put it together. It had been previously returned, it was missing the instructions, the bag of small parts had been ripped into, and several pieces were missing. We now have to scramble to find something different. Shame on Toys R Us for re-selling items that are missing parts!!!"
4,"This is the ""Brian's Song"" of baseball movies","I first saw this movie some twenty years ago and certain of the images have stuck with me all that time. This is not a baseball movie in the conventional sense so if you're expecting to kick back and enjoy the game, forget it. This movie has the same relationship to baseball as does ""The Natural"". Baseball is the backdrop for two friends, one a pitcher destined for stardom the other a somewhat simple minded roster player, his catcher. Unfortunately for the catcher, played very, very well by a young DeNiro, fate has intervened in the form of Hodgkins disease. The grittiness, competitive nature, raw desire and humor necessary to make it through what he knows will be his last season should be a lesson to us all.I bet in twenty more years I'll still have the memory of Moriarty and DeNiro running across the outfield together with that incredible music in the background. It leaves a lump in my throat. What a fantastic image."
4,A masterpiece of Americana,"Bang the Drum Slowly is quite possibly the best baseball film ever. It rivals Sayles' 8 Men Out and Field Of Dreams and stands alone as a very complex and emotional portrayal of a sick man playing out his dream. Robert DeNiro plays a somewhat reserved character in comparison to his Scorsese roles, and succeeds alongside Michael Moriarity in relaying the deft emotion constructed between the two baseball players. Sports films are always either horrible or excellent (Celtic Pride and Bad News Bears respectively) and this film is far beyond any rote definition of excellency. ZD"
3,WAITING FOR JJ 'S BOOK NOOK CREDIT/REPLY,"I did not accept the tape, ""Bang The Drum Slowly"" and instructed to ""Return to Sender."" I notified Amazon of this and requested a credit to my Master Card. I have not seen this credit and have not heard from JJ's Book Nook.I need your assistance with this transaction. Thank you for your attention.Cathy DuVall1-818-718-1955"
2,"Should be called ""Bang my head slowly""","I'm a transplanted Yankees fan, and heard that this was a good ""Sports"" movie.I've tried to watch this movie 4 or 5 times, and always with the same result.TOTAL BOREDOM!It's almost like they are hiding the fact of his disease from everyone, including the audience.It's just really bad, and really slow and doesn't convey genuine loss or triumph.UPDATE: 8/26/2012I watched the movie again a 6th time, and it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
3,"Half as good as the novel, but not bad.","I've always thought that this movie version of Mark Harris's wonderful novel was overrated. Moriarty is excellent, DeNiro pretty good (though it's not even close to the stunning work he would shortly do for Coppola and Scorsese), but the movie completely missses the tone of the book.... it's a sports tearjerker, and the novel , written in a deliberately un-graceful and very funny style that evokes the atmosphere of the sporting world of the 1950's, goes beyond that. The movie doesn't. The movie never finds a storytelling equivalent to Henry Wiggen's ""voice"" from the novel. It's just another dying-from-a-terminal-illness story, this time in a baseball setting. Taken on those terms, however, it works pretty well, and if you haven't read the novels you'll probably like it more than I do, but the movie just doesn't do justice to the source..."
4,"""So what does your boyfriend do for a living?""","""I don't ask those kinds of questions of a man named 'Ice Pick.'"" This underrated little jem of a comedy still has some of the best dialog out there.I recommend it!"
5,"""Oh my God.....it's Harry!""","And about time, too!!!! The morning I receive notice in my email that it had been released on DVD, I woke with the words, ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", on my mind. I couldn't imagine why these words were floating through my head until, that is, I opened my email.This movie is a whole lotta fun. It's campy, cheeky, and funny. I am so happy that it finally made it to DVD. It's a ""grab your popcorn, and enjoy the ride"" kind of movie! You either love it or you don't. There's no in between!!!! And my hubby and I absolutely LOVE it!"
5,Always Fun,A movie over 20 years old and it will still make you smile.And VHS was still in great shape.
5,Great Movie,This movie is great. It is totaly cheesy and campy wich is to be expected from the actors. There are so many subtle jokes in here you need to watch it more than once to catch them all.
4,DVD was in perfect condition but just slightly disappointed with movei.,"I loved the movie. I had seen it before and remembered it to be extremely funny. Until I saw the movie, I had never liked Cyndie Lauper. She was so little and tiny and funny I now liked her. The movie took much too long with the intro. The real funny parts finally started about 35 minutes into the movie. Jeff Goldblooms performance left a little to be desired although every movie I've seen with him in he acted a little strange. I really don't like his style of acting. All in all, I give it a 4-41/2. I Loved Cyndie. She made the movie. I'm glad I bought it."
4,Surprising gem that hasn't discovered yet.,"Very entertaining!!! Just the right mix of humor, mystery, drama, and suspense. The chemistry between Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum is a plausible stability of the story plot. Peter Falk is irately pleasent off-chute to the dramatic portion of the story. Yes very enjoyable movie."
2,Vibes,Great movie. Arrived weeks earlier than estimated but picture quality is not as good as DVDs I have purcased from other suppliers.
4,Offbeat '80s movie that still has charm.,"Vibes only lasted a few weeks at the box office before Critics tore it to shreds. No one at the time thought a movie starring singer Cindy Lauper could be any good. Despite what the critics thought, Cindy held her own.Jeff Goldblum and Cindy, as well as every other actor really make this film enjoyable to watch, despite its age.Jeff and Cindy are psychics hired by a charming as ever Peter Faulk to use their abilities to find a lost Inca City before another group of baddies do. The City however is not exactly what everyone thinks it is.I dont know why its not on dvd but it should be. Yes, its campy and very '80s but the actors make it believable and actually a joy to watch. A definite lazy Sunday afternoon movie."
4,Vibes an unexpected pleasure,"Vibes is not exactly an A rated movie, but I had seen it in the past and wanted to see it again and have my husband enjoy it also. It is an offbeat subject and very campy. I think all the actors did a fine job and the movie is very entertaining."
2,uummmmm idk bout thiz one,"i mean tha dvd was shipped fast and n very good condition..but i saw it when i waslike 12 n i remeber it beinggood..lol i mean i uv cyndi but she dont really know how to act lol but overall tha movie was aight,..."
1,0 stars,"The title ""Woman Power"" led me to expect the author to encourage women to be strong, confident human beings. Instead she encourages women to be subservient and calculating. She also hurtles accusations and blame toward feminism and women with careers, insisting that both devalue what is ""truly meaningful"" and turn men into wimps. If doing every bit of work in the relationship isn't turning your man into a wimp I don't know what is. This book is not worth reading unless you wish to elevate your blood pressure or become Donna Reed."
1,More irksome preaching from a doctor who isn't!,"Frustrating that ""Dr."" Laura, who is anything but qualified to counsel, gets so much attention and sells so many books. See a qualified therapist, and skip preachy twaddle."
2,"Entertaining, in a sadistic way","Listening to ""Doctor"" Laura is akin to watching a pit bull eat the arm off someone who WILLINGLY sticks it through the fence. I think she looks awful (plastic surgery, ""doctor""?). I end up laughing at EVERYONE who makes it on the air (you have to suspect only those easily cowed are sent through the woodchipper). These poor callers have no strength, their need for help notwithstanding. No one with a whit of self-respect would let this witch verbally batter them. Still, it's entertaining to hear them let ""Doctor"" Laura tear them limb from limb. It's sadistic, but sad. Sometimes you have to turn away whenever these sad sacks look to her to be their domineering, surrogate mommy."
5,AWESOME BOOK!!,"I Think people should stick to the book and not try to put someone down on what they believe in. Whether anyone believes it or not, she is helping people and I'm one of them. If anyone else think they can do better then please go on the radio and we'll listen to you. I think people talk the way they do because they're jealousy and admiration for her and it's tearing you apart that she DR.LAURA IS SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. I have all her books and it has helped me tremendously. If you feel so bad about her show on the radio, then don't listen to her show and don't come on amazon searching for her books. Don't use this means to talk bad about someone else. Before u complain about other people please look at ur life. I love Dr Laura and her books are awesome. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
3,repetitive!,"I loved the proper care and feedings of husbands, but this book, is a work book and a journal. I think it is very repetitive if you have read the first book, plus who has time to answer all of these silly questions. I think that because of the sucess of the proper care book that this book was just a quick money maker. Others with more time and others who may need more help may really enjoy this book."
3,your really don't need it,Woman Power is essentially a workbook to go along with Care & Feeding. It really can't stand alone. Without Care & Feeding it's worthless and to be honest you could do just as well by buying a 99 cent notebook and writing down your observations and admissions after reading Care & Feeding. The only way I'd recommend buying Woman Power is if your bookstore has a buy one get one free say. Care and Feeding is an important book. Woman Power is really just fluff.
5,Take's Your Breath Away,"Full of passion and skill, Oripando lifts your spirits, has your toes tapping and makes your belly clinch. Oripando means ""Kettle of Gold"" which in the gypsy language caló translates to ""The Sun"". EA! are a group of nuevo flamenco 'academics' breathing new fire into Andalucian classics with an uncanny clarity and virtuosity, but at the same time reinventing the flamenco ecosystem with dramatic elements of jazz, world music and even rock styles. Oripando is possibly their finest work and a must-have in the collection of any latin music enthusiast."
2,"Basic, Basic",For a 4 set DVD you would think that the programs would lead up to building a better and repeatable swing. I have a copy of Leadbetter's single DVD which covers everything the $100 dollar 4 set does. It started with the basic's and never took it up a notch. Jim MaCleans 8 step swing is a way better product.
5,Great tool to understand the swing,"I have had taped lessons from a pro previously. At $50 a half hour you really don't get a chance to view the video and understand your own swing. With this tool David takes you through understanding what you taped and gives drills to correct the faults. The DVDs seem to be the same information that is in the software. I have tested other swing analysis software but this is only one that teaches you what to look for and then how to correct it. Others may have more bells and whistles but for me this is all I need. I would like to be able to say I am playing better golf but many of my faults are hard to break and as a once a week golfer my scores have not really improved yet but I have been able to break the Slice, Slice then pull hook problem I had. So that is progress. This software is well worth the price, basically a couple of lessons or rounds of golf."
5,worth the money,I had most of Leaderbetter's golf videos in VHS but I still think it's worth it. The reason is that some computer animation or graphics help me to understand the difference which is better than his old videos.
3,"Terrible film, but good transfer.","Amazon really has ruined reviews by mixing them up, so THIS IS FOR THE BLU-RAY! It has a good transfer that while not perfect, is a huge step up from what I have seen on cable. The studio thankfully did NOT 'grain-rape' this older film and so yes, we have real film grain of the 35mm stock of that era. The picture is somewhat soft, but looks like it should. Many studios are using Digital Noise Reduction to remove grain, resulting in a smeared, wax like picture devoid of life and detail. Thank heavens that did not happen here.Sound is mono and not impressive. But it IS better than the DVD because it is virtually uncompressed.This is a lousy film. Really really bad. Unlike the original, which despite being dated, still stands up as an excellent drama."
1,death wish 2 blueray,i will not buy death wish 2 this is the cut version why cant they put both version of this movie on one blueray dic give people there chosie witch movie to watch the R rated or the UNCUT version.
5,George Stirrup,"I have been waiting for a considerable time to work out where I could get these Movies. I am very happy with them, and will take great pleasure in watching them."
3,Eh.,"Director Winner must be held responsible for the problems with this sequel. It is rather outdated and the actions of the murdering creeps are just so bizarre. They just bounce around and are not believable at all. One more problem is Winner's reoccuring rape scenes which he has in each one of his Death Wish films. These are needlessly gruesome and violent. The music, also, is just plain awful. Satanist Jimmy Page is responsible for the largely outdated and disturbing music."
3,amazon instant video is the uncut 93 minute version,I have watched the AI version and it is the Uncut version with the 5 minutes of deleted scenes. This is not the Dvd 88 minute theatrical release.
1,Bronson's Vigilante Workout,"""Death Wish 2"" (1982) is an inept piece of filmmaking. This contrived sequel looks as though it was photographed, edited and scored by pornographers. Charles Bronson has a few memorable one-liners, but that's about it. Strictly amateur night."
5,Bronson movie set,I love Charles Bronson films. He was very realistic in his portrayal of whatever character he played. I watch them often.
4,For Bronson fans.,"Heavily censored, almost safe enough to watch with your grandparents (if they're open minded enough).If you're a fan of Bronson and the now dated Death Wish series, then buy. I've knocked off one star for censorship and for not including the original Death Wish (1) film.."
2,"eight years after the first , death wish2 comes out to join the action 80's","really this is just an action movie that was made to cash in on the 80's action craze. this has very little to do with the 1974 origanal, which was a serious study of crime and the vigilante mind set! this is just an action movie and while the cast looks like they are sleepwalking through the movie it is fun in the action movie mode(if it is very excessive this time it's because it is just following the trend by this time)!not a great one but it still is better than the last two in the series!"
1,Censorship Sucks!!!,"What's the point of higher capacity formats (ie DVD, Blueray, HD DVD) if not to provide more content, rather than less? Why censor art? I hate it when you go and get something on DVD or Blueray or HD DVD, and what was on the original Laserdisc or VHS set isn't even there! You suck MGM! I hate you! There is no point in having new higher capacity formats given your current methods, other than to make consumers buy them over and over again of course. *sigh* Why would you need them when you provide less content than the VHS delivered? And as for your censoring of my media, well let's just say I think the fact you cut out parts of the movie that existed in the original is unacceptable. This is a pathetic, censored, cut version of the original film, and it should be noted on the front of every DVD you butcher that you butchered it in BOLD PRINT. Just like your foreheads should be labeled with the following I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CUSTOMERS WANT, OR HOW TO MAKE A DECENT PRODUCT FOR THEM!!!"
4,Disappointment!,"I can not understand why an American movie is cropped off to full screen for the American market, and be presented in its original widescreen format for the European market. In addition, certain (obscene) scenes were also cut out from its original version. Shouldn't the audience decide what is too graphic for them? If you want the whole Death Wish picture unedited on DVD, look for it in Europe. Be sure to have a multi-region DVD player that can play European DVDs (Region 2) before you order. It is a cool Charlie Bronson movie, and for people who like the straightforward 70s action without much intrigue, it is a night out!"
3,A violent but realistic thriller,"I have been familiar with death wish to since its original release on HBO. However, I don't like any movie that has important scenes deleted and in this case quite a bit of the violent sexual content was removed. Other than that the movie was fine. If you're Bronson fan you'll like this movie. If you dislike violent criminals you'll love this movie."
2,Vile and disgusting.,Former action superstar Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner made some great (and a few entertainingly not so great) movies together. This is not one of them. The sad fact is that Death Wish 2 is a vile and disgusting pile of cinematic sexual sadism. It features one of the most brutal and graphically disturbing rape sequences ever captured on film. Making matters worse is the grainy porno film production values. An all time low for the Bronson/Winner team. Strictly for fans of I Spit on Your Grave.
3,descent death wish,"I thought this death wish was not a bad one. It had somewhat of a continuous storyline to it. Basically how the punks kill his daughter and the police don't seem too helpful in hunting down the killers. THerefore, he becomes the vigilante and blows away each mugger one by one. This is not a bad movie but the rape scene should be short and concise beacuse it takes away the value of death wish 2. All in all, I would simply recommend buying the VHS version of this film rather than the dvd because it's something which isn't really the greatest death wish but has a good soundtrack with jimmy page. However, I would recommend buying death wish 3 on dvd because that is a real classic!!!!!"
4,Great follow up to the classic 1974 Death Wish!!!,"Between the music, the action, the scenery, the movie is a smash. I think what makes this an effective sequel and movie on itself is the guys they cast as the muggers like Kevin Major Howard, Stuart Robbinson, and Larry Fishburne. They all look sleazy, tough and dangerous. I mean would you like to meet the character played by Kevin Major Howard in a dark alley somewhere in Brooklyn. I think not. In addition, the movie has some great lines it. Definately together with the first it is the best in the series and one of the greatest in the entire genre."
2,Horribe But Irresistible,"To paraphrase Nic Cage's ""chemical superfreak"" from ""the Rock""--""This is probably the most horrible thing I've ever seen."" Yet I am drawn to it, pulled to it. Along with ""Caligula"" this is one movie where after you watch it you feel like you need a shower (fully clothed)."
3,Graphic,"I have to agree with the highlighted review above. This film is very disturbingly graphic in the depiction of the group rape scene. I do have to doubt the validity of that whole scene being there in the first place. It is definitely not for under 18 viewers, and in some cases, not for those weak at heart/ emotions.That being said, overall , it follows as a decent sequel to Death Wish 1. Not a buy, but you can rent it out on a Saturday night when your bored and definitely *NOT* with your loved one or family.."
1,Do not buy - cut version!!,"This is the cut R-rated version of the film - and this despite the fact that an uncut HD master of the film is available from both Netflix and Amazon!I think that on principle all cut films should be boycotted, so please give this release the wide berth it deserves.Why couldn't the publisher give the viewer the option of watching the R-rated or uncut version of the film? This kind of laziness deserves to be published.Also, early reviews of this release suggest that the new HD print has not been used. - A-V-O-I-D !!!"
2,Charles Bronson- 5 movie set,"This set comprising Bronson's action flicks as Deathwish 2/3/4, Mechanic, I shouldn't have bought. Nothing wrong with the action but very dated and with cheesy dialogues. Films in 30 years have moved on, in style of presentationCharles Bronson 5 Movie Gift Box Set (Limited Series)"
1,Not a review of the Blu Ray but the movie,The original DEATH WISH -- VERY loosely based on Brian Garfield's novel -- came out in the same period of time as DIRTY HARRY in the early 1970's when street crime was a very real fear. On that level it worked well. DEATH WISH II is an awful film. I've only watched once and that was one time too many. There is a scene where Bronson's housekeeper is BRUTALLY raped. It is an awful. disgusting sequence. If you are one who hate to see women brutalized then this is one to avoid.
5,"The first""Greatest Hits"" package.","In 1966 the Fabs played the last concert of their career in San Francisco and then started working on what would become ""Sgt.Pepper..."".Since Parlophone had released two L.P.'s a year since 1963,they decided that with no new product ready after the release of ""Revolver"" earlier in the year,they would compile some singles and one unreleased track(at least in England) and put out this engaging collection.The highlights are the singles,""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" , ""She Loves You"",etc.and the aforementioned ""Bad Boy"",available in the U.S. on ""Beatles VI"".The collection was never released in much of the world but is well worthwhile as a collection of hits that had not been released on L.P. theretofore in England.The sound here is good,though many of the songs are in Mono.Highly recommended nonetheless."
3,A little uneven !,"A somewhat uneven 1967 release of a collection of Beatles singles. Sound quality is a bit muddled but for completists, it's a fairly priced compilation."
3,"good album, great bonus","This is the first SFA album i ever bought, and it pretty much ruled my summer. The entire album is entertaining, but Sidewalk Surfer Girl is my favorite. A lot of the songs are just silly, but backed by very interesting electronic music. I give the album 3 stars. The bonus disc is another story, though. The best songs, Tradewinds, Edam, All the Sh*t U do, are there. If these songs had replaced some of the weaker tracks on the album, i'd have a hard time not giving it a 5-star-classic status. With all the good tracks broken up, though, the experience is somewhat less enjoyable. But just like their amazing follow up, Phantom Power, only The Flaming Lips can out-do this kind of cool electronic pop."
2,Directionless,"Rings Around the World is an album without a style. Every time SFA start to get a cohesive song together, it's torn apart by an over-reliance on synth-driven technology. The few songs that are coherent are suspiciously familiar. Example: Juxtaposed With U is simply a remake of Ebony And Ivory.Are SFA forever to remain a quirky directionless band? Until they get their style together, probably.[DW]"
3,Too much of a mediocre thing,"Talk about over-produced. The songs are so lacking in life and originality that the producers must have felt the need to make up for it all by filling every available space with as many computerized instruments as possible, layering one over the other, over another until you're bombarded with a wall of bland noise. Most songs on the CD sound alike, and sound just like a myriad of other bands. The most interesting and fresh elements are instrumental segues between songs, where you hear the brilliance and innovation that is entirely lacking in the songwriting. It's not a bad album, and I may pop it in for a listen once a year, but I really wish I hadn't spent the money."
1,"You win some, you lose some","Alot of people write all these glowing reviews and claim the latest and greatest post prog genre splitting-whatever.... this aint it. Way out there and boring. Music never takes off. I bought it on a whim, shoulda listned to more samples. Wasted money that coulda gone to other habits..."
2,"Uh Oh, Time for a Reality Check","Now that this CD is collecting dust in my collection after buying it on import a while back, it's time to pull back the bit on its praise and the Beach Boys/Beatles comparisons. This group, in fact, attempts to merge the late 60s/early 70s experimental sounds of Brian Wilson with the psychedlic era Pink Floyd/Syd Barrett. And they fail. The songs are too disjointed and the production is too cluttered. Bit of navel-gazing at work too; some songs are staggering in their length. Videos of this band don't do them any favors, either, as they lack onstage in charisma, style, or visual appeal. But it's the music that matters, you can say, and after trying very hard to see the substance in this band, I gave up. The critics are wrong. A good dose of David Gedge and the Wedding Present helped purge the bad vibes I got from SFA."
4,A fine step,"Rings Around the World is the worst release by Welsh britpoppers Super Furry Animals, but it still warrants a 9/10. This says a lot about the magic of this group. ""Alternate Route to Vulcan Street"" and ""Shoot Doris Day"" are gorgeously wistful ballads, while tracks like ""Sidewalk Serfer Girl"" and ""(Drawing) Rings Around the World"" encapsulate the fun, rocking atmosphere which characterizes so much of this band's work. The album is slightly let down by some dreary instrumentals and the frankly rubbish ""Presidential Suite,"" but the rest of it more than makes up. This may not be the best place to start with Super Furry Animals, but it's certainly a great place to go."
3,Gear Wrench Ratcheting Screwdriver Handle,"I bought the handle to replace one that broke. When it works, it's fine. Hope this one lasts longer than the other one I bought."
1,No Backlit display on this model,"Despite what the description says, the display on this model is not backlit. At least not the one I received. Even the GE product spec sheet from their own web site says backlit, but it is not. No one else commented on this, so not sure if I have a defective item or not, but I specifically bought it for the backlit display, so it's going back. I see that another GE model, 29369GE1, is backlit according to some reviewers, so I'm going to give that one a try. Rated a one for bum product info."
2,Corded Telephone Not the Best,I was unhappy with just about everything with this phone. It did not last long and did not work well at all. I had to replace it within a year. I got the Panasonic Model Number KX-TS600B Which I love and is giving me lots of years of good service with all the features I do need and like.
4,good phone for the money,"The things I like are the speaker part hands free I have it on my computer desk so I can be talking to some one while typing,and no power cord use's 4 aa batteries.things I don't like are not enough stored numbers and no back lite on caller ID 'but is easy to read other wise.Good phone fo the money would buy again."
1,Whacky-- potential for invasion of privacy,"I hooked this thing up, minutes later while at my desk i see the ""speaker"" light illuminate. I know i put the ringer on ""hi"". After staring puzzled, I said ""HELLO??"" to hear my mother's voice reply!?!?!?! If I hadn't been at my desk and seen the light, a caller would have heard me and/or my family members though we NEVER ACTUALLY ANSWERED OR EVEN TOUCHED THE PHONE!!!. How can this be?? And then it would not disconnect. I could not end the call and my line eventually went dead after the series of ""if you'd like to make a call..."" going to the very loud ""beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep..."". I finally had to pull the plug on this one!!I did not read the directions, but I am certain this product is faulty and created much frustration. Thought it was a bit pricey for bottom of the line speakerphone w/ caller id AND didn't happen to notice the box tell me that i'd need 4 ""AA"" batteries for the caller i.d. (though I may have just overlooked that in the store)"
4,SR-71 Remake,"Three songs from this album were originally released by the band SR-71, a largely forgotten band that seems to get no recognition for the great work they do, allowing other bands to gain the rewards, just like what happened with the hit song ""1985"" (also originally released by SR-71).The original versions of these songs (as released by SR-71) are far superior to what's featured on this disc. It's too bad two of those, ""Blue Light Special Life"" and ""Here We Go Again"" are only available as a Japanese import. ""She Was Dead"" is the other song on this disc originally released by SR-71.I gave this CD a four star rating soley because I believe those three songs are absolutely superb, but if they were the original versions, this CD would have gotten a five star rating from me."
5,They are an awesome band!,"I saw JParis back in May for Bamboozle & thought they sounded amazing. I have been looking in stores since & haven't been able to find the CD. Amazon was my last hope, & there it was. & just as I expected from what they performed, the CD is great as well."
5,boston s65,I had to redo this review I originally had my impedance reversed.now it sounds really good has great mid bass and super clean highs.great sound for the money.buy it.
2,"Wow , haha, that was BAD","This IS a truly awful film . I'm a completist and a big Rutger Hauer fan , so i sat threw this unitentionally comical picture so that i could warn you AND i like bad film . Not THIS bad though . The only thing more wooden than the laughable script and dialogue is the terrible ""take the paycheck and sprint"" gaggle of performances on display . Hauer's character's precocious daughter gets to say a LOT of absurd adult speak while the crime fighters are depicted as uniformly thick nitwits . It's one of those ""seems like a crumby made for television"" bad films in which the music doesn't match what's going on onscreen . In which the actors have only forced chemistry and their words have NO natural rhythm(s) . My Mick Martin and Marsha Porter authored Dvd & Video Guide cica 2005 serves me well here . It shows the image of a Turkey . The text is downhill from there ."
4,male bonding,"great as a project to be shared. husband and grandsons, 4 and 6,bonded greatly during the project"
1,Price is Ridiculous,"They are charging $1.80 for each page. In the original binder they charged $0.57 a page, PLUS you got a binder.It doesn't take a math wizard to figure out that these extra pages are WAY overpriced.I love the Case Logic binders, and have 5 of them. I just wish extra pages were priced reasonably..."
4,DVD Refill Pages,"They are really nice, however, they are not what I expected. I was wanting the ones with 4 holders on each side and these only have them on one side."
5,Dvd refill with cover,"These are great, I've have the system with binder year sago. But they should sell thses in larger quantities. Getting only 5 pages for 10 full size DVD isn't enough.Shipping was very slow"
1,What a RIPOFF!,"Ok - I only get 5 pages for $11.99. My DVB80 came with 20 pages to start with - and the album for $29.99. So - if I wanted 20 pages to use in my many albums - then it would cost me $47.96 (4 x $11.99 refill cost)!!!!I could purchase 2 NEW DVB80 albums for $59.98, get 40 refill pages and get 2 binders to use for other purposes!!!Does Case Logic think it's customers are idiots???"
3,Hit And Miss,"jestofunk's release from a few years back, love in a black dimension, was a hit and miss affair. it was a mixture of instrumental jazz-funk jams and housey vocal numbers. some were great, others weren't. this remix collection is pretty much the same bag. some of the songs don't sound all that different than the originals and others are repetitious, but there are a few tracks that can't be ignored. soul chemistry's mix of ""can we live"" is a soulful r&b number that is powered by ce ce rodgers vocals and a trance-backdrop that would make the masters of trance proud. the real killer on this cd though is the wild magnolia's mix of ""say it again"". the vocalist sounds huge and sings like he's sweating the pounds off. plus, his vocals are potted over a funky as hell guitar riff and a groove that you won't want to stop."
4,Excellent freshman CD,"Najee's Theme is one of Najee's best collections. This album has smooth and crisp--sounds of the perfect saxaphone. This CD laid the ground work for great music from Najee. My favorite songs are: ""What you do to me,"" ""Najee's Theme"" and ""Mysterious."" Najee nearly performed this whole album at a concert in 1986 (when it was Najee's only album) This performance was the motivation for my CD purchase."
1,wrong book,This was listed as a paper back version of a completely different book. So I purchased the wrong book. It was completely useless to me.
1,Bike Gear Universal brake set,was mounted properly and broke off at the handle bars in 6 days...five of those days were rainy so what Im saying they broke the first day..
1,Junk,"Ive had three of these turkeys die on me in less than a year, and each of them had been used for no more than 10 3-day gigs. The pattern is always the same: The channels stop responding one-by-one until finally all four are dead. I'll be looking elsewhere for replacements."
4,Pocket optical level,"I am a civil engineer and have taught surveying at a local college. In the past 35 years, I have used very expensive hand levels at school and work. This one is not as professional looking, but does just as good of a job. Can't beat the price. Brought more for the other engineers in the office for site surveys."
4,Worked just like it was supposed to,Worked like it was supposed to. Everything was as expected. Quality appears to exceed the price. I have used this type of eye level in the past and this one appeared to work as well as more expensive models.
4,Handheld site level,"This level works fine. Just what I thought it would be. The optics could be better, but for this price, it would be hard to beat. The same type level 20 years ago was much more expensive."
4,Looking for a Job - Read this First,Here's a behind the scene scoop on how hiring managers and professionals scope you out. Great book but very long winded.
4,Land that next job,This book was recommended by a professional recruiter. Overall the book was informative across a wide array of topics that should help in the interviewing process. 80% common sense for the logical professional.
3,Good but a bit outdated,"I read the original release of this book in the mid 1990s and was amazed at what I saw as breakthrough thinking and information that only could come from a true insider. The most recent edition has much of that original content - along with updates for the world of internet job searches -it just feels like it was written around 2000 with little fresh insight on today's job search world or social media. And the website that the book sends you too - RiteSite - is clunky and doesn't appear to have been updated in years. Got turned off by Lucht's overemphasis on still using snail mail to send resumes. Who views hard copy mail as critical any longer? The section on interviewing and negotiation worth what I paid, however."
3,Add this to your professional bookshelf,A friend suggested I read this book when I was making a re-entry into corporate accounting after being a stay-at-home mom for nearly 2 decades. I found the advice and information extremely helpful in landing a position that I love.Marie Estorgeauthor of STORKBITES: A MEMOIRand CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEENStorkbites: A Memoir
5,Worth its weight in gold.,"Mr. Lucht leaves no doubt that he is at the forefront of career consulting. Not only does this book provide an overview of the issues, but it goes into step-by-step procedural detail on how to supercharge your job search.An excellent addition is the companion workbook. The combination have helped me update my approach to job-seeking in dramatic fashion.The newly release edition keeps all of the useful techniques of earlier addition, and is also full of excellent references to current resources and the way to use them."
1,"More like ""An Idiots Guide to 2001 Job Search for Fools""","First written in 1993 and now updated in 2001 to include ""Internet coverage / tools""; if you are interested in outdated information provided in long form and returning low ROI--then this book is for you. In reading the book and rereading the reviews here one might conclude that the positive reviews were self-generated or paid for.As an executive headhunter/recruiter myself, I suggest you save yourself from an excruciatingly painful 581 page read and pass on this one. Certainly not written for an executive-level audience; poorly written and even more poorly edited (seemingly unedited). If you still feel otherwise compelled buy one, consider one the many used editions currently available through Amazon; in this case the used book reseller is providing much higher value and greater service than the writer has."
2,Good book for reference;But not great,I purchased this book and found that a lot of the information on how to search and prepare to make a job change was somewhat outdated. I had the version that was published a few years back. Many of the concepts are the same. Lot's of fluff though.
2,This book is out of date for today's job market,"After you read pages 1-61, you can pretty much close the book. Written in a recruiter-centric manner by a former recruiter, this book is way out of date in most of its material. Some of the networking comments are good, but that is about it. Read Don't Send a Resume instead. I am a career coach who has read all of the popular literature and this is not very good. Much erroneous information...."
2,Summary with no meat,"The book is simply a summary outline of the material for the CFP test, which can easily be obtained on the Board's website. Without sufficient detail, I can not imagine how it could be helpful.Anthony"
4,Word to the Wise,"I found the book to be extremely helpful, but did not use it as a sole source. The book kept most of the topics simple and clear. I used it as a portable way to review material. ALWAYS, check the copyright on books like this because so much information is year specific. I passed!!"
1,Overly brief,"This book is too brief to be helpful. It is mainly an outline, with not much more detail than the CFP exam topics list. It doesn't serve as a very helpful reference resource because the Table of Contents is too simplistic, and has a very minimal index."
4,Wrong Picture,They show the Halo collector card and say its a Halo3 card but it is a normal 13 month 360 Live card. I complained and they would have refunded the money if I returned it. It's still a good deal just don't expect to get the collectors card.
3,product great but my credit card number was stolen when I ordered the product,"The product itself was wonderful. After I made the purchase my credit card company called me to tell me there was a lot of strange activity on my card. Yes it was stolen. It took me a while to clear this situation up. I love the product but will never order it again, I dont know if it was the fault of amazon or the company who sold the product."
1,Overpriced and Overvalued,"You pay [too much] for a How-to Book. No explantions/examples about object-oriented programming (as UML defines it). The idea is good: you start with an example and refine it on the way. But consuming half a page to show me the actions for a specific task underestimates my I.Q. level. If you want a book that explains briefly the menus of Rational Rose it's a right choise. If you want a book that explains how to develop programs using UML, search elsewhere."
4,Nice introduction to rational rose (if you know UML),"A very nice short introduction to the Rational Rose tool, pleasant to read, good to jump start using Rose. It helps if you already have some prior UML knowledge, because the book is more focusing on using the Rose in RUP, not UML.If you just want to quickly learn UML, you may want to consider UML Distilled by Martin Fowler .Lacking of introduction to foreward/reverse engineering in Java/J2EE is a small pitfall, otherwise it deserves 5 stars."
4,"Good Introduction to Rose, but Overpriced","This book gives a worked example to using Rational Rose. It covers basics of UML, but not in detail. Overall, you should be able to appreciate the advantages of Visual modelling once you read this book. I would say this book is ideal for a person who has just learnt UML and OOAD concepts and is on the lookout for full fledged example of using those concepts. For just that, the book is over priced."
3,Bird-watcher's manual,So you can distinguish a cardinal from a chicken? Can you fly?Terry describes the basic diagrams and syntax of UML with a very simple Course Enrolment example that serves to show what things look like. Not much more here.
1,I use it as a wrist rest next to my mouse,"Rational software ships this book free when you buy Rational Rose. Even then it is overpriced. If you don't know UML, this book may lead you astray. The author tells you how to draw things with Rational Rose, but not why you might want to draw them. Without a doubt, the worst UML book I've ever encountered. I feel sorry for the author; it seems that she (?) was probably tasked by Rational to write a user's manual for Rational rose, and someone at Rational thought they could make some more money by publishing it as a separate book. Unfortunately, it's insufficiently thorough to be a worthwhile user's manual."
2,Not very useful,"This is quite nicely structured and descriptive, but it offered nothing new, at least to me. You'll better go with the (original) UML user manual and the information offered by Rational on Rose. It further touches only a few aspects of Rose."
1,Overpriced and almost meet the objective,"I am senior software engineer, I picked up this book neither to learn UML nor to design, but to learn rational rose.If you want to learn design I don't recommend this book.If you want to learn UML notation I don't recommend this book. For example it doesn't address a very important topic that is tasks communication: - Asynchronous message communication - Synchronous message communication with or without replayIf you want to learn rational rose, this book gives you a start but very much overpriced (Double the real value). I thought learning the tools from a book I would learn it in detail, but I was wrong, I could've picked up a few a pages tutorial, and it would do the job, Frankly I believe the price is a robbery, you taking this a device from a person never cared a bout any book price."
4,Rational Rose in a Hurry,"I found myself in a bind. I had Rational training scheduled three months out, but we had project deadlines that were only 4 weeks away. I knew some UML, but I had never worked with the tool before. Luckily, I found this book. It gives very detailed instructions for creating the various UML artifacts that Rose can generate. A continuing example runs throughout the book so you get to see how all the various elements can be linked together to help you organize your analysis and design. If your goal is to learn how to use Rose - and do it quickly - this book is for you."
1,useless,complete waste of money. It's more of a Rational Rose for dummies book than anything else. Dont waste your money
3,A book without sparkles,"A good book has a lot of sparkles, which represents the author's deep understanding on a concept and his unique way to depict it. But I didn't see many sparkles in this book.A good book introducing a car should say: ""A car has four wheels so that it can run on the road. To guide the direction of the wheels, we have a steering wheel. To provide power to roll the wheels, we have the engine. To connect the engine with the wheels, we have transmission system"".The way this book uses is: ""A car has wheels. It has steering wheels. It has an engine. It has transmission. It has water tank. It has seats. It has doors. ....""."
5,BeBe & CeCe Winans - The Holy Ghost,"If you have the Holy Ghost, This CD we make your spirit bubble. Especially tracks: Still in Love with you, Love said not so and change your nature. The message is clear, pray and shout daily. Jesus is real and so is this CD."
2,Gruesome is right. Ick.,"Three warty, insatiable brothers, so obnoxious they ate their mother when she failed to feed them enough, go on a rampage to eat everything in sight. The pictures do not spare the reader their unappetizing quest, even showing one brother on the back of a fleeing pig (none too handsome itself) taking a bite out of its shoulder. We later see the same pig in the background, minus the bite and with a knife stuck through its side. The text and pictures tell us also that the brothers are ""worshipped in hell"". The end is anti-climactic, and all three brothers are devoured (thankfully unseen) by something ""bigger, hungrier, and harrier"". The cover showes one G. B. biting the head off a fish, blood and guts and all, and another about ready to devour the third. The rhyme is occasionally forced, and the foreign diction of the authors is occasionally apparent (""wellies""). The illustrations have an atractive, almost gothic quality, but this cannot be a book for kids."
1,Not age appropriate,"The Brothers Gruesome, is extactly that gruesome and overtly so. Should this book be read by youngsters it would surely induce nightmares or questions most adults are not ready to answer. The illustrations are indeed well done. Although the storyline is rhythmical it lacks an interesting plot. I do not recommend this book for children between the ages of 4-8. This is more well suited for adults."
2,Very disappointing!,"There are several reasons why I do not recommend this printer:1. Lack of Customer Support. Sony is notorious for bad support. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried getting support via email, chat and phone and did not get any help.2. Picture Quality. While the pictures are sharp, the colors are really off. When I have tried printing several pictures, they come out with a yellow tint. These same pictures were sent to an online printer and came back okay.3. LCD Screen. Even though Sony makes the screen really easy to use, it does not always reflect the exact way a picture comes out. I found myself wasting a lot of paper because the picture on the screen looked good but then printed out too yellow, etc.4. Documentation. The documentation they include with the printer is very poor.I received this printer for Christmas and I am definitely thinking about bringing it back. It is definitely not the quality I expected from Sony."

2,Clumsy and annoying,"(...) This case looks good, but functionally it's awkward to use. I have one of these and 2 of the CdProjects 40-DVD binder -- by far the best. It has a better finish and the pages allow you to see the actual DVD, rather than hiding it under a flap. And the retail price of the CdProjects binder is (good)."
3,"Great for portability, but....","If you're on the go a lot like me and like to take your entertainment with you, then the DVA40 is an excellent way to do just that. The problems arise, however, when you you begin to peruse your collection, and discover that the flaps tend to stay open and (a) your [less costly] DVDs fall out, and (b) it begins to create folds in the covers that are near impossible to get out. I highly urge case logic to develop a cover that seals (snaps, perhaps?) so that an otherwise fine product is not marred by a highly annoying design flaw."
3,Good design but damages furniture,"Good looking, good design in terms of storage. Durable. BUT...the phoney leather-like material can stick to wood furniture and damage wood finishes. BEWARE. A material like Cordura would have been a better choice."
4,Storing DVD's in a small space,"I have found this product to be more than satisfactory. I have no space for the towers, shelves or other DVD storage means. Other reviewers have rated this lower because of the flaps staying open. It's true that you do have to be careful when handling the DVD's but I wouldn't want to be anything else. I have trimmed the covers so they fit in the sleeves. I get linear notes and the backs in the sleeves too. I keep a list of what movies are in each book and keep the movies alphabetically sorted. I also have a master list telling me what movie is in what book since I am now filling my second book. I've stored CD's in similar Case Logic books for years with no problem. Have not experienced any scratching from the pockets. Very neat, organized way to store movies."
2,Not So Hot After All,"I use the Case Logic Koskin binders for all my CDs. Love 'em. However, when I naturally purchased this for my DVDs, I was disappointed. Problem 1: The DVD books slide out of their sleeves as you flip the pages; Problem 2: The flaps that enclose the DVD for protection flap open as you turn the pages. So when you're done looking through your DVDs (or PS2 games) the majority of the flaps are open and some of the books have begun to slide out. A pain. I'm going to replace it with a smaller CD Koskin binder for my DVDs since it's not often that I look back at the DVD book for reference. Again, great concept, just doesn't work as well as you'd hope."
1,Throwing Money Down the Drain,"This case is worthless. As mentioned above in other reviews, the DVDs fly out of this thing as you flip through the pages, and the flaps that I guess are supposed to protect the DVDs make zippering the case up a pain in the neck. I actually just got through cutting the flaps out. Suggestion: put several folded pieces of paper behind the DVD booklet in the case the keep the DVDs from sliding out, its a good way to remedy the failures of the so called experts that designed this thing."
1,This book is too simple,This book is too simple. but is a good primer for beginners. However there are some other good books available which cover the introductions better.
1,This is the book my therapist is helping me to repress,"This might be agood book if you know exactly know what you are doing. Trying to do energy exercises week after week without any control from a teacher is just proposterous, and will get you into a mental institution. Some exercises are very advanced and might cause disfunction in your mental state and your sex life. So, i advise you to be careful."
1,Very terrible!,"I am from Middle East and I say now that this book was total horrible. At first I thought it might be because my English is my second language, but after many careful reads I realize that this book was written by someone head in the sick! I have teacher over here and he look at it and he laughs this man just trying to make money and teach people all wrong about magic! What have to do with spirituality. None!"
2,"Pretty pictures, but nothing is new in this end of town!","While Mr. Yudelove must be commended for his wonderful illustrations, this work is simplistic re-hash of Taoist texts authored by Mantak Chia. After shelling out some duckets for his first book, ""The Tao and The Tree of Life"" sight unseen and being considerably dissapointed, I am glad I returned to my policy of perusing potential purchases as my local dealer."
2,"It's okay, but lacks real content -","It's okay, but lacks real content I am a REAL Chinese, I can tell that Eric is not. His book is very superficial and many points have been taken/copied or a similar to many other books and information available. Nothing new has been presented except for a change of names and illustrations. However if you are a Westerner who likes to collect books for the sake of collection or want to see a summarization of more authentic books and deeper information then this would be the book for you. It makes a good ""coffee table"" reading for those with no time. In this case, the price outlines the quality of the book. You pay for what you get. There are many other books available which have higher quality and content. When looking at a taoist book you must look at the author of the book and his/her credentials. As a general tip. In searching for a traditional chinese taoist book find a taoist."
5,Red Hot and Rockin',"The lyrics may be trashy but the fretboards burn from start to finish on this piledriving CD.Alligator Alley is the stand out track with Kevin Russell, Johnny Nitro and Tommy Castro all taking their turns to rip it up !Buy this immediately,you won't be disappointed."
3,Not bad but a tad flimsy for the price,Still got that boogie going on with the slightest tap when I have my G11 mounted on it. It is what it is though you feel me?
4,Buen cabezal,"¡Hola!Compré este cabezal para usarlo con el trípode Cullmann Video Magic, el cuál venía con un cabezal de video en vez de este que es para fotografía. Si bien no es un cabezal profesional, he descubierto que el mismo tiene una calidad más que aceptable y totalmente acorde con la del trípode (que considero muy bueno y portatil). Soporta perfectamente mi Canon 7D + Flash 580ex II con lentes 10-22, 17-55 y 70-300.Saludos!Julián."
4,it's exactly what you would expect,"It's not rocket science. They're star stickers. They stick to things, and are shaped like stars. They're also real shiny."
1,Very Disappointing,Tis true - the murderer is obvious very early; the heroine is not heroic at all and the characters were all unlikeable - except her mother of whom we saw too little. There was no there there.
1,Get this Author An Editor!,"This book sounded absolutely adorable with its murder occurring in the beauty shop. Some days when our hair doesn't come out looking so hot, I'm sure murder is on the mind of some of the patrons. Marla (the principal character) sounded like someone we'd want to know. I know South Florida as my folks have lived there for quite some time. All the elements of a book I should like were in place.Let's start with the writing. The author describes a lot of stuff that doesn't move along the action at all. She hints at back stories for some of the characters but, doesn't give us the details then, plops them in at inappropriate spots. Why not tell us about the girls at the salon? The mystery is weak, too. It doesn't take much to figure this one out at all. Let's hope that Ms. Cohen either improves her writing skills or gets a better editor, please."
2,Blah,"I saw this mystery in the store and thought: ""hey, this looks good"". I thought it would be fun and interesting - neither which turned out to be true. The story was dark and depressing and the mystery annoying and convulted. Marla must be the stupidest so-called sleuth in the history of dumb sleuths if she didn't figure out the killer until the end. The clues were so obvious it was painful to watch her stumble around. I had to force myself to complete it.I had to feel sorry for Marla at one point where the detective ripped her to shreds for her past - I would have slapped him and hard! Too bad she forgave him when he smiled at her.Bogus! 2 stars is being too fair."
1,Permed to Death,"I found this book very disappointing. The murderer was obvious very early on, the heroine just chose to ignore the very blatant clues. The cover art is adorable, but the book has no substance."
4,Potential with proffesionalism.,"I really enjoyed this book- it was really intriguing. Even though I felt like I knew who the murderer was pretty early on- it made the book even more irresistable to see if I was right. So saying, I must also say the book was a little too closely centered on sex. Romance peppered in is great, but I do hope that the future books in this series will have less explicit parts about sex. Other than this- I loved the book. I look forward to reading more. Oh yeah- I loved Detective Vail. I hope he continues to play a big part in this series, and also that we'll hear from his daughter. I hope to see new books in this series very soon."
3,Good First in Series,"Main character, Marla Shore - hair salon owner - has one of her customers drop dead after drinking a cup of coffee she served her. This spurs Marla on to find the real killer. Though the book was well written and good, the title and cover may mislead readers into thinking the story is full of laughs, and it's not. If there were any attempts at humor, I missed them. Marla is not a real interesting character. She seems to just exist, and there is nothing to really like or dislike about her. However, the author brings in other characters that have more of a personality (perhaps too many in this story). Hopefully we will get to know Marla better in the second book."
3,Early Stevie Winwood,"This CD does contain the songs that made the Spencer Davis Group popular so you won't be dissapointed in the selections. If you are a collector of Stevie Winwood's works, this album is a must have. The problem is that the recording quality is so poor that it sounds like a mistuned AM radio. If you must have these songs or you wish to have a collection of Stevie Winwood's early stuff, buy it but be prepared for very low fidelity."
3,Wildflowers of North America in full color,Book is very dated. Information can and should be updated. Pictures are not the best quality.
4,Excellent Documentary of Their Rise to Gold,"Great clips from competitions, and some of them show complete programs. Saves fans of T & D a lot of money on competition videos!"
2,Generic tv movie,I rented this because of Diane Lane. I have to admit I didn't think it would be too good and I got what I excepted.Diane Lane plays a naive Texas girl who wins a national beauty contest. She realizes that it isn't all it's cracked up. She has to leave behind her loved ones and live up to the phony image. It doesn't take her long before she's disillusioned. It's like an after school special minus the cheese. Cloris Leachman is her mentor and she does her usual eccentric character well.Diane is pretty here and does the best job she can with a weak cliche script. There is one serious scene with a blue eyeliner that was unintentionally hilarious. For an example of a young Lane the charming A Little Romance is a better recommendation.
5,Diane Lane Rules!!!,"The beautiful,talented Diane Lane rules in one of her earlier films.It's a must see!!!!"
2,Worked great for a year!,I was very impressed by how quickly the mosquito trap filled up. The tape caught more horse flys than mosquitos which was nice. The 2nd year it started up nicely. After a few day I went to empty the trap but the trap was empty and the machine was off. It started right up again. I checked it 30 min later and it was off. I finally determined that it would shut off after 5-10 minutes. It is now past the warrenty date and I'm in search of a better and cost effective method of killing the litter critters.
2,Only worked for 1 season,I purchased the Skeeter Vac 2704 last March 08. It worked pretty well the first summer (though you should put it in the shade for best results). Now this summer I noticed the fan was not working. I took it apart to clean and still no fan. I am not sure if I will purchase a new fan or a different product. A little disappointed. It should have lasted at least 3 - 5 years minimum for the price.
1,"Save your money buy a fly swat, it'll work better","I had this thing (the skeeter vac model CPSV3100 for 1 acre), $315.00 I plunked down for it and the tac-traps(which by the way caught a lot a bugs, just none of them were mosquitos). I put it in a spot in my back yard where I got bit the most often and sat right beside it with mosquitos eating me alive. I left the piece of junk in that very spot for a week and it caught 3 mosquitos, hardly worth the effort. Just while I was dismantling it alone I got bit more times than I can count, so believe me mosquitos were there in abundance. My advice is to buy some more citronela candles, they work better. I don't know how they get good reviews for this, they must be hiring them, if it don't catch mosquitos by accident in my back yard it is a peice of junk in my opinion. I sent it back to Amazon the next day.Bob Wright440-396-8037"
1,Died after one year,I bought this model last year and it worked great. This year it would not start. The good thing is Blue Rhino honored the warrantee even though it expired a couple of weeks before that. They said that this model SV-27 had a flaw in the design of the combustion chamber which made it more likely to fail. They said the newer models (like SV3000 and SV5000) have a better design. They did send me a replacement engine (basically the entire top) which is one of the newer models. I am pleased with the support I got from them but if I was buying a new one I would not get a SV27. I would look for one of the new models.
2,"Quality construction, bu just not sure it really works","We live in virginia and have a bad problem. Maybe not as bad as some of the other writers who live in swamps. Bad nonetheless to the point of getting 5 bites in an hour.The unit is definately high quality. The ignitor always works. About the only mechanical problem we had was when a rodent ate through the gas line.My wife swears that the unit works, but I rarely, if ever, saw a mosquito in the basket. I attribute the decrease more to the drought we experienced.After going through five propane refills and cleaning out at most 100 mosquitos I figured that going for a sixth is just wrong for the environment. I'll try again next season, but will look for alternatives."
4,Amazing equipment,"This is my second SkeeterVac. The first one quit after 3 years and I decided to replace it with this one. We live in Coastal Southern Georgia, and needless to say we are easy prey for mosquitoes, gnats and other unpleasant bugs.This machine will catch about 1000 bugs per day in our garden. So far it's been so successful that each tactrap won't last more than 1 to 2 weeks, and we have to replace it (it's a rather expensive spare part). It did not eliminate all bugs but I have to say it's a big improvement and we can use our deck again."
3,Somewhat useful only,"I had no trouble fitting this to my Telrad finder. I find that the glass on my Telrad is the first part of my equipment to get dew on it at night. This shield helps stop dew forming on the glass - as long as I remember (or can be bothered) to tip it into place after each time I use the finder! A small disadvantage is that it obscures the sight through the ""other"" eye, which normally would look above the finder (as the other is looking through it) and help you find the object. This shield helps but is not 100% effective, so I installed a Telrad dew heater instead, which was much better at keeping dew off."
2,Duets,This isn't one of my favorite CD's by Kenny Rogers. I don't listen to it very often as I don't care for most of the selections.
5,I can't say enough good things about this book,"It is Japanese through and through.After reading Musashi I realized how pale Shogun is.This book is worth twice the price. The characters are true, not bits from central casting. The minutia about daily life in Edo Japan was priceless."
4,A very good translation of the classic tale,"This is well written translation of the classic tale of Musashi. I think any review needs to touch on both the translation and the story itself. As a translation, this one is very smooth, without some of the odd syntax of others. The story itself is well known in its overall theme (no spoilers here!). Reading the book will also introduce you to a lot of subplots. A few of the characters are a little one dimensional, but not to the real detriment of the story. One thing to keep in mind in your reading -- because the story jumps around a little and has a lot of characters, if you put it down for a bit and then come back, you are apt to forget who is who (beyond Musashi and a few other main characters.). So it's a better read when you have an hour or more, instead of just a few minutes here and there."
5,words can not express how much I like this book.,"this book is simply superb. I read this book 2 years ago and I was enchanted by the characters and amazed at the authors superb writing style. This book gave me faith in humanity, it made me see how much potensial lies with in each of us. It inspired me to become a better human being and to waste not even a moment of my precious life. This book kept me reading for hours on end. I highly recomend this book to people with an open mind. It may change your life!"
5,"Excellent - combines romance, Zen, philosphy, great battles","I think this book apart from being totally entertaining, can teach the average person about life, it also shows a great insight into what life was like in japan during those days."
5,Great Book,"I watched the film, Samurai Trilogy Part 1, which is based on this book. I decided to read the book before I watched the other two parts of the trilogy.When I got the book I was intimidated by it. It is a thick book made with think paper and small type. In other words, there is a *lot* to read. There are a large number of characters, and I had a little trouble at first remembering which name was which. There are some good action scenes, but if you want non-stop action then you should pick something else. This is mostly the story of a man gaining control over himself and seeking inner perfection."
4,Good Story about Musashi,"Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa is a great introduction to Miyamoto Musashi as well as an entertaining fictional account of the first 30 years of his life. If you are looking for an entertaining story based on the life of Miyamoto Musashi, this is the book. If you are looking for an account of the principles and practices of Miyamoto Musashi, this is not for you.Musashi is a bit of a folk legend in Japan, along the same lines as Robin Hood or Davy Crockett; knowing this going into the book will give the reader an idea of the historical context. This book is a work of fiction. The book is loosly based on the facts of Miyamoto Musashi's life, but a biography it is not.At almost 1000 pages of dense text, the book can seem overwhelming, but it is actually a quick read. The story progresses nicely and the characters are all well developed.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Miyamoto Mushahi, Japanese History, or just looking for a good adventure story."
3,Starr Time!,"Great music but the running length of this CD is very short, even deficient by vinyl standards."
5,Great!,"I just got this CD and it will be in my CD player for a long time! While I had heard Photograph on the radio over the years, I had never really listened to the words properly, what a lovely song. It made me cry.The whole CD is a joy and I know it is one I will listen to over and over!"
3,It's a Blast!,"I docked this a star for the cd being so short. Back when this was released on vinyl, 10 or 11 songs was fine, but on CD it seems skimpy. Anyway, if you remember Ringo's big hits of the early 70's, they're pretty much all here, and they all sound great. Maybe a more complete retrospective will be released someday, but for now, if you need to hear ""The No No Song,"" or ""It Don't Come Easy,"" go ahead and pick this up."
4,Excellent value in a good package,I have three CR30's stacked and I wish I had purchased more because it is difficult to find them now.They are very useful and simple to setup.
5,As good as any I've tried.,"I have a hard time finding this size envelop locally, so I randomly ordered these off of Amazon. Fortunately these have work perfectly. The clasp is solid, the glue hasn't flaked off or poisoned me, and the envelopes do not fall apart in transit. What more could you ask out of a humble envelop? The price is right, too."
2,pretty lace but hold just isnt there,The lace body shaper is pretty but holds absolutley nothing in it actually made me look worse in my clothes and added extra material I did not need if you are large on top this has alot of padding I did not need and made me flop out ... FYI I also ordered a mirclesuit and that worked great it took me down a whole size!!!!
4,First-class book of airport industry,"A very good book,most 'freindly' and understandabale, offers wide spectrum of airport's infrastructure as well as its economic aspects. Recommanded forb thse intersted in aaition in general and airport planning in particular.Hiilel Avihai"
4,you may like this,"It seems like it is an ok toy, i will admitt i do not have it so i am sorry if this meens nothing to anyone. but i have bought alot of stuff from them and was happy. just rember when you bye it, it may break easaly and i am sure it will not hert your eyes cuzz that would be way to much as a law suit. but if you are not in public and you are hidding and dont wont to make nosies this is good but if you dont care about quietness then you may not like the fact that you everyone nows you are wering a weird norisable this rember a good spy always keeps him or her self unotised and calm one of these this is only good for speilal opperations"
2,Not enough enformation!,"There was not enough information about the item. If i knew what an eye link comunicator was i might buy it. It sounds fun! but seeing as i dont know waht it does or what it is i will not buy.Thank you,Cori"
2,Headpiece too tight for 11 year old,"My son received this toy when he was around 11. I saw him play with it once or twice with his friends. The kids have to type in messages, which may get them to try to spell words correctly. My son tells me it is too tight on his head."
5,The Most Coolest Spy Gear Ever !!!!!!!!!,"Comment: The Eye Link Comm. are cool.Edu.: Practice TypingDurabilty: Okay, (DON'T TRY TO DROP FROM 10 FT HIGH THOUGH)Overall: AMAZING!"
3,For little kids.,"I didnot know they were 90 feet range til I got them who wants 90 feet range spy toy? I hate the way they go on your head it hurts, it looks stupid, and it should go at least 3 miles so they can go around the neighborhood instead of to the end of a short road."
3,"Eyes hurt, head hurts big let down",I really thought that this would be great. I heard some bad and some good but decided it sounded like it good be educational and fun so why not. Biggest waste of money... He wants to use it so badly but headset is too tight and the writing isn't easy to read.
3,liked it at first,"I got this toy last christmas. I liked it at first, but then it got boring. It hurts your eyes after awhile. The bad thing about this toy is that it started not to work. There is a little red screen that has the words that your partner sends to you. After awhile the words on the red screen started to fade. I tried putting new batteries in, but that didn't work. I do not think this is a great toy to buy."
4,Worth It,"This toy is a lot of fun. But it doesn't transmit at 200 feet, as it is supposed to. The head piece is a bit too tight(...) . As a result, it can be difficult to see the screen because you can't adjust the angle fully. Even so, my 8 year old sister and I love playing with it. We're glad we bought it."
3,Dont use hade set inclued,The toy is o.k. but it dose not fit. I reccomented it but you should use any other haed set other then what it comes with! For smaller haeds it is ok but the bigger you are the easyer it gets to brake so do not use the had set inclued
2,Defective Product,"I always get this type of paper to print my pictures from my Sony Cybershot Digital Camera. But this time when I tried to print my pictures the paper kept getting stuck and jamming the printer. I looked on the expiration date and it was for ""2008 2"". Mind you, I brought the film in September 2008. I opened another pack just to see if it was the film and not the printer and the same thing happened. The paper kept jamming the printer and not coming completely out.BEWARE--if you buy this product please check the expiration date. Unfortunately, I didn't open it until October, but it still should have been in excellent condition."
4,Sony SVM-75LS Ink and Paper Value Pack,"I bought this ink/paper pack because it was displayed on the same page as the Sony DPP-F700 photo printer with the title ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" displayed over it. I assumed it was the correct ink/paper for that printer. Well, we all know what assuming does, so I had to return it. If you are looking for supplies for the Sony DPP-F700 the correct ink/paper is SVM-F120P.I gave this item 4 stars only because Amazon.com won't let me post this without rating the item. As it has the wrong size ribbon for my printer, I never actually used it."
5,Sony photo paper,The three pack bundle is a great value and it is very very hard to find a better price than Amazon
4,Clarity & Speed,I have been using the Sony dye-sub printers for close to 8yrs and I think they are the best quality prints that you can get in about 90secs.
4,Decent Value,"This product is slightly outdated, but if you're like me and you won't give up on your older photo printer, you're in luck. I have had no problems with the cartridges or paper."
3,Good product but way over priced.,You can pay to have photos developed CHEAPER! I don't know how they can charge so much for 75 pictures. If you do the math and add in postage and tax you could just about pay a photographer to take the 75 pictures for you. I am going to use what I have and sell my photo printer. IT IS NOT WORTH the extra cost to print at home.
1,"Tampered packaging, produced great pictures anyway","One ribbon cartridge had been opened and taped shut.One paper pack had been opened and then mixed with other types of paper.I had to sort and shuffle the paper to make it a standard kit.The printing from the tampered packaging was perfect. There were no side effects from the tampering on the quality of the printing.In general, I rate the product as 5 stars. The one star rating is for defective packaging of moisture sensitive media."
1,Shame on you Sony!,"Shame on you Sony! This was a great printer that cost me 40 cents per print back in the day -- expensive but worth the quality. Now the supplies are so highly priced prints cost about $3.00 each. I paid $160 for this printer. It's going in the trash and I'm getting a Canon Selphy CP900. Someone is making too much money on this and Sony is helping to fill our landfills. Fellow consumers unite and don't buy Sony products. Corporate shenanigans like this are disgraceful -- and perhaps illegal. (I recall reading you can't sell retail products in New York State (where I live) over the MSRP.) Thus depending on Sony's MSRP it may be the retailers at fault. Whomever is behind this, I hope some watch dog reads this and calls you on this one. Consumers, your power is the power not to consume. Help send a message."
4,No longer available!!!,"It is REALLY too bad that SONY discontinued this paper and ink. I have the printer and it still works great, but if I can't get the paper pack it is useless. I am sure that there are many people in this position. Great little work horse of a printer.. Really too bad."
5,Sony SVM- 75LS Ink and Paper Value Pack,I like the quality and convenience of this product. It was shipped in a very timely manner.
5,worth it,This ink and paper value pack is a really good buy. I really don't think you will be disappointed once you purchase this product. You will get 75 pieces of printing paper with this deal and that should be enough to show you how much of a great deal this is.
5,WHAT A JOY!,"This cd represents everything that I love about African music -- the energy, the instrumentation, the absolute beauty of Dikongue's voice. The arrangements are wonderful -- bouyant but not too heavy -- and carry the listener along so effortlessly that the cd is over before you know it (but it's a generous near-60 minute journey). I missed him when he came to Austin last year -- a big disappointment for me, but maybe I'll see him next time. If you enjoy ANY aspect of African music, you owe it yourself to check this out. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,Doll Size Chair,This chair is extremely small with a very low seat height. Good for display or dolls. IMO not to be used as a desk chair - even for an elementary school child. I would estimate this chair is best for 2-3 year olds tops.
2,Paint problems,"We were so excited to get this chair! We bought black for my son, purple for my oldest daughter, and this aqua for my youngest daughter. But, the paint smugded off on the neutral-colored table we bought, as well as onto our light-colored wood floors. We had to return all the colored chairs :("
1,"Tippity, rickety, already gone","Within two months one of the slat things came off the back. My kids tipped them about 50,000 times. I already Yard-Saled them and cursed myself for wasting money. Invested in more expensive, higher quality chairs and never looked back. If you need a great kid chair look at the storage chairs at Land of Nod. Untippable, heavy-duty and great looking pieces of furniture. Really... Please don't bother with these chairs."
3,Small,The chair is made well and my daughter loves it but it is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.
2,Wrong size for the desk,"Purchased three chair as a desk chairs for 7 years old kids based on Amazon's ""Frequently Bought Together"" for a student desk. The chairs were too short for the desk. Had to return them !!!"
5,great kids chair,I bought this chair for my grandson because I had a black table from when I was a child. The chairs were broken and I needed a replacement. This one is perfect. It is a little high for him but he manages to get on it. It is a very well made chair and I am sure it will last through my other grandchildren.
4,chair,I bought the table and chairs for my grandchildren. It was easy to assemble and looks great. I would recomend this to anyone with toddlers.
3,Amazon packages this item with Home Styles 5530-16 Naples Student Desk (DON'T DO IT),Amazon packages this item with Home style Naples Student Desk 5530-16 THE CHAIR IS TO SMALL FOR THE DESK!!!!This is either Amazon or KidKraft fault.But overall quality of chair is very good for a 2-5 year old.
1,Incomplete,I have six Nora Roberts books that are not listed in this book and I know of at least one more. There is no series number or publishing information included for the books it does list.
4,Overall - pretty good,"Although there are many books not listed (due to the year it was published), I find this checklist very useful. I just hope that they make a new one soon!"
3,Okay,"Hoping to replace a more expensive lotion with this but it just didn't work as well. It was okay, but going forward will splurge for the brand name product."
4,Good info,DR Paul Bragg had a good thing going trying to educate people abpout diet and junk food befor it was popular. His books are worth getting and I belive you will find at least a couple health tips for every person.
5,What a wounderful work...,"If you play classical guitar, you know that the Villa-Lobos 12 studies are one of the most important pieces to help maintain or improve your technique.What a wonderful interpretation by Mr. Kraft!"
4,A nice collection of all 23 guitar solos by a talented composer,"This CD is a treat in that you get all 23 guitar solos on one CD played to perfection by Norbert Kraft. I found the pieces to be firmly grounded in South American folk music, possibly even Latino street music, with just a touch of the influence of jazz. The works are sometimes complex and at others almost minimal. Kraft plays with technically perfect style, clean and exact, with every note in place. I find that this CD is also non-intrusive when reading or working at home."
5,Villa Lobos Guitar Sonority,"No wonder the genius of classical guitar of Spain asked Villa-Lobos to write pieces for him. The difficulty of his assigment left this performer in a constant amazement. The sonority of his chords, the constancy of his sequency, the move to and from exquisite sonority of phrases into silent assonance and dissonance. He was Andrés Segovia and this was the fifties. Now we find this soul brother to the Spanish master, Norbert Kraft, repeating, if not improving his forebears: great! We need more of this in our everyday life, this energy that propels us to the space. Welcome Kraft, welcome encore, Villa-Lobos. GF (still write it here for lack of adequate locale)"
4,First-class modelling by first-class model,"Johan Paulik is one of Europe's few gay porn superstars. Here he is in all his beauty. Bel Ami is perhaps getting a bit boring, but at least you know what you get - the colors, the poses are incredible.As anyone who has tried nude modelling will know - looking this fit, humorous and unstressed is not easy, Johan Paulik is surely one of the top models.This is a five-star book, but if you prefer some more XXX-action (like me), you will prefer the videos..."
3,"Very, Very short, should be priced at under $10","This book will only be of use to you if you have a business or plan on starting one. Makes a couple good points on what a business should consist of without ever giving specific advice on what type of business to start. Very short, only 36 pages of the actual text, this book took me about an hour to read from front to back. The text is only on the right pages, on the left is one quote from the right side of the book. The whole book could be summarized in about one page, it does make a couple good points though, but I'm not going to give them away since they are the whole book. There is a little advertising of his seminars, but nothing too bad where it would turn you of from reading the book. I expected a little more from Harv, his 1st book had a lot more solid info, despite the fact that he kept promoting his seminars. Speedwealth wasn't informative enough, since I bought the book I might reread the whole thing again on one of my lunch breaks at work."
5,Great Service & Good Value for the Money,GREAT service and good value for the money. A great product for your feline friend. We would buy from them again.
3,"Excellent overview, . . but don't treat too seriously","For anyone looking for a quick and easy way to learn about world myths, I doubt that there is a better source. It's well written and very comprehensive, although occasionally a little repetititve.BUTthis is no scholarly work. First many of the quotes are from other popular secondary sources, such as Thomas Cahill's books. Also, wherever possible the author tries to be politically correct. This descends to the point of self-parody where he is disussing native americans. I seem to remember this tendency was also there in his civil war book and it's stopped me ever reading his ""Don't know much about history."""
2,disappointed ....,"I have read many of Davis's other books (history, bible etc) and enjoyed them. He combined homor/wit with useful and interesting insights and still managed to make each book educational. His writing was entertaining and I was inspired to investigate each topic further. So, it was with great anticipation that I approached the mythology book, I have a long standing interest in archealogy and mythology, and was sadly disappointed. I ""don't know much about"" what happened to Davis in this book but his writing seems to have lost along the way the very things that made him different. This book was very dry and difficult to get through with little humor or novel insight. If you want to read something this tough to tackle, try Bullfinch (still dry but more info). Maybe he thought he needed to be a ""serious"" writer ... I don't know but I hope that whatever ails him is cured by his next book."
4,Fun and interesting read.,"If you are looking for good general information about mythology then this is the book for you. I have read this before and I am very interested in mythology. If you are looking for an insightful text into mythology this is not it. It has myths from all around the world. Well written, easy to understand so if you do not know much about general myths of the world then this is a good starting place."
1,reference material,Have not read downloaded only to learn about mythology but have yet to read. I hope to use as a reference.
2,a mistake,"In the Gift of the Nile chapter, the section titled Did pharaoh inspire Moses to worship one god? the author mistakenly claims that pharaoh orders the killing of all firstborn Israelites. See Exodus 1:15-22; 11:1-6; 13:15. Instead he orders the killing of all boys being born. It is god who kills the firstborn Egyptians."
2,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed with these. The top of each pocket is heavily slanted, not straight as pictured. I use these for cards and will have to send them back due to the poor quality."
3,good holders,"i thought that these were full pages but instead were just one dvd each, but still work pretty well, just will not fit into the big case one so you have to find a bind that fits the openings."
1,A Little Something To Passover,"My community theatre group was about to produce a play called ""The Cemetry Club"" for our March dinner theatre. The story concerns three Jewish widows who visit their husbands graves.We wanted to try for authentic accents, so I purchased ""Acting with a Yiddish Accent."" The CD came with a small pamphlet giving suggestions on vocal inflections and tonal qualities. But, what good is the printed word when it comes to the actual flavor of an accent? Not much, unfortunatelyThe CD quality was good, but the subject matter was limited. It did try to provide cadence patterns and inflections, but it seemed to veer more into parody than actual speech."
4,Fun Toy,"I have 2 sons (ages 7 & 9) that have played with the Air Hogs Eradicator for over 2 months and still love it. The plane is made out of a light weight material, so you must be careful not to leave it on the floor or throw it in a toy box, but we have crashed it at the park probably close to 100 times and it keeps flying and hasn't had more than a scratch. I understand you can purchase replacement wings if they do break, but we haven't found this to be necessary. It is best to fly the plane in a large open area, away from roofs and trees. We have seen this plane fly for over 3 minutes at a time. Any wind gust will easily keep it in the air and cause it to go higher. We have bought this toy as a gift for several birthday parties and it has been a winner every time."
2,"Nice idea, but way too fragile","This is the fourth or fifth Air Hog we've purchased, and it will be the last for awhile. It broke on the second flight - the fuselage snapped right behind the wing area. We've owned several battery powered models, all of which have broken within the first hour of use.Our first purchase - an air powered model - lasted longer (it came with two sets of wings), but was still broken within 2 weeks.We are looking for something more durable now - the concept is great but they just need to be tougher."
1,disappointed,This book is way too old to be much use. I did get one piece of information that's useful; don't use Ivermectrin de-wormer on lactating or pregnant goats. My vet told me to worm my pregnant goats with Ivermectrin and I think it caused problems. Not many large animal veterinarians have the right info for goats. It's very frustrating to not have the correct info I need.
3,"decent, not great. they're a half inch wide","You have to wrap the entire tie around the cables until the hooks and loops meet at the end. It's only 1 inch at the end where it sticks together. Nice colors, I wish they were a little wider."
4,Handy Dandy,"These are great little items that I use to get rid of tangled, slithering messes. They are fast to use and super-useful to organize your cords with little work. And it looks like you spent time doing it or are naturally well-organized. They are good on cords of all sizes too so you don't need to worry about sizing. They just put everything in order and make finding the cord you are looking for easy with the different colors."
5,Make your cables neater to clean your workspace,"I use these cable ties to make my workspace neater, make our cables for our networking equipment, and also to make the cables in our entertainment center neater, and they work well, and best of all, are reusable, so if I need to add or remove a cable, it's as easy as undoing a few cable ties."
3,Good for listen music but not so good on talking,"I have Cingular Sync. I bought this mainly for listening to the music. It is fine with the music quanity. However, the phone quanity is not so good. The other end can't hear me well."
5,Does the job. What more can you want?,"I've used them a few times already on my duffle. They're not going to make your bag bulletproof. They just help to ""keep honest people honest"" and that's it. If someone wants in your bag bad enough...they'll find a way and you'll have to accept it afterward. It's nice to know the TSA won't ever have to break 'em though."
3,Yoke Shire - Jethro Tull Meets ZZ Top,Yoke Shire is a rather unique band. At the time of this release they were a 3 piece with two brothers Craig and Brian Herlihy on a full arsenal of different instruments and Brad Dillon on drums and percussion. The band reminds me of what would happen if ZZ Top morphed with Jethro Tull. It is a very odd combination and on this album sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The album in bluesy in spots and progressive rock oriented in others. The second half of the album works as a sort of suite where the main theme appears again and again. I have mixed feelings on this album. Parts I really like and parts I don't particularly care for. It is certainly unique and I am guessing would probably appeal to fans of Jethro Tull especially the early more blues oriented material.
1,Full of errors and mistakes,"Well, I brought the book because of its good rating and time saving index cards. I just finished going through all of the index cards. I am a Chemistry major so I don't know enough to comment on the Biology part objectively. However, the Chemistry and the Physics parts are horrible. There are many errors in the cards some even have the wrong formula on it. Also many materials that I think are important are missing or hardly touched. I strongly discourage any students to use this book for preparation usless you have a good background on the subjects. Although the index card are surely easier to carry around, however studying the wrong formula will definitely hurt your MCAT scores more than helping"
1,"Nice Format, but Full of Errors","The index card format is a good idea. The cards are no substitute for a more comprehensive subject review, but they may be useful for jogging your memory and for quick study sessions when you're on the go.There are, however, several significant problems with the book. The book includes some facts that are unlikely to be tested on the MCAT, and worse, omits other facts that are covered on the test. In addition, just thumbing through the book, I have already found several typographical errors, and on closer insepection, I expect to find factual errors too. Finally, the cards are not organized in a logical manner; they're just thrown together in no particular order. This is not helpful if you want to focus on a particular subject area.Unless you're VERY pressed for time, you will probably be best served by making your own index cards."
4,Good Supplement to a review book,I think these review index cards are good addition to a comprehensive review book. Use both a review book and this book (full of study index cards) together. I found it helpful. This book will only get better in the future.
3,EXPENSIVE TOY.,IT WILL ONLY FIT ONE OF THE MANY SIMILAR OLYMPUS STYLUS CAMERAS.THE LENS WILL FOG UP IF THE WATER IS COLD.GOOD QUALITY BUILT.
1,Bad Remastering For a Great Album,"I have the LP from the fifties, the CD released in 1985 and the Mobile Fidelity Version. I was just about to buy this new version, but changed my mind after reading some of the reviews. Songs For Swinging Lovers is just flawless: Nelson Riddle arangements, the band, the repertoire and Sinatra at his best. In You're Getting To Be a Habit With Me, Joe Comfort in the bass is a stand out.Great album, by all means."
5,Terrific!!!,I enjoy listening to every tune on this CD. If you're looking for a finger snapping Frank at his best - this is the album for you.
5,Sinatra & Riddle Develop the Concept Album,"This Sinatra-Riddle collaboration is the most impressive moment in popular music. You will not find another album to have the strength and swing as this one. Nelson Riddle's arrangement of ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" bleeds 'SINATRA'. This is the hippest of the Sinatra Capitol Concept albums. It is worth every cent to listen over and over again."
4,Come What May,"Although this lighthearted version of Sinatra doesn't appeal to me as much as his darker side does, there's no denying Riddle knows how to make anything swing, and the Voice delivered a tune--virtually any tune--better than jsut about anyone, save Ella Fitzgerald.And, while some of these tunes are a tad too cutesy for me, ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" is perfection, ""It Happened In Monterey"" shimmys seductively, and Sinatra's quiet approach to ""Anything Goes"" is charming."
5,"The Swingin'-est, BABY!","My fiance and I bought this cd for the one and only swingin' version of ""Love Is Here To Stay"" to be used as our first dance at our wedding. Now we listen to it every day for the hoppin' syncopation that only Frankie can provide. This is an interesting era for Frank-he was still smooth, but well on his way to the old man with attitude that he later became. The remaster is superb and the orchestration is truly something to cherish, since nobody seems to know how to do it anymore."
3,okay cookies,The picture makes the cookies look a lot better than they actually are. Its just too many cookies in a pack for 1 person to buy.
1,Will not buy another BJs DVD,"The animation was poor (and a bit odd and scary), and this video did NOT keep my son's attention. Veggie Tales is definitely the way to go if you're looking for a great Christian message delivered in a fun, creative, animated way. After trying our luck with BJs and with Little Angels, we're completely a Veggie Tales family now...everything else seems to be a waste of money :-/"
3,Not bad!,"Some of the player names are a bit cheesy, but the play is just as unpredictable as you'll find when playing online. This was great to download on my laptop while overseas and unable to get to an online game for awhile. It's interesting to see the results of playing on your own vs. going with the ""expert"" advice."
5,Excellent Software,"This software came out of research at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. The limit artificial intelligence opponents are widely considered the best in the world. The no-limit opponents are okay. They are fantastic for training up as a beginner, and the developers keep improving them. Playing against computer opponents I can easily get through 300 hands an hour. This software has improved my game about 10-fold."
3,**Not sure if this is still available** Read review,"I ordered this 10/20/2007 and didn't notice the 4-6 week estimated shipping time in the small text. When order, my order details show the estimated shipping time for the order as 3/2008!!! I have email support to see if this is accurate.I think the company has discontinued this software as I do not see it on their website anymore, and they only offers the pro version which is $129. Confirmation would be appreciated, or suggestions on other reasonably priced similar software. Thanks."
4,Best poker game I have ever played,"I have played a few poker style games, but now were ever like this. The ability to learn the game, then play AIs, and finally take what you have learned and play online in tournaments or free play. The only problem I had was that you couldn't play this on a lan. Other than that great progams."
4,I'm All IN,Bought this to improve my skills at Texas Hold Em. In-hand tools are very helpful and it has taught me more about when to play and when to fold. It considers your hand plus the other players plus table position and has broken my habit of focusing so much on my hand. Besides all that the game is fun. You can play stand alone againt the AI players...these are tough players. I think they can see my cards : ) The most fun for me is connection to PA Online which is an area of tables and tournaments against real players for PAX (play chips). The community is made up of good players and is a friendly environment. It is the best play chip games I have experienced and I have played at most of the online sites. I got the MAC (because why would anyone own a PC?????) version and it works very well...stable network performance.
3,Only 12 discs??/,"I've seen case logic's that hold 24 mini discs, and for only 3 dollars more too. i think its a bum deal and that you should continue to shop until you find something that will allow you to expand your MD collection"
3,Ok...,"...but not as good as Part 1, less inspired...but the first one also had a great premise to start with - and for those few of you who don't know what I'm talking about, pick up a copy of Mr Murder...it's here it all began :)"
4,Good case could be better,good but can be alot better. I was hoping for a hole in the side so my headphones could work while my mini disk player was in the case. otherwhise this is the perfect case
5,Wonderful,This case was perfect for my Nomad II. I could carry it around anywhere without it getting bumped or scratched. It even had enough room for extra batteries. Over I would recomend this product to anyone with an MP3 player.
1,Not as fresh and the earlier ones.,"I do not like this album as much as the earlier ones. I feel that Nova Tunes Vol 2 is far much better. You should go for Hotel Costes or some of the Hed Kandi stuff, if you are thinking of investing in a chilling CD..."
4,Nice but a littleBigger that wht I expected,"I love this. I have it now for about three years and it looks just like new. It is a little bigger and higher that wht I was expecting so make sureYour space is big enough...take measurements before purchase...I had to cut it la few inches the table and chairs since it looked so big in my tiny kitchen too high, but I love the look and quality.."
3,"Get a pro, even for the backyard","The backyard double 3/4 cock is clearly not as stout as the Professional model.One arm failed after limited usage, because of a welded surface that isn't square.Get the professional model, which is a different, better design."
1,Bad strings,"Chose these strings simply because they were cheap, and that's what I got. Not 5 minutes after tuning standard tune, one of the E strings snapped."
2,Good at some parts but Mostly Pathetic.,"I read 'Annie's Baby' about a year ago. I was expecting something powerful, maybe even touching. But instead what I got was a load of junk! This Character 'Annie' starts out seeming like your average teen. When she discovers herself as pregnant it all turns downhill. The Author seems to excuse her responsibility by making her a victim of rape and creates a whiny bratty girl. Annie is nothing but selfish through most parts and also very foolish. She wants an abusive boyfriend even after everything he's ever done to her. The ending was sappy and perhaps unrealistic and it frightens me that the Author has this character fight with her 'Diary'. My advice: if your looking for some that's sad and a bit on the unreal side go ahead. Don't expect an award winning book though."
2,Eh,"I though that this book contained a fairly accurate sterotypical summary of a pregnant teen, however I feel like the 50 year old pyscologist are going a bit overboard with the whole pretend diary thing. Unlike go ask alice, I didnt for one seond consider it was real. This book is good if your just reading it for kicks, but if your reading it to get someones first hand expierance, I dont recomend it."
2,"easy read, but tends on the unbelievable side","When I saw that my younger sister was reading this book, I was very intrigued and asked to read it after she had finished...The whole thing took just about 2 hours to read, with nothing much to reccomend it in the end. 'Annie' is an unbelivably 2 dimensional character, the dialogue was laughable and the overall tone from the introduction to the final page was preachy. The one thing that this book has to reccomend it is the quizzes included along with the journal, which may help adolecent girls (and women of any age) to reciognize an abusive relationship when they see one. Otherwise, give this one a miss."
3,Good Book,"I thought this was a pretty good book. It was very depressing to read, but honestly, the girl is stupid. The story was drawn out and the ending sucked! It left me hanging, I just didn't get what she decided to do."
5,Annie's Baby,"This was actually the first book I ever decided to read on my own in middle school. Many people might have different point of views about this book. Some people will love this book and others will think is a waist of time. I will be honest, I really thought it was a good book. I don't back up domestic violence but it help me understand what real life can be. Either way if this book is based on a real diary or not, There is cases like this in this world. We might not hear these cases but year 2012, you will see 12,13,14, or 15 year girls getting pregnant! im 26 years old now, i was probably 13 when i read this book. Trust me is worth reading. I don't see why schools banned this book from the libraries. It's a book that every teenager should read and for them to understand life a little bit more."
1,Completely and udderly ridiculous,Beatrice sparks is a complete phony! You can obviously tell that this book is not a diary and sounds like anything else she writes. This book is racist and she juts her religion I. Your face worse than any Mormon I know. This was a waste of money for me and a waste of time. Not all teen pregnancys turn out bad and make you want to kill yourself.
2,This book is not realistic,This book is not realistic even the least bit. I myself use to be a counselor for pregnant teens and many pregnant teens are not as naive as this girl is here. I don't believe this is the diary of a young girl if it is. I apologize. But if its not. I don't apologize. This book is not realistic even in the least. There are parts that are. But maybe one or two of them. But the rest is just not realistic at all. Total waste of time of paper and ink.
5,awesome,i like seriously liked this book. it was really good and i cried alot cuz its emotional. it makes it even better that its a true story because its not fake and the person who wrote it obviously experienced it not like other authors who think they like know what theyre talking about when they write a book like this. i totally encourage you to buy this cuz its hella good!
1,No comment,This book made me sick.How can a fourteen year old still stay with an abusive boyfriend who rapes her?I hope people are not like this in real life it's really shameful and naming the baby sfter her?
1,this book sucked more schlong than the main character!,"This book was horrible. Halfway through the book i was wondering why i hadnt blown my brains out, and then i remembered that it was the zoloft i was taking!"
3,The Pregnant Teen,"I thought Annie's Baby was an okay book. It showed the thoughts and feelings of a pregnant teen, but was unrealistic. I think the author tried too much to make teen pregnancy seem so horrible. The way she wrote was not really like a teen girl, but all in all, the book was interesting. It was also helpful, and I would recommend it to any teen."
4,she was kind of dumb!,"It was a good book but it she was kind of dumb at first because tell me what 14 yr old act like that i know it was her first boyfriend but com,e on but after the fact that happened to her and danny it got really good i couldn't put the book down she went through a lot just to do what she did at the bottom but i think thats what goes through every teenage parent mind and good thing she had a understanding mom because if she didnt she would have been ... out."
2,Not Great,"This book is okay. I didn't understand how the title goes with the story? They hardly talk about the baby besides in the end and not even that much. Plus when she writes in her diary she always says sorry for saying something she is expressing. Why would you say sorry for expressing how you feel? Anyways the story is okay, but If you have the chance to get this book or something else get something else!"
1,Shameful,"Beatrice Sparks is the author/editor of a serious of ""anonymous"" teen diaries. They are meant as ""warnings"" to children. In fact, they are not based on real diaries and the only one that actually was, she used about 10% of the journal entries and added a Satanic theme which horrified the family.Now I am aware that children should be taught such things as drugs are bad, teenage pregnancy is not preferable, don't kill yourself etc. However, I take offense when presented in this manner. Children learn best from the truth not extreme propaganda. I also take offense that many libraries (especially school libraries) list this book as non-fiction, when in fact it is a work of fiction."
1,Hardly helpful...,"I bought this book because I am a pregnant teen trying to inform myself. This book bothered me because it is written at a third grade reading level, and all Annie does is complain. She never ONCE says she even cares about her baby, let alone love her. It is the epitimy of all the bad things that can happen in teen pregnancy."
3,Annie's Baby,"I just read 'Annie's Baby' and, while I enjoyed the story line to a point, I found it to be unrealistic. The book made all teenage mothers out to be bad and than irked me. It also made all teenage fathers out to look bad and unresponsible which is almost like and excuse for some who read the book. I thought the story was mostly good but the ending was disapointing..."
4,Read and liked it,This is a good book. I'm a teenager and I felt sorry for Annie. I kinda felt like I knew where she was coming from with being all in love and stuff. She made a tough desicion and accepted it. I really liked to book and want to read GO ASK ALICE now.
4,Really Good Book,"i finished this in less then a day, i honestly couldnt put it down. even though i am 2 years older, and not pregnant, i could relate to annie. it changes my perspective on young pregnant teenagers and i repect them alot more. i would recommend this book for mature teens, probably more so for girls then guys. i hope i was helpful"
2,Quite a waste of my money,"When I bought this book, I thought it might be like those ""Go Ask Alice"" types. Boy I was so wrong! This stupid Annie is still madly in so-called, ""love"" with her irresponsible boyfriend who made her pregnant and battered her. I mean, duh? I am so dissapointed with this book. It seemed unreal, somehow. The best way to enjoy this book is to borrow it somewhere and never ever read it again, bcos if you do, you'd feel like throwing up."
1,"Fake, fake, fake",This book is just another ghostwritten novel presented as real by the Queen of Fakery Beatrice Sparks. Don't waste your time or money.
1,I spent money on this?,"I begged people to borrow money for this book, because I read the back cover and thought it would be another ""go ask alice"" (which I highly recommend). Turns out, it wasn't. It was some unrealistic story about some unrealistic, irresponsible teenager. It's a complete waste ...time."
4,Good book to consider,"Having met many young people in a town where 12 year olds having children is a regular occurence, I think this book is very realistic. It sounds as if it were written by a young, uneducated girl--much like many of my Girl Scouts, who are not much younger than Annie. A good read for young women who are considering having sex, but think that pregnancy won't happen to them."
4,A Must Read For All Teen Girls!!!!!!!!(And Guys),"Annie is athletic and has a good life. She even has the best boyfriend, Danny. All that stops when Danny rapes her. Still, Annie keeps coming back to Danny. Then, she finds out she's pregnant. This book portrays the hard life Annie and any other teen mother must go through. It's an amazing read!"
3,This book was ok.,"This book was about a 14 year old girl named Annie, who becomes involved with a 16 year old boy, whom she allows to take over her life. She thinks about him constantly and becomes so obsessed with him that she ignores his abusive side. When she becomes pregnant, and then has the baby, she has a hard time accepting that she is responsible for it's care.I don't really know if I believe that this is taken from a real girl's diary. In any case, the author, Beatrice Sparks, creates convincing characters, especially the main one, Annie.Overall, I thought this was a good book, and I enjoyed reading it."
5,Sad and Beautiful,"Annie's Baby is a very good book and I highly recommend it. This book surprised me because of the shocking abuse and her confusion. Annie was so innocent and naive (not stupid!). The fact that she was so innocent and sweet and had so many troubles made the book so sad. The fact that she was pregnant was not the sad part, I do not think it is really ""wrong"" to get pregnant at a young age, but she had never experienced anything very harsh until she met Danny. She was so inexperienced that she believed him and trusted him. I wanted to protect Annie and warn her. This book is not unrealistic. Annie's Baby is so incredibly real that I felt tears in my eyes. Annie and her baby were real people. Annie's story could hep many teens avoid unhealthy relationships and possibly unwanted pregnancy. Annie is really a very brave girl and she deserves respect."
4,"Good,..But Disappointing","The book is very good, because it is very real. However she takes the easy way out, and however good it may have been for the child, it is still disappointing. I do applaud Annie and I can only hope that her young self truly made the right decisions, and hope that she left everything open, a child has the right to know that she has been adopted and to know the birth parents!"
3,I dont know,I read this book my freshman year of high school. The reason i choose to read it was because i found out it had the same editor as Go as Alice and i loved that book. When i started readign this book u realized it was very easy to read but it just gets anoying. The girl is a complete idiot. I understand she was young but come on. Even after he found out she was pregnant and said he wanted nothin to do with her she still wanted to be with him. He kept hurting her and she kept coming back. It's a good book and the ending is intresting. I think you should read the book because you'll like the ending.
3,Go Ask Annie,"Annie's Baby is a book about a fourteen year old girl who - you guessed it - has a baby. Some parts are kind of unrealistic. For example, there's one part when her mom goes to talk to her old boyfriend after Annie becomes pregnant, and immedeatly backs down when he threatens to ruin their reputation. Another unrealistic part is when she writes one last entry in her diary while she is having her baby (""Oww this hurts!"").But besides that, it's an okay book which I reccomend for ages 9 and up. It makes a good companion with Go Ask Alice or It Happened to Nancy."
3,Rectangular's The Way To Go,"In general, I 'insist' on this shape. It allows both my eyes to easily focus on a particular point and I find, especially over time, that this results in much less eye strain.I do wish the lens were 1"" larger, however; that would make scanning page-wide lines of text much easier.And a glass rather than plastic lense, tho weighing more, would be [$$$} ideal.I'm not really comfortable about the grade of plastic used here and, totally without proof other than 'feel', fear it will not withstand scratching.Naturally, the 'eyeglass' materials I've grown used to would also be awfully expensive."
3,A little reference book,"I was looking for a book that could give me detailed dining or eating things in a party.If someone serves ice cream on a tray, where the ice cream is served on a gobble with a saucer and you are sitting down, how do you take the ice cream?When I saw the book I was surprise of the size, it was so tiny, like a little dictionary. Most of the things were the same things from the Emily Post's Etiquette book.The information in this book is very good, but it lacks scenarios. Sometimes you come across situations that you can't find anywhere.And you won't find in this book either.We know where all the utensils suppose to go. You can find these kind of information anywhere.It is a good reference book for someone that doesn't know anything. But for those looking for an extra information, it is better to purchase just the Emily Post's Etiquette book.I would purchase this book only if you are looking for a small reference book that gives tips on basic dining."
4,Economics:Principles and Practice,"Clayton's book is probably the best of an okay batch. After teaching high school economics for 14 years, and having used Clayton for roughly 8 of those years, I have found the book useful. The problem I have with the book is its non standard sequence of economic topics. This is a result of California State curriculm standards not Clayton. The author makes the best out of a bad situation. Consequently I teach the material in the sequence I prefer. This is okay while teaching supply and demand, and other micro issues. When I hit macro economic subjects it just falls apart. I have to cobble together bits and pieces of chapters to get a sequence resembling anything like a standard college sequence of topics;measurement (national income accounting, inflation, and unemployment), circular flow, determinants of aggregate demand,...etc. But of the text on the adopted list I prefer it."
4,Great for the Price,"Having had a Nike watch before, I hoped my husband would like this one, too. There aren't as many bells and whistles as his other one, but it is half the price!"
4,great qigong manual,"As a long time practitioner of qigong, I have never been a fan of Mantak Chia's work; I found his books to be too scattered, and difficult to piece together. Yudelove manages to take Chia's system, and not only make it understandable, but also make it safe by adding the element of timing and systematic practice.This book is clearly written, fun to read, and packed full of good info. The only caution would be that I would not recommend it for beginners; I think that many of the practices are outside the beginning level ability to feel what all those metaphors are talking about. It is a supurb text for those who have some level of development-- this is the difference between high school and 300 level college credits.All things said and done, this is the best book on the subject matter I have ever read. For better beginning texts, I would check out ""opening the energy gates of your body"" by B.K. Frantzis, and ""the way of energy."""
1,Not worth buying,"This game will let down anyone playing it on the 360 - they threw this together in a few weeks and didn't take advantage of the 360's processing power. The graphics are worse than would be expected for the older XBox, the gameplay is lacking, minor bugs hamper gameplay and the game is not much fun. I rented this and beat it in a few hours, picking up a few hundred achievement points in the process, but never found it to be challenging or fun. Rent it if you must, but don't expect to spend more than 5 hours playing it.Overall - this is a huge letdown, just like most games that are tied into movies. The goal isn't to create a good game, but to have something extra to sell fans the moment the movie comes out. I wish there were some better games based off Marvel Comics... is that so much, as a fan, to ask of the publisher?"
4,Good Game!,I thought this game was pretty cool. I read the reviews but took a chance. Especially for the price this game is not that bad. I play it with my two nephews and we have alot of fun.I love the comic book games. Give this a try for the price. A.L from Albuq.
3,"OK, nice try",Its a nice try by 2K to make a Superhero game but they did not really pull it off. A mediocre Game and a easy challenge. Not a A Grade Game But descent.The campaign is short and easy other than the few times you have no idea what to do and considering how simple the game is thats sad. The game also has ZERO 360Live Features.Another Movie-To-Game Disaster.
2,Great Game.....if it's 1995!,"Gameplay much like X-men or Marvel Ult. Alliance, except more repetitious and a lot less fun. Dialogue makes a few sorry attempts at humor, and characters are not drawn consistently (they actually look slightly different throughout the game). Game will take approx. 4 hrs to beat on normal mode, did not bother playing advanced mode. This game is a dud that I am sure will soon be able to be picked up around $25-$30, and really may not be worth that."
3,Good if played under certain circumstances.,"The First circumstance that is needed is that you didn't pay 60 dollars for this game. It is not at all worth it. It is all right to rent and beat in your five evenings. The second is that you are playing with one or two players. Normally, as with X-Men Legends and Ultimate Alliance, it is most fun to get as many players as possible, however the horrible camera views and matching costumes will get so frustrated you cannot continue the game. To players are best to beat this game and get it over with."
4,Cry decent,"A good, solid journalistic thriller. Not as good as Handberg's first novel, Savage Justice, nor his two later books, Malice Intended and Dead Silence, still, Handberg, who was news director at the formerly great Twin Cities WCCO television station (come back, Ron! Come back!), obviously knows the business of TV news and the feel of the Twin Cities. His books are always great ""beach books."" Smart, crisp, entertaining."
5,Excellent buy,"I was leary of buying 'off-Amazon,' but it worked out great. For the money, this is a fine piece of furniture. It's more substantial than I expected. Firm enough to place a cup of hot coffee on, soft enough to be a very comfortable foot rest, and large enough that you can do both at the same time. My 2-year-old loves to lay on it to watch TV and color and play. It's great. Shipping was good too - it actually arrived early."
1,I have not yet received this book. I am very upset. I need my money back.,"I am vey disappointed because up till this momment I have not received this book. I have called amazon and they told me to wait. It is more than a month now, still no book. I want my money back ASAP."
1,"If I could give it ""zero"" stars I would ....","I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend's daughter. My son has one - a generic one from a local drugstore - and loves it. I thought Franklin was a better name, and since I was giving a gift, I wanted to get something a little nicer than our $2 one from Walgreens. What a mistake!!! After two uses, the Velcro is already coming off of the paddles, and it's utterly useless. I was embarassed to see it when my friend showed it to me, and I felt so badly as this was a gift. Do not waste your money. Buy a cheaper model elsewhere - at least you won't be as upset if it doesn't work out."
5,Excellent Product & Prompt Delivery,"This item was exactly as described in the item description. It was in the original packaging and is in excellent condition. I am very satisfied and I highly recommend this seller and product to everyone. These work great with the whistles that FOX 40 makes, which are very high quality. I used them for my lifeguards at a camp this summer and they work very well."
1,Too expensive,"For the price, I was expecting a dozen lanyards, not one lanyard. I'm not sure why green lanyards are so much more expensive than any other color. Very disappointed."
3,Smaller than I expected,"I was excited for these, however when they arrived I couldn't believe how small they were. They are in the shape of lips, just small and thin. I used them on cake pops when I was making people. I wish they were slightly bigger and fuller. I think they would be cute sprinkled all over vs. one pair."
5,Awesome product,"Excellent, well made product. Easy install and works GREAT. I transport musical equipment to and from gigs in the back of my truck and this item was just the ticket to keep things safe and dry. Well engineered and works fantastic. Quick shipping as well. After LOTS of shopping around, this turned out to be the best choice and lives up to all the great reviews."
3,"Shell is excellent, sleeves...not so much!","The hard shell is definitely durable and could last for years. Paradoxically, the inserted sleeves (which don't seem easily replaceable either) rip and tear easily, even under gentle and especially reasonable usage. If you were buying this for rugged usage, I definitely would not recommend it."
1,An absurd eugenics future is described on this book,"I read many parts of this bad book, on an internet site.This trash-book describes an absurd future, when mankind is guided by eugenics principles.Trash-books such as this or ""The population bomb"" are good only for dumbs,racists or mads."
5,"Say AMEN to ""Saying Amen: A Mystagogy of Sacrament""","Saying Amen: A Mystagogy of Sacrament is a light-hearted book that looks at the role of the sacraments in the Catholic Church. It not only gives a mystigogical perspective of the sacraments, but a brief history and theology as well. Hughes writes this book with clarity and pizzazz. One can not help but become excited and enthralled as she writes about the lost act of contemplation. Besides contemplation, she also writes about ""Mystagogy as Method,"" ""Paying Attention,"" and separate chapters for each respective sacrament. This book not only educates one on the practices and beliefs that the sacraments entail in the Church, but also provides thought provoking topics that are garenteed to call for reflection and arouse discussion. A must read for all!"
3,"Solid theology, partially drowned in idealism","Kathleen Hughes provides a solid background, devoid of trendy cliches, covering mystagogy and contemplation in relation to the sacraments. Though a bit more historical perspective would have improved the approach, the underlying ideas are far sounder and more enlightening than in most popular books on the topic of liturgy.Nonetheless, there are deficiencies. The idea of letting people speak of their experiences has some validity, but that many would have incorrect impressions of underlying doctrines is largely ignored. The author, quoting individual cases, is idealistic and, in effect, rather narrow, as if symbols (for example, immersion of a nude baby in baptism as far superior to other forms) thrill everyone and would be common in appeal to all.The scholarship is rich, but some of the application a bit too ""parish discussion group"" for my own taste."
1,Expired treats,"Took way over two weeks for the bag to arrive just to find out they expired 6 month ago. Site ays shipment weight 11 oz, package that arrives is only 2.4oz. Do not recommend to anyone to order from this site and for this price."
3,A Hodgepodge,"This contains some nice playing, but it was thrown together the night before the session, and it shows. The set is also not well-served by Buddy Emmons' croaking bar-band vocals. If you are a Lenny Breau or Emmons nut who has to have everything they did, then obviously you'll want this; but if you are looking for an introduction to either player (both masters), look elsewhere."
1,Skagen Men's Leather Watch #243LSLW,Sucks for average peopleBand is dirty in moments.Band is sized for Barry Bonds and steroid prone humana or perhaps gorillasShould be stated in your promo ads.Disappointing and so isAmazon.
1,Description,"I was intrigued by the description, ""Leather Watch"". What I see is a steel watch with a leather band. What did I miss?Does the band make it a LEATHER WATCH?"
5,Great information and entertainment,"The salvation of a dismal education system may be the Internet, the DVD and the interactive CD-ROM. Thos set of DVDs on the first World War is a case in point. As a teacher of history I know that if one is to inform a student, a certain amount of entertainment must go with the facts. This set meets both criteria.This may not be the ultimate, in-depth set of DVDs on the subject, but it is a superb start. It should be viewed by students and then discussed. The disks put this war in perspective with other events in Europe at the time of the war and in the decades leading up to it. After all, the war did not come out of the blue one day in Sarajevo.But this is also for the adult student with even a modest interest in history."
3,A good effort,"I picked up my copy from a jobber rack at a local supermarket. Given the price I wasn't expecting much but thought may would be worth a gamble compared to the Hollywood dreck in the neighboring bin.The well considered script, along with the substantial period film footage and inclusion of interviews - culled from an older program - kept my interest and left me ready each following program.The narration, is far from memorable, though seemingly competent in execution, save the pronunciation problems as pointed out in another review.I do concur with Mr. Graham in his review on the use of music in the soundtrack which will alter randomly between asynchronous an annoying. Even the music selection for the end credits seems flippant given the subject matter.For general consumption though these problems can likely be overlooked. This was a good effort by the producers."
1,"Inferior repackaging of material used in the superior british ""The Great War""","This is essentially a repackaging of the BBC series ""The Great War"" from the sixties. Same footage, same interviews, same prissy dramatization of David Lloyd George. The difference is that this is a much less chomphrehensive look at the war, and a much less professional production. The title cards are plagued by spelling errors, the music is a mishmash of classical tunes and the narration is inferior.Find ""The Great War"" instead of getting this. It's 27 hours of the best war documentary you'll ever see."
2,FOR A TEACHER - -TOUGH TO USE,The cost made it a bargain and I thought the video was not terrible but the narration was poor and the information was almost at water fall level....too much too quick. The students had a hard time following the causes. For an adult or history buff it comes across better.
1,misleading product,The text of this documentary is largely lifted from John Keegan's 1999 history of the war--and he's not given credit anywhere in the film.
1,Horrible Narration !,"OMG... After 10 seconds you will turn this off due to the Bad Narration. Very Monotone. The Video in the background is also disjointed and doesn't follow the bad narration. This Documentary is Soooo Bad, it must have been made by the Government. Its like a Post Office Training Lesson put to WWI Video."
5,WWI - Well Done,Very well done and informative - if your a history buff - you'll love this overview of WWI.Larry
2,I liked the episode on the air battles,I will agree with most of the other reviewers who indicated displeasure with the effort to produce this version and the low quality that resulted. I won't bother repeating all the comments they made which were all true but I will add that often the commentary and the video seemed to be about two entirely different things. The one shining episode was the one covering air battles. I did enjoy that one and hadn't seen the air battles covered very well in other WWI offerings.
2,Good idea....bad narration,"The narration in this video is like a high school film project. Great videos, but terrible narration. I would not recommend."
3,6th grade teacher,"I bought this DVD for my class studying WW1- it was done with authentic footage, but the language was way over their heads. I wish I bought the other one done in color. It was a good value and had lots of information, but a bit dry."
2,it's okay,"it must be hard to figure out what to write when your career spans over 40 years. it doesn't help that he didn't keep any journals either. this book seems like he wrote what he could remember at the moment. a lot of time spent on hendrix, and eric's view on how jimi died (not accidental). although the book kept me mildly interested, basically for nostalgia reasons, i didn't feel it really covered much, just a glimpse of his life. i'd love to know more about the new animals and his ""love is"" record. anyway, buy it for a quick read, but don't expect a lot of depth."
5,Very enjoyable read,"Absolute must-have for any Eric Burdon fan. He is a wonderful story teller and keeps you amused and interested all the way through. He's and gives a lot of personal info. as well as sharing some great anecdotes about life on the road etc. After reading his book and learning about all he's been through,(and that's only what he's shared with us) and after seeing him play some 40 years after his start - you can only admire the man !!"
4,Interesting Read.,"Since I am a fan, I wanted to know more about Eric. I saw him the last couple years at two outdoor concerts in Vegas and must say they were the most memorable and enjoyable concerts I have ever gone to. He is one singer who is like fine wine - improving with age.While I enjoyed the book and would recommend it, it seemed a bit disjointed to me. Let me just say that my impression is that while it starts at the ""beginning"" and finishes at ""an end"", what is in the middle (most of the book) is not too chronological. And I wonder too how accurate everything is.All that said, buy the book; it's cheap and it's certainly an interesting enlightening read for any Animals fan."
4,Overcoming Life's Obstacles,"""John Riley's Daughter"" is packed full of emotion. From the moment I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The author jumps right out and introduces you to Memphis. From that point on, my own emtions started running right along with Memphis. I loved the way the author, as she introduces you to each person involved in the life of Memphis during the next three days, blends and entwines thier own emotions which in the end will have a positive influence on Memphis in working through this awful time in her life. I came away after having read ""John Riley's Daughter"" with a warm, happy feeling. Happy for Memphis, who at such a young and difficult age experiencing so much hurt, was at last able to come to terms with herself and begin the process of healing and moving on with her life. Four stars to Memphis, and four stars to ""John Riley's Daughter""."
2,False Advertising,"This disc is actually missing almost all of Willie's best songs and biggest hits. Try ""Super Hits"" on Columbia instead."
2,Crappy version of Battlefield Bad Company,"This game was cool for the first hour I played it. Then I traded it in when Bad Company came out a few weeks later. Graphics, gameplay, and controls are all 50% of Battlefield. Do not waste your time with this game it is terrible."
5,better then a store,This game was for my daughter for Christmas she had played this game before and wanted it. This game was a third of the price as a store good deal would buy from them again.
3,Quake Wars review,"This game is meant to be played on multiplayer. That being said, there seems to be no one playing this game online. However, the campaign in single player will keep you busy for a while, and the ability to commandeer friendly vehicles is nice. If you just want to blast away at Strogg, or are a die hard Quake fan, get this game."
2,It is interesting to read.,"As this book, I think the writer wrote many things interesting to me. I'm came from another religion and I want to learn and study about Chritian that why I read this book. Some part, make me cannot understand and I want to know how to get a summarize or guildline in this book to me."
3,Made for wide feet,Good for folks with wide feet. I have average width and it looked quite large on me. You can probably size down.
3,Too Squishy!!!!!!,"This might sound weird, but these shoes are too sguishy. When I am taking my daily run, my shoes always hurt because it is too squishy!!"
4,"Never running out of questions to ask, and always engrossed in the answers!","This book was amazing in its capacity to create a three dimensionality, to an otherwise unacknowledged subject matter. In its pages the reader is almost shown a whole other ""history""/ ""historical sequence of events"" at least. These events, at least for me, were not part of the curriculum of American History during elementary school. Everyday I discover yet again, the truth in the statement, ""The more you learn, the more you will question, and the more you will find that you don't know/wish to know more about.""This title not only points the reader toward the shape that the events it is framed around may take, but guides the reader toward forming more questions."
4,Only 15 sleeves,"I actually got what I was hoping for, I was just not thinking about the Case Logic numbering. Remember to divide by 2 on most of their ProSleeves products."
4,chill smooth music,I orginally heard about this band on woxy.com and I loved what I heard. I actually listened to this for the first time on the way to the airport and the entire album is great. It is really a chill beautiful album with a feel good vibe.
5,This duo is fantastic,"I'm simply astounded that this band consists of only a drummer and a guitarist with a sick stack of effects. Cyriak animated a recent video of theirs, and if Cyriak likes it I know it will be good."
5,Excellent instrumental post-rock,"Heard about this band on a free Amazon sampler (the song ""Cease and Persist""). So far this is the only album I own but it is truly incredible from beginning to end, oscillating between catchy hooks and mellow almost-electronica sections. Listen to the tracks in order for the full effect."
3,"pell mell, mogwai, labradford, the sea and cake","any of the above bandnames mean anything to you?if so, you will find that L 10 11 hew to the lighter/happier side ofthe post-rock/instro-rock dialectic.very pleasant. very by-the-numbers, however.mogwai are WAY more intense, but if you want somethingto ease the pain of dusting yr furniture or scowering the bath, this is it.i know that sounds dismissive, and Bar None is a very venerable label...butprettiness, in this genre, is NOT ENOUGH.now, here are a few recommendations of transcendental stuff that is out therethese dark days: YO LA TENGO, THE BLACK WATCH, ROBYN HITCHCOCK, andMOGWAI!!!!!"
3,In a perfect world this would be bland,Effective if not entirely convincing short introduction to what instrumental rock fans of the introspective variety should have no problem savoring swaying with.
2,The Samurai,"The Samurai is an historical fiction that does give insight into 16th century Japan and the struggle between established culture and religion in Japan versus Christianity. Endo gives an interesting account that apparently mirror his own struggles with his beliefs; however, it's lackluster quality makes it sometimes a chore to read. Despite that, it is enlightening to see how the Church attempted to control Asia and how the indomitable spirit of the indigenous people affected the ousting of the Jesuits and other Christian sects."
4,excellent,"Great novel. Not as powerful as Silence but still a classic! Endo does an excellent job of showcasing the power of christianity without force feeding it the way a western writer would tend to. This story is very subdued and theres never that huge climax that some may expect, instead Endo carries strong points throughout the entire book. I dont quite understand the reviewer who said you cant learn everything about Japan in this book, was I supposed to?"
5,"The Flip Side Of ""Shogun"".","This is a wonderful book to contrast with Clavell's vastly more popular ""Shogun"". It is the grunt Samurai's view of the waning moments of Chistiandom in Japan. ""Samurai"" is a terrific period piece, deeply tragic, and a great adventure all-in-one. The story survives translation remarkably well, with the Japanese subtleties in tact. ""Samurai"" is a window to the traditional Japanese psyche."
4,Compelling narrarive,"Shusaku Endo is a great writer. The way he recreates with painstaking details both physical surroundings and state of mind of main characters leaves you feeling like you experienced it yourself. At the same time the main focus of this novel is religion, particularly christianity. The other stuff, such as description of travel by japanese envoys to Europe that took place in seventeenth century, although extremelly vivid and interesting, serves mostly as a background to more deeply embedded line of deliberation on the meaning of christianity. The book also helps to better understand the modern Japanese society through the prysm of the first experience between japanese and european societies. I gave it only four stars because I found the novel to be sometimes too slow, even repetitive, But it could me just my perception."
4,Enjoyable Facts and Fictions,"This book is about an 11-year old girl who discovers the real things and the dreams in her life. With trying to get a vibrato on her cello, helping a friend hide frogs, and trying to get her mom to understand her, this book was enjoyable."
3,One Great Song,Rick's follow up to Back To The Blues really flops.Hard to believe but true.If It's The Blues is the one great song on the CD. Some others have viablility but they get lost in the hodge podge of throw aways that clutter this hapless album.
1,Very disappointed,this microwave which was advertised as being an aid for the blind was nothing more than a touchpad microwave which was modified with hard to read and totally useless buttons on the side of the touchpad. My blind friend could not decipher the numbers nor could she find the actual touch pad.
3,High Quality but way too big.,I wanted a very large round brush. This brush is just way too big. Really cumbersome. It ended up being a waste of money since I've used it and cannot return it. People who think the bigger the better should reconsider. There is too much brush to control and it ends up being more of a pain then it is worth. That said - the quality of the brush is good. I may buy a smaller one from the same company.
3,Hard to hold and BIG!,"I have very long, thick, causasian hair. The seller should put a photo next to a person's head to better be able to tell the size of this brush (granted, they give the demensions, but I misjudged that)because this is HUGE. The handle is slippery and hard to get a good grip."
5,Best brush at a great price,"Spornette brushes with natural boars hair andnylon inserts are the best, bar NONE. I love my new brush it is large and I only have medium length hair but it helps to finish my look. I love it."
4,Good for extra light,I bought this light to put under a kitchen cabinet for additional lighting in a dark corner. It was easy to install & does the job. The only negative is that it is very hot on the high setting.
2,Peridots are darker than the picture,This bracelet has a good artisan's touch but the peridots are hard to see under inside lighting. The color of the stones are much darker than is shown in amazon's picture. It is a decent silver piece for a teenager and can probably be found alot cheaper at a local arts fair.
5,"Very Fine, Handy, and Enjoyable Video Guide","This is the old Mick Martin and Marsha Porter Video Guide that was so popular a while past; but is now out of print. I have always liked it, because of the politeness of their reviews, and the fact that they generally tried to review movies inside a type or ""genre"". I chose the 2000 guide because of two reasons. There were many interesting movies that came out in the year 1999 that I wanted covered; and (2) I was told that in later years, though M&P would still have the two indexes for actor and director, they were not titled as such at the top of the respective pages in the back. I find myself constantly referring to them. And it has worked out fine... I love this ""little"" guide... thick, though in main outlines, slightly smaller than the normal book. I hope M&P do come back; though ""Videohound"" does do a good job too."
5,best tasting,"I have purchased many different brands of this type of fruit. This is by far the best tasting of all I have tried. It has no ""off-putting"" bite to it. Many do! I love it so much I cannot stop making my homemade pannatone. I guess I can thank you for these 5 extra pounds!!! If you use this type of product(I am Italian) so I do, I highly encourage you to give it a try. maria domenica"
4,Good for recipes,I do a fair amount of German baking and several recipes use candied peel. My wife is allergic to corn and these are candied in corn syrup. I get around this by soaking them in warm water then rinsing in cold water thus removing most of the syrup.
3,Well written and yet I didn't like it,"While this story was well written and totally believable, I did not care for the storyline. Call me an old-fashioned thirty year old but [spoiler alert] a man stringing along one woman for marriage while fulfilling his sexual desires with another just isn't what I would consider romantic and this book was written within the romance genre. I understand, and find believable, the storyline of not knowing what you truly want out of life. I even appreciate the moments in which each character decides to face life-altering decisions such as marriage or the lack thereof. I recently read another Blaze series book that did something similarly and I can only hope that Blaze isn't leaving romance by the wayside for merely sex, for sex's sake."
1,"YOU'RE TOAST,","The film had me guessing...guessing how the main characters were related to the director/writer/producer/editor. They actually had a casting for this film when picking people out at random would have worked better.In the small town of Carol Steam, Illinois, a couple is murdered by a clown. After the credits Val (Kelli Clevenger) and Bobby (Paul Pierro) have a break up. For some reason Val leaves without her most prized possession, a clown doll. Soon friend Jim (Jay O'Connor)who was rough with said doll, is brutally murdered outside their home, with Bobby knocked out. For some reason there are no police in this movie who question the key witnesses or suspects. Things escalate and Bobby goes in and out of dreams and comas so you can pick which plot you like least.This is one of those films where the writing and acting are so bad it is a major distraction.Parental Guidance: F-bomb, no sex, nudity (Susie Grant, Michelle Brancato) Not worth watching for free."
4,$40 Bargain from Costco,"I purchased this watch on a lark for $40 from Costco. So far, looks and feels like a quality timepiece- a smaller footprint than other G-Shocks in my watch collection. I like the large display. I was a little surprised that I had to read the manual to understand some of the capabilities of the watch. I am a little disappointed in the design of the buttons- they are recessed and difficult to push."
4,Solid watch...no need to adjust or/and take off,"This watch is all around the best watch I have owned, and I have owned many. There really are only two down sides to this watch:1. Does not really look good when you are wearing a suit. So I go w/out on those days.2. The buttons in the beginning are hard to press.Other than that, the watch is solid as a rock. I figure after the battery dies in 10 years I will just buy a new watch/model instead of a new battery."
5,Atomic watch,"Since the purpose of a watch is to keep accurate time, you can't beat this watch for the money. I would buy another one today if I lost it."
1,Leaves a lot to be desired,"After 5 months the back light went out. I've had mine for 18 mos., and the battery has gotten to where it won't hold a charge any more without being in full sun most of the day.I decided to give it another go because I love the atomic time feature. The new one fills with moisture. I'll be looking for another brand. G-shock leaves a lot to be desired!!"
4,An Exceptional Purchase,"This Casio G-Shock watch exceeds my expectations. The time keeping is what you would expect as it is radio controlled. The time, day and date are easy to see. Recieving power from both direct and indirect light, outside and inside, is a great advantage. Keep the watch in it's power saving mode (which is set at the factory), but turn off the night light mode which turns on when your wrist is at a certain angle. That function will delete your power into nothing during the night. I would have given this watch five stars, except for the wrist band. It is a very good band, but it is difficult to find any place which can replace it when it it gives out. It would be best if these exact watches should be available in a standard, replaceable, wrist band."
5,Great watch at an unbelievable price!,My husband was so excited to get this watch because he gets sick of taking time out of his day to buy watch batteries! It does everything it promises!
2,Not Rugged By Any Means... Disappointed,I have owned G-Shocks for the past 13 years. This is my fourth watch. I found that with each new watch the quality of the product got worse and worse. This GW300 has been with me for the past 2 years. I love the watch but the back light is not working. So much for the solar panel... This will be my last G Shock. Disappointed.
5,Casio Gshocks,"As usual, these G-shocks will outlast your arm, excluding the battery...But dont think for a second that solar means without battery, it still uses one that needs to be replace, eventually. The Atomic feature is neat. I almost got radiation sickness, jk. It keeps time to the second.."
4,Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Tough Solar Watch,This is a great watch for the price. It keeps absolutely accurate time and appears to be sturdy and well-built. A bargain ... I love the time always being accurate due to the atomic function. I wish it had a better watch band.
4,Good but could be better.,"I've had this watch for about six months now. The pros for a watch of this type is solid construction and a strong band. It is also atomic and solar powered, two features that are very nice to have. The biggest negative by far is that pushing any of the buttons (excluding the backlight) is definitely a hassle. The only way I'm able to push the buttons is by using my fingernail. The buttons are too deeply sunk in the housing of the watch for anything else to work. Also, my watch has just recently been having trouble with the atomic timekeeping. For some reason it isn't updating anymore.If casio changed the design of the buttons I would absolutely recommend this watch, but the current design is annoying on a daily basis."
5,Casio Atomic Watch,"This watch is amazing. Re-chargeable solar battery, easy to read radio signal indicator, automatic illumination when I lift my arm to check the time at night!"
3,Only the size of the LCD on your digital camera!,"I got this for my husband for Christmas, and I didn't pay much attention to the dimensions as described on the website. It is a lot smaller than I was expecting, but that's my own fault! So you know what to expect,the screen on the Magpix is about the same size as the one on your digital camera. The pictures are also a little bit pixlated, so the quality isn't as high as I was hoping either. But the concept is good, and it will be nice to use this to show off pictures of the kids. There is this annoying bright blue light on the front of the album (I guess it indicates that it is on), that you'll find yourself covering with your thumb because it is so bright. You can set the album to show a slide show of your pictures or to look through them one by one."
1,Not ready for prime time,"It's a great concept, but my unit wasn't recognized by any of my 3 PC's, despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit. One of my PCs runs XP (they had no idea why this computer didn't recognize the Magpix) and the others run Win98 (which they said sometimes has problems with the Magpix, although they don't say that in their marketing literature). They gave me my money back, but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised, and in addition I wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them. I suggest waiting for the next version, or even better, for a better company to introduce a similar product."
4,Seeing Green............,"All and all this is a pretty cool case and well put together and holds quite a few discs for it's size. It seems quite durable and that is saying something to me...mainly because I tend to be rather hard on things. My only drawback on this badboy is that it wasn't quite the nuclear toxic green that it looks in the picture, but then again pictures can be decieving, oh well."
3,Errors of Fact Raise Questions,"The author has put together a complete order of battle and interesting information about the many formations and leaders that served with the 3d Army. Unfortunately, there are errors that call to question the accuracy of everything in the book. At least 2 and perhaps 3 pictures are completely misidentified as to the people included and their role in the war. The authors take on the Knutsford Incident is different than every other historian of note and contrary to what is known from Pattons own diaries. All-in-all readers should be highly suspect of some of the conclusions reached in the book and seek other views of Patton as well."
2,the 11th and last,"Pity the Mars books didn't have a definite ending and a single adventurer. I guess if Burroughs had known how popular it was going to be, he would have structured them more carefully. But oh well.There are eleven books in the series, and this one is the final book. Unlike the first, say, five books in the Barsoom series, ""John Carter of Mars"" is not so much a single book as it is an anthology of two long stories: ""John Carter and the Giant of Mars"" and ""Skeleton Men of Jupiter.""If you gotta have it, then you gotta have it. And you gotta have it if you want to complete your collection of all eleven.But both stories here are disappointing: the first one is for kids, and the second one leaves you hanging, since Burroughs intended to write a sequel. He never did.Sad to report, these have never been assembled into an omnibus edition, likeThe Complete Chronicles of Conan, or even a series of similar-looking tomes, such as was vouchsafed to E. E. ""Doc"" Smith'sTriplanetary (The Lensman)."
1,Sadly incomplete,"Let me start by saying I adore the John Carter of Mars books; I've read them many, many times over the years and I was really looking forward to being able to have the entire series on my Kindle. But I cannot in good conscience recommend this edition because the books included are incomplete -- when the edition was assembled, Disney appears to have dropped the forewords written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. These forewords are actually integral to the stories -- they tell how ERB received the manuscripts, whether from his uncle John Carter or from Jason Gridley (who was also in communication with Pellucidar -- most of Burroughs' series are very loosely set in the same world) and not including them means a loss of flavor and in some cases an abrupt and confusing beginning to the book as it appears in this edition.I highly recommend the John Carter books; I just recommend that you get them in an edition that preserves their original state."
1,Typos galore ....,"The unwritten agreement between customer and publisher is the customer forks over the $ and the publisher gives him a book that is readable. I doubt that there were 5 pages in a row that didn't have typos, misused words, etc. Just when I am getting into the story, bam, what was that word supposed to be? Reads like the book was retyped in a third world country and the editor was on vacation. I love Burroughs stories, but Simon and Shuster's pathetic offering is an insult to ERB."
5,Thirty years ago this book opened a new world to me.,"""A Princess of Mars"" began for me a journey which will last a lifetime. I lost myself as a youth and young adult, in first, the Martian series, then enumerable other Edgar Rice Borrough's tales. I have now begun the journey again with my 9 and 11 year old sons. The stories endure the test of time, impart lessons in life, and entertain in an unparalled fashion. Oh yes, Borrough's unique usage of descriptive vocabulary prompted my early fascination with the English language. Borrough's novels, and in particular the Martian series, has had a profound inpact on my life, and that of many of my family members. It is more entertainment than I had a right to expect, and I am thankful for the experience. Please read my favorite series chronicling the adventures of John Carter of Barsoom. You will not regret it."
2,Thoughts on John Carter of Mars,Don't bother reading John Carter Of Mars. It is not as good as the last book (#10 in the series) & talks down to the reader.
1,Rip-off,"This is Chrome Dreams ""The Unforgettable Journey"" very deceptively repackaged so that you cannot tell it is the same documentary. This is at least the third time I have bought this DVD repackaged in a manner that makes it impossible to identify until you open the packaging. This company are total rip-off artists. I am furious because I very carefully read everything I could of the description to try to determine if I had this already and you can't tell until you open the box and look at the non-label side of the disc or until you play it and what comes up on the screen is not Silver and Gold Productions but Chrome Dreams and the title comes up not as ""More in Sorrow Than in Anger"" but ""The Unforgettable Journey"". A blatantly deliberate deception to get people to buy the same product over and over."
2,Works until it begins leaking,"The Quarter Master 1/4-turn sillcock works very well, BUT. After a couple of seasons, it began leaking around the valve stem whenever the valve was on. It did not seem to be repairable and there was no information on the manufacturer's site about parts, repair or the 100% warranty mentioned on the product tag. At least one other reviewer on another vendor's site mentioned this problem as well.I like the 1/4-turn on-off feature, but will not buy this product in the future."
1,My book is not here yet.,Dear Sir or MadamMy book is not here yet.My book was sent to the right?Please could you help.Thanks.
5,Great,This Cd is one of a kind and I dont understand how come it hasnt made it to the charts in Australia. Its Good
4,IN SEARCH OF INSPIRATION,"After mining their created mythology of Americana on their first two releases and then confronting the reality of themselves on their third release, Cahoots captures The Band at a crossroads.Robertson's writing seems strained by the responsibilty of carrying the songwriting chores without much in the way of input from his bandmates.The result is the sound of band treading water waiting for the next wave of inspiration to appear.The bonus tracks on the re-mastered release add a spark of life to this album and are a welcome addition.I feel they would have elevated the original album had they been included initially.They certainly elevate this release from 3 stars to 4 stars."
3,Cahoots! A mixed Bunch!!,"A not too bad CD with a couple of real gems like Carnival and Masterepiece. Van Morrison adds a nice touch too. The Band had very much reached a creative cul de sac by the time of Cahoots, thankfully they turned it all around for the superb Northern Lights-Southern Cross. Still, even a burnt out weary effort by the truest of bands provides for interesting listening."
3,"Yes, It's Underrated. Yes it's their worst.","For the reviewer who questions whether this is the Band's most underrated album or its worst, the answer is both _ they were so good that even their worst is better than most artists' best. What drops this is the number of throwaway songs. But ""When I Paint My Masterpiece'' is wonderful and so is Richard Manuel's duet with the (psedonymous) Van Morrison. Manuel, who took his own life in 1986, is a tragic figure. If he had the ambition, he could have been a wonderful solo act."
3,Rick Sings His Heart Out,"If your a band fan already read on. If not I recommend starting with 'The Band' or 'Rock of Ages' albums first. It has been well documented that 'Cahoots' is supposedly a poor album compared with the others. While most of the tracks aren't exceptional, such as on 'The Band', this album contains two of the best Rick Danko sung Band songs of their collection. 'Where Do We Go From Here' is a well crafted song that is beautifully sung. The liner notes suggest that Robbie Robertson wishes The Band had taken this song further. If they had, it would have been phenomenal. The other song is 'Thinkin' Out Loud'. This track features Garth on piano and Richard on Drums. The arrangement is superb. The vocal blend on both tracks is reminiscent of their 'classic'sound. If you're a Band fan and haven't already got this album then I recommend you get it for these tracks alone. The rest of the album is o.k. but nothing to spectacular."
2,Apt cover art,"It is eery listening to this record in light of their better work--the voices are the same, the instrumental virtuosity evident if not on full display. It starts off well (Carnival, Masterpiece), then doesn't go anywhere. I guess the problem is the pretentious songwriting, which seems to have dampened everyone's enthusiasm for the project. The bonus tracks just highlight this: the Motown chestnut ""Don't Do It"", despite inferior sound quality, is now one of the best tracks. The cover painting says it all--5 wizened men standing somberly behind a crypt. Perfect depiction of the dreary music inside. Back photo is also on track, the five with their eyes closed--Levon's furrowed brow the tipoff. Is it only a rumor that one of the outtakes from the photo session has them holding their noses? Tip: their second lp, The Band, is a must have. Their first, Big Pink, plus one of the many best ofs, is all you need to round it out."
1,not what you ordered,"Be aware that many copies of the Cahoots cd are filled with ""Stage Fright"" and not Cahoots. I went to several retailers after buying and returning it. I don't know if that is the case with Amazon or not, but don't be surprised if it isn't what you wanted."
4,moon struck,"An alternate view on ""The Moon Struck One"": it's always been my favorite from this album and one of my all-time Band favs. I just don't get the heavy negatives for this song. I think it's one of the few post-""Big Pink"" cuts that digs as deeply into Delta mystery as ""Pink"" itself does. I get completely tranced by the dark, damp aura permeating the sound, and the lyrics are as real as it gets. Maybe it's because I grew up in Ozark country in the '40s-'50s, but whatever. I also go with ""River Hymn"" and ""Masterpiece"" as minor gems, but pass on the rest of it, especially ""4%."""
5,Cahoots by The Band,"It's The Band! What else is there to say about the music?The recording quality is pretty good. I played the CD then played the vinyl version and was hard pressed to tell a difference.If you are a Band fan (such as I), this is worth the investment to augment your music collection."
4,From what I've heard,"I've only had the opportunity to listen to part of this album, but I like what I've heard.I am among the ones that does not understand the sentiment against ""The Moon Struck One."" The song is written about and somewhat from the viewpoint of a little kid. ""He looked like he's really really hurt"" is exactly what a little girl would say. I find that the language evokes, not just a chronological place in time like ""Old Dixie,"" but a place in life, to which every person who has been a kid can relate. I like the words of the song, also. ""Sweetheart"" and ""cohort"" rhyming has always thrilled me.If ""Moon"" is the lowpoint of the album, I can hardly wait to hear the rest.I'll reserve the fifth star until I have heard the entire album."
4,"Who are these people, and why do they have such gorgeous homes?","(This is the same review I gave New Paris Interiors; I got both books and it applies equally to both, though all the homes and homeowners are different.)I'm going to love poring over this book over and over again. It's impossible to look through it all at once, anyway, it's so big and the visual onslaught is overwhelming. Being a middle-class, Great Plains middle-aged person, I will never see these apartments and rooms myself, but it's fun to see how world-class artists, musicians, actors, directors, designers and financiers like to decorate their homes. Some of them, I swear, are compulsive collectors - stuff *everywhere*! Most are beautiful rooms, lending lots of ideas or at least daydreams for one's own home.The photographs are lovely, often pieces of art in themselves. My only complaint is how huge the book is; it's not a lap-book, that's for sure. It is definitely worth the money, in my opinion."
5,LOVE this book!,"I just got this book in today and I haven't been able to stop looking at the photos! The book shows the homes of models, artists and fashion designers so there are quite a number of interior design styles represented. It's wonderful getting a glimpse into the apartments, mansions (and even a barge) of those who live in Paris."
2,a disappointment,"I am disappointed by this book; primarily because the home featured on the cover (the reason I boughtthe book) is NOT featured in the book itself. What a rip-off and misrepresentation. There are too manymasculine and minimalist spaces, in my opinion. Additionally, it is obvious that most, if not all, of thehomeowners featured decorated their homes themselves. Many are extremely cluttered or eccentric. I plan onreturning this book."
2,Distinct beany flavor,"Sorry to spoil the celebration, but for those not on a Gluten-free diet, this cake mix is sure to disappoint.As other reviewers have mentioned, the batter is truely revolting, useful perhaps for a practical joke or poisoning the neighbors. Unfortunately so much beaniness remains in the cooked item that the cake is not very palatable unless smothered with icing and icecream. The texture is also slightly on the chewy side, although this could easily reflect my own poor baking skills."
2,TASTES LIKE BEANS,"Like all bob's red mill mixes this tastes strongly of beans.The cake looked great and unlike most GF mixes this bag made a two layer cake, lovely, but the smell of the batter and the taste of the finished cake was AWFUL. We could not get past the bean-flavor. Very disappointing, I can not believe all the good reviews for this product!"
1,Most disgusting cake I've ever tasted!,"I made this cake as directed and it was absolutely disgusting. I bought this from Amazon.com so you can see that this is not someone who is just giving it a bad review with out honestly trying it. I have a household of five and not a single person could stomach this! That is including the teenagers my little brother ""dared"" to eat one of the cupcakes I made. After one bite everyone said similar things like gross..or what is wrong with this cupcake. Again I made it as directed and it was gross. I am really surprised since I liked the last gluten free cake mix I bought at the grocery store. If you really want to try this brand I suggest buying a single package instead of the 4 pack at amazon since you will likely have to throw out 3 bags. I usually don't take the time to write a review of something but that was how bad it was I felt I had to warn people."
2,Disappointed...,"I am a great fan of Bob's, but I have to say, was disappointed in this mix. I STRONGLY agree with others that stated it had an odd metallic taste. I could smell it as I mixing it, but hoped it would cook out. Unfortunately, it didn't. Couln't eat it. Had to toss it...AND wash the mixing bowl and pan twice to get rid of the taste/smell."
3,Disappointed,There was a hole in the bottom of one of the bags so the entire box was full of chocolate dust. Very frustrating.
5,The best cupcake I have ever had.,"This mix makes incredible cupcakes. They are moist, chocolatey, light, everything I want in a cupcake. I made them dairy-free as well, with rice milk and margarine, and they were great! I do not understand why people are saying they taste like beans. They do not at all taste like beans. I think they are better than non-gluten-free cupcakes - just the best! I used Duncan Hines classic chocolate and vanilla frostings with them, which are horribly unhealthy, but taste so good."
4,Much Better Than Some Other Gluten Free Cake Mix Out There,"I've tried a few other gluten free cake mix out there and this has to be the best so far. One bag is would make two 8"" round cakes, which is wonderful. The cake is not as spongie as the others. I was a little worried at first but it turned out to be a hit, my husband and kids loved it."
4,Chocolate Cake Balls a Decadent Gluten Free Dessert,"I made this cake mix, baked it, let it sit 10 min. and then crumbled it in a big bowl. Then I made Cherrybrook Kitchen Chocolate Frosting Mix (which is also Gluten Free) and mixed it together. Let it chill in the freezer and shaped with a melon-baller into small balls. Chilled again in the freezer. Then I put a toothpick in each ball and dipped the balls into Wax Orchards Classic Fudge (Fat Free, Fruit-Sweetened Dark Chocolate Sauce...also gluten free). Then I froze overnite. I served with fresh strawberries and pecans. It was awesome, so delicious, and everyone loved. No one would think this was gluten free. It could be dairy free too but I'm allergic to soy and didn't find a dairy free butter or margarine that didn't have soy so I used goat butter in the cake, butter and ghee in the frosting and rice milk in both."
3,It's OK,I recently find out that I'm allergic to wheat. So I need to make so many changes. The flavor is not the great is ok. I did try a different brand is the taste was great. with bob's chocolate cake mix. People didn't finish his their cup cake. But the other brand wooo. People didnt know is was gluten free. My sister in-law was are you going to eat that yes is gluten free. she said wow that test so good. I do purchases other item from Bob's Red Mill
1,Worst gluten-free cake I've ever tasted,"This brand usually has excellent products, but my experience with this cake mix was a disaster. I carefully followed the recipe, and ended up with something that was hardly edible at all - a very weird, metallic/burnt rubber taste (I also gave a try to their gluten-free baking mix, and the same thing happened. I had to throw everything away, no one could eat it).I wonder if the garbanzo flour could be what makes it taste so odd. In any case, I would strongly recommend to have a back-up cake if you are baking this one for a party."
5,Best ever!!,Best ever cake and brownie mix. My grandchild was so thrilled to have such a chocolatey taste.Not to much as to making it either.
3,"Nice texture, blah taste, leaking product","I received my box in good condition, no apparent mishandling or damage. Likewise, the inner product box was undamaged. When I opened the sealed product box, one of the bags was open and cake mix all over everything. Amazon was kind enough to reship the order and I'm waiting to see if there is any product leakage on the replacement order.I baked one package in a Bundt pan, adjusting the ingredients for our 9,200ft altitude. The texture was nice and moist. The taste, on the other hand, was bland and a bit odd. Certainly not what I would call rich or ""chocolatey."" I will try adding cocoa nibs or chocolate chips or cocoa the next time around."
5,Impeccable,"If you're going to own only one Nat King Cole record, this should be it. From his vocal phrasing, to his mastery of accomanying himself on the piano, to his vastly underappreciated soloing--I can't think of a better showcase of his talents on one record. The recording itself is also top-quality. Old-style small band swing record with great guest appearances by Sweets Edison, Stuff Smith, Willie Smith and Juan Tizol. Lester Young's brother Lee on drums swings his butt off. Many of his classics revamped, as well as rarer performances of lesser known songs. The previously unreleased version of ""Candy"" alone is worth the price. This is truly a desert island disc. Nothing sets a better mood."
2,David Lynch: Romantic Lead Extraordinnaire,"I'll cut to the chase. The movie as a whole is unappealing and boring, but it is memorable for David Lynch's performance. He plays the romantic interest for Isabella Rosselini. He plays a butler. He plays a man acting out a lie to curry favor with a woman. Did you know that David Lynch was this versatile an actor? His performance is sweetly sympathetic, a description that is not often attributed to Lynch, whose directorial efforts are notoriously off-kilter (though I personally find them hilariously in-tune with real life). If you enjoy Lynch, rent this movie just to see him in front of the camera. It is a joy."
1,"Pathetic, gut-wrenching pornography","Full of non-consensual sex, racist humor, and poor imitation German accents, this movie reaches for the bottom of the barrel. I have never seen such filth in my life. The only reason I give it one star is because of surprise cameo appearances by Garth Brooks, and the late Tupac Shakur."
2,"Mostly Bland, Garden Variety Soundtrack","When I first saw Final Wars one of the things that bothered me most was the music. Though it fitted the style of the movie by being fast paced and modern, it seemed very average, like a score written for some direct-to-video sci-fi flick. It is definate that fans will automatically compare this soundtrack to the work of Akira Ifukube, and that it is all around weaker than Akira's scores (only few of which appear in the film). Even people who have not seen other Godzilla movies and have nothing to compare the music to will find it fairly generic. Of course, there will be many who disagree with me, and if you are one of the many Final Wars fanboys then you will probably want to pick up this soundtrack. For the rest of you, it's not worth it."
2,One Big Flaw,"It's very good if you plan on storing CDs only. CD booklets are a few millimeters too wide for the sleeves, and bend and crinkle when you put them in."
2,Brommer's Splash and Daub Technique is as BORING AS WATCHING PAINT DRY!!,"Perhaps I was misleading myself, but the title suggested to me, dynamic ways to transition from painting on location to continuing the painting in the studio....or maybe the differences of the two....or at least something interesting! But unfortunately, this was merely a demonstration of artist Gerald Brommer applying paint (doesn't even say if paper is wet) and then using a tissue to remove a portion or what he applied....Not even brilliant color, just more and more earth tones and more earth tones!! Holy cow, how dull can it get?! And on top of it all, he doesn't do anything except a few finishing little strokes IN THE STUDIO...There's very little on this tape, for the beginner to intermediate watercolorist-absolutely nothing here for experienced painters.....Save your money and purchase an insightful Robert Wade tape!! In my opinion, only Tony Couch's tapes on Crystal Productions are worth the time it takes to view them!"
4,Ratso & Joe,"For a soundtrack a good collection of songs including one of my favorites ""Everbody's Talkin"". Worth it, also a great movie...."
4,Good souvenir !,"Good souvenir from the original motion picture but the best song (sung in two different ways) is ""Everybody's talking"", performed by Nilsson. These two versions are different from the studio version found in the current CD's of our singer."
3,"Good, but spotty in areas","I finally faced it; I know that the song ""Midnight Cowboy"" can reduce me to tears, make me want to curl up in a fetal position, but let's check out the rest of this. It's actually not bad. Most of the John Barry material is a loser, and ""Everybody's Talkin"" is a rather weak song that booted out Bob Dylan's ""Lay Lady Lay"" as that was the original song to be the highlight on here. The stuff from Garry Sherman, and Elephant's Memory are pretty choice cuts. I still have yet to watch the movie, so I will have to do that next."
1,Disappointing,The title showed up in iTunes in Chinese and the album sounded like it was dubbed using a cheap stereo and microphones.
3,Toots Thielemans Correction,"Though I agree with most of the previous reviews, I was disappointed to see (hear) that Toots Thielemans is not to be found on this recording. He is also not mentioned anywhere on the albums credits.He was used in the original score for the film, but according to his manager ""Toots"" was not included on this album.I would not have purchased this CD if I had known this in advance."
4,cool music,"its really got some cool songs. but i think you have to be pretty flexible with it. some of it is kinda weird, like ""jungle gym at the zoo"", this and one other song was the reason i didnt give it 5 stars. but the title song is really awesome, of course. so if your really into music its worth it. one of my favorite songs on it is ""he quit me"" its jazzy and the singer has a cool voice."
5,Cute and creative,I am an adult and have never read this book until it was assigend to me in a childrens literature class in college. The story is so cute a clever and fun and creative. The artwork is really detailed and the characters are straight forward and easy for the children to understand.
4,A Delightful Book,This a delightful book to read. The illustrations are spectacular. They allow children to view the actions and emotions of the characters that are displayed in the text. The moral of the story springs naturally from the story and is not didactic. What a wonderful book to share with children.
5,Fun Book!,This book was the perfect introduction to plants and their parts. My Kindergarten students loved the story and the pictures.
1,Book about rabbit tricking bear out of money!,"When I first started reading this book, I was impressed by the layout (book opens from top to bottom rather than side to side) and the illustration. But as I started reading the book, I became troubled by the message it was sending. Basically, a lazy, rich bear gets swindled time after time by a rabbit and his family. Ultimately, the rabbit gets away with his mischief and the moral is that its o.k. to trick the rich and lazy of the world. I got this book from a pack sold as an Editor's Choice from the Weekly Reader. Before you buy this book, go read it at the local library and if you feel the message is appropriate, by all means, read it to your children. I will never read this book to my child again."
1,Teach how to trick,This is a good book for teaching your child how to be dishonest and trick people. I do not recommend it.
4,Very enjoyable book.,"Tops & Bottoms is well written, and the illustrations are an adventure in themselves. There are some excellent lessons in the story, but the book will not hold the attention of my active 4 and 6 year-old boys. I'll have to wait for them to grow up a little before they can appreciate Tops & Bottoms."
3,I felt like I was there.,"Author John Gillett does a good job of describing the caves he's visited during his long caving career. When I read about his adventures, I felt like I was there right along with him.If there is a fault with this book it's that the cave visits end too quickly. There is a subtle, just-another-day-at-work-in-the-cave tone to the chapters. I know we can't all be Shakespeare, and Gillett does do a better job than most, but I just can't help feeling that this story is missing an element that could've made it a five-star book.On the whole though, it's a good read and I recommend it highly."
1,what a disappointment!,"I'm terribly disappointed by the bad quality of this edition. The booksize is really small (a5) and the pictures are even smaller. I really like the work of this artist, but the printing quality is terrible, which makes the pictures look ugly. really, they are much better on my computer screen than in this book. I can't figure out how is it possible to make such an unprofessional work, for such a price - I really feel cheated."
5,My favorite flavor,"I really like the ginger-flavored Altoids--they are by far my favorite flavor. They clean your breath and taste great. Sweet, but a little spicy as well. I recommend! It seems to be difficult to find this flavor in stores now, unfortunately. So I buy them from Amazon."
2,"strong, but not pleasant","I bought this hoping it would have the sparkle of fresh ginger, but it tastes only of powdered dried ginger & sugar. No depth of flavor or nuance.Some people may enjoy, but it's not my choice."
5,Great Product and Seller,"Great Seller and the shipment was exactly as stated. The ginger mints are definitely different and if you are a fan of ginger along with Altoids, I recommend this product."
5,"Great product, but $5 a can...get real!!!","Five starts for the product, one star for the price!I bit the bullet and paid the $5 to try these, and they are great, but come on, these should be sold for under $2 a can."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a real ginger fan, and I like most of the Altoids line, but these were a major disappointment. I agree with Mauserati below, no depth of flavor, a 'stale', flat, almost artificial note...not terrible, but I won't be buying them again. I really expected more from the Altoids brand."
2,Unusually Strong,"Even for Altoids, this flavor is unusually strong. I couldn't finish one. I will not be buying Ginger Alotids again."
4,Nollywood to its Best!!!,This was my very first Nigerian movie experience. I loved it!!! Its a great movie with a romantic touch. Its definitely a must see...
4,Good job.,The author did a good job organizing the information in this book.I would also recommend Surviving Financial Disasters by Tiffany R. Love which comes with a CD ROM and actual sample court documents from someone who has been there and done that.
2,Pat the Beastie,The item was described as in good cond. when it was actually in aceptable to poor cond.
3,Havent played online yet,This game is really fun but gets old fast. Havent played online. Sure it would be better.
5,great game,"Quote: ""1 out of 5 stars Pat kelly's review, November 26, 2004A Kid's ReviewI think if you are into paintball you wouldn't like it that much to me it is a waste of money. You would be better off playing.""ok, first off ive been playing a little over 3 years, I have a WGP Cocker w/ E-blade and 16"" dye boomstick. enough about my gun but yeh, Im extremly into paintball and this gives me something to do while im not playing, first off, it depends on how old you are, if your younger you might not like it, its the best paintball game made and extremly realistic except a few things. to sum it all up, if your into paintball, youll like it, if not then you might not want to get it."
1,Pat kelly's review,I think if you are into paintball you wouldn't like it that much to me it is a waste of money. You would be better off playing.
4,"A good game, but what other paintball game are you gonna get?","This game gives you the freedom to buy the parts you want to equip your character with. Play in many tournaments around the US and recruit teammates as you move on through the steps to being a champion paintballer.This game is great, especially for paintballers. I am kind of a paintballer, but not really, so any paintball fan would probably love this game. I like it a lot and im not that into paintball.Buy this game if you love paintball, rent it first if you dont."
1,not worth the money or the effort,"Coming from a man who has been playing paintball for 5 years, this game was a bitter disappointment. It was way to easy and there wasn't anywhere near as many accessories you would expect from a paintball game. Please don't waste your time or money on this product, borrow or rent first , and you will understand what I am saying."
5,Minty the girl,Minty was treated awful wiped to her bones. Most of us don't know how badly Minty was treated and this story will help you under stand Black history please read this book and you will know how i feel.
5,"Fun, Fast & Frivolous",Kay Capps-Cross has come up with a unique group of quilt patterns that will send you on the hunt for black and white fabrics. I have made two of her Slaphappy quilts in the past two months. This pattern is so easy and so much fun. If you hate tedious quilt patterns and matching every little corner then this is the pattern for you. Using black and white fabrics allows you to have a fool proof cooridanted color quilt with little effort. The results are gorgeous!
5,Me and My Daughter both Loved it!,"I got this for my daughter (10) for her and I to read together. We'd sit together and take turns reading it out loud. My daughter came home every day and asked if we could read ""our"" book together. We read it everytime we could find alone time until we were done with it. I liked it alot, but she LOVED it which was my hope. For the critics out there: This shouldn't be used IN PLACE OF but IN CONJUNCTION WITH talks about her body and what is starting to happen. I see a few critics thought there wasn't enough detailed information in it. I used it as a tool to start conversations about her body and upcoming changes, which is exactly what it did. It opened the door to talk in more detail about everything on her body from A-Z. It's not supposed to replace the conversations, it's supposed to help guide them. I would highly recommend this book to everyone that has a daughter that is getting close to beginning puberty."
5,Wonderful book,This book is perfect to give discussion on sensitive issues with a pre-teen girl. Totally recommend this to any parent of a young girl.
5,"Good, safe approach to puberty","I am a Christian and somewhat conservative when it comes to what I want my kids to know and when. I was really shocked at some of the info in some other ""coming of age"" books. This book tells them what they need to know- not all the gory adult details."
5,Great For Growing Girls,"My daughter is 7 and has been asking a lot of questions about her body. Though I think I've done a pretty good job of explaining things as best I can, this book was a great help. There are drawn and colored illustrations that you would expect from a children's book along with explanations and tips to follow. It was even helpful for adults as well. There is a section on healthy eating, bathing, puberty, menstration, etc. This book did a really good job of explaining the changes of a girls body leading up to puberty and adult hood without going into sexuality. I really liked being able to talk with my daughter about her body without having to get into the details of sex. I hope they have a book like this for when those questions start in.A very happy mom and daughter."
3,The Care and Keeping of You,"I'm 11 and I got this book maybe 3 weeks ago. I think it was a great book,but it didn't really tell me anything I didn't really know. I felt a little disapointed because I was interested in knowing a little bit more about my body. For girls who don't really know much, this is a good book to start on. It told the basic information. I really liked the book's other information though. For younger readers."
5,The body book!,"What a great book. I bought it for my 9.5 yr old stepdaughter who is starting to go through some body changes. She and I enjoy reading it together and answering her questions. It covers everything from keeping your hair, body and fingers clean to nutrition,the changing body, puberty, and Periods. I wish this book was around when I was going through puberty!!! It would have made life easier. Definatly a great book for kids over 8 years old."
5,Informitive and helpful,"This was a great book and it help me, actually, in many ways. I am a girl and I thought that I was ready for puberty even if it hit me on the head. Then I read this book and I realized I didn't know everything I could. I recommend this to any pre-teen like myself. It also helped me get my first bra. I didn't realize it, but I needed one. This book helped me to realize that. READ THIS BOOK!!!"
4,A Great Book for Moms and Their Pre-Adolescent Daughters,My daughter and I went through this book together. It's a great catalyst for talking about some of the more difficult topics facing young girls and the changes in their bodies.We held off on the latter chapters (about menstruation) until I felt she was mature enough to handle it.I wish I'd had something like this when I was her age!
4,Great for preteens,"I bought this for my 9 & 8 year old. I felt it was a little much for my girls as the book didn't leave very much to the imagination! lol No worries it got most of the basics down for them to understand that they need to care for their bodies. I was just a tad taken aback with the tampon insertion pictures but I understand for girls slightly older this needs to be seen... I would recommend for anyone needing to have a few ""talks"" with their girls."
4,"There are some awkward parts, but most necessary and facilitates conversation","Bought this for my 9 year old, and she quickly skipped to the good parts. I do think some of the information is too widely age ranged. Some of the stuff I thought was maybe a little over the top was:* Inserting a tampon (complete with drawings)* Eating disorders, while my daughter probably skipped this one, I thought that was probably a conversation for another book/dayAll in all thought I am pleased with this purchase, my daughter learned a few things and came back with questions/concerns that we could easily reference the book together and talk about and address. So, it makes the always awkward puberty conversation a little easier for everyone."
1,Gross,I thought it was nasty.Don't read it!Because I'm a boy!I looked at my sisters!So your business is now discovered!Ha!Ha!
1,A word of warning,"I bought it when I was 9, lead by the low age recommendation.For awhile I wanted such things as in this book to happen to me, but that quickly subsided, and I became terrified of such things, convinced they would happen to me THAT day.I don't worry about such things any more; wanting to be an actress saved meBut to parents - do you want your daughter's childhood to be spoiled with such?My advice; ignore this book; its horribly forward, does just what they claim not to - pushes you to grow up too fast. But if you must give it, wait untill she's at least 13."
5,The Care and Keeping of You,"A must read for 10+ girls entering the stages of immenient change! My daughter read it in 2 days, had really great questions that sparked great conversations. American Girl put out a quality read!"
5,great information book for any young girl,"This is a wonderful book for any ""pre teen"" girl. It has so much information that is presented in words that girls can understand. My daughter has read the book several times and come to me with questions. It is a great conversation starter if you have a hard time or uncomfortable explaining the changes their bodies are going thru. I would highly recommend it to any mother for their daughter!"
4,The Care and Keeping of You,"I really love this book. When my daughter was younger, and developing, I nearly panicked about how to help her to get through the various stages of her growth. I couldn't remember much about the order of things, and needed guidance. The Care and Keeping of You was tremendously helpful for me as a parent, so much so that as a therapist, and clinical supervisor of intern therapists, I have recommended this to parents and interns. Be forewarned, some of the illustrations are somewhat graphic, but really helpful. Hope that you enjoy this book as much as I have."
4,very informative ..,I wish I had a book like this when I was growing up ..it's clear and very easy to read ..the graphics are simple but effective ..
5,Very Good Book,Every girl should read this book.I am 11 and have read it. It tells girls things from acne to your period. Girls write to me! I need a pen pal!
5,Wonderful!,My daughter is eight and I'd noticed changes happening with her body! I knew it was time for me to have the talk with her about these changes but I just didn't know how to approach it! My girlfriend told me about this book she bought for her daughter and how it was wonderful! When I bought the book I reviewed it first. I thought it was perfect! Absolutley appropriate for an eight year old.When I gave it to my daughter she couldn't put the book down. She asked questions which was great (so I didn't have to initiate the conversations!) Overall I think it is a great introduction for a young girl to becoming familiar with her body and its care.
5,Every Teen-Age Girl Should Read This Book!,I love this book. I have read it and read it and read it! It covers everything that a Teen-Age of Pre-Teen girl needs to know about growing up and taking good care of yourself!
5,The PERFECT book to give your pre-teen daughter!!,"This book is a wonderful book to give to your pre-teen daughter. This book explains how their young bodies are changing into puberty. It touches on a variety of subjects such as hygiene, eating disorders, sports safety, your feelings, starting your period, ect. There are illustrations of a girl showing the proper way to insert a tampon. It gives a fantastic simple explanation as to why we have periods and what happens to our bodies. All the information in this book is in good taste and geared at instilling self confidence and good self esteem in our girls. (There is NO offensive sexual info) I gave my daughters this book when they were 10 years old and am so glad I did. I feel it opened a line of communication with my daughters that will build through the years. As parents, I feel it is important to be open and honest with our daughters about life and their bodies. This is the PERFECT book to start with!"
2,Not very informative,"I am 11 about to be 12 soon and I bought the book to learn a little bit more than about my body. The book was TERRIBLE. It talked about brushing your teeth and had cheesy lines like, ""Compare!,No fair!"" and quite a few other cheesy lines. I felt like an 8 year old reading it. If you are 11 or even 10 don't buy the book. It won't tell you anything besides things you already knew."
2,Too little info on female anatomy,"I skimmed this book and was not very impressed. It lacks information (review the statements by actual kids that were negative) It seems many people are afraid to give the basic facts, and so they buy a book like this that doesnt explain why their bodies get periods. When I was 9 and far from interest in sexual activity, my mother gave me the basics of how my female body works and the very basic mechanics of how babies are made...which if one is not made, a period comes about. A basic female anatomy book and some products in a nice green box which I kept under my bed for my reference. She didnt go into boyfriends, std's, oral or alternative life styles...none of that has to do with girls getting their periods. It has been difficult to find just the basic facts book...but this isnt it...still researching."
3,Good book for older girls,"I bought this book for my 10yo. Maybe I should have read more reviews on it because I think it's for older girls since it has a graphic display on ""how to use a tampon"". So I told her just to look at the content page and pick the sections that interest her. Other than that small issue it's a good book."
3,All good except.....,"I really like the way the topics were presented. It is non-threatening and informational. My only complaint is the information about Anorexia and Bulimia. I feel like that discussing mental heath disturbances is scary. They should have just discussed eating right and exercising (which was discussed). Adding this extra element was just unnecessary. I don't know about you, but I don't want my 8-year-old to know what bulimia and anorexia are."
2,For very young girls only,"This is an okay book for 7 & 8 years olds. It has very little real information about puberty and provides only a broad overview. If you want your girl to have detailed information about the changes her body will undergo, or information about changes in boys and social dangers (std's, unintended pregnancy, etc.), this book provides no information. It is a primary, introductory book at best."
5,A Good Introduction to Coming Changes,"This book was empowering for my daughter. She read it every evening for a week after she got it, and we talked about the parts that were a little confusing. She loved being able to talk like an expert on topics so important to her right now. (She is almost 10.) It doesn't provide information on more grown-up topics, so it's good for a young tween. The drawings on the cover may seem a little young, but they are less intimidating than photos might be, I think. An excellent resource."
4,The Care and Keeping of You,I have heard from other moms about The American Girl library and this book is a good choice for girls like my 10 yr. old daughter who are just starting to develop. It is simply put and we like to read it together so I can add my own personal comments and guidance. She also likes to read it in private and will then come to me with questions.
4,Very useful info,Good book to help talk to your child about the things she deals with/ will deal with everyday. Very easy for a child to relate to 9+
4,Great Introduction to Adolescence,"I was told by my daughter's 4th grade teacher that this would be a great book to introduce the dreaded menstral cycle, so I ordered this book and others by the same author. We were able to discuss the issue and then she could read and learn more. Some parts of the book are a little graphic and very explanatory. It is a bit embarrassing, but a good way to share those talks that you just have to have."
3,Needs a little tweaking...,"I don't understand why this book would state outright about ""being too embarrassed to talk to parents"" - I was looking for a guidebook for a girl to keep at hand, a supplement... as I want ME to be my daughter's main source for information. And so far she had trusted me with everything. Suddenly she is thinking she's ""supposed"" to be too ashamed to talk to me? Shame on American Girl for the alienating verbiage, when it should be nurturing the family connection too. (Or how about simply not putting the idea in childrens' minds that changes of life are embarrassing!?) We talk about changes matter of factly, like they are normal, and they are."
5,Right on time.....AGAIN!,"I purchased this book in 2000 for my then 9 year old (now 18 year old) daughter. The book was the answer to my prayers with how to broach many sensitive subjects with my daughter. NOW, I have another 10 year old daughter who had similar questions and we pulled the book off the shelf and blew the dust off....WAHOOOOO you did it again. I have recommended this book to all my friends with daughters who are between 8 and 14. FANTASTIC way to open conversation with mothers AND daughters, because as some reviewers have said, not all mothers are equipped to have such conversations with their children. I was one of them. Kudos!"
4,Right on target!!,I bought this book for my daughter who is 11. I also have another daughter who is 8 but I would only let her view certain parts of the book. I thought this book covered all aspects well of growing up and different changes that are taking place in your body.
5,Look no further...This is the one!!,"great book also bought ""Growing up its a Girl Thing"" ..the two together are good information presented well"
5,"Informative, Well-Rounded Book","I read this book when I was in middle school (I think I got it when I was about 11). I thought it was a very basic, helpful book about what to expect with puberty, and it definitely helped me feel less awkward when talking with my mom about the subject. It isn't incredibly scientific, but I felt that it provided plenty of information for any young woman to become knowledgeable about how her body works and how she can expect it to change in the coming years. It isn't filled with stick-thin images of young girls, it doesn't talk about sexuality, and its overall emphasis is on encouraging girls to be healthy and take care of themselves."
5,Great Conversation Starter,"This book is perfect to open the lines of communication between you and your daughter. We read it together and talk about that subject. She reads the book over and over and brings the book to me so she doesn't have to always say the words. She can just say ""can we talk about this page?"". The book presents all aspects of her body and the changes it is going through and will go through. GREAT BOOK!!!! I can't recommend it enough."
5,The care and keeping of you-a necessity for girls 8 and up,What a great book for girls to have at such an important stage in their life. This book answers questions for girls about lifes everyday issues while growing up. HIGHLY RECOMMENED.
5,It taught me well,"I read this book when I was 9 years old. For the record, I am 21 now and I am surprised that this book is still so popular. My mother was never the type to discuss things like this with me, so most of what I learned came from this book. I definitely did ask her some things as I got older, but for girls who are shy and might not want to talk (or for parents who feel the same way), this is perfect. It covers many topics, such as grooming, bathing, diet, exercise, breast development, and menstruation. It also touches on the importance of feeling comfortable and knowing that all girls go through these changes. The biggest reason I would recommend buying this book for your daughter is because it contains accurate information. There is a huge amount of inaccurate info passed around by kids (at least there was when I was in school), and it would be worthy to endorse and give this to the girl in your life."
5,Awesome Ice Breaker,"This book is great for starting the uncomfortable conversations you don't know how to start with girls. The ""PERIOD"" segment was right on time. The hardest of all to explain in detail without telling too much. I love it and I would buy it again."
3,Care and Keeping of You,"I've got to say, this book has some great information about keeping clean and eating healthy, however, I strongly recomend this book for girls under the age of 11. The period information in this book doesn't really help, and with half my friends, (including me) already have gotten their period by age 11 and 12, this book gives you almost no information. The other stuff is common sense. We know how to brush our teeth and brush our hair! Unless you're 9 or 10 (maybe 11?) don't bother with this book."
5,just what i wanted,Perfect book for a 9 yr old. Faced with the beginning of changes I decided to buy for my daughter. She really loves it and it doesn't focus too much on the menstrual cycle and instead focuses on total body care. Very age appropriate!
4,"The Care and Keeping of You, American Girl book for girls","This book is an easy-to-read, up-beat guide for girls entering puberty. My eight-year old read it with ease."
5,Excellent educational tool for girls,"My daughter's mom and I purchased this book years ago for our oldest daughter after it was recommended to us as she hit her preteen age. This book helped her become comfortable with talking about her body and the ""transformation"" it was going through. She learned that it is normal by all accounts. It also helped understand there will be more changes.This book has good drawings for girls to relate to. It explains things in good and easy to understand language.This book also helped me as a father talk with my youngest daughter. As expected she was more comfortable talking with her mom on ""girl"" subjects. After she read the book, I had a good long talk with her. I could immediately see her comfort level to discuss boys and girls increased.Parents, this is NOT a replacement for talking to your children. This is an aid to help them see in print that everything will be alright. Still have lengthy conversations with your child. This helps."
5,PERFECT!!!!,EXPLAINS THE CARE AND KEEPING OF YOU IN A WAY MY DAUGHTER CAN UNDERSTAND! I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY PARENT WITH A PRE ADOLESCENT DAUGHTER.
3,not for younger girls..unless!,"I read this to my 7 year old daughter. I just wanted to start realizing, her body will be changing in the next couple of years and what to expect. I think this book is very informative, except the actual pictures showing, how to put a tampon in her vag. area. I didn't think that was needed for my daughter."
5,The beginner instruction manual we all wish came with life.,"This is a great ice-breaker when your daughter is between 8 and 10. She needs to be mature enough to start discussing puberty with you and this will open the doors and get her asking questions and thinking about it. It doesn't go too far into the territory of things we're not quite ready to talk about, but instead it's really just a good foundation that every girl should have when entering the tween years."
5,Love it!,Love it! My daughter and I read a topic a night and she is enjoying learning how to care for herself and body.
5,GREAT SHAPE!!,"ONE DAY MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME WITH HER FRIENDS BOOK AND TOLD ME SHE WANTED ONE. SO I GOT RIGHT ON AMAZON.COM AND FOUND THIS BOOK FOR A LITTLE OF NOTHING. WHEN WE RECEIVED THIS BOOK, AND IT WAS IN A TIMELY MANNER, IT WAS IN GREAT CONDITION. IT PRACTICALLY LOOK BRAND NEW. SHE LOVES HER BOOK!!! THANK YOU!!"
4,Happy Mom,"This book is great. It teaches my 11 year old granddaughter everything about her body (the questions they ask, but we are unsure of how to answer). I had to buy a second book for my other granddaughter."
4,I really like it,"but now that I'm 12 I had to find another book and ask my mom for more stuff, because this book doesn't address sex AT ALL. It's okay for eight-year-olds, or younger if you develop earlier. It could have more info on stuff like anorexia, because I was sort of interested in that. It never said anything about boys, or lesbians, or how babies are made. Otherwise, it was good. They should make an older girls' one.I'm only 12 and at my school I've already kissed boys and my friend got drunk one time and they could have said more about this."
1,Nope,Okay there's some stuff in here worth reading but when you get to the picture of how to insert tampons I decided that it's not a book for my daughter at this age.Before handing this book over to your kid be certain that it's information that you want her to have.There's a lot of value in these discussions but at 9 my daughter is too young for some of what's in here.It is also a book that will assist you in your parenting. It should not be mistaken for a book you toss at your kid in lieu of a discussion.
3,Summary,"Yes, I did order this book for my grand daughter, and she is getting a lot out of it and enjoys it, will get a lot of good information, but if you are asking about my last shipment where you have sent out 2 of these books, then I am very unhappy as I did not order but only one book of this kind. Since this is going to a correctional facility I am in hopes of retriving it to be returned to you. I do not know how it happened, have never had this problem ever.Juanita Weber"
2,Strange Book...,"I bought ths book a number of years ago and flipped through it. I was around 9 at the time, and I didn't think it was particularly amazing or evil. But now, at age 12, I look back at it and realize that the book is badly proportioned, for lack of a better word. The information given is extremely basic (don't we all know how to brush our hair?), yet some of the sections are what I would consider pretty graphic. Cartoonic nudity? And on the back of the book it says ages 8 and up! Hah. Like I'd believe that. Do yourself and your girl a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Thanks Much,D"
4,"My daughter, Tryshna, love it!",I got this book for my daughter when she was 9 and she still read it for reference now that she's 11 1/2. I also got it for my 2 nieces and my godchild.
5,Every Girl Should Have This Book!,"I am 14 years old, and I still refer to this book every once and a while. I bought this book when I was around 11 out of sheer curiosity. It answered so many questions that I was too embarressed to ask my mom about. PARENTS: If you're looking for a book on puberty buy this!"
5,Bra's,This is EXCELLENT if you are a girl who needs a bra but doesn't know what to say. Or if you're a girl you just got her period but can't seem to bring it up. It tells all about the various styles and EVERYTHING.
5,Appropriate for preteens,"My daughter is 9 and I thought it to be an approprate time to start the ""talks"". This age group is still so innocent, it's hard for them to fully understand all that is coming up for them in just a few short years. The thing I like about this book is that kids can absorb information at their own pace and as they need it. What they're not ready for they won't read and when they are, they can look at it with some privacy (I've even heard her giggle about it with her friends).The book coveres a lot of self care like teeth brushing, showering, and the basics. The last part of this book is about menstruation and body hair. There is no sex talk like some other puberty books."
3,I need more information!,I like this book. The problem with this book is that when it starts talking about menstruation it doesn't give a lot of information about it. This is a good book if you want a simple or brief explanation about periods but a bad one if you're curious. I got this book when I was about 10 and I liked it but now that I'm 12 I need more info.I think this would be a good book for 9-11 year olds.
5,i love it,"I got this book when I was in fourth grade and my BFF got it too. We always brought it over to each other's houses and talked about it all night! We were so curious about our bodies because our parents never openly talked about periods and stuff. I am in high school now and it really helped me to understand how i should take care of my body and to understand what goes on. If you would like to help your daughter understand how her body works, I HANDS-DOWN recommend this book because it helped me."
4,helps get conversation started,"While I hope we have a few years for big changes, my 8 year old's body is changing in some ways. I like that this book has chapters that address nutrition, etc so you can just discuss what is relevant."
5,Great Reference Book for Girls,"I bought this for my step daughter (Eight years old) a few months ago. She reads it by herself and asks me questions about it in private. The information is factual without being intimidating. It is a great beginner's book to the changes that occur for a young girl, but it also covers basic hygiene information. It is also very easy for her to read. It's set up more like a picture book than an informational book. So far, it's been extremely helpful to her and has opened pandora's box of questions.This book presents the information in a pleasant and realistic way without being too vague or too graphic. Perfect for ages 7-9"
4,Great book,Great book for young girls. Easy to read and illustrations made it not so much like a text book. My daughter is 11.
4,great book for preteen-,This book is a great referrence book for girls in the beginning stages of puberty. It is so helpful withh the basics that a giirl has a hard tie asking a mother about. It can get the conversation started.
5,Great to start conversations,"Our girls like to read, so this is a great introduction to different topics. They read the book and ask questions when they come up. We haven't had ""the talk"" so to speak. Rather we have ongoing conversations that address their questions when they have questions."
2,Almost hate it,"the only reason I'm not returning this book is because it's not worth my time. I'm pretty sure I didn't order a water damaged, completely used book. I don't even like opening it, its that bad. I will not be purchasing from this seller again in the future. I was so excited to have some one on one time with my daughter and go through this book with her, but I'm so disappointed. It just puts a damper on the whole experience. Not sure what I'm going to do now. I'll probably wait until the newer version comes out in Feb and purchase that from a different seller of course."
3,very used,"I knew I was buying a used book, but I was very surprised to see it'd condition. The book seemed to be in very used condition and actually had some sort of sticky food on the cover. I was able to wipe it clean fairly easily, but wondered why the seller didn't take the time to do it.The content of the book is great tho. My 8 year old is easily understanding its teaching."
5,Very interesting and helpful,"This is a great book for pre-teens to learn about the changes that will or are happening in their bodies. It gave me very helpful tips and advice for keeping myself healthy. It covers everything you need to know about your body and how to take care of it. Examples are: Periods, breasts, and bras. I am 12 and just started wearing cup bras(my advice: start with a sport bra!)So order this book today! I recommend it for ages 10 and up."
5,Great book for girls,"I bought this book for my 9 year old daughter and it was very informative without being scary. It has age appropriate information, but doesn't dumb things down. My daughter loved it, and thanked me many times for buying it for her."
3,"Good info, but some graphic details included...","This is a good book filled with some great information. I purchased it intending to open up discussions about her body with my 8 year old daughter, who has had some of ""those"" questions lately. There is a lot of great stuff, HOWEVER, I was quite shocked when I discovered the picture (cartoon-ish, but still!) that explained how to insert a tampon. That is way more info than I want my 8 year old to have at this point. Good for older girls, or younger girls who are actually developing in that way, but not good for the younger girls who are just curious about what's next!"
3,Thanks for the ice breaker!,"Approaching the subject of puberty is always akward but this but definitely gave me a buffer from having to explain in detail some of the trials and tribulations of being a woman to my 10 year old. In fact, she said that several of her friends have the same book. So I guess I chose correctly. We haven't officially had ""the talk"" yet but at least I have something to refer to so its not so out of the blue. Thanks!"
5,L.O.V.E,This is a great book for girls from 9 and up. You will use it forever !!! It has how to take care of every part of your body. It vary easy read and it will help you gain cofadents about your self. I L.O.V.E this book.
5,excellent book!!!,i say this book is great.. My daughter is 8 yrs old and i didn't have a clue in the world on whether i should give her the talk or not.. the book helped me alot..And now she knows alot about her body and good hygiene!! i would strongly recommend this book to anyone with preteens.
2,Only Fair,Mickey Spalline plays a bit part. Great if you like the circus. Otherwise the plot is kind of thin.
2,Amateur Night at the Movies,"I enjoy Mickey Spillane the author..However, Spillane the actor is another animal. In Ring of Fear, Spillane attacks a role he can handle Mickey Spillane. However in Ring of Fire, Spillane should have stuck to writingThis Greatest Show on Earth wantabee takes place at the Clyde Beatty Circus. So if it takes place at the Beatty's circus, who else should play Clyde Beatty but Beatty him.Character actor Pat O'Brien and Sean McClory eat up the action and keep Beatty and Spillane from acting too much (thank Gawd). McClory shines thru in this part mof the Ring master with past. Beatty and Spillane know the orginal careers, howevere they seem wooden here in this WhodunitThis classic B was done by John Wayne Batjac company and presented in Widescreen format. There are NO EXTRAS oin this packageSo if want Amateur Night at the Movies, this is worth itBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
1,John Wayne's company (Batjac) hits bottom!,"Inarguably one of the worst films ever to issue from the celebrated Wayne-Fellows outlet--subsequently known as Batjac--wherein everybody seems to be ad-libbing their lines, and only Sean McCrory, as the nominal villain of the piece, bothers to give what might be called a real performance. Amazing, especially considering that the nominal director, James Edward Grant, once also directed an utterly charming film for Wayne, ""Angel and The Badman."" Actually, William A. Wellman, no less, lent an uncredited hand to this piece of tripe, but to no avail. One wonders if this project was a tax write-off. I can't imagine any other excuse for its existance! Skip it!"
2,Quixotic Circus Act,"The age of Cinemascope and the development of numerous widescreen formats and the possibilities of this wide canvas somehow skewed some filmmaker's vision and lured them to the obscure, outlandish and sensational interpretation of subject matter. This is a very strange film. With Mickey Spillane showing up to find the who's been sabotaging circus acts and Pat O'Brian literally walking in and out of frame through each of his scenes you just wonder what the producers were thinking. The one saving grace is Sean McClory's demented performance, which seems to mirror the filmmaker's interpretation of the widescreen format. This is one strange movie."
3,"Beautiful Film, Achingly Lacking","I enjoyed the film for any number of reasons: Liz Hurley is beautiful, Sean Penn and Sarah Polley are fun to watch, the scenery is keen, the sense of place is strong. And Liz Hurley is beautiful. Have I mentioned that? Anyway, this film has several good things going for it, and I would recommend it based on these things. The flaws of the film pertain to it's rigid desire to maintain a parallel structure in it's two separate (yet connected) stories. The one story feels very original and fresh (though come to find out it is roughly based on a tragedy some 100 years before). But the other feels forced into an attachment with the primary narrative. Evidence --and reason-- as to why these separate stories deserve to be entwined appears lacking. Separately the narratives are strong, it's just the mating of them that creates rough edges.Thank you.R.P. Petalver"
1,read the book instead,"This movie, the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it, is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime. The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious. Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures. Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint, read the book instead."
2,Elizabeth Hurley Topless,"This movie was hard to watch.......If it wasn't for Liz Hurley looking so tasty this movie would go straight into the scrap bin. Sean Penn is as good as ever but the movie just doesn't cut it. The most annoying thing was the back and forth......it just didn't sell it. If you are a Liz Hurley fan,this is a must see. She's the best thing since sliced bread."
5,"Penn is always brilliant, plus there's a bonus","Hey, the best reason to watch this movie is the ice cube scene with Elizabeth Hurley, this and this alone make this worth owning. That's all that needs to be said. Get some tissues ready."
1,Dry Mascara,"I love this mascara and I was looking for it everywhere. Finally I found it in amazon, it was very expensive because they don't produce it anymore, but I bought it any way. It arrived dried and I couldn't use it"
1,Not thrilled with this product,"Ever since Avon stopped making a Navy Blue mascara, I have been searching high and low for something other than brown or black, i have very light skin and blue eyes and the brown and black mascaras shadow my eyes it looks like i have dark circles under my eyes. So as I continue to search for a decent priced Navy blue mascara I come across this and from the reviews I thought I would be getting a good product, but I didn't, this product barely even coats the lashes, where is the mascara? I don't like thick globs, but this even with trying to put on 2-3 coats of it still looks like you are wearing no mascara. Not to mention that it does not even look navy blue in the sun. The only thing this product is good for is to put on TOP of the bright blue mascaras that I have bought thinking they were going to be navy! So that is the light at the end of the tunnel, the mascara will get used because I need cover up the bright blue to tone it down."
3,Intriguing until the politics,"This is the first Laura Lippman novel that I have read and for the most part enjoyed the book. I enjoyed the Baltimore feel and the main character Tess Monaghan. I was engaged by the story line and I thought the pacing was OK.In fact the book was such a good read that I was able to gloss over the Snoop Sister Instant Messaging/Chat Room as an almost a too convenient dispenser of assistance and clues.However, towards the end of the book, Lippman uses the main character to wax political on the state of social services, the insensitivity of the administration, and the soullessness of anyone who does not support a nanny state. I found this tedious and distracting -- though I realize other readers may find it worth cheering about. I prefer to keep my crime mysteries free of preaching."
2,Not worth the money,By a Spider's Thread was not as suspenseful as I would've hoped for. I found the book to be very formulated and almost a soap opera story line.The story line was weak and predictable. My favorite part of the book was the Snoop Sisters. I did not have the feeling in the last 100 pages that there was no way the story could wrap up w/in that page timing and the urge to shut out my household so I could finish. I did find myself hunting through my bookshelves wondering what I could read next that would blow me away. I dreaded having to finish this book because I felt it was taking my time away from a better read.On the flip side I did learn a lot about Orthodox Jews.I am curious about here early works; being that this is the second book she's written alone. I'm in no rush.
3,Gone missing,"PI Tess Monaghan has recently recovered from a traumatizing brush with death, and her bank account needs some replenishing. She accepts a request from Baltimore furrier to locate his wife, who has vanished, taking their children with her. He's broken hearted, and is willing to think only the best of his young wife, even though he knows all about her family's lurid history. Within a few days, Tess uncovers facts that explain the truth of Natalie's disappearance.By a Spider's Thread is a fairly routine crime novel. Tess is a feisty character, and her client's obvious devotion to his religion and his family impels her to wrestle with her own fear of intimacy and her ignorance of the Jewish half of her own heritage. It's an interesting story, but to read author Lippman at her best, check out her stand alone novel, Every Secret Thing."
3,Vat in the Vorld Vas She Thinking?,"People seem to love this author--and I rather liked Every Secret Thing myself--but I had to force myself to finish this one. The title has nothing to do with the book, for starters; the humor is all facetiousness--there's rarely anything genuinely funny about it; the plot is tediously predictable; and finally, in the penultimate chapter, one of the characters--suddenly and inexplicably bereft of a thick accent--explains the whole silly shebang to another character (who already very well knows everything) strictly for the readers' benefit in a bit of bad dialogue and plotting laziness that almost made me throw the book across the room. I'm sure I'll give Ms. Lippman another chance someday--she is, I think, much better than this--but here she is just phoning it in. Three stars for Isaac and the Jewish uncle ONLY."
3,"Hard to put down, but","This was my second Laura Lippman book. I found it very compelling at the start, but it seemed to bog down as it went on. There were several red herrings, but I was completely suprised by the turn of events. The ending wasn't what I expected.I loved ""Another Thing to Fall"", but was disappointed with this book."
2,Dull and slow,"There's a distinct lack of energy in this novel, no sense of urgency or energy. Also, I found the excessive references and asides regarding the main character's and other characters' religion to be very annoying. I'd say the same thing if we had to read constant references if the characters were Mormon, Catholic, or anything else. This adds nothing to the story and just adds more details which take away from the plot."
2,Not very interseting,"I thought the book would be much better than it was, It just seemed to fall short of any real excitment.I would not reccomend this book to my freinds."
2,"Great actor, Good movie, Bad transfer","Feeling a little nostalgic for the movies I grew up with back in the USSR, I bought Le Professionel DVD from Amazon. I was looking so much forward to see this action movie and Belmondo whose movies I used to watch dozens of times in my childhood. What a frustration!!! Very bad PAL->NTSC conversion (many visible artifacts), extremely bad video transfer/encoding on DVD disc (blurry image), all audio tracks are mono, moreover they are poorly recorded which does not do justice to the famous Morricone theme. As much as I love the actor and the movie I do not recommend buying it. Shame on Image Entertainment for such a horrid DVD release."
3,BELMONDO GETS REVENGE,"""LE PROFESSIONNEL"" from 1981 is at heart a comic book plotted B movie that's still a fun ride. Here Belmondo is French spy Joss Baumont sent to assassinate an ruthlessly cruel African dictator. But when the powers that be change, he's double-crossed by his own people and sent to hard labor at a bad, bad prison camp. But not to worry, 'cause no prison can hold Belmondo and nothing will stop him from his assassination assignment, even if he has to pick a new target. Cool chicks, hard guys, fast cars and a score by Ennio Morricone. What's not to like?"
3,Takes you back in time,"You simply have to prepare yourself. This is like a 70's spy version of a spaghetti western.It's not bad. It's not really that good. Complete with overacting and almost comical fight scenes, yet the plot is actually pretty good and the ending....Mr. Macho Professional doesn't fail to annoy you at the ending where you can seea totally different ending happening."
3,Curiosity piece.,"I'd love to have been able to rent this title as it is certainly worth a look for anyone who is interested in movies from this rather odd genre. Violent French action flick with a fairly short, classic style car chase(no CGI)in Paris. The movie does have a look and style that you won't see anywhere else...... but the purchase price is a bit much for a film that you will probably only look at once or twice in your lifetime.Not one of the greats even in it's day .... but if you're a collector it might be worth your attention."
4,Sociocultural Materialism Rules,"The title to this book is somewhat misleading. It is not about the Industrial Revolution as recounted in the history texts, but about the IR that is transforming America today. This book examines the costs of hyper-industrialism on such institutions as family, community, political campaigning, agriculture and higher education. It really brings social theory alive."
2,"Made in USA- great! Actual quality, so-so.","In some ways I'm very impressed by these little CD racks. the leading one being the packaging I got said made in USA. I was astounded by this. I did not think we made anything here anymore, and for that reason alone I'm keeping these racks. However the actual quality of them is nothing to be impressed with. As other reviewers say, they are quite flimsy and will warp if you try to stack them, plus the stacking grooves do not lock in place, which is not good. I do like the slots for 2 disc collections, but honestly I picked upDomino 45 CD or 21 DVD Media Storagethis rack by Atlantic at my local K-Mart, and though it is made in China, it is made of much sturdier, nicer plastic and will lock into place when stacked. Now don't get me wrong, I'm for buying American whenever possible, but when the quality truly isn't there, it just doesn't add up. I really wish I couldn't reach that conclusion,but there you go."
2,It should read 22 Capacity CD Plastic Storage,"There are gaps above and below in the box which limit the capacity to 22 total individual CDs. If you have 4 double CD carriers, then you can maximize the capacity to 30. Otherwise, it looks silly. I was rather disappointed especially because for a dollar more I could have had a different 30 CD storage cube which I liked better."
5,Just what I was looking for!!,I'm not sure what people are complaining about. These cd storages are great! I have 18 of them. These are small in size and hold 30 cd's. I have a huge cd collection and these make it easy for me to store my cd's. Don't be fooled by the complainers. These are great.
4,good enough for what it is,"As previous reviewers have noted, this storage rack is not as heavily-built as some other racks from the heyday of CDs. However, it is a cheap way to organize the CDs cluttering your bookshelf. Now, if only this manufacturer would get back to basics and once again start making the big, simple 180+ CD capacity racks that one used to be able to buy everywhere."
4,Even cuter in person,"I recently bought the pewter version. It's a nice subtle shine, not too bright. They're even cuter in person, and very comfortable."
2,Davies does not lives up to his promise.,"Davies promises that the last 3 minutes are as important as the first 3 minutes, a la Hawking et alia. He does not support that statement in this small book. Most of Davies series is far better than this book. He should have left the topic alone."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I never really read foxtrot before, and my parents got it for me on my 13th Birthday. I did'nt know why got it for me, because I never talked about liking it. But I read it, AND I LOVE IT! It is now one of my faverite comic stips EVER!This Book is great, it is extremely funny. This book is two foxtrot books in one. It includes foxtrot books ""Come Closer Roger There's a Mosquito on Your Nose"", and ""Welcome to Jasorassic Park"". I think it is great. You should definetly buy it."
3,not as bright as implied by the photo,"Of course you only get one tower, and you manually switch the colors with buttons. That's fairly described in the Product Features.And it's not bad looking to my eye, and the light is pleasant.But it's not nearly as bright as I expected. I believe the product photos were ""creatively"" shot. In a completely dark room, this is not much brighter than a night light. You'd be hard-pressed to read by it for more than a couple minutes, with all 3 LEDs on and the book right next to it.I didn't buy it as a reading lamp, nor to illuminate a whole room, but I was expecting more lumens -- perhaps reading too much into the phrase ""high performance LEDs"".I'd expect a newer version of this with newer (hence brighter) LEDs would solve the problem. Or if the mfr would simply put in 3 LEDs for every one in the current product.Still, this might be what you're looking for: it is a pleasant (albeit large) desktop/tabletop night-light."
3,Loved the Cover!,"I am an enthusiast for the naval-air actions in World War II, and own some 700 books on the subject. I wanted to include this one, if nothing else for the lovely cover illustration. Osprey Publications deserve high praise for their layout, readability, and illustrations.This is definitely a ""beginner's"" book, and just touches lightly on its subject. I enjoyed it, but as an ""expert"" already in the field, I found it covered a lot of ground on the subject but offered little new."
2,It is hard to squeeze!,"I'm a 33 yr old woman with a strong grip. I bought this to pick up chip wrappers and plastic bags that blow into my yard, icky stuff I just don't want to touch with my bare hands. It does work for that, but the grip is quite hard to squeeze and it is difficult to keep the jaws closed. Someone who has a weak grip would have a problem using this and managing it effectively.It is light in weight, as described,but it is not as effective as other models I have seen ."
