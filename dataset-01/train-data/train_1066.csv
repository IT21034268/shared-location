5,Wow,"I got one of these for Christmas last year and was so impressed that I bought two for family members this Christmas. Your teeth feel like you've just had them professionally cleaned, and the brush heads last a long time."
5,Awesome product,"This is such a cute little toothbrush, and it does exactly what it says. Very nice charger, stays charged for a LONG time. Very happy with the product!!!!"
4,Philips Sonicare,I love the way it makes my teeth feel so much cleaner than ordinary tooth brushes. It is important to me to take great care of my teeth. They are the only ones I have. The Philips Sonicare makes it easy.
5,toothbrush,"I was very pleased with the Phillips toothbrush! A little intense the first brushing. Had my mouth all tingling..can""t imagine using a regular toothbrush now."
5,"Works great, keeps my teeth clean.","It works great, and keeps my teeth clean. I don't really have anything else to say other then that. Good price. :-)"
3,No replaceable batteries,"The toothbrush works well, as everyone has said. My only complaint, after having to replace my old Sonicare after 5 years of use, is that the batteries are not replaceable. It seems like a big waste (both financial and environmental) to spend another $50 to replace the entire toothbrush when all it needs is a new battery."
2,disappointing,"I've been using the product for less than a year. I bought it to replace a very old model. It has started to malfunction; it won't hold a charge, so I'm very disappointed.The previous product had a 30-second timer to tell you when to move to a new group of tooth surfaces; this product did not have that feature; I was disappointed."
5,Amazing!,I love this thing! This thing is amazing! I will never use a another brand of an electric toothbrush! I will never use a regular toothbrush again! Love it!
5,So good,"I love it. Very good deal!Totally different from other brand's product, like oral-b.It is way strongger, and I like the 2 minutes program, so I know everyday I brushed my teeth enough time."
2,Lasted only 3 months,"When it worked (for 3 months), it worked fine for the entry level, reasonably priced toothbrush that it is. Used it one yesterday and it worked fine. Today it is dead and will not take a charge. I don't think it's unrealistic to expect a product like this to last more than 3 months. Very disappointed. If I want it made right, it involves shipping back to manufacturer and waiting for replacement. Not worth my time and trouble, but maybe they count on that."
1,Don't buy. ..lasts less than a year,The first Philips Sonicare was given to me 10 years ago for my birthday & it lasted for 8 years. Apparently due to enviromental concerns the previous generation used a different battery that lasted forever. Now the newer ones use a more enviromentally safe battery. .. only thing is the newer Sonicare only lasts a year! I dont know about you but I am not spending $60.00 a year on a toothbrush. It would not be bad if you could replace the battery & you can if you have a workshop with solder gun. I ended up buying a Braun Oral B & you get four replacement brushes for the price of one Philips brush. The Oral B also has a bottom compartment that can be unscrewed probably to change out the battery. Anyway I'm not gonna miss buying expensive Sonicare toothbrush replacements thats for sure.
3,Sonic toothbrush,I have had three. So far this toothbrush is working. I am disappointed in these toothbrush because they do not last more than 3 years. The item was delivered in good time and was as advertised. I just wish the battery would last longer.
5,Philips Sonicare,"Great product except if you want to keep it really clean you need to untwist the head to rinse all the toothpaste off. Everything else [timing, pressure, battery life] is great."
1,"no quad timer, lasted 3 weeks","I bought this as my 4th Sonicare and was totally disappointed. It stopped working completely after 3 weeks and since it never occurred to me to keep the packaging, I'm out my money. Unlike all my previous Sonicares, it has no quad timer which I absolutely loved. So maybe I'm glad it died."
5,Sonicare 5300 electric toothbrush,"I had previously gone through 3 Oral B toothbrushes that lasted about 2 years each. A friend told me she has been using a Soniare for 5 years and it was still going strong. I ordered the #5300 which was perfect, like moving up from an Edsel to a BMW. Fast delivery too. Highly recommend both Amazon and the Sonicare #5300."
4,Monies well spend!,"So far my teeth look whiter, just like I let the dentist's chair. My main reason for purchasing the Sonicare power toothbrush, remove plague off those hard to reach teeth."
5,Happpy Purchaser,Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush: This was a very worthwhile purchase. Am very pleased and would recommend to others. Very satisfied with Amazon product and service and will be back for more.
1,Faulty,"I have had a Sonicare toothbrush for 12 years. Justrecently, it does not hold its charge. Therefore, I purchased the Philips Soncare Essence Power Toothbrush and found it just does not hold up to my old one. After use, I rinse and clean the toothbrush, drying it with a soft towel and set in its charger. It leaks water and I'm not sure where it's coming from. I shake the brush part to get all the water off and there is still water in the handle, or coming from somewhere. It is very cheaply made and I will NEVER purchased another one."
4,Spend the extra money,"I love all of the SonicCare electric toothbrushes. I've used several and my teeth are noticably brighter with regular use. They also give you a deeper clean feeling. I would never switch back to a regular toothbrush. I prefer the elite SonicCare line over the regular one, which I just purchased. It has more options (a gentle power setting), beeps at 30sec intervals, etc. The brush here still turns off after 2 min which I think is really important if you don't have a timer in your bathroom.I'd def recommend this product but I'd say spend the extra $10 and get one of the more advanced ones. Also, if it's your first time, be sure to separate the head and the body and use the stand they provide for the brush head, rather than keeping it on the charger. It allows liquid inside the brush to dry rather than mold, and even though it's not at all possible that it can reach your mouth, the insides are rather hard to clean when this happens."
5,TRY IT ...YOU WILL REALLY LIKE IT BETTER THAN THAT OTHER FAMOUS NAME BRAND TOOTHBRUSH,I have purchased the Sonicare Essence 5300 and I AM SO HAPPY WITH IT. I had used two previous models of [...] electric toothbrushes but was not really happy with them. I purchased the Sonicare Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush because of the reviewers. Almost of all of my purchases from Amazon.com was because of the reviewers and their opinions of the products they have purchased. I love the speed of this toothbrush and the toothbrush bristles. I feel that the other toothbrush heads of the other brands were not as soft as this toothbrush head. Thank you Sonicare! It is true that after brushing with Sonicare your mouth does feel like you just came from the dentist office!!!!!
1,One big problem,"I recently bought 2 Sonicare Essences, one after the other. In both of them the switch broke. The first one worked intermitantly after about a month; eventually it quit totally. I really liked the way it cleaned my teeth so I replaced it with another. Within a month number two wouldn't turn off! Fool me twice, shame on me! I now own an Oral-B electric toothbrush; same clean teeth but with a switch that actually works."
3,Sonicare,THe last Sonicare I had still works. It had 30 second timers on it so that I could brush each quarter of my mouth for 30 seconds. However they [unfortunately] discontinued making the replacement brushes available so I had to buy a new one that does not have all of the features of the old one. I lke Sonicare products but am unhappy with my experience.
5,Sonicare,"Excellent product works very well and the price was great, it was quickly dispatched and arrived in no time. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush."
4,Plastic packaging overkill,"I really like Sonicare toothbrushes, but my one complaint is that the toothbrush (and case and charger etc.) came in a huge hard plastic container that took 10 minutes to open and nearly cut open my hand with the sharp plastic edges.The toothbrush is great and I would have rated this 5 starts if they had used cardboard packing materials, which are easier to open & discard, and use renewable resources."
1,Don't Buy,"Don't buy this toothbrush. Water gets caught in handle and drips all over your clothes when you brush your teeth. Also, it must be cleaned after every use or it grows mold. Customer Service says you are supposed to take it apart after every use and let it air dry to avoid these problems. Too much work for this brush. Shop around."
4,Sonicare TB,good product very powerful and cleans well. Will recommend to others. The review process is obnoxious withe the word count minimum of 20.
3,Caution needed when using,"When I first got my Sonicare I was so excited to begin using it. My dentist had strongly recommended my buying an electric toothcare device. I most of all wanted to save my teeth and gums, so I set it up the first night, loaded toothpaste on it, inserted the toothbrush end and turned it on (so good the instructions stated the importance of putting the brush in your mouth before turning it on or toothpaste would have splattered all over the mirror). Immediately, my entire mouth vibrated unpleasantly, and it felt like my teeth were being drilled. It felt like pain was imminent. I've practiced numerous times since, and the fear has lessened--somewhat, but I confess that first experience was so unsettling that it set the pace and I look for excuses to go back to my manual toothbrush (it's too late, I'm tired, the Sonicare brush head is too small to really do much good, and thoughts like that)."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Think this would be a nice first electric brush for a child. My first Sonicare was a winner, it just woreout. Being a senior citizen now, totally dependent on social security with too much month left at the end of the money, I ""thought"" I should order this cheaper model. Big Mistake. Should have bit the bullet and splurged on a better model; even the next price up should have been better than this one. If I had neverhad a Sonicare to have been able to compare the two, I might have been satisfied, but doubt it.Regret not being able to return it for a trade; but pretty sure you can't return a toothbrush. Even thought about suggesting I take the head off and try to exchange the base; but who would you write to?Trust me - if you're an adult about to order a Sonicare for the first time, don't get this one."
1,Another Not Made in the US ...my Bad...,"Why do I keep going against my own impulses..? But then it is impossible to find some items that are stillmade in this country. The noise of this brush in my mouth was enough to drive me up a wall!!!!!! Tinny, highpitched and so bad that I turned it off.... tried it again a few hours later, and it was really as bad as the firsttime.Please America... let's get back to making the things we use every day! It is no longer a bargain when weare poisoned in more ways than one by outsourcing."
3,Good Toothbrush,"I have been used this toothbrush for almost 3 weeks. My teeth didn't change much. I hope this will make my teeth look whiter, obviously, it doesn't."
3,Has some flaws,"While this is a generally solid product the charging station is not stable enough and can be pretty easily tipped over. however, as a toothbrush, once you get used to it ( a week or so) you'll like and it certainly helps strengthen your gums. Just be aware, that it can get your attention and put you on your tippy toes as the feeling in your mouth is different."
2,Lasted 15 months - Now I'm shopping Oral B,"After 15 months, I am having trouble with the power button. There seems to be a random short in it. Some days it works; some days it won't turn on. This product came highly recommenced by my daughter, so I decided to upgrade from my inexpensive Oral B. It took me a long time to warm up to this toothbrush. I found the brush head too small, and didn't see value in the Sonic action over the rotary action. I wouldn't buy this product again, and am now shopping for a higher-end Oral B."
1,"awful battery life, waste of landfill space",For the tooth-cleaning capacity I would give this 5 stars. But I am REALLY offended by the inability to change the battery. I am now on my 4th handle in 2 years. The battery lasts no more than 6 months and then stops holding a charge. So the entire handle has to be discarded for what looks like a rechargeable AA battery inside. Phillips- what a waste of landfill! They make us throw out the whole thing for that?!? Phillips should be ashamed to have such an ecologically unfriendly package. Phooey.
2,lost battery power after 18 months,The first Sonicare from Walgreens lasted over 5 years. This one lost recharge capability after 18 months. I'm going back to Walgreens.
4,Sonicare tooth brush,"I like the product, I do not see any reason to buy one of the more expensive models. For what I wanted this model works great. I would buy it again."
5,really helped my teeth and gums,"Went to the dentist after skipping a couple of years and had a pretty bad checkup. Was sold one of these on the spot. Wouldn't normally get something like this but I was desperate.The dentist I go to measures your gums in millimeters. Was in a borderline state when I got this, but after using it daily along with daily flossing, I was able to get my gums back to where they should be, which is 2-3mm (I think). Pretty amazing improvement and I'm glad I got to this before it was too late.This is a lot more fun and also less expensive than dentist visits, so I highly recommend it for that reason! Plus, you'll have a great smile. Really makes my teeth look great."
5,Recommended by my dentist,"This product was recommended by my dentist for gum line cleaning. It has worked well so far, but hard getting used to the vibrating bristles."
4,Toothbrush works well,Product is very good. Purchased this one as a replacement for the same thing. The first one failed after about 4 years. Dentist recommends this unit. Price is better than most retailers.
1,Died in storage,"Five stars for the charger (works with my old sonic); 0 stars for the toothbrush because it won't charge.Actually, I just needed a charger for my old sonic toothbrush, maybe 5 years old now or perhaps older. I bought this thinking I'll have the charger and use the new toothbrush when my old one dies. Wrong. My old sonic is still working fine. But when I tried to charge my ""new one"" I found it died just sitting in storage! Never used. Past warranty.And CW recommends completely discharging the battery as key to longer life, better performance and it's been completely discharged in storage. It worked on arrival (just charged and tested, never used). It was charged a second time, by the wife, maybe a year latter, in error. And that's it. It will not longer take a charge. So, maybe the quality is no longer there."
3,sonic care,This is my second sonic care. The first one died after two years so I guess that is their expected life. It works o.k. but it turns off before the two minute cycle and I am forced to turn it back on. My teeth are cleaner but I still feel some leftover plaque that the brush misses.
5,sonicare essence,"bought two for the kids. they love them. pricey replacement parts though. Does a great job in oral care. really makes a difference in gum condition, whiter teeth etc."
4,Great!,I bought it for my husband. He loves it! The traveler case is very convenient! I highly recommend it!
2,3 Reasons I Recommend Considering an Alternative,"1) Head shape is not circular like other toothbrushes, and is not as effective.2) You must use Philips Sonicare head replacements which will ultimately cost you $40+ a year.3) Design flaws will lead the product to get dirty easily under the head.I would recommend the Oral B Professional toothbrushes instead :)!"
1,"Works great, until it doesn't...","Santa brought me a Sonicare this past Christmas.Didn't get around to trying it until a month later. Wish I'd got one years ago!Used with some clover compound (silica based toothpaste) really shined up my 50 year old choppers....But now it's May, and the brush only holds charge for five or six brushings, then it's dead.No idea what model since I didn't save the wrapper.Phillips is so proud of their product they didn't see fit to put a model number or any identification on it. It looks like the one in the Hx5351 picture but doesn't have all the cack pictured with it, other than the charger.Anyway, I'd have given it five stars a month ago. Now, with battery life that won't even last a long weekend, I can't see giving it any stars..."
1,stops after 20 seconds.,"I bought this after careful research, it was great at first, then after about a month it wouldn't stay on passed 20 seconds. I don't know what I can do about it, I don't have the paperwork.. so I guess I'm stuck, but you don't have to be."
3,Great if you get one that works,"The first one I bought about a year ago is great- the batteries last for two weeks, lots of brushing enthusiasm. Definitely a 5-star experience, in line with the other positive comments.Then I bought a second one for a second home. The charge only lasted a day, if that, so I returned it. The replacement is better... the battery lasts maybe 4-5 brushings, then dies without warning. If this was my only experience, it would get 1-2 stars. Maybe I just got two out of the same bad batch.Amazon has been great about returns, but it's kinda annoying to have two instances of a product fail like this."
4,Good toothbrush for the money.,"My brother has used his Sonicare brush for years now and swears by it. So I decided to find one for myself. I got the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush during December while it was on sale and have been using it for about a month now. I am a regular coffee, tea, and colored soda drinker. I was hoping that it would remove some stains, as promised, but I have not noticed a change. Other than that, it is a solid toothbrush, it feels nice and sturdy while brushing. And is easy to remove the brush head for cleaning. It isn't too harsh on my gums or teeth. Overall, I like it and will continue to use it."
5,Perfect but expensive.,"Wanting to increase the horsepower in my brushing, I opted for this bad boy. It's great and has a nice carrying case that comes with it too. There isn't much to say about a toothbrush but it works, is powerful, and has a nice ""I'm dying! Recharge me!"" beeping indicator. It's also nice that it stops after 2 minutes of brushing since sometimes you forget about it and don't realize how long you've been brushing them.One thing to consider is that it's a disposable item and the replacement brush heads are expensive. If cost is an issue then you should be going old school anyway and you'll do just fine.I've had it for over a year now and so far it has been great."
5,I actually enjoy brushing now,This is the first electric toothbrush I've purchased - I should have done it much sooner. It's actually made me want to brush my teeth! My teeth look & feel cleaner than they did w/manual brushes. The 2-minute timer takes all the guesswork out of how long you have to brush. I have had this since December 2011. I haven't had any major problems with it gunking up (like I saw mentioned in other comments) - although I have had to take the head off to clean up the base of the brush a couple of times.
5,Smile more!,"I owned an earlier model, purchased when they first hit the market for a much higher price. My dental appointments always go smoothly because using a Sonicare electric toothbrush helps reduce the tartar buildup. Between dental visits, using Sonicare gives me the same feeling as when my teeth have just had a cleaning.The only difference I could see in this model was the footprint on the base is a little smaller, a plus for small counter space. To my knowledge, after much research, there is no better sonic toothbrush than Sonicare. Well worth the investment."
5,Sonicare Essence Review,"The item was new in package, so needless to say it was excellent condition. Shipping was fast, I received it a matter of a few days!"
3,Not bad but unsanitary,Cons: The replacement brushes wear out quickly and are expensive. Nasty stuff grows very quickly in the crevices and screw on compartment. Hard to keep clean.Pros: Does get the laque better than conventional toothbrush. Charge holds for a while so that you can easily take it for a trip without having to pack the charger.
5,It is really worth it,I just love the toothbrush. when you charge it you can use it for more than a week with out recharging it. You can take it anywhere with you and for short trips you do not need to even take the charger. The brush it self is a good one.
2,Nice toothbrush if you don't mind mold,"Got this as a replacement for a more expensive Sonicare model. Toothcleaning wise, it's great, with one giant BUT: I found mold growing inside mine within a few months. Not just mildew, but jelly-like colonies. The top part unscrews from the bottom, charging part, plus the seal between the head and the body is not water tight. I cleaned it out, reassembled it, and then a few months later: more mold. I'd suggest splurging on one of the other Sonicare or similar products rather than deal with the potential grossness with this one."
2,Sonic are toothbrushEssence,I am a bit disappointed because this toothbrush does not signal each half minute so I can move to next cleaning area of my teeth. I thought the literature said it did.
4,Like this but hate having to buy a replacement all the time.,"So this is my fourth one of these tooth brushes I've owned. The battery is not serviceable so once it gets to a point that it will not hold a charge you have to throw it away and buy a new one. They last about a year or so before the battery gets to the point that it won't make it though a 2 min brush cycle. However, it cleans well and is soft on the gums."
2,Cheap Batteries,I had the better version for just over two years and then unfortunately it some how short circuited and stopped working. I then decided to get two of these models (1 for the wife) and with in 6 months one is completely dead and the other only last two days.The batteries in this model are hard to replace unlike the better versions which is mildly upsetting. I'd prefer something electrical like these to last more than a few years. I've got an electric shaver that has lasted well into five years.If I were to buy these tooth brushes for the rest of my life(every six months) I'd go through another 140! something to think about.
4,No regrets,"I'd been hearing from dentists for years that Sonicare toothbrushes were the best way to care for my teeth, so I finally this basic version when Amazon was having a sale. It did take a little getting used to... for the first few days, the 'tickling' sensation on my gums was very uncomfortable. However, that went away and I'm very happy with the product. I feel like my teeth really are cleaner and brighter. It's a little bit heavy and long, so it's taken some practice to maneuver it around my mouth without hitting my other teeth with the back of the brush--that really DOES rattle the head, and leaves the teeth a little sore. But, small price to pay. It's a great product."
5,best toothbrush,GREAT toothbrush! Dentist recommended for helping the kids get their teeth cleaner and gums healthier. It's takes about a week for them to get use to the idea that the toothbrush does all the work.
5,Amazing product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best toothbrush I ever owned. Every time I use it, it feels like I just came from the dentist ... but in a pleasant way :D"
5,Sonic Toothbrush,"Excellent tool for keeping the teeth clean! It tickles a bit, but you get used to it."
2,Brush bristles too rough!,I previously owned a sonicare 4200? model. The 4200 was about 4 years old and would no longer hold a charge even after taking it out of the charger.Loved my old sonicare! Brushes better than I ever could.My only complaint with the new 5300 I have is that the brush head bristles seem much stiffer than the older model.I searched for replacement heads with 'soft' or sensitive heads but could not find any!Sonicare - how about some different brush heads instead of all the variety of toothbrush models!
4,very simple and functional,very functional toothbrush. wish it were just a warning after 2 minutes and not a complete stop
2,It only has ONE setting!,I am unhappy with this product. There is only one setting and it goes WAY too fast. The toothpaste falls right off before you can truly get going! It feels way too rough on my sensitive teeth. I wish it had another setting that would go a bit slower.
5,Philips Sonicare HX5351,This product works well and I am happy I got the tooth brush.I would recommend this product It also has a travel case
5,"Very nice, but no model number on brush or brush head","This is a wonderful product which has eliminated my dental issues! Several model numbers are available. But there is no model number on the brush or brush head, so you have to kind of guess when you need to know it. Or keep the packaging (yuk!) Sloppy on Panasonic's part. Be ready to purchase new heads regularly and know that the non-replaceable battery will eventually die, leaving you with more e-waste to dispose of."
2,battery dead after 1 year use,"I have been using sonicare for about 1 year now. Right after I got this product, I noticed it cleans so much better than manual toothbrushes. Overall it left me with cleaner and whiter teeth.About the 2 minute smarttimer, I'm a little confused about what it should do. I've read some reviews that claim their toothbrush stops for 1 sec or so or flashes every 30 seconds to remind you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth. But for my Essence 5300, it just stops after 2 mins and I don't always divide it evenly on all my teeth.After using it for 1 year, the battery dead!!! At first the battery works well and can last on a 4 days trip. But now after one year use,I have to charge it on the charging dock every time I finish using it, and leave it charging for like 12 hours. Then it lasts only once and needs charging right after the next use! It's annoying because I have to keep my charging dock plugged in all the time."
1,Avoid the Black Mold,I agree with other reviewers who point out that the seal on this toothbrush is clearly defective and a terrible design flaw. Most people would be shocked to find that the collar of the brush can create black spots if the toothbrush is not taken fully apart and sanitized after EACH use. I did not have this problem with my old Sonicare that had an effective seal between the brush and the assembly. Go with another brand.
1,Really Pathetic Quality,"Really horrible quality. I spent over $100 on two handles and both batteries were dead in just over a year. Used and stored exactly as instructed.Please spare yourself a poor purchase. Find an alternate manufacturer. Or, save your receipt for the 2 year warranty, you'll definitely need it!"
2,won't hold a charge,Had the Phillips Sonicare Hx5351/30 a little over a year when I noticed it was not holding a charge for a week. Now after 19 months I have to charge it every other night. Do not like the handle as it is not easy to hang onto when my hand is wet. Brushes the teeth very good. Anoying when the charge goes out.
3,Died too soon,"I bought this product in Jan 2010 based on my past experience with Sonicare. It worked fine for a while and I always maintained the product very well. However, about 2 weeks ago, it stopped working. I tried recharging, cleaning etc but the problem (start, work for few seconds and then stop) still remains. I'm going to contact customer service at Philips and see what they have to say. Will report back if possible."
2,not that great,"I bought this item for my son, and he did not like it. I tried it myself, and found that it is noisy, vibrates too much. Waste of money."
2,Pay more for the better design.,"Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare Flex Care. The newer Flex Care models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally."
2,"Effective, but moisture logged","Although prior posts had warned this model of toothbrush is not sealed well and absorbs water/toothpaste into the inner cavity, I went for it anyway to use up a balance on my Amazon Gift card. Well, it completely lived up to its reviews. The toothbrush itself works fine, but it is really poor at keeping fluid/moisture out of the battery cavity. I have to remove the brush head after EVERY use, and rinse and wipe it out - a significant amount of water, toothpaste, ETC. sinks in no matter how well it is tightened. So, if you are the disciplined type, have at it..it works well and my teeth feel great. But, if you aren't the type to open the device and rinse the inner base twice a day, choose a lower maintenance model."
4,A little noisy,"This is my second Sonicare so I obviously like it well enough to buy it again. It is highly recommended by my dental hygenist. I do like the new, thinner design but I am disappointed that it seems to be a bit more noisy than my previous one."
2,It does not beep every 30 seconds to let you know when to move,"I needed a second tooth brush to travel with and not have to pack and unpack in between trips. You know how you always forget to pack something, so I got a second Sonicare. However this model does not beep or pause or stutter slightly every 30 seconds to indicate to the user when to switch quadrants in the mouth. I just have to guess and since I have used my other Sonicare for years knowing when to switch is not difficult to do; however a new user would have trouble with that."
5,Sonicare 5300,"Used to have the original Sonicare and loved it. Can't beleive how much more I enjoy this one. No more after spray if the brush is turned on outside of your mouth. Also fits in mouth much, much better. Charging base stays cleaner due to water drainage set up and so does the brush itself.Very good deal."
2,"Too many model choices, not enough quality","These Sonic toothbrushes now come in some 10 or more models; each with a bell and whistle that may or may not be the one you need for clean, plaque free teeth. Then of course, 6 months later it fails to recharge. $50 wasted; you go find and ship the warranty repair.My dentist recommends it but only because one brushes longer. Save your money, rub harder and longer with less expensive toothbrush."
3,Review,"I received this Sonicare 5300 about one month ago & after using it & really prefer my old Sonicare 4000. This new one has a different type brushes, full size, which sort of bounce across my teeth. The old Sonicare really feels to do a far beter job on my teeth.I did a contact with Sonicare & spoke online with a rep & explained my concern & was told that these were the only brushes now available.So do I keep the 5300 or return it ? Time will tell.Bill in FL"
2,gunk....,"I like the way it cleans my teeth, but the build-up of gunk and mold inside the brush is absurd; worst design ever. If you don't mind brushing your teeth with festering mold just an inch or two from your mouth, this is definitely the brush for you...."
1,"How about: ""I hate it"" ?","My sister, her husband and my wife has this toothbrush. I've used it once. Let me tell you the problem with this thing.CONS:1). Brain drilling noiseWhat is this? It this thing breaking the plaques on your teeth by sonic sound waves? What's this unbelievably high pitch super loud noise?2). Brushing experienceGillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Packageshakes and vibrates more than this product.3). The base (JOKE is on the customer)How can you keep this lame thing clean, when the base is build to make it fall. Who need that lame charging station that has no support to keep your toothbrush up? It falls down even with the wind. So go pick another set of brush head because your blowdryers cable made your toothbrush fall on the ground.4). ChargeLasts almost once... ONCE! You brush your teeth and then it need charging which seems to be taking all night long.But enough with the CONS let's talk about PROS.PROS:1). It's a toothbrush."
1,No thanks - want a refund/replacement,"The design of the body impractical and unhygienic - it fills up with water and toothpaste and spit presumably, and needs to be emptied and cleaned. Yuck.Mine is faulty and the head won't come off (others have tried) so another waste of money after paying over $30 for the replacement brushes.Seems like it is soldered on!Think I deserve a refund to be honest or a replacement product/toothbrush. Braun Oral B is so much better."
3,Great at brushing teeth,This brush does a fantastic job of brushing your teeth and travels well. I've used this overseas for 2+ weeks at a time without charging and it would still just keep on going.The only thing is the annoying odor that will inevitably accumulate on the inside of your brush after repeated use. Some of the crevices are almost impossible to get to and after the bacteria/sludge accumulates over time the odor becomes more and more apparent. Pretty annoying design flaw for an otherwise great toothbrush.
3,Good Product but Smells Bad,"Loved the toothbrush right away - exceptional cleaning ability. I still use it - just bought replacement heads.However, after using it for a week it started to smell. I rinsed it, cleaned it in alcohol, took it apart and sprayed it out - trying to rid it of this smell - it smells like dirty clothes or something foul. I can see why this is the bottom of the Philips Sonicare line and the potential need for a UV cleaner. I never needed that with any toothbrushes in the past though, and the smell seems to be coming from the handle of the brush where the head connects, so the UV head cleaner compartment they sell separtely wouldn't help, I don't think. It's just kind of gross."
5,great price!!!!!!!!!!,last time i bought one it was 5 years ago and it cost 79.99 this is just as good at 39.99 so i got a great deal and free shipping thanks
4,Can't do without it.,I have used a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for about 20 years and don't know what I would do without it. My original brush finally gave out and I just replaced it with this one. It is a less expensive model and does not have the 30 second buzzer to remind you to move on to another section of your mouth; I miss that but don't feel it is worth the significant difference in price for the model that has it. This is a great tootbrush and well worth the money.
4,Inexpensive Sonicare toothbrush,This relatively inexpensive electric toothbrush works OK. One disappointment its user reported to me: it does not do the brief pause after each 30 seconds so that you know when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth and when the recommended 2 minutes of brushing are over.
4,Philips sonicare essence 5300,"I have had a Philips sonicare electric toothbrush for a number of years and paid considerably more for the first one I bought. This new acquisition is an excellent replacement for my worn out one, and the price was very, very reasonable. It works to do a thorough job of cleaning teeth and I get very high marks when I visit the dental hygenist. Thank you Amazon for making this unit available at such a good price.Russ Huff"
5,Great product - great buy!,"Have owned this model for about 6 years. I think the battery finally couldn't be charged any more. Very pleased with having the same product again. Have since bought this for our adult children, both of whom like it as well as we do."
2,Clean teeth..but you'll have mold under the brush head.,"Simply a poorly designed brush head. My teeth feel and look cleaner than with a traditional brush, but I had mold under the brush head within 1 week. My wife's began showing mold within 2 weeks. That is an unacceptable design flaw. The instructions state to remove the brush head weekly for cleaning, so Philips is obviously aware of the problem."
2,Beware - Batteries cannot be replaced!,"I purchased this product at the recommendation of my dental hygienist. The product was fine until the batteries died and I found out they could not be replaced. The warranty is only for 2 years (the product's life), so this is a very expensive disposable toothbrush!"
2,Warning - Nasty Gunk Buildup,I had owned an Oral-B Sonic Complete S-320 that finally was no longer able to charge so I ended up replacing it with the Sonicare Essence. The sonic technology in both toothbrushes is similar so there was no real change in the actual functionality of the toothbrush. I much prefer the sonic vibrating toothbrushes to the Oral-B vitality types that just spin.The one major difference with Sonicare is that the toothbrush heads are much larger and more expensive. Even worse is the fact that the way they screw onto the base unit makes it very easy for water to seep in and for really nasty smelling gunk to build up inside the handle. I've gotten so frustrated with this gunk and with the toothbrush heads unscrewing themselves that I'm going back to order the discontinued Sonic Complete and hoping that it will help me to get that funky smell out of my head.
4,Seems good in the short term,Seems good in the short term. I think the usual electeric brushes are equally good.
1,This toothbrush is terrible!,I really don't understand all the good reviews on this toothbrush. It absolutely harbors germs and bacteria in many places. It is difficult to keep clean and I will never buy this model again. A complete waste of money!
4,Philips Sonicare,"Good product...comes with two heads and a separate holder for the heads. In addition, a travel head protector was included. Solid product. Would recommend."
4,Great Brushing Action,I bought this unit to replace my old Sonicare unit that had a very weak battery (4 years old) and the inability to secure the toothpaste for the self dispenser of the old unit.This unit provides a great brushing action as my old one did. I miss the toothpaste dispenser and the built in timer that beeped every 30 seconds during the 2 minute timed brushing period. I now use my digital watch to mark the 30 second intervals. I should mention that this unit cost about 60% of what I paid for my old unit 4 years ago.I highly recommend this unit for good dental hygiene.
4,Love It!,"This gets my teeth way cleaner than a regular toothbrush,and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. Only think I dont like is that a crust ends up on the bottom of the toothbrush when you sit in the cradle. Other than that, I love it!"
5,Best Toothbrush!,This toothbrush is amazing! It cleans your teeth without you making much effort. I have never had cleaner teeth. And it turns off automatically after two minutes. Its a must buy!
3,Good enough,"Have had this for 3 weeks. It seems good enough- not fantastic, but it is OK for the price. I have had toothbrush that did a better job( cheapo from CVS) and cheaper but only lasted 3 weeks.The added test will be time...."
3,DENTAL CARE,"MY DENTAL HYGIENIST SUGGESTED THIS PRODUCT TO ME. I WAS BRUSHING TOO HARD AND CHANGING MY MANUAL TOOTHBRUSH EVERY TWO WEEKS. ALTHOUGH I CAN CLEARLY FEEL AND SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY MY (MOUTH) TEETH, GUMS, AND TONGUE HAVE IMPROVED SINCE I BEGAN USING PHILIPS SONICARE I AM DISAPPOINTED IN REGARD TO HOW LONG THE CHARGE LAST. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS PRODUCT WILL MAINTAIN ITS CHARGE FOR A WEEKS VACATION WITHOUT RECHARGING.I AM BRUSHING MY ENTIRE MOUTH LONGER BECAUSE I HAVE LESS PROBLEMS WITH SENITIVITY AND THE SONICARE FEELS GOOD. I THINK THAT I NEED MORE TIME USING THIS PRODUCT TO GIVE IT A FAIR REVIEW. MY UPCOMING DENTAL VISIT WILL ALSO WEIGH HEAVILY ON MY OPINION. I WOULD NOT HESITATE RECCOMMENDING THIS ITEM TO A FRIEND."
5,"Great toothbrush, watch the price","**Pros**- Two minute timer that still works if you turn it off and on again temporarily to spit.- Really gets teeth clean (surprised my dentist)- Price**Cons**- The price really fluctuates on this thing, be careful if you're spending over $50 for it.- Makes your head ring when the plastic part of the brush head touches your tooth.5 Stars. Really enjoy this over manual brushing."
5,Really Like This Toothbrush,"For what you pay this brush is excellent. It has great power, almost like being in a dentist's office for a cleaning. But make sure the cap holding the brush is securely fastened or you might get lower power. This happened to me. When I removed the cap to clean it after a couple of weeks of use I realized the cap was not securely attached. After putting it fully in place, wow. It does all that it advertises."
4,Review of Essence 5300,"This is the best toothbrush I have used because the ""arm"" of the brush is thin, curved and the brush is oval (not square)...very easy reach of back teeth."
3,Sonicare Essence 5300 Toothbrush,"I had my original Sonicare for 8 years, and LOVED it! I replaced it with this one when the battery stopped recharging, and I like it, but did not realize that this one did not come with the ""quadpacer""timer to pace brushing. It's not a big deal, as the new brush is every bit as effective as the old one, but I was ""trained"" with the quadpacer on the old model. I love the way this brush works, and the way my teeth feel after I brush. When my old brush finally failed I used a conventional brush, and within weeks was feeling sensitivity, the Sonicare really helps. The quality of this brush, the threaded head guard, and the head itself just doesn't feel as solid. But it was a product name I knew and the price was right."
5,Fabulous preventative dental care!,"I used to faithfully use a manual tootbrush, tartar control toothpaste, floss, mouth rinse, and twice-a-year professional cleanings. However, I still had a few spots where my gums got tender or swollen. With the Sonicare, I noticed a difference very quickly and the trouble spots soon disappeared. My family has used Sonicare toothbrushes for years; it's the best preventative device! (Note: I use a manual toothbrush when traveling and after a few days, those trouble spots threaten to reappear. Once home, the Sonicare banishes those spots.)"
5,Sonicare Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush,"I've used Sonicare toothbrushes before and really like them; not only have I noticed considerable improvement in my teeth and gums, but my dentist has also commented on what a much better job I'm doing in taking care of my teeth. The hygenist asked if I was doing something different and, of course, I have been using the Sonicare for a number of years now and there is noticeable improvement. This purchase was made because my old charger for the first Sonicare I purchase no longer worked and I could not find just a charger in any store, when I checked on line I found charger, carrier, and toothbrush with additional replacement head for less than I paid for the battery operated one."
5,excellent power toothbrush,I like the Sonicare power toothbrush. very satisfied with using it. highly recommend
1,Go with Oral-B Instead,"I've had this toothbrush for a few years, and it has a consistent problem with mold growing in the head piece (they call it a nut). I was told this was a common issue, and they offered to replace the toothbrush, even though it was out of warranty, and then spent three days trying to get out of having to live up to that offer.In short, the toothbrush is basically unusable, unless you like brushing your teeth with a molding, reeking toothbrush head. There's a reason why they now sell a super championship ultraviolet cleaner for $50. Philips customer service is just about as good. My wife has an Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400, and it works like a charm. No mold issues there, and it's a rotary brush just like the dentist uses. I'd recommend avoiding the Sonicare like the plague, unless that's exactly what you want to get."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this Sonicare to replace an older model. I was hopng to replicate the older model with an updated one, as the battery was no longer holding a charge. Unfortunately, this model doesn't offer the Quad Pacer timer as did the older one. Unfortunately, there was really no way to determine whether or not the new model had the desired QuadPacer timer. It might seem a tad high maintenance, but the feature lets the user know when 30 seconds is up and time to move on to a different area of teeth to clean. I am frustrated by (a) the lack of the timer feature and (b) the lack of clarity and information available to me when making the decision. Even the instruction manual states ""not all models."" It seems to me that the Quad Pacer timer should be a feature on all the Sonicare models. I was going to return this model, but chose to keep it--or pass it on to my wife. If you've had a Sonicare with the Quad Pacer, this isn't the model to chose."
3,Works well BUT has less capacity in rechargeable battery. Disappoints.,"First, I did not buy this from Amazon. I have used Sonicare cordless toothbrshes for the past 8-10 years. I bought this one as part of a double pack from a warehouse club (C). In the past a full charge always lasted a week, using it twice a day. After a few months of use this one now only keeps a charge for a day or two, using it twice a day. I suspect Sonicare has cheapened their rechargeable battery, one with less power, less capacity. Very disappointing & annoying. May switch to Oral-B next time. UPDATE: 1/2013. I did switch to Oral-B, a double pack on sale. Very happy with it, and the charge lasts MUCH longer."
2,Propriatary Battery,"I have had 2 of these toothbrushes. They do perform very well while the battery lasts. After about a year both batteries have gone bad.. lasting about 30 seconds after a 24 hr charge.. I was in the navy and am pretty quick about brushing my teeth.. 30 seconds just isnt enough. if the battery was replacable, I would give this product 5 stars.. as is.. 2 is best I can do... No.. I will not buy another one till they fix the propriatary battery problem!"
1,failed in three months,bought this sonicare essence toothbrush in april 2012 and in july 2012 battery failed and product no longer works..buy something else
2,Expensive and not made for the long term!,"While the sonicare does keep my teeth much cleaner than a non-electronic brush, it wears out after only a couple of years of usage. Mine no longer charges, and the batteries which power the toothbrush cannot be replaced. I like the simplicity of the essence, but would appreciate a model with replaceable batteries and a more efficient charging system. Moreover, the brush heads are very expensive. All together, I'm not sure that the product is worth the regular expense."
4,great item for the price,"This is a really nice electric toothbrush. My dentist wanted to sell me the ""deluxe"" model - same brand for 4X the price of this one. It does not have all the bells & whistles but I do not need a massager for my teeth! This does the same thing for my teeth and gums as my dentist's would do and my dental hygeniest said this one was a ""very good electric toothbrush and she would recommmend it to her patients"""
2,I must be the only one who doesn't like my sonicare,"Don't get me wrong, this made my teeth feel wonderfully clean, but the vibration is unbearable. It is so strong thet I feel like my brain is rattling and it almost tickles. I read the instructions and other peoples advice to keep using it and ""I'd get used to it."" That never happened (even after a few weeks), I just find it extremely uncomfortable. I wish I could tolerate it better because I love the cleaness my teeth feel, but I can't stand the vibration strength."
2,My Sonicare toothbrush didn't last a year,"I like Sonicare products, and my old Sonicare toothbrush - a different model - lasted for many years. However, this model lasted only 10 months - now it no longer holds a battery charge. And my window to return it to Amazon has closed. Does anyone know what the guarantee is for this model? Unfortunately, I can't find any paperwork other than the order print-out from Amazon."
1,Gets gross,"The inside of where the tooth brush attaches to the motor gets really gross. Mold gross in there constantly, and we keep it clean. The other Sonicare with the smaller toothbrush attachment is way better and doesn't have a cesspool growing inside."
5,I won't go back to a manual toothbrush...,"This is the first power toothbrush I have used. It works very well. I had to use my manual toothbrush once since starting to use the Sonicare Essence, needless to say I won't be doing that again. It doesn't even compare to the clean feeling you get with using the Sonicare. It feels like you just came out of the dentist chair. It doesn't hurt and it's not uncomfortable.Just don't take it out of your mouth until it's turned off or you will have splatters all over your bathroom."
4,Great brushing,"I had this toothbrush for about 3 years. The battery will no longer charge. The brushing is so good that I want to replace it with a similar quality of cleaning. I am thorough when I brush with a regular toothbrush, but I can always feel a difference when I use them. It is worth it to me to get that much cleaner with the sonicare vs manual. Bummed that the battery life isn't longer, but maybe a few years is all I can ask?"
4,phillips sonicare essence 5300 toothbrush,"The price was right, but I didn't realize this product doesn't have the ""quadrapacer function"" (beeping every 30 seconds, so that each quadrant of the mouth gets 30 seconds' attention). If I had realized that, I would have looked for a model that had that feature. However, its preformance is great. I liked that it came with a velcro-closed soft-sided travel case."
3,Sonicare 5300,"I purchased this unit to replace an older Sonicare I had for many years. While this newer unit works, it lacks the automatic timer of the former unit. In addition, the replacement heads are not interchangable, so I ended up with several unusable replacement heads. This newer unit appears to have a more fragile head stem that the other.While the unit functions adequately, I was disappointed that it did not have the attributes of the former one."
5,Good product,Bought for daughter to brush easier and better.Came w/ great case she can use for sleepovers.charger works well so far.
5,PHILIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH,I love this toothbrush because it removes alot of plaque. I can see my gums improving because I'm using this brush. This is definantly the #1 Dentist recomended brush. When I brush my teeth it feels like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentists office.
2,Very Disappointed,"I got this as a replacement for the Sonicare toothbrush I had been using for many years. I was very disappointed to find that this model does not have the 30-second quadrant timing. This may not seem like much, but I've come to use and depend on that timer over the years, and I had no reason to believe that my replacement Sonicare toothbrush would not have it. I plan to replace this brush with an Oral B as soon as possible."
5,toothbush,"this is the kind of toothbrush our dentist recommended. in a matter of one week the wifes teeth were whiter. the dentist said that it will remove the tarter, plaque, coffe stains from your teeth. it really works. this is the only toothbrush that we will use from now on. after a week my teeth were getting whiter--this coming from a chewer and a IV coffee drinker"
4,Phillips sonicare electric toothbrush,"The toothbrush is exactly as expected. I have used one for the past two years, and it performs exactly as expected and is very convenient. It's a no-frills model; therefore, it's less likely to develop difficulties."
3,Great for cleaning but lacks the QuadPacer timer,"I have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for over a decade. They are great at cleaning your teeth and I think the older, thick-handled brush design cleans better than the newer FlexCare models, though the latter have a Lithium-Ion battery, which last longer and lack Cadmium for better waste disposal. My complaint about this model specifically is that it does not have the built-in QuadPace timer, which (in more upscale models) pauses briefly every 30 seconds, so you know to switch quadrants. Instead, I must rely on a clock with second timer for this feature. I had wrongly thought that this was a standard feature, not a premium option. Had I known this feature was lacking, I would have kept looking. Be sure to replace the brush heads periodically for best results. Though they are spendy, your teeth are worth it because they are irreplaceable."
1,Gave up the ghost after 4 weeks,"After only four weeks or so, this Philips toothbrush started to randomly stop in the middle of the tooth brushing. Unusable."
4,Very good,"This was my first power toothbrush and it has been great. It felt weird in the beginning, but that went away quickly. I think that my teeth are cleaner; I am satisfied."
2,Don't Like It,"I bought this thinking it had a timer on it, like my old Sonicare. This model does not. That is the bad thing about ordering something rather than buying it in a store."
2,Horrible Vibration,"I can't believe there aren't any vibration complaints about this model. I bought mine and turned it on as soon as I took it out of the box. It was loud, and the vibration in the handle was so strong that I couldn't comfortably hold it for more than 10 seconds. I have carpal tunnel, and it was really aggravated by this brush.My husband, who has very strong hands, tried it. He held it for about five seconds and said ""take it back.""My dentist recommended that I use this, so I'm going to have to give the more expensive Flexcare a try."
5,Great Cleaning Machine,"My dental hygienist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush to me because of its ability to gently clean the gumline well. It is doing an excellent job. I was reluctant to switch from my Oral B because it was fairly new and I like the small brushhead. However Sonicare also has a small but different shape brushhead and softer bristles. Another feature unrelated to cleaning my teeth is the smooth plastic handle which is easy to wipe clean and does not leave deposits on the base. The base also has a place to rewind unusable cord. My oral B handle looks hideously dirty and there is no way to clean it off because of the matte rubber finish. Also every week I have to scrub the base with Q-tips to clean off deposits, which is annoying. The Sonicare gets A+ for design and performance."
5,Great unit,This is the third one of these I have had and would purchase another when this wears out they last about five to seven years.
2,brush head problems; poor design,"Product works fine, but the head design leads to a buildup of gunk and slime. The head seals leak, and unless you disassemble the unit after every use, you get a buildup of slime inside the unit. Very poor design. I switched over to oral-b and have been very happy."
3,Works great,The toothbrush is great. I feel my teeth are really clean after every use. The timer sets off after 2 minutes which I think is adequate time for brushing.The only problem with this brush that its not sealed really well. The manual says to clean every week but I feel the need to clean it after every use since the water and toothpaste gets inside the cover. Cleaning is easy but I'd rather avoid if I can. I heard the newer model - flexcare doesn't have this problem but again its more than double the cost.
3,Go Upscale!,"I've used Sonicare tooth brushes for a number of years. My recent purchase was to replace the one I was using. This model does not have the little beep reminder every 30 seconds and I miss it. If you buy, go upscale to a model with this feature. The brush does a marvelous job. I just can't time it right."
2,Electronic toothbrush,"I'm not happy. I have used Sonicare toothbrushes ever since they were invented. At first there was only one model. When it wore out after many years I replaced it with a one just like it. When the company was sold to Phillips they started making several different models. When I recently had to replace my second one(after many years) I still bought the basic, most economical model. I have no hopes that my new one will last 1/2 as long as the old ones. Every time I use it it has leaked water into the brush handle and I have to dump it out. It seems very flimsy."
5,Better then Oral B,"I had an older sonicare toothbrush Advance. After two years, I switched to oral B procare because the replacement heads were less money. I regret doing that. The oral B procare set came with lots of attachments but it never cleaned my mouth as well as the sonicare tooth brush. I have been using Sonicare E5300 for a week now and there is a noticeable difference in the way my teeth look and fell. I don't get plaque bubuildup along the gum line during the day and the coffee stains are coming off."
1,ONLY LASTED A YEAR,"My first Sonicare lasted forever. The last one - with lots of goofy, Microsoft-type features - stopped after a year. So I've bought an Oral B."
5,GREATEST toothbrush EVER! Out of the Dentist CLEAN!,"I've had this toothbrush for just over three years. I love it! The only problem is that it's dying right now. I have to put it on the charger everyday just so I can use it again the next day. The vibrating mechanism gets mold in it, which is really gross. I recommend this product if you don't mind cleaning the handle part of old water and moldy scum. It cleans your teeth so well you think you just got out of the Dentist. Just beware of the design flaws, and enjoy a VERY clean mouth."
4,Great Deal!,"Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 Power ToothbrushI love the Sonicare toothbrushes. My teeth feel really clean! Amazon has a great price, customer service. Delivery was fast & free:)"
5,Sonicare Tooth Brush,"I have gingervitus and must keep my teeth free from tarter build up.The Sonicare Tooth Brush has helped me reduce dental visits by half. I replaced my original Sonicare last month after 10 years daily use. My Dental Hygentist has given me high marks since I started using the power tooth brush. Good buy, my first one cost over $90.00 and it saved me over $100.00 a year in teeth cleaning charges. I may never change vendors."
3,a bit loud,"My husband loved his old Sonicare, but it was getting a bit worn so I decided to purchase new ones for all of us for Christmas.Overall, I don't think there is anything ""wrong"" with the item, but it is very loud and I sort of cringe when I go to use it. I end up using it about once every other day and just use my regular, quite, manual toothbrush the rest of the time. I am not charging it very often, hoping the reduced charge will tone it down a bit. My son cannot use it at all, it is much too loud and jarring, he is 12. I ended up purchasing him one of the cheap spin brushes for $10 and he is more willing to use that.If you aren't bothered by loud, high pitched, vibrating noises then it will probably be great. It doesn't bother my husband at all."
1,Buy Something Else,"This is a very poor product. No matter what I've tried, I cannot get it to work more than maybe 30 seconds without needing to be recharged again. During the few seconds it runs, it's great. So for a mouth with about 3 teeth, it would be a wonderful product. But if you have more teeth than that, you should look elsewhere."
1,"Messy, mold grows quickly. Be sure to dry completely","Not only did Philips not fulfil their rebate, but this version of the product is horrible. Look elsewhere. Mold grows inside the handle, the brush is frayed after less than a month of usage, replacement brushes should last 3 - 6 months - so I thought. Very, very disappointing."
4,good,"bristles are softer than the oral B I had, but still not much quieter. Seems to do a good job cleaning."
5,Robot toothbrush!,"...that's what it feels like a little robot cleaning your teeth!I used to use Oral B Sonic something which I loved too and lasted me almost 2 years, but half the brush head fell off! The Philips definitely feels more powerful and doesn't have 2 segments like the Oral B so I doubt that would fall apart. Weird feeling at 1st and 2nd use, but you adapt real quick. Simple and effective and so far so good, plus I got a really good price at $39.99 and I don't think there was tax added (that's why I love Amazon), so a great buy all in all.Simple, Powerful and Effective. Thumbs up :)"
4,"Good as my old Sonicare Elite, but cheaper","My old Sonicare Elite finally gave out after many years of service. Purchased this one and was surprised to find that the handle is slightly bigger than the old Elite.Works just the same though, and at a great price."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I had an Oral-B sonic toothbrush for a few years that I was happy with that finally died. Either that or the button broke. Either way, it was acting possessed on a recent trip and just started going off by itself on the counter without the charging stand in the middle of the night.I didn't want to spend that much again, so I thought I'd try the Philips brand instead. Well, the Oral-B is a far superior design. This one rattles when I use it, and the silicon sleeves are necessary.Yes, the end result of very clean teeth is the same as the Oral-B, and the price of this unit is less expensive, but I'd have to say that I'd rather spend more money on the Oral-B to begin with than deal with all the annoyances of this one."
5,Awesome!,Great deal! I've been using this model for years when mine finally died and I still had 2 brush heads left so this was the perfect replacement. I like the upgraded model.
4,Philliops Sonicare HX5351/30,"This is the first electric toothbrush I have had since a child, but I must say. It works wonderful, feels like I have been to the dentist. I love the feature that shuts off the unit after a while but also the beeping to move on to another section of your mouth. Throughly impressed, can't wait for my husband to us as well, ordered additional heads so we both could enjoy the experience. Very pleased with two uses. I don't think I will ever revert back to a regular manual toothbrush again."
2,Sonicare toothbrush,"I was not very happy with this item, it did not use the same brushes that I still had from an earlier sonicare item. The brush wore out very quickly. Not one of my better buys......."
2,Not my favorite electric toothbrush,I wish this toothbrush had a softer more efficient touch to it's brushing as I have had more than five electric toothbrushes over the years as this one tend to be rather harsh on my teeth. I bought two more heads for it so I guess I will have to use it for a while or just give it away. I would prefer the old sonicare toothbrushes that have a softer more efficient touch to them. My dentist sold this in his office so I thought it would be a good one. Oh well I suppose different strokes for different folks.
5,Get the cleanest teeth ever!!!,"Yes Sonicare has come out with newer models with all the fancy features. Word of advice, save your money and go with this model. It does all you need and will leave your teeth clean and sparkling. I love this product and it does everything stated."
3,Good while it lasts,"I like this toothbrush and get good reports from my dentist, however, it's an expensive toothbrush that will only last a couple of years. This is about my 4th one because of the good results I get at the dentist's office but it seem like, for the price, it should last longer than it does."
3,Good toothbrush,"It is not cheap, and the battery does not last long, my last one battery die in a year. otherwise it gets the job done, my teeth fell clean"
5,Excellent Buy,Love the product! Got free shipping on this product but would opt for regular shipping next time since it took 9 days to arrive.
5,Love This Unit!,I was using a oral B unit before the Sonicare. Wow! What a huge difference. The Sonicare instantly feels like it's providing more cleaning power. Love this unit!
4,Nice,"I fully charged the toothbrush before i started to use it, it lasted 28 days on a normal use. I brush really clean, the 2-min timer is great. However, it needs frequent clean on the brush head, brush handle and the base(every other day)."
4,Big Fun,"Okay, it's not the deepest, most meaningful stuff in the world, but it's really FUN. Fats just eats up the keyboard. I like to play this one in my office just to see how long it takes people to tap and hum along. Get it. It was cool then; it's cool now."
5,The Joint Is Jumpin!,"I'll make this short and sweet! Ready? Here 'tis! Try to stay gloomy and listen to Fats at the same time. Go on! I dare ya! Yes Yes, The Joint IS Jumpin! Share it with your friend and make them happy, too!"
5,Mikey liked it,"Had found a copy of this cookbook in my local library, liked the content and found several good specific Tex-Mex recepies, so bought the book."
1,Did any 'Dummie' test drive this book ?,"Fine intentions but needs to be tested/edited. KIS - Keep it Simple! Code/Examples don't work. Break up each skill into a simple easy to do session with code and examples that work. Why are the exercises mixing in complicated Java pages that don't work anyway! I was so anxious to get a book I thought would be written for a dummy like me but I get a book that requires troubleshooting & cursing. Please post updates/fixes to the dummies site. 1 star is for software, setup instructions, and some good explanations -- but i can't recommend, 'cause i can't use. NOTE: I found Marty Hall's ""Core Servlets & JavaServer Pages"" is super for beginners or anyone needing concise & working samples."
2,First Impressions?,"So, here we are at the start of another in the ""Dummies"" series and I'm left wondering who's the dummy in question.The book is pretty readable, but you would expect this from the Hungry Minds stable.However, there are a few errors... And I'm only at Chapter 2.I will battle on, but I'm left with the feeling that a conscientious editor would have picked up on the bugs in the example code, the directory path errors, dodgy illustrations and the mismatch between the example code on the CD and the text.Would I buy it again?Perhaps, but only after a few patches to the original release. ;-)"
1,Bugs/Typos in Example Code,"The first couple of pages were well written. Then the first example didn't work. Now I figured out how to correct the errors even though i'm only a new JSP programmer. I shouldn't have to do this! Nobody should. Terrible way to start a book. Who proofread and compiled the example source code? Demote or fire them. This error hurt the author and the reputation of the ""Dummies"" line of books."
4,Stretching DVD,This video is a good addition to the book from years ago............it is also a wonderful way to stay in shape without the stress and strain.
4,"Stretching, The DVD","I have used the book on and off throughout the past ten years. I got tired of opening the book and because of continued use, the pages have separated from the binding. I ordered the DVD thinking it would be a series of stretches in rather quick motion. But instead, it is a series of moves but done very slowly. The instructor takes his time explaining each move and making sure the move is done correctly. There is nothing wrong with the DVD but it is for individuals who have never stretched before, overweight, or have experienced injuries. It is a great intro to stretching."
5,Straight Forward Stretching,"This is a comprehensive collection of stretches that you can do for various sports and otherwise to address various portions of your body. Though I often do yoga right now, I do use this one as a reference and also to helps focus on some areas more. A good combination with yoga routines and if you are not a yoga type, for whatever reason, its approach is straightforward and should be added to your other workouts."
2,Stretching DVD - from the 80s,"I bought this DVD to help me learn ways of stretching, as I am an avid cyclist and runner. The methods of stretching are useful, but not any more useful than ANY yoga DVD. The setup is old, humor bad, and it is quite boring. I could only watch it a couple of times. Now I just do a few stretches that I liked from the program. I recommend skipping this DVD."
5,Big and useful!,"This was an upgrade from my old high school thesaurus, several decades old and much smaller; I could never find the exact word I wanted. In this book, I CAN find the word I want plus several I hadn't thought of that are just as good, maybe better. A huge improvement!"
2,Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus - paperback,My criticism is only related to the very small type used in the paperback version-I can't read it at all without a magnifying glass. I also have the hardback version of this thesaurus and it is wonderful-I would give it 5 stars. Wanted another thesaurus for another location but the paperback is useless to me because ot the tiny print.
1,weak rubber,The dinoasaur is soft and a great size. But the tail was cracked and bent in the packaage itself. If the material had been more durable I would have loved to keep it.
2,good brush while it lasted,"Yes Sonicare is the market leader. However, their quality control is slipping. I purchased this toothbrush in Sept 2010. By January 2011 it would no longer hold a charge. Past the product return window. I did buy another Sonicare, but I'm also posting this review for others to be aware. They will replace the handle, but only 28 days from purchase for cash return."
2,Why won't my Sonicare work?,"I bought a sonicare set a few years ago. It worked but we didn't really like it, so we put it away in a closet. I decided recently to give it another try, but no matter how long I leave it plugged in, neither of the toothbrushes will work. What's going on? I can't see where one might install a new battery, so I am stumped."
2,disappointing toothbrush,"I purchased this electric toothbrush recently and am sorry I did. Although the manual does not mention it, Sonicare expects you to:1) remove the brush unit from the handle,2) clean it, and 3)store it separate from the handle each time you use the toothbrush. I recently had trouble replacing the brush unit and called Sonicare for help, only to find out the operator knew less about the toothbrush than I did and was unaware of the cleaning procedure outlined in the manual. I finally managed to get the brush off but have been having a difficult time finding a place where I can purchase the toothbrush unit, which needs to be replaced every 3 months!"
3,e5500,I like the product but I do not think it is functioning properly. I would like to talk with someone about it.
5,Sonicare Essence e5500,Found the toothbrush to be very good for my teeth and gums. Cleans all the plaque and food caught in between the teeth. Great on hart to reach places like in back of my wisdom teeth. User's guide said I could expect to have to recharge the power brush every two weeks. I am going on 4 weeks and the charge is still good.
1,Failed after 8 months.,After 8 months of use once a day by one mature adult the toothbrush failed completely. It will not even turn on. I would not recommend the e5500 Power Toothbrush to anyone.
2,Buy a Different Design,"We bought this in November and have had mold issues within the brushhead mechanism. We have cleaned it, even soaked it in bleach but it's a PIA to continue to try to cope with the design flaw. Additionally, it is true that the handset is very difficult to keep clean and collects water and toothpaste residue. Even the threads around the outside of the handle are difficult to keep clean. We will be looking at either Oral B - Pulsonic, or another SoniCare with the pin-type brush head attachment."
2,Design ia flawed,"Fluid leaks into the battery necessitating very frequent cleaning. Sonicare has been getting progressively worse. This is probably related to ownership by Phillips. My first one (original Sonicare) lasted 8 years, second one 2 years. I don't think this one will last the year. My advice, check out the higher end models and see if they have a better design."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible",This thing is loud! You can't brush your upper teeth without it vibrating loudly against your lower and vice versa. And remember. Once you use it it's not returnable. Worst $80 I've ever lost.
5,Great Toothbrush,This was my first electric brush and it is everything that other reviewers claim.I highly recommend!
4,"A nice product, but expensive","Overall, I really like the Sonicare Essence power toothbrush. It works much better than a manual brush, and the 4 phase time feature is quite nice. What I do not like about it is the cost. The replacement heads are very expensive, and you'll need to change them at least every couple of months."
5,Sonicare Essence e5500,"Great product, the smaller size brush helps get into the difficult spaces providing good cleaning. The 30 second timing for each area is an excellent help. I'd buy it again with no reservations."
4,Surprisingly good,"Initially I feared the arm to the brush was too spindly and would easily break. Also thought the brush itself was too small. In fact, though, it works great and I'm very pleased with the overall performance."
4,Works well but needs a few improvements.,"Does a good job but not easy to clean on the inside, vibration's a little too rough and loud."
5,Try It!!,"I never even considered buying a powered toothbrush before, but I was on one of my Amazon buying sprees and saw this for a great price, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was very amazed at how much smoother my teeth felt, like they had just been cleaned by a dentist! The vibration of the brush head is something I am not fond of, but very willing to put up with in order to have cleaner teeth! The brush head doesn't look too sturdy, but I've been using it for over a month and it's fine, so I guess it's stronger than it looks! One thing to always keep in mind is to not turn it on before it gets put into your mouth, and once it's in your mouth do not take it out until it's turned off, or else toothpaste will spray over everything!"
2,Buy the FlexCare with or without the UV,"Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare FlexCare. The newer FlexCare models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally."
4,excellent product,"overall, this is my 2nd sonicare, and overall i'd say its a fine, excellent product.a couple of notes:1. the brushheads that come standard with this package are very stiff. They make manual toothbrushes with soft heads...i don't see why they can't offer the same with electronic brushes.2. there are a lot of little tiny crevices which can get dirty/clogged fast....which makes cleaning a pain.3. the newer models seem louder than the previous models. The older ones had this pleasant light humming noise,,,,but this model functions with a loud obnoxious buzz(similarly like the oral b's)."
5,Great product,Our last one gave out after many years and owed us nothing. The new design is an improvement over the old design and seems to contain all the good elements of the old design.
5,Satisfied,"This product does an excellent jobI just hope I can disable the ""auto-off"" function, because 2 minutes is not long enough for me."
4,Smiling more!,"My hygenist recommended that I get a Sonicare. What a great product. It takes a little getting used to the vibrating feeling on your teeth, but what a difference it makes. My teeth are noticably whiter and my gums feel much better. It is set to run in four 30 second increments which is great to make sure you cover your entire mouth for the appropriate amount of time. My mouth feels great every time I brush!I withhold the rating of five stars, as no product is perfect.As always, AMAZON is super fast with products arriving. Never disappointed."
1,Buyer beware,"If you don't mind that the Sonicare toothbrushes last under a year - even when you replace the heads and follow all their instructions - then this is for you. At my dentist's insistence, after a first failure for a more expensive model, I bought this lemon (after reading all the reviews). It almost made it to 10 months...I am switching to oral B."
5,A top quality item at a reasonable price.,This item came in the factory box and was well protected enroute. I shop-ed around for this item and found it to be even cheaper on this site thanWal-Mart. This item works extremly well; my dentist uses one and alsothinks it is great. The shipping was efficient and fast.
3,not for me,"I decided to give it a try after reading so many good reviews about this product. I was very disappointed. I don't understand why the speed cannot be changed. It's too fast for me and the head is not soft enough. For about $90, I certainly expected much more. I felt it was not different from a electronic razor with a toothbrush head."
4,Review of Toothbrush,Great product for dental care. The only drawback is the cost of the replacement brushes.
2,Disappointed,"I've had Sonicare electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years. The Elite model was my favorite, but it failed prematurely due to a problematic on/off switch (rubber covering failed). The first time, it failed under warranty, but the second failure wasn't covered (they'll only replace it once). Based on feedback from a Sonicare customer service rep, I recently replaced it with the more basic Sonicare Essence e5500 model; but it was big, clunky and noisy, so I returned it. Instead I purchased an Oral B, which I love; very happy I made the switch. The quality of Sonicare products seems to have slipped."
2,Philips Sonicare Toothbrush Essence e5500,"My disappointment is that it's not built nearly as well as my older model and probably won't last as long; seems cheap by comparison. Also, no matter how well you wipe it after use, it still leaks water from the joint of the holder and the brush head. This transfers to the charger. Small point perhaps, but sloppy. As with my older model, the inside cavity must be cleaned I'd judge weekly. My older brush from Philips did not leak though. I'm thinking of returning the e5500 toothbrush and buying my older model again.That said, it does a decent job of brushing and the angled brush head is convenient. My older model also did a decent job of brushing."
1,Useless quality control,"Owned a Sonicare original for over 10 years until the batteries finally wouldn't hold charge for about 2 days. Bought a new e5500. After 24hrs of charging it will run for about 2 minutes. If unused, it doesn't hold a charge after 30 minutes (elapsed time, not 30 minutes of use!).Seems like the Philips buy-out ruined their quality control. Very unhappy with this product."
3,Great product with one defect,"This is a terrific product.Unfortunately, I have had to buy three of these over the last two years, since the button that turns the brush on has broken in the first two, each after about two years of use.If Philips fixes this, they have a 5 star product."
5,Philips Sonicare Essence e5500 Power Toothbrush,So far no problems. Used it for about a month now. The future will tell
5,toothbrush does the job,"The toothbrush is comfortable to hold and reminds you of the 30 seconds you need to spend on each part of your mouth. Recommended by my dentist, I can feel the difference."
5,It will clean your teeth like nothing else,I was skeptical that a tooth brush could be worth $80.00It has proven to be worth every cent and MORE......It has improved my gums as well as keeping my teeth fantastically clean.Easy to use.Easy to travel with.I am impressed and grateful it works so well!I believe you will be as well.
5,Sonicare toothbrush,This is the third Sonicare tooth brush I have used these past years. It requires very little maintenance and is quite efficient at promoting oral health. My visits to the dental hygenist reveal minimal amounts of calculus thanks to the Sonicare Essence brush.Philips Sonicare Essence HX5752 Power Toothbrush
4,new to the electric experience,this is my first electric toothbrush...... love it!! feels like a professional cleaning everytime. i like the auto timer feature too. keeps a charge for a long time.
5,Sonicare E-Series Brush,"Been a Sonicare user for years. Going back to the E-series after failures on some of the ""newer and better"" models bought for my wife (the ones including the UV sanitizer) that just stopped working or charging. The E-series seems rock solid. Shipping was very fast.However, a pet peeve. The packaging of the unit was the too typical almost invulnerable sealed plastic. HATE IT! Some day someone is going to manage to cut an artery and die opening one of these packages."
3,Beware the rebate,"I like the toothbrush. However, when I sent in the rebate materials I was told I sent in an invalid Philips' bar code. I was meticulous in my inclusion of the right information and clipped the bar code directly from the box. Satisfied with the toothbrush...unsatisfied with the rebate service."
4,philips sonicare essence hx5752,"I am very well pleased with this product, will not go back to conventional brushing, but does need cleaning after each usage..."
5,recent purchase,"Both my wife and I are very pleased with this toothbrush. I don't notice the problem some people say about the splashing. The price was great and the product is as stated. efficient, easy to use and has a nice design. Philips sent me a full rebate on my purchase of a new head.... it is good for one year.Worth the purchase. I have recommended this to many friends"
5,Great Product!,"I'll keep this quick; this is a fantastic toothbrush. My teeth are noticeably whiter in 2 weeks of use and the feeling you get after you brush is only felt when you leave the dentist. The first time using this product was odd as you are not used to the vibration and the high speed of the brush head, but after a few uses all is well."
5,Sonicare,"We love our new Sonicare Essence e5500! This is our second Sonicare toothbrush, the old one finally giving up after nearly nine years of use by two of us. This new one is lighter weight, gives a signal when to switch positions and even beeps when its time to recharge it. We've taken it on a couple of short trips and the travel case works great. The only improvement we can think of would be for the travel case to hold two heads instead of just one, so you wouldn't have to pack the second one separately. Great product!"
4,"excellent, effective brush, but louder than before","My old, original Sonicare brush died, and since I had such good luck and success with the toothbrush in the past, I got the e5500 as my replacement.Compared to the original Sonicare, the e5500 has some nice improvements: easier to clean charging base, smaller brush-head and slimmer, easier to grip handle. The toothbrush cleans very effectively and I have no reservations in recommending this brush to anyone.My only complaint is that I believe the brush is louder than previous models. Not loud like living by the airport or anything, but loud enough to notice a difference."
5,Fresh from the Dentist Clean,"I haven't had any problems with this toothbrush it's well made and solid. I like the design of the head, it's smaller than a standard toothbrush and as a result can get all around your mouth with no issues. One great feature of the brush are the ends of the bristles, they are rounded not cut flat like other brushes which makes them feel very soft and comfortable when in use. Your mouth doesn't feel as if you've just ingested an entire bowl of crunchberries after you brush and your gums don't get jabbed by the end of the bristles. The unit is completely sealed from getting water inside the mechanism and battery casing, I mean you can't remove a cover it's completely sealed which means you can clean the casing completely -- very sanitary. Use gel toothpaste with it, it makes a big difference in how clean your mouth feels afterward. With the right toothpaste this makes my mouth feel as clean as going to the dentist for a cleaning."
1,Who snatched Page's balls?,"1. Doesnt sound like its Page singing.2. Sounds like 90% of the wimp rock stuff on mtv and the radio.3. Only 2, maybe 3 tops, good songs on the album.Only buy this if your idea of a good time is sitting at home watching trl. This is NOT the Helmet of old, this is basically just crap."
1,"almost...call it ""Undone""","almost bought it...till the clip for drug lord played...not some new helmet fan here, have 'em all, even aftertaste till trade in time came... and i would never fault an artist for experimentation, and i mean never...look at Clutch, a group that proves that musical growth is good, from beginning to end their catalog will stand as testament to real musicianship...and helmet had that...until aftertaste and now this...amongst the ranks of the sadly disappointed i find myself...If this album makes ya happy Page, more power to ya, but thank you for putting that drug lord clip there, you saved me some money..."
2,The Page Hamilton solo project,"I'll be brief about this. It is not a great album. The production and vocals sound very pro-tooly. Aside from that the songs are pretty bland. I think Page has long lost his edge. Helmet was a great band who were unique and recorded some cut rate material. The 2004 Helmet just didn't do it for me. I did give this album a chance too. I downloaded it back in July gave it many a spin. It never gelled. Bottom line, this cd is very annoying and does not provide a worthwhile listening experience.Instead of buying this, pick some fresh music ala Dillinger Escape Plan or Between the Buried and Me."
2,What is this?,"This sounds like Nickelback got together for a Helmet tribute album. Page Hamilton is trying to sound like every other alternacrap singer but with an aggressive twist that just doesn't work at all.There is nothing THAT horrible about this album, but yet there is nothing that good either.It wouldn't be so bad if it was a Page Hamilton solo album. I could just ignore it and everything would have been fine. But calling it a Helmet album is just a plain lie. I don't care what excuse is given as to why Page thinks his new band should be called Helmet. This is not Helmet. Helmet was a really good band that broke up in the late 90's.Other than to listen for reference, you should save your money."
3,"It gets an ""E"" for effort.","One would think that when returning with a studio album for the first time in six or seven years that it would be great. Even when they get Frank Bello from Anthrax and White Zombies former drummer that they would really rock out like Helmet has been known to in the past.Unfortunately it doesn't quite meet up to expectations. This album has a couple of good songs like Unwound and Enenmies. They even sound like the Helmet of old with Speak and Spell, but for some reason this album tends to drag.It's the type of album that you'll get used to by default for listening to it quite often as compared to growing attached to it the first or second listen.Check out Meantime, Betty and Aftertaste. Size Matters is not a better album than Aftertaste."
2,Not that good,"I liked old Helmet, but I wouldn't consider myself a huge fan. I have the CDs, and I enjoy them, but I rarely listen to them. However, since there is so little worth listening to these days, I was excited to hear about a new Helmet CD. The first song made me glad that I had picked up the CD. However, after that it was all downhill. It is just too mellow. I don't expect them to make the same type of music they did a decade ago, but I do expect them to still have some balls. The music is so generic. I couldn't tell when one boring song ends and the next boring song began. When I want mellow, I listen to other types of music besides heavy rock. I don't want to hear hard rock bands doing mellow any more than I want to hear Aimee Mann doing Slayer songs."
2,Small sounds,"The Helmsters begin to remove the shoddy aftertaste of a previous album, though essentially offers, with exception, meandering metal-pop sans enough hairy hooks needed to seal any deals."
4,Standard Helmet format still rocks,"After all these years, Helmet still cranks out some mind numbing, guitar crunching riffs. The album is no mind bender, but worth it for every Helmet fan."
3,"Nice ideas and tips, poor video quality","Bryan shows some very interesting approaches to sound and techniques. Explanation is well done and humor is all over the DVD which is an additional plus.However, video quality is poor and HD would have made this worth 4 stars. But I really enjoyed it anyway :-))"
5,Best on the market,Instantly killed the fleas. Gone in 2 days or less! Will defintiely purchase this product in the future!Note: Beware of Sergeants. Google it.
4,a novel of quiet complexity,"'Jane and Prudence' is what I would call a 'universe' novel, rather than a 'things happen' one. Pym draws one into the quietly complex world of her characters. Jane is a charmingly dithery clergyman's wife, deep in her own literary world and consequently always saying and doing not quite the right thing. There is much irony in this novel, especially in the way characters relate to each other. Pym exposes the petty prejudices and selfish scheming manouvres of ordinary people. Although this is not what you'd call a nail-biter, I found 'Jane and Prudence' very engaging, and a pleasure to read."
4,"Jane, the Matchmaker","This delightful story of two Oxford graduate friends, Jane and Prudence derives much of its humorous charm from Barbara Pym's fondness for stories centred around the Anglican Church. Jane has recently moved with her husband, Nicholas, to the village where he has just become the new vicar. She is very well-intentioned in trying to arrange for her friend, Prudence, to become romantically involved with the recently-widowed Fabian Driver. But a spinster of the parish, Jessie Morrow, is not to be thwarted in her own plans to 'land' Mr Driver. The ensuing intrigue has Pym's usual twists and turns leading to some quaint humour along the way before the matter is resolved."
4,Barbara Pym's Jane and Prudence.,"Apparently one of Pym's early novels, set in the 1950s, largely in an English village, not far from London. The main characters are the local vicar,, newly installed, his wife Jane, and her unmarried friend Prudence, now 29 years old. I liked the picture of village life, the characters are well drawn, and the humor is subtle. It emerges mostly in the account of parish meeting or teas."
1,do these characters like each other?,"I am very surprised at the high praise for this book. I found the language to be awkward and stiff, but the biggest problem for me was the fact that the characters were not likable or believable. There was nothing about Jane and Prudence that made me believe the two of em would be friends, they didn't even seem to like each other. Why on earth would you hook your friend up with someone who is a serial cheater? I was glad it when it was over, even staying up late just to end the misery."
5,Awesome song,"I have loved this song ever since i saw a Music video made for Roswell with Breathing in the background. It is such a good song. I'm so glad it plays on the radio now. If you wanna hear a good song, Buy this single. I have all there Singles plus the CD No name face."
4,refreshing and true to,Very soothing and true to the word lime. Excellent in that regard and the best I've had acquaintance. Even the touch of it onto the palm is pleasing as are the pats. It fades a little faster than most.
5,Great product and my special lovely....loves it!,"As the last reviewer wrote, it's true that this product contains alcohol. As far as I'm concerned though...thank goodness! It has just enough stink to help my neck and face along in the healing process and just enough scent to keep my lovely wanting to kiss me! If you don't like the sting then go w/a facial balm instead. If you understand that the sting = another step in the healing process that is also the ""after"" part of your shave then use it each and every day complimenting it with a nice oil-free moisturizer after your after-shave and your golden! A+++++++++ products from Honeybee and cruelty-free to boot!!!! ((((Win / Win)))"
4,"Great dog cable, great price","I bought this cable about a year ago, and it has been great for my 55 lb shepherd mix. It has been left outside and used on a daily basis. I really like the latch because its very easy to clip onto a collar. I've used tie outs with two other types of latches, and this is the best by far. The others were very difficult to use in cold/snowy weather as they would freeze. I'm only giving this cable 4 stars, because it was broken today by my 65 lb foster dog. Even though it broke, I'm still very pleased with how long this cable has lasted since it has been out in the elements for so long (and besides the foster dog is very strong). I will be ordering this same cable as a replacement."
5,Great tie out,I have used this for the past three years for my two pit bulls and so far it is still in good shape. The plastic has cracked over the years but it still works and I will keep buying these. My dogs use this several times a day for five minutes to an hour at times. It has survived three Alaskan winters as well.
1,BUYER BEWARE !!!,"I got sucked in to buy two MIDLAND CB's that turned out to be a couple of Junky meters instead. Nothing more than ""BAIT & SWITCH."" I'm trying to get my money back while Amazon and Price Pros are playing their own ""blame game."" Now, I have to take the TIME and MILEAGE to SHIP their crap back, while waiting for my Money Back."
1,false advertising,"l bought this thinking it was a radio,may not shop at amazon again,can't take lying"
2,Truthfully speaking,"You join Dr Haledjian the famous crimionlogist as he solves crimes, helps out Inspector Winters and friends. The stories take place in (roughly) the 1950's. The stories are simple and mainly projected at American children.On a personal note: Since i've read the two preceeding books I wasn't impressed with the recycled plot lines."
4,Sixty-three short mysteries where each one had an inconsistent fact that solves the crime,"Dr. Haledjian is a master detective, he is so good that he can scan a crime scene and in a matter of seconds, determine what facts are out of alignment and from that identify the culprit. There are 63 different mysteries involving Dr. Haledjian in the book, each of which is slightly over one page in length. The description of each mystery contains one statement that cannot be true and it is up to you to recognize it. If you cannot see the discrepancy, the solution can be read by turning the page upside down. The level of difficulty of the mysteries is appropriate for middle school children, so this book can provide an hour or two of good mystery fun."
1,Not worth reading...scam book,Don't waste your time on this book....everything in it is something we pretty much knew already. It's a book that just repeats itself over and over.
3,Not what I expected,"I thought that since this book was for idiots it would be very basic have many easy crafts. Instead I found many of the projects to be a little intimidating. I never took shop, so I'm not into building birdhouses, and I have no interest in cutting metal with a three year old. The drawings and lack of color weren't too inspiring either. Many of the craft require equipment that I don't have, nor do I wish to purchase.I found Family Fun Crafts by Deanna Cook to be a much better book for smaller children (and for me) - colorful, fun, and as easy or as difficult as you care to make it."
5,Fun projects for kids,This book has a lot of fun things for young folks or old folks...keeps 'em busy.
2,unfortunate attempt by theorist to reach broader audience,"Don Wittman has written several academic papers challenging many of the basic results in Public Choice that government intervention is inefficient and democracy is dominated by special interests and rent-seekers. His theoretical models are very involved and difficult to follow.This book represents an attempt to discuss his main points without the use of hard-core models and notation. He fails. Wittman makes many broad sweeping statements, then repeatedly states he has just proven something, when it was nothing more than a statement. And not very convinving.This is a shame, as he plays a very important role in offering counters to traditional public choice theory dominated by libertarian ideology. But his arguments here are just not convincing."
1,Not Worth It,"This product was not only difficult to figure out how to go about playing the game, but it just plain did not work. It would scan an item once fine, then the next item it would not work. I would say 85% of items with bar codes it never accepted. It just did not work and was a waste of money."
4,"Good, could be better","This is a great coffee table book for anyone interested in computer history. Each page (or group of pages) deals with systems from the Amstrad to the Zenith. The book is full of great giant full color, and very beige, photos.I felt this book could have been better in dealing with industrial computer design, it barely touches anything after the early 90s. Great computer designs like the Compaq LCD presarios and the 20th anniversary Mac get no coverage. I also thought, when I bought it, that it would go a lot more into overall computer design than just specific systems."
2,What? No Kaypro?,"After looking in the online table of contents and index and seeing absolutely no mention of Kaypro Corporation (aka Non-Linear Systems) I would never buy this book! Kaypro introduced the first successful hard-disk portable, the Kaypro 10. They also introduced the world's first true laptop, the Kaypro 2000. Not even to mention the original Kaypro 2, one of the very first successful portables, which was so successful that it helped put Osborne out of business! Also not to mention that Kaypro introduced the very first IBM PC/AT (286) clone, at a fraction of the cost of the IBM. If these facts don't qualify them as a significant pioneer computer company, I don't know what does."
4,"Nice photos, flawed text","The photos are the star of this book, and it's worth it for them. They're clear high resolution photos, and usually there are closeups of the interesting parts of the systems. There are errors, though: an Apple ][+ photo is used instead of an original Apple ][, for instance. Also, the description of how a 6510 differs from a 6502 is incorrect.Much like AppleDesign, enjoy the photos but don't trust the text."
2,"Pretty pictures, worthless text","It's riddled with errors and shows every sign of having been copied from websites or other sources that were not authoritative themselves. All sorts of rumors mixed in with fact, and no effort to distinguish between them. Also, curiously, though the book contains lovely photographs of all the machines it discusses, Laing never shows any of them turned on or running software. A missed chance, I think."
5,Beautiful Pictures,"Perfect pictures of your favourite microcomputers of the eighties. Apple II, ZX80, Spectrum, Amstrad, even the NeXT Cube are here, beautifully photographed both with clear orthogonal views as well as with a three-quarter view. These are the pictures of these machines that you wanted to see. You can clearly see all of the case, including the underside if I/O ports exist there. The text is interesting enough though in some cases the precise machine photographed might not be the exact machine described. (Though the Amiga 500 is clearly labelled as such so there is no dishonesty here.)Since I bought this book everyone who has viewed is has practically drooled over it. Throw away your National Geographics and your art books - *this* is the book you need to have on your coffee table!My only complaint is that ink from some pages seems to be making slight marks on the opposing pages. But it's not a big deal."
2,Somewhat Worthless,"I find this video to be pretty much useless. The arpeggio section is pretty much a waste of time, since he plays the same arpeggio but in different positions over and over. He doesn't offer much in terms of licks, mainly just how to move up and down scales\arpeggios using his approach. You do get to see him play live, which is a treat because he is so fluid. The last lick pretty much sums up the whole video, I would not even bother with the rest. So I would recommend staying away from this and maybe just finding some licks on the net."
2,"OK video, but guy looks like a women in Mel Gibsons body","he's a good player, but hes one of the ugliest people ive ever seen."
3,The movie will most likely be better scripted...,The concept of this book rocks. But the writing was kind of weak as well as some of the parts of the story loosely fall apart. Give it a whirl if you are looking for something light to read.
4,Interesting Once You Get Into the Point of View,"As a noir/horror type of book, ""The Speed Queen"" isn't being as clever as you think. As a first person narrative, it's being VERY clever - well worth the read.The book's narrator, one member of a trio of robbers who went on a killing spree, is dictating a list of answers to questions about her crime. O'Nan takes some big risks with the character and (mostly) manages to pull them off - especially the character's attempts at deceiving her future biographer as well as also deceiving herself. There are a few gaps in credibility in the book - the number of women on death row, the husband's fixation with 70's punk and garage rock. However, it all seems to fit, especially the rhythm of the narrative."
4,intense,I really liked this book. The beginning I was a little confused on where it was going but once you got over that it got really good and intense. Quick read too.
2,Not his best work,"I picked up this book because I had read ""The Names of the Dead"" and found it a very affecting work about the Viet Nam war, a topic of too few good novels. This one is just not up to the same standard. Karla Faye Tucker meets Stephen King... it's like the TV movies that come out within a week of some sensational tabloid crime. I was not lead to care very much about Marjorie, or anyone else in this book. Nor was I lead to understand her. If, as she says, she accepted Jesus into her life, I am hard put to see how. This book is a gripping page-turner, but definitely ""summer reading"". If you really wanted to see into the life and heart of a killer, read Norman Mailer's ""The Executioner's Song"" about Gary Gilmore, and then read the devastating ""Shot in the Heart"" by Gary's brother Mikal."
2,Stop the car! I think I'm gonna puke...,"I must make a confession. While ""speeding"" through the bookstore, I snatched up O'Nan's book thinking it might be something I could recommend for my book club. And I thought my Diet Pepsi was flat! Nothing could compare to this book. Classic American Noir? Gag me with a foot-long cheese coney. Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing ""Gainey""."
1,Oh give it up already!,"I too wandered upon this book with the impressive recommendations. Too bad, it was predictable and BORING. Tries to be Natural Born Killers but fails miserably. One more homage to Stephen King and even he must be gagging..."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed my first Stewart O'Nan book.,"Reading ""The Speed Queen"" was like actually being inside the head of an alcoholic/drug addicted killer.I laughed at the macabre humor and loved the premise of the book that the last confession was being made to Stephen King. I will be looking for more books by Stewart O'Nan in the future"
1,Utter Garbage,"This video is horrible and in fact, utter garbage. Poorly produced, poorly executed. Don't waste a nickle on this video."
3,"Pretty Good at the Beginning, but Kind of Boring Later on.","This book was pretty good. It starts off very interesting, and gets interesting farther down, but towards the end, I kind of lost interest. It gets kind of boring and maybe a little confusing. The characters were pretty good, though. Still worth it if you like historical fiction."
1,This book put me to sleep!,I thought this book was a snore because it was very slow. The characters weren't really that believable either. There wasn't much action or suspense and nothing to hook you. I DEFINATELY don't recommend this book at all!
1,"A good begining, but boring as you go along.",The Root Cellar is a book that refers back to the Civil war. The book starts off good but becomes very boring. It is a disapointing book. Has a bad ending.
4,The Root Cellar,"The Root Cellar begins with Rose. She is 12 years old and orphaned due to her grandmother's passing. Rose has no other family that can take her. She must go live in Canada with an aunt who she has never met. Rose feels very lonely in her aunt's chaotic household. While looking for a quiet place , Rose finds a root cellar. When Rose comes out of it, she is on the same farm during the 1800's. Rose meets Will and Susan while she is there and quickly befriends them. Will goes off to fight in the Civil War. Rose and Susan go to Washington to try to find Will because they have not heard from him.Janet Lunn did a good job tying the history and fiction together. She keeps the reader interested in the history, and she also makes you want to know what is going to happen to the characters. Janet Lunn also touches on the aspect of losing people and forming new relationships. This book is good and interesting."
4,One of the better time travel stories,"I read this some years ago, but I remember I really enjoyed it. After a while, I find that time-travel stories tend to be simialar, but this is one I really enjoyed. After I read it, I gave it to my sister, and I know she enjoyed it just as much as I did. After that we started over. I haven't read it since then, and as I said, that was a couple of years ago, but I would definetly recommend this to some one who is around the age of ten and appreciates books like this."
3,Not the best book i read but not the worst!!,I read The Root Cellar in school and i have to say that it's strong point was at the beginning. But it was very informative about the Civil War. I didn't think that that was the best ending the author chose and it could have been a little more exciting but it wasn't that bad!
3,We thought it was a good book but it was hard to believe.,"We thought it was a good book,but hard to believe. Rose,the main character,has quite an adventure going back to the time of the Civil War,but realizes she prefers to live in her own time."
5,"Outstanding, a must get CD.","If you want a feel good,relaxing,yet moving CD, then this is the one for you. Each track is unique and stirring. I love it. It is very well arranged and instrumented. Kudos to those contibuting on this project."
4,Emotion filled,"overall an excellent cd. I really liked 9 of the 11 songs. That alone is saying something for me.There are very few cd's I find 3 to 5 songs that I enjoy listening to. I have found zero songs to enjoy on many more.Obviously,I'm not an expert in the smooth jazz field of music but please take a listen...you just may like this cd."
5,get your chops back,this is perfect for a guitarist who has wants to get back into a great routine after not playing for an extended period of timeI bought and recommend all Frank Gambale's published work.Only funny thing is the 80's hair and wordrobe.
5,Great DVD for those who want a good practice plan,"Actually, I purchased the VHS some years ago along with some of Frank's other releases. I have to say that this has become an invaluable tool for my technical practice....and that's what it's for. It's not meant to be a 'beginner's video' or a 'let me teach you' video. It is meant solely as an excercise/workout video for intermediate to advanced guitarists. It maps out a good practice plan for you, based on the things that Frank himself practices. It's a must if you're a player looking for a more organized 'technical' practice routine."
3,"Almost too real; Fighting time, weather and fire","I have been fighhting wildland fire for over 30 years as a volunteer and as a park ranger. This game is so realistic that it could actually be considered a ""simulator"" for training fire scene managers. All the elements are accurately portrayed; Weather, changing wind speed and direction, equipment and manpower problems, budgets, etc. You can play the game from an overview pespective, or get right down on the ground with the grunts and dozer operators. It is not an easy game, and after six months, I am only into the third (of nine)level scenarios. Emphasis is on planning and deploying resources for the best effect. May be too accurate, and therefore too slow for gamers used to ""shoot-em up"" type, rapid action. Note to parents: It is possible to loose firefighters to the flames. May be too intense for some children."
2,Wasted for Hockney,"Unfortunately,I think many viewers will find this video a waste of their time. I think most of us have known someone that was delusional and wasted their life trying to do or be someone famous, well if so, sadly you will find the same elements in this ""artist's"" life. The video is clear and crisp and perhaps the best part of the ""movie"" is scenes of NYC and LA. Why this guy thought Hockney would be impressed with his art is hard to understand, just about everything that Hockney has done in the last 60 years is the anthesis of Pappa's ""8"" years of drawing a pencil portrait of Marilyn Monroe. The film deals a lot with the support and love his parents gives him while he continues his delusions, sound familiar? Hockney fan's should stay away from this movie, there is nothing there that is Hockneysque except his derogatory comments about another derivitive work from a photograph."
2,Gritty psychological movie,"Some people like the gritty feel of movies that are more along the lines of normal life. This movie, through what I'd heard, was a vampire movie. Not so. What it is is a movie representing a psychiatrist who receives as a patient a mortal girl, not a vampire, who enjoys drinking blood, and shows his attempts to treat said girl. It is complicated by improper doctor-patient relationship with the girl's mother, and has a disturbing ending that keeps you thinking, if you can get that far, but it has too much of the feel of normality for my taste. Not a bad movie if you like that sort, as this is something that could easily happen in the real world. I much prefer the more fantastical styles rather than psychiatric for my ""vampire"" movies. Again, there are no vampires in this movie, just a girl with vampiric tendencies."
1,don't waste your time on this converter,"I have IBM ThinkPad laptop T40 which I wanted to use together w/ the converter. For me this combination did not work - the converter did not transfer picture to TV in 90% of cases when I restarted my laptop. Even when it worked, I was not able to resize picture on TV.I returned it."
1,KWorld KW-PCTV,DOES NOT WORK. Connected to my Dell PC and never worked. Verified my monitor output worked with a regular monitor. Connected the unit properly and returned the unit for another. Neither worked. Went the their website which was useless
1,No HDTV yet,"Can not get the device to output useable HDTV, only a standard NTSC signal. Very disappointing. No user manual, so I am reduced to pushing buttons and hoping I stumble on the correct settings. Hope to get a response from KWorld."
3,"Drop the rap and stick to rock, TFK.",I discovered this album after looking at Art Of Breaking and Phenomenon. I don't like it quite as much as those two because the lead singer doesn't rap very well. But when these guys are rockin' out they're awesome!
4,My kinda music.,"Thousand foot krutch gives an increadible performance, giving us the very best of the top forty, without any pop. ""When in doubt"" and ""Come Along"", show they can punk rock with the best of them, ""Small Town"" and ""Lift it"", displays their skills at mellow, Matchbox 20 style rock. ""Up comes down"" tells us they can be just as heavy as anyone elso on Mtv or Much. ""Supafly"" show Trever McNevan can RAP! This is perhaps my favorite CD in my collection. So why the four stars? I'm afraid that these guys are trying too hard to sound like everyone else. I could be wrong, but I have to give an honest review."
1,this cd [is bad],this has to be one of the worst cds out there... when that [person]of a lead vocalist tries to rap its like me stickin my head ... and trin to talk it dosent make for good vocals lyrics or sound. there supposed to be considered a christian band but i didnt hear the word god or jesus at all give me a break if ur called cristian music sing about bein a cristian ...
4,:),"This is the best album/band noones ever heard of.This is the most underrated bands EVER ( Including FM Static. ) And they deserve some appreciation. This CD is a great rock CD and it has a bit of seemingly Hip-Hop bits here and there in just about every song. Almost every song on this CD rocks, so BUY IT!"
2,gonna have to disagree here...,"This album should get a 5/10. It's very mediocre. Despite being diverse, it really doesn't pull off any one style well. The rap lyrics are pretty bad. I really liked their latest record, so I decided to check this one out. You can tell that they were young when they cut this record and their songwrting skills were not truly honed yet. The early EP tracks at th end of the disc are horrible. As a whole, you may find something to like on here, but I recommend their other cds over this."
1,AVOID THIS VERSION!!,"Do not buy this, the EastWestDVD version of Dark Places (and Horror Express). This is a disgustingly cheap transfer from video (yes they have taken an old vhs copy as their source). It is pan-and-scan, blurry, utterly horrible. What a disgrace to see a Don Sharp movie treated in this manner. Oh, but nice packaging - EastWest must have absolutely no decency. Shame on that outfit for peddling this unspeakable travesty."
2,deflated,"I'd seen this movie years ago and liked it, for that time, so....imagine my delight when I found the DVD in a discount bin! Thinking I'd found a treasure, I scooped it up and couldn't wait to get home to view it. After doing so, I was disappointed. If I hadn't read the book, I'd never had known it was set in Paris. No one even tried to ""be French.""On the technical side, the DVD's sound is poor.For what it is, it's ok, but I recommend sticking with the book. After all, you can never really improve on the original..."
3,Scared the beejus out of me,"I saw this when it aired back in 1986 I was 12 at the time, I was scared out of my mind! I had nightmares for years after watching this movie."
2,MONKEY BUSINESS,"Edgar Allan Poe's classic detective story has been filmed so many times that the identity of the murderer is known before you watch the film. So the key ingredient in a successful translation of this story is how well it is presented. Unfortunately, this made for TV production is so methodically dull, no suspense can be generated, and the final scenes become unintentionally hilarious. Directed with little imagination by NIGHT GALLERY stalwart Jeannot Szwarc, MURDERS offers us George C. Scott in a painfully inept performance as the disgraced detective; a young Val Kilmer strutting his stuff in a completely useless role; and Rebecca DeMornay as Scott's level-headed and spirited daughter. Emmy winner Ian McShane (Deadwood) plays Scott's nemesis, the precept responsible for Scott's disgraceful banishment from the force. The murders are staged haphazardly and the whole production is ultimately embarrassing to all involved. Fans of Poe's story will be disappointed in this lifeless movie."
3,Sadly Contrived and Gimmicky,"When I saw George C. Scott's name my expectations for the movie increased, usually Scott turns in a convincing performance and this was what I expected from him this time too. Although his presence made a contribution to the overall effect, it could not help pull this one out of the fire. There are altogether too many contrived ""scary moments"" in this one used to influence viewer perceptions and try and create the necessary atmosphere of mystery and suspense.The characters are all too frequently overdone with exaggerated responses that really go over the top. There are a few good moments but they are more than offset by the larger number of overdone, overacted moments. I watched the entire movie with some interest but found the exceedingly contrived ending to be almost unbearable. I will not say more but heartily recommend watching this movie before you buy it. I do not regret having seen it once but have no desire to see it again."
3,A MEDIOCRE INTERPRETATION,"Thank God the movie was set in Paris, because the dialogue was a travesty. Rebecca De Mornay's character, in particular, spoke in modern idiom, as did Val Kilmer's, occasionally. Coupled with insipid delivery, De Mornay's effort was painfully unconvincing. The quantity of spattered blood was similarly off-putting. Nevertheless, George C. Scott's performance was adequate, and the architectural and period details were convincing."
4,Farewell to the New Class,"Seasons 6 and 7 remind me a lot of season 2 in that they did not have a definitive male star on the show. Season 1 pushed the Scott character as the leading male character and Seasons 3-5 had Ryan Parker as their male star. These two seasons could not make up there minds on which male character to highlight as their star, much like season 2 in my opinion. Despite that these seasons had their fair share of memorable moments and did a fine job of closing out the series. I recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of any season of Saved by the Bell: The New Class."
2,"No ""play all"" feature","I own every saved by the bell disc set except New Class Season 2...This is the only season that doesn't have a ""Play All episodes"" feature...So you can only watch 1 episode at a time and then you have to select the next episode with the remote. This is a deal breaker for me as I watch it on my computer when I go to sleep. Such a trivial feature to be abandoned."
1,LET THIS BE THE END,"Could this show have possibly had 7 seasons?! I honestly believe that if the show went for 60 more years, Dustin Diamond would still be a cast member. Spare yourself this terd and just buy the series with the original cast."
5,Raven,"The book was very informative about the cult that Jim Jones had. He was a monster in my opinion. He took advantage of the poor,sick,helpless people. He had them take their own lives,and if they refused they were forced to anyhow. Jim Jones was one sick man that should have lived and stood trail for all those deaths he caused."
5,Exceptional Read,"""Raven"" is, without a doubt, the seminal work on Jim Jones and Jonestown. Written by Tim Reiterman, who was injured during the massacre that killed Sen Ryan, this book is researched, factual, and fair. Anyone wanting to understand the workings of Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple need only to pick up a copy of this book.One warning. It is approximately 600 pages, and impossible to put down once you pick it up. So make sure to clear your calendar for a few days before starting it. Once read, this book will remain with you for a lifetime.Bravo, Mr Rieterman."
2,"Great book, Kindle edition not so hot","This book is amazing. It's well-written, thorough, and has buckets of citations to support what it claims. Great. I give the content five stars.Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is lousy. The chapter advance feature doesn't work. Neither does the index, which is just a long list of items in the book with no links and no location numbers. So you can page through the index but you can't get to anything. This means that navigating through the book is kind of a pain.Publishers charge a lot for Kindle books, and they ought to at least have someone check them to make sure that they work properly."
4,"20,000 Words - Purchase Review","Very pleased with my purchase from this vendor. While the item was listed as ""previously used"" it was in fine (I would even say excellent) condition and I was overall pleased with the purchase. I would definitely order from this vendor again."
4,"Thanks to the Stuart story, I bought and kept this book!","Anne Stuart is an unique author! She makes any plot feasible and realistic. Ms. Carrol's story is good also. And, I've liked Ms. Thompson in this story as well as others. However, the only one worth rereading is Ms. Stuarts."
1,Very Confusing!,"First, if you are not aware there is a Toni award winning musical by the same name that has been on & off Broadway since the early 70's. Thinking this was the same story in book form, I was VERY disappointed to find out that it wasn't. I didn't even finish the book. That's how much I liked it. Not worth the money."
3,A Marc Bolan tribute,"Upon my first listen I found myself irritated by Danielz' Marc Bolan impression. It just seemed too over the top and exaggerated. Being a true blue T.Rex fan since 1972 maybe I was a bit biased *s*After reading the other reviews though I thought I should give this album another shot and I'm glad I did. Danielz (aka John Willans) does a pretty good job of covering Marc's songs but what does it for me are his original songs. I've always loved 'Baby Factory' and now I can add 'Voice From a Silent Heart'. Truly a beautiful offering to Marc. I've found myself playing that one over and over.All in all I can't really criticize any of the songs on this album, they are all good covers. I hope after hearing this album that more people will be turned on to Marc's music and will check out the real thing :-)"
3,NOT a light romp!,"The cover and title of this novel, and even the first couple of chapters, make it seem like a story in the vein of Spider Robinson. But it gets dark-- very dark, and pretty sad. While he was writing this, Brust must have been having romantic troubles or something, because the novel is very cynical and pessimistic about love and the relationship between men and women.All in all, the novel was a downer, and the conclusion didn't seem to merit the sacrifices I had to make along the way. Much more bitter than sweet."
2,I Need a Drink,"As it turns out, this book has a somewhat-interesting plot involving time travel and the deliberate destruction of Earth and other human-inhabited planets.However, I doubt many readers will make it through the first hundred or so pages where nothing happens. Well, the characters hang out in the bar and grill, drink, smoke, play Irish music, and obsess about their love lives. The dour first person narration by ""Billy"" does nothing to develop the characters; they are just a list of names and whiskey preferences."
1,Grr,"It took every ounce of effort to finish this one. I was stuck on page 115 for about three weeks and finally it was either throw it away or finish. I finished, it was painful in parts, slightly entertaining in others. It was just very hard to read. (And you must endure constant Irish folk music descriptions every few pages that add nothing to the book.) So now that it is finished it is in the recycle bin. I am much relieved."
1,Umm...,"I'm 23... I get bored when EVERYONE has the "" may care"" attitude that allows them to not ask questions about what's going on (and go outside when they know that could mean death).I'm halfway through. I will finish this book, but I don't know why. I was hoping it would be funny... instead it seems to be about a bunch of BORING slackers who obsess about substandard music and food."
4,"A Solid, Even Entertaining History","Ienaga Saburo has an argument to make and he does so with great intensity. As a liberal, he lambasts the extreme nationalist government and addresses in detail the indoctrination that took place in the Japanese school system. Ienaga was a child during this time and he even reports a few of his own personal experiences from the classroom. His enthusiasm is such, however, that the reader will run into colorful phrases such as ""the chilling frost of state indoctrination.""This book was originally published in Japan and is very much from a Japanese viewpoint. This is immediately made clear by the fact that Ienaga begins in 1931 with the beginning of hostilities in China rather than the usual 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor. This book sheds a new light on World War II for an American public used to our interpretation of the war. It is a good history by a highly opinionated author."
5,NICE STRONG LOOKING HOSES,"I gave these five stars because they are nice strong looking hoses. I ordered two hoping they would fit my Algreen 81002 Agua 50-Gallon rain water collection systems. they were the right length and I needed a couple of spares.Unfortunately they didn't fit. The Algreen hoses were 1cm larger, when I measure round the hose. I couldn't screw the part (that screws on) because it was already in use and the barrel was full. I could tell by looking at it, that it was much larger than the one in use.I sent them back last week, I had to pay over $5 for postage, but it was my fault for ordering them. Next time, I think I'll get in touch with Algreen and see if I can buy some from them. I haven't seen any short hoses locally. If anyone reading this has any ideas I'll appreciate any advice."
4,NEEDS WASHER to work,"These work for the purpose I bought them, but what a pain to have to run to the store and buy washers for them. I bought five of them."
5,Great utility hose for laundry areas,Bought this hose to use in the laundry area as an extension from the laundry tub. It makes it a lot easier to clean stuff without having to pick them up and put them in the laundry tub. I make wine and it is perfect for rinsing our the fermenting tubs and carboys without having to pick them up and put them in the sink. Also able to use it to fill and clean my carpet cleaner on the ground without having to pick it up over the sanitary tubs.
3,prism stylus P.2 power kite,I got 2 of them and I fly them together. I just have to wait for the right wind to fly them together.
5,Wood Wise Screamin' Hog Plus Javalina Game Call,"Item was brand new still in package, I purchased this item and me and my son went to the lease that weekend and he brought his hog caller with him. He started calling about 4:45p.m. and by 6:00P.M. we had a pack of javalinas heading straight towards our caller. I think the item works great and worth the money."
1,Hunter's Heart,The plot and story line were sketchy at best and hard to follow at times. I had a hard time getting interested in the story. I do not recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
1,hunter's heart,very hard to follow plot and storyline. could not stay interested. would not recommend to anyone looking for a good read
1,Hunter's Heart,story line hard to follow and plot was sketchy at best. would not recommend to anyone looking for a good read.
2,Not Worth It,"Disappointed with this product. Mode switches are cheap and flimsy. It's not rated for wet environments (i.e. outdoor use). This Fluke ""test set"" is barely different than a standard line powered slimline phone. The big deal is that it's one piece, has clip leads to connect to the phone line and a polarity LED. It costs $85. If you can deal with slight inconvenience you can buy a standard slimline phone for under $10 (right here on Amazon) and solder on test clips to the phone's input line. If you're even more technically savvy, you can solder an LED and resistor to get the polarity feature. So for about $15 you have the same diagnostic capability. I use Fluke meters all the time and the quality is generally first rate. This test set does not measure up."
4,Satisfied customer,"The product was all that I wanted. However, I really had to wait for it! Slow delivery."
5,Buy this Book!,"This is an excellent book! It's very hard to put down. Brian uses references, charts, and graphs that a person like me can understand. I'm not the most knowlegdeable in this part of the computer field, but this book is giving all the tools needed to understand and build on the knowledge presented in this book. It has been most helpful to me because I've taken a huge step in my career from a desktop technician to Enterprise support. The knowledge I need to be successful is contained in this book. It has been approved overwhelmingly by my boss and others who have looked at it.. I greatly suggest buying this book..you will not be dissapointed"
5,"Well made, cute sign","I purchased this as a gift. It is well-constructed and exceeded my expectations. It will be used for years to come for our ""Nana""."
2,It *does* anti-fog....,"Well, this product *does* anti-fog, as long as you coat your goggles every day and don't swim for more than 45 minutes. But something tells me that there's some MacGyver vinegar/baking soda formula that will work just as well."
3,Not the item pictured!,"I have looked all over for the tool pictured and was very disappointed when I opened the package and saw this KD Tools 2071. I need the tool pictured to repair the flare where the pipe attaches to the manifold. I do not see this one being capable of that job.This tool is the same expander you see everywhere else to make slip fit joints and the directions say turn one cone around to make it flare. The bars that contact the pipe are straight and flat unlike the one pictured. Buyer beware.All that said it looks to be well made for an ordinary expander fitting 1 1/2 - 2 1/2"" pipes but pricey for what you get.Update - ToolTopia has been great to deal with I would definitely recommend them based on their excellent customer service."
5,car tool,"I didn't get to get my husband a Christmas present so when I won the gift card I let him choose what he wanted. This was one of the gifts he chose and he really likes it. He's a retired mechanic and he still likes to work on vehicles, and can always use another tool."
5,Wonderful Read,"'A Murder For Her Majesty', deals with a young girl who witnesses the murder of her father and must deal with men who conspire to murder her in turn. The novel is a wonderful combination of suspense and heart; Alice Tuckfield's journey in discovering who she is and where she belongs as well as all the people she encounters along the way will appeal to all readers of all ages. The book is well-written and extremely fast-paced, a great solution for boredom and leaving readers wishing for a sequel."
5,One of the best books in the world,"I read Murder for Her Majesty in fifth grade for the first time and I've read it dozens of times since then, for the past ten years. It's the best book when you're looking for a relaxing and exciting read."
1,Very Disappointed,"Wow, I hate to go against the tide but I felt very strongly about this book and unfortunately, not positively. I read this book aloud to my 13 year old daughter as part of our homeschool curriculum and both of our general impressions of this book were similarly negative to the point that we were glad to reach the last page and be done with it. We both found the book to be poorly written, the plot to be extremely predictable, the character development to be lacking, the dialog of the characters and the plot line to be unrealistic,the character motivations to be unclear and the historical inaccuracies to be glaring. The plot was clearly contrived from the very beginning to the end. At the final page we were relieved to be through but frustrated that we wasted our time and confused as to all the loose ends left by the author. I certainly would not personally recommend this book."
2,a disappointment,"I had been looking forward to reading this book as Sonlight Curriculum usually picks excellent works. This book was such a disappointment that I didn't even finish it, however. The story runs too much like a Disney movie with a great deal of predictableness. As for use with Sonlight, I did not find this book added a great deal of understanding about the time period, which is what I seek in good children's literature. I also found that the author was so sensitive about having a girl stay with boys (something I would also be) that she made it a little too obvious that she was uncomfortable with the situation. This left the story constantly trying to make things ""look right"". I would not recommend this book."
4,"Very good, though a little bit predictable.","A very good book. The plot was clever and kept you reading. Even though sometimes you could predict what was going to happen next, I liked it alot."
2,can't get rid of chemical smell,i have not used this product yet and probably won't. I will continue to use the one i already had as it fits my table and doesn't smell. I did as Olfa said to do about the smell. Washed them several times in vinegar and water (mostly vinegar)and left outside on patio thinking that might help but the smell is not as strong but still stinks.
4,BUSY PEOPLE DIABETIC COOKBOOK,"This book was easy to understand, told of diabetes, as well as having excellent receipes and short ones as well. NO need to buy alot of ingredients. very well done i would recommend this book to anyone with diabetes"
5,Excellent Stuff,This is a great cookbook. It has great recipes and I love this author. I have several of her cookbooks and use them all the time.
2,"Acceptable, but don't waste your money","This book has a couple of useful recipes, but too much sugar and too many carbs.However, more important, the religious overtones - primarily in the opening chapters - completely undermine the authority of the authors. The blatant suggestion to ""pray rather than treat"" is both insulting and dangerous. In addition, the link to some fly-by-night religious help group is irritating. Praying about your condition might make you feel better, but when my health is at stake I go to a Medical professional rather than making a wishful appeal to an imaginary helper in the sky.There are better, and more credible books out there."
4,"Brilliant sound with an external microphone,The internal microphone is garbage, the effects are garbage. I absolutly love it.","Like i said, the internal microphone is garbage. At the very least buy a Sony ECM-MS907 digital stereo microphone. Then it will sound wonderful. Also get a 4 gig compact flash, or forget getting a whole show at 24 bit (got mine for 220 on ebay). The effects are absolutly useless. But the sound quality with the better microphone makes up for it all.The size, and quality of sound with external microphone is all its about. Everything else is garbage. But Thats ALL I care about. Its great and all my musician performer friends are jealous. Also, with my mp3 mode, on the 4 gig flash card, I can record 32 hours of rehersal without stopping. Try to beat that."
3,Good but a bit clunky,Does what it says well - I like the in-built stereo mic which saves mesing around with external mics and cables most of the time. I very much like having a recording level dial - much better than most minidisc recorders where guesswork is normally needed to set the level. I like the effects and the half speed feature.If I have to be critical the looks and engineering quality of the unit seems a little antiquated compared to IPODs and current MP3 players and the like. As mentioned by someone else you can name tracks but the names are not carried over when you transfer the files to a PC which means you end up searching through your tracks for the right one.
3,Only Good For Small Holes,Package says it can repair holes up to Quarter size. Nope. Still need a drywall patch for that. Think of this as putty on a stick. That's all it is.
1,Don't waste your money!,What a mess! Go to your local hardware store and buy a tub of lightweight spackle - half the price and much easier to use!
3,"Did the job, awkward packaging","Definitely does a great job filling holes, the mixture is great. The packaging on the other hand, horrible. I received by deodorant-like Erase-a-hole and most of the putty was in the cap. Not sure if it was old product or what, but I dug it out with my fingers and applied it. Not a horrible experience, but an experience that I wasn't expecting."
5,Worked great,Repaired all the dozens of small holes in my apartment in less than an hour. Had a couple of larger holes that took a couple of applications but the product handled it with ease. It dries white so I didn't even need to repaint!
1,Fish won't touch it.,"I have two cardinalfish, two clownfish, and five damsels, one of them 6"" long, who is a ravenous eater. Most have been in my tank for more than 4 years; the tank has been healthy for more than a decade. I feed them a varied diet, including dried crustaceans. Each one seems to have preferred foods, but they all eat whatever I put in, except the small cardinalfish who is newest. I have used Tetra (not this product) in the past with good results. My fish will not touch the Tetra Jumbo Krill whether I put it in whole or broken up. If anybody could explain to me how to make it interesting to them (assuming it's wholesome), I'd be interested."
4,Cold Fire review,"I thought that the book Cold Fire was a great book. It had a lot of everything that I am looking for in a book mystery, suspense, and romance, things that will not normally physically happen in the ""real world"". The fact that what happens is going on in the book with saving peoples live with a slight mixture of romance, and mystery all in the same book. Dean R. Koontz puts everything in such a great spot so that it makes the whole story flow awesome. Koontz puts you right in the book with the characters and you feel scared when the characters do. I would defiantly suggest this book to anybody who has read his books before or are looking for something new; this would be a great book to read."
5,"Confusing, exciting, and all around spine tingling!!!",I have read almost all of Mr. Koontz's books. I have always loved how decriptive he can be. It's like watching a movie without the screen. I enjoyed the characters and thier heroing experiences. The twist with the aliens threw me way off track. I didnt know where the story or characters would end up. This book kept me excited the whole way through. Koontz is one of the best.
1,Terrible,Terrible book. the story was way dragged out. Very boring. I had to fast forward throughout the book. Now I came to almost the end and the ending seems quite a let down. Not sure if I should even finish it.
2,Not one of Koontz's best efforts,"This book gets off to a great start but after the first 150 pages the plot dwindles down to something less than expected from the imagination of Mr. Koontz. I was disappointed with the book's last chapters: they seemed like something from another author and lacked substance. I found myself not really caring about the main characters by the end. I'm glad this wasn't my first Koontz, or it may have been my last."
4,"Yessir, I Like It","This is the first Koontz novel I've read, and I definately want to read his others. This story mixes different genres. It's a horror novel, a mystery, a thriller, and a drama. The first half, I thought, was more exciting than the second, but by the end, you realize it's a story about human condition and what it takes to heal old wounds. I didn't think the ending was far out there, like someone on this board said. It makes perfect sense. I'm glad I read this, and I think you will be too."
5,A Great Fire,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A weakness in some of Koontz's books has been his lack of character development. This time he hits gold with his two main characters. They are very well-rounded characters. The hero is incredibly brave and sexy and yet he is quite vulnerable. The woman is his perfect match. The chemistry between these two is the primary reason I enjoyed this book. The plot is exceptional. Better than I expected. I enjoyed trying to find out why the hero is able to save others. The ending was satisfying. I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys romance, suspense and horror."
1,Done With Dean,"I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him. This is not the case with this book. ""Cold Fire"" is absolutely horrible. I so regret purchasing this book. It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.Just on a side note, ""The Bad Place"" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining."
1,Already forgotten,"Another forgotten and not-exciting item in Koontz range. I had read it when I still had the hope that Koontz would be a real writer but this was the last attempt and I left him in the prcoss.I don't remember it much except that as usual there was a man and there was a woman and they met somewhere and tried to save something against something which is not memorable in the least. The same summary is applicable to: Watchers, Srangers, Dark Rivers of the Heart, House of Thunder, By the Light of the Moon..pufff.I don't remember this meaty thing and is there anyone? It is forgotten long time ago though it was published recently. Pity for trees."
4,Loved the premise,"I'm a sucker for reluctant heroes and this one fits the bill, at least for the first half of the book. It slips a little bit. I loved Jim Ironheart and would enjoy a sequel to this as he and Holly become a dynamic duo, so to speak.**Spoiler Alert!!!**What I didn't believe was Holly's instant and complete love for Jim. It was just too quick and felt forced. I would have liked a slower build up to the love. The premise itself was very cool and I love the idea that Jim could do all that with his mind. Overall, it was an enjoyable read."
2,"This time, Koontz tries too hard but fails.","You can usually count on Koontz to deliver a suspenseful novel with well written, three dimensional characters. But in ""Cold Fire"" the suspense is lacking. There are some pretty spectacular sequences but they're not integreted into the story in a way that makes them suspenseful.Koontz creates characters with depth, that are psychologically believable, and this is one of the things that sets him apart from many other suspense novelists and is one of the things I used to like him for. But this time, he's taking it way too far, and combines it with some supernatural elements that never feels believable.""Cold Fire"" is a disappointment pretty much from the beginning. It feels like Koontz tried too hard on the psychological part and forgot the suspense. And to add insult to injury it ends up in an anticlimax that feels like a half hearted attempt to copy Stephen King's ""The Dark Half"". Not recommended."
2,Don't waste your time.,"Seriously. This book wasn't that good at all. I'm a new fan to Dean Koontz and I've read about five of his books...and this one just didn't make sense. The beginning started off great, but when you finally find out why Ironheart has his gift...it'll leave yourself saying ""huh?""If you want a good Koontz book, try Odd Thomas, Phantoms or Watchers. Put this one back on the shelf."
3,left me wanting more,"the first half of the story tells of how ironheart is compelled to help others as if he is a superhero. the second half has him trying to uncover why this is happening to him. i was so enjoying the first half that i feel koontz could almost have made two books out of this one. for me, it slowed down when the rescues stopped. it is definitely not my favorite, but i would still recommend."
3,"Weak, But Readable","This is one of the harder Koontz books to review. As others have noted, it starts out well and then goes nowhere...slowly. The payoff is inadequate, for the buildup.As usual, Koontz's characters carry it off, but just barely. The problem is that he sets up too many wonderful possibilities, and out of all of them decides to choose the most prosaic, unlikely, and dissatisfying ending.It's not a bad book, just a disappointing one from someone as gifted as Koontz. Don't start out with this title. Work your way back to it, after reading his better titles and seeing why he became a bestseller. If the basic story idea of this one sounds appealing to you, read Strangers instead - it's quite similar, but much, much better."
2,Not up to expectatins,"I don't usually read Koontz because the stories are usually too gross. Although it has been many years since I read it, I absolutely loved Watchers.Cold Fire is inferior. It is a 382 page book that could have and SHOULD have been edited to a 182 page novella. It killed some beach time for me, but I'm glad I paid $2.00 for it at the used section at the local library.You can find much better reads than this....like ANYTHING by Ken Follett....or watchers.Sorry Dean, I'm a OC guy too and I enjoy reading about the local settings, but this one doesn't do you justice...but I see it WAS written in 1991..."
2,Disappointing,"This book's first half will keep you up, the second half may put you to sleep. The ending of the book leaves much to be desired. Good tale. I don't recommend for a first DK book."
2,Not Dean's best.,"Most of Koontz's books carry you right along to the end and are enjoyable, but some derail and go in directions that are not as interesting as others. I found this book to be that way and despite the 4 star review, was rather bored with it once it got away from Ironheart's rescues. I'd recommend skipping this one."
4,"New definition for ""Windmills of Your Mind""","Dean Koontz's imagination is one sick, twisted puppy. And if he promises to write more books like Cold Fire, I'd gladly supply him with all the kibble he needs."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Book",First let me start off by saying I love Dean Koontz books and I have read most all of them but I was very disapointed with this one. It was very boring and had a horrible ending. Worst Dean Koontz book ever. Go buy Strangers of Watchers if you want a good book that won't leave you disapointed.
2,"What a confusing, twisted--what's going on?!","This is the second Koontz novel that i read. When I read the dust jacket, the plot sounded interesting, but there were some scenes that were just too confusing! There were some suspenseful moments, but the explanations took me nowhere, and it was hard for me to pinpoint the climax. Around the beginning of the book, Koontz used too many ""50-cent"" words, and I pictured the scenery as bland. Let's not make this into a movie. So far, I have read 2 Koontz novels, but I'm not stopping there. I just can hope and pray that my likes outnumber my loathes. Deano, I have new views about you."
2,*sigh* So Koontz Does Sell Out Every Now And Then,"I've read a small handful of Koontz Novels. While some grabbed me and were great, some--like this one--struck me as nothing more than a poorly executed comercial effort to sell by the name of the author; and the name of the author is about all this book has going for it.Several reviewers felt that the book started out great and got bad. I am more under the impression that the books beginning was truly awful, and improved slightly by the end; either way, the effect is an awful book that is only vaguely interesting for half of it's extent. If you really want to give Koontz a fair read, go for Intensity or The Eyes of Darkness, and leave this one on the bookshelf. I am dissapointed in the author for even allowing this to be published under his real name--he should have left it to one of his extensive pseudonyms of the past."
3,HMMMMM...,"To me, the story starts out like the TV show ""The Pretender""...it was gripping and a great read until somewhere near the end where it gets silly, with all the insects and stuff. It is still a great read, and if your a fan of Koontz's, by all means read! His better stuff include Eyes of Darkness and Mr. Murder, in my opinion! --Phoenix King"
3,Good start but then unravels.,"This book has a great start with a man who can see disasters and accidents before they happen and travels around saving people from these disasters. Great premise, but then it go's downhill with a confusing storyline about a phychic monster in a pond by a windmill. weird"
3,This book fell below my expectations of a Koontz novel.,"This is book both suprised and disappointed more than once. Beginning strong and continuing with a powerful storyline this novel compelled me to read on. I became more or less bored towards the end of the climax. Also, the resolution left much to be desired. I personally feel that for Koontz, this book was slighty under his superb level of creativity in writing."
2,Good Story but like Hideaway nothing impressive.,"Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion. Not much there. Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection. Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books. I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works. I don't own much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place. I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon."
2,I couldn't finish it!,"When I started this book, it was pretty good. The storyline was reminescent of Early Edition, where the main character knew of upcoming bad events and people to save and I enjoyed reading it. After the part with the plane, the book started to falter, and by the time the main characters went to the Windmill (sorry to be so specific, but I don't think it will ruin the story), the book was just plain terrible. The twist of the story was predictable and far fetched, so at page 380, I just put the book down. I didn't read the ending, and I don't even care."
1,terrifying....ly horrible,"The book starts fast-paced, suspenseful, and well-written. Then it suddenly feels like Koontz said to himself, ""Oops, I didn't think about what would happen in the second part. Oh well, I'll just pull something that barely makes sense from my ass and hope no one notices."" If Koontz hadn't set up such a great beginning I might be able to be more lenient in my review. However, he completely dropped the ball and disappointed me after getting my hopes up... don't even get me started on the contrived, rushed, and unbelievable love story subplot. Ugh."
3,A good Koontz book but not one of his best.,I usually have difficulty putting a Dean Koontz book down. This one though seemed to drag at times. I have read a lot of his books though and this one is a good one.
3,Bizarre yet compelling,This is one of the most bizarre Koontz novels I have read. Compelling and memorable but didn't make complete sense to me. I did manage to rewrite the mass killing scene even gorier though.
2,One of his weaker efforts,"Koontz can be a thrilling writer, but this one didn't do it for me. Try ""The Bad Place"" or ""Hideaway"" instead."
1,What the?,"I started out really liking this book and then about one-third of the way through Koontz became possessed and dumped his first idea for something totally weird. I kept wondering what happened to the good book I started out reading. It didn't get any better as I muddled my way through this novel searching for the original plot. I think Koontz tried to redeem himself towards the very end, but it didn't work. I had to struggle to finish it. I wouldn't recommend Cold Fire."
3,Unbelievable . . .,"Everything about the novel intrigued me throughout, trying to figure out what was going to happen, what was happening. But then to find out in the end that these creatures were nothing but figments of Jim's imagination was a big let down and a sad disappointment. I was really looking forward to some more supernatural events. And, honestly, I personally know people who have been through things 100 times worse than Jim, but who didn't go over the edge."
4,One of Koontz's Best!,"Cold Fire was one of Dean Koontz's greatest novels. The story was cool and the characters were well developed. The ending was a letdown though. It turns out The Enemy was a creation of Jim's mind like The Friend (take the idea of an imaginary friend or enemy to the extreme), and not some demon like the Ancient Enemy from Phantoms."
2,"Starts out interesting, then morphs into the foulest of crap","The book starts out with an interesting premise and some captivating scenes, but it goes swiftly downhill. The female lead is inconsistent in her motivations, and she and the male lead fall in love for no reason. There is no lead up to the love, no explanation given afterward... It just happens. The author does not show their love, he tells it in the simplest, most unsatisfying words possible. The main plot also crashes terribly, as what originally looks like brewing supernatural mayham turns out to be ridiculous crap instead.The writing itself is bad, too. Infodumps are common, dialogue is unrealistic, etc. If this were a good story with decent characters, the writing would be tolerable, but no such things are to be found in this book.Don't waste your money on this."
4,Cold Fire,Great Book I'll give it 4 stars . All Kootz fans should read.. When is the movie coming out. Waiting :-)
3,Disappointing but not bad,"This book had an interesting premise, with suggestions of a supernatural battle between good and evil, but around the midpoint of the novel it starts to stumble. The overly psycho-analytical therapeutic touchy-feely stuff at the end of the novel feels like it was written by a different author from the more action-oriented gung-ho beginning. The supernatural mystery aspect of this novel also suffered from this disjoint. A good mystery author misdirects the reader but still creates a logical chain of events. The ""solution"" to the mystery is a borderline deus ex machina that's totally unsatisfying. Many things that were suggested or built up at the beginning of the novel are rendered pointless by the end.Having said that, Koontz's prose is certainly readable, his characters are interesting, albeit implausible, and the book was such a quick read that I can't feel too bitter about the ending."
3,"Entertaining, but ultimately a letdown.","Despite the corny aspects (a protagonist named Ironheart? Give me a break!), I found this to be one of Koontz's better novels -- right up to the ending, which has to be the most ludicrous and anticlimactic endings I've read in a Koontz story. I was so disappointed I threw the book across the room. What makes it so annoying is that the first 2/3 of the book is great fun, and leads you to believe that something truly amazing is afoot, but the resolution is trite and lacking in imagination. The way events were building, I expected the book to build to a stunning climax -- but instead it was disappointingly clichéd and a real letdown. It's not a waste of time, but it's not up there with Dean Koontz's best work, in my opinion."
4,TIE Interceptor----- it rocks!,"I've been waiting for this re-released vehicle for quite some time. The exclusive pilot is in fact a different sculpt than the POTF2 version. The neck post is too long making the head really loose right out of the box. It is smaller and much cleaner in details than the earlier version. The Ship itself is also just slightly smaller than the vintage version. The plastic wings are a softer plastic meaning that they more easily bend and warp. The wings don't really sit in the slots all that well, pretty loose actually. The texture on the wings is different than both the POTF2 TIE Fighter and Vader's TIE. Over all, the paint job is pretty cool and the ship is a great addition to any collection."
3,UNFAIR,"AT FIRST I'VE THOUGHT THAT THE SALESMAN WERE MORE HELPFUL IN ORDER TO GIVE ME THE TRACKING INFORMATION, NOR HAVE RESPONDED TO THE E MAILS THAT I HAVE WRITTEN TO THEM, SO IM VERY DISAPPOINTED. IN ORDER OF THE PRODUCT QUALITY I'M JUST LOST BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVEN'T DELIVERED THEStar Wars Power of the Jedi Tie InterceptorON TIME. SO I HOPE IT WILL BE HELPFUL FOR ANOTHER COSTUMER WHO WANTS TO BUY FROM THIS SELLER."
2,"Beautiful Pictures, no information","Poor choice as the videos, while beautiful, are highly repetitive through the 3 separate stories. The narration is poorly written and surprisingly unemotional reading from Paul Sorvino. After 30 minutes we shut this off as it was boring and poorly organized.Lots of fly over shots."
2,early 20 Dead,"20 Dead Flower Children are a great industrial metal band. That being said, this isn't a CD that's up to par with their later work. The biggest fault is the vocalist's weak performance on the majority of the songs. (The singer was later replaced) However, the music is still pretty solid and it's interesting to hear how the band has grown and branched out in direction. This is a very abrasive, bordering on avant-garde, release.A good comparison I can make is that this album holds value like a pre-Mike Patton Faith No More CD has value. It simply isn't as good with the old vocalist but is still interesting because the strong musical roots are there. You can practically feel the potential.If you're looking for an introduction to the band, check out Candy Toy Guns and Television or Garage Demos before making any decisions."
2,the ultimate degenerate,"The movie was pretty good to watch. if you would like to see what happens to the women, who are raped and have to go through gang bangs to live. all three titles show women having sex, later are raped."
4,Before you open that door...,"Caught in the Middle gives a whole new meaning to that old saying, DON'T YOU OPEN THAT DOOR UNTIL YOU CLOSE THE OTHER ONE.Women, please do not throw out your 'trash' if you still want it. One man's junk is another's treasure. In this story, however, the consequences of collecting and restoring that treasure proved to be fatal.Without giving away too much of the story, I will say I truly enjoyed the twists and turns as well as the characters. I do hope there is a follow up as I'm very interested to know what becomes of the 'one who got away' and her accomplice.This book is very well written Ms. Moore!"
1,Definitely not a work shoe,"I used to buy all-leather, steel toe shoes for work. They were black and un-exciting shoes. I decided to chance the look and I was wrong! These shoes do not bound very well with work related activities. They are also very slippery on any type of liquid. I was wrong to belive that being called ""athletic"" was just nother name for a shoe. actually I don't see how anyone could use these shoes for sport: too heavy and bulky. The fabric is thin and does not protect against cold or water: any drop of water on the shoe and one feels it on the foot. Any draft or small wind will go through like one is barefoot. I also believe the the price is way to high for this product. The reality is that one cannot find a cheaper, steel toe, low cut shoe. I suggest, if one needs this for work, to go with the leather version."
3,At least they're not boots.,"I like the fact that they are steel toed tennis shoes and for the most part look and feel like tennis shoes, but they are heavy for obvious reasons. I'd like to find some cabon fiber reinforced toed shoes to cut down the weight. They make them, but it seems only for women. I don't need the full steel toe or the weight that goes with that. If I did I would have bought boots."
1,"terrible,just awful","Cheap everything,with bad acting to match. Puts you in mind of a student film or low budget porn. Really awful."
1,The producers of this must of been on acid!,"I can't believe this film is even called a film. It's by far the most annoying flick I've ever seen. They must not of had more than [...] in their budget to make this. It's like the ultra low budget porn flicks You would come across on the playboy channel in the 80's, I was waiting for the public defender to take her clothes of and start ""doin"" the main character and the guards all at once. But thankfully it's not a porn, they only share the same budget. I don't think I'll ever buy a lions gate movie again. If you like CHEASY LOW BUDGET FILMS buy it, but if you want to watch a decent movie about son of sam buy ""summer of sam""."
1,SON OF SH**,PLEASE!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE!! A TOTAL FLOP...VERY LOW BUDGET...IT'S JUST A COMPLETE PIECE OF SH**! IT DOESN'T EVEN FOLLOW THE TRUE LIFE STORY LINE!!! 10 THUMBS DOWN!!!
1,Movie was nothing what was expected,"This video was ordered for a school project about the Son of Sam. However, the video didn't explain anything and was very hard to follow. It was clearly recorded by an amateur team and the storyboard did not have any direction. The movies was very inaccurate to the true events and the quality of the film was very horrible. It looked like a homemade movie. I would not recommend this video to anybody wanting to know facts surrounding the life of David Berkowitz ""The Son of Sam / .44 Caliber Killer."" I would only recommend this video to amateur film students as a ""what not to do""."
1,Son Of Sam,This movie sucks that's about as simple as I can put it but allow me to elaborate; the worst portrayal of a famed serial killer yet. I am baffled by the fact that Lionsgate got behind this amateurish attempt to make a movie about David Berkowitz. I don't even know why this movie was made since it doesn't in any way accurately portray the killer or his victims nor does it have any memorable performances. There is just simply not one redeemable element in this picture and the viewer will feel ripped off even if I didn't cost them or they were just killing time...they'll still feel cheated.
1,"Awful, truly awful.","I was hoping this movie would be good. The topic is an interesting one. However this movie is a total disappointment. The production is amateurist in the bad sense of the word. The acting is poor, the film quality is second rate, the lighting is bad, the continuity is poor, the dialogue is awful. Even the costumes are mediocre.Unless one wishes to watch a movie and make fun of it, do not watch this Z grade movie. I was fooled by the cover, which is very rare, please do not make the same mistake."
1,Awful. I had to turn it off...,"This movie was awful. I thought I was watching a play. Very poor acting.I can only assume it is the directors fault? Plus, this movie was pure chaos to watch.I will avoid any other movies by this director...The scene setups were way too long...Michael J. Laramee"
1,Save your money and your time.,"This movie is rubish. Do not waste your time on this one. If you want to see a well made film about the son of sam, then see the Spike Lee film ""Summer of Sam"".Summer of Sam"
1,HORRENDOUS,"I actually used to know Yogi through mutual friends in LA and so I had to watch this to satisfy my curiosity - I was actually looking for the John Leguizamo version. This movie has just about the worst acting I've ever seen. Not surprising. I remember Yogi used to moonlight as a ""promoter"" for parties and events...if I remember correctly I think he tried to rip us off after collecting money from all of us for tickets to a New Years party at the Playboy mansion then as we got closer to the event...little by little the playboy mansion turned into a crappy couch at a crappy club. We got our money back after threatening to call the cops. A real loser in every aspect of his life."
4,Cologne,"Thank you & I received it in a timely fashion. Though the bottle top was.different from the one I currently have, I keep spraying to see if it is the same fragrance."
2,It's a crisis alright.,"Looking and reading like a romance novel, I found Crisis at Doona a dissapointment. Being a long time fan of Ms. McCaffrey's I was dismayed at what I read. Instead of the usual well developed characters and stories, cardboard cutouts moved around on a wooden stage. Ms. McCraffrey wrote several romance novels and now apparently has become enamored of the style, sadly enough. Like late period Heinlein, go back and read the earlier works, leave the rest to the rabid fans."
3,Glad I bought 2 sets,"I bought 2 sets of these rings and am glad I did. The first set was bad. The rings themselves are fine, but the screws and nuts to secure the rings to the mounts are very poor quality. When I say the first set was bad I mean one of the nuts was stripped from the factory. The screw would not tighten at all. I've installed enough of these to know what I'm doing and it's the product not the installer. Spend a little more and get a better quality set of rings if you plan on using them on anything more than a .22"
5,Awesome value & perfect product - Low 30mm Rings,"I specifically signed in to write this review after seeing their low rating which they do not deserve. I'm so pleased with my purchase and want to give my input.These rings are fantastic for the price and meet my needs perfectly. Obviously the low rings are going to be LOW by looking at the picture - which is exactly what I needed. I use a 25MOA rail paired with a 50mm objective for long distance shooting and needed rings that will keep the scope a few millimeters from the barrel in order to achieve a proper cheek weld. You will not be able to sustain accuracy if the scope is too high & the cheek weld provides inconsistent sight pictures.I do agree that it is difficult to find information on the height they will raise the scope tube above the rail mounts. However, it's quite easy to make estimates comparing the picture's proportions with the knowlegde that the hole diameter is 30mm.I will certainly be using more of Millet's products in the future."
2,Insufficient information,"I'm looking for a Millet 1"" detachable Weaver style ring with a specific height. The Millet DT00703 has a height of .470"", which would meet my needs. But this item and other Millet ""High"" rings sold on Amazon don't list the Millet model number or the base to scope body distance.The price here is slightly better, but what use is saving a few dollars if my scope slaps against my barrel when I try to mount it because the ring was the wrong height?I'm going to spend some extra money and get the Millet rings that I know are what I want."
5,Oldies but goldies,"I know this book for over 25 years and I consider it as one of the most useful in teaching the aeroelasticity, despite its obsolety in some aspects. Solid theory of structures and unsteady aerodynamics on basic level. Valuable examples. Clear physical explanations of aeroelastic phenomena. It's simply the best!"
3,Goldies but oldies,"It would be fair to mention that the book was first published more than forty years ago, and that the most recent reference still dates back to the mid-fifties.."
5,truly superb -- very thirstquenching and not too sweet,"Stack up on this drink -- especially on hot summer days. It is something you will need and need more of. I haven't used it with any booze, but I'll bet you could mix some interesting drinks with it -- a kind of mildly flavored, not too sweet, just a soupcon of bitterness with the sweet and sparkle. Very Very refreshing"
1,overpriced...,"This product is over-priced for what you get. This is very similar to the San Pelligrino Orangiata(wrong spelling), which is way more reasonable in price."
4,Another good Harry outing,"Every album from Harry is different from the one before. Sometimes the experiment doesn't work (like that Star Turtle thing) but most are great. This one's really good. Very low production, just Marsalis and Harry playing together. But they're both excellent. Wonder why Branford doesn't get more billing on this project, on many of the songs he carries the melody line. No matter, it's a good effort from both."
4,Its all marsalis.,"This album is fantastic but I was expecting more Harry. Obviously he's on every track, it is his album after all, but Branford really steals this album. His sax is great, and this album made me a fan of his. I love Harry, but some of his piano on this disc is too simple and at times it blends in so much you almost forget its there. All around good album."
4,Better than expected,"Harry Connick is a talented entertainer. I first started listening to him around the time his albums ""20"" and ""When Harry Met Sally"" were released. As his popularity grew, his music seemed to move away from jazz and towards more popular pop/swing settings. So I missed out on Occasion when it was first released, only recently picking it up when I learned that it was a duo album with Branford Marsalis, who I consider one of the modern masters of jazz.The music is terrific, featuring easy-going, thoughtful duos between Harry and Branford. Branford contributes two songs, and Harry is responsible for the remainder. This album is a worthy companion to the duo album Branford released with Joe Calderazzo (Songs of Mirth and Melancholy)."
3,Fascinating subject - fascinating stories - mediocre author,"If it were her first work, Katherine Ramsland could be forgiven for her mediocre telling of some fascinating tales. If you have ANY interest/curiosity about death and the processes associated with this, you will be fascinated by the information in this book. Unfortunately, you probably won't be as impressed by the telling of it.Just my opinion folks - I still think the book was worth the [money] - I learned alot from it. But I wouldn't buy another book by this particular author."
2,Amusing.... sorta...?,"My fiance picked this book up for me because it had ""Cemetery"" in the title. Gotta love the guy for trying! It was a bit scattered and there wasn't much I either didn't already know, or could have just watched the Historys Mysteries episode on Death found out all I need to know. Its amusing a times - very short times - and then it shoots off to another direction and loses its train of thought. Its OK. Not great, not horrible..."
3,Review of Cemetery Stories,"It is interesting to read, however it did not have any pictures. National Geographic's television show called ""Tabo"" showed the body farm in Knoxville, TN in detail and how research there is help us to learn more about crime scene investigation. Some was described in this book. Also some of the crime investigation stories as seen on HBO, with Dr. Michael Baden are described. Some of characters for the movies ""Pyscho"" and ""Texas Chainsaw"" are described in reality. The book also talks about necrophilia, the funneral business, interesting stories by morticians, cemetery stories and more."
1,Poor book,"This book is, mainly, just a scattershot gathering of stories Ramsland came across while she was researching her other books. You'll see some urban legends, such as the wife who put a check in her husband's casket when the will said his money had to put in the casket, presented as fact by the ever-gullible Ramsland.The book sinks to new depths as Ramsland goes into repeated graphic descriptions of corpse abuse by mortuary employees.There are LOTS better books on the topic than this one!"
3,cemetery stories,"I enjoyed reading this book, and to me the best part were the websites listed in the back. Interesting.."
2,"Ramsland's Forte is fun, not facts","Cemetery Stories is a ghoulishly fun read but scattershot of focus. Ramsland is very good at wandering about, talking to people whom she encounters, but not so good at in-depth research. There are no real facts in this book about the handling of bodies, decomposition, or the funeral industry that couldn't be found online or in reference books. There are no historic cases mentioned that haven't been trotted out on TV or in print a dozen times before. The bulk of the new material in the book is ""I have this friend who said..."" stories that may be true, but mostly sound like urban legends.The upshot: if you know nothing about the topic, you'll definitely have your eyes opened and probably a good giggle, too. If you are looking for anything other than a romp, this isn't the book to choose."
5,Fascinating look about the business of death,"Though not a book for the squeamish, it is a nonetheless engrossing work on the business of death. Ms. Ramsland wanted to know about a subject that no one really likes to think about, so she went to the experts, from morticians to funeral directors to cemetery caretakers. She touched on everything from buying the ""right"" coffin, to whether or not to creamate, to tracing the writings on gravestones. Being a ghosthunter, I especially enjoyed her sharing the experience she had in a allegedly haunted cemetery, and I was touched as well by the story of how her and some friends celebrated the Day of The Dead in Mexico.I'm sure there are people who would read this book with a cocked eyebrow, but those people would be finishing it perhaps a little more informed. I know I learned quite a bit from it!"
3,NOT FOR CHILDREN......,"I am a former Death care worker, and I bought this hoping to hear some of the same tales we all told. Well, all of us in death care know there are creeps out there that mistreat corpses, but to write about all of it in the open market where kids could read it is too much. Some of the people in this book that Katherine wrote about should have been prosecuted. Necrophilia of the most physical kind...not the witchy talking to the dead....is a most mature subject matter,objectionable even. The people that participate in corpse abuse, mutilation or sexual acts, are mentally ill or evil or both. If you buy this book, and it has some interesting tales and some fact, don't leave it around for young people. Thanks, Dawn."
2,"This book was.....""dead""","I read this book in a matter of days because it really struck my curiosity from the get-go. Yes, it was filled with very interesting facts about the funeral industry, alot of macabre and eerie stories (even a horrid true story of necrophilia that I surely could have done without). Ms. Ramsland surely does take you to places and scenarios that few have gone to before. Yet I find her approach to be very disrespectful, most especially when she implies that an obese person's corpse looked like a whale and did not seem human. It's sentences like these that add the sourness to the book. Overall I would recommend the book to those that are extremely curious about the eerie and not so pleasent aspect of death, yet I would caution that most of the subjects that were not so cleverly compilled in this book are things that its just better we not know about."
3,Cute but not too entertaining,I purchased this for my daughters first Christmas. It is a cute product but she was not too interested in it.
1,faulty,"got this at Home Depot for doing some things on my computer. I got it and the very, very thin solder that they did not say you needed and I had to go to 4 different places. Then as I got home I sat down and started soldering and it would not give me 1 good joint. Plus the D*** head wont stay on. Then as i put the soldering iron into it's case furious that i only made a half decent joint the tip broke as I was puting into the section just for it.Go get a normal soldering iron. It may be less safe but at least it works."
1,Cheated -Wasted $4.50 for this Crap,Don't buy this pdf. It is just 25 pages. It doesn't contain anything useful.
1,Out of date,The OCP exam that this was written for was on Release 11.0 (not 11i) and was withdrawn by Oracle in 2001 - you can no longer sit the exam so on that basis alone I wouldn't waste my money.
4,All good,"The backpack is fine if you have a very small or portable notebook, if you own a medium or large size notebook, do not think for a second the backpack will be comfortable or anything, as long as you have a small or minimum size notebook the backpack is great."
4,Best all-in-one collection available,"Producers had the good sense to load this two-disc CD complete with not only the dozens and dozens of Top 40 radio gems from the 70s and 80s but also provide a special touch -- some great pieces from ELOs 11 albums that weren't ""hits"" but are great tunes. One drawback -- some classics are unnecessarily edited, such as Can't Get it Out of My Head. CD quality clear, though light on liner notes and supporting materials."
5,Truly ELO's very best,"This group has a sort of cult following but I think talent wise, they rank up there with the Beatles and other great UK bands. This CD is the best. Period. My only bummer is one of my favorite songs, ""Can't get it out of my head"" was cut short by over a minute to 3:07 from 4:24, which is significant. Other than that, the songs sound great, most have been remastered or enhanced. Some songs could have been mastered better but not many. Unless you want to buy 4-5 ELO CDs to get this mix of songs, this particular album is the best."
3,Mostly the singles collection,"Light Years, The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra was first released in November 1997. It's mostly made up of the single edits of all their hits so if you want to get those all in one place, this is it. I generally prefer the longer album versions myself. It's also the first ELO compilation to feature the edit of the song ""Across the Border"" which was scheduled to be released as an EP track in 1980 but was nixed. If you like the singles versions better than the album versions then this release is right for you. If you prefer the full length versions, you might want to start elsewhere (such as Strange Magic, Afterglow, Flashback, All Over The World and Ticket To The Moon) or simply buy the original albums which are fairly cheap brand new."
4,satisfied customer,"While surprised it came from Germany, no complaints at all. Product was true to form with no issues at all."
3,Sound quality is just okay,"I think the problem with ELO is that they were not that well recorded originally. Sounds a little tinny, not an audiophile recording to say the least."
2,Poorly Structured - Bare Bones Information,"This book doesn't even qualify as a book - it's just a list of bullet points of basic JavaScript information. It seems as if they put together a topic list, sent it out to a few people who've taken the test, asked those people to write a bullet or two on those topics, and then compiled the answers into this ""study guide."" Although comparatively cheap, I still don't believe it was worth the money spent.Probably the only users who would find this useful would be those who've never encountered the basics of Javascript. But if you're in that category, I'd strongly suggest full book on learning Javascript."
3,Come on!!!!,"This could have been a really good story but the author took the near-ending to the extreme. Anna was okay up until she ran across the ship (in 1880)tore off her clothes to show a pink bikini and dove in the water, headed to shore. THEN, was kidnapped, still dressed in her bikini (in 1880)and no one really seemed to notice, even the crew who stood watching her swim away, after James had warned her time and time again about his men.That was just tooo enreal and stupid. She had been in 1880 for weeks then went back to the 21st century before being able to return to James and the best she could do is slip a bikini on underneath her clothes. The book was ruined by this absurdity .The book was really, really good until the bikini entered into it.I don't mind fantasy in a book but that was too much.Unbelievable can be a good thing but stupid is just...well...stupid."
2,Not precise enough,"I did not enjoy this book. It is a very high-level view on component-based development that lacks any detail. Often statements are made without further explanation and terms are used without definition. The book does not go into detail how you would group functionality to components nor what makes good interfaces. References to some technology in the middle of an abstract discussion are somehwat irritating.The book is not bad. However, it gives you what you probably already knew and leaves you with the feeling ""and now?""."
4,A good book for component based design,"This book is somewhat brief and high level, but it does a good job describing how components should interact within the enterprise. It is also gives a good description on how to define component interfaces."
5,The Total Triathlon Almanac-5,"The Total Triathlon Almanac-5 is the best training log I have used in my 30 plus years as an endurance athlete and coach. It is actually much more than just a training log. It's a valuable training tool, packed with training and racing tips from Mark Allen, Dave Scott and several other all-time triathlon greats. This information, combined with Tony Svensson's inspiring photos, make the Almanac-5 a great source of motivation as well. This is simply the most comprehensive training logbook and resource available.Don Fink, Author of ""Be IronFit: Time Efficient Training Secrets for Ultimate Fitness."""
3,Finally works,"for all of you who can't seem to make this work:I have finally got it to print from win7 64bit .the problem was bi-directional communication. in short this adapter does not support it.what you have to do is in the printer properties, ports tab, disable bi-directional and you're good to go.I solved this while giving it a last try before throwing it in the trash.hopes this helps."
1,Aweful. Just aweful.,"Received this in fall of 2007 from Dell. After trying for years periodically to get this to work on multiple printers, alas, nothing."
1,Didn't live up to my expectations,"Ultimately, I returned this product. It was horribly slow, and it kept crashing on me. I haven't had problems with any of my other Bluetooth devices. Maybe Bluetooth printing technology just isn't there yet, though."
3,Multifunction printers?,"Hi -I'm thinking of purchasing this and I was wondering if anyone had tried this with an all-in-one printer. I'd like for the bluetooth to work with the printing function, though I can deal if it doesn't work with scanning and copying.Thanks"
5,Best price/value ratio out there,"We bought a bunch of the Iogear Combo adapters, and all failed within the first 60 days. So we replaced them with Belkin. Big name, right? Can't go wrong.Correct. These are very simple - two lights, both very bright and easily seen in all lighting conditions. Amber blinking alone - all is well with the adapter. Blue and Amber blinking alternately - time for an adapter reset (power down printer and adapter, power up adapter and wait a fifteen count, power up printer.) Blue flashes brightly when receiving data.We even paired it with the unbelieveably cheap HP LJ1012 printers and they give pretty good throughput. It's not as fast as directly USB connection, but then again we won't be busting USB connectors this way.The best part was when I first found these at CDW, they were selling them for < $40. I should have bought more then, because they're $56 now."
1,Do not buy,"I am on my second product, having returned the first, and the device worked well for a couple of weeks before failing in the same way the first did -- lights flashing and customer service unsure how to reset the device. Belkin's customer service seems to do their best, and returning products through Amazon is easy, but the product is a dud.I am using the device with a ThinkPad and HP LaserJet. A rather typical and simple set up."
4,Great Product,This USB Printer adapter works well -- great for working with a laptop around the house!
1,Zero Stars,"I don't even want to give this one star and I'm annoyed that it was reccommended for me. Yes, JESSICA is beautiful, talented, etc., but her exactly opposite sister is tring to climb onto her fame. She lipsynches, live- she gets booed and sounds terrible. She's awkward, she can't sing, and she just wants her sister's fame. And her former friend's ex-boyfriend apparently. Bad person, bad album, empty songs.For new and GOOD - try Skye Sweetnam, Brie Larson, and Alexz Johnson (who is a real actress who sings - like lindsay lohan)ashlee is just what she hates- untalented and unattractive like hilary duff"
1,Boycott Ashlee Simpson!,Go to the site below and see her lip sync mishap on Saturday Night Live. She is so embarressed that she runs off stage and leaves her band playing Solo. Then she has the balls to blame her band for the mishap. She should blame herself for being a no talent loser.http://www.ebaumsworld.com/ashlee-snl.htmlDo not support Ashlee Simpson. The music industry is cutting good musicians out of the industry because they can have 100 percent control over no talent artist like Ashlee and Britney. Ashlee had a cute little acting career going. She should have been thankful and left the singing career to her sister...
1,The end of her 15 minutes,"I just downloaded this album and I will never get the 2 minutes and 13 seconds back I spent listening to it. Man, I could of taken out the trash, started my laudry, fed the dog, hell, I could of even rubbed one off in that time. This was the worst album I have ever heard. I'm sure that next time the world hears from Ashlee is when she checks into rehab. Meanwhile, I will continue to dance on the recording industry's grave."
1,How can you buy this Crap??,"It makes me want to puke that this dumb biznich is on MTV parading around like she's some starving artist, cruising around like the dumb, spoiled bimbo she is in a fukking convertable LEXUS!!! Trying to act like she's a rock and roller,When there are tons of people out there pouring there heart and soul into music because it is their passion!!! Pretending to write songs and acting like we don't know her sister is the queen of lame ass wanna-be pop stars this is seriously like a fukkin' joke!...It's just disgusting!!! You seriously have no business listening to music or calling yourself a music lover if you buy this garbage!!!MTV must Die! The Insults have gone on long enough!!! Fukk MTV!!!"
2,those pieces need to shadder,I like the song but hate her voice she cant sing she needs to stick to acting. The only reason she has anything is because of Jessica. Her voice and show sucks. People really need to give creadit to real singers and bands like Lillix.
3,Good if you like her and her show!,"If you go to mtv.com right now, you can actually get a chance to listen to her whole album before it comes out July 20th ((Only 6 days away))...Now I'm a big MTV fan...but i had doubts about Ashlee Simpson...I admit, she wouldnt have gotten so famous so quick if it wasn't for her older sister, Jessica. Having said that, after all my doubts, her album is actually pretty good..in my opinion. I was not an Ashlee Simpson fan before, but after watching her show for a bit, and listening to all her tracks on MTV's The Leak...I believe her album is fairly good. This rate is for the single CD, If I had to rate her ""Autobiography"" cd right now..i'd give it 4 stars..because the type of music she sings, I am into. I hope Ashlee makes it big despite living in Jessica's shadow, those girls are gorgeous and I believe they can make it!"
5,exellent,ashiley is the best singer in the world of all singers.this cd is the best cd ever.you should try it.
1,oh help,Can a song be any worse? When will America quit buying such trash? Have you watched this girl whine on her show? She is worse than Jessica! I actually like Jessica because she is so true and honest. This girl is nothing but a sellout.
1,Vile excrement,One can only hope that the record company who pumped so much money into her will take a bath after the twin SNL and Orange Bowl fiascos. I'd like the see whoever signed her fired and shunned from the industry forever.
1,Come on people!,"I'm sorry, but this child has no talent to speak of,much less review.A real voice and a good set of lungs don't need studio magic and sister's fame to put her on the front line of entertainment.Shame on her,shame on her greedy father and shame on us for giving her the time of day.If we ignore and label her the no talent waste of space called Ashlee Simpson,We pray she will go away."
4,She's kool!,"Hey, look, i know some people don't even like Ashlee. But i think she's pretty good. Jess has a better voice, but Ashlee's is more appealing. The husky voice is pretty good. Yeah, i don't think her music is punk, but hey, she probably dresses a bit punky cos that's what she likes. She might like a large variety of different music genre's but she might just like to dress 'punky'. I think good on her for being who she wants to be. This song is great! I think she should quit her acting job and just stick to singing!"
1,Very Weak,"FROM (GEORGE)A REAL RECORD PRODUCER, FROM LONDON: This CD is a very weak, generic performance, by a weak singer. Bad phrasing, more of the same production, auto-tuned to death. Any one of a dozen media made kids could replace her on this record and do the same thing if not better(Lindsay Lohan next?). This CD has to do with media presence not music.Any comparisons to Gwen Stefani are absolutely absurd. Her fans will enjoy this record. The rest of the public will not. More pop pap, that will go away as fast as it came.Unless you watch her show, save your money"
1,Horrible!,"Save your money - buy a DVi to HdMi adapter! This video card did not work right fromthe beginning. First off the video driver software does not pass the ""Microsoft LogoTesting"" during installation. Secondly, the driver will not load during Windows XPstartup if the HdMi cable is plugged in. The only way I could get this card to work isunplug the HdMi cable, start up the computer & load WinXP, hot plug the HdMi cablereconfigure the driver to see 2 displays - way too much trouble. ANTonline will notrefund this defective product because I installed the video driver software on mycomputer. MSi is not a big help either."
5,great service,Greatly appreciated the prompt service as I was anxiously looking forward to reading this book with a cup of tea. The seller even included a bookmark!
2,Eh..,"I read this with my second grader and due to many references and language, I feel that I should have read it first. I probably would not have read this with her (or have her read it) until she is much older. It was hard to relate to due to teenage problems and language, even though the characters are supposedly only in the fourth grade. I had to pass over parts such as when the main character is called a ""tramp."" I just feel that it is hard to relate to and inappropriate for the age group that it for."
5,I like it,Just got done listening to MD: Birth of Cool on my Audio Technica at-LP60 hooked up to the 4109 Sherwood using 2 x Sony SSB1000 it's a cheap setup I know but I love it. Perfect for me.TV sounds nice too (I was using stock before) as long as this machine gives me long life I'll be happy.
5,RX-4190 Receiver,"Received the receiver in good condition in the time quoted on sale listing. Have used the receiver now for about a week. Checked out the Phono, CD, and Tape postion, all worked great. The FM & AM radio feature works OK. Sound is good, but due to our location, reception isn't too good. Probably with better antennas than those supplied, it would be much better. Plan on trying that later"
4,A fine receiver,"I've only had this receiver for a few weeks, but it works just fine and sounds great with my Bose bookshelf speakers. I live in a small city about 30 miles from Baltimore and 40 miles from Washington. AM reception is not good; FM reception is OK with a high gain antenna. Short of putting an antenna up on the outside of the house, I think this is the best I'm going to do. Glad I got it, just wish reception was better."
1,Power Failure--Bad Stereo--Pervasive Power Issues.,"I've owned this receiver for 5-6 months. I have the problem that the stereo won't stay on. It stays on for a few seconds, then the power goes to standby. I researched on the Internet to see if I could somehow fix this, and apparently this is a big problem with Sherwood receivers. I do not recommend. Go with a different brand. I'm going to have to, to replace this unfortunate waste of money."
1,JUNK ..INHERENT POWER FLAWS IN SOME UNITS,"If you research the net on these theres mixed reviews..I think its a gamble..the unit I purchased new I had for 3 days..the bass response was not very good and the high response too high..after 3 days of use hooked up to 8 ohm optimus higher end loud speakers the amp started shutting down by itself...inherent flaw in design on these I,m guessing as other reviewers on the net claim the same issue..ive seen some try to explain it away as 4 ohm speakers attached..nope mine were 8 ohm and same issue..returned."
4,Receiver,Great item. It was a gift and perfect for hook up of turntable and other stuff. Recipient has been playing her records almost everyday. What makes it even better is that it's easy to operate with clear display and function buttons. Many Thanks
1,Not thrilled with this receiver,Bought it on Amazon but came from Audio Store. The receiver took me an hour to set up and then did not perform as expected (turntable wouldn't even generate sound but would on my old receiver which I rehooked up) so it went directly back costing me shipping both ways. I will stear clear of Sherwood
2,Sherwood Box,"Bought this Box, and I call it a box, because, it is relatively quite large. I thought we were living in the micro-processor age. Turns out that it is so big because it is the oldest technology that you can imagine, and it is manufactured in China (expected), but ""designed"" in the US of Ah. Very Strange: The speaker wires don't seem to lock in the back. The sound is sort of okay. But you can't go wrong for $56, if Amazon gives you a $40 discount for opening a credit card account from JPMorgan, a detestable bank which cheated me on a car rental in Europe, and I proceeded to cancel my account."
5,Sherwood RX-4109 105 Watt Stereo Receiver,"I bought this Sherwood to replace a 1970's era Radio Shack AM/FM stereo tuner that did yeomen service over the years. Receiver arrived in a timely manner and is perfect for my needs. Fairly simple controls that even this senior citizen can easily use, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."
2,Worked for about a year...kind of cheap all around.,"I received one of these for Christmas 2011.I wanted an inexpensive receiver for my basement workshop.In general it is pretty cheap and poorly built, but it does ( did ) work.After about 7 months the outputs for the speakers stopped working.The headphone jack works, but there is no sound through the speakers.And really...for 99 dollars nobody it going to take this to a repair place.Personally I would spend an extra 20-30 dollars and go with the low-end Sony.That is what I plan to do this next time around."
5,Additioonal component,"Excellent review; excellent price; It was not difficult to hook up to my multiple disk player. It has brought me many hours of peacefullness, especially at Christmas time"
3,A good basic receiver,At second thought the next Sherwood receiver with a few more options for a bit more might have beena better choice for me. Still it's a fine piece.
2,Sounds alright while its on.,"I have tested this with two 4ohm cerwin vega ls-12's and it shuts itself off at around 3/4 volume. No protect mode displayed on the panel. Just off. I haven't tested it with 8ohm speakers like i assume it is supposed to run, but i also am not going to take the time to. My other receiver is a sony str-de197 which powers my cerwin's just fine. For 50 more bucks on amazon's site you can pick the sony up, and trust me, you want to."
2,"poorly designed and made, but pumps out pretty good sound","I bought the Sherwood RX-4109 back in Dec 2007 to replace a 25 year old receiver. The Sherwood died some 22 days later (would not power up). The replacement failed yesterday (no sound). I have given up on Sherwood.To its credit, I thought the receiver generated fairly good sound. But its overall design and user interface were clunky, and the FM tuner abysmal.Bottom line: with two failed units within 18 months I cannot recommend the Sherwood despite its very attractive price."
1,Learned my lesson,I bought this in January of 2010. By August it was not functioning. It turned itself off a few seconds after I turned it on. I called Sherwood and they told me where to send it for warranty repair. I sent it in and it took six weeks to fix it. When I received it back it did the exact same thing it was doing when I sent it in. I should have spent another $50 and got a Sony. I'm sending it back again but who knows how long it will take to get this resolved.
2,"Weak BASS sound, otherwise unit is worth the money.","After reading all the reviews, and owning a slowly dying Kenwood receiver. I took a chance and purchased the sherwood rx4109. I replaced my kenwood with the new Sherwood, and immediately realized what quality sound was. I played CD's and tried the tuner. There was no comparison between my old Kendwood and the Sherwood. The biggest downfall fo the sherwood was its inability to play a decent bass. No matter what you did the bass was weak and lacking. There is no window shaking with this unit. So I sent it back. I immediately was refunded no questions asked ( you gotta love Amazon ). So my search still continues. But I did not lose any money. But I stress.... the Bass really is weak. Otherwise the unit runs well and has an easy set up. BASS lovers will hate this unit, so be warned. The price is right, but I really enjoy a decent bass background. Oh well I guess I made my point."
5,incredible for the price,"Today I was hunting for receivers all over the place for my new 120watt floor speakers. I found the sherwood receiver at PC richard & son. The person helping me hooked up this receiver to a pair of 150watt floor speakers. We compared it to a sony brand that cost significantly more and I could not tell the difference. We cranked it up, played radio, cds, threw as much as we could on the sherwood and it continued to play with no problems. I fell in love instantly. For the price, the sherwood receiver is a must buy. On par with high end, brand name competitors. Simply amazing. I'm definitely buying this product."
1,Made in china...,"The receiver lacks flexibility if you want to connect speakers with less than 8 ohms. The remote control was a joke, almost like a toy and it didn't work at all with the unit. The manual doesn't explain very much either. It had some humming once turned on. The volume knob would jump from levels so I had to turn it very gently to get the volume that I wanted. I regret buying this brand. Next time I will save more and buy something (hopefully) not made in china if I can."
1,Ripped Off,"I ordered and received this receiver/amp in July 2012. When I first connected my speakers to it all the modes made it sound like my speakers were bad, lots of hiss, crackle and pop. Well my speakers are over 30 years old, so I thought they maybe the cause of the problem. I finally purchased new speakers the middle of September 2012 and connected them to the unit...same exact noise and problem I experienced with my old speakers.I tried to contact the seller (The Nerds) through Amazon (Contact the Seller) but have not received a response from them at all. I recommend that no one purchase anything from this company as they are NOT buyer friendly. I don't want my money back, just a replacement unit or this one fixed.But they have to quit ignoring my request and answer my email to them first.Sherwood RX-4109 105 Watt Stereo Receiver (Black)"
2,"Disappointment with This Sherwood, Praise for Amazon","I recently tried 3 times this Sherwood model. It too often shut off by itself. Maybe from a circuit breaker inside it, or from poorly manufactured press-buttons on it, or from an electrical problem where I live. I plugged the unit into different sockets, and the problem persisted.I have the same model that I bought years ago, functioning well in the bedroom. I also have that model at a house in Florida, without it shutting off.Amazon was surprisingly fast in replacing the receiver with the same receiver at my New York City apartment, within the return period, without hesitation. The problem continued. Again, maybe the problem is related to circuitry in the apartment. The Sherwood and an earlier, older Onkyo receiver continue to have similar problems, where some of the buttons suddenly fail."
3,It's a good receiver,"It's not as good as my old Technics amp and tuner, or (better yet), my old Marantz 2252 receiver, but the sound quality is pretty good for $98. You have bass and treble tone controls to improve the sound quality (no mid-range), phono connection (different impedance) in case you still have vinyl, and two pairs of speaker wiring posts capable of handling 14-gauge speaker wire. It's a pretty good receiver for the money."
3,Good old fashion unit except for terrible antenna connection,"This is the good old fashioned tuner-receiver I wanted and needed. It works well in all functions except as a receiver. The antenna connection is simply too poor to be in a receiver built in 2012. The first I received didn't work at all and couldn't be coerced to function (despite trying several different antennae that worked in other units). The second worked in a barely adequate way (with some jiggling from time to time). Despite buying a new, better antenna a little noise is introduced. I mostly stream FM over the internet through other speakers so I don't care so long as it works for the occasional local program and storm news (this is in the Florida Panhandle). By the way, I bought this through Amazon so service both of the original purchase and the replacement was excellent as always. The replacement was sent even before the original was returned!"
4,Seems just fine,For the price it seems like a nice unit. Not a lot of bells and whistles but that's good for my needs.Very clear on FM. With good bookshelf speakers I could never turn volume over 1/3 of the way up.I am a classical music listener and with this amp I can hear the full range of the orchestra. The original Night on Bald Mountain was awesome!
4,Good amp!,"I'm happy with this inexpensive amp. I had posted that the phono input did not work before, but then I switched the turntable's preamp off and it worked fine. If you're having troubles that way, I recommend doing that."
4,it rocks,"Nice piece for the amount of money I spent on it . It functions very well , easy hook-ups , good instruction manual. Fits great in the amount of space I had . I like it ."
4,"Great sound, a little bulky","It works great, but it's a little bulky (and heavy as well). I bought it because of the phono amp, and it does a great job!"
1,Not enough bottom end,"Reviews claimed this had lots of bass response, no way near enough for my Kenwood KL-777 speakers! I am very disappointed."
3,Entry level stereo receiver,"I purchased the Sherwood and the Teac AG-790A so I can do an informed side by side comparison. The Teac is a good receiver with very good sonics and similar power output as the Sherwood. The Sherwood, however, is not as good sounding as the Teac and would disappoint you unless the speakers you are using are a fortuitous match with the unit. I love bargain equipment and am an electronics junkie so I kept the Sherwood rather than returned it. For the small difference in price, I suggest you buy the Teac."
1,sherwoord rx-4109 bad choice,Bought this product twice and set up all systems according to the directions. I found out that after this system is on for a few seconds to play back from any of the components it would shut off. After 2 tries returned product and would not buy one again or recommend this product.
1,Radio Stations,The FM cord was broke at the connection on the back and I could not find another to replace it so for that reason it had to go back.
4,Good,Sound quality: GoodUser interface: DecentInput used: Line out from alienware. Have not used it with DVD player or TV.Durability: Unknown as of now.
4,Sherwood RX-4109 105 Watt Stereo Receiver (Black),"This unit was purchased to replace an existing Sherwood receiver which quit working, but had given many years of good service. Reliability and price are factors most important to me."
4,needed more sound power,"it was hard to set up at first ,especialy speaker connections,one small problem if u really crank the sound up the system would shut off, think i fix that, maybe i don't have right matching speakers. would reccomend but if your like me it might take a little time. am/fm pulls in strong signals in my area."
3,Sherwood Receiver----Works O.K.,"I bought this item for use in my garage, to replace a Fisher Brand unit that i had had for at least 20+ yrs and would no longer let me turn the volume up or down. I am using four speakers that were put up 15yrs ago and were old then. The unit plays either two or all four speakers and alows me to adjust the volume up or down, and it was cheap and free shipping what else can u ask for in a garage???"
5,"Honest, honoring, and engrossing","Beautifully narrated, well-acted, well-written, unexpectedly engrossing. What a story! Placed well in its historical context, also filmed in many of the actual locations. Dramatizations have to take a few liberties with aspects of the story that are unknown to history (such as dialogue), but this seems to take few. Made with obvious love for the KJV and a total conviction of Christianity, but without the sentimentality so often found in church film productions. The film refuses to gloss over character flaws of people involved, but doesn't emphasize these flaws, and honors the achievements. Tastefully yet honestly portrayed. Uplifting."
2,Okay,"This was from the standpoint that all translations are okay, and they are not. Some would consider this unbiased, but I would not."
5,Classic Bond,"Is there anymore that needs to be said? So much better than the movies, but you can appreciate what Sean Connery brought to the role"
2,Diamonds are Forever,The content was rather boring. The text a little on the juvenile side. The movie was better. I would not recommend this.
2,"Fleming's a God, But He's Only Human","So, it comes to this: everybody goofs now and then, so why such a big deal if Fleming does it. You can't save the world once a year, and not slip up. But, the real thing that Fleming messes up on in this is a real villian (Italian gangsters don't cut it) and a real conflict (big deal if diamonds are smuggled every year, I can't afford them)."
3,Diamonds are forever- pretty good,this is the first Bond novel i ever read but i found it to very good. The highlights consist of Bond's incognito and infiltration of a diamond smuggling ring. Though it lacked a little action the book was not bad.
3,Ah if only we were all like James Bond,"The thing to remember when reading a Bond book is that it is not about spys, casinos or girls. Bond is about what can be achieved by anybody so long as they are well endowed. Bond in this novel achieves his aims not with bullets or thought but with the knowledge that all males are intimmedated by his extensive manhood. This is how he survives near certain death by making his enemies fell smaller in the most personel of ways. Women in this novel do not fall for his looks or wit, no it is only when they embrase him and feel the collosus he possess. This book is thus merely an illustration of what man can achieve through nature gifts being unequally distributed and is reason enough why every male who can afford to should see a surgeon about enhancement surgery"
2,See the film burn the book!,An almost unreadable entry in Ian Fleming's James Bond series. 007 takes on the mafia. Don't say I didn't warn you.
3,007 VS. THE MOB,"OO7 is given a challenging task in Fleming's fourth novel. It seems diamonds are being smuggled out of Engish mines and MI6 is called on to stop it. This assignment even has M worried, but not James Bond who considers American gangsters not to threatning. But that is before he meets Wint and Kidd and the hunchback Shady Tree and the Spang brothers. Diamonds may be forever but 007's life might not. Highlights:Felix and Bond reunion; Horse Race; Acme bath sequence; derailment of train; climax on the ocean liner."
4,Good Book! But the Item Picture should be updated.,"I really enjoyed all the James Bond Novels, they are really a good read. Ian Fleming does and exceptional job of painting a scene for you with words.I love the artwork on the cover of this edition of the novel, however, the picture is a little misleading. I only say this because the most current printings (the ones I received) have an Ian Fleming Centenary seal on the cover, which conceals a small part of the cover art. Not a big deal, but i do like my books to match. This is not his fault, or Amazons, but Penguins fault. That is the minor nit-pick i have about it."
3,No bad,"Diamonds Are Forever is pretty good. It has a really good story, but there's not that much action. It kinda takes a while to get going, and when it finally does get going, it goes back to being boring real quick. But if you like Fleming and you like James Bond, you should read this book."
3,Better than the movie,"As a child and a fan of the James Bond movies my parents always said that the Ian Fleming books were better than the movies.This story takes a fun trip that probably could not be made into a movie today simply because some of the plot permutations are not plausible to a 21st century audience.But were here to review books not 30+ year old movies based on nearly 50 year old books.Fleming has a thrifty way with words and can paint a great picture. For me the fun of his books is how different BondIs portrayed compared to the way the movies did it. Not as many gadgets, not any of the wry humor throwaway lines, this Bond is more vulnerable too. I enjoyed this and agreed that my parents were right, the books were better than the films."
3,I See the Movie in a Different Perspective,"Overall, a good story. Diamonds are Forever is one of the more ""forgettable"" older Bond flicks. However, after reading this story I have a new appreciation for the movie (or at least the screen play writers). They made a very interesting adaptation for the movie - kinda interchanging the Bond character with the Windt & Kidd characters in terms of roles/mission. Of course the Blofeld character or SPECTRE does not exist in the book, so that part of the movie now stands out like a sore thumb compared to the book (it is a BIG weakness in the movie). But, in defence of EON productions, they had to remedy Bond seeking revenge for his wife's murder in On Her Majesty's Secret Service movie - so they merged the Blofeld story line into an adaptation of the Diamonds are Forever book story. An interesting fusion. I still do not think its the best Bond movie, but it is one of the better Bond books (I have read 6 so far - in order)."
4,Super Reader,"This novel has an opponent for Bond that is quite different. He is sent by M to look into diamond smuggling in Africa, that he determines is run buy the American Spangled Mob. After infiltration, he comes across the nasty assassins Wint and Kidd, part of the gang, and the attractive Tiffany Case, who he develops a serious thing for.The diamond smuggling happens by dentist and a few other tricks. Felix Leiter lends a hand, now out of the CIA due to the shark bite problems, and working privately."
3,Bond vs. The Spagled Mob,"There are a few slow parts in the story, but I overall enjoyed it more than I did reading Moonraker, which is the novel before this one. In this novel, Bond goes to America so he can find who is smuggling diamonds there from Africa. While doing so, he becomes involved with the mob and meets a beautiful woman named Tiffany Case. That's the basic story, which is completely different from the movie once again.If you are into stories about the mafia, then this book is definitely something that you should pick up and read. If you are not interested in criminal activity such as the mob, then this will probably not appeal to you as much. But if you are like me, you are planning to read all of the Fleming Bond novels anyway. Overall, a good story but not the best in the series."
3,Just Not That Exciting,"One almost gets the impression that both Ian Fleming and Bond were coasting on their reputations in this book. The plot is about comparatively low stakes for a spy novel, the pace is leisurely, Bond is oddly passive (Felix Leiter and Tiffany Case save the day as often as Bond does) and not particularly clever (at one point he almost blows his mission because he apparently got bored waiting for something to happen to move it along), and the villains and action sequences are just not that memorable, at least not in a good way. Strangely enough, that means that the book suffers in comparison both to the movie (which, while hardly five-star, had some quirky, memorable moments) and John Gardner's later Bond novels, which dig deeper into both the characters and the settings of the world of 007. While not actively bad, DAF does little to show you why Bond became a literary or cultural phenomenon. Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion."
2,Kinda Goofy,"Not much can be said about the literary merits of ""Diamonds are Forever"". You read it because it's the original conception of an iconic fictional character. You read it for a quaint romp through 50s America as imagined by an Englishman. You read it to draw comparisons with the movie. Yet be warned, Bond doesn't really do much. The reader gets more details on Bond's eating, drinking, showering and napping habits than anything else. The ""mystery"" is on par with, say, a ""Rockford Files"" episode, conveniently solved before the final commercial break, the dialogue no more than a risque episode of ""Leave it to Beaver"". Overall it's a goofy and cute book, a harmless way to spend an afternoon."
2,Definitely not the best Bond,"If you're new to Bond, start with Casino Royale or Moonraker, two gems. Diamonds are Forever had some high points, but way too much slow-paced action, description of what Bond is eating, pointless scenes that have you skimming pages to get to the point, etc. Nothing like the gripping tension of the aforementioned two volumes."
3,I don't know,"This book is dull, has only a bit action, a totally undeveloped heroine... But come on, it's only Fleming's second book from 1954! Perhaps I have too much of those Roger Moore-movies on my mind!"
2,"Glad I don't have to wait for ""From Russia With Love""","Of all of Ian Fleming's novels -- this is the worst.I am an avid fan of Fleming (and Benson), but this particular novel did nothing for me. A weak villian (an American mobster) and two homosexual assains are not in the same league as SMERSH or SPECTRE.There was a good casino scene in this book (come on, Fleming is the master of the casino scene), but the horse racing was weak.Tiffany Case was an excellent, strong character (not accurately portrayed in the movies). Felix Leiter was great reprising his role (although no long with the American CIA).But, like I stated earlier, I'm glad I don't have to wait a year before the publishing of Fleming's masterpiece -- ""From Russia With Love."""
4,Fun untill the end.,"I've been reading the Bond books in succession and so far this is the one that has made me the most hungry for a late night snack. It's good to see Bond brake away from martinis to enjoy a Miller Highlife. This book gives the best glimpse of Bond at leasure. Traveling from England to Las Vegas with a stop in New York State, Bond has time to enjoy food, women and horse racing. This has been the best at comparing Bond's style with Amercan style of late 50's. Fleming's view of gangsters is closer to Damon Runyon than Mario Puzo. It is all fun but turns anticlimactic in the end. The book could have ended when they get on the Queen Mary."
4,Birthday gift for my 9 year old daughter,I bought the gameboy advance for my daughter this year for her nineth birthday and she loves it. She can take it in the car with her and just about anywhere she pleases because there are no cords and there is an on/off switch for the volume. It certainly is a good choice for a boredom buster!
4,"Good game, But I do not play","Actually I purchased game for my kids, and they are too yeung to comment on it. So since the game doesn't give hard time to me, I would say its very good."
4,great graphics and convenient gameplay,"I had been meaning to buy this system to take on trips and when we lost power I finally took the plunge. Boy am I glad I did. This thing has very good graphics and sophisticated gameplay with plenty of entertaining titles. Many of the games look and play just like they did on my Super Nintendo back in the early 90's. The controller ergonomics are good as well. My only complaint is the lack of lighting for the screen. Sure I could have gotton the SP, but with no power at home I had no way to initially charge the batteries. Also, I plan to take this on week-long bareboat charters in the Caribbean with no AC power available. The SP's 10-18 hour battery life would not be enough. I tried a clip on magnifier/light but it did not work well at all. My advice is to get a headband flashlight that are used by hikers/climbers for lighting the screen. Yeah you will look like a nerd, but you will be too engrossed in your game to care."
4,Radio Transcription Collection,"This is a UK release of rare radio transcription recordings. Most appear to be from ""Guest Star"" and the ""Club 51"" radio program from the late 1940's. This is an opportunity to hear the Sisters take on ""Sentimental Journey"" and ""Accentuate the Positive"" without Bing Crosby. The radio performance of ""Sabre Dance"" on this album is better than the Decca studio recording. The cover drawing of the Sisters is a bit strange - LaVerne looks like Joan Crawford! A keeper for Andrews Sisters collectors."
5,Creepy Cute with lessons,"I think this is a great cartoon that has a cute creepy twist on everyday life of a preteen with good lessons to be learned. Fun animation too, doesn't feel cheap."
3,Expected a lot more.,"After reading the ""good"" reviews for this book, I waited with high anticipation to read it for myself. However, I was really disappointed with the entire outcome. This book would have been better off as a short story, say 1/3 the pages. The entire middle section is bland, boring, and drawn out. It isn't until the last several chapters where it really starts to pick up. The ending did bring back feeling of my own childhood, but other than that, I felt I was kept waiting and waiting for something to REALLY happen, anything to happen. I guess I'm also not used to an english writer. I'm much more used to writing styles of Orson Scott Card, and his Ender's series. If there were half stars, I would really make this book a 2 and 1/2 star review and not even three."
3,"Disappointing, though engagingly written","This story kept my interest until the last 30 pages when I realized there really was no point to it except to tell the coming of age story of 4 kids growing up in England. The tooth fairy simply appears to one of them, Sam, early in the book, when Sam was 7 or so, but without explanation. Perhaps it would have been nice to have some basis as to why they occured. But, from my reading anyway, no explanation is ever offered.After that there are a series of interesting vignettes involving each of the kids, all tied together by the tooth fairy, who takes on various incarnaions, including that of a kind of succubus. The characters are richly realized and the book is well written. That deserves the 3 stars. But as far as ultimately satisfying the reader, I think it falls short."
4,The Tooth Fairy is a Good One to Cut Your Teeth On...,"There are few novels that multitask elements of the truly strange, coming of age, humor, and horror...this one manages quite nicely. The easiest way to put this is that the Tooth Fairy is for novels what Donnie Darko was for film."
5,Better than Flossing,"I loved this book. Let me say it again: I LOVED THIS BOOK.TOR, which also put out the wonderful Dawn Song, has proven again that they are way ahead of the curve when it comes to horror. There are a lot of people that will say this isn't a horror novel, but it is. Horror has changed. Pack up the vampires, put the monsters back under the bed, and leave the slashers to the movies. The Tooth Fairy is a much more intraverted novel that requires the reader to question the sanity of the main character and the reality of the book.The book was like a trip back to high school. It has all the sexual uncertainty, drama, fear, and life that is lacking from Dawson's Creek. I really became attached to these characters and hated to see the book end."
2,Not quite the Thrill book I was lookin for,"This was an interesting book if you are looking to get into the heads of male youths. However, it is not a thriller or horror novel in the least. Thre were times when I skimed through paragraphs looking for more excitment. Book is also based in Europe, so some language and references were missed by me. I don't think I would recommend this book if you are looking for excitment or thrills."
3,"Pretty good, nice twist at the end","I had a hard time giving this book just three stars. It's really quite good, but there are parts that just didn't seem to have much to do with the rest of the story. When you read the book, you'll know which ones I mean.Overall, this is a coming of age story, following the lives of three boys. At times it is scary, and at times it is fall down funny.The twist at the end of the book is a huge redeeming factor though, and it makes me want to say go out and pick this one up."
1,poor book,I thought the book lacked any real substance and was poorly written. It was a real let down. The story had so much potential and the author did nothing of any importance with it. what a dumb book.
5,the pull your tooth fairy,"we thoroughly enjoyed this book...dear lovers of fairy lore,... which kept us interested from beginning to end. The Tooth Fairy here is not your usually sort. Its own teeth are razor sharp and it is, we suspect, more likely to pull your teeth than wait for them to come out. A young British lad in this modern urban fantasy, just coming of age, finds his life quite affected, both positively and negatively, by his encounters with this creature, and it makes for fascinating reading. It just goes to show it is not wise to have all our wishes granted.We loved this novel and suspect you will, too.kyela,the silver elves"
5,Great product!!,I have a puddle mix dog and my dogs hair is like human hair which is very difficult to find something that will work for her. I am so glad that I had found this product because after I had use it! My dogs hair feels smooth and easy to manage while brushing.
1,"Awful, awful sound... had to return two of them","These Dynex cassette adapters were once good products -- I've owned a couple of them in the past. But, like all of these cassette adapters, the thin cord eventually goes bad and you have to replace them.Which is just what I did recently. But... Dynex must have produced a LARGE bad batch of these, because the new one I got was awful. Loud hissing and droning came from the speakers, and the volume coming from the iPod was so low that I had to turn the volume on the tape deck up all the way to even hear it... which made the hissing, droning background noise overpowering.Obviously it was defective. But when I returned it and exchanged it for another one, the new one had the same problem.Dynex, get some quality control and fix these things!"
1,Avoid at all costs.,"After my Sony CPA9C broke, I decided to get a new cassette adapter.Immediately, I notice that everything is written to the middle eq channel in my car. There was no treble to speak of, and as an emulated bass, there was an audible flapping sound whenever there was a beat of any kind.I would seriously avoid this product at all costs.Also, we need the option for a zero-star."

2,Waste of Time and Money,"Ok first thing first, I didn't expect much considering the product cost a penny before shipping but I expected it to work! I guess that was asking too much! I received the product fast and in the condition it was purchased (at least this part was good, hence the two stars). I popped this adapter in and two things happened. The first, even though the instructions say to have your ipod at half volume I had to have it almost all the way up to hear it at a decent volume. The second is the product crapped out after two days, two days!! Now it only plays out of one side of my car despite anything I do. And for those skeptics, yes I tried all sorts of tests to make sure to was the adapter. Here are the main two, radio and cd player work fine and I went to Wal-Mart and bought a new Phillips brand adapter for only a couple bucks more than this faulty product was after shipping and it works fine so far. I think you can figure out which product was the odd man out."
4,Works fine,"I am not sure what the previous reviewer was so upset about.My wife's Highlander Hybrid happened to come with a cassette player and we have had spotty results with the MP3 converter which plays through a radio (which is a totally stupid idea anyway. Is this the stone ages? I have to use a radio channel where I can get interference with a real radio station is? Hello? Give me a USB slot where I can directly plug in my Ipod!)Anyway, I tried it this morning, everything sounded fine to me, but I will qualify that by saying I am not one of those heart thumping bass people who always pull up next to me at a stoplight.The only objection I have is that I will also now need to use a charger since all this does is send the headphones through the cassette into my car radio and isn't charging."
3,Nothing New,"Well i saw anna on a video from a woonsocket, RI (USA) club and was totally impressed with her guitar virtuosity. very much reminded me of hendrix and rory gallagher amoung others. this cd however was a disapointment. it's very much packaged material and the sound production is awful. i'm a drummer and so i'm always keen to the drum sound. this cd pretty much loses the edge and excitement that drumming typcially adds to rock and blues. the songs are enjoyable in general and she can emulate some great artists with her voice also (joan armatrading for one). i would like to get a live recording hoping that there's more soulfulness and spark in the music."
3,Hmmmm,"In a few spots, she may be beginning to find ""her sound"" or ""her voice,"" but in my opinion, most of it sounds like she's in sort of a Tinsley Ellis meets Deborah Coleman mode. A bit over-produced and ""busy"" overall.Ana, give us your version of some stripped-down Delta or Chicago blues in your next effort. At least a coupla tunes each... show us you can hold back and let the music rip our hearts out.Please lose the chorus pedal."
3,good band poor vocals.,I wish there was some way to listen to just the band and take out the vocals. don't like the voice. don't care for the subject of the songs. Might be better if she could get somebody else to front as vocalist or maybe a guy to duet with her. Probably won't buy anymore of her records.
5,Great pond fish food.,"Have been using Tetra Pond Floating Pond Sticks for 7 years.The Goldfish and Koi have been doing great with this food.Its fun to watch the sticks get attacked as soon as they hit the water.Buying Tetra Pond Floating Pond Sticks in the 11 pound box, instead of the small bag at the local store,cuts my cost in half on buying pond food.It comes in two sealed bags inside the box with ties to close the bags up after opening."
3,Forbidden Kingdom,"Good Jet Li/Jackie Chan movie. Not GREAT, but good. Could have been a lot more, with these two action stars, but I think it was too commercialized. Worth while buy, but didn't quite meet all my expectations."
3,It's a fantasy kungfu movie for kids.,The fighting scenes are not exciting as other movies starring Jet Li or Jackie Chan. It's not as funny as other films by Jackie either.It's worth watching once.
4,Forbidden Kingdom,Lots of action and it makes you laugh as well. I would recommend seeing this one. It is very entertaining and lots of fun to watch.
4,Forbidden Kingdom,"Good, funny movie! Excellent video and sound, as well as special features. A great movie to add to anyone's collection."
4,"Great product, mildly damaged package","The movie itself is a great buy if you are looking for an excellent copy of the movie with all the goodies such as blooper reels and so forth that we come to expect. However, my case had been punctured by something, though the outer packaging was fine, so I don't believe it was damaged in shipping. Otherwise, excellent buy for the money."
4,Good action movie,"One of my favorite movies that I watched in 2008. It was unique enough that I bought the DVD for it, I am huge fan of martial arts/action movies and this one has a lot of it."
5,Wow! Jet Li and Jackie Chan in a Great Story!,"I have always laughed at the stiffness of some of the martial arts films of the 60's and 70's, but this film is anything but stiff. Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and the other primary actors in this film have made a truly enjoyable film, and the story flows so well. I have watched it again and again!"
4,Great Action Movie,"I think people should not be taking this movie seriously. I think the story line is too far fetch (to connect somebody from New Jersey to ancient China) but the actions are awesome. It's an ""OK"" spin off from the story ""Journey to the West."""
5,great buy!!!!,was what i expected!!! was needed and will be using!!!! was what i expected!!! was needed and will be using!!!!
3,Hmm...,"The trailers for this movie made it look awesome, but unfortunately, trailers usually take the best clips of the film and hide the worst. This movie isn't awful, but it is not really worth buying, just renting.It's like a East meets West thing with the main protagonist being a teenager who has to fulfill a prophecy and return this magical staff to the Monkey King - but honestly, this movie would have been much better without a Western element. The main character would have been just fine if he were a Chinese boy (or girl, whatever)The best actor in this movie was the evil warlord. I especially liked his clothing, with all the intricate goldwork. Jackie Chan and the white-haired witch were also decent actors, but the Warlord was the best, and this movie would have been way better if not for some dorky American teenager who just happened to get sucked into this universe of the Forbidden Kingdom over some staff."
4,Good picture transfer,"Good fantasy film in the spirit of ""The Never Ending Story"" that goes back and feature an old Chinese monkey king and the golden staff mythical story. The chase and shooting at the beginning in Boston is something I skip for the my kids, but rest are great.The blu-ray picture is clear and good quality. Audio decoded decently as I can hear the placement with the surround sound. Good value for blu-ray collectors for approximately $11."
3,The Forbidden Kingdom,"This Edition DVD was not good quality formatt like 2 disc special edition, quite disappointed."
5,It's my favorite movie!!!,This movie was great and my favorite two kung fu actors come out here. that was excellent. Jackie chan and Jet Li combined Kung Fu legend and they are still perfect doing their movies. This movie CGI was great. The fighting scenes were excellent. This movie was enjoying and laughing.
3,Good fantasy entertainment,"I remember enjoying the movie, It is a relatively well done family fantasy. It dose not leave anything, In fact Im having a hard time recalling the story a few weeks after watching it.It still does give you a couple of hours of entertainment and what more do you want from a movie."
2,Ho-hum,"Somehow, the charismatic Jackie Chan and the charismatic Jet Li combine their charisma to, what? cancel each other out. Sad but true. The film is leaden, earth-bound. The romance element is unbelievable; the callow stripling becomes kung fu master in two-minute montage is as ridiculous as ever; the villains are merely unpleasant; the fights are--well, you've seen them all before many times. One thing I haven't noticed in the other reviews: the soundtrack, specifically the choral music, is deafening, even to the point of making the dialog unintelligible in spots. Finally, I believe firmly that wire-assisted flying in martial arts films is grotesquely over-used. It should surprise and amaze; it should not be routine and commonplace."
1,"Lame, lame, lame.","Lame action movie starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li that combines fantasy and kung-fu, and fails at both."
1,One of the worst film of the year,This is one of the worst films of the year. I cannot believe both Jet Li and JC would allow such an amateur director to be involved with a such a production.
4,Awesome movie,This is a great movie. It kept my 2 1/2 year old glued to the TV the whole time. And he can barely sit through 1/2 cartoon but wouldn't budge from this movie. Great for quality quiet time with a toddler.
4,Good movie,"The Forbidden Kingdom contains ancient martial arts, good storyline, Taoist wisdom, and supernatural abilities. It has great special effects and costumes. I like all of this so I enjoyed this movie. If you like this as well, you will probably enjoy this movie too."
4,"The Forbidden Kingdom, a delightful little movie","The Forbidden Kingdom is a delightful little fantasy movie. With a creative story line and impressive sets, you'll fine yourself drawn in to the action and caring about the colorful characters. It may not have done will on the big screen but it's a perfect fit for an evening in front of the TV for any fantasy lover."
4,Martial Arts Lover,I am a big fan of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. The martial arts reminds you of the old days of Kung Fu movies and it was quite funny.
1,"Bought because of high rating - but was duped. BAD, Cheesy and boring","I bought this according to all the great reviews. I also figured that since Jet Li was in it that I could overlook Jackie Chan. Nothing against Jackie Chan's skills, just his acting and choice of films which I have never enjoyed.BO-RING. Cheesy bad, all around insulting to kung fu fan's everywhere. I figured if I fast forwarded to the fight scene with Li/Chan that I would at least feel like I didn't waste my money on this. I figured wrong. It was an exercise in annoyance.It makes me wonder if all these reviews are fake. I've always trusted Amazon. I bought this on Amazon based on the reviews which I question now if they are legitimate or just people paid to give a good review who probably didn't pay for the dvd like I did. I feel duped."
2,The language is just horrible.,"You can't just translate the Chinese language into english word by word. I was listening to all kinds of Chinese proverbs in English throughout the movie and it was unbearable. Chinese people don't speak like that; they don't use proverbs in all their daily talking. I can't stand it when Jackie Chan uses the words ""civil examination"". What does it mean? The script is horrible. It got two stars instead of one because the fight scenes are good in general."
3,fine,The disc was disconnected from the case when I received it. I had to open the dvd (It was a gift for someone else) to reset it in place. There were fine scratches on the disc from being shakes around during the shipping process.
1,hodge podge of unrelated storylines,"This movie is a disgrace and an insult to the chinese literature ""journey to the west"". I've seen movies the deviates from the original book, but this one massacres it. not only that, it tried to dress the rest of the story up with ""a kid in king arthur's court"", and other non-related lines. They then throw in Jet Li and Jacky Chan in there and expect to make it great. I've never seen so many soldiers in full battle armour chasing after a suspect in the winehouse. Whole movie does not make sense!"
2,What a TERRIBLE rehash of two 80's movies.,"Okay- take the Movie's core as it is- the Jackie Chan and Jet Li part. Fine Kung Fu flick. No problems with that. Then- mix in an almost laughable combo of Never Ending Story with Karate Kid. I guess if I were 12 or 13 this would be fine- I wouldn't know it's a knock off, but being a child of the 80's this movie was painful to sit through. And I can't see why they did it- the movie would have been fine without this terrible sub-plot line of 'the boy who gets bullied by the meanies at school and then gets transported to a magic world to learn Kung Fu and save a world from the evil... blah blah blah'.If it comes on HBO- watch it for free- but if you're over 28... don't get creeped out by thinking you've seen this movie before. But better."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"I'll make this short, I like to watch the movies I rent, this movie was sooo bad I had to turn it off. It was very corny, predictable, not excitable, terrible ""special effects"", fighting scenes were terrible.I myself am white, but what the duse is the deal with the white guy??? So not fitting with the story.QUICK RUN DOWN, DO NOT WATCH!!! This will probably get deleted by Amazon, but if you are over the age of 9, avoid this movie."
4,A pleasant surprise,"This pleasantly written fairy tale takes the best of the gong fu genre and makes use of allegory to deliver a message on many levels.I recommend it highly, and some day I would love to me Mr. Jacky Chan.Best,Dr. Nicholas A. Sceusa"
4,Whimsical flick,It reminded me of a wizard of oz on steroids. The weak guy finding out his strength was all insideall along.OMG jackie chan with dreads and his jokes were cool. Got to see two of my favs in onefilm. Jet -li tricked me at first. I didn't know he was the monkey king. Over
2,It's OK,"The actors are good but the story is weak. The fighting throughout the film is good, but I just couldn't get into the story."
5,Great Movie,Had a lot of culture and left me wanting to see more. A lot more of the movies to follow this one.
1,too bad,"just 20 pages. i dont know how people sales this products. It was a mistake. 20 pages is not enough information. and the 25% of the pages are index, licence comments and warranty explains. I hope this message alert you for not to buy."
5,......KING TURF....You Said It......,....An earlier film about the Sport of Kings...good tale...good acting...and when will some Hollywood sharpshooter transfer this movie to DVD??...SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF
1,Offending,"A large number of people have said that this series is good for people of all faith. They are wrong. As a jew, I thought that this series was highly offensive. Christians can read it if they want to (though why not just read a bible) but it is guaranted to tick off anyone who is non-Christian. Just like the ""official"" Left Behind Series."
5,The League,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loved it! I would definitely buy something similar.
4,Love this show!,I just discovered this show recently and love it! it is so funny and over the top! You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy it. The things the friends do and say to each other are so hilarious! There are some fall off the couch laughing episodes
3,Average at best,"I downloaded The League (both Season 1 & 2) to pass time on a trans-Pacific flight, and it barely satisfied my expectation.The characters are interesting, but the plot lines are terrible. Definitely not what I was expecting, being a fantasy football playing 30 something.If you find yourself in a position with nothing else to watch/do, The League will suffice. I'd just advise looking a little harder for something more interesting."
2,Kinda okay,I ordered this product and the arrival time was nice and short. However when I opened the package the plastic wrapping also tore off the plastic cover of the DVD case. Also the DVDs don't exactly play very well. I've tried them in a number of different DVD players but nothing seems to work.
5,Great Season!,"This was a great second season of The League, every bit as funny as Season 1! The Blu-Ray is great quality with lots of great features. I'd highly recommed for anyone who loves fantasy football and trash-talking with friends!"
3,Paul Newman,"Enjoy Paul Newman. It is maybe 3+. The ""Harper"" character always seemed to fit him. Hombre is probably my favorite. Indicates how our ""liberals"" today always get us into trouble."
4,Drowning Pool,"All star cast, particularly the character actors. Wish there could be another Harper sequel. At least three Academy Award winners in the cast: Newman, Woodward, and Jaekel."
2,not the animation i was looking for,"the story was similar, but the animation was not. I still cannot find the one I watched as a child."
5,Good deal on refurbished unit,"We had a unit just like this (no brand name, but essentially the same unit). After about 10 years, something failed in the electronics.Desperate, I went to Fry's Electronics and bought another tape based time lapse VCR - for $250. When I got home, before opening the box, I thought ""Amazon.""Sure enough, I found this unit, refurbished, for a lot less. It even came with a remote, which I don't use, but icing on the cake. I returned the unopened unit to Fry's. This unit arrived a week later. (I think Amazon must drag things out for free shipping, but hey...)It works fine. No complaints.Most everyone is moving to Hard Drive based units, but I needed a tape unit at a remote location so I could bring tapes home to see what had been happening. (Tip: if you have a 4 head VCR, it will replay the time lapse tapes just fine. In the 18H mode, anyway.)"
4,Honey Bee Biology and Beekeeping,"This excellent book mirrors the teachings of the author, that one must understand the biology of the honey bee in order to comprehend its behavior. This book not only encompasses facts but also provides topics for further discussion, thus leading to further inquiry into the fascinating world of honey bees."
2,Did not work for me,"Well, I am sorry to say this did not work for me. I am 30yrs of age and have suffered with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) almost all my life. I was able to function until I got a really, really, bad c. diff infection in my intestines last year. Even when I finally got rid of the infection, I still continued to have horrible diarrhea and cramping. It seemed to make my IBS more severe. Since then, I have seen doctors, tried many medications, and even tried some alternative therapies, and nothing has yet been helping me so far. A co-worker of my husbands recommended RevitalX and I tried it. It seemed to make my diarrhea worse! It cleans you out. Now if you are someone who suffers with daily constipation, this would probably work great for you! It mixes well and doesn't taste too bad."
2,not the same,"We have used this particular screw for several years in our business.It is used in a very specific manner and these screws just receivedare not the same, and are adversely affecting our product. The threadsdo not go all the way to the base of the head of the screw as they should;instead there is a space. We will have to find another outlet for thescrews we need."
5,Great artwork,"A really cute way to display the alphabet for your child and support the fun of reading. I could definitely see it in a library somewhere. Each letter is made up of people in different positions, most reading a books."
4,"Very nice, surprisingly inventive.","The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it was longer. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it but I was very pleasantly surprised. There are some truly brilliant shots in this book, including the best pictures of Kate Moss I've ever seen (I don't normally find her that attractive, but Lindbergh works his magic). If you like fashion, photography or supermodels, this is a great place to start. While there is very little writing, the pictures speak for themselves and are very creative. After looking through this, I can't wait to see Lindbergh's upcoming book."
1,Peter Makes A Quik Buck....,"I own hundreds of books on fashion, the nude, glamour, beauty etc. I am myself a fashion photographer and publish a series on digital nude work I do. I found this book to be extremely bland. It was very economical, but believe me, it was too much. Peter has a lot better material out, and I think this book was just published on the merits of the subject matter and the name of the photographer. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Images of top models...but is that enough,"The layout of this 1996 printed hardover book is nice and the fact that all images, except one of Kate Moss are monochrome makes it worth purchasing.However there is some disappointment in seeing the thumbnail images on the inner endpages and not finding several of the striking plates on the actual pages.The pictures themselves, at least most of them are a tribute to the transformability of the ten models and the technique of the photographer.I wonder what the pictures would have looked like with ""ordinary"" people in the exact same poses?"
5,Amazing insights,Kenneth Bailey is one of my all-time favorite scholars. I am a biblical storyteller and this book changed the way I tell the Prodigal parable - as well as giving me great insights into the story of Jacob and all of Jesus' ministry. Read it!
5,Unsung Scholar.,THe books by Kenneth Bailey are the best in their genre and I have learnt much from reading them. I would recommend them to anyone wishing a deeper understanding of the roots of christianity and how that impacts on us today. Jim Bussau
1,not what i expected,"I was looking for something a bit more factual based, and historic, with the Hebraicness restored to the tale...as well as the ties of this parable from Messiah TO the People of Israel.This book did absolutly nothing for me but cause me to shake my head...typical non-Hebraic roots jargon from Modern Christianity instead of original Historical Christianity.No gold nuggets in the book. I say ""don't buy."" Completely wasted my money."
5,Great collection of WW2 games,"This World War 2 collection of games is the best. Battlefield 1942 is fun,both single player and multiplayer.Medal of Honor:Aliied Assault has one of the best WW2 levels of all WW2 games:Omaha Beach. Secrets Weapons over Normandy is one of the best WW2 airplane shooters.Overall, this collection of games is the best."
5,Like Nothing Else Before or Since,"Black Monk Time is definitely a 60s garage record, but it doesn't sound like a 60s garage record. It doesn't sound like anything that came before, and it sure as hell doesn't sound like anything since. There's really no describing this record in a just way; you just have to experience it.One of the ""best"" and ""most important"" records ever made. No freakin' joke."
4,"Never mind the bollocks,this is avant-garde rock'n'roll.","Yes,it's like nothing you've heard before,but it isn't garage and it certainly isn't punk;any Sex Pistols fan who checks out this CD hoping to find the original punk recording is going to be dumbfounded (as well as disappointed.)The Monks play aggressive,fun,rock and roll,but these musicians are no ""three-chord-wonders,""and their music is much more cerebral than garage rock.Although they did have a caustic sense of humor and definite (punk) anti-social tendencies,and they were ahead of their time,the Monks might just as easily be classified as ""Progressive-Banjo-Jazz-Rock""."
1,losers,"I FOUND THIS CD WAS JUST ABSOLUTE CRAP, I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I READ MOST OF THE REVIEWS THAT WERE ON THE SITEIN REAL TERMS AND YES LETS GET REAL THEY ARE JUST 5 LOUDMOUTHED YANKS TRYING , I SAID TRYING TO SOUND AS GOOD AS THE ENGLISH BANDS OF THEIR TIME.I LOVE MUSIC FROM THE 60S BUT THIS ONE IS TERRIBLE, IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU, YOU CAN;T LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS THESE MORONIC PEOPLE WRITE , LETS FACE IT, MOST OF THOSE THAT PUT IN REVIEWSDON;T TRY AND BE PART OF THE SIXTIES BECAUSE MOST OF YOU MISSED IT."
4,GREAT,And I say it again.... GREAT!After stumbling upon these guys I see why so many folks wonder why they are not given more attention.
5,Great for Armadillos,"I have used this product for armadillos with great success. I followed label directions and got instant results, no sign of armadillos since the first application."
1,"After reading the instructions, I decided I could not afford it.",The repeated use and restricted use by what the container would cover was misleading. It is still in the container and I have used other mains for eliminating the pest I was experiencing.Thanks but no thanks.Patricia Hiers
4,Shake Away,"Item arrived promptly but with lid that did not fit. Upon notification, seller promptly gave credit for defect in cap. I was most pleased with the response and credit."
1,Doesn't work- guarantee not honored either,"I used an entire 20-oz container according to the directions, and deer were not fazed. They continued to munch on my willow tree as if they enjoyed being surrounded by these granules. Information about the money-back guarantee was supposed to be found on the company's web site, but it was not mentioned."
1,Conflicting claims about safety,"This product is advertised as 100% safe and non-toxic, but the precautionary statements on the bottle conflict with that. It says to ""call a poison control center"" if it comes in contact with skin OR clothing (and, of course, if swallowed or gotten in eyes). It also mentions ""hazards to domestic animals"" even though the description on amazon claims it will not harm household pets OR the animal you are repelling.I'm too nervous to use it and will be returning it.****Update: amazon won't let me return it (due to ""health and safety reasons,"" ironically), although they did give me a refund. Unfortunately, I will probably have to make a special trip to the local hazardous waste facility to get rid of it, per instructions on the bottle. So if you are buying it based on the claims that it's ""safe and non-toxic,"" don't!!"
2,Deer Away,"Product simply does not work as advertised, when used as advertised. Advertisement states ""Shake-Away deer is a powder made of coyote urine"", though no urine is listed in ingredients. Urea is listed and is NOT urine. Urea is a nitrogen-containing waste-by-product contained in urine (dog, people, coyote, etc) and is used as a nitogen source in fertilizer. Urine would contain urea, other waste products, pheromones etc. that would let deer know that other animals were in the area. Urea does NOTHING except fertilize your property."
4,Raccoons Missing!!,"Could not believe raccoons {and opossoms} in Brooklyn! I did not mind them up in the trees but I feared for little dog. Should a raccoon come into the yard she would have been after it...a fight she'd likely lose. The Shake Away seems to have run them away...no sightings in weeks!4 stars because I believed it was safe around pets and children, container stated otherwise, use gloves to spread it."
5,Want to build an airport? This is the book to start learning from!,"Wonderful textbook for Airport Systems and Planning. Very concise, with lots of cases cited as examples. Information is presented without being written in language that is too technical to understand, so the book is very easy to read and understand without much prior knowledge on the subject matter."
5,A Gift That Keeps Giving,This collection of poetry will keep on giving to anyone interested in the power of poetry to sustain and inspire or in the fragile and humane work of teaching. At first I read it cover to cover. Since I've been called back many times to certain poems or stories. Each poem is accompanied by a short story about what the particular poem has meant to the teacher who submitted it. Sometimes it's hard to tell which is more powerful--the poem or the teacher's story. In this little volume lie the seeds of true school reform! Read it and pass it on.
5,REVIEW,"The book not only has poetry by many wonderful poets, the book is compiled by teachers of all paths who each have chosen a book that inspires them. They have also written a brief backstory as to why they selected the poem they did. As a yoga teacher I often share poetry with my classes, this book is always successful as there is something in it for everyone, the back stories are appreciated by all."
5,A Great Companion,"This book is a great companion for my public speaking. I have borrowed from it, especially when I present to teachers. An inspirational read. A great gift for any teacher.Wheel of Initiation: Practices for Releasing Your Inner Light"
3,Ok but print is only on one side,"I don't believe the item was misrepresented in any way but since it was sold as a ""Street Sign"" I was disappointed to find it was only one-sided. Street signs have their print on both sides. so I assumed this would too. I would likely not have purchased this item due to this as it has little value as-is."
3,A fun romp through fantasy!,"Falcon, at age 13, is reluctant to face the reality of her life -one that is filled with magic, dragons, witches and saints and all things of fantasy. But when her Aunt Emily (who is over one hundred years old) suffers a heart attack, the reluctant Falcon must rely on magic to save her aunt's life.When Falcon, Aunt Emily (as her young self) and Allie Cadwallader-Newton (who has been a time traveler) go back in time to New York City in the year 1903, they must rely on old friends to find their way home. Along the way there are grand adventures, difficult choices and a surprise ending.Luli Gray's Falcon and the Carousel of Time will intrigue and challenge the imaginations of children between the ages 10-14. It was a fun read but had an ending I didn't expect - and still don't know how I feel about. However, I recommend this book."
3,The game is ok but the company sucks,"I bought this game 2 weeks ago. There is no game codes in the box. I contacted the manufactory (Electronic Art) via email, website support, phone, and mail... They basically treats you like a scammer and keep you in a loop of email and website. I sent them the copy of receipt and barcode but got no answer. Buy this game at your own risk."
3,Samurai Empire in a nutshell,"Dig it! *Many* new items for crafters and housebuilders alike. Tons of new weapons and armor give UO a breath of fresh air. While I may have chosen a different theme for the expansion (C'mon guys! USE THE OPEN SEAS!!) the overall mood concerning the theme fits well. New music (bards get a bonus in this expansion! Not tellin!)The two new professions seem balanced, but could still require a little tweaking, but thats to be expected...new tameables for tamers, new stealables for ""crates"" and much more!Overall, I'd hafta say...BUY IT!"
3,A fast expansion before christmas with nothing innovative,"This new expansion will introduce japanese fiction into Ultima Online and maybe even some new fiction concerning it.Two new professions we do not know a lot about yet will be playable, namely Samurai and Ninjas. There will also be some additions to Ultimas best feature the housing system which may make it worthwhile for people to buy it.Graphically nothing will change and it remains a 6 year old game that lives of its good skillbased system that is very versatile.If you have never played UO and look for an interesting system where the game is what players make of it then give it a try.If you have played and seen it all then this expansion does not promise anything too new, as it looks like a ripoff their last expension AOS."
1,"Used to be fun, now its gone.","Due to wreckless game masters and constant customer abuse, I am closing my account with this game. STAY AWAY! Unspoken policies are abundant, and exist everywhere, making avoiding a ban like running from the gestapo!!!The game used to have a wonderful gameplay system, this expansion wrecked it. On top of that, it is being patched out of its time. Less new players are coming in, and more players are leaving. I suggest you all stay away from this title."
2,The Party Is Over,"Let me begin by saying I have been an avid citizen of Sosaria for 5 years and have had great experiences in this game and made many new friends.That being said, I think this franchise has run it's course. With all the newer and more advanced MMO's out now, this game just seems stuck in the past. EA got behind the power curve of new games like EQ2 and WoW. I haven't logged into UO since WoW came out, for some reason though I just can't seem to bring myself to close my account... :)"
4,Too big and clumsy,"Bought this but it was too big and clumsy for me (5'4""). It was never used and I had to buy another one that fit me better. Otherwise, it would have been a great bag."
3,"Easy to install, but won't last","This product was very easy to install, but it won't hold up very well to harsh winters. We've only had it about 2 years, and the bracket which supported the mailbox became rusty and weakened near the post. One good encounter with the snowplow this winter, and it was all over. The heavy snow caused the bracket to break right off. I don't think it is fixable."
1,don't buy this,"please, do yourself a favor, and don't throw your money away on this post. i purchased it to go with a solar heavy duty mailbox. the upright post is thin but probably sufficient for the purpose. however, the support post that actually holds the mailbox is too thin to do the job. this is especially true in my case, using a heavy duty box. not enough metal! cheap chinese design!"
5,Quality product.,"I placed my order of your mail box and post on a wednesday evening and delivery was on thursday, super fast. very easy to assemble and good quality. No problems recommended!!"
3,Mail Box Post,"The product came as scheduled, (Except for a delay due to the weather) The product was exactly as ordered and worked out just fine.Solar Group SDPK0000 Black Heavy-Duty Steel Drive-In Mailbox Post Kit"
2,Not Very Good,"I'm gonna have to say that this kid's book about a knight slaying dragons isn't very good. he artwork i not very good either, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to read."
2,"Pretty poor quality, even for $2.99...","I know. It sounds silly to even take the time to review a sticker. But, we are english bulldog fans and thought it'd be fun to put the sticker on the back window of our SUV. Anyway, even though the sticker is made of the typical vinyl-type material, the black is printed on it much like it would be on a regular sheet of paper. When I washed the back window, the black rubbed away. It was like the grime on the window scratched the black off so now the sticker looks shoddy and I'm going to peel it off. In my opinion, it would have been much better made had they simiply cut out the bulldog picture to let the tint from the back window show through - kind of like they do with the family stickers. Anyway, for $6, including shipping, it was a bit disappointing. That being said, if you want to place it in an area that is out of the elements, it probably would work fine for your purposes."
2,overpriced,"I bought this by accident, then decided to keep it. It's not terrible, it's simply mundane. At $3 it would rate three stars, but I expect a lot more for $14. If the price comes down and you're interested in Elizabeth don't expect a lot but go ahead and read it. At $14 it's a ripoff."
3,Not Oakie's best.,"I just bought this and maybe I'll get used to it, but the Oakenfold disc, although it has high points has too much music using the same note. (not key - note) It has one really bad transition toward the middle of the set. ""Yuck, what was that?""I own 6 or 7 Oakenfold albums (Tranceport, Voyage into.., (but not ""Resident"") and I still think ""Another World"" is his magnum opus.The Nick Warren disc has some good stuff. It's fun to listen to and has some trancey selections, too."
2,oakie's worst,"i just got this cd, popped it in the cd player expecting to here some good stuff like, tranceport, voyage into trance, and flouro. what i found was the same stuff over and over through out the whole cd. it was the worst investment in a Paul Oakenfold cd i have ever made, dont let the other reviews fool you. it is pure crap."
5,abraham lincoln,just love this old movie iam glade it came out on bluray and it is restored abraham lincoln was made back in 1930 but it looks like it was just for released for the movie theaters.
3,Deep? No... But Not The Kiddie Pool,"Eric Maisel turns in a decent effort here-- one that is worth a read. He as an easy, readable style and an obvious love of the craft. Not much in the way of brand-new insight to be found in these pages, however... except for a few goofy exercise straight out of the therapist's office (Mr. Maisel, in addition to being a writer, is a creativity therapist or something along those lines).Nonetheless, the ideas he does retread - respect the craft, nurture your ideas, etc.-- bear repeating. And let's face it, even a single fresh perspective on an old truth can be valuable.. and you're apt to find at least a couple here."
1,Not even worth the low price!,"I had these boots for less than a year when the heal became loose from the base of the shoe. I tried having them repaired and it happened again. I thought these were very stylish, with such a great price. In the end I wish I just spent a little more money and got a quality boot. When I bought these I also purchased 2 other pairs of boots by Rampage and since then I have had the same quality experience: 3 pairs of boots, in the trash!"
4,Great Boot,"This is a great boot and better yet at a great price. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I think it could have more tread or ridges on the bottom to prevent sliding in the snow,but I haven't had any problems as of yet. Also, no need to size up unless you're in between then I'd size up not down."
5,Nice!,"These boots are just what I was looking for. They look expensive without being expensive. They have the in-style pointed toe, but it isn't too pointy (just right). They are comfortable around the leg, too! Of course, I paid $30 so I wasn't expecting genuine leather/super high quality. I was expecting what I got and I am very pleased!!!"
1,Not what I was waiting for,All boot is made with mademan materials. Then they are not as comfortable as I want. With the same amount you can find a better option.
3,Ok if you don't plan on walking,"I love the look of these boots and bought them to replace a worn pair I had in my closet however, the sole is very thin and cracked in half during a ten minute walk across campus. If you buy these for the value, invest in a pair of inserts."
4,Rampage Trish,I like the boot. They run big so order .5 smaller. I usually wear and 8 but ordered a 7.5 and they are perfect. Great price for this boot.
1,Too hard!,Inside of shoe has no soft cushion and very hard on feet. Not comfortable and could not wear them at all!
1,Should sell these for cheap,While I found these for a rock bottom price.....I will never purchase again. The sole cracked in half and I have only had them 1 year. Considering I only wear them during the winter season not a value for the money. Go figure by the time I finally broke them in to where they were comfortable...
4,Nice for the price,Purchased these last year. They run a bit large. I purchased my usual shoe size but am able to wear these with medium thick socks. They are comfortable for brief walking. Not for snow or very cold weather. Nice stylish look with long skirts or leggings.
3,"Some Good, but Some Not-so Good","Some of the songs on this CD are really cool (like Imagining and If U Were my Man) and make you want to sing with sarah. Then again, some other songs (like French Kissing and Undressed) are not that good. Maybe this is just my opinion, but that's what I think."
3,Meh,"When I first started watching Haven, i couldn't wait til the next episode. Now I'm kind of over it. It feels repetitive. The character's aren't that great (although I do love Duke ... he is what saves the show). Personally, I wouldn't waste my money again, I would prob just watch on netflix or hulu..."
2,"Packaging is horrid, show is awesome","the way the disks fit into the holders is terrible! You have to bend the disks just to make them fit and I live in fear that I will snap a disk in half if I am not super careful. This has to be the worst disk packaging I have ever seen, and I own MANY DVDs and Bluerays. The 2 stars is for the packaging.... the show in its self is amazing and I would give it 4 stars if there was a spot just for the show its self."
5,Totally Absorbing,I almost passed it by but the music got my attention. I wanted to see if the haunting theme carried over to the program. I was not disappointed. I think the chemistry between the characters was very well done. I liked the mixture of mystery and humor. I thoroughly enjoy watching this every week and can't wait to see each new episode. Syfi has a winner here.
4,Haven Fan,"Thoroughly enjoyed the first series of Haven. Characters develop well throughout the episodes and one can always be guaranteed to ""expect the unexpected."" Looking forward to the release of Series 2."
5,Surprisingly good,"I wasn't expecting much from a Syfy show but I was very pleasantly surprised with this. The underlying ""theme"" is intriguing and I especially like the young woman that stars. She's given snappy, believable and witty dialog, she's a very likable character and the story arc is pretty fascinating. Not to mention the scenery is fantastic! I really enjoyed this and I'm REALLY looking forward to the second season after that awesome series finale. ETA: this review was for the entire first season although I thought the pilot episode was good as well."
5,Haven: The Complete First Season,I absolutely love this series. I wanted to recap the first season now that the third season just finished. I hope it has a long run on TV.
4,Haven,"Great show, lots of funny one liners and a very quirky cast.sort of original X-files edge to it.I really enjoyed it"
5,great series,"this series really sucks you in. Great acting, great story line, plenty twists and turns. Can't wait to see season 2."
2,"Eureka meet Heros, with way more dramatic acting","Loved Hero's, Loved Lost, Loved a lot of great serial/cinema shows. This is not one of them.......It's a mediocre try."
3,It is ok,I enjoy watching the first several shows but than it became to easy guess what was coming. I have nothing more to say.
1,Seriously?,"I am floored by the good reviews this show has gotten on here. I kept watching, hoping it would improve, but it doesn't. There is zero investment in these characters. There is no emotion and no one in this ""troubled"" town seems to care. The story lines are formulaic: someone's stress level gets too high and their ""troubled"" nature comes out, unintentionally hurting/killing other people in town. Comparisons to X-Files are laughable. This show is terrible. Everyone has different tastes of course, so you might like it, but to give you an idea of my taste in TV, I am an X-Files fan and I also enjoy Grimm, Once Upon A Time, The Mentalist and the earlier seasons of Criminal Minds."
2,Awful acting,"Don't waste your money on this, you'd be better off watching QVC.Main character is a poor actress, the entire story is too contrived."
3,Where's season 2 in complete form,"Would like to know when season 2 of the Haven, coming in DVD set, NOT INSTANT VIDEO?cAN'T DESCRIED THESE ITEM BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIT"
1,Damaged Discs,"I opened the box set for the first time today, and unfortunately, every disc is scratched and will not play. I am outside of my 30 day return, so I am unable to exchange for an undamaged box set."
1,Want my money back!,"This is a low budget cheap imitation of ""Ghost Whisperer"" with guns thrown in. The two ""leads"" are one-dimensional actors who recite lines like they are overdosed on valium. Many of the secondary characters try valiantly to save this turkey, but I think it may be a hopeless task."
4,"After The X-Files, Comes Haven","After viewing several episodes, I found that the concept of this series is very much like The X-Files without the alien and government conspiracy part--which is very good for me. Its tone is also lighter than The X-Files--which is also acceptable for me.Considering that there would not be any new episode of The X-Files again, I decide to like this series."
3,Disconcerting,"The audio and video are out of sync by a full second on at least one episode on disc #2 (that's as far as my viewing has progressed to date). It's kind of like watching a foreign film with the dialogue dubbed in BADLY. While it is not a consistent error, it is distracting and indicates to me that quality control could use some quality control.It's unfortunate because I really love the series Haven and this flaw has caused me no small degree of disappointment."
4,A good first episode.,"I learned this show is based on ""The Colorado Kid"", a Stephen King novel. This show is set in the vein of X-Files, and Fringe, where strange unexplained events take place, and are investigated by the FBI. The lead character is herself a mystery. She was an orphan, and we discover in the 1st episode Haven may have some answers to her past. As Series' first episodes go, this one was pretty good, and I'll continue watching. I give it 4 stars for a good first effort."
5,Haven is Heaven,"I am so very thrilled to have purchased this product--and at such a great price! I think I'll need to order another set as I've watched each episode so many times that I know some of the dialogue! The quality is excellent no matter which DVD player I use--regular or Blue Ray. Now, the real question--when will Season 2 be available!?"
5,This movie is so funny,"This movie is seriously funny. It's not one of those movies that you watch over and over again, but definitely a funny B-movie. My husband and I have a lot of inside jokes about this movie because it's so far out there!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Spanking the Monkey gets points for daring and can boast a sweet and winning performance by Carla Gallo, the movie's whole is not equal to the sum of its parts; it's quirky, but not especially good."
4,A Forgotten Gem,"This is a bittersweet coming-of-age movie that's more sweet than bitter. Some of the scenes are downright hilarious, thanks to some wonderful, nuanced and well-timed performances from the actors. Just the kind of comedy for viewers fed up with the formulaic stuff churned out by Hollywood's play-safe executives. Made more than a decade ago, this is truly one of those forgotten gems that deserves to be unearthed and enjoyed. A solid 4 stars."
1,disturbing barely expresses the disgust I felt while watchin,"To sum up quickly, I don't know wether it was my frame of mind or the movie itself, but I found it difficult to connect with either of the main characters or the purpose of the movie."
2,Disappointing,"Spanking the Monkey was not what I expected. In fact it was a down right horrible. There is not much else to say really, except that I wasted my hard earned money buying this film."
4,Teriffic movie.,"Spanking the Monkey is a really good movie. I was not disturbed or disgusted by it. I thought that the characters were real enough to make the story very believable. And I really felt for Raymond that he was never able to be ""alone"" when he needed it. What an interesting and truthful film."
5,My favorit book ever!,"A great book, very moving. Ms. O'Reilly's experiences are funny, yet she is able to find meaning in all of it. A life changing book for me."
3,Color faintly showed after a few washes rather.,The color seemed to show more after I washed it a couple of times. Didnt really come out as strong as I thought it would. You had to see me really catch the sunlight from the side(lol) before you would see the tint in my hair. Perhaps I overwashed right after the application before drying my hair the first time. Not really sure. So overall it was ok but dont think I will try again or at least not the same color.
2,Wins for most messy,"Pros - did not irritate my scalp or skinCons - This is the messiest, drippiest hair color I have ever used. It doesn't last very long (less than other non-permanent brands). It has a very red tone. If that is what you are looking for, you might like it, but I wanted more like the actual color honey brown."
3,"A good, quick read","This is a wonderful ""boy's life"" version of the life and times of a Marine officer who was possibly the most outspoken soldier in US history.Although basically a book for adolescents, it provides more insight into the character and personality of General Butler, than most academic studies of the man."
5,Wonder Wizard of Oz Toy!!!,"My 18 month old daughter is a huge fan of all things Wizard of Oz. I stumbled across this toy and didn't hesitate to buy it. She can spend up to 45 minutes at a time playing with it. She loves the characters, doors and music (FYI - It is NOT the music from the movie. I was disappointed too.) Overall, it is a super toy and I HIGHLY recommend it if you child likes OZ!"
3,'Sons Find Devils' soundtrack,"This is the soundtrack of the Virgin Prunes video 'Sons Find Devils'. The audio quality isn't brilliant, but it is a great CD for collectors!"
4,Great for such a young band !!,"A very good (to say the least , different) album ... rather weird stuff , but if you like that , you'll like this . An early CD , but still , a job well done ."
2,why this one?,good to have only when having also the other stuffs. or it's better not to have it at all so not to feel somethings' missing
1,could be better,good to have only if you also have the other stuffs. or it's better not to have it at all so not to feel somethings' missing
3,InCase PDA pouch,"There are numerous cases for Palm products and this one is a little more ""chic"". My Palm IIIx fits snugly inside and the pouch isn't too overburdening when attached to my belt. If you need your Palm readily available this is for you. I lost my Palm recently (it was returned) so I needed a clip-on case. However the protection factor is minimal...it's a soft case!"
2,Nice case -- lousy material,This would be a really great case except the sides are constructed from material that is EXTREMELY soft and delicate. Mine quickly wore through at the corners. Little flecks of black rubber were falling off everywhere. All In-Case had to do to make this a great case was to make the sides out of the same material that the rest of the case is made from. Very disappointing.
2,"New and Fraying Already, Also, Too Small","Just received this and it looks old. All around the edges the rubber is pealing off the flexible fabric. In addition, it is too tight, not deep or wide enough to fit my Jornada 520. No slot for stylus. Top flap barely covers the PDA to reach the velcro. Not enough protection for the PDA if dropped. The belt quick disconnect is the only good feature of this pouch. I'm using an old Nintendo game boy case and have yet to find a better hip pouch. This is the risk of buying without seeing the product first. If Amazon was local, I'd return this pouch."
1,HORRIBLE! RIPPED FIRST DAY OF USE!,"This is the most horrible item I have ever ordered from Amazon.com! The rubber around the sides of this case began to tear THE FIRST DAY I USED IT! I have a Blue Incase pouch that I bought directly from Handspring, and it was wonderful, but the ones sold here at Amazon ARE NOT the same quality, hence they are $15.00 less expensive! (...)"
2,????,This band has some talent with their instruments but the vocals are a joke. Anybody can growl like a constipated dog. What a waste of talent....
1,Be Careful,My husband took our son and his friend for a ride and the trailer tipped completly on it's side as he was coming up the driveway from the street! The kids were well with in the wieght limit and he was going slow but both children were hurt and now I'm afraid to use it. Be careful turning and going over bumps!
2,Okay but not good enough,"I picked this up at Target since it was on sale and had good reviews on Target.com and Amazon. Trailer was extremely easy to set up. Out of the box and without instructions, it took less than five seconds. Other positives: front wheel, 20"" tires, handlebar, flag, cup holders.Negatives: the seat is cheap fabric and cannot be comfortable. The helmet pockets are too high for kids under 3 and wouldn't work that well if my daughter could reach it. I wouldn't buy this if you only intend to use it for one child; the 'middle seat' isn't as good as either 'side seat'.I never mounted it to the bicycle so I cannot review this aspect. I reboxed it and took it back to the store. Bought a Burley Solo instead for double the price but the quality is so much better. No regrets.I gave two stars because it was inadequate for our needs but I think it could fit the needs of others."
4,Good resource for authors seeking publishers,"As a first time author I have used only those sections relevant to book publishers ...well organized and very informative with an index to locate publishers aligned with particular book types or genres. Also, useful information on the content and format used in writing query letters ( to pitch your book concept ) with both ""good"" and ""bad"" examples. New writers might quickly conclude that this is just the portal to a long journey. The compilation of publishers is extensive .... also included - consumer magazines and trade journals. Another nice touch, 50 literary agents were profiled along with the strong inference or my interpretation that one is best served ( if you go the agency route versus contacting publishers directly ) to determine if revenues are sourced from actual book sales or from services sold to wannabe authors. Bottom-line, great value for the money."
3,As always,"a lot of the markets are already old, but it's still a good book for finding websites that have more current coverage."
2,Save your money,"Honestly, very few of the agents in this book will even read your work. Thanks to this book, they each receive tons of submissions and can't possibly read them. If you must try it anyway, check your library first. If Writers Digest is so confident in these directories, how come they're not listed in the index? Nor is Brogan."
5,swing time,"The cat is a honest to god swinging fool. Heu is not one of those trendy bands, but the real deal. If ou like swing and jump blues then this Cd is for you."
5,A Twist At Every Corner,"As travel nurse, Karissa Carpenter, travels from hospital to hospital, so do the incidents of newborns vanishing during violent storms. Does the fact that Karissa lost her newborn to Sudden Death Syndrome have anything to do with these babies ""Stolen In The Storm?Each time that Karissa is taken in for interrogation, young Dr. Braden Marcison is there to comfort the traumatized nurse, but does he have other plans for the traumatized nurse?Things are not only busy at the hospital, but then Karissa's private life also takes a turn when her pregnant sister arrives to escape the wrath of their father who is a self-righteous, fundamentalist preacher.This book, billed as a romantic suspense, has a twist and turn around numerous hospital corners. I enjoyed every minute of it! This ending will definitely surprise you!As reviewed by Epstein LaRue, author of ""Crazy Thoughts of Passion"" and ""Love At First Type"" http://www.epsteinlarue.com/"
2,Not the best product,"I started using this product when my daughter was a newborn. At first we thought, what a great invention! It worked for a short while and then we couldn't get the light to turn on anymore. I tried to change the batteries and that didn't seem to make a difference. I thought about changing the light bulb but I don't believe it's ment to be changed. At least I didn't waist a lot of money on this item. We just use the mirror now and the overhead dome light in the van to see her at night."
1,waste of money,"I never actually attached the light because it does not turn on every time you push the button on the remote, and when it did, it was very hard to tell it was on. As for the mirror, to attach it you either use a saftey pin for cloth seats, or velcro for leather. I tied the mirror on until I could return it and get another one, because my husband was not going to stick a piece of adhesive velcro onto our leather seats. WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this to help monitor my daughter while driving. The system is very difficult to install, you need two people, one to sit and look in the mirror, and one to adjust the rear mirror. I used the remote operation and the light stayed on the whole night and wore out the batteries. This system sat in my car for a year and never once was useful for me, don't waste your money on this."
4,Peek a boo....I see you,This has really worked out for us. I didn't want to stick the light on my daughter's carseat....I thought it would get in the way (as others have said) instead I placed it behind the head rest of the back seat. It stays there and if you align your remote (which fits my car 94 Altima) it will turn on when you use the remote.As with anything else...I turn the light to the off position during the day as the batteries are bound to die out. My daughter loves it because she gets to look at herself and she loves staring at the light as it goes on and off.
2,Mirror is too small. NOT Recommend for Leather Seat.,"When we first bought it home and tried it. The remote for the light doesn't work very well. But we tried it again the next day, it seems to work alright. Mirror is way too small and it is hard to attach to the seat especially Leather seat. Considering keeping the remote light kit & buying another bigger mirror or return the whole thing and just go with the regular mirror instead."
3,mirror too small,"loved the concept, however, the mirror included in the combo kit is too small. I had no problems what so ever with the light working or getting in the way of getting the seat in the car base. When my husband decided to clean the mirror he used windex instead of plain water and scratched the surface not realizing it was not glass, so I replaced the mirror with the larger one that is sold separately and am very satisfied. Would suggest to everyone to just buy the single unit to begin with unless you do alot of driving at night, it just is not worth it."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"My husband and I bought this because I have to travel for half an hour in order to pick him up from work. Since he gets off late at night we thought the light gadget would be helpful too. Boy were we wrong not only is the mirror too small but trying to aim the remote to the sensor on the light is difficult while driving. As for being able to see him I was only abe to see him at a stop light where i would have to stretch to see the miror. Also the miror kept moving so every time I got in the car I would have to make sure I could see him, which I never could so I would wast time fixing it and then checking to see if he was in view. My husband is pretty good at reading the reviews before we buy a product, this time we didn't and boy were we sorry. Waste of Money!"
1,Don't waste your money on this product,"It took me less time to install two car seats than it did to ""try"" and install this light mirror. My baby hasn't even been born yet and it is already useless. There is a GIANT STICKER placed over the mirror that DOES NOT PEEL OFF. I tried to clean it off for about an hour and it just smudges across the mirror making it useless. I can't even see out of it. Judging by the other reviews above it definitely is NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! Get a regular mirror and use the interior light, you will be glad you did."
1,good idea in theory...,"We bought this and were very excited about it for about a week. Then we found, as other reviewers have mentioned, that the light kept falling off and getting in the way. The remote didn't work well either- it had to be lined up just right and it wouldn't hook on to our visors in our car like they say it should be able to. The light itself used up the batteries quickly as well. Then when the remote broke and stopped working all together, we ended up returning this and getting another mirror. It may have just been bad luck, but it didn't work for us."
3,It's allright....,"I registered for and received this item and I guess for the price, you at least get a good mirror out of it. The light won't stick to my car seat base, it keeps falling off, but has no problem sticking to my leather seats. The little light remote clamp doesn't fit on my visor b/c, as with most new cars, the visor is pretty thick b/c it has an extension that slides out of it to block the sun better. Each time I lock or unlock the doors with my keyless remote it turns the light on which uses up the battery. So this item hasn't been any good for me. I rated it 3 stars because the mirror is still helpful."
2,I can live without the light,There are two types of mirrors from this company: one with the light and one without. Don't waste your money on the light! It's impossible to see my DD with the light and the light keeps falling off the base of her car seat. I do love the mirror.
2,Mirror is great but not the light,We bought this item for a long drive so we could see our son at night but unless you had it lined up and close the light wouldn't come on. The remote to our cd player we had to use to turn it on. The mirror was great though because we could see more of him and he could see himself.
1,Don't Waste Your Time With This Product,"We bought this and took it home. Once we had the batteries in, we could not get it to make a connection when we closed the battery compartment. We took it back and got another only to be unable to make a connection with that one at all. The compartment seems to give to much lateral room to the batteries to make a solid connection."
2,Not worth it,This item has the right idea but the set up still needs some perfection. The light is always falling off the car seat the the mirror is way to small to see if your baby's eyes are opened or closed. The remote light is a wonderful idea but the product just needs some tweeking.
1,Silly waste of money,"Don't waste your money - just get the mirror. The mirror, I don't think I could live without. I love that I can look back at my daughter without having to turn around while driving. The light is just plain silly. You have to have it turned on for it to work, but if you leave it on all the time, the batteries die in about a day. I didn't typically remember to turn it on until after I was already driving. When I did remember to turn it on, I found the remote had to be pointed very specifically in order to turn the light on and by the time you ""uncontort"" your arm and are able to get a good look in the rearview mirror, the light had already shut off. I find it much easier to just briefly turn the dome light on in the car. Take the money you were going to spend on the light and go buy some diapers instead!"
4,Scary childhood memories,"The Tingler was the first ""Scary"" movie I ever saw! I was very young(11 or 12) when I saw it. I couldn't sleep at all that night! Although it is obviously an older movie, I still love it. Vincent Price was, as always great! I think most anyone in the ""Baby Boomer"" age would enjoy it. My grown kids even like it! Maybe I'll try it out on my grandkids!"
3,"""Do not panic but scream!! Scream for your lives!!""","THE TINGLER begins with an amusing intro by director William Castle with Castle imploring viewers to scream to control the Tingler. A brilliant concept and gimmick which suprisingly became a pretty good movie.Price plays coroner William Chapin who discovers that fear causes a parasite to grow on people's spines, which he calls ""The Tingler"". The creature, which resembles a giant lobster, can only be destroyed by its host's screams, so Price decides a deaf-mute woman who works at his local movie theater is the ideal subject to use for his experiments.This is the infamous movie in which some seats in theatres were rigged with joy buzzers (Percepto) to give viewers mild electric shocks when the ""Tingler"" was loose in the theater. One memorable sequence is partially in color. A must see for cult movie buffs and fans of Vincent Price who is his usual wonderful hammy self."
3,The Tingler,"I love the acting of Vincent Price, he is a legend. The Tingler is not one of his best. He did a fine job but the movie is just plain weird and campy."
3,Not all that I thought it would be,Vincent price is great in this movie but the movie itself stinks. House on Haunted Hill was much better. The story is ludicrous but what else can you expect from a Castle film.
2,Crazy nonsense,"I'm a Vincent Price fan, but this is one of his lesser works, in my opinion. The script and storyline are ridiculous, even for a B-picture. Still, Price's charm and superb acting save the film, as do several unintentionally funny scenes."
3,Mild Horror But Still Entertaining,"I saw this movie with my parents when I was a child. It was really scary then. Having seen it recently, I wasn't as scared but still found the movie entertaining. The special effects are what you would expect for the time period of the movie but the story line is good and the acting by Vincent Price is superb. I would recommend this movie."
3,Percepto Litigationo,"One could only imagine the flock of lawyers standing out in front of a theater showing this film. If there were shocks in the theater ...these would be nothing compared to the shock Mr.C. would recieve when the lawsuits in their "" suits"" came raining down on his office.A neat little idea to keep folks awake..and for the rest of us to ponder. The introduction is priceless and Mr. C sure is a showman. Sit back and relax....and scream if you have to..if not bring the "" Tingler"" to your local chiropracter for an adjustment.Fun all the way"
4,Can You Feel A Tingle?,"This movie is such a hoot, I loved it.Good old Vincent Price has found that with intense fear comes a creature he names the tingler and from there it's as camp and scary in every way. A true classic from the shock master, Castle"
3,A Forgotten Cinema Classic,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore. A forgotten cinema classic. Vincent Price is absolutely fantastic, somehow he manages to hold his head high even when facing adversity...like being given this movie script. The rest of the cast are woeful, the ""special effects"" are laughable, the plot (yes it has one) is totally implausible - what's not to like! It's a hoot. If you love bad cinema this one is an absolute gem."
5,A Great Old Spooky Movie,This movie scared the begeebers out of me when I was 9 ( I saw this at the movie theater on a Saturday afternoon matinee) .... just had to watch it again .... fun and suspensefull .... no wonder it gave me nightmares .... Vincent Price was the king of the genre. Glad to be able to en joy it again and again. The tape arrived promptly and in factory sealed conditiion.
4,oldie but goodie,I love the classic oldies and you cant beat Vincent Price for a smooth performance. The simplicity of the film that focuses on the motivations and not just the gore and carnage that todays movies are full of.
4,Vincent Price at his diabolical best,"Suprisingly suspensful and imaginative.Vincent Price is great as the crazed doctor,and I found the film very entertaining, especially if you are a Price fan.Rarely seen on T.V., but well worth watching."
3,I'll pass!,"I ordered these because I'm a pony-hair lover. If you purchase these shoes, order your size and not a half size up, like I did. They gapped and the fit was sloppy."
2,I Expected More From Autocourse and Alan Henry,"Disappointing effort from Autocourse and celebrated author Alan Henry. Really just a ""Picture Book"" with a very basic review of the Formula One Turbo Era.Don't understand how this falls into the Autocourse Technical Series, buy""The 1000 BHP Grand Prix Cars"" by Ian Bamsey instead if you want to read about the technical aspects of the F1 turbo era."
2,Leaves a bad taste.,"Love Lucky Jim and would also highly recommend The Old Devils and Ending up; however the main character of this novel, and the sequel, Difficulties With Girls, is such a despicable, amoral opportunist and sexual predator that I would not recommend those novels to anyone."
2,"Concept was original, but plot was amazing silly.","Beth Amos's ""Cold White Fury"" tries to be a very good supernatural thriller, as Jennifer Bolton, a widowed mother tries to protect her son Tanner, who through an accidental MRI develops supernatural abilaties. As Tanner's ""gift"" is becomes more known by the doctors, a old shadowy conspiracy(the most ridiculous part of the book) chases Jennifer, her son, and a sympathetic doctor. The silliness continues as the second rate ""Stonecutter"" wannabes plot to kill a senator and go by silly code names, and Jennifer finds that there are not one, but TWO people in her life that have been deceiving her to serve other ends. Only merits 2 stars."
4,Fear of being alone,"I never really thought about what it would be like to not trust anyone you have known for years. in the book cold white fury Beth Amos shows not only the fear of being alone, but the despair of being double crossed and used by close friends. The book also keeps you in suspense right up the very end, I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of Beth's books."
5,Scary read.,"This was the first book I read by Beth Amos, after this I went and ordered the rest! What a fantastic book, the read just swept me along, her other two books are just as good, Eyes of Night and Second Sight, all three are ones you would want to read and read again! Get this book you will not be disapointed."
5,really makes a FLUFFY bread!,"I just added a couple of tsp. to my yeast starter, excellent results! Very fluffy Bread!"
3,The bulbs I intended it to replace are larger,"The Feit [...]bulbs I intended the Sylvania bulbs to replace are larger and presumably will create more light. It's a shame neither of the bulbs' specifications tell you how large each bulb is. If I use these bulbs, along with the other bulbs, it will look weird because they are different sizes."
1,shipped unpadded and arrived broken; mercury danger?,"I'm very surprised, given that CFLs contain mercury, that this was shipped with zero padding. The thin cardboard box containing the bulb (as it would appear on a retail store's shelf) was enclosed in a folded piece of cardboard just as Amazon usually ships books. No air-filled cushion bags, peanuts, or any other padding surrounded it. It was already broken when I unpacked it. It clearly broke before it entered our home. I only hope that all the mercury had dispersed before then. Seems irresponsible to ship it this way."
3,A must for travelers but it has its shortcomings,"I wouldn'd be caught taking a trip without it, but I don't love it. For anyone over 50 the print is way too small. I have a magnifying glass in the glove compartment. The maps are way to small. If you happen to want to take non-US hyway roads, you may get lost because all the other roads are poorly identified. I have been lost many times trying to follow these maps, the most recent trying to get to Loon Lake, NY. The road is on the map but not identified. It has a name but Rand McNally doesn't seem to know it.Use it for a back up but always stop at the welcome center and get a state map. They are 5 star."
1,Accuracy,"The most important feature of a map is accuracy which makes this one virtually useless. It ""overlooks"" many Interstate exits. Roads that I use regularly ""do not exist"". Two lane highways are shown as four lane and vice versa. Cities have been obliterated. - All in all, a cheap map for people who don't need one. Better to stop at a gas station and ask directions."
5,Excellent summary of progress to date in near-field optics.,"Drs Paesler and Moyer present a comprehensive overview of the research to date in near-field optics, including their own progress in the field. Clearly written and readable passages cover both the theory and applications of near-field microscopy, as well as a primer on the discipline's history. As the field is relatively young but quickly growing, having centralized access to seminal works is a real benefit. Having one of the authors (Moyer) as a graduate advisor, I was able to take first-hand advantage of his expertise in my own near-field research; for those who don't have the luxury of one-on-one interaction with the authors, their book is the next best thing."
4,First original scifi story in a long time,"It has been a while since I've read a scifi graphic novel or book that wasn't a rip off of someone else's idea. But 'Wake' was original, fast paced and exciting. Of course since the main protagonist is a fifteen year old girl they had to block out her bared breasts. It took me a while to realize what the black line was. But the story of a girl who grew up alone on a jungle world which she was to defend from alien developers was great."
5,these guys know how to tear it up,"it is very hard to put a finger on these guys of what they play. they are very dedicated to their playing. one of the songs features a solo that sounds like they are playing a video game instead. I think it sounds like a fusion of stoner, grindcore, and metalcore. I see that they re-released their debut on Relapse. these guys have a very good career."
5,great,"I found this cd for nine bucks and decided to give it a spin. After my purchase, I was given a copy of the cd jacket with autographs the band members. Needless to say, I was pretty happy with the purchase. Excellent cd."
1,what were they thinking?,"my mom got this for my birthday and what else can i say except don't get it. it gets the job done as far as carrying your md player and discs, but who would wear this thing? it's a fanny pack. send it back to the 80's."
4,great for the gym,"I received an MD recorder as a gift so that I could record my own music to take to the gym and stop being subjected to the whims of the receptionist's musical tastes (or lack thereof). The neoprene pack is great to take to the gym. You can either wear it when moving amongst the weight equipment or hang it on a cardiovascular machine. Sure, a fanny pack would probably do the same job, but the small compartment for the player keeps it from bouncing around inside the case. The compartment stretches enough to easily hold the player and three MDs in cases. The only down side of this case is the smaller zippered compartment. The stick remote for the MD player barely fits in there and anyone who uses the headset that came with the MD player wouldn't have a place to put it. Sporty ear-buds fit in there nicely, even with the stick remote and a couple of spare batteries."
4,The Queens of Noise's swan song,"After the personnel changes that occured at the conclusion of the girls' 1977 Japan tour this record shows the Runaways at the end of their existance. Starting with ""Queens of Noise"" the band had a formula for types of songs. For example, at least one track could be considered an anthem (Queens of Noise: title track, Waitin' for the Night: Little Sister), one track showcased Lita Ford's talents on lead guitar (Queens of Noise: Johnny Guitar, Waitin' for the Night: Fantasies). The only break in this pattern is Waitin' for the Night's title track, which is the Runaways' only (albeit hard-rock) ballad. For ""And Now.. the Runaways!!"" the anthem is Saturday Night Special and Lita Ford's guitar exhibit is on I'm a Million. This album is not the best of the bands work, that goes to the Live In Japan LP, but this is a historically significant work considering the later solo successes of both Ford and Joan Jett."
5,Close to their best...,"As we Runaways fanatics wait(in vain?)for the domestic CD releases of the debut album, ""Queens Of Noise"" and(most especially)""Waitin' For The Night""(which was difficult to find on VINYL even when it first came out in Dec.'77), this is still a precious item to pick up. Joan Jett's vocals on the searching ""My Buddy And Me"" and (on Lita Ford's composition) ""Little Lost Girls"" are some of her finest moments to date, Sandy West's vocals on ""Right Now"" are charming, and the cover versions of Slade and the Beatles are excellent. Get it! Get it! Get it!"
3,Nice little phrase book,"I have enjoyed this little book, but I find that a good, comprehensive French-English dictionary (I use, among others, a Harper Collins Robert French-English College Dictionary) will have more many more idiomatic phrases in it that this book contains.Still, this is a nice, economical book that is easy to carry and use. Since I have not found many really helpful books of French idions, this was still a pleasant surprise.However, I would recommend spending the money on a really good dictionary if your funds are limited."
3,Of some use,"I'm not too sure whether there is any real advantage in this 'idioms' dictionary / guide in preference to a general, complete dictionary. Most larger dictionaries include the kind of idioms found in this guide. I would also have expected entries to include french idioms that have some circulation in english such as 'faux pas' and others."
4,Very good book on French Idioms,This book is not to be used as a French dictionary. It is a book that lists hundreds of French idioms that you may not find in a dictionary. The worse part of the book is the small print.Brandon Simpson
1,From a 13yr old that has played many horse games,First of all...If you like horse games with realistic looking horses DONT BUY THIS GAME! The horses looked pathetic compared to other horse games ive played. But I do have to say the whole mystery thing was really fun. Grooming horses did take forever though! So if you dont care about what the horses looked like than go ahead and buy it. But this game is not realistic.
4,This game is really cool!,"At first, this game was confusing. The hoof picking really confused me. The trick to hoof picking is to NOT clean in all spaces that look dirty. Only pick the right side of the hoof and try not to get the top. The mystery was hard to solve, I had to chase a crazy person on horseback five times before I could follow him without being seen and it was kind of frustrating. I got to do lots of competitions, but winning more horses meant more chores. Talking to the people was fun (except Garance). I LOVED this game and I recommend it to anyone who is patient and loves horses!"
2,Difficult......,"this game is not very fun.. but i never got very far because mine got messed up at the beginning, but your person is the slowest walker ever to be in a videogame! it took me five minutes just to walk in a circle.... This game is fun only when you are riding... nothing else....if you want a FUN FUN FUN horse game, go find another game... not this one... i love horses, and if i got further maybe i would like it...."
2,DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!! PARENTS BE WARNED!!!!!,"this game SUCKED!!!!! i luv horse games but this games sucked!!! i liked riding around but i could never get in my room! it took WAY 2 long 2 groom my horse, especialy the hooves, i still havnt finshed. u cant see anything falling when u r doing the horses hooves either. i got lets ride dreamer for x-mas and i luv!!!!!! im about 2 play it right now! i think u should get that 1. its sooooo fun!"
2,Disappointing,"Horse games are about the only thing I play, and this one is definately the worst. The movements are hard to get used to and the graphics are not very good. If you're looking for a good horse game, I definately recommend ""The Saddle Club"" PC game."
4,Pretty good,"good game, but some people are saying in their reviews that they cant pick out the hooves.What do you do in real life,class?YOU GO UP AND DOWN!!SAME IN THE GAME!!!It gets anoyying though,because if you dont take care of a horse,it gets sick.The wheel thing is hard,my friend who i loaned it to cant even get past it!!!Pretty good game,though."
5,The best horse game so far!,"WOW! I love it! Only one thing bothers me, though: There mouths don't move! Neither does the water. And you only do one hoof per horse! but it's still great, and I've only had it for one day! It's very fun and enjoyable. I haven't gotten very far, I only have 5 horses but im about to get Caramel. It's very fun, and worth the money!"
3,"Good idea, but too frustrating","I enjoyed everything about this game except for the difficulty of the game play. In order to progress through the game, you need to complete increasingly difficult courses, some in a paddock and some cross-country, within a specified time and relatively error-free. Perhaps it's easier for younger players and it's my slow adult reflexes that trip me up, but I found this close to impossible. The keyboard controls are too clumsy to allow you to move your horse around the course at a pace quick enough to beat the time; perhaps it's more workable with a joystick or other controller.Don't consider this game unless you have endless patience, lightning-quick reflexes, and a horse obsession. Otherwise you'll do what I did: scream in frustration and uninstall."
4,"Loved it, could have had some trails to ride though","Great game, fun story (though ending was abrupt). I enjoyed it a lot. It would have been nice to have trails to ride through though."
3,Fun But Has Problems,"This game is fun,but has some good and bad thingsGOOD:Horses are beautifulFun to ride in competitions(especially cross country)You get to chose your horses color(except the first one)You get to name your horses(except the first one)BAD:You have to groom your horses every 5 secondsYour character walks and talks funnyYour horse backs up wierdThe plot in the adventure is badIt takes 1 day to finish the adventureThe ending STINKS!!!!!!!!!!Over all I think you should get this game if your horse crazy."
5,Neigh!!!,"This game is a really great game, and I play it as often as I can. It can be a bit confusing when first starting out, but I soon got the hang of it. It's really fun, and there are lots of things to do in this game. It's a great game if you don't want to be riding all the time. I'm horse-crazy and I'm very focused on the quality of the graphics, and although they aren't the greatest, they're definitley better than alot of horse games. And the best part is, there's no dressage!"
1,Very Dissapointing,"I was supremely dissapointed in this game---my computer cannot play it! My video card (a very recent version of 'Intel') is apparently not compatible, despite the fact that I have played other games with DirectX. While I do think the game would be great, I strongly suggest that anyone interested in buying check the website and make sure that their video card is not one of the several types that does not work.If you are like me, and your video card will not work with the game, an excellent alternative is ""Let's Ride: The Rosemond Hill Collection"". That is also a good alternative for younger players as it is less complicated and requires less patience."
2,Revised review,"Originally my opinion of this game was very poor, however, it was due to the fact that my graphics card was not compatible with the game and made it somewhat unplayable and frustrating. Unfortunately I cannot change the star rating :\Once that problem was fixed, it was a very enjoyable game to play and the mystery was engaging, even for an adult such as myself :-) There is another Saddle Up game that is just as good to play as well."
2,More of a beginners guide,"This little book is certainly easy to use. If you know what kind of mammal you are looking at and where in North America you are, you have a good chance of identifying it. The drawings are probably more attractive to children than they are to those of us who are longer in the tooth. There are at least a couple of ommissions which makes it disappointing. The short accompanying texts are, by necessity, very limited in their scope. It might be a good starting point but very quickly makes the reader hungry for more detailed information."
4,A good treatment for those new to electrochemistry,The authors do a good job introducing the concepts of electrochemistry in a fairly readable and thorough manner. The individual chapters can be read more or less independently with minimal flipping back to earlier material for reference. The subject mater is handled at a level appropriate for an intermediate level student or for one not exceedingly familiar with electrochemistry. Exercises and problems are infrequent so this may not be a good stand alone text for an upper division class although I found the emphasis on conceptual understanding very valuable. In all a very good text.
2,Don't put much stock in the code,"The high level ideas and approaches to applications is good, but when it comes to the code techniques and practices, it poorly done. The book smacks of a professor who has become out of touch with the practical implementation of code. A good example is one of his programs that uses a switch debouncing scheme that will simply ignore a bouncy switch input and will completely miss the switch transition. Other parts of the code are inconsistent. Sometimes these inconsistencies are just poor form and some will cause the code to not run as intended.Although I did learn a couple of things from this book, I can't recommend it. I'm sure there are some better options out there."
4,Buxton Mini Bag,This is the third one I have bought. This one doesn't seem to be holding up as well as the other two. It is losing stitches and has a small cut in the top of the leather. I will probably buy another when I feel this one is too shabby.
4,it's cute,"i purchased this to match a utensil holder i purchased at another store. It holds a sufficient amount of napkins and i haven't had any issues with snagging like the other review had stated. I would have given this item five stars, but i believe it is a little over priced."
4,good for review ; handy for quick clinical reference,"The format (signs & symptoms approach) of this text should be helpful for those who need to know where to start with a case. Text is brief and to the point. The long ddx lists would be great, except that they are in alphabetical order, rather than listing by frequency of occurrence or some similar relevant quality. It is the only decent, recently published pediatric neurology text of its size that I'm aware of, so is a good choice for those needing a quick review. With improved proofreading/editing, I would rate it more highly."
3,"Comfortable Fit, Good Shoe for the Price",I am an avid runner and I was overall pleased with the fit and comfort of this shoe. I change my running shoes every three months and this was fairly good quality for the price.
5,Syrup Flavoring,Execellent for making sodas and flavoring ice cream. Shelf life is over a year before opening and lasted at least a year in the refrigerator after opening. I buy several bottles of different flavors with each order.
2,faded glory,"The Chicago dictionary and I have been together ever since its third edition, which was the best of its day. The fourth edition set a standard that I have not seen equalled. The fifth edition is a great disappointment, a wastrel son that has squandered the intellectual capital bequeathed him by his forebears.Gone are all the fine distinctions that make a language not simply intelligible but meaningful. Gone are the phonology and history of the language that gave structure to our understanding. Gone are the regional precisions that, in this day of continent-wide cable TV emanating from Buenos Aires, Caracas, Mexico City, Miami, and Los Angeles, become ever more important.On the bright side, the fifth edition's typography, while cramped, is easier to read.But I can recommend the Chicago no longer. The fifth is decidedly for the short-attention-span crowd. If you don't want a dictionary written for elementary students, either get the fourth edition or look to a different publisher."
4,Good for students,"I'm an intermediate Spanish student, and purchased this dictionary for that reason. I read a lot of reviews and changed my opinion many times before I finally settled on this one. I really don't know how good the other ones are, but this one is great. I'm not at all sorry I made this choice. It has a lot of useage examples for most of the words, often using them in phrases that provide exactly what I'm looking for. The front has rules for grammar, pronunciation, and an extensive list of verbs in their various conjugations. I highly recommend this one."
4,It's a decent dictionary,"I bought this dictionary because my teacher recommended it. I like it, it's pretty decent and it has some extra features I wasn't expecting. There's a bit of a spine break in the middle of the dictionary but I wasn't expecting a new dictionary in the first place."
2,Simply wrong,"The author cannot hide his bias towards static typing, and fails to appreciate the power of a dynamic language such as Python. The Python case study (Section 16.3, p. 425) has this criticism:""""""The compiler will not reject code that might fail with a type error, nor even code that will certainly fail, such as:def fail(x):... print x+1, x[0]""""""In fact it is trivial to implement a class X to create an instance x that can be added to an integer and accessed as a sequence, thanks to basic operator overloading. In order to comment on the design of a language, it is prudent to have more than passing knowledge of its semantics."
1,Product not as advertised,Book was missing about 60 pages. xxx xxxxx xxx xxx xxxx xxxx xx x xxx xxx x x xx x.
5,Great Specialty Tool,This tool is well made and works as described. I couldn't have done my restoration project on my 64 vette without this tool to remove the door handles and lock mechanism.
1,To Be Honest: a Waste of Money !!,"I sincerely doubt how honest some of the reviews of this book here are! It's simply not a good guide. Not that the author can't write, but the content is very poor. A search on the internet will reveal more information on the places you want to visit than you can find in this book. There are so many terrific places which aren't mentioned: in fact some of the most interesting synagogues France has to offer aren't included. Probably the author doesn't know them, which says a lot about the research she has done. A great subject to write a book about but unfortunately a missed opportunity!"
2,Incomplete Guide,I was very disappointed in this book. It had very few historical details or picturesand seemed to have little information other than listing some kosher restaurants and synagogues. I bought this book to find the town in Provence with the 4th century synagogues & ruins visited by my late parents in the 1980s. This book does not mention such a place.
2,Ce n'est pas bon,Je suis un ecrivain et je n'aime pas ce livre. J'ai vivé a Paris y le livrene m'aide pas trouver les places juifs dans ma belle cité. L'histoire de lesjuives francaises es magnifique -- il y'a des autres livres superiors.Au revoir et mazel tov!
5,Awesome,These guys are great.... they can sing and harmonize beautifully. Becoming my favorite group.
3,Pretty But Plastic and Small,"I wanted to jazz up my husband's walker after his hip surgery. I though these beads might fit on a walker basket but they don't. The slot just fits thin bicycle spokes. I put the beads on cord and tied them to his walker. It's not quite as cool as having the beads on the basket spokes but does the job. The beads are colorful enough to show up, however, they are very very small and it takes a lot of them to look good."
1,I loved Grey Flannel....but this isn't it,"I loved smelling this on my husband; so I thought I'd purchase it for Christmas. Well, maybe I got a bad batch, but it came to me today smelling like vinegar and not anything remotely good. The Amazon rep said perhaps I should keep it in my glovebox to throw at any potential attackers it's THAT BAD.Of course, I could've just received a bad batch, but I won't order through Amazon again. Perhaps it's just old stock, where the ingredients just changed their composition (or decomposition?). I'll head to the department store, where at least I can smell it before I buy it!"
1,SPRAY ON COLOGNE,The spray top on the bottle of cologne does not work--won't even go up and down--cannot pump it & the cap will not come off--at least easily..soI have been using the after shave & that is fine.....exactly the smell Iremembered from yrs ago.
5,The Best Ever,I've been using this cologne since I was about 13 years old. I love it! I think it's the best out there. I just love to smell it.
1,Electronic water softener,This product does not work. We installed it according to instructions and used it for about a month. It made absolutely no difference in water quality. The dishes come out of the dishwasher covered with a white gritty film. The product is being returned. We are going to buy and use a regular salt water softener.
1,Service is terrible,This product died after 6 months. I sent email last week; no one replied. I called the service phone; no one answered the phone and the mailbox was full. Stay away from this company
2,Incomplete information,When I bought the product the name of the product and infofmation provided would indicate the this product was a replacement for a salt based water conditioner.NOT TRUE.the information provided with the unit state that it dose not remove rust and that you need to buy a $300.00 product for this purpose.What good is it if it can not get rid of the most common hardner in the water?
3,After 3 months I think it is definitely helping,It defiantly seems to help with lime scale build up but it really doesn't soften the water at all. So yes it will help remove scale but you still need a water softener if you want your shampoo to lather.
3,The jury is still out,If it has an effect it appears to be pretty minor so far. I have had it hooked up for around 3 months and I am not sure I am seeing to much in the way of less lime scale. I will give it a few more months and we will see
3,Still hoping ...,"Well, I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have not noticed any changes. I am still hopeful that it is at least helping to keep build-up from forming so fast, but all the big claims have not taken place yet. It does seem that soap and sahving cream seem to lather a bit better, but that may be due to me thining it might.I will update things if anything changes!Tony"
1,ClearWave JUNK!!!,"Clear wave did not work in my home in Tampa, Florida...We Had the unit installed for 5 months and made my scale and lime build up MORE...Our water hardness is 9%-15% and this did nothing but make bubbles..I wish i could get my $170 BACK what a scam...Save your money and buy a WATERBOSS @ HOME DEPOT...Good Luck"
1,Scam,"From what we know about physics and chemistry there is no way that this product can actually accomplish anything.There have been many fly-by-night companies that sell so called 'electronic water softeners', descalers, and so forth that have popped up and vanished over the years.If this process did work, there would be major appliance companies that would be making and marketing them.Do not buy."
5,Clearwave is Great!,"So far, this product is wonderful. Very easy to install & I am hoping to see remarkable results very soon! I got a great deal & saved gas by not having to go out to a store! Very satisfied as usual."
4,Clearwave,"Works well as far as dissolving salt is concerned.It really makes your skin feel soft after couple of days.Little expensive for what it does, but best thing you can buy."
3,Clearwave Water Softener,"It was easy to install and not too costly. I did notice a little more lather when I shower, but nothing drastic."
3,Still evaluating its effectiveness for softening water,"I bought about 8 weeks ago to substitute for my broken water softener. Water treated by Clearwave water softener appears to be ok for washing clothes and for bathing. However, recently, I have been noticing white film on the ceramic dishes that are washed in the dishwasher. I am hoping eventually it would get better.As for installation, it is extremely simple."
1,This does not work,"We've had the Clearwave installed for over 6 months now and haven't noticed any difference. We still get build-up in our dishwasher, in our humidifiers, and on all our faucets and shower heads (causing them to leak)."
1,No change at all,"I wouldnt say this is completely useless. You could use this as Expensive Christmas lights. Its been 8 months since I fitted this at my home, but still see scaling in my bathroom and in dishwasher. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone."
1,Doesn't Work,"I was skeptical ... but based on the 50/50 reviews, decided to give it a try. Installed as instructed and it's been about 3-4 months now that I've had it installed plugged in and waiting. When you turn on the faucet now, you can see a momentary flush of something, don't know if that is all it does or not. My true test was to wash the car with it and see if it works. Supposedly washing the car with soft water leave the windows spot free when drying.Washed the car with it... windows still spotted up."
1,Didn't work for me,I have been using this product for three months now and can see no difference in my water. No scale has been removed. IN all fairness to the manufacturer they do not claim that it works for all hard water. Mine may just be too hard.
3,Does it work... not sure,"I have had one of these for about 6 months. When I first installed it, i noticed that the water felt immediately softer and seemed to bead better, but maybe it was just in my head. After using it for 6 months, I think I can say that my skin is a bit less scratchy, but it doesn't do anything for my hard water deposits. When you think about it, it makes sense since the minerals are still in the water. They've gotta go somewhere when they dry on surfaces...So is it worth it. Maybe... If you really don't want to pay for a real water conditioner."
5,A Must Have for Tankless Hot Water Heaters,"I purchased the Clearwave in November of 2010 with some scepticism. To my delight the product works as advertised! The reason for my purchase was that I was having to service my newly installed tank-less hot water heater due to deposit build up on the flow sensors all too often. The Clearwave really does help with mineral deposits and is a must have for owners of tank-less hot water heaters. We noticed a difference in our water and after replacing the spout on the shower (because the shower valve was all built up with deposits) there were no more mineral deposits on the spout. It really does soften existing deposits as well, as I discovered when flushing my tank-less hot water heater. I have just ordered the newer model of the Clearwave for the house we just moved into as the water is horrible here in Mount Joy, PA."
1,It doesn't work,I had a water softener and wanted to replace it the this water conditioner. I put the softener in bypass mode and installed this conditioner. In less than a week I clearly see water spot everywhere.
4,Excellent value,"We have extremely hard water where we are, but this product has certainly made a difference. I was a little skeptical of this product specifically as it was much cheaper than the ones I've priced before (usually $500 or so). This product does do what it describes, it reduces the hardness of your water. We now see very little spotting and much less soap scum.I would not say that our water is completely soft now as compared to some soft water areas I have visited, but we do now get lather on soap where we didn't get any before, we get just about no water spots at all, and almost no lime build up in appliances like tea kettles and coffee pots etc.Very affordable, well worth the $$."
5,I love Clearwave!,I installed Clearwave in about 20 minutes and noticed it working w/in days. I love it and am SO happy I tried it before I spent money on a water softener plus salt. I'm recommending it to all my friends!
2,very general info,"The book had a few helpful ideas or approaches to opening a practice, but nothing that you have not already heard. Overall, good info, but very basic."
3,"Great Size, Where to attach it?","I received this as I gift off of my registry but seem to have trouble figuring out how to attach it. I drive a SUV which has no head rest in the middle back seat. If you pin the mirror to the seat it is lower than the car seat so I cannot see in the mirror from my rear-view mirror? It would be great for a head rest, but who has one in the middle back seat of an SUV? I have tried to hang it from the head rest on either side, but there's no way to really get it positioned right and angled right to see the baby? I've had the same problem in my husband's extended cab truck. If it had a big clip or something on the back that clipped on the top of the seat it might work. Great sized mirror though."
2,Can't see a thing,I put this mirror on my registry. When I first put it in my car I was very pleased with the size of the mirror. I had to put the car seat near the door because i was unable to attach the mirror in the middle. I am unable to use the mirror because it fogged up when left in the car during the hot weather.
5,Can't live without it!,"I bought this mirror when our daughter was a few weeks old and I don't see how I lived without it when I had my first two boys. It is great! I had a little trouble getting the mirror to attach correctly but once I got it to stay, it is a lifesaver! It is worth every penny!"
5,Excellent product!,"I even bought some for my friends! Peace of mind when baby is making noises. You can see exactly what's going on. Great size! And she can see me too so we can talk and interact! I have an SUV and it fits great. I'd like to see a better pattern on the material. Blue plaid is not really my style, but I'll sacrifice since this is such a great product. Love it!"
2,New Mom,"I got this thinking it would be great. I thought I would be able to keep an eye on my baby and not be a road hazzard. I kept it for a week or so then took it back. I was not able to get the mirror to sit right in my car. I have a mid-size sedan and there was no headreast to attach it to. I had to use the LATCH system andit didn't get the job done. I was really disappointed because I really wanted it to work. After thinking about it I figure if there is something that wrong with my baby I will know it without the mirror. By having the mirror I will only be staring in it concerned about my baby and not watching the road therefore actually becoming a road hazzard because I have the mirror. I love the idea, but it is not for me."
2,Doesn't fit in my Acura,"I wanted to be able to see my baby who's car seat is in the middle position of the back seat as prescribed by the manufacturer and this mirror seemed like the best one i've seen. Unfortunately it doesn't fit in my 99 Acura TL so i've sort of temporarily tied it in for now, which allows the mirror to flop around and that doesn't seem too safe. I'll probably return it if i can't figure out a better way to install the mirror safely."
3,Just OK,"I really did love this mirror - it was just a little confusing on how to attach it to the car. It would really work great if you have the head rests in the back seat - but if not you will have to pin it to the back of the seat - and after you remove it, it leaves little holes where the pin was. Also - if your child is in an enfant car seat the mirror has to be pretty low down to see him/her and you will have to move your rear-view mirror down to see him/her every time which is rather inconvenient. Once my son moved to a bigger rear facing car seat it worked a little better. I would look for other options before choosing this one - I am sure there are better out there!"
3,Beware of Cleaning!!!!!,"When we first purchased and installed this mirror, it was a God-send! We felt so much better being able to see our son without pulling over or, worse, wrecking the car. The mirror was easy to install in our Jeep Grand Cherokee and we liked that there were no extra lights, sounds or cartoon characters.NOW...after a few sneezes in the carseat, the mirror was covered with spots. We tried to clean it, but the whole surface just smeared! Now the mirror is useless and I'm not very happy at all about having to replace it.Just be careful.....Don't clean it if it's not absolutely necessary, and then be ready for permanent smears."
4,Gotta have it!,This is one of the best products! We have an SUV and this mirror fits nicely on the back seat headrest. I can not imagine driving around without this mirror. It allows us to watch the baby while he is facing the back of the car. The only down side to this mirror is that it did not work well in our other car (Saturn) and so we are buying one with a suction cup for that car. This mirror is a really good size which makes it very easy to see your baby. The baby can also look into the mirror and see himself for a bit of entertainment.
3,OK Product,This is OK.. Its really hard to position and in a smaller car isnt really worth it. I would return it but I already threw away the thing it came in... It's good in a SUV or something like that so I use it in my mom's Blazer and it works good...
3,Not quite good enough,"I wish this mirror had a companion that would fit underneath my rearview mirror. It's dangerous to turn around while driving, and it would be much more useful if I could simply glance up to see my child. Also, I drive a large SUV, and the straps do not correspond with the seat headrests. I have to drape one strap and let the other hand. I'll be looking for a different system soon. The mirror is big enough, and I am able to see my daughter clearly, however."
4,Safety must!,"This has been a wonderful safety device in the car. It was somewhat difficult to get up, but worth the time it took. My son turned blue in the backseat when he was 5 days old. Had I not been in the backseat with him, he probably would have died. I went and bought this the day he got out of the hospital."
3,Durable?,"I was not impressed with this product. Perhaps I am rough on things, but I saw a smudge on the mirror and tried to wipe it off and ended up just scratching the surface more. I have tried another mirror since and am much happier with its scratch-resistent surface."
4,"Good mirror, but view can be distracting","I got this mirror when my daughter was born for my SUV. It allows me to see what she is doing in her rear facing car seat, but the view can be distracting as oncoming traffic can also be seen in its' reflection. Attaching it to the seat was a bit confusing, until I slid it over the top of the headrest instead of trying to loop it through the hole in the middle. Overall, I liked this mirror better than another one that I was given as a baby shower present (it was too small) and haven't had any complaints."
3,Does the job but needs help staying put!,"After buying and returning no fewer than 4 different mirrors for our car, this one finally made the cut. It is wide enough to see the entire car seat and baby, and fits perfectly on the headrest. The problem is, it won't stay in place no matter how tightly you adjust the straps. We wound up having to put two jumbo baby diaper pins into the headrest and secure the straps that way. If you have leather interior, this won't be a very appealing option. We're expecting baby #2 soon and will purchase one more of these since they do work well, so just make sure you get those pins to go along with it!"
1,Not Stationary -- Poor Fit,My small sedan does not have headrests in the backseat so there's no place to anchor the mirror. I've wedged it into the armrest compartment but the mirror wobbles when I drive so I don't always have a great view of the baby. This was a complete waste of money for me. My husband has an SUV and it does secure nicely into the headrest is his car.
1,DON'T buy if you have leather seats!,This item is basically useless if you have leather seats unless you want to ruin them and pin the mirror into the leather. I also tried attaching the mirror to the seat belt but it does not reflect high enough. This is a waste of money for me. I think it would work if you have headrests in your back seat (I know some cars do).
2,Install with a safety pin??!,"Absolutely the dumbest design... First of all, how many cars have headrests in the center of the back seat? That leaves the other option - use the SAFETY PIN to poke the strap through your upholstery. I don't know about you, but I would not want to damage my cloth upholstery by stabbing anything through it, let alone leather! It is absolutley useless to us. My search continues for a product that will work for us..."
2,Baby shadow in sight,"When this mirror was new, it was great! As time goes on, the mirror becomes hazy and you can only see the baby's head shape and shadow."
2,Didn't stay in place,"I bought this mirror because it was so much larger than the others on the market. It didn't do me much good, since the darn thing kept falling off the headrest. I tried installing it with both the velcro straps and the safety pin and it wasn't any better. It would stay in place sometimes, but not at the right angle for me to see the baby. I have since purchased a different type which is WONDERFUL!!!"
1,dangerous,"Take it from an experienced Mom of 11 years. Looking at your baby while at a stoplight is one thing, but it's just too tempting to look back there at every little girgle or squeal. I have to wonder how many rear-end accidents were caused by these mirrors vs. how many babies were saved from choking on their Cheerios. Your baby would be much safer if you got over your paranoia and kept your eyes on the road!"
2,Unsafe per California Highway Patrol,"The California Highway Patrol, when installing my rear-facing infant seat, noticed the mirror I had over the back seat and said that it was unsafe for two reasons: (1) it becomes a projectile into the baby during an accident; (2) the driver is distracted by looking at the mirror rather than the road, making an accident more likely. So the officer recommended against using the mirror."
3,Not Good if Baby Sits in Middle,It was recommended to put my infant seat in the middle which doesn't work with the mirror (at least with a sport utility vehicle). Now my baby is over 20 lbs. and I moved him to the side so I can use my mirror.
1,Not for hot climates,I was really disappointed in this mirror. I'm surprised at the quality of the plastic (clearly it couldnt be glass due to safety factors) considering it is meant to be used in the car. After the first day in the car the reflective surface was totally distorted and blurred. I would have returned it if I lived in the US..Apparently not made to withstand summer heat..Im now looking for a new oneDeborah
3,Difficult to Install,"My sister and brother in law purchased this mirror for my new niece (Charli), but have had an extremely difficult time installing the mirror securely. She owns a Toyota Camry with no head rest in the middle and we cannot afix the mirror no matter what we all attempted. After reading several other reviews, I might have discovered alternatives to get the product to work correctly. In the meantime, I purchased another (cheaper) brand mirror which attaches to the rear window and can be adjusted with little or no effort. My sister is thrilled to finally be able to take her precious cargo on road trips for the first time without constantly worrying whether Charli is safe and doing well in the back. They liked the large size of your mirror, but would not have purchased this item if they had realized the difficulty with installation. Perhaps a re-design might be in order for car usage. Thanks."
3,Not great for SUVs,"I have an Isuzu Rodeo and this mirror has to go on the rear passenger side head rest at an angle for me to see the baby. There is no middle head rest in my truck and when put on the seat in the middle it's too low. I have rigged it so I can see her, but occasionally have to reset it because it moves. Not great for a SUV."
3,Needs constant adjustment,"First, the clip on mine doesn't hold and keeps coming unclipped. Then I got a new car that doesn't have a headrest in the middle so there is nothing to attach it to. The little velcro doesn't hold it and it keeps falling on the baby. I like the size of this one and once I get it adjusted, I can see her fine. It just doesn't stay put for very long. One bump and it comes crashing down. I am looking for something else."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have 2 of these mirrors, one in the plaid pattern and one in the brown leather/suede. How 2 of the exact same mirrors can be so different is beyond me. While the leather one is great (so far), the plaid one has fogged up and cannot be wiped clean, making it almost impossible to see my daughter. The sticky tab that can be used when not mounting it on a headrest held for about 10 minutes and then continually fell forward. When I finally moved it to a headrest, I was tightening the strap and it snapped right in 2 making the entire mirror impossible to use at all! It's a needed accessory but this one disappointed me."
4,Safety Experts say NO,"I love this mirror but while having my infant & convertible car seat(s) checked I was told by 2 different people that these mirrors aren't a good idea. They said they are potential missiles in the event of a crash. They were absolutely against adding anything to the car seat. (seat mats, strap pads, head rolls that aren't included, etc.) When my daughter was younger it was great because I could check to see if her head was in the correct position but now that she can hold it up better I think I'm going to remove it. I'll miss seeing her sweet face though... she's still rear facing."
3,Not good for suvs,"We have a Jeep Cherokee and bought this mirror because it says good for suvs. Wrong! I ended up having to use safety pins to attach it to the back seat so that we can see our daughter. Once I got it attached with the pins it does it's job, but it does have scratches that make seeing her a little difficult. All in all, I think it is more expensive than what it is worth."
3,Mystery Book,This was one of Gwendoline Butler's book that I did not have. I enjoyed reading the book. The book was in satisfactory condition although the pages were yellowed.
5,Excellent product.,"Quite simply a wonderful flax seed oil. One is often drawn to the product with the most reviews, but I have known the reputation of Spectrum products and for me a filtered oil I use for my daily needs was very important when deciding on a brand due to my auto-immune condition. I like the proportion of Omega-3s in this product. Flax seed oil is best used within two months of opening and I always keep it refrigerated. I have purchased smaller containers in the past from Whole Foods - this seemed like a frugal option. Very happy with the product which was sent with protection from the heat and it arrived promptly because of storage requirements."
2,Fishy taste!,I purchased this flax oil product and it has a fishy taste! What gives? The irony is that one of my main purposes in trying it is that I hate the taste of fish oils.
5,Flax Oil - Organic Ultra Enriched with Lignans by Spectrum Essentials 24 oz,It is an excellent product.
4,"If you like BB King's style, you will like this!","Guitar licks and trumpets that get your feet going, your head bobbing"
1,No good,"Dont buy the picture is the old model theres a totally new model, now it sucks i cant use it."
2,Stanley does not back this product up,"I am a general contractor in California and use the heck out of my tape measures. I purchased the Stanley FatMax xtreme 25' tape measure with the thought that paying extra for a beefy tape would allow for years of use. As others have noted the tape requires way too much force to lock it in place. This is irritating but tolerable. I take pretty good care of my tools and the actual tape looks pretty nice still. All the lines are still viewable. However, after retracting the blade fast one time it cracked at about the 3' mark. Now it may or may not want to go in and out. Stanley does not warrant this according to the pictures of ""abuse"" on their website. I let it go in fast but not that fast. Anyway I am going to buy the cheapy tapes from the big box stores. They allow you to walk in and exchange them, no questions asked. We'll see how that works out. Stanley, make a ""true pro"" version, back it up and I'd pay extra for it."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I have used the old FatMax for years. Best tape out there. This Xtreme is new but definitely not improved. The first 6 inches of the tape has small numbers on both sides with the ""Blade Armor"" logo running right through the middle, very confusing and hard to read. Also the chrome & black color makes it hard to find in your bags or tool box. I don't know if a different plastic was used but I already have a crack in my case. The old yellow model is much more visible. I have reverted back to my 4 year old FatMax original and given the Xtreme to my crew as a spare, they don't like it either. Looks really cool, a lot of razzle dazzle WOW!!"
2,Design flaw (spring too weak),"Here's the deal with the thing. Is works great and when finding the center of a ceiling for example it's A-#1 BUT the spring may ware out. I got it less than 2 months ago and now it won't go all the way back in on it`s own (it stays out a foot or so). It's not because it's dirty, it's not because I've loosened the spring, it's not because the blade is bent, it's because the spring has worn out. This is why it happens (I think), the flat max extreme is so curved it acts like a spring it's self when rolled up (much more so than the regular flat max) and the spring they put in there is just not thick enough to fight that and keep it's memory over time. I tried tightening the spring, it didn't help much and now it won't go all the way out...I don't know about all of them, but the one I had was fully extended from time to time and the spring wore out. Use caution and talks to others before taking my word for it..."
2,It only looks like a good tool,"I thought this was a pretty good tape for a month or so- good stand-out length, seemed heavy-duty. Then the blade just snapped off- not doing anything with it except extending it out. No prior kinking or abuse. My take is that in order to make the blade stand out so well, they used a stiff brittle steel that doesn't roll up well and develops stress cracks until it snaps off. My cheaper tapes have universally lasted longer than this expensive one- also, no replacement tape to be had- nothing to do but throw the whole thing away when it breaks. I remember when you could actually fix these things, but those days are gone."
1,not happy,"I ordered the ""old"" fat max tape and got the new style which is completely ridiculous due to the end being gigantic. False advertising at its best."
2,Not what I was looking for.,The measuring tape in the picture is what I wanted and what I received in the mail is not what is in the picture. I have been looking for this particular measuring tape for a while and found it on this site finally. Well what I got was not what was in the picture on the webpage. Instead I got something different which I had seen a local store for a cheaper price!Oh well I guess I am stuck with it. Not cool!
5,SPECTACULAR !! You will not be disappointed !,"If you are a birder or a photographer, Tom Vezo's photographs will make you say ""WOW!"". The images have great lighting, are artistically pleasing, are very close-up, and are extremely sharp, while the text is succinct and highly informative. If you buy this book, you will NOT be disappointed!"
3,Some Good Funk and One Classic Track,"""Midnight Magic"" has enough Commodores funk and soul to compensate for the sappiness of ""Still"" - a number-one ballad that set the stage for Lionel Richie's solo career. The 1979 release is highlighted by the classic ""Sail On,"" which can be heard in its original five-minute version (most greatest-hits packages feature the edited Top 10 single). Other gems include the R&B hit ""Wonderland"" and the hard-driving ""Sexy Lady."" Though no longer in print, ""Midnight Magic"" was the last Commodores album that really mattered."
1,WARNING: Not The Original Album!!!,"I received this one today and based on what I got, if you get this CD fully expecting the authentic ""Midnight Magic"" album you're in for a disappointment. Although having all the originally listed songs, the edited (that's right, edited) cuts on this CD are the same length as the ones on the CD that has the albums ""Midnight Magic"" and ""Natural High"" together on one disc (of which is an edited version of the original). I don't know for sure but I suspect that this CD has been copied from the latter.So, if you don't mind edits then this is for you but if, like me, you want your beloved old-school music in its original full length format... well, you've been warned."
5,One of the best Socket A motherboards!,"While it makes more sense today to build a new computer using 64-bit motherboards, if you need a replacement Socket A board the AN7 is one of the best. However, it's no longer manufactured so it's hit or miss finding one today. I recently bought one like new through an Amazon reseller and found it is an impressive motherboard.Paired with an XP mobile CPU I already had this board overclocks with ease to 2.4GHz and higher. Its nForce2 chipset is very flexible allowing almost any manual adjustment you need to overclock a CPU. I use it as a home theater PC but now use it for much more because it's so fast. I sure don't see any need to replace it for quite some time. An excellent purchase!The features described above are all most people will need."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Having read hundreds of Vietnam era books, and served 3 tours there, this is one of the most disappointing efforts to make it into print. Some decent details of the Spectre mission were offset by very poor writing and a 6th grade level story. It's not often that I'm sorry to have spent money on a book...but this time I was."
5,"The Fence - A ""Must"" Read","Enjoyed Mr. Morales' ""The Fence"" very much. He made you feel like you were right there and the transition from war to camp to home was seamless."
5,Whole Grain,The whole wheat was good but takes some getting use to.A lot more filling than regular pancakes.
4,Euro-bag,I bought this bag in pink for myself and this green one for my sister to travel through 9 countries in Europe for 5 weeks. It fits soooo much! Loads of pockets and space. I'd highly recommend.
4,Not perfect for the PSP 3000,"What I was really after was a stand for my shiny new PSP 3000. Most of the cases that double as a stand are too bulky for me to carry around on a daily basis, so this product fit the bill. The fact that it doubles as a source of extra power is even better.Be aware that it is not designed for the PSP 3000 (nor the 2000 which has the same form factor I believe). The item has clips which are supposed to fit into the screw holes on either side of the USB connector on the top of the PSP.However the 3000 is too narrow and the clips do not engage. The stand does work for me though because of the silicone skin I've wrapped my PSP in. It adds a bit of thickness and gives the clips something to grab onto. Without the skin, the PSP 3000 could fall out of the stand.Also note that while in the stand, the PSP is held high enough to allow the use of a typical headphone plug."
5,One of the best study Bibles.,"I bought my first Ryrie Study Bible, New American Standard version, in 1979. I took it through Bible college, seminary, and have used it for reading and for my Biblical studies until now, it is worn and tattered.During the last 26 years I have bought many other study Bibles but I keep coming back to Ryrie.So I just bought the Ryrie Study Bible/New American Standard/Red Letter Indexed Bonded Black Leather. This is the expanded edition which has more notes, better footnotes, updated maps and many other useful tools for your study.I look forward to using this Bible for another 25 years.God Bless"
1,Pricing is out of whack.,You can buy a case of 24 on this same exact site for a dollar less than a 6 pack....and the 6 pack price on Amazon is twice what you would pay for it in a grocery store.Pay attention folks.
2,Not for me,"Many people have talked about how great these were but they weren't my cup of tea. They are very tart. I think that the quality is great, they are just not for me. No problems with shipping."
3,Please check for availability locally.,"We bought these thinking that they were not in stock in any of the stores surrounding us. While under the impression that we would have to drive an hour just to find them, we caved in and bought these. Not but six hours later I was browsing the local Kroger when lo and behold... I spotted a lone six-pack of Limonata sitting on the shelf of the water aisle. For one fifth of the price I paid here."
4,Cute!,"Absolutely adorable, the new mother loved it. Didn't give 5 stars because I gave it as a gift and don't know how durable it is."
5,The perfect size for 2,"This is a perfect size little gem to feed 2 people. Sometimes the pots get too big, but this is perfect!"
2,Hand crank battery power failed,"I'm wondering if anyone else has really tested the hand crank power on this radio. I let the rechargeable battery run down completely (not intentionally, but a good test for emergency preparedness), and I found that after cranking for a full 90 seconds, the radio only worked for a couple minutes. I was very disappointed and returned it, since I felt that in an emergency, this would be more frustrating than helpful."
4,Easy to use,"We bought this for a trip out of state so my husband could enjoy a shortwave radio while we were away from home as well as some emergency/weather info, if needed. He has been using it to get familiar with it at home and has found it to be easy to use. Only drawback was no adapter came with the unit and finding one to fit has been difficult at several stores. That would save on the batteries when using at home. Otherwise it is a good buy, small and convenient for carrying."
5,an excellent introduction to Catholicism,"This is a wonderful and compelling introduction to Catholicism. In that sense it does not exactly begin a new literary style. However, it has the interest of presenting the theme in a very contemporary and clear language. The book can be interesting to the agnostic looking for a clear, short enough and understandable book about the issue. It can also be useful to catholics looking for new ways to present the Faith."
3,"Boring, Preachy, Evasive","I can't even finish this book it's so boring. It reads similarly to a Bible, evades the issues and was a waste of money. If you want Real answers about the C. Church, find another book. One written by an intellectual."
1,Curiasities,"Despite the subtitle, ""Ten Controversies Explored"", this book offers no explorations. In dealing with such difficult issues as women's right to be ordained as priests, Catholic sexual ethics, Catholicism vs. democracy, and more, Mr. Weigel simply summarizes the viewpoints of curia Catholicism. The book contains no historical background information. Mr. Weigel's main references in the book are Pope John Paul II, Prefect of The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) Josef Ratzinger, and Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar. Don't let the title of this book fool you. This is NOT a book about ""The Truth of Catholicism"". Most of all this is a catalogue of reactionary Catholic opinions."
1,Cool book - but very hard,This book seemed cool but we haven't been able to make anything because the directions aren't clear and concise. Very frustrating.
3,not for beginners,"My nine year old son got this for Christmas. It's quite difficult fold some of the models in it. I think the instructions could have been much clearer. Perhaps a better idea of how large to make some of the folds? Furthermore, my son was quite disappointed that the planes we could fold didn't fly. Maybe the title should have included the word ""model"" EG ""Paper Aiplane Models with Dollar Bills"" Perhaps people with lots of origami experience would do well with this book, but for us novices and nine year olds it will hold the shelf down nicely and see little wear."
4,Great Unique Gift,Book shipped quickly and as advertised. Purchased as a gift for former Tomcat fighter pilot. He loved it!
2,Garage Door Monitor,I gave up on this monitor. The transmitting range is not as claimed in my opinoon. I set this up in my bedroom which is about 40ft fron the garage door and it does not work
3,Garage door monitor,"It works, but for my use, the range (they claim 300 ft.) is not as advertised. My monitor is three rooms (appx 45') away with a brick wall separating the garage from the house and I can't use it because the monitor will not shut off when the door is down. It works if I move the monitor to the room closest to the transmitter, but I seldom use that room so I cannot use it."
1,Junk,"This garage door alarm works, but wont shut off when the door is closed . Tech support wont answer your calls for help. Update, tech support did return my phone call and told me I could send the unit in to them for repair at my exspence. Thanks but no Thanks SKY LINE. Do Not buy this defective product. Buyer BEWARE. Amazon did replace it once but the second one does the same thing."
4,"classic sci-fi, have fun","I can't find anything negative to say about this book. Its not the deepest book, nor does it have as much detail as many Sci-Fi books, but still... it was really damn entertaining. The premise is fun. If you are in the mood for a light, entertaining book that will make a good movie in your head, read this book."
4,A Romping Good Read,"I love sci-fi and fantasy and a rollicking good read with characters with whom I can identify and sympathize. It is simply written and yet has depth and purpose in its telling. The characters are fun (the good and bad guys clearly identified), just complex enough to be interesting, but not too complex not to be remembered from chapter to chapter if there has been a couple of days between reads. It does not take an genius IQ to follow the story but it is a good story about family, friendship and love that is satisfying all the same. This reading for fun and entertainment; a good read for teens as well as adults."
5,Kage Baker: Master Storyteller,"Like EVERYTHING Kage Baker writes, 'The Empress of Mars' is involving, funny, a joy to read, and is filled with characters you care about. The PC- to-the-nth-degree Earth she populates so flawlessly is fascinating and too-horribly possible. Her Mars is dusty red and dry, old and new at the same time. I've been hooked on her work since 'In The Garden of Iden'."
3,Entertaining fluff,"I like Kage Baker's books a lot and have most of them in hardback, but this is about her weakest to date. It's not a bad book, Baker couldn't write a bad book if she tried. The setting and science are convincing, the characters are colourful, mostly, the writing is good, it's never dull and there is always plenty going on.And at this point I imagine you're wondering what on Mars I'm moaning about and only giving it a three star rating for. The answer is fairly simple: the struggle of the protagonists is never really convincing. The baddies -the British Arean Corporation and its representative on Mars are straw men. There is never a moment when you doubt that our heroes will win the day because the antagonists are useless and easily manipulated. There is never any sense of real threat and, as a consequence, no real drama.It's a fun read but one without any substance."
4,Empress of Mars,An interesting book. It is the first that I have read by this author but I will definitely read more.
2,Got the disc -- but no movie!,"Wouldn't I just be the lucky one who received the box and the disc, but the disc was totally blank. Tried it on 3 computers and 2 dvd players, but nothing happened. Then I looked at the disc. Usually the recorded section will be visible if you shift the disc in the light. In my case, the disc appears to be blank.Unfortunately, I haven't been able to track down the private seller I bought it from to ask for an adjustment. I hope this is an isolated incident. I'd buy it again, but uneasy about it happening again."
1,"Disorganized, a blizzard of unfinished thoughts","I have been a step-parent to two wonderful children for almost two years. I recieved this book for xmas, I never would have bought it had I looked at any one page. The book reads like someone took 100 post it notes with tidbits of info on them and threw them together to create a book. Unfortunatley the information (if it can so be called) is nothing more then a bunch of questions and the author saying how difficult living with a stepchild will be, she says it over and over and over.... The book is set up with a small paragraph with an idea or a question followed by ""see more on this in chapter 9 or 14"" etc. It is not only not informative but it a very annoying book to read. I can sum this entire book up in one sentence ""Raising or Living with a step child/stepchildren is not easy, it is going to be stressful and challenging (see more on this at the beginning of my review)"" There I just saved you 20 dollars, now find a different book to buy."
1,This book doesn't tell you too much,"This was not a very informative book. I thought there were a lot of good ideas and a lot of different concepts brought out in it, however the author did not go into very much detail on any of the subjects. I thought it was also a little disorganized, the author seemed to delight in making the reader skip from section to section. I would keep looking for another book, this one is a definite one star."
3,Good for beginners,"This was the first stepparenting book I bought before marrying a man with children, and it's good as an introduction, but that's about it. If you're already a stepparent you probably already know everything in this book. It also takes a from-the-kids viewpoint, which isn't as helpful as books like The Enlighted Stepmother."
2,For idiots or for the lazy,"While reading this book, I was thinking whether anyone about to engage in such a serious thing as stepparenting (or, worse, already engaged in it) would have something to learn from this book. It appeared to me that this book would only be useful to those who never sat down to think. The task of being a stepparent is not to be taken lightly, since there are children's lives involved, but I think that the pessimism in this book can stir up negative emotions which can actually harm a stepfamily. Having said all that, sure, there may be a thing to learn or two, especially about some practical issues. I think there must be much better stuff to read out there."
4,Good option for 11mm mounts,There are not a lot of options out there for 11mm mounts. This is a good reasonable price option and allows for rough alignment with windage adjustments for receiver variance before scope reticule fine tuning. Be sure to read the instructions carefully or your scope won't even be on the back board let alone the target. Finish is a little plain - as in lightly blued fairly rough metal compared to some higher end rings. The hardware all looks industrial strength. If your are putting these on a CZ452 make sure to get high rings or the bolt handle might not clear the rear bell of your scope.
4,RED RACHAMS TREASURE,this book is about tin tin captain haddock and calculus.it is a good book filled with action suspense and humor.i think this would be a good book for starters.A.
4,Secret of the Unicorn II,"Herge, Red Rackham's Treasure (Methuen, 1948)Now we get to the meat of things. Our intrepid friends, accompanied by Professor Calculus, head off in search of the Unicorn. Needless to say, this is not as easy as it sounds, and sends the crew on wild goose chases that seem to be but excuses for Herge to draw underwater scenes. Not, mind you, that I'm denigrating the book, which is just as good as the one before it; once again, this is a book where nothing of real consequence takes place from a plot perspective (it is most notable today for being the first appearance of Calculus, the final main character to be introduced in the series' run), but it's still full of action, danger, and good fun. ***"
4,An excellent Tintin,I really enjoyed this story. The interaction of the Captain and Tintin is always enjoyable.
2,works for 2 weeks,"It looked nice at the begging,but after 2 weeks it fall because the stickers lost their stickiness"
1,Not Worth It!,"I did everything it said to do from the moment I opened the package. I made sure the surface was clean, held the clips in place for a while, let it sit over night and I even turned on the stove top and oven since it says it stick better once heat is applied. It all sounds good, but didn't work at all. This didn't stick longer than a few days before it popped right off. The money for this guard would have been better spent on a baby gate to keep my child away from the stove all together. This was a waste."
1,not that good,My son at 15 month old figured out how to pull it out sliding it..and at 20 month old just pull it completely out !!!NOT THAT STRONG for at least busy kids
1,Poor Quality and waste of money,"The seal came off after few days due to oven heat. Extremely useless item, save ur money, donot buy this. My 18 months old did even pull it off. We didnot use even for 2 weeks."
4,Works for its purpose,"This is the only stove guard I could find, and it seems to work pretty well. Just make sure you install it far enough away from the burners so the plastic won't melt if you cook right next to it (learned this the hard way, but reinstalled and is fine now). You can also buy replacement adhesive strips from the company's website if someone leans on it and ruins them (happened to us!). Overall, we are happy with it - just make sure to install it correctly!!Tips: be sure to clean the area before applying the adhesive. I also pushed on the adhesive for a couple minutes after putting it on. Also: install the clips with the adhesive first, then let it sit overnight before putting the stove guard on. Basically, follow the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. We have had ours up for over a year now."
1,Piece of junk,"Great item if you want an extra piece of plastic lying around the house. The box says it will stay bonded to the oven through high temps (around 525), but after 2 uses of the oven at about 350 degrees the 3M stickers no longer hold the seal and the shield falls off. Save your money, don't buy this."
2,If only the glue would stick . .,"This product was everything I wanted, but unfortunately the glue would not hold it in place. I did everything as instructed, because I knew that the bonding is the key ingredient here. I tried rebonding it several times, but eventually gave up. If you had a stove that you didn't mind bonding this to with some type of high grade glue for a permanent stick it would be perfect."
3,Not strong enough,"Two days after we attached the stove guard...it came off! Maybe it's our stove, but glue is glue, and if it's not sticky or strong enough to hold on all types of surfaces, then it should say so before you buy it. I am currently trying to find something to hold it back up as it TRULY IS a great idea, and I felt so much better about cooking with that guard all around."
1,Waste of money,"It is a great product from the time you bought it until you get home because it gives Mommy the feeling she has done something for the little ones safety.I installed it because Mommy insisted to do so and there was a tiny, tiny little spark of hope in me that this could actually work. While still installing (which by the way is very simple) my baby (17month) wanted to pull it down already. So here went my hope because I was sure in the first unwatched minute he pulled it down.Well I managed to keep it safe for 24 hours to make sure the tape would dry out and work at its best. Next morning I made scrambled eggs and the tape started to get loose because of the heat. I mean I only used half the heat available and it came loose, didn't even fry some steaks with full power....So my baby enjoyed pulling it down completely and throw it into the trash.While it lasted not long enough to clean it, I am sure it is a real headache to do so."
1,SHAME,"The Prince Lionheart people should be ashamed at the garbage they are selling us to protect our children. This junk is applied with stickers! I used a degreaser, followed by rubbing alcohol to clean area of application. The guard fell off with the very first use of the oven. Do not buy this...if you did and your are equally as upset...post a review. Shame on Prince Lionheart and shame on Amazon for selling this garbage."
2,worked for a little while,after just 6 month of using this product the 3M tape came off and couldnt get it to stick again. worst yet i cant find replacement tape for it.
2,never again,Fell off after a few minutes! I put it back and it was on for a few days but fell off again. Really bad product.
3,Stayed on for about a month,"We purchased two because our stove is on the end of our countertop. We cook on the range a lot, and the one on the front fell off after about a month. However, the other is still holding strong, so I don't know if it was the heat or if it got pushed/pulled too often. I'm buying some 3M VHB tape from Amazon and will give it a second try.As far as installation, the clips were a little hard to get onto the shields at first, but it's easy to adjust the width to fit your range.Overall, I'd say it's worth the price compared to the other options I've found."
4,Stove Guard,"I have been using this guard for about 3 weeks now, and it does exactly what it is suppose to do. My son is tall, and was reaching up for pans, and is now unable to get to them. I am very pleased with this product."
5,very happy,"just what i was looking for. fine and beautiful ,right length for all different pendants, very pleased, and would recommend"
5,Perfect for a child,"I got this necklace for my granddaughter to use with a cross and it is perfect for a child. It is very pretty, delicate and has a ""sparkle"" due to the way the links are interwoven. For an adult it might be a bit thin."
1,very bad quality,Necklace was damaged and of very low quality. Seems like there is no quality control in the manufacturer. Visible inperfections. Necklace should not have shipped like that.
4,Dainty,"Dainty and pretty. Looks very delicate, but so far holding up to the grabby hands of my 2 year old and 4 month old."
4,Nice Chain,"Nice chain with a pendant to complement a good price to look elegant, very suitable for being discreet size which enhances the distinction"
5,Lightweight Chain for Women,"A delicate chain and very pretty. The cut and finish on the chain really sparkles making it appear thicker. Bought for my daughter in law as a gift to go with a small dark purple amethyst set in 14K gold pendant.The combination was quite stunning and everyone in the room immediately noticed the sparkle to the chain. While I did not weigh the chain I could care less if it is lighter than advertised. The markup on new gold jewelry is so high that anyone looking for investment value should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a delicate, high quality, lightweight 14K gold chain for under $100.00 and backed by Amazon's incredible service then this is for you."
5,I never sick of this song :-),I can tell you I listened to this song and tried to sing along with it about 20+ times on the first day I heard of it. It gave me an emotional feeling when I listen to it. I don't know about you... but two big words... GET IT!!!
3,A good gift I suppose,"We purchased this as a gift for a family member who loves the movie ""A Christmas Story"" as this book was supposed to be the story it came from. We have not read it but find it odd that the book cover or description did not mention the movie."
2,Shepherd blows,"The book first of all, I could`n`t get the gist between the story and the title. Mr . Shepherd just seemed to ramble on about this and that with no continuity. I was expecting to read more on Ralph and his buddies. Another thing I did not like was there was no character building in the book. Hey I bought the book for 1 cent. The only good thing taken from this book is when the guys who made the move Christmas Story wrote the teleplay and turned it into the movie."
3,Depends on What you are Looking For,"I was anxious to order this title because I am such a huge fan of A Christmas Story. I enjoy the innocence and the nostalgia of that film. Those who order this title should be warned that the book is more bittersweet than the film; in fact, it's more bitter than sweet. And most of the elements from A Christmas Story are confined to the first chapter, so anyone hoping to renew the feel of the film will be disappointed."
3,An okay read...,"I read this book such a long time ago, I don't remember much of it now. I recall that it was difficult to get into."
1,Bad Language- No Thanks,"I purchased this book because I'm a big fan of Patrick F McManus and Pat recommended the author on his website. I'm used to Pat's stories where the language and humor are clean. Jean Shepherd is only mildly amusing and the foul language in his stories were a deal breaker for me. I got about 1/4 of the way through the book before deleting it from my Kindle. If the smut on TV and in movies isn't enough for you, by all means, buy this book."
2,Saw a Christmas Story too many times.,"For the first time ever, the movie made from the book was much better than the book. I thought it was kind of a downer, and a little disjointed. If you have seen the movie, don't bother to buy the book."
2,In God We Trust,"I couldn't finish this book. The story line did not flow very well. The language was kind of harsh, too."
4,Loving satire,"Jean Shepherd's deft, affectionate, daffy sendup of his depression era childhood is one of the most charming reads you'll ever stumble across.For those unfamiliar with Shepherd, his writing is a wonderfully relaxed, rambling sort of gentle satire. There's nothing especially laid back about reading it; you're going to laugh out loud at this book, and there's plenty of hypocrisy being skewered and all that. Shepherd just lacks the sort of bitterness you expect from some other ""humorists."" His overall tone is more amused self-deprecation than anything else.In short, Jean Shepherd makes the perfect bedtime read for grownups. This particular book also happens to include the chapter or two on which the classic movie ""A Christmas Story"" was based, so it's been rereleased in a form that'll make a relatively cheap, great gift under the tree."
4,"""In God we Trust - the ""Christmas Story"" and more.","I purchased this book in large print for my Father to enjoy, and ended up reading it myself. The popular movie classic ""The Christmas Story"" is partly based on this book. If you enjoyed the movie, then the book is an entertaining read. The collection of stories is full of entertaining, funny and nostalgic anecdotes from the author, Jean Shepherd, who is quite the wit and storyteller."
5,You can go home again,"This book took me back, an interesting assortment of characters who shaped the time(s) and town(s) we all grew up in. From the school yard bully to the nosey neighbor to the town oddities, they are all there. You'll remember things from that time that you thought you forgot."
4,Piano Vocal Purchase,Took a bit longer than I expected but when it arrived it was exactly what I expected. Thank you. Amazon is a great source of hard to find books and music.
4,IF YOU LIKE WESTERN SWING YOU NEED THIS.,"I HAVE TO SAY JOHNNIE LEE IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS OF HIS BROTHER BOB WILLS OR THE YOUTHFULL FUN OF HIS BROTHER BILLY JACK WILLS, STILL THIS IS A GOOD ONE THAT YOU WILL ENJOY. UNFORTUNATELY A FEW OF THE TRACKS HAVE THAT ANOYING HISS THAT ACOMPANIES A LOT OF OLD TIME MUSIC."
4,How I want this to become a reality!,"I was required to read Connecting for a class and I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up enjoying the book. I finished the book longing to have a relationship like the one he describes, where Christians point each other to Christ, and jump up and down for each other. I can just imagine how applying this book would change my church and my circle of friends and my life and their lives. I intend to use his ideas in some of my own friendships and relationships, and in future ministry. Thank you Dr. Crabb for a challenging and convicting book."
4,Practical Spirtual Encouragement,I read the book 1st time in 1997 with a so so opinion. I recently listened to the audio and re-read the book. The difference is that I now need the spiritual direction in encouragement through spiritual commnuity. I found it to be powerfully and scripturally practical for those who have a faith in the power of the gospel and the Holy Spirit. It also helps to have read INSIDE OUT.
1,Not What I Expected,"This book is mostly stories and illustrations. I also had difficulty following his reasoning on occasions. Perhaps I was expecting something like the excellent ""Psychology, Theology, and Spirituality in Christian Counseling"" by Mark McMinn, or even something like ""Competent to Counsel"" by Jay Adams. It would also have been helpful if the author had included some helpful sources. JB Myers"
5,This is the book i've been looking for,This is simply a great book. Larry Crabb has captured a whole lot of spiritual and councelling concepts into what I believe to be a robust biblical framework. Its power lies in its simplicity and gospel foundation. It has shifted the way I relate in a positive and sustainable way.
5,Brilliant for Pastoral Counseling,This book is so easy to read and applicable it should be a must for every church library and counseling office. The book demonstrates and applies life changing ways in which to counsel and be available for dynamic relationships. It shows the pastor and counselor how to apply effective connections that bring true healing through the power of the relationship..........
4,Fast paced and enjoyable,This is the third Elizabeth Lowell book I've read and so far I'm enjoying the pattern. I like knowing who the bad guys are and watching our couple figure out the mystery. Add some pent up sexual frustration and it's golden! This book takes us on the search for diamonds and gives us a glimpse into the dangerous underworld. I read this in 2 days time b/c I just couldn't put it down. Ms. Lowell does a great job keeping the suspense going all the way till the end and left me wanting more.
3,Ok but not up to author's usual standard.,This book is not as good as other Elizabeth Lowell books. I have read just about everything she has written and there was mediocre. There was not a lot of action or much romance.
2,Be careful!,"I bought this Peerless plasma stand for my new Panasonic 42"" Plasma. The description didn't explain that the stand requires an ""adapter plate"" for most plasma TVs. I spent a morning getting all of the wiring setup, cleared the spot for the TV and assembled the stand. Only then did I learn that I would need a special Peerless adapter plate. Buying this adapter plate will cost another $80, including shipping.The bottom line is that I wouldn't have bought this stand if I knew an additional plate was required to attach the TV."
5,I love it more than my wife.,"This mount suits my purposes perfectly. It's very sturdy and holds my 31 Lb, 46 inch Vizio M3D460SR very easily. I'd buy another one if I could afford to buy another TV to put on it!"
5,Parental alienation syndrome,This is an excellent resource for anyone going through a high conflict divorce.
3,"Like the book, didn't know it was written in by the previous owner",I started to read my book which looked good on the outside and was surprised to see the worksheets at the end of the chapter filled out. I was quite disappointed about this.
3,"Good hiking info, the rest is mediocre","This book has plenty of good info on places to hike all over SD (from short urban hikes to mountains to the desert), but the camping section is limited to contact info for campgrounds. You can get better info (w/pics) on the net. The biking portion is limited, and is 95% routes for road bikes. I was expecting some mtn. bike trails."
4,"Some very fine, rare songs here","Rhino has done it again, pulling together some of Warwick's hidden gems and letting them breathe on a disc mastered with precision and care. ""Love Songs"" is super smooth. The full romantic effect is achieved, and it's easy to overlook the few selections that are overplayed(""Say a Little Prayer"" for instance). ""I Didn't Mean to Love You"", a single that got yanked early, is amazing, with an impromptu ""Lord have mercy!"" from Dionne in a complete romantic dither. It's just one fabulous moment on this do-not-miss disc."
5,A Gem...,"Love Songs (Rhino) spans 12 years from Dionne's Career (1964 to 1976), it includes some of Miss Warwick's most pleasing & memorable love songs. Her outstanding style & elegance is portrayed in the beautiful ""You'll Never Get To Heaven"" (If You Break My Heart), ""Love Song"". Her voice is quintessential on the classics "" I say a little prayer"" & ""Dream Sweet Dreamer"". The ultimate album Gem is towards the end...the rare "" I didn't mean to love you"" is perhaps one of the finest Warwick songs ever recorded. On the whole, this is an album that shouldn't be missed. Recommended."
1,Bet you can't get past the first chapter!,The first reviewer had it right at one point. This is froth - fuming with deadly poisons. Stay away from it. Such trite - even Danielle Steel winces when she reads claptrap like this. A mystery it isn't. Stay with Sue Grafton & only read Kilian if you have nothing better to do!
3,Homage to Kurosawa's Seven Samurai,"But it's more on the level of the misnamed Magnificent Seven. In other words, what could have been a wonderful homage (Parker certainly has the gift--I actually moved to Boston because he made the city so real!) struggles along but never pans out. The plot is thin, the character interactions -which could have been wonderful- are pedestrian, and the climax and resolution are a let-down.It's probably a good-enough read if you never make the Seven Samurai connection, but when you boil it down and skim the fat off, there's not much left."
2,not one of his best,"My dad and I love Parker, he's one of our favorite authors. But this is not Parker at his best. In fact, we'd rate this one of the worst, if not the worst, in the Spenser series. Don't waste your money on the hard cover, get the paperback. The book lags too often in places and it seems to be written to bring in characters from other books."
5,Spencer meets the WildWest,I've been looking forward to this book since I first heard the idea mooted. Lived up to expectations. Thoroughly enjoyable but why not invite Chollo?
3,"Missed you, Spenser!","It is so nice to have another Spenser book to read. I have missed Spenser and Hawk and their verbal jousting. Another decent read from Parker, but not one of his best!"
4,A Pot of Gold,This is a great book. It starts out with a terrific plot. Spenser is hire by Lou to get rid a couple of thugs out of Potshot. But are things what they seem. Suspense will gripe you from page to page. The ending is killer. While this is not the best of series. But worth reading.
4,The Magnificent Seven ala Parker,"While this is an entertaining read, it is one of the least complex of Parker's books. This is very obviously Parker's take on the Seven Samarai/Magnificent Seven story. My biggest issue with the book was the lack of any complication to the climax. After a great deal of lead up, the story is resolved far too swiftly. If this were any other characters except for the beloved Parker characters, I would not be retaining my copy of this book."
3,Far from Parker's best,"This clever riff on The Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven has Spenser rounding up six of his tough-guy acquaintances from previous books to help rid an Arizona town of a gang of outlaws that is terrorizing it. You can can always count on Parker for neat characterization and snappy dialogue, but this book is undone by its by-the-numbers plot (containing a gigantic hole) and by Spenser's constant raving and moaning about girlfriend Susan Silverman, which is getting really monotonous. The book feels like a first draft, with 4-page chapters filled mostly with clipped dialogue. Still, there are worse characters to spend a couple of hours with than Spenser. But if you're new to the series, start with one of the other books."
2,The Plot Was Phoned In!,"I've read every Spenser mystery, and through the years each one has become just a little less of a ""good read."" This is the worst of the lot. It's enjoyable because it's another in the Spenser series, but the series is becoming as bad as Lillian Jackson Braun's 'The Cat Who...."" books....you know, let's make something up to sell another book....call the plot in and be damned with it...and with the readers!"
2,Sad,"I enjoy the Spenser series. I have read maybe 10 so far, and plan on getting them all eventually. The characters are fun, the stories are interesting, the dialog is perky, and the action is exciting. Sure, I often skim over a lot of the ""Susan"" stuff, and I do get tired of over-long descriptions of food/clothing. But I generally enjoy these books.Potshot is easily the worst one I have encounted. Admittedly, the typical ""Spencer"" plot is not a paragon of coherance/continuity. In ""Potshot"", however, it becomes so problematic that it detracts a lot from enjoyment of the story. I won't bother to list the holes and inconsistancies here, it's just not worth the time. Other reviews have mentioned the unsatisfiying ending, so I won't dwell on that either. All I will say is that, as I turned the last page and closed the book, I was filled with disappointment. ""Phoned it in"" was my first thought.I do strongly recommend this series. But this is NOT the one to start with."
4,An improvement...,"""Potshot"" is an improvement over the last two or three Spenser novels, particularly over ""Hugger Mugger,"" simply because the locale and storyline are very engaging. I can't understand readers who are quibbling over lack of ""originality"" in the series--what, after thirty years of Spenser novels, do you expect? Spenser to become an astronaut? Maybe to run for President? All I ask is a workable story and interesting characters, and ""Poshot"" supplies both. Long live Spenser, and may the literary gods protect him from those who apparently think that they could come up with more original Spenser ideas than Parker does, and who also believe that they could produce thirty years of anything without borrowing from themselves along the way. Get real."
3,Potshot; or The Magnificent Seven Revisited,"Only Robert Parker fans will let him get away with this effort. With Spenser in the Yul Brenner role and Hawk as a supporting Steve McQueen, the good guys round up a collection of politically correct compadres (black, gay, American Indian, hispanic, Italian enforcer from Vegas) to clean the bad guys out of Potshot, Arizona. The dialogue, as always, is worth the effort of reading the book but the plot is pure Hollywood B western. There is a sub-plot of murder, greed, and land speculation but these seem to become secondary to the ambush of the bad guys at the Spenser compound. Spenser and Hawk are urban cowboys. Taking them out of their environment detracts from the legitimacy of what they do. Parker has seen the movie The Magnificent Seven too many times. If this trend continues in the future..."
2,Wild West Spenser,"I don't know why I do it, but when I see a new Parker on the shelf I decide to give him another chance. This is more of the same old stuff,get a client,listen to their story,take the case ,schmooze with Susan,pet the dog,cook a meal or two,go to Cimoli's gym,find Hawk,same wisecracks back and forth.Now the middle of the book,someone threatens Spenser,he retaliates,meets with local law enforcement,gets warned to stay off the case,calls Susan for advice and encouragement,and goes back to ""sticking his nose where it don't belong"" untill someone reacts.Now it's time to bring in Hawk and whoever else he needs for backup and expose the killer and head back to Boston to Susan and the Mutt. Yawnnnnn ! enough of this drivel, I'll just leave it on the shelf!"
3,SPENSER'S MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,"Spenser is not at his best when he's faced with the task of cleaning up a gang (see Double Deuce, Thin Air)-the book reads a lot like an A-Team episode. But it's still Spenser. That counts for something.That said, Parker's latest is still worthwhile for fans of the series but may come off as a little far-fetched to new readers. The characters are well done, even though their main purpose is to reinforce to the reader how different Spenser is from each of them. A little too much of that is made in this book, with all of them commenting ad naseum on Spenser's ""rules"" and Hawk reminding everyone ""that's what makes him different from us""Not a lot of new ground is covered here, but it is still a worthwhile read for Parker fans!"
2,just plain bad,"How can a book that is at least 125 pages too long manage to have an abrupt and unfulfiling conclusion? Maybe if Parker would quit cranking out books like they were on an assembly line, he might produce a work that is at least entertaining."
4,"Fun story, uneven narration","Joe Mantegna, who played Spencer in the recent A&E; movies, does a passable job in narrating this tale. His Spencer is erudite and dry, really done quite well.He does less well, though, with the other rolls. Hawk's accept is different every time he speaks. Susan and the other women sound -- well, anything but sexy. And I'm sure that, even with the ""unabridged"" label, there would have been some way to elide out the over-repetitive ""he said""/""I said"" bits of dialog -- what works well on the printed page is horribly distracting when read aloud.All that said, so to speak, it's a decent enough Spencer tale -- a ""Magnificent Seven"" with Spencer in the lead (and Hawk as Yul Brynner). A light and frothy audio book quite suitable for commute time."
1,Potshot,"A total waste of my time. I found the narration dull. I have not read any of the other novels by this author, nor do I ever plan to. N"
2,Eastern Western???,"Great dialog, little action, no closed ending. Borrow this from the library - or a friend."
3,A tired plot,"Spenser goes out west to be the white hat to ride in and clean out the baddies in a town. Sound familiar? The ""good citizens"" pay him and he gathers his own crew of thugs to fight the local gang of thugs. The problem is, you can't really tell the bad guys without a program. One has to wonder if any of the real crooks were punished. Oh yes, there is shootout at the end, and a lot of people get gunned down, but those are all spear carriers. How about the people with the money? The dialog sometimes leaves a little to be desired - something along the lines of ""Me Tarzan, you Jane."""
2,A disapointment,"While the beginning kept my attention, the plot was weak, the characters were not very believable -- even the old stand bys like Hawk -- too worldly and intellectual -- for a tough guy goon. Even though I've been a Hawk fan in the past. And the ending was a boring let down. Not exciting or interesting. Kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Have been a Parker fan for years, and this was a disapointment."
2,Unsatisfying,"These days, reading a Spenser mystery is like reading a comic book, which is OK -- I usually read them like candy after I read something really good. But Potshot wasn't even as entertaining as most comic books. The plot and the action were a tease -- neither went anywhere. And the ending was totally lame. For a similar but better book try Lee Child's Echo Burning. I love his descriptions of the desert and the heat, and his hero, Reacher, actually beats up the bad guys (fun!) and doesn't need to get his girlfriend and a bunch of his friends to tell us how wonderful he is."
4,Good Spenser novel,"I won't bother explaining the plot, The two previous reviewers have done a good job of that. Rather I'd like to welcome Spenser back. He seemed to have gone missing in Hugger Mugger but now he's back, as smart-alecky and tough as ever. And there's more as Mr. Parker brings together a bunch of previous tough guys from Spenser's other novels. Tedy Sapp is here, along with Chollo, Bobby Horse, Vinnie, Bernard J. Fortunato, and of course, Hawk. The whole thing is great fun and almost reminds you of the Earps versus the Daltons. Not great literature perhaps, but a good fun read. I recommend it."
4,Spenser Back on Top,"I would agree with most reviewers that the last few Spenser books were at best poor efforts. With Potshot, Parker is once again in great form. It was great to see some characters from past books appear in this one.One can only wonder what Parker will do next. I'd like to see a bit more about Spenser's past and have him grow in character, but if it ain't broke why fix it?"
4,Gumshoes and Westerns!,For the most part Potshot plays out just like any other Spenser novel.Which is pretty good. But it's nice to see Parker playing with genres and doing something a bit different here with Spenser and his handpicked team. I wish there would have been more with Spenser's magnificent seven. But Potshot is a good solid read. It's nice to see Parker branching out a bit. Here's hoping he does more.
3,The master is getting stale,"I actually feel guilty saying it because i have been reading Spenser since 1985, I was pretty young then and Parker's style and Spenser's morals both had a big influence on me. Spenser will always be one of my favorite literary characters but at this point I feel like Ive read every line before. I dont think he could ever top the passion or epic feel of ""A Catskill Eagle"" my personal favorite and i think the most character-defining of them all. Other favorites of mine include""Valediction"" ""Judas Goat"" ""Mortal Stakes"" and ""Early Autumn"". Read those to see Parker in top form. I guess its forgivable if recent additions like Potshot or Hugger Mugger are predictable and contain no character development. Parker's one of the best and has contributed alot of great books to the world, not every artist has new things to say forever."
4,Potshot -- Classic Spenser... Again.,"If you're familiar with the Spenser series, I'll save you a ton of time and say, ""Read _Potshot_, it's classic Parker and you won't be disappointed.""If you're not familiar, I'll write a bit more. The world Robert B. Parker created around the Boston detective Spenser (precursor to the `Spenser for Hire' TV series) is simply complex. While the book can stand on it's own, _Potshot_ integrates characters from dozens of prior Spenser novel. Having spent time with these characters (and their motivations) in prior novels gives this book a richness that will escape first time readers.In terms of plot, yes, this is a mystery novel, but the mystery is usually an afterthought to character development. The off-the-cuff discussions Spenser and his cohorts have over breakfast regarding guns are far more interesting than whodunit. If you're looking for complex plot, keep moving... Parker writes characters and he writes them well."
3,"Not great, but still good, Spenser","Spenser is an ageless smart aleck ... decidedly un-PC in how he talks to his hired thugs/friends and most definitely still a rebel. And, in an ending that genuinely surprised me, still very much a romantic. So in all, there's nothing in this book that tells us anything about Spense that those familiar with the series don't already know. And I agree with the reviewers who have noted that while Pearl is aging, Susan and Hawk and most of all Spenser are still in their primes. It's an annoying distraction. When we hear Spenser mention Korea, it forces us to do the math and realize that all this derring do is being done by a man of (at least) 65. Parker should borrow from the Kinsey Milhone series and set his protagonist in a very definite time and keep him there. STILL, I enjoyed the book. Time spent with Spenser is alway time well spent. This just isn't one of the best."
5,"Less about Spencer, More about Parker","Totally enjoyable and more of the same. Spencer does the Magnificent Seven. Enjoy Potshot it is pure fun.I think I have read every Spencer novel, in fact probably every novel that Parker has written. And I've come to view Parker's novels are being more about exploring the veiled themes in his life and how to explore new themes and creative ideas while staying with the confines of a popular genre. What next Robert B? You've done Spencer as a woman (Sunny Randall). You've done Spencer if he had become an alcoholic cop (Jesse Stone).Why not age Spencer finally. Why does Pearl grow old and not Spencer? He's closing on seventy I think. I would vote for seriously exploring how to be tough and aging. Relevant to the boomer population."
1,Review of Potshot,"I've always liked Robert Parker's Spenser novels, but this one was boring and slow moving. I thought it would never end. I would certainly not recommend this to anyone.Linda Carder"
2,Below par for Spenser stories,Skip this one unless you've read all the others and are desperate for one more. Parker's plot is thin and contrived. The characters aren't believable. The setting in the Arizona desert lacks color and depth : Parker should have kept Spenser in Boston where he knows the lay of the land. Spencer novels are fun....Potshot just doesn't stand up well in comparison.
5,Quintessential Spencer,"It helps to read Parker's books in the order written. This one, in particular, builds nicely on several previous Spencer novels."
3,"Starts fast, then blows an engine.","Spenser fans rejoice, this one belongs in your collection.Very entertaining departure from the classic formula. Spenser and Hawk bring a teamto the Nevada desert to investigate a murder and ogle a hot widow in even hotter hotpants. The dialogue sizzles for a while but loses steam and the story ends up goingpretty much nowhere without the anticipated plotline you had mapped out in your head.In the end, unsatisfying except for a few classic Parker keepers."
4,BAYBEE GIFT,I purchased this item as a baby shower gift. The recipient was very pleased with the quality and it is so cute!
2,the camera looks sexy and sleek but the pictures are sloppy,"This was my first digital camera and was very excited (and carried away) how sleek and sexy looking this camera was. Once I started taking pictures, my resentment started growing - pictures are not crisp (a 3.0 MP camera would do better), flash is poor, spots appear in the picture (thought it was some dirt on the lens but no, that wasn't it).Overall, if you want stylish and cool (looking) camera, go for it. If you want good pictures, stay away from it.Note: The picture may look crisp and clear when you view them on the LCD but when you download them onto your PC, you'll regret. So, it is a good choice if you're using this to take snaps and show to friends and not serious about printing or downloading them."
5,Amazing,This camera is very cool. I had a T-1 before and this one is even better. The touchscreen thing is just awsome... almost no buttons in the camera itself. 100% satisfyed.
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this to replace my aging Nikon Coolpix. I like the functionality of the touch screen, makes the comprehensive menu really easy to use. But this cannot compensate for the poor picture quality. Colors are dull and images are not sharp. Also saw some circular shadows in some of the flash shots. Disappointing for a camera of this spec and pricing. Stick with Nikon or Canon."
2,Don't take it on a ski trip,"I was initially ecstatic about the quality of the photos on this camera. I also was happy with the steady shot and the bright screen that was visable in daylight even with sunglasses.This is my 3rd digital camera and I am an experienced user.On a ski trip last week I was extremely disappointed that the 4GB memory stick I used had numerous ""file errors"" and I lost an entire day of amazing unreproducible photos and movies.I tried reformatting the card and a number of other maneuvers and found that in the cold, only the internal memory worked and with the 7MP setting I could take 11 photos.My other ""beef' was that I could not charge the battery through the adapter cable, even with the correct kensington charger tipOtherwise it seems to work well and is quite ergonomic."
1,Major problems with flash,"I have had this camera for 2 weeks now. Initially I liked the camera but more I use it more problems I find with it. I started noticing that while spots and such artifacts on some pictures, mainly when using flash. After looking closely I found most picture taken with flash having this problem. Also, the images in general are not as sharp as my older Coolpix 5000. I am really disappointed with this camera."
1,stove guard,"Sounds great - but think like a two year old for a moment. All you have to do is rotate the plastic, pull really hard and it will slide out."
1,Does NOT work!,"I bought these for my 15-month old, because he started turning the knobs on the stove now. We own a GE free-standing gas stove with knobs you need to push in and turn to ignite. I even tried using two of these Kid Kushions stacked together, and I could still push in and turn on my ranges. I don't know what type of oven they work on, but they don't work for my oven!"
1,Do not purchase- don't even consider it,"I bought these because our stove top knobs are very easy to accidentally turn. This issue has caused numerous scary gas leaks. Although there were many negative reviews about this product, I decided to purchase it anyways. BIG mistake. This product arrived in packaging that looks like it is from the 1980's, and perhaps it is. In addition, this product looks like junk. Furthermore, it does absolutely NOTHING! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Although cheap, it is a waste of money. I do not know the solution to our problem, but I do know that this is not it and I STRONGLY advise anyone not to waste their time and money on this product."
3,"works on some ovens, not others","I actually bought these after an incorrigible (and very lucky!) cat of mine walked across the stovetop when it was off, and accidentally turned on one of the burners. On that stove, these worked PERFECTLY. Then I moved to another place with a different stove and these are useless on it. It all has to do with how much ""clearance"" there is between the back of the knob and the surface of the panel. If it's a snug fit, these will work great, but if there's much of a gap, these won't help. I'll be buying the bubble-style knob covers for the stove I have now."
2,Don't work,"Knobs seem to work only on newer stoves. The knobs on the older ones do not have the ""catch"" to engage the stopping mechanism to impede the turning of the knobs."
1,Worthless!,"Not only did these not keep you from being able to push in the knobs and turn the burner on, is sometimes made is so it bypassed the lighting function and just turned the gas on!! I think it made my oven more dangerous!!"
5,Worked great for a knob that turned with the slightest bump,"We have a stove with a knob that turns on the oven with the slightest brush; unfortunately the stove is right next to the sink, so it was way too easy to turn on the oven by accident with a bump of the hip. The Kid Kushion was perfect for this purpose. Now the knob can still be turned, but it has to be done with deliberation rather than by accident.The Kid Kushion is a piece of thick, clear plastic or rubber, that can be slipped on either from the top or by pulling off and then replacing the knob.Not sure that this would be ideal for little kids though, since we can still turn the knob."
2,Product didn't work for me,"I don't have small children and I bought these because we've accidentally turned the gas knob without knowing it, likely from bumping the stove when working in the kitchen. This has happened a few times and since I have no ability to smell, it's a big problem.I read the review that there are some stoves this product doesn't work on at all and I happen to own one (Whirlpool AccuBake gas stove). I gave the review 2 stars because I knew this was a possibility and returning the product was simple. Using these on my stove did nothing. They didn't prevent the knob from accidentally turning at all and as one reviewer (Waiting Mom) posted it "" ..sometimes .. bypassed the lighting function and just turned the gas on!! "". For me, these knobs didn't work and in a way I feel it made the problem worse."
4,johnny winter-live from japan,"For all Johnny Winter fans out there. Must have must get this dvd. For those who know about Johnny, and qhat he has been through over the last 10yrs or so he is on the up????."
4,"Nice sound, good look and a good value...","The sound is quite good for outdoor speakers disguised as rocks. I am using four of these in my back yard and driving them with a high quality Denon amp. I use an iPod running through an external DAC as the source and my favorite music sounds clear, detailed and open. The bass is fairly accurate and tight and extends down to exceptable low frequencies. I don't think I will be adding a subwoofer. I have the sandstone color and the look is nice."
4,Garner started a new genre,"Maverick is at his best as the cowboy - gambler who is the smartest guy in the room but used quips instead of arrogance to make his points. He is almost the anti-hero, because he isn't the fastest gun and knows it. He uyses his brains and sense of humor to win the day. He also has a strong sense of right and wrong, which was probably odd for a professional gambler.I love all the garner Mavericks and wish they would release more.Given that these were had in the 50's, they are all family friendly."
3,Get to the point,"My problem with this book is that it takes a long time to get to the plot. In the usual Sayers' story, there's a body/murder/mystery on the very first page and it then takes off. This book does not. You have to read about 40% of the book (on a Kindle) before anything happens. Once the murder investigation gets going it gets better. I agree with the reviewer who says this is not quite Sayers' voice - I don't think she would have had so much wordy exposition. Plus this business between Harriet and her sister-in-law Helen, Duchess of Denver, over babies and heirs - hmmm..."
4,A little relief for those who have run out of Wimsey,"I loved the Lord Peter - Harriet Vane romance. This book attempts to extend the story beyond ""Busman's Honeymoon"" and I think does so quite successfully. They say Dorothy Sayers described herself as in love with Lord Peter - aren't we all? If you've read the original novels to bits and you'd like something fresh, here it is."
2,"Good effort, but&#65533;","As a fan of Sayers' Lord Peter books, I looked forward to reading Walsh's effort based on Sayers' notes. While the plot is good, Walsh fails to capture the delightful and very literary style Sayers displayed in the original Wimsey books."
2,decent story but poor imitation of Sayers,"Walsh's vioce, or, rather, an absense of Sayers', is painfully obvious in the later parts of this book. Although the story is decent, Walsh possesses neither Sayers' mastery of the English language nor her ability to create subtle, intellectual exercises. By itself the book is decent, albeit not overly memorable, but as an attempt at another Wimsey novel it is sorely lacking."
2,"Not bad; not Lord Peter; and worst of all, not Sayers","I should have known better. I thought that the pleasurable reading experience arose from Lord Peter and his brother, Denver, his formidable dowager mother, and all the other interesting characters from Bunter to Harriet and back again. But it wasn't created by them, it was Sayers. The characters she created were the instrument, but it was the lines they were given that I was enjoying. Without the wit and erudition Lord Peter comes across as a paper mache copy. Parker walks through his scenes, and Bunter is a shallow version of a gentleman's gentleman.The writing is not bad; but it's not Sayers"
5,A dream come true!,"I have a recurring dream in which I am reading a new book by one of my favorite authors, now unfortunately deceased. Not only do I have the complete text, but there are also several hundred new books that I have not yet read. Naturally when I wake up I can no longer remember the stories involved. Jill Paton Walsh has made my dream come true! I notice that at the end of Thrones, Dominations there is a rounding off of the characters later lives. I hope that doesn't mean that she will not make an effort to come up with her own Wimsey novels in the future? If anyone could do it Walsh could. Now if only someone could do a true Georgette Heyer my teenage dreams would come true! Linda Shoare, Head Librarian Salem Free Public Library"
3,"Good try, but no sequels necessary","Although I have to admire Walsh for attempting to emulate Sayers' style, lack of attention to details made the book not ring true. I thought the spirit of Lord Peter was captured pretty well, but what is lacking is true knowledge of each of the characters, especially Harriet Vane. For example, as an established writer of crime, Harriet would not need Lord Peter to explain the difference between murder and manslaughter -- she would have learned that on her mother's knee, so to speak. If Walsh wanted to explicate this issue, there were plenty of characters lacking expertise through whom she could have made her point. In all, it was enjoyable, but it also made me wish Sayers had written more before switching to religion."
2,Not whimsical enough,"She does a decent job with this but I tend to attribute that to her access to Sayers notes. Let's be honest about this book: it's fan fiction. It's not bad fanfic, but it is still derivative copying. Walsh is best at getting the feel of Sayers' dialog, particularly the patter of the Dowager Duchess and, occasionally, Peter himself. But she fails utterly with Uncle Paul, whose letters should be in French. Worst of all, she forgot the first rule of storytelling: show, don't tell.Cute, but it belongs at Fanfiction.net and Walsh should certainly make up her own characters instead of beating the Wimsey horse to death."
4,Lord Peter and Harriet return,"The Dorothy L. Sayers saga has been continued by Jill Paton Walsh in THRONES, DOMINATIONS as the duo proceed through their early days of Marriage in 1936. Although sketched out by Sayers, the mystery was fleshed out by Walsh some 60 years later in a highly readable and enjoyable mystery. Sayers fans may find the language and texture somewhat lacking, but I found the husband and wife protagonists to be to be credible and in keeping with the original. Those who admired the superb writing of Sayers should enjoy the trilogy of Walsh mysteries that take Lord Peter and Harriett into two decades of marriage."
2,Somewhat embarassing,"Walsh uses a heavy hand to plaster over her lack of any real sense of the characters with irrelevant historical detail and misused motifs from the Wimsey canon. If you are a Wimsey fanatic, you won't be able to keep yourself from reading it, but be forewarned; you will find none of the graceful erudition, effortlessly reproduced vernacular, or delightful wordplay you found in Dorothy Sayer's completed works."
2,You're better off with Sayers alone,"Speaking as a person who began reading Sayers' Wimsey books at the age of nine, I found the contributions of Ms. Walsh to be crudely apparent. It does not seem that she understands the characters very well. Regarded on its own, this is a moderately successful book, hence the two stars, but if you are seeking Lord (and Lady) Peter, it is much more rewarding to read any of Sayers' unaided works."
1,The title is the best part,"Sayers it is not. You can pretty much see the drop-off where Sayers leaves off and the new gal takes on, not far in.Not worth your money. Frankly, not worth a trip to the library, except as a curiosity."
4,Seamless?,"No, sorry, if you know Sayers well, you definitely know where Walsh starts off.All the same it's a nice read, and the Sayers part is, as always, worth it.:-)"
1,Not bad on it's own but also not Sayers,Although I'm glad to know that Sayers intended Peter & Harriet to have a happy ending. I think I knew that without reading this book. I wonder if Sayers notes weren't very extensive. The mystery seemed to be an after thought and didn't even begin untill the book was half over. I was annoyed by the fact that this author felt the need to work nearly every other character we've ever met in Sayers books in to this one. I found the introduction of a charachter that was bassicaly a femaly Bunter redundant. I'm also of the opinion that Bunter himself would have been appauled at the attempt to tie him up like a lose end. I don't want to say the book was all bad. I enjoyed it while I read it but I think other fans of Sayers works might find themselves dissapointed.
1,I wish I'd never read this,"Disgusting. For anyone who has any respect for Dorothy Sayers' oeuvre, this is a book to stay as far away from as possible. The plot is farfetched. The prose is trashy, clunking, and altogether painful to read. Having polluted my mind with this pathetic and grotesque attempt to complete Sayers' last, unfinished novel, I can only hope the passage of time and rereading of the other Wimsey novels will eventually erase the impact of this one from my mind."
1,A crime,"Walsh took the notes that Sayers left for a Wimsey/Vane mystery, and finished it. I'd rather they had simply published the notes. It is quite obvious where Sayers notes ended, and Walsh is simply incapable of writing in anything like Sayers' voice. And she hasn't a clue about the psychology of the Lord and Lady Peter. Walsh may well write decent novels of her own, but I wish she'd kept her hands off Peter and Harriet."
2,Very Weak Tea,"I bought this book at a garage sale cuz I liked the cover. Well, you know what they say ... can't tell a book by its cover. Lol.Sorry, there just isn't any ""beef"" here, as in, ""Where's the beef?"" I heard of Dorothy Sayers and Peter Whimsey and really thought I was getting my hands on a classic. I read the whole thing cuz I was away in a beach house and there wasn't anything else to read.I was bored. The characters, the plot ... nothing except the cover, really, was worth reacting to.There's just no THERE there. Or here. Just none.I didn't dislike the characters; I just couldn't FIND the characters.Snoozeville.Oh, I forgot. There is one good scene. It's when characters go into a sewer. The sewer is described really well. You read that and think, why couldn't the writer do that for the whole book? One brief scene does not a novel make."
5,Great Mos Espa Podracers,"The set was bigger than expected. Great fun for my son to put together. The seller was awesome (that's just an aside) Overall, we are extremely happy with the product!!"
2,DOESN'T QUITE FLY,"This made for TV flick certainly makes an impact on just how devastating a pandemic of the dreaded bird flu could impact the world. That's the film's main problem--it is so heavy handed and somber that it doesn't really flesh out the storylines to make us care for the people. It's almost like a documentary; nothing really ""happens.""Joely Richardson is lovely but her performance is lifeless; Scott Cohen fares a little better as the obsessed governor of Virginia; and Stacy Keach is appropriately bureaucratic. Ann Cusack takes acting honors, however, as the widow of the businessman responsible for bringing the virus into America. She evokes a lot of sympathy as a wife and mother who takes charge when things get really bad.A dark, disturbing if ultimately uneventful movie, though."
4,I thought that this movie was better than average,"It is true that it showed almost like a documentary; and I liked that about this movie. Many disaster movies focus on several troubled relationship and the main theme of the disaster is only a back drop; not so with this film. After watching this movie, I actually felt that I knew more about avion flu and how various government agencies MIGHT deal with the problems that develop."
2,"Very, very basic.....perhaps too much so","This book is a collection of recipes, down-home-isms, and basic common-sense stuff. If you already have your feet on the ground, save your money. On the other hand, if you're flighty, insecure, and fearful, this book may be just the thing for you."
5,Gets to the heart of the matter,"Perhaps the previous reviewer should check this book out more carefully. I found the 401(k) contribution limits in Table 8.3 on page 123. It has more than enough detail for me, but doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive encyclopedia of financial instruments. I like the writing and the experience that the author brings to project. But I think the real strength of this book is that it helps the reader face his or her various denial strategies about their money. Diane McCurdy understands people really well and she's not going to let anyone get away without seriously examining their money issues. And it's so well-written, I'll even pay for the experience."
4,Mark from Texas,"Diane takes complicated subject matters down to the basics for all of us, and does it beautifully. This is a must read for the responsible person desiring financial fulfillment and freedom. A retirement nest egg should start immediately, and Diane explains the various choices in one the most user friendly formats I've seen in a long time. Once we understand ourselves, our wants and needs, then the financial trappings/battles can be overcome and won. She does a masterful job in helping us identify who we really are."
1,NOOOOOO,"Hell, I loved MVP for 2 years!! Then there's dissapointment! What happened? Graphic got worse. Nomar is slimmer than Olsen Twins, and David Ortiz looks short! Only good thing is Owner Mode. The rest suck. Now I'm waiting for MLB 2006"
4,The Closing Act?,This is EA Sports MVP Baseball 2005 and possibly the last MVP Baeball ever due to the fact that ESPN has a 3 years contract with the baseball player's association.Pros: At points i could see a players face on the jumbotron. It is harder to hit homeruns. Thne teams are accurate. They don't have annoying ESPN jingles. It is a challenge. It has the spring training mode. The batting stances are good. The stadiums are good. I can see virtual fans faces. They have music for a batter. The deliveries are different.Cons: No Barry Bonds. Many made up players. Announcers aren't well known. No pre or post game show.Bottomline is MvP Baseball is still the games to beat and it won't be back for a while.
4,Surprisingly fun,"I bought this game for my husband and much to my surprise, I started playing it and actually got pretty good at it. I ended up playing it more than my husband after a while!"
3,2 player or Just 1 player,I owned this game last year for 2 weeks because when some friends and I wanted to play a season or get into dynasty mode it would only allow one player seasons and dynasties.. Can anyone who has this game please tell me if it is still that way or not? Thanks..Mike
1,Disappointed,"We bought this for our son for Christmas. We were all surprised when we opened what was to be a Baseball game, which he loved playing at friends houses, and instead found a Basketball game!!We will be contacting Amazon to see if this can be replaced with the item we ordered, and paid for."
1,Not awsome,"listen. usualy i enjoy most video games but there is something wrong with this one. first of all, in career mode, the only position you can paly is catcher, in home run derby, every hit is a home run, and i dont like the inside the locker room cam that they added. the graphics suck, you now have to press R1 and R2 at the same time to swing, and every game is during the night. not a best buy."
1,AWFUL!!!!,THIS IS THE WORST GAME IN THE WHOLE WORLD! IT IS COMPLETELY POINTLESS AND DULL! STUPID STUPID STUPID! EA CAN'T MAKE GAMES FOR ITS LIFE!ESPN ALL THE WAY DUDES!
4,I Deeply Enjoyed It!,This was a great game and out does a lot of other baseball games out there. It did have a challenging Franchise mode. It had great graphics and even better game play. It is enough to keep you addicted.
4,Pretty Good Game,"This game is pretty good because it has ok graphics. Also, you can make a season or you can make a spring training season. You can also design a stadium with the longest outfield in the world or with the shortest outfield in the world and lots more. You can make trades in your season, as well."
4,Where's Joe DiMaggio!,"Hi! I really enjoy playing MVP Baseball 2005. It has great graphics and great gameplay. Although, the graphics excuse me are a little ""squared like"" but I guess that will improve with technology and the next generation of PS systems coming in the near future. Above all else, the game is excellent by far but I was kind of upset with the legends roster. It has basically all of the greats legends of their time from Mickey Mantle to Babe Ruth but I was kind of upset when they didn't have Joe DiMaggio! Wasn't he one of the greatest of his time. Joe had a hitting streak of 56 which still has not been beaten till this day. I guess they missed out on ""Joe-D"" (""MVP Baseball 2005 creators!!"") but in my opinion that's all that upsets me about MVP Baseball 2005. Like I mentioned before It's an Excellent game and I would recommend this game to Everyone!Tony,From N.Y"
4,good simple design,good simple design. It does its job to get rid of all the rust. I like it. and it is easy to carry.
4,Profound and culturally relevant,"I find his writing both deep, provocative, and culturally relevant. I bought an extra copy to give to a friend seeking to make ""life decisions."" I beleive he will find it helpful, as I did.Worth reading!!!"
3,Better thought of us a series of essays than a building argument,"I read this book with a bunch of guys and it generated some good discussion on the nature of calling, vocation, and work. At times the book was frustrating because the connections between one chapter and the next were not obvious and didn't seem to build. It reads more like a collection of essays than a coherent argument, and probably works better as a slowly read devotional than a book to plough through.Still, there are some gem chapters. And though I think the book perhaps undervalues the mundane callings in life (how God relates to the day to day), Guinness does cause us to ask a lot of big picture questions (what am I called to do, how has God uniquely made me, how can my gifts best be used for the kingdom).Read it if you're thinking about what to do with your life, or if you're trying to see your work in light of your ministry."
4,A Deeper understanding of purpose,"After reading other books on purpose, and wanting to learn more about God's calling for my life, I read this book together with a friend, and found the experience quite educational, spiritually enlightening, and at times surprising.The distinction between the Corporate Calling, and the Specific Calling is a great help in understanding our purpose and how it relates to our profession.Additionally, the myths of the Catholic churches, and Protestant churches are explored, and help to explain the dissatisfaction in ""Religion"" that seems to be growing in the world.Many references to historic figures, and biblical figures make this a great read. Probably not appropriate for a seeker, but all believers should enjoy this book."
3,Good Book on the Importance of Fulfilling the Call,"This is a good, not great, book about finding your calling. If you are interested in seeking your calling, you should give this one a try. Guinness has solid theology and is a talented writer. However, this one was not one of my favorites. I found it hard to focus on this book as much of it was either basic or repetitive. There is valuable information here, but in my opinion this book did not seem to reach its full potential."
3,How To Decide,"""The Call,"" by, Os Guinness, is another one of those books which offers help to people seeking meaning and purpose to their lives. It's a fairly literate survey of historical figures caught in the same position trying to answer the question, ""who am I, and what shall I do with the life I have?"" For all his meandering through biographical examples, Guinness provides, at the end of each chapter, one simple solution, ""Listen to Jesus of Nazareth; answer his call."" While that advice is invaluable, it is neither particularly startling nor creatively insightful. Os's writing is ploddingly pedestrian--more like a survey of history textbook than a compelling, engaging book to lead one out of a wilderness of confusion into clarity of thought and earnestness of purpose. Skip the chapters and employ the recipe. There really is no shortcut, and reading about ""how-to"" is no substitute for doing: ""Listen to Jesus of Nazareth; answer His call!"""
3,A great introduction to the subject of purpose in life,"Solid stuff, but basic. Makes a good introduction to one unfamiliar with the idea that our lives need to be built around God and not around ourselves."
3,insightful,"I liked the book overall, and I thought the author had a great deal of insight into one's calling and life's work. However I did not care for the author's writing style. I felt that some salient points in the book could have been made much more clearly, and that the book could do without some of the cryptic, incomplete references to historical British figures. I think the weight of the author's argument in these cases misses the American audience in particular, as the author seems to assume a higher level of familiarity with these characters than most readers possess."
1,This book is NOT good,"I'm sure it was not his intention, but thru this book Os seems to think very highly of himself. Speaking of the background he came from, the people he knows, and even the words he uses to make him self seem smart, I found this to be very self promoting gibberish.It is a very difficult read, since he is often trying to sound smart. The examples he uses are not relatable. Whenever he thinks he is saying something life changing, he puts it in italics. Os, buddy, it wasn't life changing."
4,Predecessor to Mommie Dearest,"To me this book gives well then enough evidence that Joan was not too good of a mother. The interviewer ask her about the allegations of child abuse, even though she denies it first hand she admits that she as well as other star should not have become parents. To me that's a admission that she some things wrong with the raising of her children. This book is further proof that Joan should have never became a mom."
4,"Great cable, excellent value!",This cable was a great value at the time and I am extremely happy with the quality and construction of the cable and connectors. My only wish was that it was all white for my application. I'd highly recommend this cable.
5,Works with PS3,"I had a 35ft HDMI cable connected to a Mitsubishi HC 3800 projector that worked with a bluray player,WDTV,etc but did not work with PS3. I looked over the web and finally decided for the 10 meters Accell cable and it works perfectly with the PS3. Apparently the PS3 sends a very weak HDMI signal. Very happy now. Only thing it is very thick and it is a bit difficult to handle."
3,Louis Jordan soundtraps,"LOUIS JORDAN ON FILM contains some amazing celluloid performances, including a breathlessly-fast ""Caldonia."" This particular version (song #14) of the Jordan original clocks in at a minute and a quarter!Many of the selections featured on this set were originally ""SOUNDIES,"" a unique but short-lived video jukebox format popular in 1943-'45. Soundies circumvented wartime restrictions against new record releases by presenting musicians on brief pay-per-view movie loops.Unfortunately, a well-intentioned album concept is spoiled here by audio limitations. Some tracks have extraneous clicks while others fade abruptly. Much of this collection is midrange-only, muffled, distorted in places and somewhat unpleasant to listen to. Only recommended for Jordan fans who don't already have these takes on other albums.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 66:58"
4,Great book -an easy to understand guide to thinking about how we deal with life challenges and change!,"The book is an easy read and encourages the reader to think differently about dealing with life and changes we face. The structure of the book included tips related to each chapter and tools to help with practicing a new view. When we face a challenge or change, we often withdraw or become defensive; the book has valuable info on how to shift our thinking which can help us (and others) succeed."
4,An easy and powerful read,"The book's drawback is also its strength - it is written in such an easy and casual style that it is easy to miss the import and the importance of its underlying powerful and transforming message - life is driven much more by unstated questions than by the available answers or options. This underlying fact - that all action emanates form a noticed or unnoticed question - is very powerful realization. This is why changing the question can change the resulting action or response and hence bring about a different outcome, a different character, a different life. The book makes us aware of this fact in a subtle way and it is easy to miss this point and instead be carried away by trying to memorize the illustrated questions and apply them by rote. As with anything else - one will get out of it as much as one may be willing to put into it."
4,A new way to ask what's going on,"Marilee G. Adams found that she could generate positive changes in her behavior and productivity by changing the defensive questions that she previously asked in the face of adversity. Analyzing those protective questions showed her that she took setbacks and criticism too personally. Asking different questions enabled her to reframe each moment and create growth opportunities. Adams illustrates the problem-solving power of honest curiosity. Her ""QuestionThinking"" method generates practical ways to change your mind, literally. These are great ideas; however, their repetition within a fictional storyline may annoy some readers, while others may like this allegorical approach to telling the tale. The self-questioning techniques are easy to employ, and will help you examine situations from different points of view, which can come in quite handy. We recommend adding this set of tools to your interpersonal communication toolkit."
1,"Great for College Students, Not Helpful for those with established careers","The topic of this book is interesting, but it really offers little insight for anyone with an established career. If you're a college student with no relevant work experience, this book may provide some insight on the relevance of analytical thinking in the framework of questions. For those with any experience, the book is great for a coffee coaster."
4,Excellent,This excellent book open the eyes to a new approach in life. It is very helpful for changing your paradigm.
2,"Pretty, but not practical","As I said above: these shoes are pretty, but not practical. The space the foot goes onto is too narrow (I know it looks OK on the picture), it is almost impossible to insert the foot (and my kid has a low instep and narrow feet)."
3,DC GoGo Style,"I'm from the gogo oldschool when they used to write their own music. Being one of the newer gogo groups,Raw Image stays true to the beats but not really the gogoparty spirit. If you like thug music this is gogo 4 you. If notyou won't miss anything by passing it up. Try Experience Unlimited (EU), Chuck Brown or Rare Essence."
