2,Totally Disappointed,"I thought I had missed the opportunity to see Seger in concert - then came the ""Mystery"" tour. Great show! Classic Seger! Bought the CD on the way in and listened to it on the way home. Then one or two more times in the years since, skipping around looking for another song as good as Lock & Load. This CD is very ""unfinished"". It seems as though he had a bunch of ideas for songs that were simply made into full-length songs by use of repetition. As a die-hard Seger fan it pains me to be so honest, but no one's going to fight over this CD in divorce court!"
3,Great pics of Newfs; can do without naked men.,"I own a Newfy and can appreciate how dificult it is to photograph black dogs. So many of these pics make one smile; but the naked men are laughable. What is it I don't get here? Hardcover, family-oriented, coffee-table-type book, with these naked guys running around. How artsy?! Text is sadly lacking. For example, the section on training rescue newfs is visually exciting and has great potential, but it begs so many more questions."
3,acted too quickly,"Thought this as a DVD, but it is a CD which is rather in the vein of strange jazz, acid type jazz. You will have to like his style, nothing smooth here, rather spacelike, strange percussion, broken melodies."
2,Don't Buy Collectables Version,Once again Collectables have messed up another re-issue. The second side of Roland Kirk's Volunteered Slavery (tracks 6-10) is recorded live without pauses. On the Collectables version there are annoying 1-2 second gaps between each track. This makes the disk very hard to listen to.Buy the original Rhino/Atlantic re-issue. There are no gaps between tracks.[DW]
5,SAY A LITTLE PRAYER,"ANY TIME I LISTEN TO A RAHSAAN RECORD THAT WAS RECORDED IN THE MID TO LATE 1970'S IT ALWAYS BRINGS A SMILE TO MY FACE. HE WAS AT THE PEAK OF HIS BRILLIANCE AND ARTISTIC VISION. HIS MUSIC COMBINES SO MANY DIFFERENT, VARIED GENRES OF STYLES, AND HE PULLS IT OFF SO WELL. I SAW HIM PERFORM QUITE A FEW TIMES AND HE ALWAYS PUT ON A GREAT SHOW. THIS IS A LIVE ALBUM SO IT CAPTURES SOME OF THE URGENCY AND MASTERY OF THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS MATERIAL. THERE HAVE ALWYS BEEN A LOT OF DETRACTORS OF HIS MUSIC, SAYING THAT HE WAS ""GIMMICK"" BECUASE HE PLAYED MULTIPLE INSTRUMENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY, BUT WHAT THE NAYSAYERS FAIL TO GRASP WAS THAT THIS MAN WAS AN ORIGINAL, TRULY UNIQUE, IMPOSSIBLE TO DUPICATE. TIME HAS PROVEN THAT THEY WERE WRONG, HIS MUSIC HOLDS UP EVEN TODAY, AND I AM GLAD I HAVE THIS MAN'S MUSIC TO LISTEN TO, IT ENRICHES MY LIFE...........AND IT MAKES ME SMILE! MY FAVORITE CUT IS THE BURT BACHARACH SONG ""I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER"", IT'S KILLER!"
4,Gets the Job done,"It's a little confusing to use at first, but once you figure it out it's fine. I wanted this to prevent someone from vandalizing my gas tank, and it gets the job done."
3,good for price,"The cap works, my only complaint is that you must use the key to lock it as well as unlock it. I was thinking it would automatically lock when tightened like one I had in the past but I can deal with manually locking it."
1,Doesn't fit a 2008 Element,"I ordered this for a 2008 Honda Element and it does not fit correctly. After it is locked , it spins around without sealing and the engine emission light came on. Amazon did issue a refund for the product without any hesitation, so I give Amazon 5 stars!"
1,Wrong Part Description,"The product description says that it will fit a 2005 toyota tundra. unfortunately it does not, so i can not rate the product, but i gave it one star to bring attention to other consumers that own a toyota tundra."
4,College Textbook,"Not my favorite textbook to ever read as it is a bit dull, however very useful for the class I took."
1,Theological Text,It has been over a month since I ordered the text that I need for school and I still have not received it. Very poor service!
1,"Their ""Christian Theology"" is 'ashamed of Christ'","...and what kind of 'Christian' theology is that? BCE? CE? Gosh, don't let's go and stir up controversy by engaging in the global convention of BC/AD, you know, that 'Christ' and 'year of Our Lord' stuff, especially not in a mandatory introduction to _Christian_ theology written by, one hopes, ostensible Christians for students who are not exactly being forced to attend an ostensibly Christian college.If you teachers of Christian theology are ashamed of the whole Christ thing, then switch to sociology. For Christ's sake, eh? Do Jews shy away from saying that Jesus was not the Messiah, or Muslims from claiming that Jesus was (but) a prophet and not the Son of God?Why then must professional Christians, paid to teach Christianity, at a Christian school, shrink away from the most fundamental claim of Christianity, i.e. that Jesus is the Christ who so changed the world that time is divided into an 'after' and a 'Before' Christ?"
2,Very Disappointing!,"I like Carol Deacon's designs but was very disappointed with this book because a lot of the designs were repeats from other Carol Deacon books that I already had. In fact, I bought two (2) new books by Carol Deacon and found the books to be over half-filled with repeat designs from other books by this author.If you are looking for new cake design ideas like I was and already have book/s by this author, do not bother to buy this book - try someone else."
3,Party Cakes,Party cakes were good and the kids loved them I have nothing more to say so don't tell me I have to write eleven more words or I will start using words you don't want to read
5,Word 2002 - an upgrade worth having,"Probably the nicest feature bundled into this upgrade is the speech recognition tool. Once ""trained"", this tool allows fast and reasonably accurate document entry. Whether you need to collect tomes of information for research projects or just need a quick mechanism to collect your thoughts, Word 2002 handles the task and continues to be the most user-friendly wp product on the market."
2,More is worse,"Every time Microsoft dinks with Word and creates a new version, their geniuses take out or modify features users have come to depend on. Thus Word becomes less user friendly and more cantankerous.After trying Word 2002, our office is switching to FrameMaker 7.0. The learning curve was much gentler than we expected, and the power to create simple documents and complicated tech manuals that number correctly is beyond price. The new version of Word finally forced us to change and we'll never look back."
2,Marketing-driven update--just get OpenOffice.org/StarOffice,"I've used Word on and off since 1991, and have in the last several years (when the job market permitted) used required use of Word as a screen for writing jobs I wouldn't apply for. It was great in 1995 and has bloated horribly since then. OK, not a terrible product, but not fabulous, and this upgrade's just another way to get a few more bucks out of us for no particular reason, without enough improvements.What's your alternative? Not getting it. You don't actually need Word to make or read Word files. Download OpenOffice.org for free or StarOffice on this site, and use its word processor to read and create Word format files, if you need to.If you still want this Word upgrade, well, then you must love it more than I do. :)"
2,Not Quite Ready for Prime Time,"I wouldn't rush right out and buy this upgrade. I'm running it on a brand new very snappy Dell workstation with XP and buckets of RAM and it crashes on a regular basis, as in several times a day. And upon crashing it goes through a confusing routine in which it apparently tries to save changes to the default normal.dot template, which is going to drive people who don't even know what the normal.dot template is crazy. Yes, there are some nice enhancements here, but the overall experience reminds me of running Word97 on Windows 95 -- ""Save your work!"""
2,Anything but soft!,"I thought by the description of this blanket it would be very soft and have the feel of cashmere, it is anything but soft and has the feel of rope or twine. This blanket is very ""scratchy"" especially around the edges. Amazon really does give a false review of this blanket by saying ""so sumptuous and rich""."
2,iMusic,I did an IQ test before and after using Volume 1 and my IQ score did not change. Everything else in my life remained relatively constant.
3,review for Rumble Fish and The Outsiders,"I was happy with the actual products themselves however I was extremely dissappointed with the service because I ordered both dvds from the same place at the same time and was charged two seperate postages, I will not be purchasing from 'inetvideo'again."
1,"Sorry, An Awful Film","I had seen on IMDb this film had a 7 average rating and I am a big Outsiders fan. Unfortunately, in my opinion, this is an awful film."
3,I really don't know what to say.,"I watched this movie today, and I really don't know what to say about it. The acting was pretty good and the beginning was really great but, I dunno. This movie ends up going nowhere, and as much as I'd like to say that I liked this movie, I just can't. I was very bored watching this movie, but I kept watching hoping it would get better. At the end I thought, well, it was ok and it could have been better. But I must say that the camerawork in this movie was amazing. A lot of closeups and a lot of the views were just breathtaking. If you're into good camerawork, check this one out."
4,Rumble Fish,The book was excellent and so was the movie. I wish I could just watch it over and over again.
2,Bad language ruined in good story,The vulgar/obscene language added to the script by the producers spoiled what would have been a good movie for young teens. Such language is not in the book authored by mister Hinton.
1,give me a break...,im sure ill here alot from this review but everyone giving this movie 5 stars i dont see how or why.have you people just been introduced to the movie world?this movie is awful between the bad acting and the annoying music playing during talking scenes its flat out frustrating.rusty james brother in this movie acts like a mental case for you peole that havent seen this he dies in the end (i just saved you an hour and a half of your life cause now you wont have to waste it on this crappy movie).between the bad music the bad acting and the plot/storyline going all over the place in this movie its seriously like being on a bad acid trip.what a waste of money and time on this one.ill donate mine to goodwill or the garbage can..not worthy of my movie collection.
3,Good Story,"the movie was good. it was done by the same author and director of the outsiders, so it has that kind of feel. there were parts that were kind of lame, but seeing an early movie for these actores starting out was fun, so it helped carry the movie."
3,"Lovely art, so-so movie","The plot and the action take a backseat to things like set design, photography, choreography and the Stewart Copeland soundtrack in this FF Coppola 1983 film version of an SE Hinton novel. Only the rumble fish are in color. I dug seeing the young and unmolested Mickey Rourke, and even Tom Waits was still young and groovy here. Nicholas Cage made his film debut, as well. The story line is some nonsense about how a younger brother can't live up to his older brother's ways. Dennis Hopper plays the alcoholic dad. Filmed in Tulsa two weeks after ""The Outsiders,"" the better film of the two, this one is a fine b&w art film, but less than scintillating as a movie."
4,Rumble Fish,I really enjoyed the book Rumble Fish. One of the reasons i enjoyed Rumble Fish was because it was action packed. I like gang stories and Fights and stuff. If you like to be into books then Rumble Fish is the book for you. It shows the life of a thug bad and good sides. I'm not much of a book reader myself but Rumble Fish made me read this book form beginning to end. I recommend this book to all people.-KF
3,Not suitable for middle school students,"As an 8th grade teacher, I had my class read Rumble Fish by S.E. Hinton. I was very excited to buy the movie and have my students compare and contrast the book to the movie. I previewed the movie before showing the students. Great movie, but way inappriopriate for students to view. It is rated R for massive F-bombs and nudity. S.E. Hinton is known for young adult literature, I just wish that the movie makers would have toned down the excessive language and nudity to make the movie appriopriate for young adult students."
5,"Personal favorite,great 80's flick stands test of time.","R.I.P Dennis.Francis did a great job visually capturing Hinton's novel.Copeland,Ridgeway unforgettable Box me in.Mickey and Matt nailed their roles.Mickey's like the 80's James Dean or young Brando.Dennis' best work since Francis' Apocalypse Now.Not a big role but defintely memorable.Maybe Rumble Fish will make it to blu-ray.I wont be surprised if it doesn't.It sure would beat half the crap they are porting to Blu-ray."
3,Disappointed,After reading the Outsiders I had high expectations for this book. I found it be to a quick and easy read but with no real plot.
2,Hard to follow,"I read this book years ago and remember liking it well enough, but over time I have forgotten the storyline. All I remembered was the Motorcycle Boy and it seems like the character they chose to play the role was perfect to how I pictured him. But I have to admit that I just couldn't follow the story. I didn't remember enough of it and it seems like you needed to have read the book to have a good idea of what was going on."
1,"A very juvenile, ill informed and unprofessional approach","Having met several vulnerable people that this author has manipulated into paying for repeated expensive therapy sessions, I read the book which confirmed her unorthodox, unhelpful approach. ""It's not at all you, everyone else is a jerk"" is her approach, which keeps vulnerable clients paying her but does not help those clients understand themselves least at all learn to improve themselves as a therapist should.Go on Google and look at the number of talk shows, radio spots, and speaking engagements this author has made pushing this book for sale. That tells you everything you need to know about this author."
2,Not department store,"OK, love love Laura Mercier foundation, however, this blend is off. I actually looked at LM site to compare bottles since I believed it was not authentic, different made in locations??? Not saying but check your formula before you order., The oil free blush ivory I received is sooo much sheerer than my department store purchase. Best to try it on. I'll stick to department stores for my foundation & spend the extra 5-10 bucks."
4,Une bonne vision généraliste du hacking,"Les auteurs sont tous des intervenants reconnus dans le monde du hackings, et on comprend bien à la lecture de leur livre que la disponibilité et la facilité d'utilisation des outils de piratage ne fait qu'amplifier la menance d'attaques de toutes sortes.A lire en complément : le Guide du Cyberdétective, de Alain STEVENS, paru aux Editions Chiron, ISBN 2702707831."
4,GO FOR IT,"For the price these are great. The only reason they did not get 5 stars is the hem is uneven on one side. The colors are beautiful. The gold is a very dark, rich color that matched perfectly. The colors shown, are true on the site. If you are looking for just a hint of color, go with the ivory. They too are beautiful. Very happy with them."
3,Not as bad as they say.,"Chimeras isn't as bad as they say. In fact it's not really bad for a piece of new music that neither contains anything I would consider ""new"" nor anything most would consider ""music."""
4,Brian Regan is so funny!,"This CD is fun for the whole family - Brian Regan is a clean comic, which is a nice change from others. My preteens enjoy his humor, and I don't have to worry about censoring bad words. His funny takes on simple situations in life are something everyone can relate to."
5,take luck,this cd is excellent. i love brian regan so much that me and 8 friends of mine got brian regan related tattoos. TAKE LUCK!
5,HAHAHA!,"This is one great comedy CD. I was able to relate to a few things, which made it all the more funnier. Brian Regan is definitely one of the better comics out there today (and has been for years). If there is 1 downside to this CD, its that you cant see the visuals that he expertly provides on film... but dont think you wont get your money's worth."
5,One funny guy. . . .,"Great CD. Great comedian! Give Brian until about the third track and you'll belaughing non-stop from there on. The great thing about Brian is that his jokes areclean and his language is extremely mild, however he does use ""hell"" several times.This is a ""must hear""!"
5,Awesome,"Just plain funny. We've listened to it at least 10 times through over the years and its always hilarious. If you think he's ruining comedy then you are disagreeing with Marc Maron, Patton Oswalt, and Bill Hicks. He has an awesome interview on Marc Maron's WTF Podcast. Check that out too and find out WHY he tends to be a clean comic."
3,Enjoyed however...,This guy is funny and does some very funny takes on things like people in the background during filming of Antique Road Show; but (to be expected I guess) it's funny off and on. I'd received such as big build-up about how funny this guy is and although he's funny; he's not Bill Cosby-like funny consistently.
5,Very Funny and CLEAN,"If you're turned off by most comedians because their humor is off-color, you'll love Brian Regan. He is SO funny but he's not gross. My husband brought this home and I didn't want to bother listening to it but I'm hooked! I was laughing so hard . . .I wish amazon would carry his DVD because it's even funnier when you can see the facial expressions.Great DVD and this makes a GREAT gift."
5,"Absolutely the funniest ""no need to censor"" new comic!","His fresh perspective of real life events will leave you laughing harder than you thought you could. You will feel compelled to share him with your freinds, because you won't be able to keep from quoting his humor! I'd give it 6 stars if I could!"
5,Hilarious!,"Brian Regan has to be the funniest comic I have ever seen, the laughs-per-minute ratio is so intensely high you should make sure not to be drinking anything while listening to this album."
3,Brian Regan,"I had been told about Brian Regan from a friend. A good clean comic. I had this on my wish list and got it as a gift. Sorry, I wasn't impressed with him as a comic. His humor is just not mine. He is clean though. If you already know him and like his stuff, I am sure this CD would be fine. Just not my style. I guess I am more Andy Griffith and Bob NewHart."
4,"CD or not CD, that is the question",VERY FUNNY!!! The only way to make this better is to have seen the outrageous expressions he can create on his face.
5,Good clean fun,"This is a great CD, with lots of funny, funny material. And for all you PTC Parents-in-Training, Regan works totally clean, while losing nothing in his comedy. A must buy, but not for anyone who has a car CD player. You just may spin off the road from laughing so hard."
5,Certain Side-Splittuh,I've seen him 6 times and listened to his CD 60 times and EACH time I get cramps from laughing. It's a great ab workout! The general impression that his ability to make his audience laugh at things without using profanity might make some people think that he's lame - BUT THIS MAN COULD HAVE MADE STALIN (...) HIS PANTS. Sam Kinneson (may he rest in peace) wishes he was this talented. I dare anyone to combat his degree of humor. That he's cute is just a bonus.
4,Brian Regan Live,"This cd is pretty good but not amazing. If you want something you can play with your children or grandparents then this is for you. Personally I find Pablo Fransisco more talented. Regan is not as funny as other comics. If you only have enough money for one cd I would recomend Mitch Hedberg, Dane Cook, Steven Wright, Robert Klein or even Austin Peterson."
1,Comedy?,"I hope this wasn't meant to be in the comedy. That's what I purchased it for, and was VERY disappointed. This CD was very stupid, and not funny at all. I thought one of the ideas of comedy was to bring out the ridiculousness in society. I guess he tried doing that, but failed in my opinion.Waste of money!!!"
5,Laugh till you pee!!!!,"How long has it been since you laughed until your bladder could no longer contain itself? Well, if you have to think about it, then it has been too long. Buy this CD and remember. Brian Regan is the funniest man to walk the planet since Robin Williams. BUY IT NOW!"
5,Great comedian CD,Brian Regan Live is a great audio CD. Product received in a timely manner and just as advertised. I laughed my head off listening to it.
5,Regan ROCKS,This guy is great! We were introduced to his comedy by a friend that played his recent DVD at a party. Our family was instantly hooked. We bought his CD that was released years earlier and took it on a road trip to Las Vegas this summer. We had to have listened to that CD 5 times during the drive out and had loads of laughs every time. The first track is the best and sets the tone for the rest of the CD. Buy it and enjoy it!!!!!
5,*** Regan Funny - Me Laugh ! :-),"Brian Regan is the funniest, cleanist comic I've ever encountered. I have been to see him live at the Improv in Dallas, TX many, many times and each time I bring friends. I've listened to this CD many, many times - in fact, I have 2 copies just to ensure I can listen to it whenever I want. I highly recommend this album..."
5,Brian Regan Live,"My 11 yr old daughter listen to this with her cousins over and over on a long car ride. Could recite almost the whole thing. Family friendly, entertainment."
4,Pretty funny,Good CD for Brian Regan fans. The YouTube clips show his funniest bits. It's nice to see him in person on the PC or on a DVD. He is a funny guy.
4,Uninhibited Monk/Coltrane brilliance,"Forget the poor quality recording, just listen to the music. This live concert shows Monk and Coltrane totall uninhibited, free to impose their visions onto the canvas of the music. Coltrane's solos are amazing, especially on 'I mean you'. There's also, among other things, a short and snappy version of 'Epistrophy.'"
5,This Book is Fantastic!,"I thought I knew, of knew of, just about every important American poet now being published, but in reading these poems by Glenn Logan I was amazed that I had never heard of him before. Apparently he just wrote for himself for forty years or so, and then just unleashed this book on the public, without any hoopala or big-time promotion of any sort. But the QUALITY of the poems is outstanding! Some of them made me cry, others made me laugh out loud, but most just made me smile, and to think! It is gratifying to know that not all the great American poems had already written. Logan has added quite a few!"
4,A poet to be reckoned with,"Glenn Logan is a versatile poet. Those who admire a poet's talent will do well to partake of the feast presented in this collection of 125 poems. They are vignettes that delight the eye and tickle the brain. These ample and colorful images of people, places, animals, and other things, are pure entertainment and often thought-provoking. They deliciously carry the reader through life and time. Even ""life"" and ""time"" are themes presented, albeit brief, but magically capturing the essence of each."
4,chronology of cliffy,ward being 1of top4 highest songwriters this cd must be included in any serious music room rare stuff & perfect interpretation
4,great resource,Hans Baer's book is still a unique contribution to an understudied phenomenon. Black spiritualism has links with the experience of African American Muslims and syncretist groups; this work provides a helpful resource in understanding current movements.
4,Richard Jeni is a very funny man,"Richard Jeni is one of the funniest comedians you will ever hear and this CD has a nice collection of his bits. He can be quite crude but also very smart. His mastery of words is on par with George Carlin. Favorite parts on this CD would be ""Women Smoke Cigars?"", ""Fred Robster"", ""Women: They Came from a Drying Planet"" and ""Cooking with Bill""."
4,Laughed my A$$ off,"I saw the HBO special when it aired in 1996. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. I reccomend this CD highly. The ""Love Songs"" bit he does is hysterical--I laughed my way into getting a ""6-pack"" from constant laughter...Ha, I'm laughing right now as I recall it--GREAT !!!"
5,SOUNDS FOR SORE EARS - BEST MUSIC IN A WHILE,"I saw Wilco in a bar in Pittsburgh just after their first album came out.Took my teenage kids, might've been their first rock show. Wehigh-fived the guys after the show as they were going downstairs to the dressing room. They've come a long, long, way.The tunes have really expanded - sometimes I don;t know what Mr. Tweedy is trying to say, but the way he writes tickles me like no one has in the last twenty years or so.The new lead guitarist is THE INCARNATION OF JOHN CIPOLLINA (RIP - from Quicksilver MEssenger Service of long ago). Nels, you are the MAN! The guitar work and melodies on this album defy description. The bass playing is PERSIAN RUG! The drummer is CONCRETE SOLID. The keys add PECAN PIE & WHIPPED CREAM. I know you fellas won;t make another like this, but WILCO, you're in a great groove here. Folks, buy the recording with the DVD, it's a great look inside the band as they run through some tunes in their practice pad. WOWSA!"
5,good the first listen better every time,"this is a great album. admitedly, I had very little Wilco in my music vocabulary to begin with. i had heard a few songs here and there and had a few songs in compilation cd's, but i kind of knew I would like them. I was not dissapointed. Kind of a greatful dead sounding folk / roots sound. I got the copy with the dvd. the dvd is cool with the interviews and live performances in the band's studio. kind of get the feel of hanging out with them. *****"
4,Brian Piccolo,"This book was largely like the movie ""Brian's Song"" about Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers. Brian and Glae compete for the same position on a pro football team, then Gale gets the position. Well, along the way Gale gets hurt and discouraged, but while he is filling in for Gale, Brian helps him recover and come back to his position on the team. When Gale comes back, he gets back his old position, but Brian also starts at another one he is very successful at...Until one day. Brian becomes ill, and they discover that he has cancer. Gals stands by his friend the way his friend stood by him. It is a moving and real story."
5,A must read for serious business leaders,"Outstanding! There are four facts that make your book a must read for serious business leaders: 1. The number one challenge facing business leaders today is finding and keeping quality employees. 2. Growing and developing people will be the key competitive advantage of the 21st century organization. 3. People are the only ""non-replicable"" differentiators in a highly competitive business environment. and 4. Information and technology have become the great equalizers - both have dramatically reduced the time required for innovation and business barriers to entry"
1,This (fluff) book (fluff) seems (fluff) to (fluff) be,"a (fluff) good (fluff) book. It (fluff) took (fluff) a (fluff) long (lots of extra fluff) time (fluff) to (fluff) read (repeated fluff) it. I felt many of the points could have been made with less re-iteration of the same underlying theme, over and over and over and over and over (you get my point). They moral of the book is: ""treat your employees as how you would want to be treated"" and they simply listed exmples of all the different things you could do."
3,Cute!,"Dare Wright, The Kitten's Little Boy (Four Winds, 1971)My wife looked this one over when I brought it home. When she was finished, she seemed profoundly disturbed. This is why I always hide the Lonely Doll books when I bring them home, I guess, because that way lies madness.This one's cute, actually, with lots of pictures of baby kittens. Our hero meets a little boy, and the two immediately like one another. The kitten's mother is not at all happy about this, because she doesn't see where a kitten should be in any way subservient to a human, and tells him why. He then comes up with an inventive way to both placate his mother and indulge in his friendship with the boy.There's the potential to read all kinds of weird subtext into this tale. Which is pretty much a given for any book by Dare Wright. But, that said, the kitten's a lot cuter than the doll. ***"
3,pretty cheesy plastic strip,don't get me wrong once loaded they work. the strip is white and the nails dont' sit snug but slightly loose. gotta fiddle with the things almost every time. bummer.
2,Another Indy - Getting tiresome!,"This movie needed a less-than-ecstatic review. It gave me the thoughts:""Was this film really necessary?Was I just taken for a chump after, once again, purchasing an 'okay' movie that would have been better to rent from Red Box or check out from the library?Is this Indy film practically a parody of itself, what with the unattractive(except for the delicious young Olivia Crocicchia) characters and the lilting piano score and the many wasted minutes?""If a person is in the right kind of funk, this film might cheer them up, I can imagine that.John C. Reilly practically saved it for me with his likeable character.Not for buying, this dvd!!It needs at least one two-star review to offer a more realistic or honest impression. If I were feeling truly critical it would have received one star. I should be angry for wasting my hard-earned money."
3,Never quite got around to telling a story,"Alright. So. I liked the movie. I liked the performances. There are many very effective and affecting scenes. Still, it left me unsatisfied. The sequence of events never quite got around to being a story."
2,"STARTS WITH GREAT PROMISE, BUT...","The ""i"" in the spelling of the title character should give you fair warning 0of the pretentious aspirations of this comic infused coming of age drama that should have - could have - been a sleeper. The first half of the story (and film) really works. The sad/funny relationship of the depressed, pajama clad student (Jacob Wysocki) and the well-meaning vice principal and counselor (a spot on John C. Reilly) is full of promise, but that thread unravels with a longish, sexual coming of age sequence that seems forced and motivated only by an attempt at politically correctness. The movie never gets back on track and all the things that were set up are never satisfactorily actualized. I wanted to like this so much and felt betrayed. Not a good feeling. Azazal Jacobs directs with uncertainty about what story he wants to tell."
3,High Expectations.,"I probably would have rated it higher had I not seen it on a couple of ""Best of the year"" lists. I went in expecting to be a slightly better experience. Good film. Not great. Lead role is very good."
3,Nice changes to a great spreadsheet program,"Smart tags can be more annoying than anything else, however can be disabled. Handy though, is their ability to detect errors in formulas, and find the otherwise impossible to find mistake in a large speadsheet. Also cool is ""border painting"" feature.Many things stay the same as 2000, though. I'm not sure that the very expensive upgrade is worth it, and you can no longer upgrade from Works, or from a standalone program (e.g. Word), but rather from an Office Suite ONLY. Be careful when ordering just the upgrade!"
2,My Review On Excel 2002,"I belive that excel on a whole is a well made item and deserves a lot of credit, but i also believe that when i bought Microsoft Excel 98 i could have just updated it over the internet every time there was an addition was available! There is no need now-a-days to keep putting the same software on disks and selling it off at extortionate prices, plus it probably has some kind of monitoring software in it as well, most Microsft items do. These are the reasons that i have given it a 2 star... it has extremely good potential but it is to expensive and to overrated for its price."
4,An Important Book,"This little book is short and sweet like all of Leonard Koren's explorations of human potential. It tracks the mind set of thoughtful people who can take a flower shop seriously because their society does not impose the cost of health care and the cost of employee retirement upon an entrepreneur who would open a flower shop. This is a profound point, one made to me personally by the author. Sadly, Leonard Koren does not dwell on this reality in his wonderful book. To have done so would have made it an immediate classic. Perhaps Koren will expound on this BRILLIANT OBSERVATION OF HIS in a new edition, as a forward, an afterword, or a few sentences somewhere in the otherwise engaging text. I will likely read this book again because the author has inspired me to set a murder mystery in a flower shop. I would certainly give this book as a gift."
4,Useful in History Class,"I have purchased several DVDs in the ""History of Warfare"" series, including this one on the Vikings. I find them informative and appealing to students in my classes at a classical school, where I have used this one as background for a study of *Asser's Life of Alfred the Great* with advanced eighth-graders. There are re-enactments of Viking invasions as well as maps showing Norse routes to England, Ireland, France, the eastern Mediterranean, and even the northeastern coast of the American continent. While discussing the Viking world view, the video does a good job of explaining Valhalla, an after-life that looks a bit like Dante's vision of hell, it turns out. I do wish the video contained more information about the building of the Viking ships, but, all in all, I found it useful for my purposes."
3,Viking wars,"Although the facts are all there, and no doubt true, the film itself could have been done much better. There was much repetitive use of the same pieces of film, often said to be depicting different people/events each time. The music didn't always 'fit' either, as evidenced mostly by the last scene, I felt."
3,"An ""accessible"" marriage book","I like how this book puts the (sometimes) complex man-woman relationship into a language that most can understand. I will say that it's written with a slant toward the ""men are oafs by nature"" mentality. But nowadays, it seems that this is the way most men in our culture are! Chuck Snyder hits on some strange truths that plague male-female relationships, but just when you're expecting a solution to these dilemmas, the chapter ends without one. I think his main goal was to help people understand that men and women think and relate differently, and he's done that.It's a good book for husbands who refuse to get any help at all with their failing marriage. I hope readers understand that not all men are as ""oafish"" as portrayed by the author, and that not all women are as unbending as portrayed by his wife. :)"
2,"Good Locations, Bad Information","This book is good for finding locations in AZ that are visit able. Perfect if you're a novice ghost hunter or just someone who likes to go check out haunted locations without wanting too much history behind the hauntings.The stories are jumpy. Not really giving the full history behind the hauntings. They talk about what their team witnessed, which is again all over the place. Also mixed in are stories from other witnesses. The stories don't really flow well and the information is hearsay at best.I would suggest using the book to find the locations (if you don't already know them yourself), then doing your own investigation."
5,Praise for Sacred Geometry,"Sacred Geometry was a text for the New Chartres School sponsored by Wisdom University in Chartres, France July 3-9.The book illuminated most of the geometrically related information which we experienced hands-on in our class withRichard Henry, British Geometrist. Richard led in making multi-dimensional shapes from point to dodecahydron andbeyond! These forms were described and attributed historically, illustrated and defined for construction in thebook which is comprehensive for understanding, making and looking at geometry relationally. It is an essentialasset in the study of Geometry. I love this book and will share it with friends new to its information.Lynne Z"

5,Dan Pico Knows How to Make Great Movies On Any Budget,"The images are beautiful. Well lit. In focus. You can hear every word of the well written dialogue. (Dan also wrote the script.) If Hollywood knew they could get movies made this well for such little money, they'd never approve any budget over a million dollars. Most indie films are slow and the dialogue is ok at best. Dan writes wonderful scripts - creative, surprising, interesting, and yet they also touch the core of humanity. The man was born to make films. He knows how to suck in an audience and keep it there. I can't wait to be in a Dan J. Pico production!"
3,Batman SHOULD be black!,"I always thought Batman should be black...perfectly honed physical and mental rigor, in response to/recovery from urban crime that destroyed a family...That's what's required of urban black males in the real world far too often, yet everyday. Stan Lee takes Batman right where he should be.Story? Meh. Costume? Double Meh.But the context in which we inhabit the Batman mythos is much more credible, to me, than an inherited billionaire's woe. And I like the typical Batman (Frank Miller's adaptation, anyway)...its just that with this offering Stan Lee has actualized thoughts about the character that I've always had...resultantly, it's worth a look."
2,I would think twice before buying,"I bought this book thinking that Stan Lee would be re-creating Batman with some spark so you could go WOW but once you have read it was more like OH the story as to how he became Batman was crap, the Batman costume was disgusting there was just nothing that I liked about it, I was very disapointed with it, I would really think twice before buying this book. I hope that I have helped you."
5,High Quality Print Image & Paper,"I wanted to write a review on this product after I decided to try another well-known brand of DVD Case Inserts. The print quality and paper of this insert is super high quality and I would recommend it to anyone. If you are looking for ""photo quality"" print image, these are the ones to buy. They are the same price as the ""Name Brand"" ones."
4,A good English detective story,"I enjoy English detective stories and this one was good, although it took a long time to get into what was going to happen. Worth persevering. Have read another by same author and hope there will be many more."
5,make you say,this is kevin eagleton and i can for shure tell you this film can and will make you say god damn.
1,What is the deal with the high ratings?,"This film is a piece of garbage. The storyline is mundane, the characterizations are weak, and the acting is almost non-existant. I figured with such a great cast and director that this film would be great. WRONG! Richard Linklater's earlier films (especially ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Before Sunrise"") impressed me immensely. Do not rent or purchase this movie, and if it comes on cable change the channel. It can induce narcolepsy (instant sleep) and possibly brain damage (it will at least make you feel dumber for spending $3 to rent it)."
1,Awful - I was hoping they would all get killed!,"I never write reviews, despite the fact that I see about 200 movies/year. However, the high rating here just shocked me into a response. I walked out of this movie after an unbearable hour. The acting is bad. The plot is underdeveloped. The characters are not the least bit sympathetic. Awful!"
4,"A little slow at times, but overall a very good movie","It's hard to make a successful movie based upon real people and true situations. But this movie does an admirable job of it. I'd forgotten all about the Newton Boys until I saw this movie recently (just loved the interviews played during the credits, definitely added to the entire movie). Very good acting by all key players. Loved the music from that era."
5,winter games a music masterpiece!,"I have performed on keyboards many contemporary artists' work and ""Winter Games"" is an exeptional composition which powerfully evokes the title with its fanfare beginning and then the lilting melody line and ending as it begins on a strong conclusion. I never tire of playing it or listening to it. Move over Andrew Lloyd Webber!!"
3,a long read!,"I was intrigued by the cover description, and I did enjoy many things about this book. I liked the way Gibbons wrote different view points of different races, and how he realistically portrayed the running away of Reuben and Martha-it was not a sugar-coated adventure. Their love had it's ups and downs. However I did not like the ending because I personally like neat and tidy endings (even though those are unrealistic!), this ending was too abrupt, and nothing else was written about what happened to Martha and their children."
5,Some of the Best Recordings Ever Made!,"If you are a fan of Sinatra's music, this collection is well worth the price. You will not be disappointed; this collection is a musical masterpiece. With arrangements from Nelson Riddle and Billy May, Sinatra's voice has never been better.These albums represent what have been referred to as the first ""concept albums"". Rather than a miscellaneous collection of songs, the albums have been carefully constructed to set a certain ""mood"". The collection consists of upbeat ""swing"" albums as well as records featuring the ballad or, in the words of the Chairman, the ""saloon"" songs. A Christmas album as well as an instrumental album is also featured in this set.If you seriously love ""the Voice"", you'll love this collection."
1,Waste of money and time,"Waste of money. And more problem than it is worth. It also eats up batteries like you would not believe. Your batteries will get 3 hours running time MAX on this player, and I mean even using high powered batteries catered towards digital devices.Do not buy this unit."
1,out dated,"don't get it. it is out dated. has some basic common sense stuff, but rules are out dated and lots of the mechanics of the new trailers are bad."
1,do not purcchase,"THey show three tubes, you only receive one. So for $6.00 it is not worth it. Tried to contact company with on results."
4,great tubes that survived the lazy river in vegas,"I recently stayed at the Mandalay Bay in Vegas and my partner and I needed tubes for the lazy river at there. The hotel charges $25.00 for comparable tubes (ok, maybe the hotel's tubes are a little bit bigger and have handles, but that isn't worth 5x the price). These tubes lasted 4 days. We didn't bring them home. But they far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the money."
5,Fun and Bright,Great for the price! Holds up very well. It fun for the kids and I love the bright orange color. It is perfectly sized for a child.
3,Ripped inner tube!,We received the tubes about 5 days after I ordered it with prime. These need extra time to be prepared so be aware of that. I ordered five of them for a donut costume design for my coworkers and I. One of the tubes we received was ripped so it wouldn't inflate. Otherwise these tubes are pretty nice for whatever occasion you plan to use them.
1,Total waste,"Note that this product only includs one ring, not 3 as is pictured. At the time of my purchase, the price was about triple what other retailers were selling for, but since they pictured 3 rings (which is the number of tubes I needed), it seemed rational. I felt deceived when I only received one.Then, within the first hour of use by my daughter, a seam in the tube broke. Now I need to replace it again. This purchase was a total waste. Would strongly recommend *NOT* buying this product."
5,Good size for an adult,"Pretty colors!! (design printed on clear plastic on the top half and a solid color on the bottom half)-- except that when you buy, you can't choose which color you get of the three that are offered; consequently i have 2 orange ones and one green one. I'd love to have one of each color. They are tough and beautifully designed. One more thing: they're easy to inflate, but take some patience to deflate."
3,Where's Dolley?,"This book is an excellent work for anyone who wishes to study Jamea Madison's mind. It provides incredible detail into what his thinking was on any particular topic of interest to him.. Unfortunately, I was looking for a biography of him to tell me about his life, his family, etc. Although the book did mention that he was married, I don't believe it even referred to his wife, Dolley, by name."
1,too much citing,"I found this book horribly written. For any amazing president who helped to mold our nation, this author certainly did not portray Madison this way. I've read a number of books about other historical figure that all managed to capture the time and person, but this one did not. The only people who will probably pore over this book with slight interest will be the students that have assigned for class."
4,Classic From Black Belt Theater Days...,"Ok a few things first.This is a Hong Kong production so think Shaw Brothers / Kung Fu Theater stuff. Secondly this is a Lo Wei film, he's the guy who made Bruce Lee's first two films crappier than they needed to be.With that understood, this is a lot of fun. Chuck Norris is a bad guy with typical Kung Fu Theater dubbing.Unlike most ""pretty bad"" Kung Fu films, Chuck manages to show some technique and polish, enough that his spinning back kick combo was clipped along with Heroes of the East and 5 Deadly Venoms for the intro for Black Belt Theater."
2,Don't Expect Chuck to be the Super Hero this One,"This is a Hong Kong-made film, starring an actor named Don Wong as a Chinese-American cop in San Francisco (one of the other titles is ""Slaughter in San Francisco"") who is, of course, highly skilled in the martial arts. He is propositioned by crime boss Chuck Norris (in his second and final villainous role) to work for him as an enforcer. When Wong refuses, the trouble begins. The fight scenes are not the calibur of Norris, Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan, with the exception of the final duel between Norris and Wong. Chuck Norris fans should see. Others needn't bother. Also known as ""Yellow Faced Tiger."" God knows how many other labels have been taped onto this one."
4,A well needed view into the life of a counter culture hero.,"Let's face it, alot is writen about Neal, but not much by Neal himself.This book of letters to his wife while in prison is a welcome look into a deep side of a man who didn't leave us with enough of his thoughts on paper."
3,No educational value,"I purchased this for my 3 year old son. He already has many other programs that he loves and can play very well. This program is OK, but has no real educational value. Also, he doesn't like it at all. We haven't played it in months."
3,A little too sexist,"I liked this book for many of the reasons already stated in other reviews so I won't bother mentioning them.I disagree with those that say the book should have mentioned things like - should they combine bank accounts etc. Since when do romances include those matters? And really, it would be boring reading anyway.What bothered me about the book though was that the hero used his 'rights' as a husband to send his wife away to another country when her ex-boyfriend came to town.I found that very unbelievable. The book was written in the 1980s not the 1780s! Any modern, professional woman (as the heroine was portrayed as being) would have told him to get stuffed and never have boarded the plane.Due to such controlling behaviour, it would have been more believable for the heroine to leave the hero instead."
3,I expected more.,"I've never read Jayne Ann Krentz before but had long heard how scintillating her stories were. I was expecting that amount of heat here and as a result, I ended up feeling let down.The whole premise of the book seemed kind of silly, the drama wasn't very dramatic and even the love scenes didn't set the pages on fire. This book definitely should have been more. Don't get me wrong. I actually liked Gray and Amber as a couple and I liked their playful banter. Still, something was missing (excitement? realism?).Despite this, I'd give the author another try. As for this book, three stars for the S.U.T. humor. Did anyone else figure out right away who Honoria Tyler Abercrombie really was? Anyway, that was the best part of ""Between The Lines."" ;-)"
3,couldn't get past the premise,"Cormick Grayson has fallen in love with his assistant Amber Langley, but he knows she's sworn off relationships--passionate ones, anyway--so he proposes a marriage of convenience, thinking he can bring her around.When it's plausible, I really enjoy the marriage of convenience plot device. But this one wasn't really plausible. The overt reasoning seemed to be more ""why not?"" and Gray's private reasoning was insultingly patronizing: he wanted to be ""in possession"" when Amber's sexuality reawakened.Ignoring the premise, the budding relationship between the two was fun to read--going from friendly boss and employee to lovers, with lots of friendly banter, much of it centering on the truly bad western poet Gray studies as a hobby.There were some fun lines, some romantic and even poignant scenes, but I just couldn't get past the premise and the paternalism."
5,Prime Krentz,"As a long time Krentz fan I have always found this book to be a favorite re-read. The heroine and hero are wonderful--the story of sleeping beauty is always a favorite and this heroine is definitely emotionally in deep slumber. But, what really sets this story apart is Jayne's terrific invention of the western poet Twitchell. The bad poetry is hilarious and yet just enough ""off"" to mimic real western poetry from the likes of Bad Bart and other 49er era poets.The denouement with the cheating ex-boy friend getting the fright of his life is hilarious--a fun book that is high on my comfort shelf."
4,Cute,"Cute book - the bad poetry makes me giggle and the relationship between the two leads is very sweet. None one of JAK's greatest, but definitely very enjoyable nonetheless."
5,"A Book for All Seasons, HOUNDED by Clifford Neal","I never thought I would read about -- and enjoy so much -- the lives of criminals and how they think and act. This book has something for everyone. This true story lets us all know that ""history does repeat itself"" and it sometimes takes a very long time to ""learn from our mistakes"" if, indeed, we ever do. Just knowing that God never gives up on us is very comforting to know. I loved the way Clifford used the e-mail account of telling this story and wove his own story into it so well. And incorporating the Rules of Prison into the story was eye-opening. If only people who are considering breaking the law (however small) could read this book, it could - and would - make a difference for them. Thank you, Clifford, for making this story so real and public."
2,"More a writer, less a mother","I am all for expressing the dark side of motherhood--it can certainly be the worst of times. But it is also the best. That's why reading Rachel Cusk's book, A Life's Work, was distressing to me, to say the least....But to present the dark without the bright is to do motherhood an injustice. There certainly is no doubt that Rachel Cusk can write. I will not dispute that. But it is clear to me that her problems have more to do with her own character, and less to do with motherhood.This book can serve as a warning to those women out there of similar attitude and outlook--who perhaps should think twice before they bring a little one into the world."
1,Coping with motherhood,"I was drawn to this book at first glance, having struggled with the isolation and dramatic identity shifts that new motherhood brings. I quickly found myself annoyed with how Rachel Cusk's intelligence, education and ability to articulate gave her a voice to express these feelings, but no way to cope. Life forces us to deal with things we hadn't anticipated; we DON'T have control over our lives if we want to live among others, be they friends, parents, siblings, spouses, or children.The balance between dependence and independence was the first lesson I learned in marriage, and it has served me well in coping with the sometimes painful aspects of being a mother. Cusk's shock at the demands of parenthood shows that she's never learned to live for/with anyone but herself. It seems a rather sad life for her and for her family."
2,Catholic girl goes bad,"Teaser review of Aftermath, sequel to A Life's Work (out August)Everyone says she writes like an angel. Now if she only had a scrap of (a) self-knowledge or (b) empathy we might be getting somewhere. This one could be a career-changer; rarely has introspection been employed to so little effect. One can only mouth a silent prayer for the children"
4,great read,"I found this book very interesting to read, especially since I've never had a baby and was curious about what motherhood is really like. I enjoyed the honesty of the author which gave me a great insight into the challenges that you face as a new mom. None of my friends with kids have ever talked this candidly about their motherhood experience. They always just say ""It's great!""I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever thought about having a baby. This book will lay out the Pros and Cons for you!"
5,Wonderfully honest and intelligent,"I absolutely love this book, and have read several books by this author because of it. I thought it was so honest and intelligent. I was pregnant at the time, and saw a review in Psychology Today so I decided to give it a shot. I could really relate to her, and thought that she was far more honest than most writers and books out there that describe motherhood. I was really sad when I finished because I wanted more! Thankfully she has written a great deal of books that I am currently enjoying when I have the time."
2,"Rachel, quit your whining!","As a mother of two, this book was a HUGE waste of my time. No one ever said that motherhood was easy; in fact, it is the toughest, and most important job in the world. Not everyone has what it takes to be a mother -- it is a serious and life-altering experience. Perhaps Rachel wrote this book in the depths of postpartum depression?!?! Save your money -- especially if you are a parent. Use your reading time wisely and pass on this one. This was truly a letdown-- I read Rachel's book ""The Country Life"" and it is one of my all-time favorite books. Can't win them all!"
3,"Great content, tedious presentation","I was looking for another new mom to commiserate with--and I found it in Rachel Cusk! BUT... my brain is fried--I have a new baby! How the heck am I supposed to concentrate to read this book?! It is obviously written for students of literature. I caught some glimpses of her in there, but mostly she was writing to hear herself talk. Which is ok for a work of literature, but I was just looking for a fun non-fiction read."
1,One-sided and almost dull,"I'm pregnant with my first child and was also looking on personal accounts of the ""mother"" experience. I guess I can't say if it's right or not, still being pregnant but my best guess is that this is very slanted. So this woman felt invaded and overwhelmed with her daughter, but hey, what did she expect?I'm tired of people having babies and then complaining that they can't continue their life as it used to be before. Hello?! What did you have a child for? To play with it a little and then put it on a shelf?"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"If you plan to purchase a book based on its literary value, this may be the book for you. If you want a book that contains down-to-earth, real-life experiences and philosophies, do NOT buy this book. It is the complete opposite of a personal insight to motherhood. It was certainly a disappointment to me, and I plan to recoup some of my costs in either a yard sale. If not, I may cut my losses and give it to the local library."
5,A voice not heard,"I was not familiar with Ms.Cusk's work prior to reading this book. I am a new mother and A Life's Work was recommended to me.Her voice is one that is not heard in books about motherhood. My thougths echoed in her words.Pregnancy and motherhood has been humbling, humiliating and exhausting. I love my daughter but I never could have anticipated the emotional journey I was embarking on.Rachel Cusk does not put a pretty pink wash on everything. It is a clean true voice.I recommend this book to any woman trying to find where she has gotten lost in her life."
4,I could relate,"This is a starkly honest, almost poetically written, book that made me both cringe and laugh. It will be most enjoyed by a very cerebral reader who has experienced some disappointment in birth or mothering an infant (e.g., postpartum depression, inability to breastfeed, unexpected C-section). I would not recommend it for pregnant women or cheerful people who are intent on only seeing the best in a situation. This is mothering at its worst, though infused with love. The section on men who blow the cover on women who hide the difficulties in mothering is very humorous and worth reading. For those who wonder why the author couldn't cope better, this section describes the sort of conspiracy among mothers that prevents total honesty. At any rate, it's very well-written and will elicit nods of recognition and relief from those who've ""been there."" You know who you are."
3,What the ?,"This is a very good compilation. But what could have made it excellent is THE FULL VERSION OF THE ""WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT"" MUSIC VIDEO !That's right. They used the MTV edit instead of the full video, dropping the intro entirely. AND Dee Snider actually complains about MTV's editing right before the edited video plays !The end of that video was also edited out so this is no video archive.It fells like one of those cheap metal compilation DVDs where music videos and grainy live footage are simply thrown together.Yes, the interviews are great but the live footage was only o.k. They could definitely have done more with this compilation."
1,I am not gonna take it!,I bought only for the WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT video. And it's incomplete! The best lines are missing! Don't buy it!Twisted Sister: The Video Years
5,I WANNA ROCK !!!!,"TWISTED SISTER WERE ONE OF THE FIRST METAL STARS OF MTV AND HAVE BECOME VIDEO ICONS. THIS LONG OVERDUE DVD SHOWS WHY. IT SHOWS BOTH SIDES OF THE BAND. THE ALMOST CARTOONISH VIDEOS THAT MADE THEM HOUSEHOLD NAMES, BUT ALSO LIVE PERFORMANCES THAT SHOW WHY THE BAND DREW RECORD COMPANY INTEREST IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS SOMEONE WHO SAW T.S. IN THEIR EARLY CLUB DAYS, IT'S GREAT THAT THE DVD LEADS OFF WITH A 1982 LIVE T.V. APPEARANCE IN ENGLAND (IT'S ONLY R&R,BUT I LIKE IT)IT'S A CLASSIC COVER FROM THEIR CLUB DAYS THAT SHOWS WHAT THE BOYS CAN DO TO A LIVE CROWD. THEN COME THE VIDEOS EVERYONE KNOWS AND LOVES. THERE IS PLENTY OF COMMENTARY FROM BAND MEMBERS AND RECORD COMPANY PEOPLE. THEY INTRODUCE THE CLASSICS, ""WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT"", ""I WANNA ROCK"", AND MORE.THEY EVEN TELL WHAT A MISTAKE ""LEADER OF THE PACK"" WAS AND HOW IT HASTENED THE END OF THE BAND.THE DVD ENDS WITH A CLASSIC LIVE CALIF. SHOW FROM 1984.MILD FANS WILL GET A KICK OUT OF IT. TRUE FANS WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. VIN HEALEY"
2,Not as pictured,"I wanted a shiny patent leather belt. That is what the product description claimed, but when I received the product I learned it is not shiny at all. It is also poorly made."
3,Cool music for relaxing,"I stumbled upon this CD recently while looking for some music to take to work. I used to play this CD all the time because it soothes me. Najee is really gifted, and I wonder why we've not heard from him lately.Not to come off as some type of purist, but I think this music is more easy listening than Jazz -- kind of like Kenny G., Dave Koz and that ilk. It's hard for me to explain my reasoning, but this music doesn't evoke the same feel as does classic Miles or even contemporary artists like Wynton Marsalis and Cassandra Wilson. It's just not edgy enough. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it.As usual, Najee's playing is enhanced by some impressive guest vocals. Freddy Jackson guests on the pretty ballad ""All I Ever Ask,"" and Jeffrey Osborne shines on ""Loving Every Minute."""
4,A Remake Of A Color Me Badd Song?,"Najee has to be the best saxophonist/flutist around. Obviously, since this came out in '93, some of these songs are kinda old skool (""Burn It Up,"" ""Breezy""), but this is of no matter to me, as the songs still good. Check out ""Touch Of Heaven,"" the Color Me Badd remake ""I Adore Mi Amor,"" ""Just An Illusion,"" ""Noah's Ark"", and my favorite one, ""Skyline."" If you like smooth jazz, Najee is the one to pick up."
4,Romance Najee is there,"Heavy traffic, bad commute, pop in a the CD Just an Illusion and chill out with the thoughts of something soothing and romantic. Let's hope that we all remember how romance truly is developed.A true fan who one day will own all of Najee's work. Piece by piece."
5,LOOKING BACK: There are no mirages that come with this cd.,"This is one of the most beloved comtemporary jazz recordings that I own. I fell in love with JUST AN ILLUSION when it was first released, and because of that one song, I brought the cassette. LOVED IT! Years later, I found it in cd format and purchsed it again, only to have it taken from me. Came across it again and brought it. Now, it stays with me. The additional vocal performances by Jeffrey Osbourne, Will Downing, Freddie Jackson & Caron Wheeler, the instrumentals....everything just came together and fit perfectly. This is one of those cd's that can be played anywhere...at home while relaxing, in the car...just anywhere. This is a classic that smooth jazz fans will not forget."
1,Wrong take on attachment,"The author cites and recommends various times the writings of Gregory Keck and Hopkins-Best. These are proponents of Attachment (Holding) Therapy and the bogus ""attachment disorder"" (not to be confused with Reactive Attachment Disorder). Find a better source of information on child development and attachment than this book."
4,Careful...,"I have the 1987 edition of this book and it contains incorrect information regarding intercountry adoption (i.e. giving the impression that a couple/single parent may arrange a private adoption in ECUADOR.) This may have been the case many, many years ago, but it is NOT the case now. I am curious to see what the current edition has to say about this. Other than this misinformation, I have found the book to be helpful."
3,"Useful, but outdated","This book provides a solid overview of the adoption process. However, it was written a decade ago, and much of the information is now out-of-date. For people considering international adoption, I'd recommend Dawn Davenport's book, The Complete Book of International Adoption. The two books are similar in content, but Davenport's is current. The Gilman book is still worthwhile, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
5,A great place to start!,"Wow, this book is packed with information! It is an excellent starting point for anyone considering adopting."
3,Dawns reviews,Movie was ok. Good surprise ending. I was disappointed that the real Winchester Mystery House wasn't used as I thought it would be.
4,"Revisiting ""One Step Beyond""","This reminded me so much of an episode from the classic TV show ""One Step Beyond"" hosted by John Newland. Lira Kellerman is fantastic and holds the glue and the clue to this film. She was fantastic in ""Junction"" and is the principal in this chilling ghost story. While others gave so-so reviews, this is a great throw-back to what ghost tales are all about. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,Haunting of Winchester House,"I have seen scarier stuff in Goosebumps! this movie while yes based loosely on the REAL Winchester house which looks like nothing of the one in this film.(it looks Cgi'd In Bad or drawn in!). The movie is rarely scary,and there is even bad editing like a moment when it seems they are rewinding the film? also the End while a good twist if not Cliched and done so many times in so many movies still makes this low budget in a bad way movie still not worth watching."
2,Could have gotten a higher rating if only....,"....t.here were better actors!!! I went into this expecting the worst but it wasnt bad at all. I would have given it a 4 stars but the acting was horrendous and the scare was really, really cheezy. The story line was good and the ending was awesome."
4,fun little horror flick,"Great to see the Asylum getting back to it's horror roots! This is a wonderful little low budget horror flick. Creepy in an Alfred Hitchcock sort of way. More of a ghost story than horror. The cast was very likable, especially the mother and abducted daughter. The handmade fx gave it a cool retro feel. You could tell the filmmakers and crew had alot of fun with this one."
1,Wow-That was bad!,Words cannot express how bad this movie was. It was in a $5 bin at Walmart where it should have stayed. Save your money & your time & don't bother with this movie.
1,"Save your time and money, this movie sucks.","I have been to the Winchester house, and it's in the middle of town, not in the woods. This is not a true story, it's just crap. I hate the fact that I was taken in and bought this tripe. It's $5 at Walmart, but don't buy it."
1,"Really, Really Bad Cheesmo Garbage",I just rented and watched this 2D 3D movie and it's REALLY bad! I felt bad for some of the actors that gave it there all but this should never have been made and released to the public. If you think some guy walking around behind the actors like 6 times and people standing around in the dark is scary then go for it. I will give them credit for trying a twist but this whole thing was SO SO unoriginal in a terrible way.The first CG shot of the house and the bad acting really set the stage for more of this bad movie. I fast forwarded through to see if anything was worth watching and it just kept getting worse. The one black actor who was the ghost hunter was HORRIBLE! 45 minutes of my life now gone...
2,"Not great acting, though the house is a real place","Yes, there is a Winchester House and it has far too many rooms, far more than what is shown in this film, which is essentially a ripoff of The Others with Nicole Kidman. I will not say anything further except that you would be better off watching that film."
2,SILLY SPOOKS,"There really is a Winchester house and it is supposedly haunted...but this movie has little to do with it. True events are mentioned briefly but don't really relate. So how is the movie? It's not very good. Horrible acting, lighting, direction, partially redeemed by an unexpected twist at the end. There are some unintentional laughs as well. Rent..don't buy."
3,"Bad movie, reminds me of bad movies from the 60's","I was expecting the worst from this movie, The acting was bad, right from the start, the scenery was bad, looked like someones personal property, with stock scenes of the real Winchester house thrown in, and the special effects right out of high school film class. But something happened along the way.... I got hooked. There is a semblance of a story here and a couple of scares and a neat twisty ending. I cant help but think, that with a bigger budget and a better director, this could have been a decent movie. Or maybe that would have ruined this little bit of film school project fun. Think back to Dont look in the Basement or Children shouldnt play with dead things- This is of that ilk. Good for a rainy afternoon with some good natured friends for some smart alecky quips and dumb over the dialog comments."
2,"pretty bad, but I've seen worse","I'm not sure what was missing in this movie - good acting, special effects, or what - but something was wrong and haunts me still. The music seemed too much, maybe too loud, but overbearing in some way. The story, which is supposed to be a true story, was bogged down by something, but I can't quite put my finger on it... The ending was a little unexpected, which makes it good, I think, but the ending, because it's good maybe, seemed out of place. I don't know exactly what's wrong with this movie, maybe multiple things, but I won't watch it again, no doubt. (And the ""bonus"" stories are a little overdone, too, I think.)"
1,Upgrade policy is too strict.,"Microsoft is too bossy about their upgrade policies. I own Access 95, but the package says that I am not eligible for this upgrade. You have to have Access 97 or later in order to use this product."
5,Great product and delivery!!!,Beautiful pattern!! I love it!! It will adorn our dinner table.Thank you so much for the very quick shipment!!
4,Let's Color!,"This barbie coloring book is only a coloring book, it is not an activity book. Its very fun you can see Barbie and her friends trying to be stars. it is a bit thin."
5,"The lover, the letter, and the beautiful backdrop of northern Japan","A woman loses her fiance in an accident and begins to correspond to an old classmate of his. In her attempts to reconnect with her dead lover, the letter between her and his school friend bring back to life many ghosts of memories and unknown histories. A stirring film on the depths of the human heart."
1,To who wrote this book,I wanted to do a book report on korn my favoret group but it curses to much wy do you havto do that micster37@hotmail.com
4,This book was good but...,"I liked this book alot. It had good information and the pictures were great. The only thing was that some of the pictures were backwards. David's tattoo was on the wrong side in one pic and a picture of the whole band playing live is backwards too, Head and Munky are on the wrong sides and are playing with the wrong hands. There are two other pics of Head playing with the wrong hand. One pic has Jon playing the bagpipes backwards too, his HIV tattoo is supposed to be on his left arm, not the clown tearing up his skin. Other than that tiny mistake, i think the book was good and I recomend it to other Korn fans."
5,Korny Midge,"this book is realy good, it offers so much info on how the band started and little extras that you may, or may not have wanted to know. i wasnt expecting it to be this good"
5,GREAT!,I am KoRn's #1 fan and I must say that this was awesome. I only wish there were more books out there. BUY IT!
4,filled in all gaps in my knowledge of korn,this book describes the story of how korn started from when they were teenagers till presently. it completes every korn collection. it seemed a bit biased on telling jonathon davis' life more than the others and was only a little back on the times. that's what gave it 4 stars rather than 5.
5,KoRn is the best@!!,This book was a very great window into there lives and i really think that it was perfect!! I love that man that wrote that book (not as much as i love korn) but n e ways that book was good buy it read it enjoy it!!
5,Fantastic,"The Detail is amazing on the various ports and moveable joints, and the BFG rifle that transforms along the adjustable side piece helps add to the design of this figure."
2,A Slow Read,"Quartered Safe Out Here was far from the best personal accounts of participation in WWII. It does not hold a candle to Eugene Sledge's, With the Old Breed. Quartered is slow moving, without much real action. Much of the action in the campaign seems to take place on other fronts, and this is mostly about ""camp life""."
5,"Great read, great history","If you have any interest in WWII (or any military conflict), buy this book. It is one of the best, a great read, and great history. One of George MacDonald Fraser's finest works."
5,Is THIS What We Were Fighting For?,"A superb narrative of the ""forgotten"" war in Burma in WWII that allows Fraser to comment on not only the war itself and those close to him in combat but a biting commentary on revisionist historians and their efforts to look backwards at events from today's politically correct perspective.The tale itself is a loosely jointed account of short, vicious actions in the chaos that surrounded the last days of the Japanese Empire in Southeast Asia and the Commonwealth's role in ending it. Images of both the tedium and confusion of men subject to the vague ""plans"" of headquarters as well as vivid discriptions of close combat against a tenacious enemy make this both an historically interesting ""read"" as well as a informative glimpse of Fraser's generation who went off to the four corners of the globe to ""make the world safe for democracy"". Did they truly risk their lives for the society we live in today"
5,"Quartered Safe Out Here, MacDonald/Frazer","The author's recollections of his time in an obscure part of WWII are absolutely enthralling. His use of the Scotish/British brog in naration was at first difficult to read and understand requiring several re-reads of sentences. But that became the added charm and wit that almost unconsciously absorbs the reader. He captures the readers interest with not only the language, but his vivid description of events and his honest confessions of lapses in memory leading up to those events. For anyone interested in military history this description of the regimental fight Burma is a must."
5,A Great Book about a forgotten war & now vanished great Army,"GMF has outdone himself with this book about his part in the Horrific war in Burma during War II. He tells of his time as a junior enlist then junior NCO with the Border Regiment. He spins his tale extremely well about the story of the last great War fought by the Old Anglo-Indian Army of the Raj. So if you want to get a feel for a bygone Army, its various & exotic troops, weapons and some great characters like the Iron Duke and the Impressive FM Slim then this is the place for you."
2,Dissapointed,"I was kind of disappointed with the Black& Decker Power Mop, it is to bottom heavey to flip the scrubbing brush easily. You have to use two hands to flip the brush down and two hands to push the brush away.I have already told friends ""don't bother to spend $49 for this mop, it isn't worth the money.Get a women to design this product. I can't believe a women would have found this easy to use."
1,Sooo disappointed,"When I saw the commercial for this I thought this was exactly what I wanted. It's like a swiffer wetjet, but with a scrubber to clean my grout that the swiffer can't, and I can use my own cleaning product! I rushed to buy it. After one week the sprayer stopped spraying anything. I returned it for a new one and it did the same thing so I got a refund and went back to my swiffer. I was very disappointed in this product. I expected much more from Black & Decker, hopefully they will fix the defects in this product as it is an ingenius idea ."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Surprisingly bad design by Black and Decker. well, actually, the scrubber is cool. But the liquid shoots out with all the power of a dollar store squirt gun. then it eventually clogs up and the spray barely comes out at all. there were no Black and Decker pads for this on the market (that I could find in 12/2006) and I haven't liked attaching what are essentially wet wipes to the bottom of it. So we went back to our swiffer and wrote this off as a mistake."
1,Dont waist your money,I couldnt wait to get this for christmas ( becasue it was sold out at every store in my area) The item went together faily easy but could not get it to spray out the cleaning solution. I had to TAKE PARTS OUT of where there liquid goes in just to get it to half way work
1,not great,Product was broken on arrival. Seller chadandnani would not take back. Had to call the factory for a replacement.Would never buy from this seller again. I don't think they care as long as they got rid of thier defective product.
1,Very Disappointing,"The concept is great, but the execution is poor. I loved the idea of the rotating brush for vinyl floors, and that did work well. The mop is very heavy, but I discovered I didn't have to press down on it, kind of like using a heavier iron. The big problem is the sprayer-it was so hard to use I had to use both hands, and I have pretty strong hands. The idea of carrying an extra spray bottle with you defeats the purpose of the thing. I gave up and threw it away."
4,Good job for the price,"For the price of this model, and the fact it is cordless, it does a very good job. I have textured tile floors that are a bear to clean. You can easily clean the surface, but it is very difficult to get into the textures. Usually I have to use a scrub brush and get on my hands and knees.Not with this. It did the job it said it would, really got into the ground in dirt. The solution dispenser is handy, but a spray bottle would work just as well. The scrub brush really works great, if slow.The mop is only ""okay"".Over all, this is a good buy for quick clean ups. For a big job, like doing the whole floor on a weekly basis, I'd look for a corded model. But so far the reviews I've seen don't speak highly of any model when it comes to textured tile floors."
3,Difficult to handle,"I liked that you can use your own cleaning solutions, but it is hard to push especially when the rotating brush is on, it wants to only move the way the brush is rotating. I only used it once, so maybe it will take a few times to use to get used to. It is not as easy as it looks to go from the wipe to the brush."
4,satisfied with this item,"I am very satisfied with this item. I was hesistant to buy it at first since it's a little pricy compared to other mops. Easy to follow instructions on the assembly of this product. But at first, I had a hard time making the mop work. It took me days to figure out which button to push when you want the scrubber or the pad. But after a while, I find the product very useful. I use Chlorox pads on this mop and put drops of PineSol in the water bottle. It's very effective in cleaning the floor. I usually use 2-3 Chlorox pads to clean my floor. At the last pad, I could hardly see any dirt. I also use it when I wax my floor. It is a little heavy which is good because you don't have to add pressure when you want to scrub/mop. Using this product has reduced the time I spent on cleaning. I highly recommended it to my friends. In fact, I let them use it in their apartments."
1,No Power at All,"I was unable to try the power mop because it wouldn't run. I bought brand new batteries to exchange for the furnished ones and it made no difference--the thing still would not run. The mop part was just a Swiffer which I really don't care for at all. I packed it up per your internet instructions and sent it back {a few days after Christmas). Frankly I have been surprised that you have not credited my charge card.In answer to your original question, I didn't like the product at all and would never recommend it.Hattie Landman"
1,"Disappointed, again","I thought choosing a ""Black & Decker"" product I would be good,.... well, Not at all. The product does not fit together to look like picture, even after taking it apart and trying 2 more times. the liquid canister does not secure into place... the trigger is stuck in,... and the most important feature, the scrubber, does not scrubb!... I still have to put major pressure to clean coffee spots/drips and still I would rather just get on my hands and knee because it is a lot quicker!Totally Disappointed!"
4,Their pads or not.,"I would have liked it better if the generic brand pads worked but after a pass they fall off. The other problem was the batteries were corroded even though they were in a zip lock bag? I have a bad back and knees and cannot bend to scrub the floor or the tub, for that....thank you!"
2,Okay product,"The scrubber works well getting scuff marks off of my wood floors, although doesn't do much on the grout on my tile floor.Squirter doesn't always work, and only the pads that came with the product seem to work and I am not sure where to find them.I think just a swiffer would do."
2,Black and Decker Power Mop---- not for me or any one but an athlete,had trouble finding out how to put it together--- then the motor started and would not stop--- had trouble getting the bottom in the right angle to stop it and then the slightest movement and it would go on again.I would return it but it is too heavy to move--- heavy to move to make it change to mop part from brush part and making the motor stop was a formidable task.I will let he battery run out and try it a few more times and try to use it just as a heavy mop. that should not take too long.
1,A waste of money,"I really hate I bought this item. From what it looked like on television it would be a great product. NOT! I already have the Clorox Mop but thought that this would be better than the Clorox Mop. Big mistake. The commercial is misleading and the solution does not even squirt out like the Clorox Mop does. You have to keep pushing the nob to get the solution out. I will continue to use my Clorox Mop, glad I did not throw it away. Feel like throwing this one away and the money that I wasted on buying it plus the shipping and handling costs!"
2,poorly built,"I bought this power mop for my daughter for Christmas, and it broke the first time she used it."
1,Worst Black and Decker product,"This power mop is the worst product from Black and Decker that I ever had. It is clumsy, heavy, and awkward to use. In addition the spray mechanism stops spraying after a few uses. Amazon replaced the unit with a new one and it failed in the same way after a few uses. My wife went back to her Clorox swifter. My wife does like the power brush on the B&D mop, but that feature does not make up for of the other inadequacies and design defects."
3,Not as impressed as I thought I would be,"This is probably much like a Swifter, but nice having the scrubber function. My problem is with the floor cleaner ejector. I feel like I'm going to get carpal tunnel syndrome squeezing it so many times with little result. Not much spray comes out. I got a bottle sprayer and used that in addition to the B&D product. It's a little heavy too. If you don't have grout to scrub, I would suggest getting a Swifter product instead."
5,You won't stop laughing!!,"I had the good fortune of meeting Suzanne this past Valentine's day in Houston,TX and bought this cd and had it autographed and such. She is such a down-to-earth, sweet person. I loved this cd and still laugh at it even though I've listened to it a 100 or more times. I highly recommend this cd as well as any of her others if you like to laugh.*If you are offended by language or sexual content DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM*"
5,oldie but goodie,super funny. great for long commutes or car rides. left me laughing and laughing. now to check out all of her other comdedy albums!
4,Chita Rivera & Rita Moreno just dropped dead from sheer envy,"Don't be fooled by that deceptive cover shot of a nerdadelic Liz prancing around like a Method-spanker from TEENAGE ENEMA NURSES IN BONDAGE. Liz is a seasoned pro who warmed up for this record by essaying the role of Sieglinde during last year's Wagnerwankerung at Bayreuth. (I vas dere, Chahlie.) My fave track is their rendition of Graham Parker's LOCAL GIRLS. Andrew Nafziger's wah-wah pedal was a butt-scrumptious touch."
3,Lovely Voice,"Elizabeth has a wonderful voice. I'm not sure about the selection of songs or the band. I prefer her album ""The Laziest Girl in Town"""
5,Good Clamp,"Good, sturdy aluminum seat clamp. Lever is a bit tight, but loosened-up with a dab of grease."
3,This book was reasonably good.,The book was pretty good except for the fact that it was so short. The essence of the book was barely acknowledged. If this book had been longer I would have given it 5 stars
2,"This book was OK, but it was too short!","This book was pretty good. The topic of it was prettyinteresting. But the story was way too short. I think HansPeter Richter should have made this book longer. And there wasreally no conclusion to this book. All the ending was about wasFriedrich surviving the shelling and he leaving his best friend'sfamily. I thought there should of been a better ending thanthis one. Steven Yum, 6th grade, American School in Japan."
5,Lucked out w this one!,My daughter randomly picked this from a list of book choices for an honors class in high school so we ordered not knowing the book length or reviews. She loved the story which made her cry and was glad to see the book was short allowing more time for the written part of the assignment. She recommends it to anyone who is intrigued by the holocaust and the choices people made during that time.
4,Friedrich,"Hans and his best friend Friedrich have grown up together in the same building in Germany. However, Friedrich's family is Jewish. As Hitler comes to power, Friedrich's dad is forced to quit his job and Friedrich is kicked out of school. things change for Friedrich and his family. Friedrich's father is forced to quit is job, because Hitler does not allow Jews to own a business. While Hans joins the Hitler youth, he is forced to keep his friendship with Friedrich a secret. When Friedrich's mom is killed by the Nazi's and his father is sent to a concentration camp, Hans and his family try and help Friedrich. Although the book is slow in places, it is worth a read."
4,The world I never knew of.,This eye-opening story of a young boy called Friedrich changed the way I thought about the happenings at that time. I never realised what terrible trauma the families and friends of Jews had to go through.This story also features within it many accounts of symbolism.Throughout the story it is always building up to a climax. There are many hints that lead you to things and take your mind away thinking of what will happen next...
5,"A sad story, but great for young readers","I first read this book in my English class as a 6th grader. The story is easy for kids to read, yet it doesn't seem like the ""young adult"" literature they often give to Middle School students.The story begins in Germany in the mid-1920's; the narrator is a German Christian and his buddy Friedrich is a German Jew. The narrator's family is poor and Friedrich's family is well-off, yet they are never selfish or vain. As the years pass it seems like their community is getting hostile toward Jewish people, and while the narrator doesn't seem to understand what's happening, it looks like his Jewish friend is probably more aware. Friedrich gets blamed for all sorts of things, and while they try to do the stuff kids do (see the chapters ""The Ball"" and ""The Pool"") he finds that Friedrich is seen more and more as an intruder than a customer.The last few chapters are more and more unpleasnat, the ending of which I will not reveal."
4,Friedrich,This book was fairly good. This started out very good and I thought the middle was very interesting. The part where they went to the swimming pool was a good part. The best part of the book was when they went out and played in the snow.
1,Friedrich- the worst Holocaust book I've read,"Being a Jew, the Holocaust is one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, this book really disappointed me. The first person style (told by Friedrich's best friend, who is a non-jew) is meant to show the two different effects of the uprising Nazi Germany. However, the book turns out to be a trite and annoying explanation of Jewish culture. The overall story also lacks a smooth plot and tries too hard to make each new Nazi law effect Friedrich directly. There are so many excellent WWII books written from the perspective of youths out there such as Lily's Crossing, Sky, Night, etc.. Don't waste your time reading this one."
2,I wish this book could have been shorter,I really thought this book had an ugly cover. I thought it failed to illustrate the harships of the rest of the world. Friedrich was way too self centered and I thought he was a bad person. 2 big thumbs down on this book. It should have been shorter.
2,Did Harry not care?,"This book flows quickly and easily. It's a finely crafted piece of schlock with no depth or feeling. It felt like Harrision had no joy in writing it and was just doing it for a paycheck. Earlier SSR books had me caring about the heros, hating the villains, and loving the action. This one kept my attention with skillful prose but did nothing for me. I own a copy of almost every book Harrision has written and love most of his work to pieces, but this is one of if not the worst he's ever done."
3,The End?,This book is a somewhat disappointing end to the Stainless Steel Rat series. It is really only disappointing because the others are so good. This book is worth a read because it may be the last one written and it does an okay job of wrapping up the series.
4,Small but fun,"My 6 year old seems to really enjoy it - it's sturdy, but small. Fits in his pocket... which MIGHT be a problem with the washing machine. :)"
1,Not for young children,"It should be removed from the shelves. A book that uses ""dumb"" and ""idiot"" is not appropriate for young children."
1,Jim Bezos Amazon has Nazi tactics,"Funny Jim Bezos giving opinions in this book as he allows his company to hire another company who for any reason at all bans people for life from Amazon. I had a problem shipping and now me and my entire family, even those not living with me are banned for life. Jim Bezos, 21 Century Nazi enabler."
5,GOOD AS THEY COME,"Have purchased a number of Microstation texts in the past and this is absolutely as good as they come. I use Microstation daily in my present employment and this book leaves nothing to chance. Any person not giving it a 5 star rating does not work in the ""real world"". Thanks-"
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!,"I'm a hopeless romantic & this book just feed those feelings in me. Yes if you pick it apart it is a bit far fetched but if you just read it without doing that it is very enjoyable. I couldn't put it down. I like Cinderella stories & this one keeps you guessing the whole time. It's exciting, surprising, it brings out all your emotions. It's different, maybe the author had to go a bit far fetched to accomplish this but I liked all the different twists & turns this book took."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"As much as I enjoyed the Bride of Willow Creek (5 stars) and the Wives of Bowie Stone (4 stars) that's how much I did NOT enjoy this one. The story is preposterous, the events are unlikely, the characters (except for Lily) are unsympathetic and even she begins to grate after a while. First she feels one way, then does a U-turn with respect to her feelings for Quinn. Quinn's secretiveness becomes absurd as the book progresses. - shades of Jane Eyre - And Paul is a total jerk. Still, the author's other books are well worth reading - I am reading ""Silver Lining"" at this moment. Much better."
3,Not the Best,"These chips are okay. Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange. They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty."
1,STALE. Beware buying these on special!,"I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning. Keeps you from eating too many! Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.com and this was one. Unedible. Beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case, not expired but stale and unedible just the same."
2,Kettle Chips,"Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.M. Martin"
1,"Stale, Rancid Oil Taste, And if You Like Even the Tiniest Bit of Salt Flavor on Your Chips...","...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging ""peanuts"". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great ""premium"" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!"
2,Not Very Creamy or Chivey...,"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
3,Prefer other flavors,"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tastingKettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24). Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again."
2,Good and tangy,"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"
1,Expired stock,"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.Very bad form amazon."
4,Best Chips Out There!,These are my new favorite! I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one! They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here. I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping. I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price. The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.
3,I dont know if...,I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!
5,Barbeque perfection,"The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree."
4,4 Stars for price and taste,"I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle. I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that. Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price. I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price. You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also. Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are. The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor. These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste. If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first. So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it. They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants. I recommend these, 4 stars."
4,Tangy and delicious snack,"For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less ""natural"" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5."
3,Not low salt,"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item. They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy. By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy."
4,Not quite the best...,"In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips, from the best I've ever had to big disappointments. If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products. Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors. All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice."
5,Love these chips!,"We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit!Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They aren't sold everywhere though, I'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live."
4,These chips are awesome if not best but....,I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.
4,kettle chips,"This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced!"
5,Kettle potato chips: Fully loaded baked potato,"I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!"
4,"Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!","Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip. Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned. They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off. The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai. It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger. If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them. The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."
2,salt and vinegar chips,It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.
1,The bags were damaged with holes and stains.,"The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette."
2,"Taste terrible, way too strong","Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips. These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food. The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt. Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty. But normal people, please do not try this at home."
3,Not as good as the English sell,These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORSSALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPERTUSCAN 3 CHEESEN.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERSTHEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME. IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
1,dripping in oil,"I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others."
1,gross,"These chips taste like they have been dusted with baby powder. Also they come in some kind of funky polyvinyl bag that you can't open with your bare hands and probably has a landfill halflife of 20,000 years. Buy Miss Vicky's instead."
2,Not so good.,"If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have ""just a touch."""
2,Bags O' Salt with chips added.,"I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique."
1,Chips,"These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy."
4,An addictive potato chip,Eat at your own risk. Once I would open a bag I could not stop. Good and salty.
5,Great Chip!,"I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
2,70% of the chips in the bag are over cooked,I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked. I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.Will never buy these chips from here again.
3,"Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good","Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips."
4,Very good.,Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.
5,the defacto standard for Salt and Vinegar chips,"I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares."
5,The only thing I have ever been addicted too...these chips!,I have never been addicted to anything in my life...until I tasted these chips. I have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same. You've got to stick with this blue bag of chips!
1,"I have had better ""Jalapeno Kettle Chips""","These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all. I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck. Give me pain chips any day. Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
3,Too Much Flavor,"These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness."
1,They're Not Madhouse Munchies!!!,"DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well."
1,Too SOUR!,"I love sour food but this one I can't bear. Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong. I don't like it."
2,"Love Kettle Chips, but not this flavor!",I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
3,Vinegar... Not my taste!,This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste. Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before. I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
4,Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .,"My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . ."
2,"Kettle Chips, Sea Salt","There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October."
3,Good deal but close expiration date!,"I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle. When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt. However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August. I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips. I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable! How convenient! Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date..."
5,Like Spice? Get these,"These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating. They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up. They are fantastic. If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are. Got my case right here, and loving every bite. On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite. I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle. Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!"
1,HORRIBLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS!,"Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now."
5,These chips make me weak at the knees,These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. They are by far the tastiest chips I've had and it's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag!
5,By far my favorite chips,"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks. I've tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close."
4,Yummy chips,"These are delicious. The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving."
4,"pretty good, could be better",Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.
4,"Very good, but Sharwood's better","I like Rajah hot curry - it's very good, but nothing stands out about it. Having tried Sharwood's hot curry, in comparison it's much better. I guess the ingredients are the key:Sharwood's Hot Curry Ingredients: Coriander, Turmeric, Fenugreek, Cumin, Salt, Mustard Powder, Rice Flour, Paprika, Fennel (3%), Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Cinnamon, Chilli, Clove, Ginger, Pepper, Bay Leaf, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Spice ExtractRajah Hot Curry Ingredients: Coriander, Turmeric, Chilli, Garlic, Bengal Gram, Yellow Mustard, Fenugreek, Bay Leaves, Salt, Cumin, Fennel"
3,THE STORY CONTINUES...,"This movie continues the Brave Archer Movie series of which there are 5. This second one serves mostly to continue the story and there are not as many well choreographed fights as in parts 1 and 3 and 4. As a collector of venom movies or Fu Sheng movies its a must have but don't expect too much. The saddest part for me is all the lost footage that is apparent from the flashbacks in the story. Priceless film left on some cutting room floor in Hong Kong lost to us collectors forever. Oh, this is one of the few films that Wei Pai appears in with the other venoms but if you blink you'll miss his appearance. It's in a flashback of a subplot. This movie's english title ""Kung Fu Warlords"" is so much more appropriate for this classic tale adapted from a famous novel. The first 2 parts are best enjoyed as a marathon."
2,Not so much,"I had high hopes for this thing but it's cheaply made, it's noisy (at least in the office cube), and worst of all it doesn't accelerate the top well. I've used it 3 times and that's it. Not recommended. Better off just spinning the thing yourself..."
2,"good item, but not for me","Good item, however the size isn't right for my device (for my levitation top). It would be much better if seller describe item more accurate. Valery."
1,It doesn't work. Fail!!!!,"I have order this regardless of seeing all the bad review before me. I though, I'm special and can make this work but it's not true.It doesn't work. It never work. and It will not work. Doesn't matter how new the battery is period!Complete garbage."
2,Much Slower than Outlook 2000 an not much different.,"Wow, this is an upgrade,NOT!! You've got to be kidding me. New features are mostly worthless and it runs much slower than 2000 on my Pentium 1.4 ghz with 512 MB RAM.Not only will you be disappointed, but you will have wasted your money. I enjoy MS Office, but their upgrades are no longer worth paying for. To boot, we now have to activate our product through Microsoft...what a joke!If your new to computing, be smart and look for Office Suite alternatives."
1,The Address Book is Terrible!,"I recently purchase Outlook and have been very disappointed in its ability to organize the addresses in the address book. You can organize distribution lists, but you can not put them in separate folders so they are all lumped together. Plus, I have had a hard time trying to get the program to import addresses. I have used other email programs that were much easier to use. It may have some extras related to time management, but watch out when you go to build an address book. I would NOT recommend this program."
4,Good program but why pay the money??,"After using many many different e-mail prgrams this one is probably the best that is only besause a bought the office suite, but do you really need it? you might try downloading some free trials of other programs like, eudora before you buy outlook they are a lot cheaper.If you are a 2000 outlook user this version is NO DIFFERENTo yea the buttons look a little different thats about it!"
1,MIcrosoft Outlook,Probably the worst program known to mankind. Will destroy your computer. Consistently crashes and renders other programs inoperable. Don't know why Gates isn't in jail for this one.
5,"He's alright, nobody worry 'bout him.","Got this little guy as a birthday gift for my buddy. Must have hit the button a good 15 times before he ever saw it. I'm 100% pleased. While he of course doesn't look exactly like the one from the film, the photo doesn't do it justice at all. His coloring and fullness are great, the audio is pretty clear and the dance is adorable, much better in person."
3,Something my wife just had to have,"She saw 1 in a shop and tried to buy it but they wouldn't sell it, so I found it on line anything to keep them happy"
5,gopher,I purchased this toy as a goft for a friend.He was very excited about it and has it in a place of honor on his bar.I recieved it quickly and in perfect condition.I would not hesitate in ordering from this company again.I am very satisfied with my purchace.
5,"26"" Spoked Wheel and Tire Assembly","I bought two wheel and tire assemblies to replace the ones on my garden cart. They arrived in good condition and all I had to do was air them up and put them on the cart, which I did in about 10 minutes. They fit perfectly and work as well as the originals plus I saved 50%. I am happy."
2,ok product,"It's ok and I'll use this one till it runs out as opposed to having to throw it out. It is not all metal corner. Right were the corner is, it is still paper. Basically it is a paper tape with 2 metal strips on it. I'd go with a different product next time."
3,Not for Soundstation2,"I'm sure this product is great for its intended purpose and compatibility. Unfortunately it is not compatible with the Soundstation2 extended microphones for which I bought it. The SS2 microphones use a 4-wire cable (white, red, black, green) and these (though they terminate in a jack with 4 connectors) only has 3 wires (white, red, black). Wish I had realized when I put the order in that 'for Soundstation' does not mean 'for Soundstation2.'"
4,A Fine Novel,"With its beautifully-etched characters and superbly rendered sense of time and place, In Tall Cotton is one of the better coming-of-age novels I've read. It's not without some cliches (and whoever decided upon that cover should be shot!), but at its best it's heartbreaking and highly evocative."
3,Homo-erotica meets the Depression,"It was a good enough novel in itself, but there is much more worthwhile literature out there. Many parts of this book make one feel dirty and ashamed to be reading it around one's family, but perhaps such strong feelings (good or bad) is what makes a story great. I would be weary about letting children around this book and the description on the back cover is a bit misleading. Most of his ""childhood experiences"" are homosexual in nature, which was not what was described on the back. It was an interesting story, however, but just know what you are getting into before reading it. The characters are very well done and the historical value is relevant. Some of the characters may be all too real, but the development of the book is good also."
4,"Simple, but wonderful...","Poppy's new book is unlike anything she has written before. Her writing style and everything has become more sparse, but at the same time more concrete. I have always been a borderline fan of Poppy's, but that might be because the first book of hers I tried to read was _Exquisite Corpse_, which I had to put down. Her writing of late, whether it be short fiction or novel length, is just really good! Because of this, I now count myself an addict and avidly look forward to what ever comes next."
2,X = Not Much,"I have deeply loved each and every one of Poppy's previous stories, both long and short and couldn't wait to get my hands on ""The Value of X"". Sad to say, I was very disappointed. This book reminded me of nothing so much as poorly written fanfic. The characters are sweet and engaging but their dialogue is wooden and artificial sounding. Whereas the jacket promised an in depth look at the ""pirate crew"" culture of the restaurant world, I felt that I was getting a mere glimpse. Overall it seemed like this was ""Poppy-lite"", nothing dark, nothing dangerous. It felt like it was written for adolescents. Maybe that's because she was trying to capture the mindset of her young protaganists but I think she did a much better job with Nothing, Steve, Ghost, Tran and my favorites, Zach and Trev. I'll definitely still read anything new of Poppy's but have my fingers crossed that it'll be a lot better than ""X""."
5,nothing substitutes the castle/sanctuary remaster!!!,"I'm mainly writing this review as a public service announcement. The Castle/Sanctuary re-issues are available at amazon's UK site (amazon.co.uk) for normal, low CD prices. As a fan of rock and pop you owe it to yourself to buy this CD along with the ones that followed through 'Lola' ('Percy' on is your call ;)) First of all, the Castle/Sanctuary reissue has lots of awesome bonus tracks including ""I'm Not Like Everybody Else"" and ""Dead End Street"". This is the only version to buy. This is one of the best Kinks albums, showcasing Ray Davies and brother Dave writing infallible pop melodies in various sub-genres and applying them to witty, at times condescending lyrics about various folks in British middle class society but nonetheless applicable to anybody with a dry, sarcastic sense of humor. this is the start of the Kinks' awesome second phase which would end with the 'Lola' album. Buy it now!!!"
4,The Beggining of the Kinks Peak,"This album showed that the Kinks were headed down a new creative path.The only rocker is the opening track which is awesome. ""Party Line"" is a funny song. Then there's ""Rosie Won't You Please Come Home"" which is the sound most of the album has. ""Dandy"" is a funny jab at Dave's party going lifestyle from his brother Ray. ""Holiday in Waikiki"" is skippable and seems to be ripping off ""Last Train To Clarksville"" by The Monkees and ""19th Nervous Breakdown"" by the Rolling Stones. But, it seems to only be me who thinks this.The album also has ""Sunny Afternoon"" which is one of the Kinks most famous songs. It's also the album's best.There's also one bonus track that I quite like: ""Dead End Street"" which is a cynical song. It's probably the only bonus track that I felt was essential. Although this album isn't as essential as other Kinks discs (I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could), it is still essential and worth the money."
5,Another Classic,"This was another classic Kinks album. If you like the group and you have a lot of their stuff, you have to have this one."
4,Listen To This!,"Here's another album that came out in 1966 that a lot of people have not heard too much about. I was one of them.I really like The Kinks, but since I've never seen this album on any list of greats, I never looked into it.I was very surprised by Face To Face. I don't know who produced it, but it has a great sound to it. Especially the drums and bass. And the guitars are always good with The Kinks. I also like Ray Davies's lyrics about rich people!There you go. My review."
5,"Stunning artwork, simple truths",One of my favorite illustrated children's books. Christopher's grandfather uses the pear tree in his yard to help Christopher understand the passage of the seasons. Wonderful illustrations incorporate Czech folk motifs to evoke Grandfather's childhood. Each page is a work of art in itself.
3,"Nice story, but a unbelievable","I mean, think about this. The son of the black stallion - Satan - is so terrible at the beginning of the book that Henry doesn't want him around Alec. Henry sees something in the colt's stony gaze that makes him think that this horse is a demon, worse than his sire. Alec doesn't believe him, thinking that 'oh, this is my horse, he'll fall in love with me like the Black did'. The thing is, it doesn't work that way. And even after the horse is saved by Alec, he shouldn't all of a sudden act like he trusts the boy. If anything, in my experience with horses, the animal would be much more skittish than ever with someone connected to that event. Henry in particular, yes, but Alec too since he was around. Anywho, read the book. It's good beside that."
4,this definately is...,"the easiest CT album to pick up. ìt`s never too heavy for yr mental condition apart from maybe too soft at times (then i`ll go put on a Melvins record instead). and all that stuff about how CT music is the ultimate sex soundtrack? i never have sex to CT, but then again i don`t get it very often. CTs music suits me in totally other occasions. i only listen to them when i`m completely alone wit my thougts. i do get some' out of listening closely to their music, not just playing it in the background while you have sex. no this is good music, not muzak. favorites are: track 1,3,4,7 & 10."
5,a cross between a seance and really good sex,"if angels and spirits could communicate with humans on earth, they would do so through elisabeth fraser. her voice transcends everything."
4,Fan-tastic,"While this later release from the gifted trio Cocteau Twins may not have tread in any new sonic territory, a la ""Treasure"" or the stunning ""Heaven or Las Vegas"", it still does a killer job of sounding gorgeous. ""Bluebeard"" may be the most perfect pop song you never heard."
3,The Beginning of the End,"When I first heard this album it seemed that the always fascinating and surreal Cocteaus would live and create music forever, but upon closer inspection any fan of Cocteau Twins will slowly become aware that this album is really a weak carbon copy of their ealier music. In comparsion with Tiny Dynamine, Echos in a Shallow Bay or Pink Opaque, Cocteaus have lost a lot of their breath-taking genius that made them so wonderful in their works from the eighties. True, Essence and Pur are great tracks from Calendar but if you are looking to find out about the artists behind the music, start with anything on the 4AD label."
3,"mellow, ambient music if you're in the mood for it","Interestingly enough, i found this cd in a thrift-store bin for a few cents and decided to give it a whirl. Never having heard of CT before, i would describe them as mellow, alterna-ambient, and ethereal sounding with the guitars adding a bit of folk. Vocals are angelic, light, airy. The pace of this album is very slo-mo, ""chilling""-type music. As another reviewer said, it's background music for an underground coffee house. If you're not familiar with this type of music, or are expecting something fast-paced/electronic-based(i.e. dance music), you're going to be disappointed. Needless to say, i'm glad this cd didn't cost me much. Nevertheless, i gave the cd a fair listen, and have to admit that tracks 4, 5, and 6 stand out as the ""stars"" of this album, and i can tell a lot of work went into this cd."
2,Pearls covered in dirt...,"That's what you'll find on Four Calendar Cafe. Make sure you have the patience to survive pure boredom and lack of soul until you reach the divine Squeeze-Wax, which in reality is one of the two only true Cocteau-spirited songs on this album.The Cocteau Twins were always masters at creating sweet, atmospheric, romantic and meaningful music without ever getting soppy or too pathetic (the wonderful Aikea-Guinea will attest to that), but on this record, all that is sweet is revolting. Honestly. Save for aforementioned Squeeze-Wax and Summerhead, this one belongs in the bin.Thank god they recovered before their last effort."
2,Stagnant,"Though most of the elements of good music are there, and Elizabeth Fraser's vocals are truly amazing (making this album at least listenable) nothing here is going anywhere. You are always left expecting somthing to happen, (it never does) and though it definately trys, it fails to invoke any sort of real feeling or aptmosphere. I recommend you check out some of this bands earlier stuff, or better yet, Fraser's appearences in Massive Attacks ""Mezzanane"" which have to be some of the best sound ever to grace my ears."
1,Toothless,"This music has no bite. I purchased this album after hearing ""Mezzanine"" by Massive Attack; a Cocteau Twins vocalist appeared on that album and sounded gorgeous. Well, the vocals on this recording (which are competent) are wasted by goofy, less-than-ordinary attempts at ""atmospheric"" melodies. The lyrics are awful. Background music? I can think of no activity for which this horrid record would serve as a suitable companion. Go listen to My Bloody Valentine for an example of real ""atmospheric"" music.I'm told by a Cocteau fan that this isn't their best. Well, in my CD collection, it's the worst."
3,Ditch the café,"I'm just going to say that you should hit everything recorded by the Cocteau Twins prior to this. Well, scratch that, as by any other standards this is a very good record, but on this astral turf it's perplexing. Is Liz singing intelligible lyrics? Exactly. It's been said elsewhere that this is probably their upper limit, so Four-Calendar Café is probably a decent bet, really, but, to cap off what's probably making very little sense, don't expect the stars from this effort. Go into the past if you're really hungry, but that's usually the way it goes, right?"
5,Must buy ! (or borrow or steal !!),"If you've only heard Joyride and How do you do, then you obviously haven't heard the wide range of sounds and emotions that Roxette generates. Cinnamon street and Steel Blue are just amazing. I do not lend out this cd (unlike others) in fear of losing it !!!!"
5,Jim Carey and Freddie Prinze combined!!!,"I have heard so many different styles of comedy that rarely do I laugh out loud. After hearing Pablo on the radio here in Los Angeles I had to run out and get his tape, I am bummed now that I didn't get the CD. When I heard it for the first time I almost pee'd my pants. Pablo is what you get if (the late) Freddie Prinze and Jim Carey had a kid. Anybody can tell jokes and observational humour, but I haven't heard anyone that is better at: sound effects, dialects, skits and the ability to impersoninate a wide variety of Celebs and situations. This guy should really be more famous than he is now, someone FIRE his agent!!"
5,The Latino Leary.....,"Dude, if you don't already own this, PUT IT IN YOUR CART NOW!! This guy's one of the funniest people I've ever seen. His impersinations and sound effects are no different than experiencing the real thing. And if anybody didn't laugh at the Movie Previews track, they should be struck down by lightning for dissobeying the gods of comedy. Either that or the bug hasn't crawled out of your [behind] yet. BUY THIS NOW. Anyone who doesn't may have to deal with Pablo's Mexican girlfriend."
4,"Great live, I wish I had his performance from Gator Growl","This guy was hysterical when I saw him live at Gator Growl, wayy back in the day. So I picked up his CD because I was hoping to hear some new material. Some new, some old, but it was all really funny. The best part are his movie previews. I gave it 4 stars because it is far too short and, also, I heard him live and it was a lot better than this recording. Overall, really funny, but he is better live!"
3,Need to Read this!,"I have only heard clips from this CD but I know the problem. This CD was made a while back and his jokes are a bit better. BUT THE MAIN REASON YOU DONT WANT TO BUY THIS CD IS HE NEEDS TO BE SEEN. HIS COMEDY INTERLOCKS WITH VISUAL CUES AND LOOKS. ALTHOUGH YOU COULD LAUGH AT SOME OF HIS JOKES WITHOUT SOUND TOO. GET THE COMEDY CENTRAL DVD OR FORGET ABOUT IT. It's true, he needs new material. The 3 stars are b/c I know how funny he can be. Still one of my favorites. Good job last couple of years comedy central."
1,Knee to the Groin,"I bought this CD because it got a 5 star rating, and I was so disappointed. I realize it was recorded in 1997, but the jokes are totally obsolete and I didn't even crack a smile during the entire CD. Not funny at all."
1,Fleeting...,"Great comedy, like any great art, is great because it endures. George Carlin's material, for example, has endured for decades, and it will continue to endure; it will be as poignant fifty years from now as it is today.The problem with the comics who do impressions---comics like Francisco---is that their material has a shelf-life of about twelve minutes. Sixty years ago, if you did a good impression of Humphrey Bogart, you'd probably get a lot of laughs. But today, the same impression would be met with blank stares.The guy who does the movie preview voice today will not be the one who does them in the future, and likewise, in the future, that impression will have lost all its value, as no one will be familiar with the reference.Look ahead to the future: a new comic, doing a new impression of the new movie preview guy, getting a lot of laughs. And Pablo Francisco? Nobody's ever heard of him. His act has vanished into the eternal dusts of time."
2,chicco space recorder,"This product is JUNK!It is reccomended for ages 36 months to 4 yrs-----my son will be 4 in just 2 months----just right, right?---WRONG!!!!!The voice function to sound like yourself crapped out in less than 24 hours, and the microphone stopped functioning all together on the third day!!!!!!!"
1,for alien use only,"very poor quality for the price. could not understand any recordings using the ""effects"" buttons. the microphone cord doesn't look like it will last long. i returned all three that i bought."
4,"Awww, it's a rerun!","Well, it's the Kids in the Hall, so that means it's funny. However, when I saw that this pilot episode was being released after so many years, I expected to see material I hadn't seen before. This is not the case. I've already seen every one of these sketches, so I felt a little bit cheated. I don't know whether these are the actual versions that were cut into a later episode or whether the Kids performed them anew for the regular TV series. At any rate, it's all hilarious and I laughed at it all over again, hence the 4 star rating. However, if you already have the other Kids DVDs, there's not much reason to get this one, too."
2,Nothing like the orginal,"Like a lot of the other reviewers I was looking forward to this book because the first one was so good, but I was VERY disappointed. The thing that really bothered me was that it started in the 1980's and acted like they were the same age when we left them in the first book, in the 1960's. It made no sense. It might have been better if it picked up in the 1960's. This book really lost all the fun of the first. The glamour of the ""Hollywood"" lifestyle that existed in those times was the heart of the first book. Bringing the storyline into the modern age made it like any other Jackie Collins novel. It lost all of the Jacquline Susann Magic. I would have rather wondered what happened in the future than think of it the way Shadow of the Dolls portrays it.Bottomo line: If you are in the mood for more Jacqueline Susann, buy the other books that she actually wrote."
2,"Quick, I need a better Doll!","In 2002, can we really shock anybody anymore? This sequel tries to be as much trashy fun as the original and leaves the reader unimpressed. Nothing is shocking in this book. No twists come completely out of nowhere. Still to compare this book with the orginal is doing this book a great injustice. Still the ""shadow"" of Jacqueline Susann lingers and it is very hard not to compare the two works.Neely is still my favorite ... character and I love all the chapters with her. The contemporary setting didn't brother me, but why didn't the author leave the book in the orginal time period and work through the sexual haze of the 70's and the sobering early 80's? Did she feel it wouldn't sell? I felt sorry for the character of Anne Wells and her quest for love and in the end the book left me wondering if we can ever find a faithful true love? Do we ever have a second chance at true love? Near the end, I though ""Yes"" but by the end I'm questioning that answer. ..."
2,In the Shadow of the Valley,"When I finished Valley of the Dolls, I wasn't particularly hungry for a sequel, but I was a little curious about Lawrence's attempt at a follow-up. But why oh why did she have to fool with the time period? What may have been shocking left set in the sixties is pretty tame by today's standards. The whole charm of the original ""Dolls"" was directly related to the period in which it was set. Lawrence's ""Shadow"" is has nothing new to say, nothing you wouldn't find in any Jackie Collins novel. Stick to the original."
3,"Jackie's ""Shadow""? Hardly","Neither Barbara Seaman's bio of Jacqueline Susann, ""Lovely Me"", nor that of Ms. Susann's husband Irving Mansfield hint at there being any further, leftover material - why else was her first effort done in the early 1950's, ""Yargo"", dredged up in 1979? Nearly 30 years after Susann's death, Rae Lawrence without question casts a ""Shadow"" over its predecessor. Allegedly created using a ""recently discovered outline"", it would seem that Jackie Susann was as prescient as Nostradamos, predicting Xanax,the altered shape of Valium (it didn't always have a ""V"" carved out in the center), the PC, the need for safe sex, and more! There exist photographs of Jacqueline Susann working on outlines for her books - *She chalked various ""trees"" of people and events on large blackboards*, which makes the ""recently discovered outline"" claim highly questionable. In spite of all that, Ms. Lawrence does seem to have studied the Susann style and emulates it rather well throughout the book."
1,Missed Opportunity,"This could have been a great follow on. Characters we all love, story already developed. So what happened? The best plot turns were glazed over and the characters were never shown with any emotion. The author should have re-read the first novel a few more times and gotten the cadence and the plot turns and characters reactions to the turns down. This just came out as a poor poor follow up that left me wondering, why bother... If you need a beach book, go for the new Jackie Collins...this just does not cut it!"
5,RETURN OF THE DOLLS!!,"Wow. Neely, Lyon, and Anne are back in this summer's ... read. Although many years have passed since the origingal ""Valley of the Dolls"", Rae Lawrence proves that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Here we find Anne Welles realising that the past she thought she ran away from years ago will always be there to haunt her. Lyon is still the same playboy he always was, (not a good thing to be when you are married), and Neely O'Hara decides being a singer in the theatre isn't all that much--not when you can be a big star in Hollywood. All the vices, bitchery, and deception are there, with a couple of plot twists thrown in for good measure. I stayed up till three a.m., unable to put this book down until it was finished. And when it was finshed....I wanted MORE!! Hard-core ""Valley"" fans may be disappointed at the lack of shock and scandal in this volume, compared to the original, but it is no less satisfying for it."
4,The Best Sequel!,"I have read many mixed reviews about this book and people should lighten up. It's a very fun read. I must admit that I just read Valley Of the Dolls a few months ago and loved it. So this book came out just in time for me. It is hands down the best sequel I've ever read. For the uber Valley enthusiasts, no it's not as good as the orginal but it isn't supposed to be. I couldn't put it down. It was great revisiting Anne, Neely, Lyon and the rest and to see where their lives have gone. If you don't take it too seriously and have fun with it, this book is great. Let's remember that the original, albeit a great book, will not go down in history as a great work of literature. It was meant to be a fun, bitchy poolside kind of novel and the sequel is just the same."
1,Terrible; couldn't wait to put it down,I really loved the Valley of The Dolls. It was a novel that you could just NOT put down; a real page turner. This story on the other hand is very boring. Nothing to hold the reader's interest. I was especially offended by the Ted Turner/Jane Fonda comparison. I doubt that that was part of Jaqueline Susann's original outline. I also felt that the reappearance of Gretchen was a little far fetched as well.
3,In the Shadow of a Giant,"It's hard to follow up such a classic novel like Valley of the Dolls. Rae Lawrence keeps in the spirit of the original, though ""takes liberties"" with age, time and place. It's an entertaining read and follows the path of Anne Wells and Neely O'Hara as they go through their thirties (wink, wink) in the eighties and nineties. Marriages are broken and remade, the children left over from the original grow to be as dysfunctional as their parents and just as entertaining. And no one has forgotten the power of those wonderful, wonderful dolls.However, this sequel seems to be bastardized by the recent cult of wannabe Jacqueline Susann writers... The characters spend too much time navel-gazing in the Hamptons and not enough rising and falling as in the original. And with the ""liberties taken,"" it's easy to feel slighted as characters reminisce of the late seventies and early eighties.Overall it's decent, but check the book out from the library or buy it used..."
5,Great beach read!,"In the true style of the original, this sequel is a deliciously wicked read! Ms. Lawrence really took on a challenge by finishing Susann's unfinished manuscript, written just before her death. For readers not familiar with the first or those who forgot, it doesn't matter. Lawrence has updated the characters to fit the times, of course taking some very big liberties with age, etc. No matter, it works!This time, the story revolves around Anne and Neely, both trying to weather turbulent personal matters, age (they make 33-34 out to be ancient) and careers. Money and greed, of course, bring the two together after they split in the first novel. Alas, all is not neat and tidy! The story just oozes with sex, drugs, cat fights, ex-husbands, and skeletons coming out of the closet just to mention a few.Once again, we are reminded that Susann paved the way for today's greats like Jackie Collins. Congrats to Ms. Lawrence for bringing ""Shadows"" to life."
4,Fun Afternoon,"Of course it isn't Jackie...probably no one will ever even come close...but it was a kick just the same. Like visiting old friends with whom you've completely lost touch... Ms. Lawrence has managed to remain very true to the tone and style of the original, even with the liberties taken with the time frame."
5,awsome book,I love this book it was excellent her books r great so glad they had a update to the origina
2,I had to take some dolls just to get through this book,"I will start my review by saying I thoroughly enjoyed VOTD and was looking forward to seeing what happened to Anne, Neely, Lyon, and the rest of the gang. First off, there is an unexplained change in time. VOTD ended in 1964 with Anne Welles approaching 40 years old. SOTD begins in the late '80s with Anne in her mid-30s. What happened to 1964-1987? Anne as well as the other characters should have been 23 years older, not five years younger.Besides the errors in time, there are also name errors (Kevin Gillmore is now referred to as Kevin Gillian) and storylines that just don't ring true for any of the characters.A few devoted VOTD fans should have read this book first and offered their critiques to the author. At least some of the errors could have been corrected. I am not sure if anyone could have saved the plotlines. Overall a very disappointing read."
3,"Good, but not Jackie!","When I saw this book in stores, I wanted to read it. I hadn't even read Valley of the Dolls yet, but I had watched some of the movie and liked it. My mom had a copy of it so I read it. I took a long time to finish the 500 page novel, but I loved it! very daring! (for its time, anyway) Then I ordered the Shadow of the Dolls. I didn't really mind the age change or anything, but I found it more shallow that something Susann would write.Don't get me wrong, Rae Lawrence is a very talented writer from what I can tell, but she's just no Jacequeline Susann! She should have studied more into the way Susann writes and then wrote it. I guess it just can't compare to the original, to me anyway."
1,"Close, but no cigar.","While I appreciate that Rae Lawrence sought to warm the hearts of a public who missed Susann's original characters, this book (like ""Scarlet"", the ""sequel"" to ""Gone With the Wind"") is proof that some things are indeed best left alone. The characters in this work seem very flat, lacking the emotion, depth and vibrancy that made ""Valley of the Dolls"" such an enjoyable work.Anne, Neely, Lyon are all relegated to plots that are the fodder for typical romance novels that aspire to be good beach reading: adultery, Hollywood, death, a genre well done by someone like Jackie Collins. However, in Lawrence's text they seem only to be placed in these situations. The reader is given very little insight into any character's motivation or emotional reaction.And then there is the unfortunate ""second generation"" sub-plot.If you feel this is something you must read, please check it out of your local library. Your money will definitely be better spent elsewhere."
3,Mixed bag of nuts,"I bought and re-read Valley of the Dolls right before I bought the sequel so I could continue smoothly into the storyline of the characters. I must say, it was strange to have them jump into the modern world from 30 years earlier. But it was not just that...some of the characters did not ring true to their former selves in the previous VOD. Anne, for instance, becomes nasty at times and vindictive - I could NEVER see her saying some of the comments that the sequel has her saying. And I do not think Susann would have had Lyon's character playout the way he does. However, living in south Florida and reading this in the summer by the water, it was a fast, non-serious read and nice to find out what ended up happening to the characters. If you want the creative, smart, fun, ""before-its-time"" storyline of Valley of the Dolls, then look elsewhere."
3,Shadow of the Dolls or Ho Hum,"I must admit I was anxiously awaiting a sequel of sorts of the Neely O'Hara/Anne Wells saga. I thought this would be it but let's be realistic - Rae Lawrence is NO Jackie Susann. Also, I found a misprint - Kevin Gilmore in the original Dolls is listed as Kevin Gillian in Shadow......However, it was fun to read about Neely, Anne and Lyon Burk again - even the addition of the offspring was kind of fun. I felt melancholy when Jennifer North was mentioned - if you're looking for a great sequel to a fantastic book - this is NOT it."
1,Zzzzzzzero stars. Even more boring than an Oprah book.,"I'm a big Jacqueline Susann fan, so I was excited when I first heard about this book. I got the audio edition and listened to it while I drove to work each day. I tell you, it's a wonder I didn't careen off the road in a deep sleep while listening to it! Although it doesn't suffer from the twisted, gnarly phrasing of modern ""litahdeddy"" fiction, it, however, lacks the ballsy punches of its prequel.First it jerks around with the timeline, hacking twenty years off the characters' ages, and then it delivers a story with the impact of a 1962 Frigidaire commercial cowering under the scrutiny of a rigid TV censor!I mean, what was it afraid of? It had all the background it needed--the original VD!--to deliver a truly dishy and still insightful story. And, yet, the author chose not to do that. Huh?!The book brought me to tears, because it BORED me to tears."
3,Shadow of a Book,"This book is fun - in an eating-cotton-candy-is-fun sort of way. Having read the original, I was greedy for information on Anne and Neely and Lyon and I got plenty of that, but gosh, did no one in this book feel anything? They went through some tough times - with no tears, hardly a moist eye. Pages and pages of really shallow people. It was as though Ms. Lawrence ran a butter knife across the heads of her characters, then tried to pass them off as real people. Even Lyon, the cad, deserved a little depth."
3,we couldn't get it to work,Hubby really wanted to play this game but no matter what i did we couldn't get it to work. So it just sits on the shelf
2,Too much of the same kind,"Although I LOVE Jelly Belly's I was very disappointed (and tired) of the cherry, cinnamon, and occasional watermelon thrown in. I would be a monthly buyer of belly flops if they could be more mixed."
3,4 bags no variety,"I love Jelly bellys. So when I saw an offer for buy 3 bags of flops and get one free, I was excited. Unfortunately between the 4 bags, eight pounds, there were only about 8 flavors. Next time I will just buy premium jelly beans."
4,"I love Jelly Belly jelly beans and these were cheaper than the ""perfect"" ones.","It was great to get jelly belly beans in the form of ""flops"" because I saved money by getting the ones that were a little misshaped or didn't have the jelly belly imprint on them. The only drawback is that you never know what flavors you will get. So if you luck out and get your favorites in the bag, you'll really enjoy them. I happened to get a bag mostly full of the red cherry ones, and I'm not a real fan of that, so I can't give this a full 5 stars in my review. But if I had gotten a bag with more of my favorites in them, I would definitely be raving about this product."
4,bellyflops are no flop,"We love to get the belly flops - our teenagers take them to parties and are greatly entertained having everyone try different flavors. Everyone has a favorite flavor and we eventually find someone who likes the ones others didn't, so few go to waste. We buy enough that there is always an amazing mix even if a few bags are not quite the mix we like..."
1,Not a Happy Camper,"I ordered 3 bags so I could get a good assortment. WRONG All 3 bags were the same, sticked together like a brick. No joke! it took 1 1/2 weeks to reach me. Grandchildren were upset since they didn't get theirs. They were too sticky and messy. Spent almost $30 on this. Will not order in the hot months again. But my son loved them. LOL sticked together, sticky and all. What can I say he loves Jelly Bellies anyway he can get them. Unless it's butter popcorn and coffee flavorers. All in all I was disappointed in the quality of the goods when I received them."
3,Flip for flops,"I ordered two bags of the flops. I agree with some of the other posters in saying the variety isn't that great. One bag had mostly dark colored beans....cappuccino, chocolate pudding, and some kind of grape-ish one. However, I was extremely excited to see that there were some smoothie blends included since those aren't that easy to find. I also liked how they had some sassy sours. I would say, from the two bags, 75% were the three flavors I mentioned above, but the other 25% were a good variety.Plus, all beans were extremely fresh, which was a huge bonus."
2,Not what we expected,"We received a 2 pound bag and 80% was chocolate pudding beans,10% was coffee and Very few other flavors. I expected more of a variey since jelly belly's has HUNDREDS of flavors. Unfortunatly our family does not care for chocolate pudding or coffee flavored beans, so this was a waste of time and money for us. I don't think we will be ordering this again."
4,hot sizzlen,I ordered 8 bags and more than half of 6 bags were hot sizzlin cinnamon and cappacino - usually toss those two flavors but this time everyone at my office scored.. I will purchase again and hope for more varity.
1,not in canada?,Very disappointing to keep receiving emails with this stuff and not being able to order in Canada
3,popcorn flops,we bought the jelly belly flops and most were popcorn flavored which i absolutely abhor..would recommend just buying flavors you know instead of the hodgepodge mix.
2,Belly Flops are not that great of a value,"I love Jelly Bellys, I am certifiable addict. I originally thought Belly Flops were a terrific value, I ordered 2 bags and with shipping the total was almost $22. I was at Costco the other day and happened to stumble upon a plastic tub of Jelly Bellys which were not defect and their total price for 4 pounds, the same equivalence as 2 two-pound bags of flops, was about $15. I'd recommend getting them at Costco if thats possible--more variety, better taste, and you don't have to pay for shipping, or wait. It's a win win!"
2,All the same....,I ordered 8 bages- yes 8 bags a couple of months ago and they were all the same...i really wanted variety... I was disappointed. I am a huge belly flop fan so I was beyond excited when I learned I could order them online...now I am too scared to order more if there is no variety... :(
2,Not worth it,Not worth buying they were too stuck together and all were mostly the same flavors. You are better off to buy the real ones
2,Unfortunate extra ingredient - live ants,"Unlike most of the other low reviewers, I got a pretty good variety of intact jelly bellies. Inside the sealed bag, however, were four live ants crawling all over the candy. Yuck. I inspected the bag for holes and couldn't find any, so I think the problem was there pre-shipping."
1,Very disappointed!,"I ordered and received 2 bags of belly flops thinking that I would get a good variety. I was so disappointed!! I got 2 bags of an identical mixture - 60% cappucino, 35% french vanilla and the other 5% was sour grape. It was a waste of money and wouldn't be interested in ordering Belly Flops again. The advertisement for Belly Flops suggest you'll get a good variety, however, the opposite is true."
2,yucky pear and coffee beans,I got a bad selection. Around 70% was coffee or cappucino and pear. I hate THOSE FLAVORS :( WON'T BUY AGAIN.
3,You get what you pay for,"There was less of a variety in this bag. The shapes were interesting. :) There seemed to be a preponderance of one flavor (root beer) which wasn't a lot of fun, but they were really good for the money. Personally, I'd rather pay the extra money to get ALL the delicious flavors. -Jelly Belly Addict"
1,ouch,for belly flops at $8.00/bag.... you've got to be kidding... they should be 1.00/bag... remember...they are trying to get rid of these. They are defective and not made of gold. and then after reading the comments where you order 2 bags and get the same exact thing... that's bad.
5,"At last, Belly flops online!","Finally, no more begging my niece in California to send me my Belly Flops! I do wish there were more strawberry-flavored Flops; but the assortment is plenty varied, and I love 'em. Thanks for making these yummy treats available online, J.B.!"
2,Too pricey,I know that you're taking a chance - after all they are flops but I think they're are overpriced.
2,CANT GET THESE IN ENGLAND,"I get emails tempting me to buy jellybeans which I love, but you dont ship them to England!"
2,BULK JELLY BEANS,"AN EXCEEDING;LY TASTY TREAT AT ANY PRICE, A REAL VALUE IN BULK ""FLOPS""; PRESIDENT REAGAN HAD THE PERFECT CHOICE JELLY BELLIES ON HIS DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE."
1,Immensely,I eat Jelly Bellys all the time. Why can't we order these in Canada?? This hardly seems fair to send out these emails to us when they aren't available to us at all. Totally totally not fair!! Please hurry and make them available to all of us who recieve your emails!!!
3,Belly Flops Reveiw,Some of the beans do test great however many of the jelly beans taste the same to me.
3,Disappointing,"with over 40 flavors of jelly beans, it is hard to believe that they only had mess ups on five flavors."
4,good value,"I bought three bags at once for my desk candy jar. Each bag had a different mix, but each had about 25 percent of one flavor. We were happy about the extra chocolate pudding, but the big batch of pear was not so popular. I'll be buying more when these run out."
2,Only get one bag,I got two bags and they were exactly the same. They say they will try to give you different bags but that wasn't the case. If you are going to buy it just get one.
4,Fun with Belly Flops,"I put a jar of Belly Flops on my kitchen counter instead of my regular Jelly Bellies. Everyone who pulled out misshapen ones wanted to know if they were Jelly Bellies because of their shapes. It was fun watching the light go on when I informed them that they were Belly Flops! They're disappearing faster than usual because there are so many different flavors to try!They did seem just a little bit stale, hence my 4 star rating. Perhaps they should be offered 4 times a year with flavors and colors to match the season? Then they wouldn't have a chance to get stale!"
4,Not bad,"After reading the other reviews, I was very worried about ordering this. But, it was much better than I anticipated. I had all different colors and flavors. It seemed that the resaon the ones I received were flops was that they seemed to be connected. Two or three same colored (flavored) jelly beans that were attached. I did have to sort these out since they wouldn't work in my jelly belly machine, but otherwise I was very happy with the product. I still think that the cost was extremely high though. I don't know if I would purchase these again for that reason."
4,flops are the best,I just discovered the jelly belly flops and think they are the best thing out there for a single mom struggling to get by. We love Jelly Belly's but they are pretty costly. The flops are a bargin and taste the exact same. They may look funny but we get a ton of laughs eating them.
2,Not For Me,I understood the selection would be random but I was not prepared for 99 percent dark beans. I love Jelly Belly but the flops are something I will pass on.
3,Better The First Time,"We have ordered Belly Flops two times now (1 bag then a 2 bag order). The first bag was great and had lots of different flavors!! The second order of 2 bags had like 4 or 5 flavors in both of them. The whole bag!! We were so disappointed because we sent one to family in France and had to tell them, sorry that there were only 4 flavors. We are a little hesitant to order again."
2,Belly Flops flopped,Simply too many coffee flavored belly flops--unless you like coffee flavor. Won't purchase again. Other flavors good and it was fun to eat unusually shaped jelly beans
1,thia is no useful,"what is this? this is not a good book at all. I don't understand why it gets high mark, maybe it got the good rating from the author associates???? From the whole book, I would say about 3 pages that are useful, but we can get these 3 pages material from other real good book. So dont waste your hard earn money on this book."
1,talk about changing one's mind!,"I bought this book after having been intrigued by a documentary about Fran Lebowitz in which she came across as a lovable curmudgeon always ready with one-line rejoinders. Boy was I disappointed by the book! It turns out that Lebowitz's so-called humor is paper thin, and wears out very quickly once one moves from an on screen scene lasting a few seconds to the length of even a short ""essay"" (if one can use that lofty term for the chapters of this book). Lebowitz is simply irritating, her observations about New York and modern life (which are dated anyway, since the book was last updated more than fifteen years ago) are superficial, generic, humorless, and inexplicably condescending. What a waste of paper (or electrons, if you get it as an e-book). According to the documentary Lebowitz has been stuck in a writer's block for more than two decades. Thank goodness for that!"
1,Yuck!,"Oh geez -- Fran is not funny. Lots of sarcasm, but no whit. Now I know why we don't see much of her. This is though a wonderful nostalgic look back at one of the self-annointed celebrity-bohemians of the 60's and 70's. The ""cool"" writers who loved to name-drop; and sponge free eats, weekends in the Hamptons, and limo rides, off those with money and social status - while proclaiming their elitist snobbery of those same benefactors. I guess both fed off each other. The hipsters got ideas for their mocking articles, while the socialites got a real 'New York writer' to adorn their parties. (""Isn't she funny - and cute?!""). I think if you're looking for some good social commentary with talent of that era -- seek out material of Mort Sahl, or at least a Jean Shepard. I had high expectations, but this book is dull and boring. What's all the ballyhoo about? She wasn't funny when I lived in New York, and she ain't funny out here in the sticks either."
2,"keep on milkin' it, fran","For twenty years now, Lebowitz has been keeping her name in the limelight on the basis of these quaint humor piees. From this molehill of work, she has built a mountain of a career. Too bad there never was much 'there' there. Where's this Bonfire-of-the-Vanities-like epic she says she's been slaving over? Sorry, but she ain't no Ralph Ellison. Oh, and am I the only one who's noticed she could pass as Geoffrey Rush's twin?"
3,"Really enjoyed ""Public Speaking"" documentary; book ain't so great","I'm new to Fran Lebowitz and love her. . . in person. I guess her 'special-ness' comes from watching her say what she says, not reading it. She should take her act on the road regularly, because people need to hear what she has to say. She's breathtakingly honest, which our society doesn't always find refreshing. But I loved her style and have 'stolen' a couple phrases for my own use!"
2,New Purchase,Purchased for a Spring Quarter 2013 seminary class. Other than that have not begun to read it. Will know more at the end of the course.
3,Isle of Fury,A wonderful light read with bits of New England history weaved thoughout. Form Machias ME to Boston you travel with the charactors as they piece together the clues. At times I felt as if I was there with them. I enjoyed it very much.
1,"Amazon has to pack this ""Better""","My family and I love Felix Lingonberries. We thought we could get this large container and share it with others in the family. The first one shipped to us the bottom of the tub was split and it was leaking in the box. I let Amazon know that we couldn't use the lingonberries since I felt they were contaminated in shipping. They sent another container and this box was actually dripping. Until Amazon figures out how to ship this tub without it breaking I would hold off on these. Great product, Lousy packing!!"
1,"Felix Lingonberries in Sauce, 11-Pound Tub",Very disappointed that we did not receive this product as it was damaged in shipping.
4,Excellent,"As one only slightly familiar with Steinbeck and Rickets and stories of their friendship, I found Mr. Tamm's book incredibly well researched and full of the stories and details I was hoping to find. I was so intrigued that these major intellectuals, that is Steinbeck and Joseph Campbell, found this much lesser known personality of Ed Rickets as the galvanizing force in their mutual friendships, but more so as a major influence in the shaping of their personal philosophies. I wonder if that is why Steinbeck is so compelling since people know his life was surrounded with people as interesting and elusive as Ed Rickets. This is one of those true stories, it seems, that is larger than fiction. If you, too, are curious, you will not be disappointed in Mr. Tamm's book."
3,Ebb tide,"I was very much disappointed in this book. The writing seems borderline hyperbolic and lightweight, almost like it's in a travel magazine, or weekly news magazine. The material is largely a rehash of published information, and does not capture the feeling of that time. The work seems padded and lacking in substance as a result. I kept wondering how it could possibly drag on after the first couple chapters. For anyone who has read Steinbeck's books, or Ricketts's books, or the Hedgepeth book on Ed this is unnecessary, but maybe a newbie will be encouraged to go for sterner, more genuine stuff as a result of reading this."
1,Piranhas? Where are you?,"Wow. I was looking for piranhas here, but did anyone find any yet? We have watched over half the movie and not figured out the meaning yet - and DEFINITELY have not seen any piranhas. Not a good movie."
2,Minority opinion,"I found the use of the ficticious classroom to be very distracting, plus, I thought the book started too slow. On the other hand, I don't have a better book to recommend. A five star rating seems a little lofty."
5,Explained for the least computer knolaged person,"The Basics of this book are simple, the author knows what he is talking about when he try's to explain objects to you unlike other books that tell you what to do and then expect you to know what you are doing this book looks at the point of view as if you don't he explains with an amount of patients that's anonamaml This is a very well detailed book that I think will teach even the most uneducated person to program"
5,Learn to Program with Visual Basic,"A thorough communication of how to program with Visual Basic. It is written in an informative but non boring manner so that you can learn and like to learn it. It is so well written, I could use for the text book at the ZDU class. Highly recommended."
4,Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6,"This is a good book for beginner Visual Basic 6.0 developers. Some people do not like the ""interactive dialog"" but this conversion between John Smiley and his make-believe students helps to ease the stress of learning. This book was the first of many book that I read while trying to upgrade my Visual Basic skills from Visual Basic 5 to Visual Basic 6."
1,"Good for learning VB, but not for learning about programming","If you are a busy person, you work a lot with programmers and you need a general understanding of programming, this is not the book for you.If you have time on your hands, and you want to learn VB, this could be the book for you.After I bought this book I realised I was fooled by the title. It should be called 'Programming in Visual Basic for beginners'. The point of this book is to teach you to program in VB6, not to teach you the basics of programming using VB as an example language. While I can understand that the verbose classroom approach may appeal to some, I found it patronising and time wasting. I eventually bought 'Sams Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 Hours' by Greg Perry which gives a concise summary of programming basics, an overview of the most common languages, and exercises to drive home the lessons. Exactly what I was after."
5,Great Programming Starter Book !!!,"I have tried learning programming from a variety of books in the past. Most books I found, taught procedure without the whys or whens to use a procedure. So, I found I could write one heck of a For,,,Next Loop procedure, but never knew when or why to use it. Professor Smiley teaches you not only the way to learn VB, but he teaches you the various whens and whys of programming. No Beginning programming student should be without this Book in his/her library. I strongly endorse this book and only hope Professor Smiley will teach a course at a location near me or write another book to advance what I learned from this book. Thank you Professor Smiley !!!"
5,this book is excellent,"For many years I wrote software in Fortran and later in C for mainframes and later PC's as part of my work. I retired 8 years ago. Recently I decided I wanted to write for Windows using Visual Basic. I have bought several introductory books and generally have been disappointed and frustrated. It's easy to reproduce the code and get it to work but understanding it is a different matter.Then I discoverd John Smiley's book and have been delighted. It is brilliant. For example, the explanation of the debugger, not only for errors but for tracing your code, is excellent. The format, being in a class room, has been very well thought out and is comforting for the beginner. Congratulations!"
1,Strange format,"I've never seen a self-help text written in this format. It tries to place you in a classroom situation, as if people sitting around you are asking questions. I found this method very hard to learn by (I kept waiting for someone to ask the question I needed an answer to!) and would be especially hard to allow this book to serve as a reference point in the future."
2,If you like to read a transcript for a class--buy this book,"The material is here, it just takes a while to get to it. I tend to prefer not reading all the ""he said, she said, there were no more questions so we went on, etc"" I like to get to the point and get on with it. If you don't mind that then this book has intro information on Visual Basic and can help you. It just takes are really long time to get there."
1,Too wordy!,"It's a horrible book! I can't tell you how many times I read the words ""after the students got back from their break"" and other useless words. It's poorly organized. You have to re-read chapter after chapter if you want to refer back to a subject. There are much better books - I just ordered Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Step-By-Step and Visual Basic 6 Unleashed, Professional Reference Edition."
5,Yep. It was good!,"Good book. Yep. Buy it.The best part was about Visual Basic. Exciting as hell.Just like the TV commercial where the Yoga students imagine that they are using E-trade, this book is ""Sooooo relaxing""!"
3,This is all a hoax,"I have never read the book, but i think the author came here and posted al these reviews."
4,Solid book,"This book is definately for a beginner, like myself, and teaches the basic principals for visual basic very early on. However, I found his ""hold your hand"" style of teaching a little too slow for me and opted out towards the end of the book. Don't get me wrong, this is a great book and teaches a lot, but it wasn't written exactly for me. I'd suggest this to a beginner with no programming experience whatsoever. However if you do have some experience, even a little, it may be a bit too easy."
5,Learn to Program with VB,If you would like to learn VB programming simply purchase John Smileys Learn to Program with VB. It is comprehensive and will give you a strong foundation in Visual Basic programming. Most points are covered several times to reinforce the concepts. I recommend reading it from cover to cover.
4,User needs to get used to the format,"The book is truly basic beginning with common computer information that many users may skip. I found the book to be easy to deal with since it went slowly from one topic to the other. But I must admit that having to read it like a novel, with ""Laura said"" and ""David asked"" and to review what would be a classroom dialogue, was frustrating. I much prefer the style where a topic is introduced and information available in other than question-and-answer fashion. This aspect made the book a bit harder to follow, but it may be simply my preference."
5,Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6,"I found this book to be a refreshing and welcome change to the boredom encountered with most text books (in general). The book is not cluttered with unnecessary information like the ""history"" of programing. I later decided to take a college level class in VB6, and this book put me ahead of the class. Learn to Program with VB6 is a lot better than the text used in the class."
1,Drove me Nuts,Let me summarize my experience with this book.Blah Blah Blah *yawn* blah blah blah (150 pages later still no programming) blah blah blah... china shop... blah blah blah... students return from break... blah blah blah.Bought another book.The end
1,Don't waste your money or your time.,"I received the book and decided to send it back the same day. I know it says for absolute beginners but this is ridiculous. The book could have been cut down by a few hundred pages if the author would have cut out all the inane chatter. The classroom style of the book appealed to me until I read the first chapter. No class that I have been in was ever like that. It sounded like a VB6 class in Mayberry. That aside I think beginning programmers would be better served with a book that spent more time telling you about the features and how to's of VB6 instead of endless he said, she said, excellent point Billy, etc. Just get to the point and give the readers of the book a little credit. They may be absolute beginners but they are not 10 years old."
2,First VB book,"I found the use of a ficticious classroom to be distracting. Linda said this, Rhonda asked that along with ""that's a good question Linda"" statements in the book are not value added comments. I also had run time errors in the disk that came with the book. On the other hand, I don't have another VB book to compare this book to, since this was my first."
5,Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6,"I have been trying to teach myself programming with Visual Basic and have purchased several books. I came across this one and thought why not. Maybe this one will have that little bit of information that will tie it all together for me. This is a wonderful book. I find myself feeling as if I'm in the class room. So far, most of my questions are answered before I finish the chapter. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone beginning."
2,Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6,"Excellent people to deal with, will always check with them first. I rate this seller 6+stars. He went above and beyond other normal sellers to accomodate the customer. He is very pleasant to work with and extreemly cooperative. His Customer service was more than excellent. I strongly recomment this site to everyone! He is a man of his word, which you don't find anymore."
4,Effective teaching technique,"Mr. Smiley uses the approach of solving real-world programming problems to guide beginners through the world of Visual Basic operations. The book is beautifully written, and I found myself able to easily identify with some of the people mentioned. All in all a good buy if you're wanting to learn the basics (and some intermediate programming too)."
5,Outstanding! This book really TEACHES programming!,"I learned one programming language (REXX), and never thought I would be capable of learning another because it took me soooo long to finally ""get it"" with REXX. Then along came John Smiley's VB book. With this book, you do not need to know anything about typical ""Programming"" or ""Coding"". This book is written so well in laymens terms, that you can't help but learn to do real programming, just by reading it. The style used in this book actually puts you in a classroom with the author, and makes you feel like one of his students which in turn actually makes it fun to read. Not the normal ""techie"" book, that you have to labor to get through. I will buy John's other books, and I know I will learn! Thanks!"
5,"A definite ""BUY IT"" !!!!","While most books jump right in, throwing terms at you that you dont understand, this one does not. For the absolute beginner like myself the book has proven to be very valuable. It builds you up slowly giving you a foundation for the programming knowledge that it is about to give you. Not neccessarily for the experienced VB programmer, but very useful for someone who knows little or nothing. Hey, I bet my mom could learn VB with this book ;-)"
4,A great book for beginners,"John Smiley's book is really great for beginners and for those who love litterature and stories.. It's fun reading the book, as well as instructive..I recommend this book for a beginner to programming"
1,Irritating,"I may be alone in my assessment of this book.As someone with just a Basic programming background (and that some 20 years ago), I found this book incredibly irritating. Smiley never got beyond the most basic concepts.The convention of being a student in a programming class may have made for an entertaining read for some, but for me it was like talking on the phone with someone who stutters: I wanted to reach through the pages and get him to spit out something meaningful without having to read through 25 pages to cover a minute quantity of information. These 700+ pages of, ""There were no other questions, so I said that prior to taking a break I wanted to talk about the flower box I had displayed on the classroom projector,"" drove me nuts.This book was a complete waste of money!The SAMS Visual Basic in 21 Days was no picnic, but I learned more in the first 100 pages than I did in Smiley's entire 5 pound book."
5,"For absolute beginners, it's the best there is.","For someone with virtually no programming experience, I have to say that this is the best book in its field. At last, a book that gives clear and understandable explanations of all those things that you're ashamed to have to ask or that other books assume are already known. I've now bought two other books in the series on the strength of this one."
5,The one and only TRUE beginners book!,"This book reads like a novel. I am in the process of re-reading the book for the second time. I started a VB course at the local college this summer, and while ""cruisin'the web"", I saw the review of this book. I have not looked back at the purchase of this book. If you have never even seen VB then this book is for you. I will purchase the rest of Smiley's book series for the duration of school as a supplement."
5,Student,"Very good book for someone who has never programmed. If you have taken courses before, start higher up the latter. The author did not mean this for you. He has other other books more fit for you, but if you're just starting, this is a good one. The disk has programs from the book and a limited copy of Visual Basic. I think the only difference is that it does not have a Help file. That is what you have the book for. Good luck."
4,Kudos to Mr. Smiley,"Reading this book felt a little like reading a ""Magic School Bus"" book to my daughter, with all the quotes from the kids in class. And the author was a little corny at times. But you don't mind because you know he really is teaching this stuff, not just throwing it out there. Kudos to Mr. Smiley."
3,A bit too basic for Visual Basic,"If you think you really want to have a go at VB and want to learn fast, (maybe your the type who buys a computer book and devours it) then you may want to look elsewhere. While well written and entertaining, I was looking for something where I wouldn't get a page of filler for every page of content. On the flip side, if you don't want a text book and you really want everything spelled out, you may really enjoy it."
1,Grossly Padded,"It is not that the author doesn't know his subject -- the trouble with this book is that fouyr-fifths is padding. There are unbelievable questions from imaginary students, internal thinking of the teacher, and endless dopey conversations. All of the padding is no help, and blows the book up to 774 pages from a useful 150. The claim is that the book is for absolute beginners, but unless your idea is beginning by reading conversations that never did and never will take place, buy something shorter and better."
5,The only book a non-programmer needs to get started in VB,"I went through several different books that claimed they would teach me VB prior to reading this one. None of them did much more than confuse me, as they assumed knowledge that I didn't have. John Smiley's approach to this book is quite simply, spectacular. The instruction reads like a novel set in his classroom, and the students ask every stupid question that pops into your head while trying to grip the lesson. This approach makes the reader feel like maybe he can learn this, and makes it fun. I wish John Smiley would write a book on Java!"
4,"Blah, Blah, Blah. NO Way Man, Not This Book ! ! !","If you can't stand the, boring old, above your head, approach that most computer book have, then this book is for you. The author brings you into his lively class and makes you fell like your were really there. It's like reading a novel. Short-comings are very few and by the publishing Co.; but it does not interfere with the actual learning."
1,Not very helpfull,"The usefull information in this book could be condensed into about 50 pages. Most of the book is fictitious conversations between students and instructor and serves as filler. You will not be proficiant at VB after reading this book. This books not only asumes no prior programming experience, but apparently no prior knowledge of Windows as well. For example, this book provides instruction on how to create a new folder in Windows. Unless you are truly new to computers, I think this book would be a disapointment."
5,Excellent source for the beginning VB programmer,"As a former student of Professor Smiley, I have read his book. I find that it is typical of his books. In this book, he presents examples and projects that are laced with his great teaching style and humor. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to become a programmer in Visual Basic 6.0. Since being a student of Professor Smiley, I've gone on to owning my own software company. Do yourself a favor and read this book. You won't be sorry! It is excellent! Thank you Professor Smiley!"
4,Found this book to be very easy to work with.,"Being a main frame programmer for years, learning to program VB6 was having to have a change in thinking. I found this book and it's narrative approach very easy to make the transition. I was really impressed that when emailing Mr. Smiley with a question he responded right away. I would suggest that anyone that wants a straight forward approach to learning VB6 to try this book"
4,Works for Criminals Too,"There is a point in this book where the author states that this is not about criminal thinking; but as someone who works in a men's prison as a counselor, I can tell you this is SPECIFICALLY the kind of criminal thinking we try to address in cognitive thinking therapy groups.There are different levels of criminality. And some very serious criminals are never caught and arrested. If someone's inner brat is out of control, trust me, they are engaged in criminal behavior.I would recommend this book to anyone working with criminal thinking on any level."
2,Too Basic,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said ""The author scratches surfaces, without really covering anything in any depth."" This book is more of a beach-read. Lots of fluff and very little depth. You can find most information just by doing an internet search."
3,Why the Amazon site is better than the app...,"I made the mistake of buying this book via the Amazon iPhone app, which provided much less information than the website - lesson learned. I was looking for a book to help deal with my problems of procrastination, and sure this might touch on that in some way, but mostly its about people who need to deal with losing their tempers, over-eating, and not taking responsibility for their actions - not what I was looking for. I only read a few pages into before realising how wrong for me this book is and am now looking to return it and get something different. Basically, if you have problems with overreacting in stressful situations or escaping from emotionally salient situations via food/alcohol/etc then this may be for you (I haven't read all of it to know if its any good) but if you are just looking for something relating to procrastination, this is NOT the book for you."
5,Great resource!,"I really enjoyed this book and its insights into the norms and mores of the time when Jesus walked the earth. Being American, most of the material regarding everyday life in the Middle East at that time is somewhat foreign to me, my way of thinking and my upbringing. This book will help clear up difficulties encountered in the Gospels in the areas of: honor and shame, individual versus group, social status, kinship and marriage and what is considered clean and unclean. It is written in a relaxed, easy style and is a great resource for studying the life and times of Jesus. I have made room for this fine work on my shelves so that it will be at my fingertips when I need a first century reality check. -- Moza"
5,Must Read,Malina's volume is a must for anyone who intends to exegete the New Testament. Students of the Bible will benefit greatly from the material because it introduces one to a world unlike our own.
5,Getting Inside the New Testament Social World,"In this 2001 book, Malina systematically treats the culture of the New Testament world by contrasting it with contemporary Western culture. He organizes his presentation around a series of core Judean culture traits. His in-depth coverage draws on constructs from cultural anthropology, making it helpful to have had an introductory course in this field. For this reason, this book is a more challenging read than was his 1993 title, 'Windows on the World of Jesus'. The earlier book is written in a more accessible style for the non-specialist reader. Malina has as his underlying objective in both of these books to make the reader appreciate the great distance between his own contemporary experience of social reality and that of 1st century Judeans. He believes that without applying such a perspective, the reader is prone to misinterpret what he reads in the New Testament, as if it were taking place in our own time."
3,Half very good; half so-so,"Reading this was like reading two different books. One was a retrospective of the women's movement from the '50s to the '90s. It didn't capture my interest, and in fact I sped through several chapters only half paying attention. The other, and far more compelling book within a book, was Ms. Fleming's late-in-life quest to become a mother. I felt her anguish with each failed procedure and rooted her on even though I knew the outcome. I wish she had stuck to that instead of more or less blaming feminism for her delayed maternal instincts. All in all, a good read, but not great for that reason."
3,LOVE IN FRANCE OVER 8 CENTURIES,"Joseph BarryFrench Lovers:From Heloise & Abelard to Beauvoir & Sartre(New York: Arbor House, 1987) 352 pagesThe history of several famous French couples.Very interesting reading."
5,all time favorites,"I checked this book out of the library many years ago when it was first published and I was still a young woman. Over the years I thought about it often and decided I needed to have a copy of it in my personal library. It is a book that appeals to the romantic intellectual in me. History, biography, French culture, romance and fine writing. Treat yourself to a deliciously satisfying read. A book I recommend often to intelligent sensitive friends looking for something out of the ordinary."
3,'New Version' is just misleading,"This album was originally released back in 1985; it's in fact David Foster's 1st album, recorded in Los Angeles between 1982 and 1983; some tracks have been made famous by other artists (like ""Hard To Say I'm Sorry"" by Chicago).This is NOT a compilation, just an album named after the last track on the CD (which is the only non-instrumental one), with Richard Marx on backup vocals!"
2,"not too bad.., satisfactory , just okay","... whats the difference between the new and old version of this album? Is the old version of this album still available? If so, pls help me to get the cd ."
4,Well written and informative.,"I really like this helpful/hintful book. Many books of this type are arcane in nature or full of *hints* that most everybody knows by now. However, this book is worth twice the price. This well written and organized book lets you be creative with Windows 9x, but, helps trouble shoot as well."
2,Packing problems--cheated on weight,"The product is good--I have had three orders so far. The problem is with the manufacturer's credibility. One box was much lighter when I picked it up even though it was closed when I examined it. It was about 200g instead of 500g with sugar cubes freely moving on a bottom of the box. I have no idea what happened and it is impossible to report it to Amazon--missing links, circular instruction, no phone numbers, no customer support links. The buttons on most pages, even on Returns page are ""Continue Shopping""."
2,Price Gouging,"I started buying these about 6 years ago, the price was always around $4 a box. Now they want over $6!! My most recent order was early in 2011, and it will be my LAST. There are plenty of other Demerara sugar brands out there selling for far less. Save your hard earned money and buy one of those brands. Paying $2 more per box just to have square cubes is insane in this economy."
3,Could be more informative,"I have Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) and hoped this would help me learn more about it. I have had a very hard time finding out much of anything about TD on the internet & even most Doctors know little to nothing about it.If you don't know anything about TD this book will give you the basics.However, I was a little disappointed in the lack of in-depth information.It seems like they took a little bit of information & references and then repeated them several times.I am hoping they will come out with a newer, updated version that is more thorough & with much more information."
4,Almost 5!,"Explore the philosophy of progressive, controversial author Daniel Clement Dennett as he takes you through a tour of cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Fundamental analyzation of the human, animal and silicon mind. Delve deep into philosophy of thinking, then come back and build an intelligent robot!"
2,Ehh,"Begins with a different approach, and starts fun, then it derails. And it doesn't really care about the characters. I'd go more in depth, but I have a lot to do. Sorry I blind bought this one."
3,"Decent Horror Flick - But too ""Jumbled""","Overall, not a bad horror flick. There are some parts of very solid gore, and a couple genuinely quality horror moments. The ""clown"" part in the beginning was solid. There are some ""holes"" in the plot, and overall the plot is jumbled. Bouncing from sub-plot to sub-plot was confusing, and made the movie seem pieced together.Not a great flick, but if you have a chance, it's worth a watch."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! [...],"I made a big mistake with this one. I decided to judge the DVD by it's cover and while it looked like it would be awesomely cheesy, it wasn't. It was just weird and kinda boring. Whatever credibility this movie had was defiantly destroyed by the horrible ending. I wouldn't waste my time with this if i were you."
4,"Great actresses, sub-par material...","This is a slick production with three actresses who deserve a better film. The villain is fairly benign and doesn't incite fear in the viewer. Distinguished only by his evil laugh, there is nothing that is terribly frightening about him. However, strong production value and the filmmakers' sense of style and plotting lend itself to this entertaining flick, even though there are many plot holes and incongruous scenes. Check it out if you want a movie to burn an hour and a half of your time. But don't expect a brilliant piece of horror."
4,"4 stars, original, solid and scary","This film was such a breathe of fresh air after seeing some of the junk that's been distributed in the last ten years. It's scary, original and yes, cheesy and fun. I really enjoyed this film, and the plot wasn't too bad either. The 'big chasing' wasn't as scary as I'd hoped but the clostrophobic and unsettling situations he puts his victims in was very nerve wrecking. I especially love the scene involving the room with clowns. When she tells the children's mother that the life size clown on the rocking chair freaks her out, the mother says, we don't have a lifesize clown...scary!Seriously, it sounds cheesy, but this movie was really good. I give it an 89 percent...good stuff. Very good stuff."
3,A Good Bad Movie,This movie was actually pretty good. The first 2/3 of the movie was entertaining and kept me guessing. The last third was predictable and didn't really use two of the three main characters as much as they could have. Overall the movie was pretty good and the acting was pretty good. One of the villains was hilarious and did a great job. If you can pick up this movie cheap its worth the watch.
2,The Cover drew me in but the film didn't deliver,"This movie is not about killer clowns! I like those type movies and thats why I bought this. I then thought it would be like saw, which I do not like those, but it was not 100% like that, it is about a killer who kill the people whom made fun of him as a child. The first scenes with the Car/Convoy was good, and the part with the Clown/Baby sitter (although done before) was good, but the rest was just ok. One thing i will say is that the scene where the women are tied up and spread open I said to myself 'ok,this is ridiculous, but then I got a cool surprise' ! 2.5 / 5 Stars."
3,amusingly quite alright...,This is a simple 3-story-in-one movie. It's fun and really for those who loves their horror not to be taken seriously.

3,just peachy,The scent was very faint. Nice but faint. I would have liked a stronger peach scent. Oil goes on smooth with the easy moving roll on. Comes in a handy purse size. Product can be applied any where.
5,Gross and Funny.........,"Sam's makes his sister a special sandwich by slipping in little surprises such as snails and caterpillars. The book is shaped like a sandwich and each page is an ingredient (lettuce, tomatoes, eggs....) which open with flaps to show the surprise. My first graders think this book is hilarious and want me to read it practically on a daily basis."
4,A funny book,"I remember this book from when I was little and liked the details of how Sam tricked his sister with the sandwich. I once wrote in all the answers to the words(giving away all the answers) that before I gave the book away I had to cross the written-in answers out.That story was long, but I used to have it all memorized."
5,An absolute must have!,It is such a cute book. It captures the kids attention and they just love helping unfold the next part. It is sure to be a book that will be read over and over. Kids will remember this book into adulthood.
5,Sam's Sandwich,"This is a GREAT read aloud story for elementary age kids. It teaches rhyming, prediction, advanced vocabulary, etc... I attended a Readers Workshop for struggling readers a couple years ago and they showed us how to shred some paper in your hands before you read the story and at the end, after you've ""unfolded"" the story, pretend to take a bite. After a few chews, cough into your hand blowing shredded paper all over the kids. I wasn't sure how that would go over on a live audience so I tried it out on my son's 4th grade class... They LOVED it and asked me to do it again! I ordered this book to present to the teacher and class ~ the kids will be able to take it home and share it with their families. Thumbs up!"
1,"Extremely Disappointed, severely damaged product.","YIKES! There hasn't been an item that I have received from amazon.com that has not been EXACTLY as described. However-I was completely, and utterly disappointed when I received my book from THIS seller. The pop up book I received came in a flimsy floppy envelope. When I opened the package I wasn't surprised when I saw that my book no longer resembled anything REMOTLEY as described. Multiple pages had tears, and pop-up sections were completely ripped out of the book. NOTE TO SELF-never purchase a book from this seller ever again! It just might be worth spending an extra $20 dollars on a book that is legit and worth the two and half week wait. Do not, I repeat DO NOT waste your time or money with this seller."
3,Odd book,"I ordered this book for my Nephew. It's a funny book, but when it arrived I found the character Sam came across as a bit sinister. The book is not traditional in its binding and I'm not sure it would stand the test of time of little kid usage."
5,Big brother plays a trick on his baby sister,"This book is a must have for all parents who have an older son and a younger daughter. The book is pure joy and fun. My grandson loved having this book read to him, eyes twinkling about the thought of all the tricky things that went into making this very special sandwich for his sister."
4,Surprisingly Good Rock Album ( for Christians),"I ""discovered"" Neon Horse accidently and was taken aback when I found out they were Christian rock !!...what the ??Great record, short well arranged tunes with very theatrical vocals over pretty solid guitar riffs. ...and catchy as anything. Tried getting ""Cuckoo"" out of my head for days only to find it replaced by ""Crazy Daisy' ...Am I having a religious experience here or what ?Recommended."
4,good,I buy this product for my mother who absolutely loves this product. It's for the tanners who go every so often & may have a bit more sensitive skin.
3,Typical Thai Horror Film,The film is in Thai not Taiwanese Chinese as Amazon says. I picked this DVD up because I lived in Thailand for several years and the movie was made by the Pang Brothers of The Eye fame. This film is not as exciting as The Eye was and is more of your typical Thai film. The directors take a lot of steps to show off and the actors aren't professionals. There isn't a real push for acting in Thai films yet. The stories that the 3 women tell aren't that interesting and scary but do represent some aspects of Thai culture. I enjoyed seeing that and listening to the language more than the film. Hopefully the Pang Brothers will make better films in the future.
1,Oh God Shoot Me Now,"This film was so confusingly boring I can barely find the words to express myself. It's hard telling the female leads apart since they all looked alike, it's hard finding out what era the first segment is taking place in. It's not even close to scary, the coolest thing about the DVD is the menu art and box art. Everything was so predicable, and oh, did I mention confusing?This movie was given to me by my friend who didn't even want it on his shelf in his house. Quit praising this movie and giving it awards, I love good cinema, I can recognize good cinema, THIS IS NOT IT!"
1,253 pages of bull,"The good reviews written about this book must be written by the writer.There are a couple of good ideas but the rest is the MOST pretentious bull.He obviously doesn't want to share his storytelling secretsDON'T BUY IT!!I will give my copy to anyone who sends me the postage (I'm in the south of France)I was obliged to give this book ONE star, but it doesn't deserve it."
5,Just what I needed!,"I had just become a member of the Alter Guild at our Lutheran church, and needed some background information and guidance. This book was perfect."
1,not what i was expecting,The picture of the item was the item I wanted but is not what I received. Yes I received the newer edition book but I already had the newer book. I want the older copy of the book.
5,Simply amazing,"Alright, first off let me tell you how I found out about NFG. First off I went and bought a few cd's. In one of the cd's it gave me a little booklet of all the bands. HFG was one of the bands listed on the booklet. I didn't think much of it at the time. Then while watching a 411 skate video they had an advertisment for ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"" It was amazing. Trust me this cd is pop-punk/emo at it's best. It's not real fast punk like Lugnut or Suicide Machines but just as good. If you like hard guitar riffs with catchy lyrics get this. I would compare these guys to The Ataris or a harder version of The Get Up Kids."
2,Not much to hear here,"This kind of pop-punk is relatively common, and is plagued with the same problem: It lacks identity. The bands all sound the same. I cant recall any points of interest on this release, it just comes off as dull, boring, and weak. What I notice most is how poor the songwriting is. There is some embarrassing, uninspired lyric-writing at work here. The lyrics alone make it hard for me to listen. I try to be very honest and open-minded when I listen to music, but I just can't see any reason to buy this disc over all the similar ones out there."
2,Dissappointing,"New Found Glory is one of my favorite bands, but this is their worst album.Check out ""New Found Glory"" and ""Sticks and Stones""both of those are great, but this one isn't so good."
1,no,"I cannot believe it is possible that I am the second person to give this a 1 star review, have any of you ever thought that New Found Glory is just about the same as the Get Up Kids or Saves The Day, I admit, NFG has more cds out then both of those othe rbands, but the other bands were together before NFG was...trust me...if you want really good squeaky emo get ""The Get Up Kids, or Saves the day...thank you"
2,this cd is weak.. compared to others,"this is by far the worst new found cd there is... catalyst is the best... and to all you people who think they are ""sell outs"" because they are on mtv and stuff you are a dumbass cause they are trying to make money... they could care less what you think... the music has gotten better and better from one album to the next.. if you are looking to buy new found cds dont buy this one get one of the next three they are way better all around.. new found is a really good band and i am a huge fan.. but this album is weak"
1,A New Found Boring.......,"The Gods of the true punk world look downand laugh at a silly, and pathetic stab atpunk rock. i believe the term is ELMOmusic, ELMOTIONAL.....not even....worse.Recording quality is horrible!Singer is even Worse!Drummer is even more embarrasing!Suburban ""plunk"" rockers they are!"
5,Lifetime Meets Weezer meets the Get Up Kids & Saves The Day!,The first time I listened--it was really good. The second time it was REALLY good. The third time I was hooked and I can't stop singing the songs and listening to the cd. My friends all got the cd and now we ALL are HOOKED! THIS CD IS SO AWESOME!
3,Another good punk debut,"Usually fast yet melodic, and sometimes slow yet filled with energy,NFG has major potential.The best songs are the fast Hit or Miss and It Never Snows in Florida,and the slower Broken Sound and the Goodbye Song.But my favorite song shares a little from each and it's called 2's & 3's,the most emotionally charged song on the cd.Every song is pretty good with no lacklusters.NFG should have a bright future in the world of punk music.NOTE:If you like Fenix TX or Blink 182,chances are you will like this one."
3,Not as good as advertised,"I'm sorry. I find New Found Glory to be a really talented band to listen to, but that doesn't mean that they always were. Listening to this CD let's you know that NFG has come a long way. A LONG way. Some of the songs are catchy, even good, but there are just too many parts of the album where it sounds muddy. Some people would blame production (which is often the case with young bands), but a careful listen will also show a lack of proper song structure. On the up side, track two is very cool. If you are new to NFG you might want to stick to the newer stuff. Die-hards can buy it knowing that it's not going to be perfect album and still feel fine with shelling out $14 bucks on a band that has helped shape a genre and has claimed their absolute devotion (which is why I bought it)."
4,This is a Hit (not a Miss),"Okay, well, first of all...New Found Glory messed up when they did the cover album (not a big fan of cover bands, I admit) but they totally redeemed themselves with this album. It's kinda pop, but hey, that's NFG for ya! I liked this album's version of ""Hit or Miss"" best (as opposed to the one on their self-titled album). ""3rd And Long"" is also a favorite of mine. I recommend this CD because the guys are hot and they make good music."
4,the wait was worth it,"after 30 years Dollar$ has made it to CD and the wait was worth it. One of Quency Jones best scores is a pleasure to listen to without the snap, crakle or pop.I just i hope i don't have to wait another 30 years for the DVD of the movie to get on the market."
4,Dollar makes me Holler,"First of all, much thanks to urgeking for supplying the missing musician credits. That missing information was noticable in its absence from the fold-out CD poster/notes. Cute idea for an art department, but woefully lacking details that us fans like to have. Anyway, as for the music, most of is very entertaining. I love the two vocal cuts with Little Richard gleefully belting his heart away; ""Money Is"" and ""Do it to it."" Powerful stuff. Plus, most of the instrumental passages by Quincy are very well composed and played. I particularly like Doug (""The Ragin' Cajun"") Kershaw's fiddle contribution on one track. Less successful, I thought, was Robert Flack singing that tired old tune ""When You're Smiling."" Just not my cup of tea. Fairly short album in length (and nothing in the way of bonus cuts or unreleased material to pad this CD reissue) but still a very interesting recording."
4,Keep On Smiling!,"If you have not heard of the movie, don't blame Quincy Jones. As others who have bought this soundtrack...this is a gem.Quincy Jones uses his genius at harmony throughout, and pure jazzy/funk rhythms. But the real surpise here, for almost anyone, is the version of the old standard by DeWolf and Roberts ""When You Are Smiling,"" sung beautifully by Roberta Flack with gorgeous vocal choir. I promise you, the whole disc is worth the ""soul"" within this version...best ever!""Rubber Ducky"" is just ""Baby Elephant Walk"" fun! The movie went bust, but the music will surely live on thanks to Warner Music."
2,I was sent the wrong thing,"The product I received did not look like this picture. I was sent the newer model that doesn't match this photo. It fits and it works, but it's not what is pictured."
3,Glass Lid,The product pictured is not the product received so it does not match the rest of my Scanpan set. However the lid does fit and functions well so bearing in mind that form follows function the lid is acceptable.
3,Description,"""I don't blame you for hating me at first,"" Jake said. ""After all, I forced you to marry me. But you do see why I had to tell you all this, don't you? You've been so honest with me that I had to be the same with you.Tanya's heart sank. Honest! Honest! The word kept haunting her. Her supposed honesty was the one thing he admired about her.She couldn't possibly tell him the truth now. If she did his love for her would be shattered forever!"
3,"Nice Appearance, Doesn't stick well.","This was pretty difficult to attach to the phone so that it looked nice. Once it was attached the edges didn't stay down, possibly due to the way they wrapped around the edges of the phone. It just doesn't look like the picture. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this."
1,if i only had the book...,"I waited for 4 weeks to get the product because it said it might take that long, thinking that ""thats worse case scenario right?""...wrong, worse case was me not ever getting the book then being screwed in the class because by this point i had waited so long it was redundant to go buy the book somewhere else. If you don't have the book to send...don't trick someone by saying you do!"
5,Our whole family loves this book!,"We first saw this book at the library when my daughter was 5. I fell in love with it & had to buy it for her. It may be more appropriate for younger children, but she enjoys having it read to her, and I enjoy reading it. The pictures are beautiful. The descriptions of so many babies of varying shades and shapes are all very loving, affirming, and fun! My daugher likes to figure out which delicious flavor she is! This is a fantastic book."
3,"OK, but Shades of Black is better","Yes, the photos in this book are beautiful but I prefer the book ""Shades of Black"". This book, to me, seems like it copied the concept of Shades of Black and the words lack substance in my opinion. I bought this book for my daughter, wanting to fill her library with images of black children. This book is so boring, even I don't want to read it. I'll keep it because she likes the pictures and the colors...otherwise I'd probably sell it."
2,very lackluster courtroom drama,"This movie does not work on any level. Ned Beatty turns in a decent performance as the prosecuting attorney, but nothing else about this movie makes any sense. The plot is convoluted and silly, the writing is poor, and Theresa Russell is beautiful but unconvincing. The role of the obviously framed cop could have been played by anyone, and Burt Reynolds phones in his performance from another planet. There is no suspense, no urgency. Reynolds doesn't seem to care that he is about to be convicted for a crime he didn't committed; for that matter, no one else does either.What is amazing is that this totally forgettable dreck made it to DVD, whereas Russell's much better performance in ""Impulse"" remains only on VHS."
1,"dressage arena, yeah right","Do not buy this book if you are looking for ideas concerning dressage arena construction. It is ridiculous that ""dressage arenas"" is in the title. In a 71 page book, five pages involve dressage arenas. Most of that space discusses measuring out an arena. I was looking for a serious discussion about the constuction options available: wood, pvc, temporary, portable, etc. Our riding club needs to replace the barrier on two sand rings this year. If you need to build jumps this book might be helpful, for dressage arenas it is a waste of money."
2,Building horse stuff,I got this for my husband to build me a few things. There were more jumps in there than anything else but the saddle rack is good and the cavalettis. He liked the paper and the detail.
2,Could Have Been Better,"We recently purchased this book to help us make jumps for our pasture. Initially, it looks and sounds great. The shopping lists are great also. However,the instructions for cutting and constructing most of the jumps are very vague, ie, ""cut 2x4's to size."" There would be no mention of angles or length and sometimes the picture does not match what is happening in the instructions. Plan on doing a lot of figuring out as you go. It would be helpful if angles were specified and more detailed correct sketches were given. Also, sometimes the jump would be listed as a 2 foot jump, but the picture is 2'6"" and the instructions weren't clear. Some of the jumps, especially the brush box, for safety, needs to be able to be tipped over and the feet required reworking."
4,Great for ideas,"Good visuals and details, especially when working with someone not familiar with jumps. Also includes constructing stable products, such as tack boxes, saddle racks, mounting blocks, etc. A few color photos would have enhanced the presentation."
5,Love this book!,This book makes building jumps plus other useful barn items very easy to understand. I would recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to build their own jump course.
1,Disappointed with purchase,"I purchased this item based on the description that it was ""Vinyl"". When it arrived, it was not a record, but a CD. I would never have bought it if the description read CD. I had intended to give it as a present for a music-lover with a record player. I basically threw the money away, and still don't have a present, as I am not going to give a CD. Returning the item isn't worth it. I would appreciate better advertising for products, this was disappointing."
5,An essential book for every Christian.,This is a well written and inspiring book. Every Christian should read it! It gives real meaning to who we are and what the church is meant to do in everyday life.
1,Auto biography of an egocentric,"He and his buddies were so careful to ensure HIS safety. There were no preparations to protect anyone on the ground. If he dropped a piece of equipment or his balancing pole or if he fell off, it would've killed a few people down below. He craved the adoration of an audience but couldn't care less about them. What a jerk."
5,"ELEGANCE, CHARM, PATRIOTISM","Phillipe's book is phenomenal. What he did was absolutely stunning, both physically and artisticly. There is a beauty to his story that manages to intertwine the human form with our techonological and architectural triumphs. He reminds us that it was a mortal being that inspired the towers; that we are still capable of surpassing our greatest achievements.Those of you who criticize his character -- and I hardly think his character relevant to his art -- must have missed his performance on THE TONIGHT SHOW. He was by far the most charming and down-to-earth (forgive me) guest. Phillipe crossed broadway, despite the rain, and then sat with Letterman for an interview. His demeanor was sweet and he expressed his love for New York. By comparison, the hollywood princess next to him appeared ridiculous.I highly recommend this book."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I see that most everyone felt that this is a 5-star book, so I am apparently the anomaly. But while I enjoyed the first part of the book, and especially enjoyed the description of the walk and the immediate aftermath, I have to say that I found the amount of detail given to the actual set-up of the walk to be tedious and overdone. I came close to shutting down the book as I struggled to get through the middle section. Overall, an ""OK"" read, but one that gave me a real sense of how strong an obsession can be for some people."
1,Constant put-downs,"Reviewer RRiis is correct - this man may be an artist on the tightrope, but he has nasty attitude toward his audience. The egotism is one thing, but the constant put-downs of the general public, many of whom admire his work, really got on my nerves. The favorable reviewers must be masochists."
5,Exceptional!,"Until now we didn't know that Philippe Petit's exceptional gifts extend well beyond the high wire. This book is the best sort of 'caper' account: although the reader knows the ending, the writing style and personality of the author are so engaging that it is completely engrossing. I don't know what reviewer RRiis has against Petit (it sounds personal to me...) but his/hers is the only review I've seen (among dozens published) that is negative. Petit is a gifted writer, and this book is a wonderful gift. DON'T MISS IT!"
3,Pretty good,The action was great and the story line was interesting but it just seemed low budget to me to I couldn't really get into it.
3,Just Okay,"There is a lot better out there, I would skip it. Very slow, action is mild, acting could be a lot better."
4,Dino Dig,"Santa got this for our 7 year old daughter who loves dinosaurs. While the concept is essentially the same as the game ""Battleship"", it is actually more strategically involved than that as the fossil points you have to find aren't lined up like a battleship. So it is actually harder. We'll see how she catches on but it is going to take some time. Otherwise, great game!"
5,A pop gem sleeper. Absolutely and simply stunning!,"I was absolutely stunned by brilliance of Baaba Maal's unheralded single. This single genuinely deserved much more airplay than it got. Without question, it deserves to be ranked among the top 25 singles released in 1999. From the joyous, uplifting, Afro-Caribean beat of the opening radio mix to the hauntingly beautiful, ambient treatment by Fila Brazilia (one of my favorite smooth cuts of all time), the EP shines like a rare diamond amidst the rough of most of the pop single offerings. All five mixes are eminently danceable. Especially notable are the dub-heavy, jazz-tinged Thievery mix and the beautifully ethereal Fila Brazilia reconstruction. And don't forget the sultry and soothing female sub-vocals at the intro and conclusion of the wonderful afrobeat radio mix! Do yourself a favor - treat yourself to this single. You won't be disappointed."
3,Meh,"It seems I'm the only one who got it because it starred Caroline Dhavernas rather than Buffy's ""Angel"", and generally to me she was the best part of the picture, which was on the whole far fetched and shallow, but still mildly entertaining.If you are a Caroline fan, as I am, it would probably be worth you 2-4 dollars, to buy, but one viewing would probably suffice, so just hit the blockbuster."
5,I will admit,"That I bought this movie orginally to see David Boreanaz naked. I am very glad that I did. It is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of David's nice tush in the movie. If you have ever been a baby sitter in your life, you will get a hoot out of this one."
3,Eh.,"Okay, first confession: I will watch and buy anything that stars David Boreanaz. I just love the big lug, and it's been really fun to watch him improve as an actor over the years. Second confession: my favorite part of the movie was David naked, and David playing a big pothead.That's... about all this movie has going for it. None of the leads are in any way sympathetic. In fact, I thought all four of them (including David's character Keith) were HIDEOUS human beings... and not in a fun way. The plot the three girls hatch is simply unbelievable, and Keith Too Stupid To Live for letting it happen to him. Not to mention he's completely gross for being ""that guy"" that hangs around banging high school girls well into his 30's.So... see it for David, if you're a fan. If not, I sincerely doubt your life will be any less rich for having missed it."
3,Review of These Girls,This movie is fun and holds your interest. It is a kind of shoe is on the other foot where the girls are in charge. What they come up with in sharing a guy is really good. You can't help but like the girls and their choice of who to spend their summer with is one most of us would make. If you like David Boreanaz you will like this movie.
3,20 Years In Waiting,"For 20 years I have regretted not purchasing this book. I first saw it in a book store while in college, and ever since the subject intrigued me.The Pan Am story is truly an American Saga. Robert Daley takes an ""Detective Friday"" approach in only reporting the facts. Nevertheless, the tale is worth reading. Prior to Juan Trippe's Pan Am, the only way to get from one continent to another was via steamer. Trippe, Lindbergh and the orignal Pan Am employees established commerical aviation as we know it today. Daley, as dry as he can be, does a thorough job of factually describing the infancy of commercial air travel.If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, do it. It is a far better way to spend your time than on some of a mindless pap currently available."
3,Needs Pictures!,"The text is well researched, well written, and very interesting. However, the book would be much more interesting if it had pictures!"
3,"Great Camera, Great Photos, Great Price!","This is an amazing camera! I bought it, quite skeptically, but am so glad I did. It is small, which was one of the features I was really looking for in a camera, and light weight. It carries easily in a purse, coat pocket or around your wrist. It takes great pictures, and the resolution is amazing. The pictures come out crystal clear. The menu's are easy to follow. The features are great-- there are a variety of options when it comes to color, and size of the photo. The only thing that I don't like is the software that comes with it. It is not the best I have used. I tend to just use the software that came installed on my computer. It is easier, as you can rotate and crop pictures right there.Over all, I rate this camera really highly and think it is a great buy for anyone!"
2,"The ""sit back and wait"" game","I bought this game for my 11 year old son because he loves roller coaster tycoon, ski resort tycoon, and zoo tycoon. This tycoon game had nice graphics and music (when we found a computer that had an adequately equipped video card) but that was about it for positive qualities. The manual is horrible, the online tutorial is useless, and gameplay is not intuitive when it comes to figuring out what the player should be doing as far as building and the business end of running an airport. The money runs out way too fast and the contracts come in way too slow - not a lot of action or fun. One of my biggest pet peeves about this program is that there are spelling and grammar errors throughout the program. It is almost like the person who wrote it doesn't speak English as his/her first language. Not a good example for kids unless you want to teach them how NOT to check their work...This is one tycoon game I would suggest avoiding."
2,"Some promise, needs to be improved","I LOVED the original Airport Tycoon and got hooked on it. But Airport Tycoon 2 was a total bust. Panda Jet and Orient Air the only airlines serving Tel Aviv? No interior detail in the terminal? COME ON!!!So I hoped that Airport Tycoon 3 would remedy the flaws and become the souped up Airport Tycoon I was hoping for. It didn't quite make it. The graphics are decent, and a lot of problems with Airport Tycoon 2 (i.e. lack of terminal interiors) were fixed. But some things leave a lot to be desired. For one thing, where are the security areas in the terminal? You can't build your own custom terminals. And China Int'l serving Chicago to Indianapolis????? Hmmm....I'd pick the original Airport Tycoon before 2 or 3."
4,"Better than AT1 & 2, but still needs improvement","It's true that this version improves highly on Airport Tycoon 1 & 2. But there are also many things I think need to be fixed. First, it still has a difficult, confusing interface. Also, it still has too many constraints (for example, if a plane stand is not positioned a certain way, it will not work -- you have to manually rotate it first). I would definitely choose AT3 over AT1 or AT2, but I am waiting expectantly for AT4, hoping that these problems will be addressed."
1,I hope Global Star reads this!,"I have A.T.1 and it is awsome I still play it. I really wanted part 3 and now that I got it, it is really bad. I downloaded a trainer off the web for unlimited money, but after I downloaded the patch for the game from global star the trainer doesn't work. I can not make any money and I always go bankrupt. Who evens knows how to charge airlines to land at your airport? You can't expand your terminal or destory it to build a bigger on. Until Global Star can figure out how to fix all the problems This CD will be a frisbee for my dog!"
3,Airport Tycoon 3,"The game is overall worth buying if you are into the workings of an aiport and always wanted to give it a try in a less drastic way...The game overall is something that can easily be made very enjoyable. A few texture issues and gameplay issues need to be addressed to keep the game more interesting, truely the only way to get through a full game is on fast forward. The music is less then desirable and may drive you nuts after a while. Being an aviation and airport buff I still enjoyed the game. Any news on Airport Tycoon 4? I hope they make another one making these nescessary improvements. I will definately be buying!"
2,Airport Tycoon Disappointing,"Global Star has yet to live up to its original Airport Tycoon...ACT2 was a ""bust""....ACT3 graphics improved and some ACT2 fixes, but still seems to be lacking improvements found in other ""more"" current simulation games...if you have #1 or #2, no need to purchase #3....let's hope #4 lives up to its hype..."
1,Don't even bother...... Read the other reviews,"This game is a disgrace. It is a total deception for global star, and I hope they read this because I ame never ever going to buy another game from Global star.The game grafics are ok but the game is imposible to handle.First of all the view option dont even let you see your own airport. Then when I cant do anything about the view and I give up trying to fix it I build the specified things inorder for the airport to open, but the game remains paused. IT IS FULL OF BUGS. BAck to the views; whenever I change view options and then return to the normal viewmode, the normal view mode is compleatly at another view.This game is a disgrace to tycoon games and I Hope Global Star will never produce a game. ITS A WASTE OF TIME and MONEY..."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This has to be the worst tycoon game that I ever bought. The manual dosn't match, the game is full of mastakes, and you end us sitting there and waiting way too much.This game is worthless."
1,Discusting!!!,this game is awful!!! it is hard to figure out where to put things and the tutorial is no help at all! it is hard to navigate and it is incredibly boring. i would NOT recomend this for ANYONE unless you are BEGGING for a vein to pop in your forehead!!!
1,Why did I buy this??,"I did not follow everyone else advice and went ahead and bought it. Don't do it! It's boring, slow, and not very exciting. It takes a long time to even get playing and is very difficult to figure the game out. Also the camera angels although they do allow you to rotate now are still not very helpful."
3,Somewhat Dissapointing,I expected a lot more out of airport tycoon. The game has a ton of glitches and is very complicated. It was nothing like I would have expected.
1,Help assistance,Both the pop-up help and the written documentation are completely inadequate to the task. For all practical purposes this game is undocumented. Suitable only for those who like to spend hours experimenting to find the solution for what should be easily learned from the program authors.
2,Waiting Game,"I like the whole ""Airport Management"" concept, but the game is soooo slow. I mean you have to wait so long until you actually get a contract and its hard to make money. I wish they would come out with a game like this but much more fun with more action and almost no waiting just like the Roller Coaster Tycoon games. I would definitly not waste my money on this game unless you have way too much time on your hands."
1,Tough game,"This game has a ton of potential. It could be an amazing game, but it is impossible to play. First, when building a new airport the camera angle is soooooooooooo bad that you will never even be able to see what your building. The scenario modes are impossible too because you get very little money to start with and you will never get offered the contracts you need to make money to run your airport."
2,Not as good as other Tycoon titles,"I bought this for my son, an avid 8yr old video game junkie. He picked it out himself because of the ""tycoon"" name. He has a couple games from the Zoo Tycoon that he loves to play, and for a good report card, was allowed to get another game. He choose Airport Tycoon 3. I must say, compared to Zoo Tycoon, this game is just plain boring! He kept at it, and needed a lot of help from me to even figure it out, and finally built himself a thriving airport, but there really is no action. I'm not sure what age bracket they are targeting, because it's not fun for kids, and I myself wouldn't bother with it.In addition to this game, he got Sim City 3000 which he is now addicted to. As far as simulations go, this one stinks."
1,Don't Waste your money!,The airport tycoon games just getting worse and worse as the come out with new versions.
1,dont but this,"i wanted this game since i was a little kid,im 12 years old now and i finally put some money away to get it,immediately when i got it:bugs,glitches,troubleshoots,everyting wents wrong,now here i am,i have owned this game for 3 week,im very good at the game but when i save my game and try to load it it almoast loads up and the says ""at3 has stopped working"" everything you save and try to load it simply does'nt load,rendering the game useless,this is a very fun game,but with all the turmoil and stuff i've gone through to try to fix this stuff,im 12 and litterally shedding my hair!and it still doesnt work,pls im begging all fellow consumers from the bottom of my heart dont get ripped off like i did,go buy ghost recon advanced warfighter,its a keeper :)"
4,Works great...just like new...,"I was wondering how this canera would look being it said it was used. But when we got it, it was in NEW condition. And works great. Just what we wanted.... thanx"
1,Save you money,Save your money and buy the Singles collection if you arelooking to hear the original recordings.
3,it was not good as i tought,"is good, but not as I tought, my baby got bored with it, she like the music, but thats all. i dont recomend to spend your money on it."
2,Disappointing and boring,"I found this toy to be very hard to turn on and off. You have to push a small button and hold it for three seconds. My grandson is one and seems to want a nearly immediate response for his efforts. Once I turned it on and tried everything once, I was bored. I cannot imagine this holding the attention of any child. The best thing is a lizard that giggles, but even that is difficult to make work. You have to squeeze it just right and squeeze it very hard. I would not recommend buying this sight unseen."
4,Well worth the money,"This toy is very difficult to turn on, and even my 5 year old has trouble with it. Once on, the only electronic feature my baby can use is the steering wheel's horn. He cannot push hard enough to activate anything else.Even without the electronic features though, my baby LOVES this toy. We first introduced it when we went on a 22 hour car trip. He never got bored of it, and because of the Velcro ring, it stayed attached to his car seat and he never lost it.I highly recommend this product to anyone with a baby that needs some car seat distraction."
1,Boring Toy,"I bought this toy in preparation for a 25 hour trip over the holidays, with my 17-month old. A couple of the reviews I had read prior to purchasing this toy, said that it was more appropriate for a toddler. Uh, no. She looked at it for about 2 minutes and was done. She never regained interest. The steering wheel is NOT too hard to turn as noted in other reviews. The toy is soft and cute, but definitely more suitable for an infant/baby under the age of one."
4,Rowenta ZD6030 Expert Iron Board Cover,"The quality of this board cover is fabulous. The one thing I do not like about it is that the side seams, which are intended to enable a better fit (I guess), don't drop to the side enough for my taste. As such, there is a slight seam on the upper surface of the ironing board cover, albeit it is on the very edge. Seems like they could have given the material another 1/4 to 1/2 inch all the way around and had a more perfect fit. I haven't washed it yet, but will not be putting it in the dryer."
3,What planet is this softwaare from?,"Clunky interface and static controls make it very hard to get used to and persisitently frustrating. Interesting story, though (and if you like mystery, more the better). I like the video inter-weaving, but the 3d graphics, well (am I just spoiled by the likes of Halo and Max Payne?) truthfully leave something to be desired. The puzzles are way too hard for anyone to ever figure out on their own (I had to cheat, and I like a good challlenge, you know?). I'll bet this guy I know, Dave, could figure it out, he's a puzzle brain-iac..."
2,Don't bother....,"This game is, for the most part, a complete waste of time. Aside from the HORRIBLE dub job on the audio, the FMV sequences are rough, forced, and contrived...The 'puzzles' weren't so much puzzles as much as trial and error with the inventory items...Unless you get this game as either a gift or at a bargain basement price, don't waste your time and money..."
4,Fun Game,"I really liked this game. Maybe it's just me, but I love the movie aspect of the game, interacting with real people instead of animations. Good story too! A good murder mystery."
3,"Flawed, but trying","This is a strange little game that reminds me of Tex Murphy #3 (Under a Killing Moon) in ambition and graphics, but frankly it's not nearly that well written. Or acted. The puzzles are convoluted and obscure, with the solutions being not just tricky but ridiculous, practically impossible to figure out unless you just select items at random. Acting, writing, and translating are all equally hideous and amateurish; it's downright embarrassing to watch the lead embrace his girlfriend, both as relaxed and loving as two bricks.All the same, I'd love to see them make more. They've got the right idea, and the execution can only get better. But next time, guys, pay for professional actors. And writers. And translators!!"
1,Horrible game!,"I decided not to listen to the previous reviewer that said that the cutscenes were the worst he'd ever seen and that the game was horrible and I wasted my money!!!! This game is the most horrible game ever and I have played many games and many games that were great and many games that were ok or nothing special. There is no way to bypass the lengthy movie in the beginning everytime you start to play in this ""game"", which is really a commercial for bayer or painkillers, it gave me such a headache. The cutscenes were choppy and obvious; anyone could have done a better job than that. They should receive an award for worst editing, worst voice acting, worst dubbing, worst acting, worst game ever. If you don't want to listen to reason, get it, waste your money and make them rich. I cannot convey to you how horrible this game is and amateurish and visually backward. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
2,Couldn't even finish it,"I practically live on the computer with this type of game. I am not an expert but just someone who really loves solving mysteries and such. This was one of the worst games I have ever tried to play. I say tried because I never finished it. The dialogs between characters are pitiful and the movement and control of the character and objects is too complicated to make it fun. If you like a challenge then you might like this, but if you just like to have fun (like with CSI) then it's not worth it."
5,FMV....addicted,"Fantastic game!!! I really loved the plot. It was so complicated, i had to re-play it to ""catch"" the story. It's one of the best FMV's ever! Even my wife enjoyed it :0)Special credits to the support team. Can't wait for the sequel!"
4,Realistic Portrayal,I have been a follower of the Vietman War for some time and I felt that I was there on the field as I was reading this book. The images were clear and I can almost feel the fear and desperation in Mr. Down's voice.
5,Good Book,"My son really enjoyed this book... Gave it as a Christmas present, my son was very happy with the gift..."
4,Tells It Like It Was.....,"An outstanding story of a young Army lieutenant who pretty much saw it all. And in less than six months. From the time he arrived, through his harrowing and agonizing encounters with Charlie, he tells it like it was. Anyone can write war fiction, but he was there. He wrote it as only a true vet could write it. You could feel his relief, after surviving a horrible fire fight. You could feel his joy when he was on a 3-day pass. And you could feel his pain when he was nearly blown to pieces by what every 'Nam vet knows of - a bouncing betty.Cinch your helmet, grab your web gear, lock and load, and prepare for Viet Nam the way it was. I was there too. As we used to say, ""there it is."""
5,GatorOne,"I have never and likely will never know the experience of combat. I read personal accounts of our veterans to gain perspective on what they have done for us. Some of the most trying situations lead me to wonder, ""What would I do?"" It happened over and over for me in this book. The author is faced with the responsibility of leading and protecting men, as well as making decisions to fire upon seemingly innocent civilians that are actually a threat to his men or other americans. One of the best, and most humble accounts I have read."
4,Enjoyed this book very much.,"I very much enjoyed this book. It was well written and well worth reading in the context of the world in 2010 and the current conflicts around the globe. I have not been in the military myself, but I felt like it was portraying the thoughts and emotions of joining the service, training, and serving fairly and accurately as far as I could tell."
5,an excellent account of a soldier in NAM,"This is my second book on Vietnam War and it worth it. I know that very young people fought this war, but it still surprise me the age of this lieutenant, in charged of many lives. Reading the day to day living, you realize the reasons why USA didn't win this war.I was delighted with this book because it gave a glimpse of military strategy, leadership and the true reality when you have to fight for your life and the lives of your group. You become aware that, despite the excellent skills as a soldier that someone might have, there is always a considerable percentage that is just lottery, whether you become a wounded or death man (peanut)."
5,5 Stars.,"This effort is one of the better accounts of the Vietnam War. It's interesting, well-written, and the accounts are plausible and intelligently reported."
5,An expressive account of war without the bias...,"This book provides a clear-cut, objective analysis of an American soldier's involvement in the Vietnam War. The author, Downs, makes very few allusions to his thoughts, opinions, or feelings over U.S. involvement; instead, he provides a detailed interpretation of the horrors of combat, the bond between soldiers, his fears, military strategy, and the people of Vietnam. This book will capture and move you, and make you appreciate the efforts of the American foot-soldier in Vietnam."
4,A Perfect Title,"One of the most realistic books on the Viet Nam War that you will ever read. A ""boots on the ground"" look at a small segment of time in a small area of the country that says volumes about the empty feeling of those who served. If you were there, you will appreciate what this man has to say. Hollywood would have a tough time adapting this story."
5,A must read,"I have just recently became interested in this somewhat forgotten war. This is the third Vietnam war book I have read in the last month. Great read. You will not be disappointed, very well written."
2,Blood / Guts,I couldn't wait until I finished this boring book on His bio of the war.Tho I'm sure he experienced all those conditions.I came away disappointed in the story.Where were all the enemy snipers ?
3,Good story,Good story just hard for me to get into for some reason. Don't know if it's me or the book. I don't regret buying the book it's full of good information and some great stories. I like the book just hard for me to get into.
4,Really interesting book.,"This book was really good, it started a little slow, and it climaxed really fast. It was like I started reading it and then all of a sudden it was over. It was definitly a good book though, all kinds of cool little stories."
2,Boring,this book is not exciting at all. He doesn't explain any of the terminology he uses in the book. I stopped reading this book half way.
2,For veterans ... not for normal folk,"I bought this book because it had a cumulative 4.5 start rating on amazon. I did read this book cover to cover but was disappointed by the writing style. The point to note is that this book is written by a soldier, not a writer and this comes across quite clearly in every sentence thats written in this book. Sentences are fragmented, they end abruptly and you can tell that the writer is trying to convey his emotions by using his own type of linguistics. This may be appreciated by some war veterans who can closely relate to the experience in Vietnam (or other wars). However for a reader like myself that does not relate to being in an army it was hard to really appreciate.The events in the book are quite dramatic and there is a lot of action. By the end of the book one feels that a better author would have done all that transpired in Vietnam much more justice.Overall ... packed with material but not a fun read."
2,Everything Not to Do in Combat,"This is a scary book; it reveals everything NOT to do in a combat zone. The author, a green Lieutenant, takes charge in Vietnam, and is candid, revealing just how innocent and trusting he was. It is difficult to read because of all the (I apologize) foolish things he does as a leader. If you are used to reading combat books, where the author is savvy and tough, this read will set you back a bit. It is sobering, for the reasons pointed to above."
4,Great Music...,"I am a huge fan of Rahsaan Patterson. I love his way of interpreting a lyric and bending a note. His phrasing paints vivid pictures that will touch you in places you never thought possible. ""Love In Stereo"" is a great CD, filled with tight musicianship and beautifully arranged vocals. This is a must have for music lovers. The only problem is that it is too short. Can't wait to hear these songs performed live."
5,This is a good CD!,"Rahsaan Patterson is in my opinion the most underrated vocalist in the game. This CD all 12 songs are just great. He can really carry a tune, I recommend this CD to everyone who wants to listen to a soulful expression of real music.. nobody can touch this brother!"
5,THIS IS THE R&B ALBUM FOR 1999.,"This album is true R&B, not the ""15 minutes"" & tacky ""Meeting in My Bedroom"" caveman stuff. This CD is the smooth brother with all the right moves and the perfect game!"
4,Go Rah!,"Rahsaan Patterson, to me, is one of the most underrated male vocalists out there. I took a chance in 1997 and purchased his first album. The result: pure satisfaction! If you haven't purchased the first album, go and cop it now! His follow-up album Love In Stereo, offers more of the same vocal abilities as well as his funk-based rhythms that the first album produced. Songs #11,10, and 8 are sure to get you open. Rahsaan's albums are phat! He deserves to be up there ranking with Maxwell and D'Angelo for real!"
3,I'LL GET USED TO IT...,"The vocals are there... Some of the tracks scream 'Crossover' unfortunately. That song 'Do You Feel...' sounds too much like Chico DeBarge's current single, 'Give you what you want', also produced by Soulshock & Karlin... Patterson co wrote Chico's song... why didnt he say 'Uh.. wait up... this sound too much like Chico's ' Keyboard line also is reminiscent of Tracie Spencer's current single, also produced by S & K... (WHY DO PRODUCERS DO THIS? MR. JERKINS?? MR. FACE??)As it stands, I still prefer the first CD to this one... Musically...I hope he doesnt go too far into the mainstream... theres too many similar sounding songs on the radio... Which is one reason I loved his first CD... originality abounded. Regardless, his phrasings as always are exquisite. Who knew the little black boy from Kids Inc. would grow into such a talented song stylist?"
5,EXCELLENT MUSIC FOR REAL MUSIC LOVERS,"I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET THIS CD. WHEN I GOT THE NEWS IT WAS COMING OUT I PURCHASED IT ASAP. RAHSAAN'S FIRST CD WAS THE BOMB AND I KNEW THIS ONE WOULD BE AS WELL. I PUT THIS CD IN MY BOX AND IT STAYED THERE FOR ABOUT A MONTH STAIGHT. I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY THE WAY I DIDN'T HAVE TO SKIP PAST A TUNE. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, ONE JAM AFTER ANOTHER, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. YOU GO, RAHSAAN! I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MISSING OUT ON THIS GREAT MASTERPIECE. I LOVE YOU RAHSAAN, I WILL ALWAYS BE A FAN. MY FAVORITE SONG IS... THERE ARE TOO MANY TO NAME. THE CD IS PLATINUM WORTHY."
3,Not as good as his first,"This CD is good with a nice soulful flow, but compared to his first cd, this one is not as artistic. The sounds and songs favor his first cd too much."
4,Someone up and coming,I've just heard of Rahsaan Patterson but his style is awesome. Love to listen to his voice.
3,Isn't as good as his first release,While it is a fair album I found myself disappointed since the first release was such a wonderful joy to find by accident. I feel the music becomes repetitive and looses focus. While Rahsaan's first release had a definite theme of love and relationships the next release seems to be all over the place.
2,Important,These plugs are too long for the 97 tercel 5efe motor. The coil pack will not bolt down and you may leak oil into the spark plug tube.
1,Biased at Best,A jaundicised view of the Kashmir Problem. There are far better and unbiased books on the subject out there. It is always better to go for an independant observer (i.e. not from India or Pakistan) to get a really true perspective on the issue.... I do not recommend this book.
3,Returned this card,"Pros: Seemed to work well on software utilizing Direct X 8, easy installation.Cons: Did not perform as well as onboard graphics in my Dell GX270 when using Direct X 9.Summary: Not much to choose from in the low profile cards, but I found an ATI Radeon card that out performed this one."
3,Nicely illustrated story for kids aged 5 and up.,I read this to my 3 1/2 year old and the story was a bit lengthy and above her head. The illustrations are nicely done and the story's premise is quaint.A paper doll named Little Oh gets lost and tries to find her mother - the woman who created her.I'd recommend it for kids closer to five years of age and up with a longer attention span and ability to focus on a longer plot than the typical picture book.
1,"run...run far, run fast from this book","I have NOT read this book, but news of it is making the rounds. As the previous review states, this book gives the solution to the ""Birthday Problem"" as 435/366. The problem is, no probability can be greater than one. With such a giant mistake (and horrible explanation which develops this number) this is obviously a book to stay away from."
1,The thinking is sometimes less than critical.,"Many aspects of thinking are analyzed. One section emphasizes the importance of knowing what one does not know. This is illustrated by a quiz with some interesting answers: Alaska (not Hawaii) was the last state to join the United States, dinosaurs were probably not egg-laying creatures, and it takes thunder longer to travel two miles (about 10 seconds) than it takes the sun's light to travel to earth (over 8 minutes). It is also shown (page 103) that the probability of two people in a group of thirty having the same birthday is 435/366, a very large ratio indicating ""that it is almost certain that two people in any group of thirty will share the same birthday."""
2,book not on par with earlier work,Candace Camp should try to recreate the great writing she did in Rosewood and Heirloom - her recent books have not done her justice. I loaned Rosewood to people who would have never read a romance novel and they loved it. I hope she does another good book someday.
3,"Pleasant, Predictable","Formulaic, familiar, an easy read, but certainly not on par with her earlier work. Buy this used, you won't want to keep it."
1,not for me,"I appreciate that this is pure and unlike many diet supplements I feel it would do no harm,no chems or stimulants.But I didn't notice that it helped hunger much either."
3,soccer balls,the balls were OK. Our dog likes them but they are not very firm. Not like if you bought them fro a store.
2,A Bit Disappointing,"I've read some of the other commentaries in this series and they generally make good devotional commentaries, but this one was disappointing. The author does not provide much in the way of insight or application beyond what you can read in the text of Genesis 12-50 itself."
4,Joyce has some wonderful insights,"Baldwin has already written commentaries on Daniel, Samuel, Esther and Haggai to Zechariah (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries). This is not a commentary, instead she narrates the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, fleshing out the details not specified in the bible. Joyce provides us with insights to understand it a bit better."
2,Too bad was expecting more,I was anticipating a better game. Lucas Arts Outlaws was much better. Western Outlaw has a below average sound track and graphics. Of course first person western shooters are far and few between. I did like the weapons. Seemed like the levels were similar in plot to Lucas Art's Outlaws. $20.00 is overpriced for this game.
3,Wait for Dead Man's Hand,We haven't seen a real first person Western shooter since LucasArts released Outlaws back in '97. This game isn't going to be nearly as good as Dead Man's Hand. I've seen a few reviews already and Dead Man's Hand looks like it really rocks. It's an Xbox game but you can bet they'll probably put it out for PC as well.
2,nowhere near as good as the reviews would lead you to believe,"Ok so the single (Automatic) is pretty good, but after that...there's nothing but extremely soft alt. rock on the not-so-catchy side. Also, I think I lost even more respect for the band when I discovered that it's in fact the lead singer on the cover coming out of the ground...and here's the bad part...what you don't see on the Amazon picture is that on the back cover you can see his fat pale @$$ cause he's lying on his stomach naked on the back cover...it's enough to make me wanna sell the cd even if it was the best thing I'd heard. I'm sure they thought it was ""artsy"" but I think it's just plain stupid. If you want some truly great alternative pop-rock then forget this and pick up Neve, Strange Celebrity, or July For Kings."
3,"Not bad, not good.... just there.","Collapsis really doesn't get recognized much, probably because their music is so noncontraversially ""just there"". There are no major faults with 'Dirty Wake'. The entire cd is well written and composed; a little undertoned though.As far as alternative music is concerned, Collapsis just isn't an outstanding band. There is no real message or statement behind the lyrics; and with this cd I never quite felt there was anything I had to ""digest"" after hearing.If you're looking for a tolerable ""background music"" cd, then 'Dirty Wake' may be just what you want. Otherwise, this album is uninspired, boring, and pretty dull."
3,"Simple, but in a good way","I guess it depends what you like. I used to love this kind of music, just simple sing-along rock, happy sounding, really pretty good when it comes right down to it. I could take this album in a car and drive around listening to it with the window open, even all the windows open, and it would be great. I'd say if you're in the mood for something carefree, with some nice beats, maybe something to sing along to, this is perfect. There aren't really any surprises, no controvery, and I can't see it as being unlikeable in any way."
4,Almost Right,"This is, once again, beautiful haunting music as only Ms Roth can do. However, the music is again marred by the constant intrusions of yoga or meditation instructions, which turns the music into merely functional program or background. While this is useful for some, please offer a companion album of purely instrumental mixes of this stunning music!"
5,Excellent for optimum receiver principles,"I used parts of this book in a digital communications course at UIUC. The book is written in a very lucid manner, atleast the chapters that I referred to - 3, 4 & 5. They provide a solid understanding to the subject material and it may seem mind boggling that even though the book was written way back in 1965 it is still a classic and is considered as one of the best references for optimum receiver principles. It makes for some smooth and sufficient reading (chaps. 3,4,5) when compared to other books such as that by Proakis etc. A must buy for any person in the Communication Area!"
1,What a disservice...,"An uninspired, bland, academic (in the worst sense) rendition. Timeless masterpieces reduced to etudes on notes by Bach, devoid of any but the most elementary phrasing and rudimentary insight. No stature, no joy - a perfect example of what NOT to do, musically and instrumentally. Does Perenyi actually hate the Suites, or just doesn't understand them? - one is left wondering which is greater tragedy. A very regrettable (mis)interpretation..."
3,Bed Cover,I really like the blanket but I only recieved 1 of the pillow shams and it said that there was 2 shipped so I ended up having to pay for another pillow sham that took for ever to get in.
5,short read with good ideas,This book has all the worksheets you can think of and some great ideas for your child(ren). Now I'm much more prepared and excited about teaching my little boy how to be responsible with money. He gives some fun and easy ways to teach children as well as adults how to handle money to your benefit.
5,A book my mother and I BOTH liked.,"I bought this book for my mom for her 58th birthday, thinking it would be funny and a good spring read. She said she laughed out loud so much of the time that she promptly made me read it too. We both liked the offbeat characters that somehow seemed like plausible people and the way they had to balance their romantic lives alongside familial expectations- haven't we all had trouble with that! I would totally recommend this to anyone looking to laugh and be satisfied at the end of the story."
3,"Ok, just not what i expected","I think this book was interesting, but i had the impression that it was funny, and i really only got one or two tiny chuckles out of it. There wasn't anything funny, so much as quirky, about it. I just think that the summary was a little exaggerative. For instance, the clown therapy mentioned on the back is only in a page or two of the book. Quite frankly, i was just hoping it would get better, and was dissapointed at the end. i was expecting laughter, and came out with little interest and boredom. I would recommend it, if you buy it on clearance, so as not to waste too much money."
2,silly but somewhat entertaining,"This book was really over the top silly, and even the title didn't fit the story too much.The premise was good, but the ending didn't deliver."
4,"Not the best of the series, but not bad","I own all 4 of the released Burn to Shine DVDs, and I gotta say... I thought Seattle would be a really good one, but it's my least favorite. It's still good, but if the Seattle one is the first time you see any of these, make sure to give the rest of them a chance!"
2,Not the counterpart to Moneyball it claims to be,"I gave this the first star simply because it is a book about football. The second star is because it does have interesting history about the NFL Draft and you do get a close look at how an NFL team evaluates a draft class. Over a hundred pages of this book are absolutey WASTED on SCUMBAG AGENTS!!! I do not, nor does any person with a conscience or decency, want to read anything that profiles and glorifies these money hungry crooked wastes of life that help to ruin professional sports. If you do decide to get this book, skip chapters 4-8 as they deal mainly with agents. The rest of the book is interesting and for that matter deserves a look."
4,A look behind the curtain,"I liked the book okay. It painted a somewhat realistic scenario of what goes on behind closed doors at a NFL franchise but not completely realistic based on what's been going on in the actual league and the trading values of picks. I thought the author took more than his fair share of latitude in painting a few of the trade scenarios but the story seemed to work and was an entertaining read. Compare this book to John Feinstein's excellent ""Next Man Up"" is a study in fiction vs fact. Both are entertaining to read and I guess it depends on what one prefers in that sometimes reality is more fascinating than fiction.I think the author could have done more in-depth research and fleshed out the story more than he did. It's almost a novel where there was a looming deadline and he was forced to fast track the story to get it done in time. All in all, not bad."
3,Pete Williams' The Draft,"Pete Williams went a long way towards demystifying the process and history of the NFL Draft. Whether talking about the early days and why the draft was instituted to covering the modern Combine, he touches on nearly everything associated with the subject.Perhaps it's just the material, but even with a long series of vignettes, Williams style can seem dry and didactic at times. However - the information garnered is worth the sometimes long slog thru the pages. As a reference it could have covered the actual process of the Combine better - what specific tests are involved and why, how are they measured and graded for example - but still - it's a huge subject and I thought that he did fairly well in pulling it together. I gave it three stars out of five - great attempt, despite some of the weaknesses that were inherent in carving the material down to size."
1,Items Received were NOT What Was Listed,"This product was not listed correctly on Amazon. Instead of receiving 3 boxes of folders with 10 in each box, I received 3 folders. In speaking with the shipper, they could only send me 3 boxes of similar folders without the hanging tabs. I would have to purchase the folders I needed for about $9 per folder. Very dissatisfied!"
1,"Good story, bad structure","I'm really sorry to have to give this such a low rating, because the story concept is indeed wonderful. Having found six glaring grammatical errors on the first page alone, I nevertheless struggled through the many more to come. It was a really painful read for me. Not just the grammar, but the structure and flow were just not there. This book could use an extensive workout with a good editor."
3,Counter top waste basket,I bought this for my husband's use. He likes to have something handy when working in the kitchen so he doesn't have to drag out the large trash can from underneath the sink. This waste can is nice looking but much too big. It would be better half the size. It overpowers the counter top so I stuck it in the corner.
2,Meh,The lid doesn't stay on the can... With or without a garbage bag inside. Its annoying. The size is okay and it looks fine.
2,Really small,"I dont' think I anticipated on how small it was going to be. Not sure if it's worth the buy. I got it for my room, but it barely holds anything."
5,Mini Waste Can,"I needed a small covered swing top waste can to use in my coffee area. Love my Keurig and wanted a small covered waste can to hold all the used pods. Fits nicely on the counter without looking like a garbage can. It is a gallon size and I bought gallon size bags but the bags are a little small to fit around the rim, but I make do. The can was a good buy"
4,It's a trash can.,"How much can be said about a small trash can? It does what it is supposed to do, it holds trash. It looks fine. It is being used in a bathroom. Yay!"
3,Not a bad little can for the price.,"It looks good, though I wouldn't be surprised if the shiny plastic finish eventually scratches or scuffs. I ordered two, and both came shipped with their lids tilted sideways and stuffed down into the cans, which made the cans bow out into a lopsided oval. It wasn't really noticable once the lids are back on, but still, mildly irritating. Slightly more irritating is that the swinging lid isn't balanced properly - it leaves an inch or two window of visibility into the trash can, which is definitely not classy. But I didn't buy them thinking they'd be super classy, I bought them because the price was right, and they work fine for what I wanted them for - minimalist little trash cans for my bathrooms."
1,Mini Bin,"Total waste of time. Very flimsily made , and the lid just won't stay on. Mini is the operative word...MUCH too small for any use"
1,too flimsy for the price,"This trash can was very thin, cheap plastic, much like you'd find in a dollar store. I will most likely return it."
1,Worst design one could imagine for such a simple product,"This can is extremely poorly designed. The top part is not in any way attached to the bottom - it just sits on top of it. This means that EVERY time you press the flip-top to throw something out, the whole top part comes off an/or goes into the can itself (can is thin plastic and bends easily).Avoid this product, it causes much more frustration than convenience."
3,Lid not good enough,"While I really like the size of this can and the lid as far as looks, the lid is always coming off and/or sliding into the can itself. Drives me crazy!"
3,Get what you pay for,"It's a ""petite"" trash can that works well in small places, but the lid doesn't fit well. The lid frequently falls off if you're not careful."
2,Small...,"I use this thing in my bathroom upstairs, I kinda wish it was bigger. I was kinda disappointed when I got it, also the top sometimes comes off. I would recommend buying a different product and spending a bit more money."
3,Little Trash Can,Very little and it really does not work for my intended use. Now it just sits on the desk to hold small amounts of trash. Will not be good in a bathroom or office.
1,About this product,"This is not a good purchase because once again,,, your not given exactly whats shown in the picture! this picture shows and entire waste can, when you only get the bottom half, and the top half you must purchase to make it look like the picture.. what a complete let down!"
2,"Many features, but the most important feature is not!","Great concept and idea, but the most important feature is not. This product does NOT tune stations very well. There are about 5 radio stations that I listen to, and I could only tune into 1 of them! I thought that it might be due to my location, so I tried it from home. There, I got 2 stations. It's not due to the signal quality from the radio stations because I have a receiver in the same room which was able to tune into those stations with NO problem. The antenna extension did NO good.This product is on it's way back to Amazon."
2,USB Radio,"The RadioShark2 suffers from similar problems that the RadioShark has. My RadioShark2 is located in the second story and gets acceptable, not good by any means, reception on FM. The AM section is almost a total joke! The AM reception is very buzzy, hum filled on a strong AM signal much much worse on a weak AM signal. It is barely acceptable on a station 5 miles from my location. At $70 it would be returned! At $40 it does work to pick up FM stations. It is too bad that the AM section is so awful!! The should be a law preventing such misleading comments from the manufacturer in their description of this product."
3,A great product if you like to listen to radio often.,"The RadioShark works well when the radio signals are very clear. I have had to use the extension cable and even then I hear some static. I thought the reception would have been clearer. When recording I have had to use music editing software to clean out the static that comes from poor reception. A great product if you like to listen to radio often.The Snaptune software gave trouble to install and I deleted it and used the more reliable radioShark software. Overall I am satisfied, but there are many improvements that can be done with his useful tool."
1,Poor AM reception,"Just received Radioshark2. It has very poor AM reception although other radios in the same location have OK reception. The FM reception is just average. Two bonus programs, iFill, Proxi, not received although listed as present on CD.Radioshark2 isn't worth the money. Most likely, I'm going to return it.Milan Kalus"
3,radioShark II,"When it works, it is great. But, it;s not a set it and forget device. I've had to reset in constantly."
3,S-Okay,"It ranks as ""just okay"". Decent reception of local stations, excellent sound quality. Difficult to get installed, setup, working and configured on Win7. (yeah, I know, was never designed for this OS) Easy as pie on my MacMini though. Still, interface of software is LACKING! Come on folks, the old version had a ""seek"" button and the new version does not. Attractive design, pretty blue light that changes to red when you record. Win version is missing the ""pulse"" option that Mac has. Gee, no wonder I switched from WinTel to Mac. LOL"
2,"it might work for you, it might not","the software, the way it looks: great. the reception: awful. major broadcast stations often don't come in at all, and i live in a big city where reception is never a problem. moving the device around, and using its external antenna, you can improve the quality of the signal, but for some stations, no amount of shifting and relocating can deliver sound that is not washed over with static.based on the reviews i've read, in some areas the reception is fine, in others it is terrible. in principle, this is a great little gizmo, but in practice, much depends on your specific location. to sum up, if you want to digitally record radio shows, this could be the right thing, but it might be utterly useless. only buy it if you don't mind risking the hassle of having to send it back."
2,Very Poor AM reception,The reception ranges from OK to barely able to listen. 2 other cheap and old clock radios have near perfect reception in the exact same spot. I would not recommend this for AM listening. I do like the ease of set up and programing.
2,Snarky Shark,"It does not work with Windows 7. When I contacted tech support they had no encouraging words. Just told me to keep checking their web site. But I fiddled around with it and got it to work. Sort of. The AM reception is poor, at best. FM is OK. But Windows Media Center does not see this device, so you can forget about using it with that. Oh well, back to using my 14-transistor battery-operated portable radio to listen to AM sports talk. On the other hand the shark fin is cool when it lights up! Now if I could just make it strobe so I could dance to it . . ."
4,Nifty convergency device - No Win 7 support,"This is an interesting convergence device. It allows you to easily record FM or AM station audio on your computer with the included software. The included software, which is nearly identical on Windows or Mac, allows you to setup tuning presets, control recording quality, setup schedules for recording, etc.I'm not sure how useful the device is, since it doesn't record AM Stereo, HD radio or any of the available digital data streams present on radio today. It also has poor AM reception, but most radios do unfortunately.This device will NOT work under Windows 7. The software can be installed, and the device is recognized, but there is no sound. As others have written here, Griffin Technology has not indicated if or when they will release Windows 7 software. Luckily, it works just fine under Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.6.it's a nifty device if the station(s) you want to listen to don't provide digital streams via the internet."
2,Average reception,"The reception on the RadioShark2 is below average. I was not able to receive many stations which are within a 20-30 mile radius. When I did manage to receive stations, the sound quality was below average due to static noise. Overall, the device works for some stations, but for the most part, fails as a radio."
3,Does not work with Windows 7,I have had the radio shark for over a year and it has worked great for me. I am a radio dj and could record my shows to listen to when I got home. I recently updgraded to windows 7 and now it doesn't work. I contacted Griffin and they told me they don't have software for windows 7 and don't know if they will. Dissapointing because I liked the product.
5,Glad I Ordered!,"Despite hearing about the first version of this product two years ago, I was reluctant to order because many of the reviews on other web pages were not complimentary. If only I had ordered it then. Radioshark 2 worked great. The software was simple, direct, and easy to install. Being able to use it like a regular digital radio was a seamless transition. The time-shifting feature was spot on. The product worked perfectly as advertised with all of our metro-area radio stations. No problems. The reception quality was excellent. The sound quality was very good (it obviously relates to your speaker quality). No dog in this fight, but thought it was worth posting a review because of other negatives I have seen on-line."
1,POS,"It lights up. That's about it for functionality. It barely tunes in FM stations and not one AM station, and I live 10 miles from NYC. Avoid avoid avoid.-C"
1,Promising but falls short,"Easy to install, but as we all know a computer is an extremely noisy electricalenvironment so I was hesitant if it would be a good idea to hook up a radio receiver in the first place.In most cases it works, but it frequently starts crackling and gets a high pitch whine,and you have to disconnect the receiver, plug it in again and usually the noise goes away.Make sure you use a high power USB port.And why is there not any SD version of the receiver available ?The Mac version of the software does not like 'spaces', you can't move it around like you can any other apps.And why no power button ? Maybe the crackle and whine could be avoided by a power cycle without havingto physically unplug/replug it ?Update: Have stopped using this device, the high pitch whine is insanely annoying."
5,best algae sheets ever,"I like Tangs, and my new Blue Powder Tang refused to eat anything but grazing aquarium rocks, I tried several algae sheets brands and she never tasted any, she started to starving!!So I got one of this purple seaweed and surprised that the Tang really liked it, now she start to gain more weight :)"
2,Messy at Times,"Sometimes these will blot and be a little runny after being closed for awhile. They are not bad color wise, they just are messier than my Hi-Liter brand. I bought since they had blue, but I don't think I would buy this brand again."
3,Mediocre,"I ordered these primarily because of the low price ($2.99. The color of the highlighters are not too dark and they generally don't bleed through the page. My one issue with the highlighters is that at the end of each highlighted line, the ink blots/clots up and darkens so that you cannot see the text. Basically the highlighters highlight everything ok, except the last part of the sentence - and when looking back over notes this blotting makes the pages look pretty bad."
2,Great - until they start leaking...,"Every one of the highlighters in this pack is leaking. Not leaking out all over everything, but when you take the lid off, the area of the highlighter that you hold while using it is covered in highlighter ink. It gets all over my hands.The other reviews seem positive, so maybe I just got a bad package - but either way, I'm not happy about it."
4,Great price for great highlighters,These highlighters are perfect for my medical school reading. They are cheaper on Amazon than in the store with free two-day shipping.
4,They're highlighter... what else can I say?,"The colors stand out great (like a highlighter should).Minus 1 star because I found them to be a bit too ""wet"" and will soak through a page when highlighting. Other than that they serve their purpose!"
4,"nice bright colors, chiseled pen tip","I like the bright colors and the chiseled pen tip, but i have to keep replacing them... They do dry out quickly if used often, so now i keep them upside-down in my pencil cup to keep the tips moist. Luckily, they're inexpensive."
5,Highlight away,Very vibrant highlighters. Fast shipping and great price. Now I can highlight away at work without worrying about running out of color.
5,Can't beat the price.,"Not the best highlighters in the world, but at five for under two bucks, I really can't complain. They last me several months, and I use them quite often at work."
4,These highlighters are GREAT!,"These highlighters are GREAT! However, I do have an a minor issue with them.Some colors seem to give off much more ink than the others. I don't know what the issue is, but it is very noticeable on paper! Other than that, I have had no issues with them!"
5,Excellent,My daughter is in college so it is nice to find a deal like this. She loves the size of these because they do not take up so much room in her pencil case.
5,A good buy and convenient.,"I could have run to a store, but wanted to save time. It's not necessary to get this sort of items via Amazon, but it may be a good idea when you have 20 other things to buy for your kids and want to save time."
4,Good but could be a little better,I use these on a daily basis at my job. At first they seemed to be the best but I've noticed that recently they seem to stop working or dry up quickly. BIC is known for quality to hopefully they improve these soon as I do like the BIC brand for sure.
3,Quality is not what it used to be,"The pens arrived in awesome time and they work just fine. But the construction, grip, and overall feel just isn't as good as it used to be. I see other folks have had poor longevity with this product. I will wait to see how these fare, but I can tell that they are not really well built. Oh well, they were like 2 bucks so I can live with that."
4,runs out of ink quickly,"The highlighters have bright and have great highlighting capability; however, they run out of ink pretty quickly (after ~2 weeks of usage)"
2,Hey Bic- What happened? These just don't last,"Are highlighters old school? Maybe, but I like them. I've been using Sharpie Accents for years. I was attracted to the Brite Lighters because a) they have a nice selection of colors and b) I've always found Bic to be a solid, reputable brand. But these highlighters are terrible ! And I didn't just end up with a bad batch. The ink literally runs out within a week or two of useand one is stuck with a dried up non-usable marker. I must admit I'm surprised, because Bic pens have always been fairly reliable-- but it's back to Sharpies for me."
1,"Cheap Price, Cheap Quality","I got these highlighters because I am in school and need to differentiate different parts of what I am reading. After using them only a few times, most of them have started to leak from the tip and get highlighter ink all over my hands! I've resorted to carrying around a napkin in my pencil bag with me so I can wipe them off before I use them in order to avoid the mess. Because they're so cheap I won't bother to return them, but when these run out, I'll be spending the few extra dollars for some highlighters that won't leave my hands looking like I just went finger painting."
3,multi faceted,"Like a fine emerald, this small book is tiny and has many facets to it. Also like even the finest of emeralds, it does have flaws and weak spots. However, due to the wide range of stories, from fey to the far reaches of space to vampires, what is seen as a lesser story by one might be just what another person loves. There is something to appeal to each taste in the broad spectrum of sci fi fans. Most stories are under ten pages, some as brief as two, and there are several thought provoking poems. Fans of the Analog magazine are sure to be pleased by reading this book. Despite its comical title, most of the stories are serious in nature, not at all lightweight. Particurly enjoyable was Mother of a New Generation. This was one of the snippets that would benefit from possibly being expanded to book length."
4,Good basic stuff,"I enjoyed reading this book. Pretty much what you expect from a basic romance novel. Less than 200 pages, perhaps that's normal for a silhuette issue; most other novels I've read recently are longer. Anyway, nice read for in between."
4,excellent introduction to how residential streets evolved,"This books describes the history and evolution of residential streets in the US and Britain. It remains very objective, until the last chapter when the authors push for the shared streets concept. As a transportation planning professional, I found it very informative and compelling. It did the impossible: it changed my mind on the value of cul-de-sacs."
5,Good source for a student,"I have purchased several products from A2ZCDS in the past and as a student, I find that these are very helpful. If you are looking for a product to help get you through a project or a term paper, A2ZCDS provides just that. Plus, it is very convenient."
4,Being the Parent You Want to Be,"Easy to read, concise material on turning ""wanting to be a good parent"" to ""being a good parent"". Positive support and encouragement to try different techniques to communicate in a directive and positive manner with opportunities to practice your new skills. Good story example at the end of how one family practically applied the skills learned. Lots of good phrases to use. I've updated my skills and intend to use some of the strategies with my teens!"
1,"could have been more readable, more juicy","This book seemed intriguing, and promised secrets, but left me feeling unfulfilled. The writing dragged, and made the few facts i learned uninteresting. Basically bonesman helped each other out in Washington with job connections, but it seems that you need connections for most jobs, especially in Washington, whether through fraternities, sororities, alumni, friends, whatever. The book has a nice cover, but inside could use either more exciting prose or a more exciting story."
1,A must read for insomniacs,"This book is a long winded love letter to Yale and its insular, self congratulatory traditions. The book avoids the troubling implications of S&B instead providing ample details of its long ivy clad history as seen through the eyes of one of its adoring grads."
1,Who Knew A Legendary Secret Society Could Be So Dull?,"For being a book about The Skull and Bones secret society, this book was frighteningly dull. It was as if she was committed to writing a book about this society, initially thinking that it would be engaging, but then she researched (and OH BOY did she research) and wrote it, only to discover that it was actually a pretty boring subject, but hey, she might as well get paid.If you're looking for a (very dry) history of the Skull and Bones written by someone who won't ever let you forget that they also went to Yale (Which is where the Skull and Bones is. At Yale. Where the write went to school. Yale. Where the Skull and Bones is. Did I mention Yale yet?), this book will suffice."
2,takes all the fun out of secret societies and conspiracy theories,"I definitely enjoyed Alexandra Robbins' other books, however ""Secrets of the Tomb"" is not a fun read. Robbins is long winded and lacks the narrative that is so entertaining in ""Pledged"" and ""The Overachievers."" The book takes a historical perspective that is too detailed and not very direct, creating a lot of build-up for describing a boring society and ritual. Since Robbins was herself a member of a secret society the book is written with an undercurrent of reverance that seems to bar the author from revealing too much."
2,Lack of research skills,"Alexandra Robbins' book is largely a history of the organisation. It goes into very little detail on what members have actually done, and the advantages of membership. The research is not of a great standard, there is no probing. It is limited to surface scratching. As a member of Scroll and Key, she does provide some insights into the elitist state of mind of secret society members.I would recommend buying one of the other books on the Order."
1,most likely One of the 1st Female Bones members,"This book is supposedly an expose about the Skull and Bones, and clouds the reader with more fiction then fact."
1,Nothing Secret and Nothing hidden here--So What!,"I found myself reflecting on what a former English professor of mine once said that ""if you find yourself saying one too many so whats, then the piece you are reading isn't worth it."" I found Alexandra Robbin's Secret Of The Tomb fell into this category. Her accounts of those she interviewed as well those she felt benefitted from Yale's secret society is nothing new to many of us. I felt she had not broken through the ""wall of confidentiality"" from those she interviewed. That is why she spent so much time on boring history from the 1700-1800's and William Russell and his admiration of a German secret society. What makes me laugh the most about Robbin's accounts of the Skull and Bones is, as a Yale graduate and member of a secret society herself, she has benefitted from Yale's elitist entitlement to power and prestige. You are better off just reading the summary of the book as it appeared on MSNBC. But then again--So What!"
1,hugely disappointed,"I found this book to be a huge disappointment and a waste of time. I heard a recommendation on Pacifica radio in LA which I highly respect, but the book totally lacked insight. Alexandra Robbins includes tedious details such as, the spending budget of Skull and Bones, meaningless quotes from alumni over the years which I found erroneous. The book lacks focus. The only point I could find the author attempting to make was that the myths of these elitist Yale societies are perpetuated by the societies themselves, and I could have figured that out in about a sentence or two."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Man alive this book is just lacking in fine details. If you really want to now about the Skull and Bones there are much better books out there. Just one persons opinion here, but do yourself a favor and look at the other authors that write books on this subject."
2,HISTORY OF YALE ?,"Alexandra Robbins is a gifted writer but as a whole, this book was a bit of a disappointment. As other reviewers have noted, too much time was spent on the History of Yale University that you have to ask if this book was really aptly titled. Robbins manages to dispel a few of the myths and penetrates some of the mystique but, I certainly didn't walk away from this book feeling like I'd really learned any ""secrets"" about the Skull and Bones society. I'm not deeply familiar with S & B as a whole but, something tells me that ""Secrets of the Tomb"" is hardly the final say on the S & B."
2,Lots of old names and dates but nothing new,"Interesting, well written, and a smooth read; however, much of the historical detail seems excessive and many readers will skim over what is written. If accurate it might be recommended to S&B bothers themselves, not to the general public. The title is a catchy promise - but I expected a lot more."
1,"Bad, empty and misguided.","Arrogant and clueless pseudojournalist embarks on an ""adventure"" and ends up being led by the nose and fed misinformation by ""good ole' frat boys"" - one could sum up this bad, poorly written (with some truly atrocious sins against syntax) ""book"" thusly...As for factual *information* about the Skulls, one can find more for free even at Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_and_Bones - where there are links to *real* journalists' investigations of the ""Boners"", as I prefer to call the S&Bs.; For instance - http://www.observer.com/pages/story.asp?ID=6085"
3,Introductory,"I found this book somewhat interesting, but purely introductory. The author alludes all through the book to the fact that she is a member of one of these societies, but seems to just glaze over the surface. It does give a little insight to a world that most of us will never enter."
5,Excellent and Gripping Read,"Conspiracy theorists may not be happy with this book. But people who want to know about Skull & Bones at Yale will learn almost everything that is publicly known about Skull & Bones.Ms. Robbins is a Yale graduate. She interviewed many Bonesmen while researching this book. There is a lot of Yale and Skull & Bones history in this book. In fact Chapter 2 gives a little too much history of Yale.There are a lot of interesting facts in this book. There are a couple lines about W that are pretty hilarious.Level headed, even keel people interested in this fraternity will love Secrets of the Tomb."
1,Save your money,"I bought this book thinking that I would find out some great secrects about the ""Tomb"" or maybe even a major political conspiracy or two.....but no. I kept reading & reading & reading (I even skippen about 50 pages of worthless, extremely boring history about Yale)& never got to anything really juicy. If you REALLY want to read it, borrow it from the library."
1,Trite conspiracy theory,"This book is complete nonsense. A substandard author, Robbins relies on sensationalism and rumors to fool the reader into believing that she actually knows what she is talking about.It's fun to read in the sense that it's completely outrageous in its allegations.The Skull and Bones is just another fraternity. All frat brothers help each other out in the business and political worlds. My frat helped me get into law school. And they all have stupid little ornaments. Hell, even my frat claimed to have the skullof Clarence Darrow. It's absurd to think that they had anything to do with the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima, or the founding of the CIA, or the Kennedy assasination. She offers no proof whatsoever, just information from ""sources"" that happen to coincide with the events. Do not neglect all the other facts about these events."
2,A very slow read.,"The book was well written. However, I feel that she spent too much time quoting other sources and documents from the past. This was an extremely slow read for me. To me it just seemed like the author had a touch of jealousy having been in one of the OTHER secret societies. If you don't mind MANY excerpts from other sources, then maybe this book is for you."
1,An Agonizing Read -- Fake reviews abound,"The book has an intriguing cover and title. The introduction was captivating. Sadly, it's all downhill from there -- it reads like the minutes of a long and unproductive meeting.Apparently, the author has succeeded in recruiting her friends to leave contrived reviews. Of the 28 which rated this book at 5-stars, 15 were anonymous and 9 had this book as their only reviewed work. That leaves 4 people who unquestionably enjoyed it -- the editor, her parents, and boyfriend. The others are suspect."
2,The book that never got off the ground,"I checked this item out at the library. No money wasted, but I should have read Amazon reviews before committing hours to the book that never got off the ground. Like other reviews stated, I was hooked at the opening scene. It was written like a suspense novel. I settled in with anticipation. Quickly the tone changed and never returned. The review ""Mostly filler, with little interesting content,"" November 28, 2005, By Michael Moore is a perfect review for this book. The book deserves one more star though. Content aside, the writing was error free and held my attention while I waited for the pow that never came."
2,Just as others said - quite the disappointment...,I was looking for some interesting insight but found very little in this book. It provides the basics of the society and what I'm sure is public knowledge but no insider information... Generally disappointing.
1,very disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading this book and getting some insight into what really goes on when one enters into the Skull and Bones. This book, however, was useless. It was endlessly boring and gave very little new insight. Like one reviewer mentioned, she just barely scratched the surface and she seemed to have no interest in delving any deeper.Save your money!"
1,"Trash, verbose trash at that.","This book promises to unearth the secrets of on of the most well known of secret society. Instead it mentions rumors, causally glances over facts, and quotes a few uninteresting sources. All of this is delivered with the air of a policeman at a crime scene muttering ""Nothing to see here, move along, move along."" The only true `facts' consist of very long detailed connections between the members of Skull and Bones and their careers. There is an entire chapter devoted to George W and his business investments, ending with dollar amounts donated to his presidential campaign by other SaB members. At the end of over 208 pages of dull writing, punctuated with endless quotes from Yale journals in the 1800s, you are left with only one amazing fact.Naples Pizza has a dance floor? Stunning!And now I'm left with one additional mystery. Why did I waste my time reading this book?"
2,Disappointing,"I was really excited to read this book, especially since the author is from Yale herself. The book reads like a dry dissertation--not very entertaining. Also, it takes forever to get down to what Skull and Bones is all about, first you have to get through a few chapters that deal with secret societies in general. Ultimately disappointing."
2,Poor writer,"The book spends too much time on the history of Yale. The book is poorly written and goes on to explain the obvious. Skull and Bones is a social club, made up of rich and elite individuals. For some reason they gave the author access that had always been prohibited in the past. Why? To tell their story through the words and name of an anonymous person, not associated with the club. How can I believe what the author is saying when so many others have said different. A cleverly written book may have been more convincing, even with the same thesis. Try other books on the same topic if this stuff interests you."
2,Misses the mark greatly,"If you have always been fascinated by secret societies, then this book is a cheap thrill, as long as you skip through some of the tedious chapters on Yale.Rather than offering substantial insights on Skull and Bones, the author goes on and on about the greatest of Yale itself for ""context."" The author presents a thesis that secret societies are a natural outgrowth of Yale's own tradition in producing great leaders.While I agree that Yale has produced many political leaders (just look at the current Presidential candidates), it has never crossed my mind in my wildest imagination, that somehow Yale was a hotbed for leadership. (Once again, just look at the Presidential candidates.....yes they have been in leadership positions....but can anyone honestly say that they have been ""great"" leaders?)Clearly the thesis of the book is a product of a naive, young writer, herself a Yale graduate and Secret Society member, who is too enamored with Yale to provide an objective view."
5,Disability awareness is alive,A great resource for any kid or parent that has struggled with disability issues. There is nothing like this out there anywhere! These are kids and their mentor telling their own stories with all of the dignity they possess and deserve. Kudos to all involved for their truth and commitment to people in our world that want to be understood.
4,I totaly reccomend this cd!,This cd is great. I enjoyed almost everything about from the horns to the vocals. It is sad that great bands like this break up before they get the recognition they deserve. Fans of awsome ska bands such as Reel Big Fish and Jeffries Fan Club would lovw this album.
4,before you knew better ist better,"Even though I really liked this CD (otherwise I wouldn't have given it 4 stars), their first CD was better. Still - pretty good ska."
2,WORTHLESS,THe only reason why this Cd has any worth whatsoever is Veronica Sawyer... the rest absolulety blows... especially the first track
5,An awsome little Long Island band!!!!,"I have seen them several times at concerts, they are an awsome group. At one of the concerts I bought their new CD, it was so awsome, I'm trying to get their first one, but this one is totally hot. I strongly recomend anyone who is into punk and ska to get this, it is very good!"
1,i know one groovy coconut and your no one groovy coconut,"eegads whats goin on.... kids should not be allowed to make albums ska is ska and pop ska is best left for bands like one groovy coconut or the slackers to play, thats modern ska. thats modern pop music, this is am radio tiny sounding thin trash, the singer sounds like he's struggling thru puberty. i guess the rest of the reviews on this page wont help sales. better luck after you get some facial hair."
2,Not a great comeback.,"This album was not a great follow up to their first album. It sounds classical rather than good ska, like their first cd. It isn't very catchy, but some of the songs are alright."
1,please god make it stop,"Now, i don't like rap or hip hop. However, i was subjected to this song 'ditty' a few years ago. Now it's stuck in my head and the only way i can get it out is by blowing it out. With a bullet. I hate the ditty."
1,Sucked.......,"This cd basically was not good rap.....Ditty is pretty good though, but that is the only good trait of this album. Buy the single and don't wast e your money on the whole ablum."
3,Dittty ditty litty bitty,"This is a example of a one hit song ""Ditty"" that still gets radio play today. Most of the songs on the album are weak. I do love the the ""Nine Yards"". My favorite track on the album and which I feel is better than ditty. But what can you say? Paper Boy is classic 90's pop rap."
3,Indoor Tanning Lotion,"This is a great product, and it smells great right out of the bottle, but after you put it on and get in the tanning bed, you begin to stink unbelievably....Other indoor tanning lotions that I have used have never smelled this bad after use....But, as far as giving you a nice tan, it does do a wonderful job on your tan...and it looks great....But as far as the smell, as soon as you step out of the tanning bed, you stink up the whole place...and everyone smells you....and have made comment...I would hope that they would continue to make this product, but Please work on the smell....."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I purchased these much-desired dolls for my 2 daughters 2 Christmasses ago only to discover after a few plays online that they were VERY disappointed in the online interaction(or lack thereof)compared to the other online toys they play with (WebKinz, BuildABear, Littlest Pet Shop, EPets, etc...). I was very annoyed & angry that I had gotten them a toy(that was NOT cheap by any means!) that they had so looked forward to and were so disappointed in.If your child just wants the doll for the doll itself, great. However, if she's looking for the fun interactive play online, SKIP IT! Get her/him a Webkinz or Build A Bear(GREAT site) instead!"
1,Boo! For not being Mac-compatible,"My daughters are of the age where they're spending time on the computer, exploring the internet (supervised, of course), and are into all things computery and video-gamey. We are a family of Mac users, and have been since 1984. I want my kids to be computer ""bi-lingual""; they have access to PCs and Windoze at school. That being said, my daughters' birthdays are coming up, and I thought for sure they'd love to have this product.Unfortunately, it isn't compatible with Mac, so that means neither sets of grandparents can buy it as well as us, and other relatives. So ""thumbs down"" to MGA for being so discriminating against Mac users!"
4,She liked it when when we finally got it to work!,"We bought one of these for our daughter and tried to connect to the website via our laptop. We could not. We tried to connect via another laptop with the same negative result. We were going return it to the store, but I decided to first try it out on our desktop. Wonders of wonders - we got in with no problem and our daughter is now ""as happy as a clam at high water"".Has anyone else had this situation where the item works on one computer, but not another? The only initial significant difference I can determine is that our older desktop uses Windows XP Home Edition and the laptops use Windows XP Media Center Edition. When I get the opportunity, I'm going to investigate further and try to ascertain what is the true issue, and if there is a fix...unless someone out there already has a solution and wishes to share, please, oh please!!"
5,Amazing album,an amazing album Tonedeff is really talent doing his own production rapping and singingLots of stand out tracks especially Porcelain which is one of the best tracks ive heard in a long time his flow on that track is perfect
5,The New Hip Hop,"If you're looking for an album that actually plays like an album from front to back, ""Archetype"" by Tonedeff is a great buy. The ability to have flow throughout an entire album is a lost art and Tonedeff has to be the most underrated artist in hip hop today. He uses many elements from other genres of music such as singing and live orchestration. This album is great not only for hip hop fans but also for music fans in general.Tonedeff truly showcases his talent as an artist and displays what an artist should try and do. That is to push the boundaries and standards in an attempt to bring about something better. As you'll hear from him soon enough, ""Change is good...it will not kill you."" If you want to experience something different (in addition to being amazing music as opposed to being different for the sake of being different) for a change, pick up a copy of ""Archetype."""
3,nothing short of mediocre,"Boy what a disppointment. if you liked the first one this is gonna bring you down. No fast stuff here, I say if it ain't broke don't fix it. they had what i consider the greatest swing album and they just couldn't match it. One hit wonders come and go lets hope they turn the ship back before its too late. is this a kids album with songs like old Mac donald and Jungle book? I mean experimentation is cool but don't forget what got you there...Come on guys pick up the energy just a bit huh?"
5,I love this album!!! Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is by far the best,"I love Big Bad Voodoo Daddy!! I always swing my songs tho them!! This album is great. It is more layed back then their first one, but it still has the jive of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy !!!!!"
3,"Good, but not as good","This cd is very good, but is much less than their last release, it lacks that upbeat swing feel we're so used to with BBVD. Pick up this cd for some great slow stuff, but for fast upbeat swing dance type music, go with theire previous album"
2,It's not Swing,"The group sounds like they've heard a couple of early R&B sides and with a dab of mid '40's New York style Dixieland called themselves a swing band. But they don't swing. As a Rock off shoot they arent bad. But no one should confuse what they are doing with Swing. Swing is what Basie did, What Kenton even did,and Herman and Dizzie and Goodman, etc"
3,"Some highlights, but a number of ho-hum tunes","The newness of the CD has worn off, and I just realized it's just OK. In comparison to their debut album that really shines, this one only glimmers here and there. The tunes aren't as catchy, and the best ones were written by other people. My favorite track: Just Like You, of Disney's Jungle Book fame. BBVD is extremely talented, and because this release still shows some of that talent, I still give this release 3 stars. However, if you want the best BBVD has to offer, buy their first album."
3,great for bbvd fans! okay for dancing?,"More great music from the Great Band. Although this is more music to dance to, it just doesn't seem to be as interesting as their first album. There are a few tracks on here that are great, so it's worth buying if you're a great Big Bad fan... but if you just like to swing dance, I'd suggest the first album over this one. Although, if you do get this cd, listen to the second to last track, Sleep Tight. Ahhhh, that's a great song....."
3,Few good songs,"I just recieved the album ""This Beautiful Life"". I was a bit disapointed though. This ablum is nowhere as good a ""Americana Duluxe"". If are buying a BBVD ablum go for the older ones.The only reason I gave this album 3 stars is becuase there is a few really good songs in it like ""Big and Bad"" or ""Who's That Creepin'?"""
2,Disappointing,"I'm quite a fan of big-band swing music, both classic and recent. After their self-titled first album, I considered Big Bad Voodoo Daddy to be among the greatest swing bands of modern times. I'm forced to rethink that by this album. The musical and vocal talent remains, but the fire of their first album is gone. Except for ""Just Like You,"" this album feels more like slow jazz than swing. Unless you're a devoted BBVD fan, you're better off buying the first album and waiting for the third."
2,"Comparitavly, it's worth no stars","Compared to their first album, BBVD has gone WAY downhill. Morris's vocals are worse than useul, the band has NO music songs (everything is a lyrical rock) and the swing is gone. It's really sad. The only reason I give this the stars it has are because of the three good songs on it (Big and Bad, I'm not sleeping and What's Next) which actually sound a little like swing. Hopefully the boys will pull it together for thier next album and go back to what worked in the first place."
1,WHAT a DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I have waited for BBVD's new album for months, and I have never been more disappointed in an album than I was when I listened to this one. I kept waiting for the SWING, the GOOD TIMES which their debut album had. -- Maybe the next song --but no...another dud. Goofball rhymes, odd rhythms, no swing. eeIeeI-oh. Scotty, listen up. You are not a song writer. This album sounds like a huge vanity trip for you, and you haven't earned it yet. Go back to your roots, and put out a real swing album before all is lost."
4,Do you know this is their THIRD album?,"Great album, but everyone is comparing it to the previous thinking THAT was their first album. Wrong kids, they had their first disc come out in 1994 on their own label. Good luck finding it though. :)"
4,Solid Album,I've only listened to the CD once but it seems to be solid. The 1st and 3rd Cuts are pretty weak but the rest of the CD is consistent with the 1st Album. I will have to listen a couple of more times to tell whether I like it as good as the first but judging from the 1st listen it is not. Still good though
2,Big Bad Voodoo Daddy not as good second time around.,"As a big fan of swing, and of this band, I was very excited to make my purchase. I got the cd, went out to my car, and popped it in. It was downhill from there. I'm sad to say that Big Bad's new release hardly lives up to their first cd, which I think is just awesome. I found only one catchy tune on the new album; Number eight, ""Big Time Operator,"" is a pretty good song, but in no way comes close to ""You and Me..."" or ""Mr. Pinstripe Suit."". I wanted to love this cd, but instead am pretty disappointed. Maybe this is a sign of things to come, and that swing is dying out... I hope not. Or maybe Scotty and the boys are just having a tough sophomore year."
1,Sophomore Slump,"Since I loved BBVD's first CD, I eagerly rushed out to buy their new one. What a total disappointment. I don't mind that they're trying to mix up different kinds of music. An experiment like that could be interesting. But the problem with this CD is simple: It's BORING! It's a total snoozer. I can't play it in my car because it will put me to sleep when I'm driving. This band sounds like they're becomng too self-indulgent. A complete letdown."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"These guys are ABSOLUTELY incredible if you're into the new age swing scene. I was fortunate enough to see them live in San Diego, and they performed half the tracks on this CD there, which was PHENOMENAL. If you like jazz/swing and Jump Blues/Jump swing, these guys are a DEFINITE must for your collection. They DO tend to play a lot of cover tracks of old Louis Prima, Cab Calloway, etc...But they revive the old tunes and throw new hits of their own in to bring swing into the new millennium!"
5,Swing,"BBVD Has Done It With This Album! This 7 Piece Band Has Really Hit The Jackpot With This Record. With A Wonderful Horn Section, And Loads Of Talent This Is Really A Great Album. I Don't Have Much More To Say About It Except For: It's A Spectacular Album And Swing Is Coming Back!"
2,a mere shadow of the first effort,"very few moments of inspriation, nothing memorable; I was honestly disappointed."
3,Major Dud,"I love BBVD and am even a friend of Josh's (the pianist), but this album was not even close to the last. I love the band and love their music, but what happened here. The vocals are about as boring as the teacher you had for U.S. government in school. I don't know if they were in a hurry to get this album released or what, but I was disappointed with every song. And who wants to here Old McDonald from a swing band. I still consider BBVD to be the best new swing band, but I guess I will just have to wait for the next album and hopefully it will have some heart behind it. BBVD needs some original tunes without the paraphrasing of older blues artists."
2,"Not as Big, not as Bad, and definatly not as Voodoo!","I just loved their self-titled CD and thought that the next one would surpass it, but no. BBVD is the only swing I listen to besides old New Orleans Rhthym Kings vinyls my grandfather gave me, and this just doesn't cut it. I'm a big fan of rock and alternative, but it seems that my only swing joint has been stubbed out in an ashtray called originality. BBVD has heart, and some energy, but the songs need to be a lot better to get hits or lots of attention. Good only if you're a hardcore swinger."
5,A Medical Perspective on Homosexuality,"I like this DVD because it gives an expert position on homosexuality by physicians, and provides evidence to back up their claims that reparitive ""ex-gay"" therapies, are largely unsuccessful. It's also short, around 30 minutes, and offers case studies and experiences of those who have gone through conversion therapies. I would recommend it to any physician or psychologist or therapist working with homosexuals, bisexuals, and transgendered people, as well as for organizations such as PFLAG to show that people are normal for being gay, and do not need to be ""cured."""
5,Best yet,I've watched quite a bit of material on the ex-gay movement and also being Christian and gay. Even though the content has been good the production standards have let the message down. Abomination did not let me down at all. Excellent work and perfect mix of personal stories plus leading experts in their fields. Thanks for this important contribution in de-constructing the ex-gay myth and putting faces to many of the authors I've read.Anthony Venn-BrownCo-founder of Freedom2b.orgFounder and Director of Ambassadors & Bridge Builders InternationalAuthor of 'A Life of Unlearning - A Journey to Find the Truth'Twice voted one of the 25 Most Influential Gay & Lesbian Australians
2,Looks good but warps,"The pan showed up with a dent, then as you season it and start using it, the pan gets more and more warped like a U. To the point where when you put in the stock you have to be very careful or else it will spill out one side.I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Buyer beware,"There are several problematic areas. Packaging is very poor as it consists of white cloth and a gluded lable that is bound to fall off and get stained,& the actual CDs lack the songs written on them. Naturally, there are many highlights, but the attempt to mix rare cuts, out takes, excellent cuts of well known jams, such as Eyes, Cassidy, and Shakedown, and free-form jams is bound to be unfocused. I love the rare cuts, but as far as the rest is concerned, there really are too many other versions and sources for any deadhead with a decent collection to invest hard-earned cash on this. On a more positive light, this collection could be worse. If I could have only 6 hours of Dead to listen to, I could not do a much better job in selection. Think hard about spending the cash for this."
4,Great Set,"I almost didn't buy this box set after reading some of the negative reviews here. Man, that would have been a huge mistake! This is a wonderful set. Sure it has it's rough spots but they are far outweighed by the many moments of brilliance, humor, beauty, and audacity. I've been around the block with The Dead a few times and am a bit critical of many things Dead but not this box set. It's not perfect but neither were The Dead. I think I read in one of these reviews that you can only listen to so many versions of the Other One (or some other song). Not true! Too much is never enough. I do agree that Dick's Picks should be your first foray into live Dead on CD, but this makes the list. Buy it(if not now, eventually)."
4,Dead in a nutshell,"Fascinating career-spanning compilation of previously unreleased material that encapsulates much of what was great (and not so great) about this band. Like the Dead, this is most interesting when it's creative and experimental (Watkins Glen Soundcheck Jam), sweet and melancholy (Beautiful Jam/To Lay Me Down), tough and bluesy (The Same Thing), or congenial and relaxed (Whiskey in the Jar). Make sure to check out the gorgeous Days Between and So Many Roads towards the end of the last disc; two of Jerry's last and most poignant ever performances."
4,"Some great points, some rough points","The beautiful jam and soundcheck jam are both incredible! Basically the best stuff is on discs two and three. There is too much concentration on 80's material that (not in general, but on this box set) pales to some of the 70's stuff they could have included. There is nothing from 1977? one of the Dead's best years. Still this box provides enough peaks to warrent its purchase by Deadheads and casual fans alike."
4,A very good boxed set,"You have to admire the way this set was put together- trying not to duplicate what Deadheads already own and presenting 5 discs worth of unreleased and rare material. There really is a lot of great music in here and a great variety as well.In the extensive liner notes to the set, the compilers admit there's not enough Pigpen in it- WHY DIDN'T THEY PUT MORE PIGPEN SONGS THEN??? This is a great set that could have even greater if they included more early material and more Pigpen. 4.5 Stars- very very good but by their own admission, they could have done better in their choice of material."
2,Great if you loved the aimless jams,"If this were a concert it would not even be in my top twenty. The editors of this collection spent way too much time on obscure jams, interminable breaks, soundchecks, and even some pretty horrible vocals which (admit it Deadheads, we all heard them) we used to put up with in the occasional bad show. I looked forward to ""The Wheel"" as there aren't too many good published recordings of it. Unfortunatley, Donna and Jerry both sounded like they had been hit by a bus before the show. Phil's ""The Phil Zone"" actually had more memorable Dead moments on it - and it was only two CDs! A retrospective may sell well, but no one needs this many unremarkable jams and mindless soundchecks in their collection."
3,Heh?,"Did I read right that this box set will be re-released in 2010??????? That's four years from now, as I write this! How in Jerry's name do they know that so far in advance?!"
5,SO Many Roads,"Christmas is not for another six months so you need another excuse for someone to get you this album. ""SO Many ROads"" must be added to your collection. The album brings us through thirty years of wonderful music from the boys. It's a little pricey but the sound quality is great and it's worth the penny."
4,Useful for Everyone,"Dr. Glasser's approach to psychiatry and counseling is, in today's world, unorthodox as he eschews medication and time wasted reliving useless past events. Dr. Glasser, with some real examples demonstrates the healing can be accomplished in a few sessions dealing directly with the presenting problem and the choices everyone of us make on a daily basis. Dr. Glasser believes that many physical disorders and caused by the patient's poor choices. This is an excellent book for both professional counselors and lay people."
3,Good foundational ideas,"This work certainly shows its age, which is to be expected from a book written in 1965. Reality Therapy has man strong foundational therapeutic ideas that have been incorporated into other far more 'realistic' approaches to therapy, but it is still important for any aspiring therapist to be well-versed on the history of their field.That said, this work shouldn't be taken and applied as-is. Instead, search for more recent works which focus on more applicable therapies."
3,"Great Idea, but not complete","Vocabulary Power Plus is a great idea, but the book is not complete. There's no answer key for those ambiguous SAT skills passages! How do you know if your answer is correct? I like the connection to the SAT, but it would be nice to have more basic practice with the new word: sentence completion, true-false,and matching."
1,I am disgusted!,"I am a professional writer with 20 years experience, national writing credits and 2 published books. I attempted to help my daughter with her homework and was amazed that this book presented questions that were subjective instead of objective and in some cases, I felt the ""right"" answers were just plain wrong. I am now actively campaigning to get the school district to drop this series."
5,A way to change your heart forever,"I find myself very inspired by the example of the Kadampa practitioners in this book, who managed to change their hearts through meditation. The meditation on equalizing self with others - recognizing that everyone equally wants to be happy and free from suffering - made a big difference to my life the moment I started to try and do it. The other meditations in the sequence are also enormously practical, as well as enormously effective. I've come to figure out from my own limited experience that it really must be possible to change your heart, for good. Kudos to Geshe Kelsang for being so accurate and precise in his instructions - something I have also noticed from the other books of his that I have read."
5,"Excellent, Authoritative Instructions",I have read many books on Buddhism and found many to be obscure and difficult to understand. I loved reading many of them but still did not gain an understanding I was hoping for. Those commentaries authored by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso are more lucid and clear than any I have previously read. I have come to understand more about the Buddhist path to Enlightenment from his texts than any others.
5,Solid and nice,"I purchased three of these for a new house. They look really nice and solid. Installation was a bit difficult, but I've never installed these by myself so maybe it was just my own learning curve. I'm happy with them and a friend said it looked really nice and stylish."
5,Nice looking,I bought this to go with other devonshire items for a bathroom remodel. It was easy to install and looks as nice as everything else in the collection. Very classy.The only drawback is the cost. That is typical with Kohler.
2,"One Paul Up, The Other Paul Down...A Kinder Gentler Free...","Yes this has been remixed; and yes it has been remastered.But, in the process Paul Kossoff's guitar has been toned down and buried slightly in the mix in favor of Paul Rodger's vocals.Andy Fraser's bass is also softened up in the mix.When I first listened to the cd I thought it was some sort of 90's remake of the classic Free songs with some of the original members (ala Blue Oyster Cult ""Cult Classics""). I read the liner notes and realized Bob Clearmountain had remixed the original songs. There is a real ""elevator"" music quality to the finished product. Personally I am very disappointed. If you want the original songs in all their glory look for the ""Free Story"" box or ""Molten Gold"". If you want a kindler, gentler Free than this cd is for you."
5,A real Gem!,I absolutely agree with the first reviewer. Few rock songs have the visceral impact of 'Wishing Well' and 'All Right Now'. The rest of the list is amazingly good. Where did these geniuses come from? Superb remastering! Cough up the 25 bucks and you won't be sorry. No other rock music drives its beat into your soul better than this.
5,Travel in time,Intriguing plot and theme. This book will make you think! Authors understanding of characterization and his unique style make this book well worth reading in themselves. Don't wait for the movie read the book.
4,"Fantastic photographs for old fans , good primer for new fans!","This book is the 1984 ""companion"" to Armando Gallo's classic and authoritative Genesis history, ""I Know What I Like"". This time, he opens his collection of photographs of the band to a representative fan, Dan Smith, who helped choose which images would tell the story of Genesis from their beginnings to circa 1983/84 tour. Gallo is a professional photographer for a reason and his appreciation for the band is apparent in these lovely images, many are quite rare. The only downside is that the text is kept minimal, with a few sentences extracted from his earlier book, meaning casual fans won't get the whole story, but rather just the highlights. But for a photobook, this is just beautiful! There's also a few pages of photos from another amateur photographer, who happens to be a grandmother from Colorado!Apparently quite rare (mine was published in Japan by a d.i.y. company), but if you can find it, this is a beauty!"
1,1 Star for fake college record and liar,"Fake college record, she probabley had this book written and india but didn't give credit to them also.Shame on you!!!!Book Sucks!1 StarDon't Buy."
1,Co-author Marilee Jones lied about her academic credentials!,"A Dec 7, 2009 NYT article titled ""Former Dean Resurfaces, Leaving Scandal Behind"" says ""Two and a half years ago, Marilee Jones, the highly regarded dean of admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, vanished from public sight when it came to light that nearly three decades earlier, when she was first hired there, she had lied about her academic credentials."" ... ""According to M.I.T., Ms. Jones, 58, had on various occasions represented herself as having degrees from three upstate New York institutions: Albany Medical College, Union College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In fact, she had no degrees from any of those places -- only a 1973 bachelor's degree, in biology, from the College of St. Rose, an independent college in Albany, where she grew up. ""Well, that's one way to reduce the stress of getting into a good college - lie!Buyer beware!"
2,a note from the author,I would just like to say to anyone interested in this book that what you are buying is my bad horror film from college here. Many film students in college make that really bad horror film while in college this is mine but in book form. If you do buy this I just want to say thank you and that my next endeavor is leaps and bounds better. But I have been told to look at it like this someone was willing to publish it so it must have some merit.
1,Whoo Hooo! Stinker!,"Read this book after going to a convention. It's terrible. The entire book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. When you go with a self-publisher, (...) you should either do a little editing or up the amount you pay them to publish you to include some editing(...)"
5,Good Product,There very warm for sure but they are pretty heavy too. Well built construction just as good as carhartt. I've had a walls coat for years and still holding up.
2,An okay watch,"I found it a little hard to keep me 100% interested. It was okay, not a bad one but just okay."
4,"Typical, but I liked it","Typical ""B"" creature feature; which I like. Fun but not ""deep"". If you want an artsy fartsy movie with meaning....look elsewhere."
5,Dug It,"I'm a fan of low budget horror films. I'm especially fond of films that take chances. Growth did. There were scares and thrills and interesting characters. I especially liked the camera work. I found the special features to be enlightening and fun. All in all, glad I bought it."
5,Black Mirror,"This is one of the better games for me. It flows well, is interesting and has great graphics. The puzzels are solvable, not too easy, just solvable."
2,Uggggh!!,"Oh hey....can any game suck more?? I got drawn into the spooky box cover and the story description on the back. Aha...but looks are deceiving. Once I started to play, well what a disappointment. First off, I hate games in which I am in essence the ""director"" always clicking the character to go here and there and waiting for him to actually get there. I actually think my clicker-finger has suffered damage...lol! And then there's the endless dialogs ----blah,blah,blah! I found myself telling the charecter (Samual Gordon) to shut-up. What a waste of time.Oh sure,the sound was good and the graphics were ok, but that didn't make-up for the lousy story line. I do have more complaints about the game, but I think you all get my drift on it. What a waste...the creators could've done alot better."
1,warning Starforce,This game has a protection called starforce. Starforce can cause your computer to mess up and also. By the lawsuit that is hanging in cort right now damage to your computer system and cd/dvd drive.
4,The Gordon Gore,"This game really kept me going. Loved the outdoor graphics. Since I live in southern California, I especially liked the rain falling during the day. Some of this is very sad because of who dies. There was only one puzzle that I didn't really understand, so I went to a cheat.In this game we always see the protagonist, who sometimes shows a sense of humor in his antics. Lovely sites. Lots of cemetaries. Loved going to the pub.My main complaint is Chapter 6. Looking back, I question some of the logic of the game. All I can do is to chalk it up to the supernatural. The final catacombs was a lot of fun. I think I got killed about 5 times before I finally got it right. My favorite was falling down an abyss.The final scene of the game is my biggest gripe.However, for an engrossing, bloody, murderous, creepy game with lots and lots of things to do...then you will love it. You might even give it more than 3 stars. My highest grade would be 3.25."
4,Need to rely on the walkthrough too much.,"A fun game. More violent that I like, but I should have know with the M rating. This is my second Adventure Company game. I feel that one needs to check the walk through too often. There is no way for the game player to know what needs to be done without it. I can only compare it to the Nancy Drew games where you can use your head to keep the game going. Still fun to play, just be sure to print out the walk through and check it when you get stuck."
3,Entertaining,"I really liked this game. It took pleanty of time to play and the locations and graphics were good. The game got bogged down sometimes on how many times you had to go away and come back to the same person to move on, but all and all it was worth the time and effort. I hated the ending and really felt ripped off after investing alot of time into the main character I wanted some kind of redemption and continuation of the Gordon family line without the curse. I would have rated it higher if we found out why and how some of the people were killed and if the ending was better."
1,B O R I N G,This game is boring enough to fall asleep and never turn it back on. I found it very monotonous.
3,take your antidepressant,"Now, don't get me wrong, I liked this game because it gives you many hours of play, has pretty good graphics and terrific thunderstorms. However, it could use some comic relief.Everybody in the main character's family has been cursed for centuries and it is up to him to stop the curse. Insanity runs rampant in the family which leads to some gruesome events. The mood gets darker as the game progresses and the ending is, to say the least, depressing. I do recommend it, although you may want to wait for a lower price."
4,The Black Mirror....Good but lacked a little something,"Fans of the Gabriel Knight computer games will enjoy this game. I enjoyed it very much. Couldn't wait to get home to play this game on most days. Atmosphere was great. Loved the rain and thunder. Wished we could have seen more closely at the faces of people when talking to them. This is an awesome game! At a certain point in the game I did have an idea what was going on. Hence the 4 stars. Wished I could have gave it 5 stars. If there were a 4 1/2 stars, that's what I would have given this game. I wished the game could have went on a little bit longer. I also wished things could have been explained better at the end. That is all I will say. I don't want to spoil things for people. But the people who have finished the game will know what I'm talking about. But to sum it up... Great game, great characters, great graphics. A must play!"
2,Leaves you scratching your head,"This game was enjoyable up until the very end. The fact that it explained almost nothing leading up to the conclusion is irksome. The clues are blatant and I knew who the killer was halfway through the game. I think I would have enjoyed this game a lot more had it pieced the plot and subplots together. As it is, I ended the game with a lot more questions than answers and an unsatifactory feeling that I wasted my time. The ending was entirely too quick, and honestly I was expecting much more."
1,A COMPLETE LET DOWN,"After all the hype about how great the game was, the reality was such a disappointment. The graphics were fine, but the colors were very drab and not crisp enough to convey anything unique. The hardest thing was that I actually found myself bored halfway through the game....you have to waste your time going back and forth to places with no reason to be there just to get information to get further in the game. The characters were boring, there were tons of unuseable items that were a distraction. And after all the time you waste, the ending is the biggest let down. They should have just wrote on the final screen ""thanks for your money sucker"". Just like with movies that have really bad endings, I have even less appreciation and respect for games like this that stink due to the fact that you have to work harder to get to the end.Unless you have the time to waste on this sleeper, I would save your money."
2,Needlessly tedious,"I like games where you have to figure out puzzles, trade items for information other items, that sort of thing. I had high hopes for this because there were ""numerous characters"" to interact with and ""several locations"" to explore. Halfway through I got tired of the pointless dialogue, the need to travel back and forth between locations to get one item to advance the game. The ending was so anti-climactic I wondered if that was really supposed to be the end of the game. I expected there to at least be some degree of difficulty for the end. I wouldn't recommend buying this game."
2,"Okay, but scary to me......","The graphics, like everyone else has said, are gorgeous. The acting is terrible. The game definitely should keep its horror rating. It is gory. There's a ton of action that happens in a morgue! There's also a very scary scene in which you're talking to a man in a mental ward through a peep hole in an adjacent cell. But the worst part of this game, and the part that makes it able to keep the horror rating, is the satanic stuff at the end. Very creepy and very unnecessary. They could have ended the game without all of that. Not a game for children."
2,Some Puzzles Take Away the Fun,"I liked playing this game, until I got to some of the puzzles. I like puzzles in games, but some of the puzzles are a little too much for a couple reasons. First, the game designers assume you have certain knowledge or have books or an internet connection to look things up. I don't want to have to do research while I'm playing a game. Second, some of the puzzle start points are random so it is possible that you end up with one that isn't solvable and you have to restart from a save file. But it's hard to know if something is actually unsolvable or if you just haven't figured out how to solve it yet. It stalls the game completely and is really frustrating."
2,Payne,The games not bad but for Dreamcatcher the grapics are pretty lame. Doesn't capture me enough to play it often. Compared to all the other games I've played by Dreamcatcher/The Adventure Coit just can't stand up to them.
2,I found this game boring,"I waited so long for this game and was let down. You constantly have to go back and forth in the game for no reason, other than to waste time. The narrative is so lengthy I found myself skipping through it and the puzzles were not that challenging. I am looking forward to Cypher and hope it is not as disappointing."
2,Not worth the money ....,"I love adventure games ... but this one was stunningly boring. As another reviewer commented, even if you know what your next move should be, the game will require you to go away and come back. Some of the puzzles were annoyingly esoteric. For example, your knowledge of the signs of the Zodiac would be useful. Finally, the ending was a complete let down and didn't, on some levels, even make sense. The graphics were nice but I've seen at least this quality in more interesting games. The ""map"" was only marginally time saving. All in all, I can't recommend it."
3,"I just ordered this game a day ago, along with 'Scratches'...","I've been reading some reviews here to give me some thought of to how this game will be mostly. I have not received this game yet, but I'm due to receive it in a few days by mail. I can't wait to play this one, and 'Scratches'. I have played 'Myst' before, and I have 'Dracula:resurrecton, and the other Dracula game'. I mostly play Battlefield:2 online or IL2:Pacific Fighters or RainbowSix games, and games like FarCry, Deadly Dozen 1 & 2, theres some other games I have to aswell. Anyway, from what I'm reading in here, alot of people have mixed feelings about this game. I sure hope this game turns out to be fun and I'll be back to write another review."
1,Tedious and too wordy.,"I'll admit right now that I didn't finish this game and that is part of the reason I regard it so poorly. The truth is that I just wasn't interested in the characters or the story. Also I think that the game is poorly designed and one point there was no way to continue. I had to get save from further on from a cheat site. Gloomy sets, morbid characters, no jokes and no female under 60. No thanks."
1,Star Force Headache,"Windows 7 said this game was compatible, so I ordered it before ordering Dark Mirror 2 and Dark Mirror 3 versions. What no one said was that this game is protected by software called Star Force. In order to work, Star Force drivers must also be installed on your computer. However, Star Force is NOT compatible with Windows 7 and I wasn't able to find a patch that worked. Therefore, the game is useless to me on my desktop. Disappointing."
3,"Entertaining enough, but disappointing after all that work.","My daughter and I like to do these sorts of games together. We worked on it for a few days, and the game is lovely. Movement, music, interaction. But when we solved the last puzzle, questioned the last character and made it to the end, we were both sorely disappointed. What a lousy ending, in our opinion. So, in our estimation, this game is just okay."
2,played it like an interactive movie,"I really wanted to like Black Mirror...the gothic atmosphere was great and the story had the potential to be world-class scary. Unfortunately, the ""click on everything a few times and come back to it later"" setup was so annoying that I finally resorted to playing with a walkthrough so I could just enjoy some parts of the game without the frustration of counterintuitive actions--most of the puzzles weren't terribly difficult, but the walkthrough saved me from pixel hunting and multiple fruitless conversations.And yes, the ending is as bad as everyone else said it was."
4,another unjustly slagged adventure game,"Look-this is not the last express, blade runner or black dahlia ie a classic, but it is definitely 4 star stuff. It is a really long game (usually a negative for me) but it never dragged (like chtulhu did)and I always felt I wanted to go back and finish it (a good sign). As for the ending I do not understand the complaints I thought it was well designed and it definitely surprised me (no spoilers pls.). Graphics were exquisite for an older game. In short, this is worth your adventure gamer time. Cheerio."
4,I Did Love This Game..But...............,"I really liked this game, and the mystery behind it, but the only reason I gave it a four instead of a five, was the ending...I won't give it away, but I was disappointed!! Other than that, it was great!!!"
5,Good Clean Comedy,"Originally saw this movie many years ago, but I forgot the name of it. On the Amazon search I put in ""Audrey Hepburn art heist"" and was thrilled when the movie I was looking for came up. I ordered two of this movie, and as soon as it arrived my husband and I watched it. It is very funny, and has no filthy language, and is a good family movie to watch. The acting is great, the color and sound on the dvd is very good. I will be ordering more of this movie, since I feel it wil make a great gift for family and friends."
4,"Small, but sturdy","My son requested this for Christmas. I explained that it was only 3"" tall, but he still wanted it. And you know what? He loves it. It's study and solid and he seems to really enjoy it."
5,Easy to use and it is powerful!,it is convenient to have around. it kills a huge list of bugs. it is easy to use. i sprinkle it around my buildings and any place that the fire ants are trying to get to. it repels the insects and has a lingering effect on them. almost time to order another bag. great product. i protect my hands from contact with the granules and always wash hands thoroughly after each use.
1,bug-b-what,Killed more bugs stepping on them than this crap did. It's a waste of money. Use baking soda instead. Nothing killed like diazinon.
3,"did the job, for a while","It did the job for a month or so, but after that the fleas were back with a vengeance. We followed the directions, and maybe it wasn't the product, maybe the fleas are just REALLY bad in our area."
2,Didn't Perform as well as expected,"2012 was predicted to be especially bad for ticks and mosquitoes, so I purchased this to be proactive and spare my 4 dogs and little girl from a parasitic attack.While its hard to know exactly how many bugs it killed off, I ended up picking a few ticks off my legs a few weeks after spreading the pellets and my daughter gets eaten alive every time she is out in the backyard (despite citronella torches as well).The benefit did not outweigh the risk and detriment of laying down chemicals on my yard."
1,MURDERESS,Why would anyone want to look at this book now knowing that a murderess participated in it? She makes me sick. Talk about your classic sociopath! No thanks!
1,Don't let a murderer profit from sales of this book!,"Don King takes the most breathtaking pictures! Too bad his murderer of an ex-wife co-wrote this book with him, it just ruins the entire project. I hope everyone sees what insatiable greed does to to already warped minds! I hope nobody ever again falls prey to her manipulative ways, Don is lucky that he escaped with his life intact!"
4,Murderess in Paradise,"Don't miss out on a chance to delve a bit into the mysterious past life of noted murderess, photographer Liysa King Northon. Incarcerated for the brutal slaying of her third husband, pilot Chris Northon, Liysa King Northon led a nearly idyllic life before her greed and mental instability poisoned all around her. This work, surreal in beauty, is interesting now as a pathetic testament to one woman's vision, talent, and ultimately perverted sense of self."
4,Just one problem,I got this for one reason. To lurn how to play Voodoo Child just like Jimi did. One problem though. IT DOES NOT HAVE VOODOO CHILD!!! It loses one full star for that alone. How can you sell a guitar book on Jimi Hendrix and not have probably his best guitar peice. Other than that its a great product with some really good music slow down software that is extremely useful
5,"Action-packed, thought provoking writing, spectacular art!","This is the best Aliens and Predator novella I have seen. All the characters are given their piece, the Aliens aren't just big bugs, but characters, the Predator isn't just a hunter, she's a mother searching for her children. Both creatures are like looking at something majestic and ferocious. And the human story is wonderful as well, a woman who is not as she appears to be. The writing may be confusing to first time readers or those who skim through it, I advise to read every word, every line. Enjoy the wonderful art, from the action packed sequences, to the landscapes, to the pain on Caryn's face, the rage on the Predator's, and the open-mouthed hiss of the Alien Queen. Wonderful book!"
1,this book gave me diarrhea,i can't say any thing good about this book the story was crap the art was dull its not worthy of thease characters
3,Nice toy,This is a nice attempt at an 80s replica of tranformers toys. I believe it is a ship from the original cartoon.
3,"Great compilation, horrific production","Great compilation marred by horrible production. I got this for a buck at a library book sale in Maine, I'd say if you come across it in a similar situation, pick it up as filler until you can get a better sounding compilation."
1,Major disappointment,"This book was a major disappointment. I have enjoyed all of Krich's previous books, but this book was terrible. Overlong, obvious and at times downright BORING. It seemed like Krich never knew what story she was writing. Cutting 100 pages would only be a start to improving this book"
2,Interesting Science and Religion marred by Implausible Story,"In a mystery novel filled with implausible motives, I learned a lot about fertility and Juddaism. But the characters were paper thin, the dialogue dull, and the setting and atmosphere all but non-existent. I'd like killers with real emotion and real motives, but Krich stretches at every turn to make characters do things that are simply unrealistic. It would be a forgiveable sin if the story itself didn't bog down in minute details of file cross-referencing, endless phone calls to hash over every iota of the case, and so much interior monolgue that it puts the reader to sleep."
2,Promises much--delivers little,"A Californian infertility clinic is the inspired setting for this sixth mystery thriller by Rochelle Krich. The main plot--involving the switching of donor eggs, embezzlement, controversial medical experimentation and murder--promises much. However, far too much time is spent on the minutiae of infertility treatment procedures and, especially, on a subplot involving the main protagonist's doubts about her own religious beliefs (who cares?). Nor is there enough of that essential thriller ingredient: sex. By the middle of the story, only the most dedicated reader will care to continue reading. Sadly, a book which should have been 'unputdownable' is the opposite."
2,Disappointed,I thought these would be thicker since they are called a washcloth. All these are is a oversize baby wipe.
2,"Not a book, a long article","I was quite excited to find this book, as I have been to the bookstore described, not far from where I live, and because I have also worked in a bookstore and recovered from cancer. I was disappointed to discover that it is really more of a lightweight long article than a book, with lots of lists in lieu of real content and a slightly arch tone that I began to find irritating quickly. I didn't finish it. Borrow it from the library if you are looking for a very quick and mildly entertaining read, and are able to overlook the tone; otherwise don't waste your money."
5,Must Read - Inspires and Motivates,"Suzanne's book captures the essence of life - good and bad times are at the fabric of everyone's life. Learning to work through the bad and capturing the good, found in abundance at Edwards Books. The characters are real and inspiring - reminding all of us that ""I can do whatever I want"". Read this book for inspiration or motivation or just enjoy meeting Janet, Flora and the other cast of characters found at the local book store."
3,"A lot of hypocritical steam, but funny a little bit at a time","""Shelf Life"" has its moments. It's like a collection of somewhat dry, bordering on badly written, short stories that amuse you when you don't have anything better to read.The reason I think the author is a bit hypocritical is that she complains about people continually misspelling her name, etc., but when she talks about ""Tuesdays With Morrie"", she intentionally spells it ""Tuesdays with Morey"". Seriously? Why would you think someone would take you seriously when you can't get a basic title, with such a wide fan base and with a lot of good recognition, correct?"
1,Un bookish Un-fun book,"The book reads like a shallow, way too long magasine article.The shop seems to specialize in self help books, so there's hardly a literary feel to it. The style too is annoying.For example, she writes that ""her dad wasn't big on books"".I would have expected a slightly ""bigger"" vocabulary then that."
3,"Not bad, but not great","This book has some good growing tips for different cactus species. But the pictures are almost all of cactus flowers. I don't grow cacti just for the flowers. I want to see the whole plant in a home, garden, or natural setting. Also, the book only covers cacti but not succulents and other related species. To be fair, the title doesn't say ""succulents,"" only ""cactus."" But you can buy many similar books that also cover succulents."
4,Tim Armstrong,"There was only one song played on the radio from this CD, and the air time was short. Most of the songs are a funky ska-esqe tone, every one of them enjoyable."
4,Get this album. Ignore the silly critiques.,"I have to chuckle about some of these reviews. Especially the one that states ""I can even overlook that Tim is singing with a pop punk teenager..."" I'm so glad you can overlook that little fact, you must be so punk rock.I'm in my mid-30's, I've been listening to punk rock since I was 12 and I listened (and went to the shows)of both Op Ivy and Rancid since the early days. To the tossers who want to somehow question the ""punk"" of this, give it a rest. This is a return, and homage, to one of the roots of punk. If you don't like it that's okay, just don't put on your punk rock sheriff's badge and presume to decide what passes muster for punk."
1,Punk is dead,"I was so excited to see Tim Armstrong had a new CD out. I love Rancid. I bought Boxcar Racer and the Transplants because he was on them. But don't expect anything even close to any of that. It's a slow, boring mixture of reggae, steel drums, horns, and more reggae. I think 6 of the 10 songs start out exactly the same, the other 4 begin and you wonder if its going to be a Billy Joel song. His voice just isn't fitting to the music being played.He sings about Rock and Roll and Punk but never plays any.It makes you wonder is this really him and he's been fooling us for all those years? Poetry it is not."
2,A non groupie review...what a concept,"The first three songs on this album are really song. Great reggae and ska inspired tunes, reminiscent of Op IVY. I can even overlook that Tim is singing with a pop punk teenager on ""into action"" and enjoy the tune. What I can't over look is that the album really falls apart after the first three songs. The rest of the album sound like demos...or transplants outtakes. Pretty disappointing. I love ska, punk, and reggae, but these are dull tunes. The only song I can stand on the rest of the album is ""among the dead"" and that's because it hints at an OP Ivy reunion. I can only hope after hearing this record...."
3,Very very basic,"I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this. it was a complete waste of money as far as I'm concerned, only because it is EXTREMELY basic - think, Mary Had a Little Lamb level. Which of course is absolutely not a bad thing if you don't really play the piano but want to bang out a melody during the holidays. I also think that this would be a really fun book for little kids.On the other hand, I didn't see any indication on the book itself that this was so easy, and I guess I didn't see any reviews to that effect either. So I am still disappointed. I also purchased ""The big book of christmas songs"" by the same publisher, and that is much better. not complicated either, but a tiny bit more fun to play. if you don't play all the time, you'd probably need to practice a bit, but generally playing a chord inversion in the left hand and the melody (2 or 3 notes..sometimes 4 but never all the way through the song) in the right hand."
5,excellent!,"I'm also on a low carb diet, I've been buying these bars at the local ""Trader Joes"" store for the last 6 months. They are delicious! Great texture (not dry and chalky like some others), excellent taste, and they satisfy the snack craving! Met-RX products on the other hand, that's a whole different story...."
1,Also find it greatly over-rated,"Was glad to see someone else validate my feelings that the book is incredibly overated. Last night I also quit half way through, when I simply got tired of reading it. I found it a great jumble of plot and people - none of whom could I bring myself to care about."
4,A slow moving story that keeps you reading,"This novel meanders along with long descriptive passages and relatively little action. It is well written, the language carefully setting the stage physically and emotionally. However, it still is a book to keep you up late or forget dinner. The reader is drawn into the book and cares where it leads.The story itself develops almost as a character study - characters shaped by family, education, history, personal bent. The author has an excellent sense of what events will shape the character in the readers mind and what events will ultimately explain that character. She portrays characters and history as messy multi-value things that always slip away from rational explanation, i.e. she captures the world more as we experience it.Definately a good read."
2,Simply Over-rated,"Half way through this book and it still makes little sense. The whole of the Hamilton Case, for which the book is titled, takes about one chapter, the rest honestly- is pap. Sorry to say the reviews of others led to me read this and I'm sorry I did."
4,A rich text told in two different parts,"When I picked up this book, I was presented with a series of charming but not seemingly connected anecdotes about life in the island nation of Ceylon. They were interesting stories, but not a connected narrative, and I kept wondering when the mystery of the ""Hamilton Case"" was going to come up.It turns out that there is a lot of introductory anecdotal text before the reader is treated to the ""Hamilton Case."" I've read that some reviewers didn't get through the book, and I encourage everyone to stick around until they get to the mystery. The book takes off from there. This is an excellent piece of historical fiction and a rich literary tale."
1,disappointment!,"I sent this product back at the day i received it. Because, although it seems that they will send shirt and short together, they only sent shirt. And even i asked for a medium, it was like an xxxxl ... too big.. So i do not recommend this product at all!"
4,Very useful for many reasons,"I would reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in studying and improving their chess. It gives a wonderfully interesting history of the soviet masters, with plenty of illustrative games. Then it also opens your eyes to the way that the top soviets increased their strength. I personally got more from this book than I did from the Think Like a Grandmaster series. afterwards i took a new look at the board in familiar opennings and thought of new ideas, and when I later did alittle research on them, I found that they were used by many of the top grandmasters of the 60's but have since gone out of fashion. the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, is cause comrad Kotov's voice gets on my nerves a little too much. I little bit too pro communism for my taste."
1,Untrustworthy,"The foreword says it all. The book is a nod to the authorities, the history is school-boy. Little effort is made to justify content. Went straight in the bin."
2,Very low output,"I bought this amp on eBay for around $60. I had it bridged to a single 12"" in a sealed box 4Ohm. It 150w bridged @ 4 Ohms. I am upgrading already.That being said. It is a cheap 1st amp for a audio n00b. I bought it knowing it wasnt that great. I just had no idea why. After a year I fully understand why. I have pounded the hell out of it and it has not died. If you are thinking of this amp, email me, Ill sell you mine for 20! lol. no, seriously... I will."
5,Great sticks,They actually taught me how to play drums. They are magic. Buy all you can but go to a music store and try them first. You can't find your stick by gazing at it online or because so and so plays them.These were the first non Pro-Mark stick I've used and I'll buy more.
1,What happened??!!,"This has got to be the worst Jetfighter ever. I had more fun with the first Jetfighter game 15 years ago. You just play the same game over and over again. You don't get to land or takeoff, or even attempt carrier landings. What a complete waste of money."
4,great game for teens,"I bought this game for my son a while back and I am letting him write the reveiw,Let me start off by saying that the game is pretty realistic and has lots of different options. the Graphics are fantastic and the game has so many different ways of viewing the planes. The missions are fun and realistic with objectives like destroying MIGs and tanks, or figureing out the ID of a factory. This wasn't an instinct buy, a Vet. fighter pilot recomended it to me.Overall it is a very good game and I would Highly recomend this game.as far as i can tell, it has no drawbacks"
1,Can't even install,I couldn't even get the game to run. Everywhere I look I hear bad things about this game. A waste of $10.
4,"nicely presented, easy to read with a lot of fine explanatio","nicely presented, easy to read with a lot of fine explanations to understand really the use of the phrases. It is worthwhile if one is interested in patterns (which helps a lot)"
2,japanese phrases youll never use,"i dont see anything common about these phrases. there is a useful item for daily use here and there but for the most part heres what you get. ex-since this event unfortunately coincides with the arrival of the U.S. president, im affraid many of you may have been inconvinienced by security checks at train stations or on the streets. thank you for putting up with all the bother it has taken to be here. ive only lived in japan for 3 months but i highly doubt thats a common japanese phrase. i did however like the in depth descriptions of when to use the said phrase"
3,Good bang for the buck,"The shooting glasses will not fit over prescription lenses. The ear muff reduce noise quite a bit, but nowhere near the set at the range. They would be perfect for an outdoor range, where you would still like to be able to talk to one another."
1,Robbins should quit while he's ahead.,Absolutely no substance. Nothing at all like his first few books. The Carpetbagger was his last good one as far as I'm concerned. Don't waste your time.
1,a hollow going-nowhere loud-thunders-no-rain porn-movie like novel,"don't know what's the purpose of writing this porn movie-like novel. so many meaningless intercourse scenes that got absolutely nothing to do with the storyline. using wii background just to describe how a bunch of lowlifes ripping off uncle sam's jeeps and selling to the postwar european black market. you call this kind of people predators? the writing and storyline was typical h.robins style, but again, i have to ask his spirit (if it really exists): what's the purpose of writing this pointless novel?"
1,Save your money,"I made it through about three chapters of this book and just got tired of all the sex in the book. I don't mind a couple steamy scenes or whatever but this was so laden with sex scenes you couldn't concentrate on the story. Seemed like every dude had two or three girls going at a time and their wives never caught on. When they weren't having sex they talked about sex.The sex parts weren't even written well. They were stupid and didn't even fit the story.After reading part of this book I won't be wasting my time with this joker again. I might as well get a penthouse and a readers digest and read a paragraph from a readers digest, browse/read sixteen pages in the penthouse, another paragraph fron the digest .....Be more interesting and likely have a more fulfilling plot."
1,An Incredibly Disapointing Book From a Great Author!,"This was possibly one of the worst-written books I have ever read. I hate to not finish a book, and that is the only thing that kept me with this one. I have read some outstanding books from Mr. Robbins, and I highly doubt that he himself wrote this one. Never once did I feel that I connected with any of the characters; they weren't even very likable. The writing style is flat and unnatural, and the plot (or lack thereof) drags along with no apparent focus. I would definetly recommend any of Mr. Robbins's books before this one!"
1,Pure Trash,"I loved the Carpetbaggers and was astonished by this book. The storyline and characters are weak, it doesn't read well at all, and as far as I am concerned -- it is pure porn!"
1,Angry enough to write this review!,"A MASSIVE TRAVESTY! Bought the book on strength of author's name. If H.Robbins wrote this book (I doubt it) he was in a semi comatose state with a limited multiple choice plotline/dialogue clipboard. I enjoyed Stiletto,The Carpetbaggers & The Adventurers. I'm not a critical reader; merely looking for novelty and action. I believe book was published for minimal money return on strength of author's name; absolutely NO redeeming value. Book is excellent argument for creating a lower rating than one star!"
1,Gable attic fan,"This fan arrived in a box with no packaging to speak of and a few bits of broken plastic in the bottom. That's right, plastic... the whole frame is plastic. Looks like metal in the pictures, doesn't it? This ""heavy duty extra quiet"" fan is just about all plastic and was warped on arrival. I could only imagine it would warp more in a hot attic! I contacted the vendor who un-charged my card with no fuss but strangely, did not want the fan back, just wanted to claim shipping damage... Anyone want a warped cracked plastic attic fan cheap? I bought an all-metal Dayton from Grainger to install."
4,OPUS DEI IS UNMASKED,"WALSH HAS DONE HIS HOMEWORK! AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN POLITICS, CONSPIRACIES, OR RELIGIOUS ISSUES. WALSH IS ABLE TO GO DEEP INTO THIS WORLD OF OPUS DEI AND GIVE US A HISTORY OF THIS ORDER AND REASONS WHY IT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ORDERS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SINCE THE JESUITS. VERY INFORMATIVE AND BACKED BY OTHER BOOKS, NEWSPAPER ARTICLES, AND INTERVIEWS, AND PERSONAL TESTIMONY. WALSH REVEALS SECRETS OF THE ORDER, ESPECIALLY ITS ROLE IN POLITICS AROUND THE WORLD; THE READER WILL NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN. AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO BEGIN THE SEARCH FOR THE HIDDEN TRUTH OF OPUS DEI. THE BOOK IS MORE INFORMATIVE THAN BIAS AND CRITICAL, BUT MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT THE READER IS LEFT WANTING MORE!"
2,"Biased Portrayal, Showing Jesuit-Opus Rivalry","Walsh, a former Jesuit, bases many conclusions about Opus (admittedly) on the Prelate's constitution of 1950! He holds the Prelature hostage to practices based on their rule of half a century ago. What if someone's only view of America's south was a snapshot of 1954? While it may be true that Escriva was slow to embrace the liturgical changes of the Second Vatican Council, so were thousands of clerics ordained before 1969. Opus influence in anti-Marxist dictatorships is frequently cited, yet there exists no apology for Jesuits holding state positions in Ortega's Sandanista Cabinet! He concludes that Opus is ""less Christian"" than those who practice Liberation Theology. Ironically, it was a member of Walsh's former Order that was a US Congressman with a Pro-Abortion voting record."
1,Completely uninformed,There are times when one must not speak if one does not know the subject. I believe that this is one of those times. Walsh has no relative idea of the meaning behind the Opus Dei. His concepts and his rationale are very contradicting to the spirit of the Opus Dei. It is pertinent to respect others opinions - even those like Walsh's. But it is also pertinent to make it clear when someone attacks or criticizes something that they clearly do not understand. I would definetly NOT recommend this book. Try reading The Man from Villa Tevere or The Way or It is Christ Passing... those can give you a better idea of what the Opus Dei is about.
1,Balanced Opinion?,"Does this reader even understand Opus Dei?For starters, it is not a religious order--a mistake that would allude to his misunderstanding of the most basic aspects of Opus Dei. Opus Dei seeks to bring sanctity into the lives of ordinary people. That is why it wasn't formed as a religious order.The truth is mixed with the author's schemery to deface an institution of the Church.Those who read this book should be aware that the author will not give a balanced opinion. In fact, wouldn't this book be a better read if it inspires much hatred in its readers?"
1,02 mercury cougar SRA Intake,I was overall not very impressed with the AEM Short Ram Air Intake. First off let's start with the missing parts. I had to run to my local auto parts store the grab the right bolts to mount the MAF sensor. Then I ran into the problem of too small of a hose clamp for my one air line. As soon as I was all done with fixing all of AEM's problems...so I thought... I ran into a bigger problem. My hood would not shut. The mounting bracket was too long pushing the intake higher than the hood. So I had to rig up a way to hold it in place. Not to mention I got directions that was specific to my 02 mercury cougar and in those directions it never says nothing at all about buying your own bolts or hose clamps or modifying this product in any way. The only real plus to this outfit is that it looks nice in the engine bay and sounds a little meaner. I would not recommend this unless you want to engineer this to fit your car.
2,The book should be a pamphlet of 30 pages. A lot of double talk and details that NO ONE needs to know.,"It is like wading through a 5 foot pool filled with pudding. Slow prodding, boring, poorly written and not worth much. This guy tells everyone to go into debt to the eyeballs and invest. Poor advice to anyone."
1,Look out,"I read this book. Makes no sense in 2011, don't know if it ever did. Good way to lose a lot of money in the current situation. I'm also highly skeptical of whole life insurance being a good investment, certainly never has been before. Look out!"
4,Professional strength examples,"This is the more technical ""big brother"" to Missed Fortune 101. I would recommend Missed Fortune 101 for an introduction to the concepts and this book only to the financial professional or others who are interested in LOTS of financial details and examples."
3,Good read but be wary.,"Like many of the other reviews, I agree the concept is interesting and makes sense for very specific cases. I would be causious of thinking this is for everyone who owns a home.The concept in general is simple, which I like. If you can explain it to a 12 year old then I think you have a good grasp of the idea. Doug does a good job of breaking it down so that most of us can easily understand and probably explain it to a 12 year old. Applying it over the long term is something entirely different. In California most people do refinance or sell every 5 so years. This concept at least tells them to focus on saving rather than spending it, something that most Americans do not do well.I would recommend reading it and understanding it but talking to several advisors and other people who have experience with this before acting."
4,Get Your Fortune Back,"This is an excellent book with many examples of how changing your money management and especially you equity management strategy will result in greater wealth and safety in investing for you. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the author belabors several points and essentially is just repeating the same material over and over. Other than that, the ideas and strategies are well worth looking at and the authors heart is in the right place."
2,Some new ideas but very repetitive...ditto,"I got this book on the recommendation of a Financial Planner. The idea of not pouring your wealth into your house equity made a lot of sense. But it droned on for several chapters.Then when he got to the Insurance. It just did not add up. Some of the examples were confusing at best. Contrived at worst. Figure 18.3 on Page 350 just did not make any sense. I could never get my numbers to match his, which never breeds confidence.He had the results of a $6000 investment in a mutual fund after 1 year at a 10% yield equal to $6029. Even when I took into account some of his assumptions. (Sales charge of 5% and Management fees of .75) I could never get close to that number. And as I extrapolated this problem over 35 years, the difference became larger and larger."
3,Some new ideas but very repetitive,"Good thing the book was over 500 pages because many of the ideas were reiterated over and over. There really were 2 main ideas: #1. Keep your home mortgaged for as much as possible and utilize your equity in a side fund that will earn more than your mortgage interest, and #2. Use a complicated life insurance policy/strategy with that money to make far more than you could with an IRA or 401K. At the end of it all, I might agree with some of the reasons for keeping your equity out of your home and in a separate side fund, but the life insurance information was a little too complicated and relied on too many variables for me to trust (and you'd better have a lot of money to begin with for these strategies to work). An interesting read and I couldn't begin to explain how the strategies work in this short review but I wish I had checked the book out at a library. Worth the read if you want to hear about an investing philosophy that isn't mainstream."
5,Missed Fortune: Dispel the Money Myth-Conceptions,I wish I had read a book like this years ago. This book change the way I think about money. I can't thank Douglas Andrew enough for sharing his insights. A must read for anyone with a mortgage!!!!
4,Time to take note,This book has been out for a while now and I read it some time ago and it's a bookthat will bring you back to reality.I think that it's a must read as the facts and realities are very real and the author has some vital info for us all.There are benefits to be had if we pay close attention and it can be the key to managing your money in a better way.
5,Outstanding material on trading energy futures and options,"Thanks to the authors for presenting this information in language that is understandable to the masses. You have demystified a topic that is often encrypted.Many people in the energy business would benefit greatly in their overall understanding by reading this book! It is well-organized and makes the complex business of hedging futures contracts seem logical.I have worked with wholesale energy traders and seen the trading floor with it's live weather maps, analytical systems, and 100 or so traders and I thought it was an exciting environment. Understanding P/(L) positions, mark to market, and familiarizing with the multitude of hedging strategies has made this intriguing business all the more interesting to me.The book delivers exactly what its title implies. Thank you, again!"
1,Save Your Money!,"I thought this book would cover trading strategies unique to the energy futures markets. NOT!! It is a book filled with a lot of option strategies and technical analysis that could apply to any publicly traded equity. It contains nothing unique to futures or energy futures for that matter. Anything unique about the energy markets referred to in this book could be condensed in two or three pages. When the seller only lets you see the front cover, -- buyer beware. Save your money."
1,Unknown energy names write basic material,"The authors are two unknowns in the energy trading field. The book covers basics of futures trading. Nothing specific of energy and energy trading. Energy futures trading is a complex and useful topic, this is not the book that explains any in depth concept."
2,Not what I expected,Wasn't what I expected. Most of the book repeats the same material most of the other options books have. The book is very basic.
2,heavy socks that stretched out,"I would't recommend buying these socks.. they're a bit heavy and although durable, they stretched out to where now i'm constantly pulling them up over the course of playing.. i'd go for a lighter weight sock that retained it's shape a bit better.."
5,AMAZING,"All the Carbona Stain Devils are phenomenal. Pick the right formula and your stain will be gone. I use this one (fat and grease) all the time -- my hubby isn't very careful when cooking and his shirts are often splattered with grease, which I don't usually discover until after the first wash. Carbona removes the spots even after a wash and trip through the dryer. LOVE these products!"
3,So-so,"Wasn't terribly impressed with this stain remover. I have used this brand on other stains with success, but the fat, oil, and grease version came out lacking in effectiveness."
5,Miracle worker!!!,"On my flight home from Sonoma County, I rolled two bottles of red wine (cabernets) into my clothes and placed them inside a wine box. Then I packed the rest of my stuff around it. Due to baggage handling, the bottles broke and EVERYTHING was soaked and stained purple. I was devastated! Thinking I could savage the dark clothes, I rushed to the store and bought every stain remover in sight. This was the ONLY product that worked!! It even COMPLETELY removed the wine from the linen, white dress the bottle was rolled in (in hind sight, I probably should've used a black dress)!! AMAZING!!! I managed to remove EVERY STAIN! WOW!!!!"
1,It didn't work for me :(,"I was desperate to find something that would take out oil/petroleum stains. I found Carbona Stain Devil #5 here on Amazon. I didn't have much to lose, so I ordered it. After using, there was no change in the shirt stain. (Perhaps I didn't use it right? I don't know.) Luckily, I did try a combination of Spray & Wash and High-Concentrated All. This combination happened to work, before my g/f found out what I did to the new shirt she got me."
4,this sweeper is a must,This sweeper works great in the restaurant. It works great for food and other things.
2,Not worth it.,"While it does pick up some stuff off bare floors, it also leaves much behind, as proven by a light sweeping over the same area. Being made of plastic that easily gets a static charge, a lot of the fines particles and dust clings to the inside of the thing. Should have been made of a metal stamping, but I suppose that would have cost a dollar more."
3,"Nice color, but a problem pen","Received this item as a gift from my wife. I collect nice pens. Color was great and a perfect addition to my collection. Waterman is know for quality. However the cap does not secure itself tighly when in use, so it occassionally falls off. I will write the manufatuerer to determine if there is a solution."
2,What is it supposed to do?,"It is a very runny texture, which makes it not easy to use. I also didn't feel like it did what the product claims to do. Used it a couple times and never tried it again."
2,Just couldn't get into it.,I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it is me. But it was boring. Maybe someone else will love it.
2,Interesting For Scout Historians,"Lord Baden-Powell talks about his life as a spy and gives insight into some of his foundational ideas for the Scouting Movement. However it reads like a Sunday sermon in an old-folks home, interesting but dry."
1,Not worth the $$,"Casting marks (not a big deal), but the handle (and the hammer adapter) screw in at angles instead of straight in, they're hard to thread, and hard to start threading. The adapter also did not fit correctly in the air hammer.Very crappy tool set. Didn't bother to see if they worked our not, they went back. The angular misalignment of the handle to the work head would have made it impossible to hit or use them straight on."
1,Tool is low quality casting,The forks are made of pot metal. The large fork broke on second use. This product is a waist of money.
4,Tie rod kit,Must have if your are a jeep guy sooner or late you are going to need this kit to get those stubborn little bastards out. Show promise for long term durability. i have have only used them a few time but i could not complain about there performance.
3,Disappointing durability,"This toy is really cute, colorful and fun. I love the retro look of the spaceship. Unfortunately, it is not very durable. I bought this for my son and thought he would love it. When it first came, I was still impressed, but he didn't get a big kick out of it.The joints are too thin and breakable. The spaceship is metal on the body so the monkeys stick to it however you want them to, but the plastic parts on the spaceship have broken off. Some of the magnets don't work anymore either.I would not recommend this toy."
3,"Fun and cute, but not very durable","I have these as another desk toy, but after a while, I was forced to move them up to a shelf where they can't be touched. They are adorable, and both myself and others who visited my office frequently liked to pose them. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before the heads were loose, and the arms were getting weak to the point of breaking at the joints. I switched to Acrobots because they're a little bit more durable, while not necessarily as adorable. All in all, a very cute product, but beware of too much posing!"
3,Sigh...,"The monkeys bend. The rocket opens. But nobody plays with this thing. Even the dog won't chew it. It's good toy-box-filler, but that's where it stays..."
3,Good plot - painfully written,"My major reaction to reading this book was a burning desire to go back and rewrite it. The writer has a lot of imagination, interesting characters, and a good plot. Unfortunately she simply doesn't write very well. Problems with character viewpoint, problems with explication, slow writing - nothing truly awful, but if bad writing bothers you, you'll find it hard to get past it to the story. I certainly did."
1,The Sacred Stones Trilogy....Booooring!,The reviewers before me must have a high threshhold of pain. The first book in this Bronze Age fantasy squeaks by.. slow but mildly entertaining as we learn about Karne and his sister Kyra. The power of the Stones (like stonehenge) and priests is very mysterious. Book one ends with a thud and book two was so boring I had to fight to finish it. I only made it halfway through book three. There is a reason it's difficult to find these books at your local bookshop.... they stink.
3,YP-Z5QS 2 GB,"I do like little MP3, but I find a big dissadvantage the fact, that every time I have to charge it, I have to have PC with me. The MP3 comes only with USB cable! No additional charger available. For example, going on vacation - does that mean take the PC with me? Not a 21st century..."
4,Great Mp3 Player.......so far..,"I got this Samsung for almost 2 weeks,plays all my files without problems,I didn't install the software so i just made the ""Copy and paste"" with all the tracks..Easyyyy!!!..No complicated like the Ipods...the battery last for almost 30 hours (if you dont touch any buttom)..the sound is great, even with the original earphones (I tried a new JVC earphones, good bass and crisp sound..only $12 at Walmart)...the look is fantastic...the only thing I dont like,there is no ""custom equalizer""....the screen is clear and vivid colors,good size....My 2 Sansas only lasted for 48 hours, and the 1GB Creative was to small for all my music but still great sound after a few drops....There is no FM radio but nothing is perfect...this is the best you can get for the money..go for it!!!.."
5,Best Cookbook I've Ever Owned,"if I could have only one cookbook - this would be it, honest! Mine went missing about 10 yrs ago when we moved and I have really missed it. Nothing 'gourmet' here - this is simple, everyday food that you would find in any Polish kitchen ... it is the original 'comfort food' - Pierogis (several filling recipes), Kolacky, Makowiec (poppy seed jelly roll), Bigos, Babkas ... Beggar's cake - I had never seen a recipe for one before! And it has one entire section dedicated to nothing but mushrooms - they are <em>that</em> important to Polish cuisine. A ""Must Have"" for any kitchen, Polish or not!"
2,Not worth the money,"I looked at the ""Your Baby Can Read"" program and most people recommended the MonkiSee DVD's . They do not hold my two year old grandson's attention for five minutes."
2,Listen and Learn Russian,Very difficult for the absolute beginner. The audio cassette does not offer enough repetition for practice nor time to absorb the pronunciation. There is a helpful pronunciation and reading guide in the front of the book.
2,"Good design, flawed recording","The CD edition is a well-designed survival course in Russian for travellers. One speaker says a phrase in English and a native Russian speaker says the phrase corresponding to this in Russian with a pause for repetition. It uses the standard one repetition format and provides an excellent choice of vocabulary and phrases, many of which you don't get in other such courses. What I found disappointing, however, was that the quality of the recording was so poor that it was very difficult to pick out what the speakers were saying. I found it was like listening to an old-fashioned short wave broadcast with lots of distortion. The distortion is bad enough to make the CD's unusable for picking up pronunciation details. It's too bad --- it would have been a useful product otherwise."
1,no manual,"this order was a ripoff, no manual was provided with the discs which means it won't be effective and the discs will not be useful"
1,50s Russian,"To start with, this is not a course for beginners. The phrases are too long and too difficult.Second thing, which is much more important, nobody speaks Russian like that anymore. I'm a native Russian speaker and this is the Russian of the 50s. The course was created in 1956 or 1958 and reviewed in 1980s. The review didn't do much, if anything.Unless you study history of Russian as a linguist, I do not recommend this book."
2,Poor Quality for the Price.,"This is a flimsy, cheaply made, sweeper that quite honestly should cost about $19.95. I suppose you're paying for the Oreck name. It doesn't perform well on tile flooring but does a good job on carpeting. It picks up dog hair really well on carpeting. Bottom line: It's grossly overpriced and I'm sure you could find something that works just as well for a lot less money."
2,pusher not sweeper,"This product does a great job of pushing things from one area to another, not so great a picking them up. Does not work well on tile or hard wood."
3,I returned this product.,My review on this is neutral. I wanted a motorized sweeper. My mistake thinking this one was battery powered. Sent it back.
2,Orek floor sweeper,It doesn't pisk up dirt and crumbs that well I found myself going over and over the same area to get it clean. I could have pulled the vacuum cleaner out faster.This is my second disappointment with an orek product.
1,Had to return,"I purchased this because we saw a waitress using one in a restaurant and she said it worked great. We were so disappointed because we've had other Oreck products that are great. This would not pick up any cat or dog hair or lint on my rugs. Sorry, I had to send it back."
1,Small and does not work well,"This sweeper does not pick up dirt on a carpet well, rather it seems to push it so you have a pile of dirt that you then need to sweep up manually. Also, the 9.5 inch model is very small for trying to sweep any normal carpet."
2,Not good for pet hair,"On laminate flooring this sweeper actually did a good job. It would get crumbs, dust and loose bits of dog hair. It would not get the ""fur bunnies""/clumps that tend to accumulate though. It would indeed be good for restaurants with low pile carpet and hard surfaces with mostly crumbs to pick up.It was an utter fail on normal carpeting. The four corner brushes did lift the pet hair up but then just deposited it in clumps elsewhere on the carpet. That was pretty much what I bought it for (silent ""vacuuming while babies nap"" so it had to go back. I liked using it on the laminate but I already have a silent ""machine"" for them - a broom."
3,Not as good as what I would expect fro Oreck,"Ordered this for a store - berber carpet style flooring. Does ok picking up very light things, but hard to push and could be wider. I would not recommend this for any type of commercial or every day use."
3,It Could Be Better,"OK, so I read a lot of the reviews on this and many of them said that the handle falls apart when you use it. TOTALLY TRUE. The handle is basically 4 different pieces that you assemble together. Since I don't need to ever take it apart for storage, I used Liquid Nails to cement all the segments together. Now, there's no problem. As for how it works..... I use it on completely FLAT indoor/outdoor carpeting in my screen porch and it works good going forward, but sometimes when I go backwards with it, the stuff I'm trying to pick up comes back out. I got this one because it used these sort of windshield wiper blades underneath instead of a roller brush, so it's great picking up wet stuff in the screen porch and super easy to clean out. Overall, it works for the screen porch, but only because the carpet is completely flat like a hardwood floor."
1,Unhappy,I do not like this product. It does not pick up dirt and particles as it should and I would like to return it ASAP. How do I do that?
1,Didn't do the job,"This sweeper just moves dirt & dust around, doesn't sweep it up off the floor whether its carpeted or flooring. The sweeper doesn't do what is advertised. For example a sliver [1/2 inch x 1 inch] of paper on the bare & non-shag carpet floors, the sweeper moved it around but didn't sweep it up into the bin on the sweeper. Same thing happened with dust balls on the floors.I'm very disappointed."
3,works well,"This product works well on carpets and floors. The only reason I give it 3 stars is that the handle is a little flimsy and feels very flexible. Amazon delivered this quickly, actually quicker than they predicted."
2,Ortho Rose Pride,I did not find the product effective in preventing yellow and spotted leaves on my rose bushes. I will not use it again.
5,An Effective Insecticide,"I use this product as part of an effective IPM program in our gardens for roses. It comes as a concentrate and must be diluted according to instructions. It is very good against aphids and mites.Dr. Brian KlingeSanta Barbara, Calif."
4,Great for Rose Bushes,This is a great product for your roses. Keeps them disease free. Which here on the Gulf Coast isn't easy. Its unfortunate that this leaked out of the bottles before it arrived here. Hopefully I will get more soon .
1,"Buy it from Home Depot, its less hassle","I reported the no-show of this product. My rose dust did not appear. But, Home and Lawn told me I needed to ask all my neighbors and friends and my neighborhood priest to see if they had seen the product in their yards and porches. I did that. Zip. Then I was told by Life and home to check with the carrier (FEDEX). I did. Zip. Finally after no resolution from Life and Home they will send out a route tracer. OK, Meanwhile I have been waiting since the 3rd of December 2012 for the rose dust. A lot of hassle for a $ 14.00 dollar plastic container of rose dust. Meanwhile, my roses were getting very sick with rose must and black spots. I had to go to Home Depot. Don't buy anything from this outfit. Buy it at Home Depot instead. You will have fewer problems. Colonel Boyer, U.S. Marines"
3,Original and very funny,"I really enjoyed this, it was recommended to me a few years back and I have since recommended to others. everyone has enjoyed it. But I've never met anyone who has heard of it independently. It's one of the few books that has made me laugh out loud. I hope her new book is as good. duncanreallyismyname@yahoo.com"
5,guilty pleasure...,"I felt guilty and twisted for being so wrapped up in Nude Men. I found it at a thrift shop and picked it up solely based on the cover, and the name of course! And then to hear it's out of print... what a lucky find! The story is engulfing, the characters come to life with Amanda Filipacchi's comfortable writing style and there wasn't a single page that didn't make my jaw drop in complete disbelief. Throughout the book I was morbidly intrigued by the plot... as said before: Disturbing. Not a book for everyone, but I totally enjoyed it! I look forward to checking out other works by Filipacchi."
1,Not fit to lick Aimee Bender's boots,"What a disappointment. This derivative novel is relentlessly tedious and unfunny. The passage describing the dancing magician's clumsy and talentless performance is a perfect metaphor for Filipacchi's writing. If you're interested in surreal meta-fiction, skip this pale imitation of the real thing and check out Robert Coover, Donald Barthelme, Paul Auster, Angela Carter, Kevin Brockmeier, George Saunders and the brilliant, courageous Aimee Bender."
4,"Off-beat look at men, nymphets, cats and artists",I couldn't read this book at work because I was laughing so hard I disturbed coworkers. Jerry A. finds that its very disturbing to have a horny young girl lusting after him. He also has a strange cat. As the book progresses it make unusual turns- and goes from very funny to very serious. A first novel worth trying.
1,Waste of a precious Saturday. Completely Pointless.,"I spent the better part of my day reading this book and now wish I had chosen something else to read. It is so strange that at first it draws you in and then it quickly becomes one of those books that you keep reading because you know there just has to be a point...some deeper meaning...there isn't. This book is senseless, and often disturbing. Every character in the book is deeply disturbed, and the plot is pointless and often upsetting. I love to read and I feel this book stole a day that could have been spent with a book worth reading, because this one definitely is not."
1,Infantile and inept writing,"I heartily agree in every detail with the reader from Canada who reviewed this book on February 13, 1999. Nude Men suffers an abundance of the kind of elementary errors at developing skill at writing fiction that one commonly sees in creative writing classes for the rankest beginners. And no, I do not find the gaucheness either surreal or a form of irony. I find it merely ludicrously amateurish, and it is baffling how such a book ever came to be published."
5,Thanks for a great flight!,"I picked up this mystery right before my cross country flight - It was so much fun to read, I totally neglected the DVD player I'd brought along for the trip.Shelton had my attention from the first chapter and held on to it. This was the first of the Charlie Parker series I've read, and I had no trouble getting to know the characters - I really loved ""meeting"" Charlie."
5,Sharp,I love this watch. It's classic and sharp. It's large enough to stand out but not obnoxiously big like some watches these days. The titanium is light enough that I can wear it on a jog or a bike ride but it looks very solid.
5,Jaime,"this watch is incredible! I have it for almost two years, wore it in the beach, pools, bicycling and it held well until the moment, got a few knocks on it and dropped it a few times (i am a very clumsy person) and you can't even noticed the scratches, I have a tag heuer aquaracer 300 m and let me tell you the quality of the the Swiss army compared with tag regarding the craftsmanship its very similar and this cost a third of the tag, i don't know about the movement but it's very accurate, need it to recalibrate when it came tough but minor stuff, you can do it on your own, just find the video in youtube, resuming if you have expensive watches and want a good watch for everyday use without breaking the bank this is it, if you want a nice watch to wear it everyday any time this is it, my only regret is that doesn't have a screw down crown in that one the tissot PRC200 beat it!"
5,"Beautiful, light watch and an eye grabber!",This is my fourth Victorinox watch in my growing collection of time peices. This particular watch is so light I hardly know it's on my wrist! The watch band is more silver in color than some of the pictures displayed for this watch but it is by no means ugly. The hour and minute hands are very bright and glow nicley in the dark. I love my latest purchase from Watch Grabber and look forward to my next time piece for my collection.
1,unwatchable garbage,"don't let the cover or text sway you into thinking this is a neat monster/horror film. its not. its a very low budget attempt at horror directed by someone with no imagination on how to stretch the budget for max effect. most of the film takes places in the inside of what we're led to believe is a rig, but looks more like a high school attempt at creating a haunted house. the few outside scenes are purposely poorly lit and funkily shot to camouflage another pitiful attempt at creating a realistic set. the story, however, is the worst part. its generally non-existent, and a completely random excursion through meaningless dribble. and there's a few actors you'll recognize, but it'l take a while because you haven't seen any of them for 10+ years...for a reason. very disappointed."
1,Don't waste your time...,"save your money. The only known actor in this movie, William Forsythe is only in it for fifteen minutes. He is the first one killed off.Most of the ""monster"" scenes are dark and hard to see. After I watched it, I tossed it in the trash..."
1,THIS SUCKS BUT THE COVER LOOKS KOOL!,THIS MOVIE SUCKS THE COVER WILL FOOL AND THE ONLY THING KOOL ABOUT THIS MOVIEWAS THE COVER ART OTHER THEN THAT NOT WORTH WATCHING.
1,Don't look at the cover..it's a bad..bad movie,"It's a real cheap movie, with bad actors set. The ''Weyland'' Rig corp..or whatever it's called was simply ripped off AvP movies. Almost exact name of organisation, almost identical emblem. Why everyone thinks that if they rip something off aliens, they will get a lot of money and lots of views? This movie is garbage. Don't let the cover fool you."
2,Nice try ... Maybe Next Time,"I'll give the actors, writers and director credit for trying ... unlike some of the bad sci-fi horror films where no effort seems apparent."
3,RIGOR MORTS,"THE RIG is not a horrible movie but it's not destined to be a classic either. Set on an oil rig during a rather mild hurricane, the movie has its reasonable amount of thrills but suffers from too much filler, mediocre acting and not enough views of the creature. The direction is rather lackluster as well.I enjoyed it in spite of these faults--you could do worse."
1,"Bad lighting, dulled color, and bad script","The Rig is a really dull horror movie. The photography sucks. The color has been dulled down or tinted greenish. The lighting often fails to illuminate the actors' faces. Mediocre photograpy kills this movie. The script isn't very good either. I know this is a low budget movie, but that doesn't excuse it from letting us see the monster. Editing and bad lighting keep us from getting a very good look at the monster(s). Even if you like some of the low budget syfy movies, I would advise you not to buy or rent this stinker!"
5,Golden loves them!,"My Golden can get picky and eating is not a priority for him. I was worried during training he was going to be too anxious to not eat any training treats. Well...these he will eat and I am very great-full! However, they do not have the best smell (definitely not something I would eat). :) Will be purchasing more."
5,Corgi Cocaine,We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet. This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time). We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people! These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!
5,Dogs favorite treat,We have a variety of treats for our two shitzus. Their favorite are the freeze-dried livers. Nice big container that always has the dogs running when they hear me opening the lid. Bought two of these.
1,Review of Freeze Dried Liver Treats For Dogs,I received all containers previously opened - all seals were opened. On the top of containers was decent pieces of liver and below that were grisley pieces and a lot of powder on the bottom. I will never buy liver treats from Amazon again. BIG RIP-OFF!
3,Not satisfactory,I bought 21 0z freeze dried liver. Half the container was filled with powder instead of pieces/chunks. I feel I was betrayed by the company. Hence I did not get what I paid for
1,Why sbould I get crums?,"I selected this company over the other even though the price was higher. I was hoping the pieces would be more consistent in size. It tuened out the container was filled with smaller crum like pieces, worse than the other company's. I will never buy anything from this company."
2,"great treat, but too expensive","okay, it's freeze-dried liver cube-lets. my common sense tells me that for a lot less than the price of this treat i could buy real liver, cube it and freeze it. it would serve the same purpose for a lot less money, and it would not be over-processed.that said, our dog would do back flips for this treat, so if you're made of money, go ahead. you'll make your dog's day :-)"
4,Woof woof!!,"My three month old Westie loves this treat. The only bad thing is that it's huge for training. If I command sit, it takes him 20 seconds to finish eating it and do the next trick. I recommend breaking it into tiny pieces because the label says 1 or 2 a day only. My pup loves this treat and would do anything for it!"
4,Can't resist this !,My dog can't resist these treats - I can get her to do anything if I have one of these with me!
5,Great training treat,"I use these as training treats with a squeeky ball in an Evolv Roundtangular Chalkbag for training and everyday positive reinforcement of good behavior. Also, the liver is a great source of vitamin A which our one dog is deficient in and develops lumps in his ears. These treats in combination with a couple of scoops of Nummy Tum Tum Pure Sweet Potato for Pets each meal keeps the lumps away. I get both through Subscribe and Save."
3,Cat likes these --- but verdict is stil out,I know these are supposed to for dogs but I saw that cats like them too. Mine did but one day he just nuzzeled one and didn't eat it. It sat there in his bowl for three days before I threw it out. He likes them fresh from the box and if they are not eaten he won't touch it the next day. Its not like it gets stale i would thnk. They are a bit chunky for them and they need to chew into smaller pieces before swallowing. they are hard to break into smaller bits. They have a bit of a foul smell too --- not like a salmon smelll which I'm fine with. This is more like a dry bloody odor that isn't too much fun to work with .
4,Best snack item for my dog.,"Otter and I are very happy with this product. I am happy to have come across this dealer on line, because it was the best deal with respect to cost and convenience."
5,Amazing Training Treat!!,I have tried several different kinds of training treats from pet stores and they all either made my English Bulldog puppy sick or lose interest. The liver is working great she absolutely loves them and they keep her attention 100%!
5,Chihuahuas Favorite,"Great Product, these are my Chihuahuas favorite treat. I have never had any problems with them except the bucket runs out to fast."
4,Check what you are buying this for. This is not a gender changer,"I bought this knowing very well that this is not a gender changer. I am currently using it as a port riser to raise the vga port on the back of a motherboard above a certain height. Otherwise, a vga cable plugged directly into the port will obstruct an adjacent USB port, rendering that USB port inaccessible. (Poor design on the part of the motherboard manufacturer). For this purpose, this vga adaptor (or should I say, riser) fulfills its purpose. The additional 0.5"" height it provides steers clear of the USB port. If your intention is to connect two vga cables together, you probably would need a female - female gender changer instead."
3,"Nice, but...","This CD had some great tunes from the movie, but I think they would have been better off including it with other music that was in the movie as well. At only 31 minutes long (less than a typical jazz CD of that era, there is much disc space left for additional music, especially after spending $30.00 for the CD!"
4,"All, basics or deficient compromise","PC Study Bible produces a really good product that I have been using for some years. The latest version 5 has updated references and research information and searches have improved even more from PCB4. Understandably, like most software, this does cost particularly if one is looking for complete reference works and different bible versions. This version of PCB 5 provides a nice mix of references and Bible versions though not all that may be on a wish list. I do take issue with not being able to mix and match what I really would like in the options. In some cases like this one, one option I really wanted was two tiers (libraries) up which meant spending more on stuff that I did not need to get what I wanted which can get get frustrating. It's either all, the basic or the deficient compromise that I took which is the reason for 4 stars."
3,Not Exactly Dissappointing,"I must say that I love the concept of a world plunging into darkness and chaos resulting. I also admire the way Asimov and Silverberg manage to explain why everything happens using theoretical science. I also like the way that an astronomer, a psycologist, an archaeologist and a reporter could be linked together amidst a catastrophe. Nevertheless I do not like many things about the book. Mainly, I don't like the ending. As was mentioned in another review, I think that it was too rushed. I don't like the way all the characters turn out to be good and everyone is happy. While this ending is satisfying since you find out what happens to everyone, I find it utterly dull and repetative. I don't like the way the book ties up all loose ends and leaves you nothing to think about. There are no themes to ponder and the characters are not described well enough for you to feel for them. I feel that this book had a great plot, but the story probably could have been better written."
4,"Great, but better ending needed","This is a pretty good book, everything works, except the ending. What happened with that? Suddenly it is all over and you have no idea what is going to happen. Probably best to be left as a short story, but it is still very good."
4,A fine classic co-authored by the master.,"The short story this book was based upon was ""better,"" inthat it was told bluntly and to the point, with little ifany regression. The expanded book form was entertaining,and I highly recomend it--- and yet I found that some ofthe parts didn't really ""need"" to be in the book. If oneis looking for Asimov at his best, one could do betterlooking elsewhere. Still, it is very much worth reading.Mister Asimov did better work writing alone."
3,"half good, half bad","This book is worth reading--for the ideas and themes if not for the story. I've read other Asimov works (The Foundation Trilogy is one of my favorite series of all time), but this one seemed stretched thin, possibly because it was co-authored.The first third of this book, up until Nightfall, is chilling and thrilling. The second half wanders, and though I don't want to give anything away, has a very anticlimactic ending. After finishing it, I felt the last section 'Daybreak"" could have been left off almost completely and the novel would have actually benefitted.Some of the ideas in the novel should have been further developed, while others, especially a quasi-romance subplot, made the story drag in places.To sum things up, the first half or so is excellent, true to Asimov-form. The second half is boring, disappointing, and un-Asimov. For a 5 star start and a 1 star finish, I give 3 stars. I would be interested to know who wrote which parts of this book."
2,Great Premise but the ending falls short,"The 300 pages of this novel are fantastic. The authors started with a brilliant idea - what would happen to a world that never saw night if the sun should set?In the world of this novel, the world orbits six suns (luckily you never have to examine the astronomy of this, it would be ludicrous) which means a sun always shines in the sky. Because of this, the inhabitants of the world have a great fear of darkness - an amusement park ride consisting of nothing more than a boatride in darkness causes some of its riders to go insane.When a group of scientists piece some clues together, showing that there will be a period of darkness, an eclipse on a day when only one sun crosses the sky, they try to warn society. But they fail and the world begins falling apart - so does the novel.The tightly bound writing collapses. A brilliant beginning is followed by such a sub par ending that I cannot recommend this novel higher than two stars."
2,"Heavy on light, light on plausibility","Because I enjoyed the Foundation series, I wanted to enjoy this book, but from the start I kept asking myself a question: Why the hell don't the people simply stay indoors with lights on, FOR JUST ONE NIGHT? (They had various light sources.) This literary device is called an idiot plot, where nobody states the obvious solution while the reader screams it. Other than that, it seemed a predictable potboiler filled with basic science lectures. Silverberg wrote the ending--I read the short story, too--and I must assume he was running out of typewriter ribbon, because the story ends as abruptly as it does unsatisfactorily. Disappointed."
2,I was expecting for more...,"Having never read anything by Silverberg, but being an avid Asimov readoer, I picked this one up. The first part of the book is well handled and very interesting. It truly expands the original short story. I thought to myselg ""this will earn 4 stars at least.""Then the second part, Daybreak, came along... and my rating fell from 4 stars to 2.Characters became flat, the story became boring and cliched and it has one of the worst endings I've ever read, so hurried up, to wrap things up fast.Looking for great Asimov sci-fi? Try the original ""Nightfall"". Try the Robot Novels and the Foundation series. Try The End of Eternity. They WON'T dissapoint you. This one, on the other hand, will."
2,Where can I find the original short story?,"I agree that the original ""Nightfall"" short story is one of the very best from the Golden Age of Science Fiction in the 1940s, and I see no need for it to have been expanded into book length.But where can I find the original still in print?A note on one of the earlier reviews of this book: I'm sure the 16th-century astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler was meant, not the 20th-century novelist Arthur Koestler."
2,Here's a Book That'll Make you Turn Out the Light...,"...and go to sleep. Is it just me, or are the main characters in this book unsympathetic? The only one I can think of that was even slightly likeable was Sheerin, and yet he's scarcely there past the introductory chapter. I really wish I could have just read the short story, and done without several hundred pages of tedious ""before and after"" fluff."
3,"An Adolescent, Shallow Version of Y2K","The premise of this novel is that the world of Kalgash has six suns, and so the people have never known darkness (evidently they don't have basements). When a rare astronomical arrangement causes total darkness for a few moments, the entire population of the planet goes stark raving mad with fear, and destroys civilization. (Though they are blubbering insane, they nevertheless are capable of enough directed behavior to break into reinforced buildings and methodically smash to pieces anything that would scientifically document the eclipse.) The main characters are shallow as children's action figures in a Saturday morning cartoon.Maybe this sort of nonsense was plausible at the dawn of the atomic age back in the 50's, but in today's post-9/11, post Y2k world, we know that humanity is just a bit more resilient than that.It is, however, an entertaining read."
1,disappointing,"I love Robert Sylverberg books, but this one did not made the cut. For starters how did these people know about stars and star maps if there was really no night at all. They had day light 24/7 with 4 Suns. We dont see any stars during the day with one sun alone, and they had 4 Suns! It does not make sence for an evolving civilization to experience day light nonstop, and for their people to know about star maps and astrology. When I read that It kind of blew off the story, what could have been an excellent work of science fiction was blown from the start."
1,Night could have fallen faster...,"If you're looking for this book, just read the short story- it really is good. Its in the collection ""the edge of tommorow,"" and several others."
4,German students on Nightfall (2),"The SF novel Nightfall written by SF giants Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg is placed on a six-sun planet where the population does not know darkness. Nightfall is a mysterious, well written book with interesting parallels to our planet earth, take for example the cult of the Apostles of Flame. Scientists find out that on the 19th of Theptar their planet Kalgash will become darkened by another invisible planet. This only happens every 2049 years because only then one sun - Dovim - will be shining. That's why some scientists, archeologists and maths students as well as psychologists and journalists start to work together. Nightfall is an exciting new story and not an old-fashioned one like ""Aliens come to earth... "" It's interesting to know about science on Kalgash, about its six sun system but I think the novel is one for typical SF readers."
2,Night fell...and who cares.,The book promises something special. It's premise is interesting but the characters are ultimately boring. The religious undertones are interesting but not fully developed and the climax? What climax? Once night falls the story goes awry giving us no sense of what the big deal was or was promised. What a let-down.
5,The Best Book On The Subject,"Lots of diagrams and time-line illustrations too. What a concept!If you want to learn more about the ""pre-wrath"" rapture theory, this is THE book to get."
4,What a great commentary!,"I used to be strongly pretrib until I was challenged by a friend to read Marvin Rosenthal's book The Pre wrath Rapture of the Church. Reading that book, it didn't take very long till I was forced to give up my pretrib view. After that I bought several books to prob the mind of other pre wrath teachers. However, most of the time I was very disappointed . Until I found this book. Mr. Salerno has written an excellent commentary on Revelation, in view of the pre wrath rapture. The highlights of this book are his scholarly writings on the seven churches, the antichrist, and his use of the book of Daniel. It's almost like having two commentaries in one. I would like to give this book five stars, however, due to some misinterpretations of scripture and some slight disagreeing of some of his views, I have given this book four stars. Nevertheless, my understanding of revelation is stronger because of this book."
5,Directions for life.,It's a heartwarming story of a mans journey to good health through cayenne. This book reviews many herbs as well as cayenne.
4,A Fascinating Book,"Here the author gives you first hand experience on his life after being left for dead by the medical profession. Since he has gone through what ever he says, we can certainly take his words for granted. He is a person with an extreme social conscious and he wants everyone to learn from his experience. That is why he came out with this interesting and highly informative book. In the book he says we can become drug free by making some simple changes in our life style and how we can use herbs to our heart's benefit. With his own life he has proved that many of the doctors are absolutely wrong on diagnosis of their patients' heart diseases and the time frame given for their survival.There are two things I've been craving for, this book & a nice cup of s o y f e e. You brew just like coffee and NO CAFFEINE! I can't believe it's made from so ybeans cause it taste just like coffee. Look for it online at www.s o y coffee.com. Like the book, a great find!"
2,Not what I expected,"I expected a book about cayenne pepper. I expected more scientific information. The book is mostly an autobiography by a man who has absolutely no use for doctors, conventional medicine or the FDA."
1,Quackery at its worst!,"If one carefully reads and analyzes this book, one will realize there is no objective evidence to back up Mr.Quinn's claims. If he indeed was so sure of his ""cure"" then he should have been more than willing to submit to the medical testing to back up his claims. Instead he refused to do so, and he is dead now. He did not live to be very old either! Readers must always be wary of anyone's claims to have unconventional ""cures"" for heart disease, AIDS, cancer, etc."
5,Get this book,There are many important lessons taught here by mr Quinn. Get it and read it. The information is fun to read and there is a wealth of knowledge and and a strong undercurrent of wisdom running through this book. GET IT!
1,Still the wrong item (USD 69.99) - Mar-27,"Amazon still post the wrong price/item with ASUS P4S800D-E and the problem still exist after complains. I've ordered this item in early Feb but it ship me the ASUS P4BGVMX.Amazon write me this:-----Thank you for writing to us at Amazon.com.I am sorry that your shipment was problematic.

1,Multicultural Teaching: A Handbook of Activities...,"For those who want to give multicultural education the justice it deserves, which is why the concept is trying to make its way into American ""schooling,"" DO NOT USE THIS TEXT!!! The authors state information that is both hurtful and untruthful for many groups living in the USA, since before the country's name took hold. An excellent example would be on under ""Thinking in the Early Years."" African Americans are referred to as immigrants! ""Then the slave trade began, bringing in the largest block of immigrants ever, albeit the fact that they came involuntarily"" (p. 4). I began using this in my course and now the students are analyzing it for the poor job that the authors have done with history and depicting ethnic/cultural groups in the USA. If you'd like to use this book as an exercise to see how Euro-ethnocentrism deals with people of color, then do so. But don't support nor disseminate this information. It's just bad for everyone."
1,Awful quality,"OMG, truly awful sound quality. I was excited to see a BB King album at our local recycling center, but after a quick listen I guessed why it was there instead of in someone's collection. This was ""digitally remastered"" in Canada by St. Clair Entertainment Group, Inc and one can only imagine what else they are capable of."
1,what have they done?,"I had been searching for a clean digital version of this for years. The original LP was in my collection from four decades back and I had digitized it when I made the great shift to MP3 and FLAC years ago --But what have they done to this music? It's not simply the compression. The MP3 I made years ago sounds light years better than this, even though the record was ancient and scratched."
2,Straps too short for stroller bar.,"This toy is supposed to be attached to the bar on the stroller in front of the child, versus the handle of the car seat carrier. I tried to attach it to the front of my Chico Cortina Travel System Stroller and the straps were at least and inch too short, maybe more. The instructions say not to add any additional length to the straps, so I had to return it."
5,Just what I wanted at half the price,Exactly what I needed and I found it at a price that was almost half the cost of the same item I found at a local vaccum supply store. Perfect!
3,Good deal,These work like they're supposed to. They were a much better price than I could have gotten from the Orek store near my house.
1,misrepresentation,"I typically order my vacuum bags for my oreck housekeeper canister direct from the manufacturers website, but decided to look for a better deal online. What I ended up with was not the oreck brand at all, and while the product shipped seems comparable, I believed from the description that I was paying for a branded oreck product. I don't know if the shipper is trying to pull a fast one, or if someone just made a mistake in shipping, but it also took about a month to arrive in my mailbox after ordering. Bad service-won't be ordering from these vendors again."
4,Vacuum cleaners bags. What can I say? They work.,What can I say? They work.They work. They work.They work. They work.They work. They work.They work. They work.They work. They work.They work.
5,Just as described.,"These are just as described, name brand and much easier to acquire than driving the 100 plus miles to acquire them here."
4,Oreck PKBB12DW Super-Deluxe Compact Canister Bags,This product is an original item from Oreck and works for the specific canister that I own. and got it for a great price.
5,Why I love my Oreck Super Deluxe Compact Camister Bags,"These gorgeous mint green vacuum bags are so easy to install that cleaning out the old one is not worthwhile. The improved performance of a clean bag is noticable in the Tornado like suction. Now, even the heavy bowling balls are not too great a challenge for my Oreck. Of course it is better suited to lifting dirt and dust but ya never know when a pesky bowling ball will roll under the sofa. The one thing that is for certain, it will always happen when the kids are not home to retreive it. Yes, the Oreck Super Deluxe Compact Camister Bags are a blessing in disguise."
2,"not her best, perhaps a team effort?","Ms. Douglas is not the most skilled of writers, but has made up for it in the previous entries into this series with direction and period detail, which allowed the reader to be carried along. There was much redundancy of detail in this offering, sometimes almost verbatim descriptions just a few pages hence, making me wonder if either the editor was attempting to combine various drafts in a hurry, or different writers wrote sections and the parts were hastily assembled."
3,Read The Other Series' Books First,"I had heard about this series and found this book on sale. Being a fan of historical mystery series, I broke my own rule. I read this book before reading any of the others in the series. There are constant references to past stories, leaving me wondering whether this book was simply a review of previous cases. I enjoyed the story once I got into the book but it was rough going at first. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more if I had read her earlier books beforehand."
3,Femme Fatale,"While this is an entertaining historical mystery, I nearly drowned in the excess verbage. I respect the attempt to simulate conversation of the period, I think it was badly overdone."
3,Early head-bangin` stuff!,"I`ve had a vinyl copy of this since new, and I never tire of playing it every so often. The raw energy of Kossoff, so soon to tragically take his own life, blends perfectly with the unique voice of Paul Rodgers, in this, their debut album. Its obvious that they haven`t yet developed much musical style, as each song tends to sound much the same from beginning to end, without a lot of variation. But within this album can be heard the basis of the unique ""Free"" sound, so crank up the volume and enjoy!"
1,Tons of BS,"I have to laugh at the high ratings and comparisons to Led Zeppelin and Cream here. Are you kidding?!? LOL... :DSo what do we have here? Well crappy British blooze tripe like ""Goin' Down Slow"" and ""Moonshine"". Dull crappy solos for the sake of soloing. Pointless. Not to mention the juvenile lyrics of ""Wild Indian Woman"". Rodgers should be embarrassed over that amateurish pile of dung. I hope he hasn't sung it since.I do like ""I'm A Mover"" and ""Over the Green Hills (Pt 2), but two songs don't redeem this nonsense. The rest is unmemorable, so unmemorable that I can't remember what it was all about. :)If you have it in mp3 format, do yourself a favor and keep ""I'm A Mover"" and ""Over the Green Hills (Pt 2)"" because that's all that's worth saving. The rest of it can go into the trash bin with no regrets."
3,Strange mix of songs,"I didn't know what to think at first when I had first heard this album. It sounds like a combination of alot of classic rock bands debut's ,(Cream , Black Sabbath, Scorpions first,......) it also feels like some of these songs were unfinished. Even though I feel weary about this album, it isn't that bad ,it's just missing something I can't put my finger on yet."
1,Unlikely to be admired.,"This particular FREE album is far from the usual infectuous, dynamic, and precise blues rock that segued into the illustrious BAD COMPANY."
1,waste of time,"I purchased this because Babies R us was out of the Fisher Price soothing glider and I thought this would be the same but boy was I wrong. I ended up having to exchangePro'sIt's cuteConsLaud and noisyDifficult to assembleJerky when it rocksAwkward to moveTricky to turn off and onIt was just a waste no wonder they marked them down, trust me it's not worth it"
5,Mount Vernon Love Story,"I read this story and have 4 grand daughters that I will give this book to for a Christmas gift. They are all avid readers, one having a new husband who is off to Afganistan the end of October. This book gives a lot of History about war and seperation of loved ones. It is a great story."
4,Another View of George Washington...,"This was a very interesting book. It took me a long while to get into the story, but it was a very worthwhile read. I likedhow the chapters were cut so short.This book follows George's love life. Although he didn't marry the woman he truly loved, he was very satisfied with his wife Patsy,AKA Martha. They had no children of their own, but George was loved and respected by Patsy's two children, Jacky and little Patsy.Mount Vernon Love Story had a few flaws. As mentioned before, it took me a while to get used to the writing style,and I got confused between the different time periods. But after all is said and done, I'd give this book no less than 4 stars:)"
3,George and Patsy,This is a quick read and has some good information. It's a book for the young teenagers.
3,There's a lot to learn from reading this...,"Rating this is hard for me - the development of the story and relationship between George and Martha was rather empty. Of course you have to take into consideration that the book was originally written in 1969 - BIG DIFFERENCE! But I did enjoy reading and learning more (just like all of the other readers) about the history of our 1st president and his lady. How interesting- I didn't realize George and Martha didn't have children of their own. I had visited Mount Vernon but did not realize how George had come about acquiring it. And what about the other love in George's life - Sally. I went onto the internet and was able to bring up some letters George wrote Sally. Well, I did enjoy the story and the truthfulness to it. Now adays you don't know what to believe from the movies and books that are written to pull down the characters of our fore-fathers."
3,GEORGE WASHINGTON'S LOVE LIFE,"An interesting side of George Washington I'm sure most people hadn't thought about. From his domineering mother Mary, to his lost love Sally Fairfax, to Martha ""Patsy"" Custis, GW didn't seem to have much luck with the women in his life. I didn't realize that GW never had children of his own and that he didn't particularly care for him mother. Living in Fredericksburg this novelization of GW's love life adds an interesting dimension to the Father of our country. Sparse on real detail."
2,Dull,"I was disappointed. I have read all of the author's books and found this one dull. Good thing it was small, or I might not have finished reading it. This should have been a short story rather than a novel. Plot: Washington falls for a woman already married. Marries someone else--a good mate, but perhaps not his soul mate. End of story. Also, I found the switching back and forth of time periods distracting and confusing. Not her best work!"
2,Mislead....A History Book,"I've read all her novels and expected a mistery, I was mislead its a war/history novel and boring."
4,Not what I expected but still very good,"I read this book under it's original title of ""Aspire to the Heavens"" and was pleasantly surprised. I picked it up expecting a suspense story by my favorite author and found instead a well written tale about the relationship between George and Martha Washington. The era is well researched and the Washington's relationship is human and believable.My only complaint about the book is it seemed somewhat short to me. I found myself wanting more. I felt like certain events were glossed over and could have been woven into the plot more.Still, it's an excellent read and a major departure from the ""Queen of Suspense""."
5,A great book for someone who loves history and has been interested in the Washingtons!,"I really loved this book! While it was not overly suspenseful or action packed, it didn't have to be and wasn't expected to be. I had been interested in George and Martha Washington and I absolutely love history, and I was really excited about reading this book. I got it and found it so interesting that I couldn't put it down for nearly two days!"
3,It could / should have been longer,"1. I'm going to make this brief: a solid historical novel, much better than I anticipated. It was so interesting that at the end of the book, I wished that it was longer and in more detail. That's about it."
1,hard to enjoy,"The musicians in the JIB, to include Jason himself are all talented. The only problem with this album is how hard the vocals are hard to scrape past. The whining vocals could only be matched by the original whiner himself (whom this album sounds like a watered down version of) Michael W. Be sure that you listen to this one before you buy it."
5,EXCELLENT! When the phrase books fall short . . .,"Here's a MUST-BUY item to tuck into your travel bags before you head to the airport bound for China. This book answered questions about Chinese and China I didn't even think to ask. I bought this dictionary to help teach myself to read/translate the written Chinese in several books I brought home from my recent adventures in China. It has both extensive english-Chinese and Chinese-english sections. The radical index and radical chart are great, and the basics section is clear, comprehensive and easy to understand. I only wish there was more to it! Not every word you may be looking for is here, but enough is that you may not care. For such a small volume (relatively pocket/purse-sized) it is amazingly comprehensive."
4,Nice music,"It is a good album. The rest of the songs are not as upbeat as the more popular ""Blessed Be Your Name."" However, the rest of the songs are still good. I would recommend it to someone who wants to listen to Christian music that sounds like any other type of music you would hear on the radio. Good beats and the lyrics are very inspirational."
3,Greatest hits,Ok many of the tunes have been sung all over the country in many different worship services and you might not have known they were his tunes. Matt writes great worship songs.
4,great!,"Well, geez, the previous reviewer was a little harsh. I don't think Ms. Murphey glamorized or made light of the serious work she had to do on the farm. Rather, I thought she did a great job of showing how difficult it really is. I enjoyed the book and thought it was very touching."
3,For small kids only,"This game is for kids.Help Easter Bunny find and deliver eggs to all the boys and girls of Easter Village. Unfortunately, the floppy-eared rabbit doesn't have enough eggs, so players will have to solve puzzles and play games to find more eggs. Multiple difficulty levels keep the action interesting for children aged four to ten, and several game modes offer additional play options. Parents can play along with children and add assistance with the ""helper"" feature."
3,there are better options ...,book is ok but lacks the detail and flow of say Graphic Guide to Framing ...or Journal of Light Construction guides. If your a reader and not really a hands on learner then the book may be a better fit for you. If however like me you learn by seeing a detailed picture and prefer to skip the long winded stuff..then this book is not a good fit. Also note the book does not give a lot of options...they show you one way to complete you project (except for the dormer plan)...were as say Graphic Guide gives you every way; plus a detailed drawing ie: say for a facia board trim out or venting options on a facia. As a guy that does this for a living I say your much better having all your options explained so that you can choose the best option for your situation.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I wore this around my arm for the first time, and it split open. Used it on the tread mill with a light to moderate run... looked down at my iphone to change song, my iphone split the cheap glue that was used to hold this armband together. I am very lucky that my iphone did not fall to the floor. I threw this armband in the trash!!"
2,I don't like it...,"I've just boght the armband, it's kinda big, the iphone is loose in it... hard to access the touch screen because it's big..."
2,not so bueno,"I would not recommend this product although it is the only product on the market of its kind so you really have no choice. This is probably the reason that belkin doesn't rectify the fact that the joint between the clear plastic front and neoprene separates to the point of super gluing them together. I'm not the only person that has had this problem and it will happen to you. Also, belkin's website doesn't even show that they make an armband specifically for the iPhone. Wierd."
1,This is a bad item,"This product is very bad, e in the first time that was used, unglued whole number, therefore I declare that it is of a quality very low, and request another one in substitution"
1,"Good idea, just didn't last very long","Okay, so I've been using the Armband for about 6 months, putting it on tonight to go for a run and the thing just starts to separate. Needless to say, I won't be taking it with me on the run and now I am in search for a suitable replacement since this just plain sucked. Move on and find something better."
1,"Some good ideas, poorly executed, didn't last long","The Belkin armband for the iPhone seemed pretty decent at first. I found it easy to slip the phone in and reasonably easy to get it back out at the end of a run or workout. However, the armband was always insecure on my arm, slipping down unless I kept it tight. There is a metal ""buckle"" through which the velcro strap runs to fold back on itself and hold the armband in place. This metal buckle bent immediately, and within 5 uses of this armband it broke completely. I wasn't over tightening - if I did it would be too tight.This is an overpriced piece of garbage."
1,Broke after 1 week of use,Poor design. The slit at the top of the carrier is too small for the iphone which causes the elastic to stretch to the point were it tears away from the plastic.Don't waste your money.
1,total waste doesn t last a month!,seemed very good at first but it collapsed after a few weeks of use...unfortunately a waste of money and time
1,Cheap piece of crud,Length:: 0:56 MinsReview of the very horrible and cheap Belkin F8Z170-KG Sports Armband for iPhone.. watch before you buy!!
1,Bad Design,"This product was not designed well. The plastic covering is merely glued to the armband. It makes for a nice and pretty 'flush' finish, however glue+jarring+sweat+sunlight+$400 electronic device = angry customer when the glue released and dropped iPhone on concrete. Belkin normally provides great products, but they clearly weren't thinking through this one too well."
1,Do not buy,"Came apart on it's FIRST outing. The plastic is glued (not stitched) to the face of the neoprene. The adhesive started coming loose about 20 minutes into a run. Had I not noticed it, the entire face would have become loose enough and my iPhone would have toppled to the street.I've had armbands for gen 1 iPod, iPod mini, and gen 1 iPod shuffle. Hands down the worst designed and manufactured armband I've purchased. Writing both Belkin and Amazon a letter and will update if things go south or north. For anyone considering this, please don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Might be ok for a child's arm.,"I bought the item, got it on a Friday, used it Saturday and it came apart. The main problem is the armband is way too small. I am not a big armed person by any stretch of the imagination and I had a hard time getting it to fit so it would not slide off during a workout.Because the strap is too small for me, I have to pull it a bit so the velcro catches. That looked ok at first, but by the end of my very first time using it, the plastic facing had started to detach from the backing (its merely glued on and the glue separated).Once the facing is loose, I was concerned about dropping my iPhone and bearing the expense of a new one.Belkin could do better if they added a couple inches to the strap. But, the plastic facing glued to the backing still leaves a bit of concern.If you have very small arms (child-like arms) then perhaps this will work for you."
2,Nice looking but wont last,Item looks great and worked fine for a few months. Then one day out of the blue the clear plastic part ripped apart from the rest of the arm band.
3,I tried it,"I tried this unit for my iphone it is a nice armband but the velcro is comming ,loose after 2 runs and it tears where you place the iphone in easier than i would have thought. As long as you take your time with it and not be to aggressive with it it should provide 6-8 months of service for physical activity."
1,Do not buy this product,"I had one and it is such a piece of junk. The glue holding the plastic face onto the armband gave out after only a month. Now, it is completely useless."
2,"Shoddy build quality, otherwise a 4-star item","Used this case sparingly over a year. The first issue I had was that the velcro is just glued onto the armband. When trying to feed the armband through the metal loop, the velcro would often get caught, which was a pain to deal with. Eventually, the velcro came completely unglued -- and not from the front where it was catching on the metal loop. In addition, I was trying to tighten it after slipping it on today and the metal loop broke, leaving me with a useless arm band that is falling apart.If they stitched the velcro down and used a sturdier metal loop ... I would be extremely happy with this product."
2,Made of poor quality,I would use this product when I road my bike. There was a lot of sweat but that is what sports armband is supposed to endure. After a couple of months it ripped. I was highly dissappointed in this product.
4,great for workouts and bike rides,"I have had this for over a year, it is perfect for riding my bike. I use it at the gym, it's a little bulkier than my iPod but works okay.Most of all it's a secure place for my phone when I do my bike rides. They last about 1 1/2 hour, a variety of surfaces and it stays in place. I've tried mounting it other ways, but have had it fall. This arm band keeps it securely in place and allows me to listen to music while I pedal."
1,Do not buy this product! Cheaply made.,"Like many of the other users of this product, I had it for 2 weeks and just like the gentleman in the video review you see, it split along the same side. This product is poorly made and designed."
1,Bad and disgusting product,Well... was a very bad idea to bought this armband because the first time when I used the armband broke.. and I never used with my Iphone... well bad chance... but I never to recommended for any body.... its a very bad quality product.
1,lasted 1 week,"Wish I could give it 0 stars. The cover started coming off after about a week of use. I tried to superglue it but it didn't take.Other problems: the band is too small, it's really hard to get the phone in the case, it's hard to adjust the volume buttons, and it's ugly."
2,Armband too small,"First of all the product I received is a little differnt then the image when I purchased it. No big deal though, but the thing doesn't even come close to fitting around my arm. The armband strap measures 11.80"" long, so if you have big arms, it's not going to fit. It doesn't stretch much either."
2,Nice but not good,"Its a sports arm band, but its not elastic, gets wet, the screen gets cloudy. Not the right fabric to put in an electronic device."
1,Fell apart on first use,"The item does not fit around a large bicep. On first use, had to stretch it, and it ripped apart.Hopefully Amazon excepts it as a return."
1,Should Have Listened To Reviewers,"This is garbage. Just like other reviewers said, the plastic front fell off after about a half-dozen uses. At least it wasn't the first day like some. The product would have been great otherwise. I called Belkin for a replacement as the package says it has a lifetime guarantee. Problem is, they don't make it anymore. They offered a credit, but for what? Amazon made it all good by accepting the return and crediting my Amazon.com account. Avoid this. I bought another armband at a local store. So far, so good."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. The first time he put his iphone in, it split open. It looks like it was heat-sealed, and poorly at that. Don't bother with this. Look for one that's been sewn."
1,Armband came apart after one day,"After using the armband for an hour on the treadmill, it came apart. Total waste of money. Thats all I have to say."
3,didn't last very long,Lasted almost a year and then the clasp that the armband loops through broke. I didn't have any problems with the plastic cover or using the touch screen with the plastic cover. Was worth less than $20 but I wouldn't buy it again.
1,Bought 2 - Ripped on first use,"This is an absolute waste of money, the first one ripped on the first run. Then I had an exchange, and the second one ripped after a few weeks. The plastic screen is brittle and glued in. I do not Reccommend this product. Sort your act out Belkin."
2,Definitely not the product that is advertised,"For those of us who enjoyed Boney M in the 70s', this DVD is worth buying purely for presenting a fairly good collection of their hit songs. However, the production of this DVD seems like a home project by some Korean guy who is smart to market & make some money on Amazon. ""DTS Surround"" is mentioned on the cover but the only audio available is in stereo. The songs are not in their respective order as per the label. While the DVD cover mentions ""Live"", many of the songs are studio recordings & some of the live material does not seem to sync with the singers'lip movements.Be careful when you buy this."
1,Rotten Apple,"""Mirror mirror on the wall...who is the fairest of them all?""In response to the mirrors reply, Kay Stauble delivered her poisonous apple in the form of a book."
1,boring,"Reading this book was much like reading a 12 year old girl's diary. It was full of petty differences and jelousy twords the ""other woman"". I would have to say a waste of time and money."
1,Why?,"I agree with Dr. Howard, it was like reading the writing of a child who is 12. I would hope Stauble finds a therapist to work through her feelings of insecurity about her appearance and financial status. I guess ""humble"" wouldn't be a word one would use to describe her. Definitely a sign of inferiority."
2,To Mandy,I reckon one with all that ed-u-ba-cation would some day write one of those things called books...but to bash my Maw and step daddy that live in the sticks in a lil old barn... is just down right rude. I sure do wonder (with this pea sized brain of mine) if my sweet step sister could ever forgive me given this poorly written book a one star..... (By the way Mandy....good try)(I gave you an extra star for that last comment...that was just so darn good an all!)
1,Poorly Done,"If you haven't read enough books about peoples true life childhoods, then I guess you should read this book. I personally think that by reading it I have wasted hours of my life that I can't get back. The book is poorly written and moves about as fast as a five car pile up during rush hour traffic. Apparently the writer has never read Affel Fuagar's ""Debutantes Reborn""."
3,Sad But Also Inspiring...,If Tears Could Speak was a surprisingly interesting and inspiring story about a woman who had more than her share of bad luck and hard times in life and yet she manages to rise above that and take hold of a faith thathelps her become an amazing woman. I thought the book would be a little longer but it was okay because the story was told just as well.
5,Excellent Film!,Really enjoyed this movie! It gets to the heart of the matter of what the Feds and the cops don't want the general population to know about.... The director does an incredible job bringing center stage what most officials would prefer stay behind the scenes. A must see!
4,Durable but the size was off,"I've been using Speedo swimsuits, and this would be my third one in the course of two years swimming on and off. The others were lycra, more stretchy but less durable, fabric starts to break down. This one feels more durable with thicker and rougher material. Training wise I would not mind some drag, but I really could have gone one size down for this suit. It was definitely a good price!"
2,Not the right cut,"Speedo suits are very good quality, but I can never wear one. The cut for the butt is terrible! Maybe if I had a tiny butt it wouldn't be a problem but I cannot wear this suit in public because it only covers a little more than half my butt."
5,mom,I order these crackers for my mom who eats them to stay regular. I call them dog biscuits yuck yuck.
4,Looks Cool,I have four 130watt KC Hilite Long range beams sitting on the light bar (on top of Jeep Cherokee). The bar holds them well and they look really cool. I cut and installed the light bar myself (not a mechanic by any means). It was not too difficult to install. The reason I give it 4 stars versus 5 stars is I feel like it could be mounted on the car with a slightly more secure method. I was nervous it would fall off so had my mechanic check it and tighten it up a bit.
3,Great text badly edited and poorly published,"Akron and Banzhaf's text is insightful and oracular, giving diviners plenty of poetic and mythic depth to work with as they discern the meanings of the cards and their spreads. If you're prepared to do the work, this text will at least grant you entry into Crowley's symbolic universe, as it has for me. The rest is, of course, your own adventure.The book's failing is the staggeringly low standard of editing and publication. Wrong card images on some pages, typos on many pages, uneven editing of the translation, and a cheap ""exploding"" binding (leaving pages falling out within weeks of purchase) really take the shine off an otherwise excellent book."
3,I read this in 2004,"It's a decent book and it IS enlightening as far as the Thoth Tarot deck is concerned. (((I learned a few very good Tarot Spreads, too, for example, as well as a lot of insight into Crowley's Thelemic Symbolism depicted on every key and card.)))Well worth the prices now being offered. (((And better than Banzhaf's ""RWS vs. Thoth Comparison Guide,"" as well, IMHO!!!)))"
3,"Read my review, don't look at the 3 stars","Well, this book is good for the more advanced. I really like the Crowley Tarot cards; yet, I've been told this is too advanced for a beginner. I don't care... I wanted it. :)But, the book is a bit hard to understand. I think it gives excellent details about all the symbols. But, there is just so much to swallow for someone new to it. I bet this book is great for those that have a better grasp of Tarot reading. I can't interpret what the interpretations mean. I know that sounds odd, but I just don't know how to apply the information in the book with what my cards show. I get a somewhat jist of it, but I know I'm missing out on alot, since this book has so much detailed information that I just wish I could understand.The other thing is the book itself was not bound well. It fell apart not too long after I had it, some of the pages separated.I hope to find books about the Crowley Tarot more easily understood."
2,Accessing The Cosmos,"I have used this book for a number of years, along with Angeles Arrien's book on the Tarot. The Crowley Tarot is very helpful in providing insight into the symbols and their meanings cross culturally and in their interpretations both from a cosmological perspective as well as a psychological one. The authors also provide a history of the Tarot and a bit on Crowley himself and some of the controversy around the person."
2,too many cobblestones,"At first glance, this book seems to be very thorough and well-informed. However, the more I attempted to use it, the more it seemed to use too many words to say too little. This may be because it is translated from German, perhaps lacking the flow and comprehensibility of the original text. Either way, the card ""interpretations"" are far from concise and tend to meander, resulting in a rather unfocused treatise, sometimes verging on pedantic... The ""biographical"" section on Crowley seems a bit questionable... ""The Crowley Tarot"" does have some redeeming qualities, however; the numerous card spread systems are well illustrated and explained, and the ""music"" and ""art"" correspondences for the trumps are interesting.A difficulty arises in recommending a clear and informative work on Crowley's tarot. ... There's plenty of information in ""The Crowley Tarot"", but it is questionable as to how much of it is necessary or useful..."
3,"Great for the Advanaced Reader, difficult for the beginner.","This book is somewhat complicated to read if you are the beginner. If you are more advanced this book allows you to connect many divergent systems into the complex metaphor that is Tarot. The authors have explored the vast meanings of Aleister Crowley and Lady Frieda Harris and used their interpretations consistently to explain the Tarot. This book is probably the closest representation to what Aleister Crowley intended his deck to be. This book explores the patterns of the I Ching, the Tree of Life, Music, Runes, Astrology, Deities, and Rituals. You can spend years extending your knowledge through the levels they suggest."
5,My Opinion...,"...is that this is the best, most informative, book of the Thoth version of Tarot available. I have had versions which I have worn out from use. Now I keep one on hand for reference."
1,Battery chareger,Already looking for another one beacuse this one has given me problems from the get go....
3,product ok but a small package,product was ok but was expecting a container bigger than my lipstick . product arrived promptly. would by again. thanks
1,Mini or Maxi,"I bought this so that I could tuck it away when not in use, so on the first rainy day, it was more like a shower, I thought I would give it a try, I must of received a defective one because mine wouldn't stay open, and when it did, it buckled under the smallest amount of wind and turned inside out, I am now attempting to return it but am having the hardest time trying to get the seller to email me a return code and hopefully a pre-paid label."
3,Lots of T&A from the '70s.,"2 movies to a disc side on this colection. None are great movies, but there is plenty of T&A for the perverts. Two of these films (Bottom's Up and The Swinging Stewardesses) looked like a slightly edited porno film (removing the penetration scenes.) Baby Cat contained minor T&A. I have not seen Mad Mad Moviemakers yet, but considering it is rated PG, I doubt it has any nudity."
