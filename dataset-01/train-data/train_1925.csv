2,My opinion: this shampoo is majorly overpriced.,"I gave this shampoo 2 stars because it does clean hair as advertised. I am very unhappy with the underlying medicinal-herbal scent. I do not believe this shampoo is worth the $18.00 price charged for it. Lather, Inc.: can't you pretty up the smell?"
5,Nice Sound - Great Price,"I put 6 of these in 3 different rooms of my house. They were easy to install and the sound is pretty good for cheap speakers. Not a lot of bass, but I was not expecting much - it does the job I wanted to have some music around the house."
3,"not bad, not great","you get what you pay for. works for my install in a small convenience store, which doesnt need audiophile quality. lacking on the low end, which was expected."
3,ok for the cost,good product but the casing has a poor quality and I received the speaker with two differnt tones of white (one greenish and one blueish) return them immediately.bought the OSD ICS5030 instead
1,Contents: One Pair,"When I opened the box that read ""Contents: One Pair"", I found only one (1) speaker. :(The product description page also read (pair), which is why I ordered these speakers.The wording on the web page and product box is misleading and untrue."
4,Excellent,"Perhaps the clearest exposition of Ficthe's 'Wissenschaftslehre.' An elaborate and logically tight outline of the act of self-consciousness. Fichte is attempting to identify the proposition 'I am I' as the absolute ground of all knowledge. There are amazing developments to critical philosophy in this dense material, though the status of the 'not-I' remains logically obscure. Fichte also takes on all his interlocutors in typically belligerent fashion; although the logical form of his argumentation is precise, he is unable to circumvent the ontological problems that Holderlin would later pose. Still this is more than a transitional footnote between Kant and Hegel-it is an extraordinary tour de force of thinking."
3,Doctrine of Science,"You know when the title is mistranslated that you are in for trouble. ""Wissenschaftslehre"" is correctly translated as ""Doctrine of Science,"" not ""Science of Knowledge."" Fichte wants to convince us that there is no thing-in-itself. There is only a phenomenal, appearing, world. Your Ego ""posits"" itself and creates an image of an external world (an Id). Schopenhauer likened this philosophy to a spider's philosophy. The Ego, like a spider, spins the known world out from itself in the way that a spider spins its web. Was Fichte right? Is there no thing-in-itself?"
2,Not up to the standards of this series,"The ""you wouldn't want to ..."" series is great to teach children history, because it shows what life was like. How gladiators trained, how knights fought, and so on. This is very interesting for children.This book only mentions a few details of daily life. Instead, it is a list of battles with their dates and a few details. That makes it boring and irrelevant to the target audience.Save your money for something really good, such asYou Wouldn't Want to Live in a Wild West Town! (You Wouldn't Want to...)orYou Wouldn't Want to Be an American Pioneer! (You Wouldn't Want to...)"
5,Midwest Book Review,"Civil War Soldier: Looks at America's bloodiest war from the perspective of what it was like to serve from both sides. The book explores everything from enlistment to medical treatments for injuries. This is a delicate subject to approach when writing a book for children and in my opinion Thomas Ratliff has done a superb job of getting the facts across in a serious yet entertaining way that is not threatening. I found it to be an enjoyable read filled with little known facts about the life of a soldier during service.-The Midwest Book Review, May 2004"
1,Appalling book,"This is one of the worst books for kids I have ever seen. The text is OK, but the illustrations are terrible. It is done in a cartoon manner, but it makes the soldiers of the Civil War look like a bunch of buffoons. I know the idea is to appeal to young boys--but this book goes too far. On one page dead soldiers are laying in a battlefield--their butts are up in the air and they look more drunk than dead. Scenes depicting amputations are made to look humerous. This is no way to present history. Kids are already de-sensitized to violence, and this book makes it look funny. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
3,"Smaller size points break, and cords are too thick.","I was so excited about getting this set, but it has left me a little disappointed. One of my size 6 points snapped in half during my first project. I also am not thrilled with the cords. They are kind of ""sticky"" when you're knitting smaller guage projects. The yarn doesn't really slide very well on them and you have to constantly push it along.I'm giving it 3 stars because it does work very well for the projects using the larger points, and I like the ""snapping"" connection rather than the kind you have to screw in."
2,"Great, but very Opinionated","I can hardly believe that Edward Tufte, the great guru of design wrote this one. It's great to raise issues, act negative, and point out problems. Let me be frank, today everyone needs to create PowerPoint presentations in so many ways including webcasts. How does Edward Tufte plan to tackle that? Rather than explain how to work around limitations and accept PowerPoint as just another medium, this book goes into a directionless tirade against Microsoft's program.Incidentally, I just read another book and can't resist adding this note here. I love the way color theory for presentations is explained in another book. I always thought Dummies books were for dummies. Now I've changed my opinion. Maybe, it's time Edward Tufte should accept presentations as part of business and industry and use his design ideas to help us create better presentations."
4,Thanks - easy enough,The seller transacted this process very quickly and the publication was in my mailbox the next week. Very good transaction and product was better than described.
1,Not Terribly useful,"Not a particularly useful product, I gave it to my boss who does nothing but bitch about the evils of Powerpoint presentations..."
5,An enjoyable indictment,"Tufte makes a cogent case against PowerPoint in this sleek, catalog-sized volume, blaming it for, among other things, the Columbia disaster. He recommends paper handouts as an alternative for anyone presenting serious science, numbers-intensive business, or anything else requiring thought. Does he go a bit overboard? Certainly. But that's what makes the book fun rather than pedantic. Everyone in my PhD program has read it at some point with great interest, pondered it for a while, and then reverted to using PowerPoint. C'est la vie.However, before you buy this, realize that this volume is also a chapter in Tufte's latest full-sized design book,Beautiful Evidence. If, like me, you enjoy having Tufte's works on your shelves, then this excerpted edition is of little use."
4,Excellent overview of PowerPoint Tool,"This document is an excellent review without prejudices of a very common Office tool: PowerPoint. It is the proof that common tools are not necessarily good tools or professional tools.Only to mention that this sepparate chapter can be found included in the book ""Beautiful Evidence"", also by E. Tufte."
1,Don't waste your money,This short article - it is not long enough to be called a book - is more of a rant than useful instruction. Save your money. He has written several good books on data presentation; this is not one of them.
4,Not perfect but...,"Sometimes, being shown what not to do and what does not work is actually more helpful than being shown what does."
2,No useful information in this book,"If there were a fan club for Edward Tufte, I would gladly sign up to be an officer. His three books changed the way I think about presenting information, and added the invaluable term ""chartjunk"" to my vocabulary. I was enormously excited to learn that he had written about Powerpoint and could hardly wait to lay my hands on the publication. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait.To those thinking about buying this booklet (28 pages) let me save you the expense by summarizing it:PowerPoint slides don't have much information in them, and you're limited to a sequential presentation order.That's about it. His booklet is an extended indictment of the limitations of PowerPoint. Anyone interested in suggestions for Powerpoint improvements will find a refernce on the last page in a postscript to read the third chapter of his book, Visual Explanations, or visit his web site.Do that instead of reading this booklet."
2,Not Very Constructive Criticism,"Tufte is an gifted analyst and communicator, but seems to have taken the easy way out on this publication. He rails against the limitations of PowerPoint, of which there are many, but does not provide much in the way of practical recommendations."
5,Great deal!,"These jade earrings are so beautiful. My only complaint was that the stone in one earring is a little loose. I'm sure it would cost nothing to have it tightened. Even with the cost of that, these are worth it. The lever backs are sturdy and well made. Who doesn't love jade? Gorgeous!"
3,da next best superman after reeve,i was an on and off fan of the lois and clark the new adventures of superman i would watch this show after watching my superman marathon movies and cartoons during the weekend when i was about [...] but dean cain was not a bad choice to be the next superman and the pretty actress to be loise lane was the right decision as well she was one of the man reasons i watched this show one of my favorite eposides that i can remember is when superman had a evil clone who trained to take off metropolis but the good superman would let him do that but that eposibe is a remake from all the superman 3 movies and the old skool superman tv television show but it never gets old in my book i might be wrong but i wish christmas reeve would have made appearance as dean cain on screen alien father from the crypton
4,Super Wow!!,I thought that second season was when everything in Lois and Clark really started to click. I of course like everyone else was on the edge of my seat in the end wondering if Lois would say I do or not. Great season and can't wait untill season four comes out on DVD.
3,Lois & Clark Complete 2nd season,"I have no problems with the product delivered, this is satisfactory. However I requested to cancel my order but was not done."
4,A young and successful season.,"According to the directors, crew and fans, this was a favorite season. Dean Cain is very young, more convincing as Superman than Clark Kent. However, he still is the best chosen actor to play Superman."
5,Quriky romantic comedy with comic book roots,"All of the exuberant enthusiasm and childish delight with the unbelievable from its comic book roots, crossed with the smart, adult dialog of a quirky romantic comedy. The villians trying to do away with L&C threaten them with real harm, but the foibles of the villians are exaggerated to let the viewer know that Lois and the Man of Steel will prevail in the end. Year 2 takes Lois and Clark from the apparent death of Lex Luthor up to Clark's marriage proposal to Lois."
5,"Awesome book! Interesting, inspiring and insightful..","I found myself not wanting to finish this book! There were so many things I could relate to and didn't think anyone else had experienced or thought about! The book is very funny, yet also quite touching. I can't wait for the author's next book!"
4,Enjoyable reading,I truly enjoyed reading this book. It made a long day of airports and flight delays bearable. The characters are great. I found myself relating them to people I know. I hope there is a sequel!
4,preview,"A friend recommended this book. What is it with all of the word of mouth reviews here? What, does the author have to pay for their own maketing or something?(haha)'Tis a good thing.The sign of a good author is when their very first book has a clever structure in telling their tale. When the beginning & end smartly dovetail into each other. When the humor for the most part inspires audible responses. And when one actually cares what the characters will face next, & how they will respond. But mostly the best sign is the book gets better & better as it goes along. Make you wonder where that will lead to, & if the author will have to courage to keep digging that path in futures tales. Personally, i dig it so far."
4,John Mosby,I was very well satisfied with my purchase and the book was what I ordered and in the shape discribed.
2,"Do yourself a favor, buy the originals","Hey, I love and admire the Tadd Dameron, Miles and the gang, but their music is still available and generally of better quality on their original recordings. Great line-up of musicians but my collection just doesn't need another re-work of say, ""Tadd's Delight."" So you want to hear ""If You Could See Me Now"" pick up ""Send in the Clowns"" by Sarah Vaughn and Count Basie - it'll blow your mind. Beyond that, Joe just doesn't cut it here artistically. His sound is off and he just seems to have nothing new to add. This one got old real fast for me."
3,Elementry,This is way too basic and reveals way too much but is state spoecific so it may or may not apply to your state.
5,The Roof is on Fire...,"Strong, pulsing, driving electric band and deep vocal range. You can't listen to this music and not dance! YOU WANT to be at one of her concerts in Rio! 'nough said. go buy."
2,Well Researched but Written in Prolix Style,"Allison Graham's FRAMING THE SOUTH offers a penetrating insight into the way Hollywood and the television networks of the 1950s and 1960s neutralized many of the issues concerning the struggle for civil rights happening in the United States. Many producers were simply scared to confront difficult material; they preferred instead to rehearse established conventions of white supremacy and/or 'redemption' associated with moving to the north of America from the 'unsophisticated' South. Graham's work represents a considerable effort of research, but her writing-style is unnecessarily prolix. She manages to make suggestive subjects sound rather mundane; this is due to a tendency to repeat herself, as well as using long rambling sentences. I can't help feeling that this is something of a missed opportunity."
3,Fun comic,"Cute comics from the creator of ""The Simpsons"". I love Matt Groening's ""other stuff""! I like Akbar & Jeff's various business schemes and relationship problems. Fun to leaf through!"
3,Not well made like most Osters,"I bought this because I thought it was a great combination of a blender and food processor. That's how it was advertised where I purchased it. I almost took it back, but ended up keeping it. The black screw on base is NOT the same heavy duty plastic of most oster blenders, and mine cracked within the first 3 uses.When I compared it to my old oster blender base, I was surprised how much thinner the plastic was. The old heavy duty base does fit on this though, so I replaced the thin one that came with the fusion with my old regular oster blender base. My other main objection is that the lid does not fit well. You can only fill the pitcher about half full, or the liquid flies out around the lid. The lid actually fits kind of funny. I have to hold the lid on while using this product, even if I don't fill the pitcher very full. It does seem to blend well, and chops things somewhat, but it is not a replacement for a food processor by any means."
1,LOUD...Returning it tomorrow!,"As many before me have said. When this machine is on one of the programed cycles, it sounds like a jet is taking off in my kitchen. Honestly I have never heard anything so loud before come from something so small. I thought when I read other reviews about the noise, that maybe those people were just ""Picky"" and that it would be okay. Well....it is not! It seriously sounds like it is about to explode! Not to mention it could not even chop up cashews. A very soft nut. Yet I am supposed to believe it will chop ice? I then tried to blend a Yogurt smoothie and it would not blend. Pushed everything up the sides and just spun out of control mixing air. I had to do what I did with my old machine and constantly remove the lid and push all the ingridiants back down with a large spoon. Waste of $70+. I am returning mine tomorrow. This was such a waste of money and time because I now have to ruturn this piece of junk. Do not buy!"
4,Good product - Good price,Works as advertised. The machine is a little noisy (as most blenders are) but seems to have plenty of power and capacity. Not a vitamix but ok for now.
3,Oster Blender,"I absolutely loved this powerful blender when I first got it. However, over time, I guess it was a bit too powerful, as the bottom part of the blender that attaches to the caraffe cracked in half and broke--- it's made of plastic :( I haven't contacted the company yet to see if this part can be replaced, but hopefully it can be done so with a minimal charge. My grandmother's Oster has been working for over 40 years flawlessly... I was hoping for the same everlasting quality."
1,Do NOT buy this blender! It's defective!,"I purchase one in June 2007. By November it quit working; it would just not turn on. I complained violently to Oster and they sent me a replacement unit and by April that unit crapped out with the same problem. I have had several Oster blenders over the years and they all have failed prematurely. Their quality is horrible and they obviously don't care. I am sick of filling up my blender with ingredients just to turn it on to find out it won't work.Yea, this model was OK while it was working, but it is not worth the hassle.DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER!"
3,A Decent Blender For The Price....,"I received my New Oster 7 Speed Fusion Earlier this week, & have used it Several Time Daily every day since... Its An EXCELLENT Blender Overall, Powerful & Efficient... However, its Very Noisy, & The Top Cap is very Cheaply Made & poorly fitting. Also, the Glass Pitcher must be held down at High Speeds when nearly full, as it shakes so very much & seems unbalanced.... I like the Blender, but wish its Fit, Form & Function was Better Designed. Overall, I love its Thorough Blending Power Most Of All.... mvc"
1,A Dud!,"Have only had this Oster Fusion blender for about a year and use it only for chopping cabbage for cole slaw probably 2 X per month, max. The base broke and water went down through my bottom cabinet drawers and made a mess of everything! I was not happy. It was a gift, but I wouldn't recommend it, and wouldn't buy it myself."
3,"Works OK, not great","My husband bought this as a combo food processor/ blender.It does not do a good job at either task. It will blend smoothies and milkshakes, but most everything else gets caught in the blades, so only the food very close to the blades gets blended. 90% of the container never blends. So then you have to stick a spatula or knife to depress the food, which is mighty dangerous.Cleaning is a HUGE hassle.For blending, now I use my kitchenaid immersion blender. And I am on the hunt for a proper food processor."
2,Broke in first month and very loud,"I bought this blender because I thought it would be great for smoothies and daily breakfast shakes. It worked fine for a few weeks and then for no reason, the first 2 speeds quit working. Only the highest speed works and it is so loud I have probably ruined the entire family's hearing using it. When it is working, it works great other than the noise, but I had my old blender for 20 years and I don't think a blender should stop working properly this quickly or be so unpleasantly loud."
2,Adapter for food processor broke after 5 months,"My food processor portion broke after about 5 months when it started making a loud screeching noise and the food processor blades stopped turning. Prior to that, I found the food processor portion in general to be unreliable in that it didn't always lock properly onto the motor base. The blender still works and is admittedly quite powerful, however."
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if that was an option,"I had this blend for 3 weeks. Worked pretty well during those 3 weeks until it suddenly just stopped working completely. Would not even turn on. I of course had thrown the receipt and manual away (stupid me). Oster doesn't even have this model's user manual available online. My only option for warranty work requires that I ship the blender (at my expense) to a 3rd part repair shop with my receipt (which I don't have). So, I'm out of luck and I have a $50 paper weight. This will be my last Oster product."
1,Oster blenders are cheap junk,I've blown out at least three of their blenders doing nothing more strenuous than making smoothies. They're just cheap junk; I would not recommend buying one.
5,Very Nice,I bought this about 4 months ago after reading the reviews here and waited to place my own review till I actually gave it a good run through.To date it has worked flawlessly. Absolutely no ice chunks - meaning it really blends everything well. As far as the noise I don't have a problem with it because I wanted a powerful motor for my smoothies.The only negative I guess that I would have is the pour spout seems to wide and does not give a clean pour. Maybe I am too impatient...Be careful these blades are SHARP!I have recommended this to family and friends.
2,Blender Stops Working,"I am now on my third blender, and it just quit working after using it only twice! All three have, after a short period of time, stopped dead; and done so with no provocation, just sitting on the counter. While this blender is working, it is 5-star, which is why I have replaced each one. But, after three duds, that's it for me!"
1,"Mine is dead, too!","Like others here, my Oster Fusion died after less than two months' use. I did it enjoy it while it worked, but now it is trash. The store I purchased it from accepts returns in 30 days. I've contacted Oster about it, but I suspect they won't do anything about it and a replacement would also die in a short amount of time."
5,The last of Nigel Findleys novels before he passed away.,"The last of the great Nigel Findleys novels where he takeshis favorite character Dirk Montgomery a former cop whoquits and works in the shadows and places him in his (Nigel)favorite place, Hawaii. Where he once again has to stopan unstopable force of evil to save the world. If your a fan ofguns, magic and creatures of legend this is a book to read"
3,"Nice, but only 14 pages","The production values are good, 8"" x 10"" prints on good quality paper (non-glossy) with large margins, good color and a soft pastel like quality (it isn't quite a photorealistic or sharp quality but it is very attractive and adds a nice romantic quality).Just be aware that there are only 14 pictures (printed on one side of a page) plus 2 pages of text."
5,caffeine boost,this fresh minty product tingles and also supposedly provides a trans-dermal dose of the stimulant caffeine. Cool package and graphics. Good conversation starter in your bathroom.
3,Stephen K. Hayes - Ancient Art of Ninja Warfare,I was a little disapointed that the cover has something hard stuck to it and the pages were yellowed. I would have liked to know the condition of the book with a little more specifics. The book itself is interesting.
4,Heart is where you start,Book is good for understanding yoga and why it is practiced and an ongoing learning process.
4,Good for understanding the origins and practice of Yoga.,This book is interesting but is a somewhat detailed read. It teaches the background of yoga and ideas toward developing a personal plan toward practicing yoga.
3,History on Yoga,"Nice, easy book to understand yoga and where it came from. Good book to have to refer to every once in a while on history of teachers spreading yogic practices, on Pranayam and some basic yoga posture. Useful to me as a teacher. Reference book."
5,This is it!,"Being a yoga teacher, I am often asked if there were only 1 book on yoga that I could recommend, which would it be? The answer is The Heart of Yoga. There is no hidden agenda here. The essence of yoga from the heart of a yogi. My second choice would be Srivatsa Ramaswami's--Yoga for the Three Stages of Life: Developing Your Practice As an Art Form, a Physical Therapy, and a Guiding Philosophy. Second only because it did not have a translation of the Yoga Sutras included, as does The Heart of Yoga."
5,"forget the rest, this is the best!","Many yoga books and classes these days overly emphasise the asana, the postures. As a consequence the idea of achieving perfect postures has become synonomous with Yoga. Desikachar lays out in simple and easy to follow writing, the idea that the postures are but one of the many tools of yoga. Furthermore he emphasises the concept of adapting the yoga to suit the individual, rather than the individual attempting to force themselves to suit the yoga. An absolutely brilliant book that demystifies asana, pranayama, and bandha, and gives an excellent account of what yoga actually is. Desikachar's approach applies to everyone no matter what 'style' of yoga you are doing. The concepts he discusses are universally applicable."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I ordered this with Bob Marley in mind. No, I didn't expect it to sound like him. I have his music already. But what I was hoping for was the upbeat style of his music. The selections are fun to listen to once in awhile, but they are a bit tame for my taste. I think it's a good introduction to the Caribbean in general, but it doesn't make me get up and dance. Well, except for one piece. I wish I could have listened to the entire CD before my purchase."
4,Awesome Island Tunes,If you're looking for something with an island sound that is not steel drum-esque then this CD is for you! There are rich tracks and a good variety of sounds!
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"Based on the reviews I was looking for a really ""happy"" CD. I was disappointed. It's not that the music was bad - just not as glorious as some of the reviews made it sound."
4,"Greate, one of the kind for a caribbean taste",To dance and feel the Caribbean soul a enjoy holiday vacations at home
5,Nice CD,"Nice music, I ordered it as a Christmas present for my husband who collects Putumayo music. He loved it. Thanks"
3,poor customer service from tool fetch,"Tool fetch claims in an email that they shipped my torque wrench, I received this email more than 2 days later after receiving an acknowledgement email from them that i canceled my order. on the amazon site it still shows that my order is shipping soon and i canceled my order about 3 days ago. What should i do, double cancel it? I have not received this item yet and no longer want it as of about 3 days ago. IT looks to me that tool fetch is very slow at filling orders. I ordered a snap-on torque wrench directly from amazon and that should be here tomorrow as they gave me a tracking number with that order unlike tool fetch."
5,Best thing I've found for rounding out a tele's sound.,"I put this in with a EVH smooth pot for volume and what a difference this makes, no load means crisper tone. I would recomend this to anyone who wants to get a lot more straight tone out of your tele....."
5,Old school,Great cd. Should have more than one hit. Nice listening. I had been searching for this cd for a while before my sister told me to go to amazon.com and yes !!!!!
4,loved it,Gorgeous cinematography- really makes me miss Texas.Great performances by the cast. I especially enjoyed James Thomas Gilbert's character.Definitely recommended!
4,"Great Camera, small quirks","The CX7300 is the third Kodak camera I have owned, and thus far it has been the best. The price is great and the camera is very easy to use with a lot of great options. The Kodak EasyShare Software is some of the best photo software on the market. The camera takes high quality pictures for only being 3.2 mp.I only had a few issues with the camera. My main problem is that there is no cover for the lens. Even with the camera turned off you can touch the plastic lens covering. The second problem I had is that there is also no cover for the connection port on the bottom of the camera. You have to get a case for this camera if you are going to take it outdoors with you in order to avoid dirt, damage and other problems with both parts of the camera."
5,Happy! (at last),"This is my third digital camera in the past 2 weeks. The first one was an Aiptek, but that felt so flimsy that I was sure it wouldn't last 2 days. The second was an HP, which guzzled batteries like they were going out of fashion. This, being the third, works like a charm. I am using the batteries that came along with the camera for the past 3 days, and so far, no signs of dying!! The software is just superb. For about $100, this camera is a steal! The picture quality is as good as HP, maybe even better! The camera feels strudy, the controls are easy to use and the menus very simple. Whats more, Kodak gives a one-year limited warranty. (HP gave only a 3 month warranty!)"
3,Where is the zoom?,"This camera is good for beginers, and for quick snapshots. However, there is no optical zoom on the camera, making any picture that has been zoomed in very pixelated and blurry. Even thought it has 3.2 megapixels, I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the picture."
1,You get what you pay for!!,"I bougt this camera and a Olymus camera, both in the same price range, the Kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship. Avoid this at all cost the Olympus was well made, durable, higher quality picture and ease of use."
2,You get what you pay,"Don't waste your money with this camera, it doesn't have optical zoom and it goes thru the batteries very very quickly-so you will need to buy rechargeable batteries. But for less than $100 you can't expect much.On the other hand the software is very user friendly as is the camera."
2,Not Satisfied,I bought this camera and returned it after a couple weeks. Almost all my pictures had red eye even though I had the red eye reduction on at all times.
4,Great camera overall,I bought this as a gift for my nine year old daughter. It's great. Not complicated to work at all. Bought it used and still in great working order. Only negative is that it doesn't have a button to zoom. You have to use the display (instead of the view hole) and then you are able to zoom. It took us a little while to discover this.
2,dont use the zoom,"I have had this camera for 3 yrs now and like it for the most part but hate that you cant zoom in and have a picture turn out, everytime I have zoomed in for a picture it has NEVER turned out the pictures ALWAYS look grainy and look like its raining ! and its not good for moving objects its too slow!"
3,"Ok, but not the best.",This camera is a good basic camera taking pretty good pics. It doesn't hold battery life to the best extent. It is a good starter camera but isn't the best.
5,Very Easy To Use,This is my first digital camera and I am in love with it. It's very easy to use straight out of the box. The picture quality is great. The editing software makes it easy to edit pictures and share with friends. A great digital camera for beginners.
4,Great Camera,"What a wonderful camera. My first digital camera, works wonderful. Pictures are breath taking. When looking through the digital viewfinder the quality is not the best(6/10), but when you snap the picture it's great(9/10). I have only used it indoors so I don't know outdoor quality. Please buy alot of batteries!! It is now 1:20PM I have been using it since Midnight and Im on my thrid pack(2xAA) of batteries!! It eats them quickly I have taken about 50 pictures(highest quality) and 40secs of video. This camera is so simple and none of the features have been left out of it. Kodak's Photoshare software is wonderful, and easy to use. Besides battery life this camera is a 4/5. Wonderful for the expert or first time user."
1,VERY Poor Quality at night,"Thanks for nothing, Kodak. I thought that buying a Kodak would be a safe option. Sorry to find that the camera is extremely blurry at night, in both flash and auto mode. I would recommend that anybody wanting a digital camera spend the extra money and buy something a little more expensive. This one leaves me with worse pictures than I have ever seen on any analogue snappy camera."
3,good point and shoot...for beginers,"If you really want a good digital camera, you need to go and get one with more MP. the more MP the better the camera. Other than that, the camera is nice, just not advanced like a lot of other cameras. That is only my opinion though. I like to have other features on mine, unlike this one. if you ever want to buy a digital camera, I also recomend going to a store like Best Buy (or another store like that, not wlmart or anything). That way you can have an on hands feel of the camera. go to the store before buying. they will even show you how to use the camera. that is your best bet. don't order on line. it took me about 2-3 trips to look at cameras before i bought one. it's something to invest in, so get a good one!"
1,Worst Camera I have ever had,this camera was a waste of $200 at Circuit City. the glare protection was messing with my pictures.
5,Great Camera,The Kodak Easyshare CX7300 is a great camera. The picture quality is great and the camera is very easy to use. It is very easy to get started as they walk you through all the steps. The software is also very easy to use. You can easily blow pictures up without major loss of quality even at 8x10in. If you use the zoom (digital) the quality drops quickly.It does eat up batteries quickly so I recomend a battery charger but that is usual with digital cameras. The movie mode is also pretty good. The movie size is small (only 320x240) but it is a great for catching those special moments.My only complaint is that the camera does not come with a lens cover so extra care must be taken.The CX7300 is a great camera for it's price and is very user-friendly. It is great for digital camera beginners.
4,Good Starter Camera,"I bought this for my 8 year old. (very responsible 8 year old)She graduated from instant and advantix brands and constantly wanted to borrow my sony cybershot....This camera is very easy, point and shoot. Great for a digital beginner. Pictures are great. Everything is auto. You will definitely need a regargeable battery pack. Close ups and ""nearer"" shots only...don't expect to zoom....like I said..for the beginner, or the untechnical that want a good camera."
3,CAUTION,I really like the camera. However if you get one get the printer dock too. I down loaded pictures off to my computer with the cheesey cable pluged into the side MAYBE 4 times and it quit working. The small wires located inside the camera that attach to the cable got stuck and bent. Now I have to buy a dock for the camera to download pictures to my computer. Though it should work longer than that...and believe me I was being very careful because the connection looked alittle fragile.
4,AHH DANG!,"THIS CAMERA IS SO FUN! FIRST OF ALL I LIKE HOW EASY IT IS TO USE. SECOND OF ALL I LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS YOU CAN PUT YOUR PICTURES ON, AND THIRD OF ALL I LIKE THE SIZE AND SYLE OF THIS CAMERA. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO GET IT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR YOUR FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA BECAUSE ITS PERFECT!"
3,Not Recommended,"I bought this camera as a gift for a family member because the price was very reasonable and the reviews said it was a great start up digital camera even for the technologically unsavy. Although it is very very easy to use and share the pictures, the photo quality leaves much to be desired. Outdoor photos are fine for a 3.2 megapixel camera, but the indoor photos it snapped are pretty bad- extremely grainy and dark (even with the flash!). I really don't recommend this camera unless you only need it for outdoor use."
4,product verses management,"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE ITEM . BUT, THE PROBLEMS WERE ALL IN THE HANDLING AND MANAGEMENT. I WAS PROMISED A FEW THINGS IN THE PURCHASE AND REBATES BUT NOTHING ! I HAD TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE WHICH HAD NO CLUE WHAT I HAD ORDERED OR WHO I WAS. BUT I DID FIND SOMEONE IN THE COMPANY WHO HAD SOLD THE CAMERA AND SHE FOUND NO LINK TO THE TRANSACTION ! BUT SHE INVESTIGATED THRU THE AMAZON CREDIT CARD AND FOUND THAT I WAS IN THERE, THEREBY I WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THE CREDIT COMPANY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE AND STRAIGHTEN IT OUT AND GET THE ITEM PLUS THE REBATE THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD TO RE-PURCHASE. GLAD FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL DIG FOR THE CUSTOMER AND HELP. THE DELIVERY WAS DOUBLE THE TIME IT WAS TO BE."
2,Good but out of date,"This book is written well and explains the technology well, and is a good reference for the basic design and set-up. However, items mentioned as coming in the future are already standard. The HD TV and Home Theater technology is changing so fast it is hard to write, print and distribute a book and keep it current."
4,Home Theater for Dummies,This was a well written basics type book. Definitely good for someone who knows nothing about home theater.
2,Did not help me,This book was not what I thought. Most of it deals with what to purchase and how to set it up. I still have not been able to set my system up and will still have to call a pro.
2,Hard to understand,"Very complex book, lots of high vocabulary usage. Cannot understand the book so it is not worth to purchase unless you are an scholar!!"
1,Opteka a cheap Manfrotto clone?,"I ordered this Manfrotto bubble level through Amazon/47th Street Photo and was shipped a cheap looking copy made by Opteka. One bubble is huge, one tiny and it does not look as nicely made as a Manfrotto levels I've seen. It is going back for a refund. I'll get a real one at B&H Photo."
3,"Works well, but over-priced","The double bubble is useful for determining if you camera is really level. Most of the time I haven't found being perfectly level to be an issue, but having a double level is particularly useful if I'm getting ready to shoot a panoramic that I'll be stitching together. I have a single bubble level to determine if the base of the tripod head is level, but that doesn't tell me if the camera is level. When using a bubble on the tripod head base and a double bubble on the camera, I find I can quickly reposition the camera for the next shot.The price is the main reason to dock this level. There are others out there (such as the Flashpoint equivalent from Adorama) that function just as well and are cheaper. You won't regret owning this, but you may regret paying the extra money for the Manfrotto name."
4,Good level,For the money this is a great level. It is good to use when out in the country/wilds where you don't want to carry a lot of weighty equipment. Works good.
4,Does what it's suppose to,"Allows you to level your camera. I like the convenience of having it on the flash shoe, so it doesn't get in the way when you're not using it, but it's there when you need it. Fits snug into my Canon 30D.Only 4 stars (not 5) because paying this much for a piece of plastic kinda sucks, but I couldn't find one cheaper, so I had to bit the bullet, but I'm glad I did, so if you're looking for one, this works nicely."
3,Not really level,"To get straight to the point, one axis on my sample is significantly off level. I expected better from the Manfrotto name and for the premium price they ask."
3,cotton candy,"I'm surprised at the raves for this book. It is well produced. The photos are terrific. But: The building descriptions do little more than cheer-lead. He raves about features which are not illustrated. Most of the buildings only get 4 photos. The plans provided are far too small, usually only one plan is provided, though most of the buildings have more than one level. In at least one case the plans are mislabled. I'd only recommend this book to somebody who only wants a catalog of names. Still waiting for a really good book about mid-century modern architecture. This isn't it."
5,A Fun Tour of Rarely-Seen Gems,"I loved the stories behind each of these houses. I own several books on midcentury mod and this is the first that truly captures the modern aesthetic, from the book's design to the photography to the writing. Excellent!"
4,A Peek at many Architectural Rarities,"The author provides a good overview of the history and restoration of 35 architecturally significant housesof the 1930's through mid-century. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 star rating is it's small format,resulting in smallish pictures and smaller floor plans. These wonderful houses deserved a larger page size,say 12"" x 12"", to show them to the best advantage. Still, given it's relatively modest price, this book providesa lot of information between the covers."
4,Mid-Century Modern,"If you want a strong, national (not just LA or Palm Springs) overview of mid-century modern, this is a good bet. Very well produced, beautiful imagery."
2,Didn't like it so much...,"I was looking for mid-century houses that were more in the middle classes, and you do not get that here.These are all high-end, very expansive homes, similar to the type one might come across in Dwell magazine. The book is nicely set up, with thick, distinctive paper used, and the book coming encased in cellophane, implying 'you're getting something very sophisticated and special here...', something I neglected to pick up in reality [but again I was looking for something else]. I also did not like the contrived use of marketing (paper and cellophane wrap). Always a bad sign."
5,Amazing Book,Girl Goddess #9 is an amazing book.It captures many different modern teenage girl voices.Yeah Francesca!
4,Good stories,I read this book in one night. The stories were great. They were so different from what I normally read. After reading these stories I wanted to live in L.A. I reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys the different.
2,A little disappointing,"I'm a huge Francesca fan, but this book disappointed me a little. Some of the stories were decent but they are not her best. I would recommend reading this if you really enjoy her writing style and perhaps if you are 13-16 years old."
5,I would definately give this book to my daughters!,"I read this book about 6 months ago and still haven't found one that I like as much (not including the other Block books of course!)I related SO much to this book! She writes with such an open mind and heart. Her words are musical and make 100 pages seem like 10. I always had these same ideas in my head, but am not able to put them in words that would capture the meaning like she did. I felt as though she was backing up every opinion that I have. When I have a daughter and she is of ripe age I will difinately read this to her. It promotes a sense of acceptance for everyone. I love it and could read the stories over and over again. From laughing to crying, this book focused on every real and serious problem in a comical yet sensitive way. As you can see, I loved this book."
4,Shadow dancer,"Among contemporary Congolese musicians, Lokua Kanza stands out in a class of his own. In a BBC radio interview, he made it known that Papa Wemba inspired him. All at once, Papa Wemba's 'Emotions' came to mind. Lokuo's free-flowing multilingual melodies, coupled with a serious intonation of jazz, are so captivating that you hate to stop listening to them. With this sort of music, he will never look back."
1,Xbox 360 players run,The game is fun except the saving and freezing issues. Nothing like completing a quest line to log back on and start completely over. Not sure how it works on the Xbox but it stinks on the 360.
3,Good but way to short,"Fable is a very polished adventure RPG. The game has great graphics and gameplay as you would expect. My big problem with the game is it is simply to short. I have beaten this game three times since I got it four days ago. The game can be beaten in about six hours. Also the game is very very easy. I was dissapointed also at the lack of role playing elements in the game. Lack of charecter customization, and also the lack of content such as weapons and armor(There are no shields in this game!). It seems like again microsoft has dumbed down this game so it could be released sooner, which is also what they did with halo. My advice, don't buy this game rent it. You will easily be able to beat this game a couple times over one rental period. This game is fun but very short."
4,bitter sweet,"i was extremely excited when i got my brand new copy of Fable, mostly because gamestop doesnt carry xbox games anymore. it was in perfect condtion, no scratches, and the only dissappointment was that it doesnt work in xbox 360s so unless you have an original xbox dont buy it."
5,I love Fable!!!,This game was in perfect condition and works great! I'd recommend this game to EVERYONE!!! This is my favorite game!
4,It was worth getting even though i already had the original version of Fable.,"i already had the original version of fable, and i was scared to get ""the lost chapters"". ""maybe it won't have all the old goodness"" i said. ""it won't have enough extra stuff"" i said. if you already have fable then you can pass this version over but i strongly suggest trading that one away and picking this one up. i was also afraid they may have cut stuff out. which turned out not to be the case. they left all the goodness in and then added some. MMMMMMMMMMMMM GOODNESS. OR MMMMMMMMMMMMM BADNESS. either way you'll kick some serious butt or whatever they have. well enjoy the game i know i did. -VANRAZIEL"
4,"Great Game, BUT WAY TOO SHORT!!!","ok they promised so much in this game and didnt deliver.First off, they said that the game would cover the lifespan of 6-65 years old. This only applies if you stay in jail over and over until you are old. Battle scars? well i never got any.Hundreds of character possiblilites as far as looks, well not really. you can either have a bald head, short hair or medium hair. a beard or no beard and a very few small choices of mustache and goatee. The game is pain fully short and you will beat in within a week if youa re going slow.the armor types arent that different, there are only a few kinds of armor in the game and there is no advantage to any of them except Armor class. if you find a cool magicians robe, it will suck compared to plate armor and will offer NO advantage for a magic using character.It is a good game but come on, they promised all this freedom in the game and made us wait for it. It is worth buying but it WAS NOT EVERYTHING THEY CLAIMED IT WAS!"
3,"Fable is really fun, but is toooooo short.","Fable is really good for an RPG type of thing. But what I didn't like is that the game is really short, (you can finish the game at 8-10 hours), and there arent a lot of quests. But, the controls are fine, the gameplay is excellent, the fighting is cool (but a little repetitive), and the graphics are good. This is a very good game, but possibly the best rental game, considering it's shortness and when you get really bored of the game.I think the creators could have done a much much better job.ATTENTON!!!!!! FABLE: THE LOST CHAPTERS IS COMING OUT SEPTEMBER 20, 2005!!!!! EXPECT IT TO BE IN STORES ON THURSDAY OR ANY TIME THIS WEEK!!!"
3,An interesting game but not appropriate for kids under 18,"I bought this game knowing there would be a certain level of violence. What is not mentioned on the Amazon site, and was only known to me when I received the product is that there is also sexual content. I would urge Amazon (and all other web vendors) to have standard full disclosure of all rating information displayed on the game package. It may also prove useful if Amazon were to enhance the (customer) game review process by addition of check-boxes for various categorizations, e.g. age appropriate, level of violence, sexual content, etc., then allow search/sort on these values."
4,This is an awsome game,"I spent a number of hours playing this game. This game has much of what is currently found in World of Warcraft, as far as growing up and determining what kind of person you want to be. You can go around helping people to become a good hero or you can go around hurting people to become an evil hero. I found this very entertaining and would recommend to to anybody that has kids 13 years or older."
3,Good game but too short for an RPG,"Pros: Fun game to play, great story, beautiful scenery, enjoyable combat system, wide variety of ways to build your character, the notion of being good or evil, interesting quests that are not difficult to figure out, cool (albeit easy) boss fightsCons: way, WAY too short for an RPG...took me 12.5 hours to complete and I did all the optional side quests, maps/world are too simple/small, no real variety of enemies, limited *useful* weapons/armor, very poor enemy AI, the guildmaster talking to me all the timeSummary: The game has substance, but only 12 hours worth - I hope the sequel addresses this issue."
3,this game is terrible,"The graphics are outdated. Fighting feels weird. The game keeps getting gliches. lip sync,saving,loading are all messed up. Plus I bought the Lost Chapters version but ended up with the regular one. If you are gonna buy this buy it on a different site. The story is good and its an okay game."
5,Love it!!!,I bought this game used for only $9.99 and it is in great condition. If you enjoy role playing games that give you options of being good or evil this is the game for you. It's also very interactive. And even if you reach the end you are not done. You can continue on to better yourself or create more havic.Or just start over and choose the opposite path. It's addictive and just all around great fun.
3,Short but Sweet...,"This is one of those games that really has a ton of hype built up around it for years while it is being developed and then when it finally comes out people are disappointed. I kept my expectations relatively low so I had a good time with it while it lasted. Unfortunately I probably won't be playing it again unless I get very bored and decide to go the other route with the whole good/evil thing. It was fun overall although a few of the missions got on my nerves for repetiveness or just being boring. The story was pretty mediocre as well, but the games main flaw is its shallow length which brings its score down. I would recommend this to people if you are really into action/rpgs but I would wait until the price goes down or get it if its on sale like I did."
5,"Some let downs, but...","Ok, first of all this game was WAY TOO OVER-HYPED. However, FABLE IS STILL TOTALLY AWESOME! Yeah, it could have been a little deeper, but it's still very fun! Here's some highlights...GOOD:Superb graphicsDeep character developmentAwesome combat mechanicsTons of cool stuff to do in Albion... Total freedomLots of humorTotally addictiveMany crusty old RPG clichés are thrown outFantastic musical scoreBAD:Not enough enemy typesMain quest runs a bit shorter than most RPGsStory isn't the most interestingA few more spells wouldn't hurtThe UGLY:Some frame rate slowdown"
2,not my kind of game,"this game was a gift for someone else, i do not play these types of games at all. but the person it was for liked it."
2,Over-rated,"The game is decent, but nothing special. I finished it in 25 hours and spent a lot of time just messing around and wandering. I'm sure you could finish it in half that time if you tried. You are pretty much forced to follow the main storyline. You can do other things, but the real game is in the storyline. Easy to max out your characters abilities, and then experience is pretty much useless. Forget all they tell you about strategy. I easily beat it with a big hammer and a spell shield just running into battles. Not much to this game. Once you complete the main plotline, the game can continue, but there are no more quests to do. They end with the main storyline. Overall too much hype. The reviewers get paid by the ads for the games they are reviewing, obviously this conflict of interest needs to be taken into consideration."
2,A Fabled Disappointment,"Sadly, this game fell far short of my expectations. For starters, it was way too easy. I died twice in the entire game, and only becuase you get so many rez potions it doesn't matter. Also, the game took me 16 hours to clear, even after doing every quest and power leveling for a couple hours. As for the deep plot, and every action impacting your future...it was all a hoax. The main storyline was pretty boring, and you never felt like you were immersed in an epic adventure. As for my actions...the only thing that came out of me being mr. uber goodguy was that people would cheer for me as I walked by, or a couple guards would help fight with me on my quests. It was by no means an impressive game. I went to start a new game as an evil character, but after 10 minutes came up with the inevitable...why bother..."
2,not worth it.,"this is the most disappointing game i have ever played. we were led to be it was free form. its not. you want to see true free form, play morrowind. we were lead to believe that all of your actions were going to effect your good or evil. it does, but it is very poorly done.you want to see it done right? play knights of the old republic. beautiful graphics? okay graphics. hardly earth shattering. that would of been kingdom hearts when it came out what, 4 years ago. no major advancements here. nothing to offer in a game new. i would still rather play any of the games mentioned before. my copy was traded in for x-men legends. someday someone will be able to copy the freeform world and sheer number of quests of morrowwind, the story of kotor, the graphics of kingdom hearts, and make a rpg that is truly worthwhile."
2,"Great if you have Xbox, Ok if you have Xbox 360","If you have an old Xbox you wouldn't have any complaints with this game. However, if you have a newer Xbox 360. Best to have a 250GB memory and buy the game for $20.00USD from the Xbox live service, instead of trying to play off the actual game disc itself. If you are lucky to get it to even work (Xbox customer service is NO HELP!!!), it will glitch on you within a couple of hours...so save often. If you are smart and download from the Xbox live service, have fun and happy gaming."
3,Rent it.,"I agree with the most common observation that this games was way too short. I beat it in 9 hours albeit not digging to deeply. Also I only died once in the whole game (and that was only because I didn't drink one of my 100 health potions in time) and that was at the endgame boss. And apparently your character can't talk which lends to problems when a game is advertised as being able to choose your own path.Anyway, I had fun playing it but a day after beating it I've already forgotten about it and have no desire to replay the game as ""Evil"".I highly recommend renting it but not buying it. Oh and the music was awesome, I do remember that."
2,Wait for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for XBOX instead...,"What a waste of money...pretty graphics, but not as good as they should have been, and great music...stiff gameplay...more like the Sims really than a role playing action game...I enjoyed the good/evil choices much much more in Star Wars: KOTOR ....and I enjoyed the customization features in GTA:SA way way more than this lame duck!"
1,Sorry to say,"This game is alright I suggest getting Oblivoin for computer or xbox 360But if you must have this game you should pick up Fable the lost chapters wich does make the game better but normal fable sucks it finished the story in 8 hours even with side quest. Oh and for who think that after beating it you will get to play on are wrong, well mostly.After beating the game I find out that there is absolotly nothing to doSo If U realy want this game get the expantoin versoin wich has both games fable and the expantoin Because if you pick up this game.get ready to be dissapointed"
2,Embarrasing,"The developers and marketers of this game should be ashamed. I beat it in less than 16 hours with lots of messing around and buying thigns i didn't need. All the hype turned out to be just that, hype. Shame, shame, shame. Do not buy, rent this game, you can beat it in less than a week, I did."
2,Fable - Fun but short,"This is a fun game but it has 3 very big draw backs that if I had known about, I would have waiting to buy the game until the price dropped.1) Screen load times - Each screen you play on is very limited. If you want to walk from one part of the world to another, you will have to wait through half a dozen or more ""screen loading"" windows.2) The game is very short. I played all but one of the side quests and still finished the game in a few days, playing only a few hours a day.3) While you do have some fredom to move around. This game is basically played on rails."
2,wayyyyyyy toooo short,"I waited for this game for almost 7 months. FIrst it was supposed too come out in july, but it didn't. I thought the wait would be worth it, wrong. I played it for 10 hours and i'm on the last mission. Also the missions are so ez and boring. Ull never have to try more than once on most missions. Also there are no puzzles like zelda and when there r they take 2 seconds too solve. THis game really pissed me off because i thought that it would be almost as good as zelda, and that it would be my number 2 xbox game(halo 2 #1)Rent it, don't buy it"
4,Fable the Lost Chapters,I ordered this game because I loved playing the original Fable on the Xbox....I received my order in excellent time & condition! I recomend it to anyone who liked the original Fable!
3,satisfied,"The game was about what i expexted. But there are annoying little things all throughout, and being restricted by boundaries is the biggest reason i prefer the Elder Scrolls games. More customization options, both for characters and weapons..."
4,"Great game, lots to do!","I downloaded this on my Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live because I had some credits I had to use. I was hoping this game would be good and boy was I surprised. It is a really fun game. From the first time I started it and accidentatly farted on the game (first time I seen a game do this!) to becoming a full fledge hero everything about it was pretty amazing. I do highly recommend this game and relate it to the ""Zelda"" franchise but it's Microsofts version. I know it's NOT zelda, don't flame my review. But it does have similar characterisitcs. Definitly try it if you want to stay occupied and have some fun!"
3,a good rental,"I would recommend renting this game. It is a lot of fun for about a week. I got it because it was supposed to be a different game everytime you play. Not true at all. The quests are almost identical whether you are good or evil. The characters in each town are nearly identical and everyone will say the same things to you. It was a blast the first time around. A little too easy, but still entertaining and hard to turn off. I've played it for about an hour since beating it the first time, several months ago. I plan on trading it back in as soon as Forza comes out."
3,Very very short game!,"I could not believe how short this game was and how little variety of monsters there were! It took me about two and a half days to beat the game!!! That is with lunch, supper, telephone and snack breaks. The variety of armour and different things to do was poor to say the least. Save some money and rent this game. I keep wondering why this game took so long to build. It should have been called Fable: Act one; the quetion is where are the other three acts that should have been programed in? Watch the price on this game drop quick in the next little while."
3,Dated but fun,"My husband got this for me, after I'd already played Fable 2. It's a fun game but the graphics are dated & for a novice gamer like me, it was difficult to keep interested. If I had played it first I'm sure I would have loved it."
5,I love Fable...,"I bought the original Fable when it came out, and it quickly became one of my most re-played games. I was thrilled when TLC came out, with new content! My only problem with it is that I expected a lot more content early on in the game, instead of having to play a hour or so before getting to anything new. I am very pleased with the purchase."
2,NEVER GET THIS GAME,This game has the worst rating ever it should be E for all I care. The game is boring because you hardly get to fight the blood does not look real. The People look like their from years ago. Whatever you do don't get this game it's a waste of money.
1,Please know the difference,"If you are selling this game, please make sure it's The Lost Chapters and not the original Fable. I've tried to buy this game twice and got the original."
2,"Amazing Grpahics, Disappointing game overall","I was pretty stoked to try this game after reading all the hype on it. Just having finished it in under 10 hours, I'm disappointed. I'm sure the game would have lasted longer had I pursued all the minor quests, but some of them seemed too tedious. I was looking forward to another RPG similar in depth to KOTOR, or even Gladius, but Fable falls way short. I wish developers would put more effort into gameplay and overall graphics instead of lengthy and uninteractive cut scenes. The graphics were outstanding though.Good-GraphicsBad-Too short of a gameLong and frequent load timesToo many cut scenesLack of vertical camera adjustmentTedious and repetitive fight and action sequencesStupid character AI"
2,Dont Buy,"Okay where to start,hmm, ok this game was supposed to be you can do what you want,when you want and its supposed to be the best.Well its not.First your limited to some missions,some boring and others difficult,and you go through a mediocre story line that will literlly take you about 2 hours.This game doesnt introduce anything special to the RPG genre,so dont bother with it.If your looking for a good RPG i recommend Star Wars Knights of the Old Repuiblic,Morrowind,and KOTOR 2."
4,"Fable, It gets Good","Well, I personally think that Fable, a RPG, that is all about you choosing your path, after your town that you grew up in... burns down by bandits. This game is great, and it gets pretty good after awhile. You start to get the hang of it, and it is great if you like being evil, all though guards will come after you if you kill someone or injure in a secured poisition. If you are good, it is sort of boring. But the graphics are not all that great, but I know the Creators (Big Blue Box Studios, and Lionhead Studios) are mostly focusing on the gameplay, which I think is great for the first video-game that Big Blue Box has ever made. They are creating a great game, and there future looks good. The sound however, is pretty good, because sometimes in a bad situation, they will play a eery music sound. Overall, I reccommend this game for the Microsoft Xbox, so check it out Fable."
4,I expected better but it was still good,"It was a game, in which i expected better, but that I did not get. I got your average game with better than fair gameplay."
3,This is what i've been waiting for?,"Just like everyone else, I too was really excited about this game. But I am beginning to wonder why? This certainly doesn't live up to the hype. Sure its fun, sure its something different, but is it as legendary as they made it out to be? No. The voice acting sucks, there is no jumping method, and you can't do whatever you want. Sure you can attack villagers but 5 seconds later guards mysteriously appear to fine you... Um not realistic.. in real life you could run away. Don't get me wrong, this game is good, just not as golden as it was advertised as."
3,It's ok,I thought it was a mulit player game. My son gets bored with it quickly since he has to play by himself.
2,Promises unkept...,"For years the developers have been dropping information on Fable. From an evolving landscape that reacts to your every action, to unlimited freedom of choice in the decisions that will effect the game's outcome, to boundless secrets, and the promise of over 100 hours of game play. What we got was what XBOX RPGs are famous for, linear game environments, predictable character development, and a game that you can complete thoroughly in about 30 hours. If you weren't expecting Fable, the game is entertaining and full of action, beautiful to look at, and admittedly the Legend of Zelda for the XBOX. If you were, you are probably left feeling manipulated into buying a product that otherwise you may have rented and finished in a weekend."
2,Awful. Pure and simple.,This is the worst overly-hyped game I have ever played. The story? Weak. The gameplay? Sickeningly linear. The graphics? Curiously sub-par. (Nowhere NEAR Final Fantasy X....not even in the same league.) Combat? Boring. NPC Interaction? (The Sims is sadly more involving.) Steer clear folks. This is a dud.
1,This game BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i spent an hour on the arena quest and i got to the end and i couldnt finish it (because unlike those losers who brag about how good they are at Halo 2 multi-player, i have a job, a girlfriend, and a life) so i had to shut it off, now i have to start all over again because the save system stinks!!!! So this game is being traded for a game controller which i have to replace because i shattered the one i had when i slammed it into my X-box. Thanks a lot LIONDEAD STUDIOS!!!!"
4,Love this game to a certain part,"I enjoy playing this game until I get to a certain part of the game which than turns extremely boring, because I know how it ends and it's not going to change regardless of what I chose. Be really good, sanity maybe, or evil that you are the devil himself. Not much fun on that and what else is there left when you complete and found every single item available in the game to where your inventory has cool stuff but no one to try them on. Not a real challenging like some other RPGs. When you reach the Lost Chapters part of Fable and complete once and replay the entire game. You'll find yourself restart the entire game when you kill Jack of Blades the first time. I still love this game and recommend it to anyone."
5,Great freakin game!,"I love the crap outta this game! Though the visuals are a little dated now, it still plays just like it did back in the day. May be a little short by todays standards but who cares? It's a classic!"
5,Outstanding and new information--a must for every woman,"What an eye opener! Every woman I know worries about breast cancer, and I don't know one who even considers that they are at risk for heart disease which will kill many more. This book is both a wake up call and an amazingly empowering tool. If you are a woman you need this book. It is warm, wise and wonderful and your key to a long and heart disease-free life. If you already have heart problems you can learn how to help yourself. Dr. Sinatra not only has the finest medical credentials, he is an expert in both alternative medicine and the psychological solutions needed to complete the picture."
5,Finally,I have not completed the book yet but so far I am very happy. I feel like someone actually understands there is a difference between men and women when it comes to heart health. The information is very useful and presented in an easy to read format.
4,"A little spendy, but nicer than the cheaper options","I sprang for the Sigma over some of the other really cheap options like the Zeikos because of previous experiences with smaller Zeikos filters - they aren't coated in the same way this one is.The cheaper options always leave unwanted ghosting in many lighting situations, but I have noticed that this filter generally doesn't exhibit this issue. Also, when you hold the filter at an angle with a light reflecting off it, you can see that there is a coating that would look somewhat similar to what a pair of coated eyeglasses has, so there is definitively something cutting down the glare. The cheap options are barely more than a piece of clear plastic. Overall, for the price, I'm happy with it."
2,Have had to return 2 filters- very frustrated.,"I purchased this filter based on the great reviews and wanting a higher quality filter for my 50mm lens because I do photography sessions for families, etc. I have had to return the filter TWICE because it will not come clean. The first time the spots were there when I received the filter, the second time, I tried to clean the filter with an appropriate camera cloth, and the filter will not come clean. Very frustrated! At least I am able to be refunded through Amazon and not lose money."
5,Very nice,So far I have had no complains. This filter works well to reduce UV haze. It is multi-coated and it protects my lens.
5,great lens filter,"Great item, need to replace all my UV filter lens with multi coated lens. Shots have no aberrations or Ghosting thus far. I would recommend this item or any multi coated"
4,"Quality filter, lens hood won't work though. Great buy.",Really high quality filter. Reason for 4 star rating is that you cannot use a lens hood with the filter on (at least on the Canon 50mm 1.8). Appears to have excellent quality glass. I have only had it for a little less than a week but I know this is going to last quite a while. Glad I bought it as it will provide excellent protection for my lens.
5,Solid and no glare so far,"I've had this filter for about a week now and I haven't had the chance to use my camera very much in the past week, but when I have, there are no strange reflections or anything. It fits my nifty fifty lens snugly. I chose this filter over other brands because I saw reviews about the others ones creating a strange green reflection/light of some sort."
5,"Wow, the other reviewers weren't kidding...","Others have said when you first take this filter out of the box, the glass is so clear that the ring almost looks empty. I thought that was an exaggeration, but no. This glass is downright invisible. The construction quality also feels top-notch. To be honest, I haven't actually taken any photos with the filter in place, but I can't possibly imagine it will hinder them. I'll update this review if I discover otherwise."
2,Not really worth buying.,"Pros: It does do what it suppose to do. I've never used any UV Filters before so this is the first one I used and so far I think it does its job okay.It does look pretty nice.Cons: Its scratchable. I used a clean standart lens wiping cloth to wipe the small dust and it was still able to create small scratches on the glass. Thats pretty bad quality. I even wiped it carefully and gently and yet it was able to scratch the glass. It's not noticable unless you hold it to the light but that still means that its pretty bad quality glass. So for the high price which I don't believe a piece of cheap glass should be at, means negative stars.-1 star for just okay UV Filtering. Its not special or anything.-1 star for bad quality overall. Glass and frame.-1 star for price. I would have to buy a couple just in case one gets scratch up or damage."
1,Amazon misdirections to shopping wrong filter size,"I bought this 52 mm sigma filter along with the 55-300 nikon lens offered all together by amazon as ""Frequently Bought TogetherCustomers buy this item with Tiffen 52mm UV Protection Filter"". However to my disappointment the right diameter size should be 58mmm, later discovered when received the order.Misdiretions though !!!Zero stars to Amazon.com"
1,Do Not Buy,"this actually added flares that don't appear without a filter...i am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase, and have just ordered a Hoya UV filter within a day of receiving this..don't cheap out on a filter, this is a product in which the money is necessary to ensure quality, i've learned that"
3,Good except dirty and small scratch,"This UV filter is multi coated. Dont bother with non coated filters because they ruin your photos. My only complain about this filter was that it came dirty with lots of specs stuck on the glass. I cleaned it up but there is still one little dot left but since it was near the edge, I let it be. Didnt want to deal with returning it. Used it with my f1.8 35mm nikon lens.Edit: It looks like the Coating on the glass comes off very easily with cleaning. I changed my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because of this. I use this filter with a hood to protect my protection filter!"
5,UV lens.,This is a great product for the money. I use it every day. I expect to buy several more in the near future.
2,An uninspired look at small craft with a big punch.,"At first glance, the title of this book suggests it is a look at the navies of the world's smaller nations - but not so. It is a look at all smaller naval craft from throughout the world. The vessels are listed in alphabetical order by Type next to which is a note of the country or countries which operate that specific vessel.Too many ""?"" symbols (i.e. missing details) against the specifications for my liking and the book would be greatly improved by more photographs.Measuring 10 x 7 in (25 x 19 cm) and containing 160 pages, this book is over-priced at 20 in the UK.NM"
3,Princess Glitter Doll,I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. She loves it ! What else do I need to say.
3,Disappointed,"Another bland book from Ms. Rogers. This one, although set in exotic places, just doesn't have the excitement and larger-than-life characters of her earlier works. Guess there will never be another book like the Steve Morgan-Ginny Brandon series. This book was very predictable and about as unexciting as ice cream. Don't bother to waste your money on this mediocre book that could have been at least a 4-star had the characters been more fully developed."
4,JEWEL OF MY HEART BY ROSEMARY ROGERS,"THIS IS A GREAT NOVEL, SO MANY PLACES AND SO ADVENTUREOUS, A GREAT STORY AND INTERESTING AND THE ENDING IS A GOOD ONE! YA-HOO! ELLIE MILLING"
2,Totally inaccurate,"Some people have said that you can adjust the sensativity of this device, but I don't think mine has that option. Mine is waaay too sensative. Just while typing this out, it records me as having walked 32 steps. If you want to feel like you've accomplished something when you really haven't this is a great product.Also, I accidentally pulled out the peg, causing the alarm to go off, and thought I was going to go deaf. It seems like a dangerously loud noise.The only reason I gave this item two stars is that the distance function seems to be more accurate than the step function."
5,Excellent recording of unusual and entertaining music,"Thomas Bloch and his fellow musicians have made a real winner with this CD. The music is diverse and interesting and the performances are lovely.I am unfamiliar with some of the composers presented on this disc (Martinu and Messiaen are the most well known), but there are some very good pieces of music here - even though they might not be described as 'masterpieces'. Bernard Wilson's double concerto for ondes Martenot, piano, strings and percussion reminds me of Bartók's piano concertos.Some of the other pieces on this CD are works of pure fantasy. If you want to know what 9 ondes Martenot sound like when played together, Thomas Bloch's Wave Orchestra provides you with a delightful answer.The ondes Martenot is one of my favourite 20th century 'period instruments' and this disc is a wonderful introduction to this instrument."
2,Ondes Martenot not so well served!,"Aside from the slip-shod art (typical for Naxos), I can't find much positive to say about the performances. They come off as under-rehearsed (the OM is not an easy instrument to play), lacking any sort of passion or commitment.Cynthia Miller, the foremost exponent of the O M, would have come up with a performance to die for."
3,"The music is great, but Amazon needs to correct some things.","I would love to see a hard copy of the score for the song, ""Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life"" that Jeannette MacDonald and Nelson made so much their own in the movie ""Naughty Marietta"". The score is available in microfilm at some university libraries, which is why I have ventured to comment on this currently unavailable hard copy. It is playable on piano or by a full orchestra.However, I would like to see Amazon correct the title of this item. The title of the song, and of the musical (or operetta) that it was taken from, are correct, but the composer of the score is the well-known Victor Herbert. His name is not ""Herberts"", nor is it ""Victor"", nor are ""Victor"" and ""Herbert"" two different people who worked on the composition.If someone were looking for all the materials Amazon has relating to Victor Herbert compositions, this would not show up in the search, which would be a pity."
4,Works Well,"I purchased this torque wrench for rotating tires. So far I have used it on two vehicles, and it worked exactly as it is supposed to and gave me no problems.I looked at a lot of the clicker-type wrenches in this price range, but came to the conclusion that I would be better off with a higher-quality beam-type wrench that I could easily calibrate myself, rather than something of questionable accuracy.An issue with the warranty: the package the wrench comes in says lifetime warrenty, but the directions inside the package say it only has a one-year warranty.The only other thing I do not like about it is that it does not come with a storage case.A bonus, though: Mine was made in the United States"
4,Superman my hero,"It brings back fond memories. I still find it entertaining, even though I've gotten much older. He is still my hero. In a silly way I feel like a kid again watching Superman in action."
5,still as much fun to watch as when I was a kid.,"I love so many of the old Television shows from the 1950's & 1960's but for bringing back good ol' memories of yesteryear few shows can match up with George Reeves in ""The Adventures of Superman"".The second season continues to bring us more thrill packed episodes and in glorious black&white; like season one.DVD quality is good and extra's are fun to watch.George Reeves is so wonderful as SUPERMAN.Buy all six seasons. You'll be glad ya did."
4,Not as great as first season...,I received the second season set today.I still feel that season one was far superior to the succeeding seasons.I was wondering if anyone has watched PANIC IN THE SKY with the Noel Neill/Jack Larson commentary. (It is a special feature on disc 2).In the middle of the episode the disc malfunctions badly - Larson's voice over is all broken up and the picture reduces to slow motion and is also all broken up.I am contacting AMAZON about returning this box set for a replacement. I was wondering if this is a mass manufacturing defect or just happening on my disc.Any comments?
5,A Good Buy of Nostalgia,"I am old enough to remember when these were new shows. I've had the pleasure of introducing my 10-year-old to first, the serial, then the first season of AOS. Now, we've been able to share in viewing the second season, and it has not disappointed.George Reeves shows why he is the quintessential Superman. The episodes in season 2 really show the subtleties of his depth as an actor.The effects are dated, buy they don't take away from enjoying the episodes. Panic in the Sky is considered the best episode of the entire series. Watch this and you will see why.All in all, I thoroughly look forward to getting seasons 3-4 soon."
5,SUPERMAN: The Original Series,"There is nothing like the innocent, old, black and white version of this super hero's adventures. Of course there are no special effects, but the honor and dignity of this old champion shines through.If you were as fortunate as I was, growing up with this Superman, this will bring back memories of simpler times. Somewhat predictable, these episodes are fun and entertaining. Enjoy!"
5,The REAL Superman,"As a child of the 50's, there can only be one Superman. I purchased the entire series and couldn't be happier. Just watching them takes me to a fun place and the commentary from Jimmy and Lois is great."
5,Much better than expected,"These episodes have been digitally re mastered professionally and they are flawless. The quality is superb and they are better than I have ever seen them as a child. The episodes are timeless and you must keep in mind that for that era, this was great stuff. It can't compare with the flying effects nowadays. George Reeves is the charming force that makes it as he really is ""Superman"""
5,Great series!,TAOS was a great series and these DVD's were done wonderfully. I'm looking forward to the 3rd/4th Seasons. I'd also like to see the Adam West/Burt Ward Batman series out now!!! I'd also would like to see the cartoons named the New Adventures of Superman and the Batman/Superman Hour from 1968 as well as the Justice League of America from 1967!
5,Fun nostalgia,"Having grown up watching these as a kid, these old episodes are truly a reflection of a more ""innocent"" time. It is fun to watch them now and not only see the numerous ""bloopers"" but to chuckle at how an entire generation saw them in their day as the most realistic version of ""you will believe a man can fly."" Lot's of fun."
4,Nice Old Fashioned Musical!,"This is throw back to another era, but if you are a Shirley Booth enthusiast like myself, you will enjoy her renditions of the turn of the century songs, which in some cases remind me of the songs in High Button Shoes, only, of course that show was much better! I think there is a plus with the delightful African American actress and songstress, Mae Barnes and her renditions of Happy Habit, and Hang Up...quite comical and good!! Also Wilbur Evans is a standout in his numbers! Will never forget Shirley Booth as Hazel and whenever I hear her voice I think of that character she played on Television for so many years...for Shirley Booth completists there is also ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"", which was also a show of hers from the early fifties and is quite good...the music is a little more memorable from that show...Anyhow this is a good buy!"
3,Shirley Booth and an average Broadway offering,"BY THE BEAUTIFUL SEA is one of those Broadway shows that ran simply on the box-office value of its star - Shirley Booth. The score (by Arthur Schwartz and Dorothy Fields) isn't really exciting or memorable, and the storyline (about a colorful boardinghouse by the sea) was hackneyed even by 1954's standards. Shirley Booth was the sole reason why BEAUTIFUL SEA ran for a respectable 270 performances, earning Miss Booth a Tony nomination as well as a Donaldson Award. Miss Booth co-stars with Wilbur Evans (who played Emile opposite Mary Martin in the original London run of SOUTH PACFIC), Mae Barnes and Cameron Prud'homme.The show also marked the Broadway debut of talented actress Cathryn Damon who appeared in the dancing ensemble. Shirley Booth sings the charming ""Lottie Gibson Specialty"" and the score also includes ""Old Enough to Love"", ""Happy Habit"", ""More Love than Your Love"", ""Throw the Anchor Away"" and ""Good Time Charlie""."
4,An inspiring story,This is for me an inspiring story for all us that are imigrants in this country and I am sure she is not the only person the suffer all the pain of being a migrant child or being part of the migrant family in the United States. Elva trevino is a good example of success in the United States.
5,"A warm, vivid and human life story I have read.",This is a story of a Mexican immigrant - a story of rags to success
4,review for barefoot heart (MJ),"Barefoot Heart is a book that shows the life of a family of migrant farm workers. In some of the passages Elva describes the moment with such detail that make the reader feel inside the novel. Elva wanted to share with the readers how hard her life was, and what she did in the struggling moments. At the end of the book I felt lucky in some ways of my life because I didn't have to suffer the same hell she went through. Elva must have a huge gratitude feeling to her father because she mentioned her father almost in all the book."
5,Diversity Requirement,"I read this book as part of a college diversity class. After the first class, I found out that I had already fulfilled my diversity credit and didn't need the class, I kept the books. Barefoot Heart is one of those books that gives a glimpse of what migrant work is about. The author's experience is unique and she tells her story well. This was almost chosen as a book club pick, but it was decided to read another seeing as I'd already read this one multiple times!"
3,the storyteller,"i noticed this book because im in summer school and it was part of this packet that i hade to do. i read an excerpt titled,""the storyteller"" i thought it was ok i didnt really like it that much. i didnt really like it that much because its not the type of stories that i read."
2,Project,"I had to read a few pages of this story for a project. It was ok but the subject didn't interest me very much. It is a bit depressing. But I can say for people who love to read about others, you're in for a treat."
4,Barefoot Heat,"I only read an excerpt of Barefoot Heat, but really enjoyed the little I read. The authors accounts of Marielena's stories were fascinating. The author was so captured by the adventures she was taken on during those summer nights all the children gather together to be to transported to different world than their migrant workers lives."
3,School Required,"This book was alright I mainly read it for a school assignment. However, this books makes you realize, us ""Americans"" are so blessed to live in this great country."
5,FAVORITE STORY,Ilike reading the Barefoot Heart because it talks about a really story of a child growing up in a family of migrant farm workers.the book brings to life the day-to-day existance of people facing the obstacles of working in the field.Barefoot Heart is also about a story of the author who speaks other language beside English.She was the smartest one among her class mate.She had her bachlor's degree in theoretical mathematics and her master degree in computer science/engineering from Stanford University.
3,girl age of 15,I thought this book was very interesting and how iut told about the past and and how families earned a living. And how children had fun when they didn't have things that children today have.
4,Heartful story of migrant workers.,This is the true story of a migrant worker child and her family. Her child's eye view of their struggles seen now throught the lens of adulthood are poignant. Straight-forward and well-written.
4,Very Moving!,I teach a film history class and Saving Private Ryan is one of the films we watch and discuss. This collection of letters is very moving. The variety of reactions and emotions is very moving. The letters were impressive and they fit in well while teaching the film. If you teach a film class or plan to use Saving Private Ryan in the classroom I highly recommend this collection to supplement your teaching.
5,Moving,"I am very happy that AOL has allowed the publication of this book. This movie has brought the feelings of many people out, including my younger generation. It was great to see many responses in the book written by the youth, for it is in the youth that we can really change the future. I am proud to be in the book, and I hope that it gets some people thinking about how much was given to us by the men and women who fought in WWII."
5,"As a soldier, Hack is my hero","Hack told it like it is. We had a batallion commander like him a couple of years ago. If you read the Book ""Heavy Metal"" Then you would know who it is. In this book hack always had the soldiers by his side. Something officers in todays army dont have. He always knew how to work the system for the benefit of his men. Something today few officers or nco's are willing to do. As a soldier this is my leadership handbook. If civilians want to know how the army works today read this book. Eventhough this book is based on the 50', 60' and 70's I still find officers and nco's today doing what they did 30 to 40 years ago. Once you read this book your outlook on the Army will change. RIP Hack!"
2,Major disappointment,"I purchased this book because Scott Ambler was listed as a coauthor. What I received is a book that is uneven in editing and content, and next to worthless as a ""Practical Guide"". There are some areas in the book that are worthwhile, but on the whole this book is out of touch with contemporary practices in enterprise architecture and how to approach it.My advice is to avoid this book. A more realistic, realworld and practical approach to architecture can be found in ""IT Architecture Toolkit"" by Jane A. Carbone, ISBN 0131473794."
1,Just Plain Terrible,What a disjointed collection of material. Did they even talk about Enterprise Architecture? No! This was my first book about Enterprise Architecture and it was so confusing on how it was written. Terrible. Don't get this one.
1,You've got to be kidding me,"I picked this book up at a local bookstore and quickly returnedit. The fact that it is a ""collaboration"" between several authorscontributes to the disjointed flow between chapters. It is morelike a collection of small essays than a concise book on EA.You'd be better off finding another book on RUP (Rational UnifiedProcess). The treatment in this book is incomplete and will leavethe beginner confused. I found the editing to be substandard---butperhaps the editor had no experience with RUP and those issuesslid on by.You might want to find another source for RUP information.... Caveat emptor."
1,The title is misleading. The book is NOT a practical guide to Enterprise Architecture,"The title 'A Practical Guide to Enterprise Architecture' led me to expect a book that dealt with the processes, challenges and techniques for creating an ENTERPRISE architecture. It does not. The book is about various technology frameworks. The Contents lists Systems Architectures, Solution Architectures and Service Oriented Architectures but not Enterprise Architecture. Enterprise Architecture is skimmed over in the Preface. The book barely touches on Zachman and Spewak and Hill. It ignores FEAF, TEAF, TOGAF, PERA, C4ISR, the Clinger-Cohen Act and other ENTERPRISE stuff completely. Enough said. Whatever this book is, is it is NOT a practical guide to ENTERPRISE Architecture. The book may be of use to technical architects designing solution-frameworks to support an Enterprise Architecture."
1,Outdated,"In support of the heading, let's take a look at presented viewpoints. There is nothing besides famous 4+1 and a slight variation on the theme.EA leaped forward during last 5 years, leaving presented material far behind."
5,Enterprise Architecture,"Overall I was impressed with the quality of this book. The authors took a fresh look at enterprise architecture as traditionally practiced.I would only recommend this book if you are an experienced architect. If you don't have a few large-scale type projects under your belt, you won't think many of the suggestions are useful, applicable, or even necessary. If you do, though, reading this book will be well worth your time."
5,A Practical Guide to Enterprise Architecture (James McGovern),"To Whom It May Concern,I have purchased ""A Practical Guide to Enterprise Architecture"" for my class which has already started on the 01/05/2009, I have waited for this book because it is vital in my research, and I have yet to receive it. It is paid for, I would like to receive my book or I would like to be reimbursed, and if not, I will be very please to use other services.Thank you for reading this email, and thank you for your time.Sincerely,RoseA Practical Guide to Enterprise Architecture (Coad Series)"
2,Don't waste your time,"Very stereotypical and not worth the time. There are better books out there, even for chick lit."
1,Deeply superficial,This book--which someone gave me--is so shallow it's a wonder it can maintain a 3-dimensional presence on a bookshelf.
1,Don't waste your time,"I thought this book was awful. The main character, Christy, was superficial, unlikeable and pathetic. The plot started out okay, but kept getting sillier and sillier. Almost all of the characters were derived from stereotypes. Please don't waste your time on this book."
5,Same Answers to the Same Questions From Another Generation,"Handbook of Magazine Article Writing answers often sought-after questions, such as:- What do editors look for in your work?- Is a cover letter always essential?- Can you sell the exact same article a number of times within certain groups of publications?- And, How do you keep your readers reading?With 33 experts, including Don McKinney, James Morgan, Lois Duncan, John Brady, and Candy Schulman, this book proffers advice on everything from queries to the mechanics of writing an article. With so much talent packed into this 246-page book, the difficulty of publishing a newer edition is understandable. However, this book would benefit if it were brought into the age of the Internet.If you are looking for the basics on article writing, and want it only from the masters of manuscript, then the Handbook of Magazine Article Writing is for you!"
4,Lives up to its name!!,"I was very pleased with this book and constantly refer back to it for practical ideas and assistance. I expect a handbook to provide the nuts and bolts, or practical side, of writing and this book came through in that area. As a novice, I need a step by step guidance and found much of it here. It's defintely an important book on my shelf!"
4,Guidelines for Writing and Marketing Articles,"""Handbook of Magazine Article Writing"" is a compendium of writing and marketing magazine articles edited by Jean M Fredette for Writer's Digest.Highly recognized writers and editors contribute valuable information book in the areas of their expertise.Practical guidelines cover ""how to"" suggestions for everything from article types to query letters and ""under cover"" tips. Writing styles, sample articles, letters, and title suggestions are plentiful and practical and are found throughout the narratives.""Handbook of Magazine Article Writing"" is an important resource for the beginning writer as well as the advanced freelancer. Filled with writing principles, tips and guidelines for getting articles published."
3,Could be very helpful for some; it just wasn't for me,"This book is well written, although perhaps too academic in nature for my tastes. But I thought it would be more helpful to me for my situation than it was. I am 40 and expecting my first child early next year. I'm seeking information that will help me be appropriately supportive of my wife and a better father for my child. If I had known the book spent so much time comparing how fathers raised their second families with how they raised their older children I would not have bothered.Perhaps I'm just not in the target demographic for this book, and perhaps I will re-read it in a few years and get some insights that escaped me this time around. But I just didn't find it very helpful.I would recommend that men who are starting second families read this book, but those who have never been through a wife's pregnancy should look elsewhere."
1,Broken merchandise,"The service was excellent, I received it very quick. I wore it one time and the bottom broke off during the day. I would recommend the service of the company but not the product."
2,Good but not great,It is an expensive product and it did not work form me in terms of what promises. I acquire it because it says it will prevent my feet to slide on the shoes which it did not do. It is just an expensive regular insole.
1,"Pointless, really.","I ordered these for my wedding day, as I was to be wearing a pair of 6"" platform Jimmy Choos and knew I was in for a day of hell in the foot region.I practiced walking in the shoes for like a month and I had hoped these would at least assist in preventing/relieving the pain associated with torturous shoes - even if it was just a little bit. I did a lot of research and these seemed to be the most highly recommended for high heels.They made the shoes FAR less comfortable than they were without them. They lasted about 5 minutes in the shoes until I tore them out and threw them away. They were awkward to locate as well... (dug into the ball of the foot or were too far up on the heel).Ibuprofen was far more effective."
2,Complete but completely dull,"Half the time reading this book is like reading a dictionary. I think I must have read 100 sentences that begin with ""XXX can be defined as .... "". The authors do a complete coverage of the topics but in such a dull and routine way it is hard to keep your attention on the reading. On a plus side, there are about 40 case analyses that are pretty good, but of course they weren't written by the authors. Of course if you're like most people, your professor has chosen this book and you have to get it whether you like it or not."
3,"Prime Beef, but it is past its date","James Bovard writes excellently and keeps the readers attention, which is sometimes a challenge in a current affairs or political tome. The majority of the things covered in this book have morphed into uglier monsters in the closet, thus making this book dated sadly. When it was written Bovard was cutting edge and deserves kudos for saying things that were not popular with the mainstream media. All too much still is not popular with the mainstream media, or else George W. Bush would not be still president - rather he would have been impeached, or potentially being tried for war crimes at the World Court."
4,A good read for conservative,Bush prides himself being a conservative. I think all conservatives should read the book to find out how every single principle of conservatism has been broken. It is strange that Kerry is liberal but does not act like one but Bush is conservative but acts like a liberal
1,NOT AS HE SAYS,"i got this book from 15 days ago and i read the first 13 chapter and i didn't like any of it,because it's not informative and he's explain the sql as a program not like an RDBMS and he's telling you about the 10% of anything,i don't think that any beginner want to begin with this book,bad databse example and i advice you to get the professional SQL 2000 programming if you are a programmer want to learn SQL,but if you are a beginner get first the by example for SQL 2000,"
3,Programming?,"This is an excellent book for learning to install, configure and manage SQL Server. However, the the title is a little misleading. The empasis not programming but admin. The few programming examples included are so intermingled with the admin stuff that they are hard to follow. This book will quickly get you to the point that you can start programming, but you need another book to go beyond that point."
4,Covers all the bases for getting up and running with SQL2000,"Nice all around book for getting to know SQL. Covers all the bases. Basic database administration, inserting, updating, and deleting data, views, stored procedures, triggers and XML.My only complaint is that the grammar is a little rough in spots. On at least a handful of occasions I found myself trying to mentally rebuild a sentence due to words being left out or misplaced."
5,Excellent Dance Music,"As a ballroom and latin dance instructor, I have used this Latin CD more than any that I own. The Cha Cha's and Salsa's are of perfect tempo. The music is simply wonderful to listen to whether dancing or not."
5,Excellent****,"I first heard this CD when I started teaching 1st grade. My first graders loved this CD and asked me to play it for them..I fell in love with it too. Even my own children love the music. No matter what nationality you are, you will enjoy this CD."
1,Please Don't Waste Your TIme With this Set!,"I bought this mic set for our church sound system. Week 1: Both mics worked and sounded great, even better than our Shure wireless set. Week 2: One of the Mics started having issues. Week 3: one will work and one will not. Week 4: Both stopped working and never worked again. Week 5: Returned and Amazon gave me a full refund. So please don't waste your time with these, the quality is not what it should be!"
1,cruz juarez,"One of the microphones did not work, the signal is cut even with new battery, so it only works one of two microphones"
2,You get what you pay for.,These shipped quickly. Opened the package tested both mic's they where good to go. A week later did a reception only one mic worked beyond 5 feet. A week later the one mic that did work suddenly had an unbearable hiss. Long story short I bought differnt mics!
4,"For the money, great product","My kids use these to make their own music videos and sing karaoke, the set up is very easy and they work excellent. Just remember to shut off the Microphones or the batteries burn out."
5,Beautiful and functional,"I wanted a baking dish small enough to make dinner for two and still give good surface area for browning of toppings (I do love a good crust). This was a perfect choice. I'm happy with the price, the appearance and the sturdy usefulness of this dish. Its easy to clean as well."
4,Bound to Inspire,"This is not a ""How To"" book but a collection of various Oates essays (some new and some older) on the often daunting craft of writing and on the writer's life in general. It is wise, fun, and rich with examples on the trials, the joys, and the blessings of writing from a diverse assortment of classic and contemporary authors...with lots of food for thought. This inspiring rumination is sure to ignite the creative fires which makes it a great and appropriate gift for writers at any stage in their career."
4,A fantastic trip into Ms. Oates world,Joyce Carol Oates created a wonderful insight to her literary world. I'm a big fan of Ms. Oates and it was a special treat for me to read about her writing process and her love for the written word. Highly recommend.
1,More a self help book than a teaching tool.,"Joyce Carol Oates flounders in coming across with nothing more than another book turned out with the speed of a professional typist. She populates the book with sentences that go on and on and on. Is this just another way for writers to make money? After all that stuff about Amazon having authors write their own reviews coming out in the NY Times this week --- which happened while I was finishing this one --- I wonder if Ms. Oates was at it, since there are nothing but five stars on this site. I found little helpful in this book. It seemed Ms. Oates was writing more about herself. Maxims abound that belong on the Dr. Phil show. Give me a break. I actually bought this book based on Amazon customer reviews. Never again."
2,blah blah blah,"Joyce Carol Oates couldn't be more vague about the craft of writing. Why exactly do writers compose these crazy self-help manuals anyway? Writing is something that can never be taught. And maxims like ""explore your mind"" and ""discover your voice"" aren't really all that helpful anyway. Most great writers, Joyce Carol Oates included, are gifted people. They don't know how or why they write so well, they just do it. Trying to explain how they gather inspiration is a waste of time. Hemingway said that if you talk about your own writing then you will be tarnishing something sacred. And I agree with that sentiment. Stop trying to analyze your writing. Instead, just write, and be grateful that you can write. Becuase most of us can't. Talking about craft is stupid."
1,Waste Of Five Bucks,I could not believe the poor quality of this brush. It was made in the USA but not of the expected high quality of other USA made products I have purchased recently. A piece of wire and a few spongy looking strips add up to a waste of money. This loser came apart during first use. After throwing this piece of junk away I went to the Dollar Tree and for a single buck got a multi-purpose brush that looks like a Rolls Royce compared to this Perky Pet jalopy. I have been a Perky Pet fan but if this is what they are putting out these days I will become an ex-fan. If you have access to a Dollar Tree go get a brush that will do what this brush does and much more all for a single dollar.
1,Break too easily,These work well when new. But quickly disintegrate and are useless after a few uses. I find nylon brushes are the only things that work for any extended period of time.
1,do not waste your money,i bought this thinking it would be perfect to clean my hummingbird feeders.i liked the idea of the sponge head to get into smaller openings.it worked well the first time so i thought this is great.however during the second use the sponge fell apart.big waste of money.
2,A disaster,"A great idea and wonderful for cleaning hummingbird feeders. However, it fell apart the first time it was used and I was unable to fix it. I don't believe I would order it again."
2,NOT LASTING LONG LIKE THEY USED TO,I have been using these mops for cleaning the bird feeder for years and they usually last quite a bit longer. I don't know why they are falling apart very quickly and the mop sponge part does not feel sturdy at all like they used to. COME ON PERKY-PET start making a good product again!!!!!! If I remember right seems they used to be made out of actual sponge material instead of this foam garbage.
1,LIMITED CLEANING ABILITY,"This is advertised often as a non-scratching bird feeder cleaning mop. I like most Perky Pet products but this mop does not work for me as it was advertised. The clump of sponge strings are mounted at the end of a metal handle that will not fit into the Perky Pet 8oz pinch-waist bottle neck. The sponge strings bunch up at the bottom of the mop and do not fit through smaller bottle necks. Also, the metal that is at the sponge end WILL scratch anything it touches - it scratched a plastic bottle I used it on. I had to catalog order from a different manufacturer a long, narrow, soft-bristled brush to fit into my narrow neck feeder bottle. The mop doesn't fit into any of my feeder bases either. As for cleaning the feeder bases, I soak them in a bleach solution, then rinse well, and thoroughly air-dry."
5,PP 23T Bird Feeder Cleaning Mop terrific!,"I just received my Perky Pet 23T Bird Feeder Foam Cleaning Mop and after just one use love it. I was afraid that it wouldn't fit the less-than-1/2"" bottle opening, which is the inverted hummingbird feeder that's so well-known with 4 big red flowers around it, but the mop just went right on in. And the shape made cleaning that hard-to-clean bottle a breeze."
4,Five Stars When the Time is Right,"This CD left me cold at first. I would have given it a three. Ah, but under certain circumstances, I discovered it scored a solid five."
3,Does not match color of other off white JBL speekers,Does not match color of other off white JBL speekers
5,This just cries for jigs and reels,"Women of the World: Celtic II is quite an excellent CD, filled with techno mixed and modernized music of the Celtic peoples. This CD provides great examples of the wonderful music played by the Celts. Being part Scotts and English, I was quite interested in this style of music to begin with, and I am not dissapointed at all with this CD. I, however, don't recommend this CD to people who aren't fans of this style! If you don't like Celtic music to begin with, then I doubt you'll be interested in this, and the 30 second demos do this CD no justice. Natalie MacMaster's ""The Drunken Piper"", while as I could see had no piping in it, had excellent fiddling and is a great way to open up the CD. Over all, this CD totally deserves a 5/5, if not more!"
5,This is one of the best CDs I own!,"This CD is filled with many enchanting voices and is very Celtic. I thought that ""Black is the Color"" was very beautiful and touching.I would recomemd this CD to everyone (esspecily people of Celtic herritage)."
4,an emerald in the rough,"I basically only got this cd for ""The Drunken Piper"" which I heard on the UPN show ""Legacy"" (more on that later). After tracking it down and listening to all the rest of the songs, I was even happier that I found 11 great songs to go along with my favorite ""Drunken."" My only hesitation with the selections is that a lot are sung in gaelic- which isn't bad if you know gaelic- but kind of difficult to sing-along if you don't know it. I probably would've preferred more Irish (rather than Scotish) artists, but that's just me. Regardless of where they are from these women are great. Speaking of talented women, Loreena McKennitt is another artist (though not on this CD) that I tracked down from ""Legacy."" Her ""Mummer's Dance"" plays during the opening credits- and yet another well-worth-it CD. FYI- I don't know how many people watch UPN, but ""Legacy"" seems to be a hotbed of good Celtic music. Happy listening!"
2,Not for me,"Maybe it's too Scottish for me. These voices seemweak and uninteresting to me, compared to ConnieDover, who I love. I find the long musical repetitionstoo long, although I usually love that feature of Irishmusic. I liked 'Black is the Colour"", Ta Se Na La (though it's too long) and ""It Ain't Funny"" - love theinstrumental finish to that one. I find practically noneof the haunting or lilting beauty I expected."
5,"A beautiful display of female vocals, wrapped in celtic",Excellent tunes and excellent voices. It's been in my cd player for weeks.
1,One month and still no item,"I ordered two pair of Motorola radio earbuds on January 10, 2009 from Amazon.com. They in turn passed this order on to a company called ANTonline who said they shipped it on January 14, 2009 and gave me a tracking number. The tracking number is bogus. I called UPS and they have no idea where the package is. I have to date, February 10, 2009 not received the product. I have called ANTonline three times and they keep telling me I had to wait 21 days and that it is on it's way. I called again after 21 days and was told I have to wait another 7 days while they file a claim. I have no item and have not heard from them since. Your service is horrible. I will never buy another product thru Amazon.com"
1,Heavy Jewish slant,"I was disappointed when I got this book and found it to be nearly exclusively based on the Jewish religion. It is not for wiccans or pagans. Heavy Biblical quotings and Hebrew inscriptions make this a potentially good book for people looking for that angle. Like the subtitle says, ""A way to the unseen ever-present, almighty God."" Should not be listed under wiccan, magik, pagan books."
3,"Something you may think you already know, NOT!!!","After reading Gordon R. Wainwright's, BODY LANGUAGE, teach yourself, it's true what he states in the first sentence. ""In this book you will learn a language which everybody knows already."" But, Wainwright gives a more detailed explaination of the different areas in which a person can be read or how a person my feel just by the way he or she presents themselves through head movement, facial expression, posture, and most importantly, eye contact. Furthermore, Wainwright discusses how a person's body actions come into play when having contact with the public or within their work environment. This book was enjoyable to read if learning about others and yourself is what you are into. However, I did not like how the author kept reminding the reader what was forecoming in other chapters, he really over did it."
1,Written for third graders,"This book should have never been published. It is the most elementary and basic book about body language that includes no original insight or revelation about non-verbal communication. The third party research the writer performed was so perfunctory and basic that it provided little-to-no value. Two thumbs way, way down."
3,An indepth and interactive look at our unspoken langauge.,"Gordon Wainwright made the involved science of body language an easy to understand and interesting topic of his book. Each chapter gave full explaination of all facets of our unconscience method of communicating. I particularly enjoyed the simple field tests he suggested at the end of each chapter which enabled the reader to fully undrstand on a first hand baisis what impact our slightest body movements have on others perceptions of us. For anyone interested in discovering the seceret messages we transfer to eachother everyday, Gordon Wainwright's ""Body Language"" holds pricisly what they want."
4,Baby Sweets': A Novel,"This book was a great read! As always, Andrews is very descriptive when it comes to details which kept me very intrigued, I hated to take a break. He takes you from the beginning of Baby Sweets, working in the fields, to living in their old town with all the twists and turns of her life and why it came to be that way. He gives you all the emotions the sadness, happiness, hardships, fear, etc., whatever you can feel, you will feel it here. The best part of Andrews books is that they all intertwine some way, after reading other novels by him I see how he refers to characters in other story he's written. With these overlapping stories you get to know a little more about his characters. Another great book to add to my collection!"
4,Munch 2.0,"Munch in trouble? Never! Well, actually, always. This second book is as real as the first, and very cool. I like the fact that alchoholism and addiction are dealt with realisticly, and prostitution isn't given the warm and fuzzy treatment... so many people seem to think it's cool or something these days. And unlike some characters who've never done a bad thing in their lives, Munch has reason to be in cruddy situations. But she's trying, and working hard at it.So basicaly the same good stuff as the first, only a bit further along in the story."
3,Was looking for this toy to make a custom figure out of it.,This action had gotten hard to find in my area of the country. I needed the twitch figure to make a custom figure out of it. I wanted a TIN figure from the comic book series THE METAL MEN. This one looked like the right body type to sculpt the new figure over.
1,Almost a Bride,"I didn't like this movie at all. It was a real disappointment. Seemed nonsensical. It was not humorous, it was not plausible in my opinion, and it was certainly a waste of money."
1,not what i was hoping for,"Well, the material was funky. The white portion was some weird thick acrylic/poly and the black was super thin polyester. Ended up tossing it in the trash and called halloween off."
3,Wednesday Addams,Cheaply made and looks more like a pilgrim costume than Wednesday Addams. My niece wore it. Striped tights might have helped. The big collar and cuffs were distracting.
3,Not for the Hume novice,"I bought this book because I wanted a short, clear, well-written overview of Hume's philosophy. Unfortunately this book isn't what I expected.First, this isn't a general overview. The author goes into a great deal of detail on some points (such as Hume's theories of perception), while other major aspects of Hume's thought are totally ignored (such as his views of religion). And the prose is far from simple. Rather than simply describing Hume's arguments, the author engages and critiques the ideas at length. This is complicated stuff, and it takes quite a bit of effort to follow the arguments.If you want to know about Hume's major theories in great detail, you might be interested in this book. But if you just want an introduction to Hume, you should definitely look elsewhere."
3,Hume Under a Microscope,"Barry Stroud is a good writer, but ""Hume"" is not a successful book. Or, rather, it isn't a successful introduction to Hume. On the plus side, the book explains how Hume's philosophy fits into a naturalistic understanding of human beings, and isn't simply an exercise in radical skepticism. However, most of ""Hume"" consists of intricate, at times belabored, reconstructions and critiques of partricular Humean views on psychology, metaphysics, and ethics. Amazingly, there is no discussion of Hume's views on religion. Specialists will get a lot out of it, but beginners would be overwhelmed, if not intimidated, by the complexity of the argumentation. Recommended with reservations."
4,I love Desi too!,"Wow! What a life Senor Arnaz led. We all love Lucy, but the man who created the most popular sitcom ever often gets overlooked. His book is thorough and eye-opening. If you love Lucy you need to read this book to hear the other side of the story. Although I did not always like how he chose to deal with life, I came away from this book with an enormous respect for the work he did. He was a great musician, producer/director, and businessman. I also believe he loved Lucy to his dying day."
2,Book is good but didn't get product I asked for.,The book is a great book but I ordered a Hardcover I defiantly got a paper back. I paid quite a bit for this book I expect it to be what I have asked for...very disappointing.
1,"A review of ""A Book"" purchase from Amazon.com","I purchased this book expecting and paying for a ""new book"" at new book price. This was not the case. The book was a very poor copy of the orginal book. So poor that you could not see the photos with any clarity. The book came with no jacket and the print was poor. I would not purchase any more ""new books"" from Amazon if I was you as not worth the extra cost."
5,Loved it!!!,"This was the first product I had ever ordered through amazon and I have to say I was really impressed! I got this book super fast and in almost perfect condition considering how old it is! This is a must read for any Desi-Lucy fan. Now the whole book doesn't talk about their marriage but he does talk about it and his early life in cuba, coming to America and I Love Lucy! No complaints at all!"
3,Two early episodes-cast and series producershave yet to gel,"""Cygnus Alpha"" is a bit hoky, with bizarre characters. It is essential viewing for fans of the series as it is a continuation of episode 2- ""Space Fall."" The plot of ""Time Squad"" is similar to ones used in a number of sci-fi shows. It is interesting, but predictable. END"
4,A Candid Appraisal of CPR in America,"Of the roughly 400,000 ""sudden deaths"" in the United States each year, only about 1-3% of those undergoing CPR outside the hospital survive. This low figure of survival is accompanied by a high price tag, both economically and emotionally. Timmermans takes a candid look at CPR, exposing its myths and problematic areas, and I found his book historically well researched and balanced. I do have some reservations about some of the misleading statements he makes in chapter 5, especially his mistake of treating 'social inequality' as a synonym for 'unjust', accompanied by the false implication that social value affects survival during a hospital resuscitation effort. On the whole, however, he does a fine job and his extensive historical research and interviews with health care workers make this a fine book. It serves as an excellent antidote to the overly optimistic expectations generated by TV shows and CPR training courses."
5,Life saving experience.,"This was a very interesting and thought provoking book. The public's perception of CPR is that once the paramedics arrive, everything will be OK, but Timmermans shatters this myth. Depictions of resuscitation on shows such as 'ER' show success rates of 75%, when in reality success rates are as low as only 1%. Through observations and many interviews we are shown how health care workers regard the protocols and how resuscitations are actually carried out in real life. This book should be required reading for anyone who has taken a CPR course."
2,Take a Class,"While their are some ethical issues that do need discussion I really wonder if the authors if took a CPR class. After being a First Aid/CPR/AED Instructor for the American Red Cross since 1986 Ican tell you that in a CPR and on the test it plainly states the objective of CPR is circulate blood containing oxygen throughout the body, especially, to the vital organs to prevent permanant damage until advanced life saving care can be provided. It's a stop gap until EMS arrives. This book is much ado about nothing."
5,Good for large asian soup meals,"It is surprisingly difficult to find a large soup bowl appropriate for asian-style soup meals like pho, ramen, udon, and non-soup meals like bibimbop. These Dansk bowls have the right shape for soup with the vertical walls and stable wide base. Each bowl holds a little more than 64oz of fluid. The neutral white color allows you to see the natural color of your soup. Being microwaveable and dishwasher-safe adds necessary practicality."
4,"AW, IT'S BETTER THAN THAT!","I liked this much more than the other reviewers. I put off watching it for a long time because of the amnesia angle. It's such a tired premise. (Like multiple personality disorder, the kind of amnesia you see in these films rarely happens in real life. These films make it seem like a common occurance.) But when I finally watched THE CROOKED WAY, I was enchanted. For me, the visual aspects of film are more important than any other elements, like plot or dialogue. That's why I love Noir. And this film, visually, is just as noir as it gets. There are moments of stunning beauty, and some images that are the very essence of Noir iconography. This is, of course, due to John Alton's genius. I also found the story very engaging. I see that the dvd is now out of print. I hope someone like KINO takes this opportunity for a restoration. (The soundtrack is pretty hissy.) If you are a Noir fan, do not miss this film."
2,Noir boor,"Personally, as a child, the room I was staying with my mother was used in the film. My babysitter recalls that John Payne was a real snob. I am glad it is available though since it stirred childhood memories of crawling over cables and the remembering the brightness of the lights."
4,Great little Noir movie !!,This great Film Noir movie is a hidden gem and I am glad I got it !John Payne is the classic noir guy and wish he had made more !!
1,Not good,"I had mine for about a year, barely used, before it slowly got louder and louder. When I took it apart I noticed that it had plastic gears which were ground down to almost nothing. Now, when I see Aurora shredders, the words ""planned obsolescence"" run through my head. You might want to pass on these guys."
1,A waste of money,I bought one of these and it lasted barely a year. Just enough to be out of warranty. I used it infrequently for small shredding jobs such as credit card statements. Don't waste your money.
2,Good while it lasted (maybe 6 months),"I was very happy when I got this shredder. It wasn't very loud and it did a great job! About six months later, it just died. I mean, it made a lot of noise and would shred 1/4"" of the sheets and keep making noise but not take any more paper in.As I shook it a little, I could clearly hear that there was some loose part rattling in there. I thought that was due to me moving it from the old place, although I remember clearly that it still worked for a month or so after I moved.Now that I read the previous reviews, I understand what probably happened. With the gears made out of plastic, the loose piece would probably have become loose no matter what. I also feel cheated, as people say theirs lasted for a year, which is about twice as long as mine did! Unfortunately, due to my move, I lost the receipt, so I couldn't really try to get a replacement or refund. :("
2,Shredder,This machine has trouble shredding credit cards and more than 6 sheets of paper. If you have alot to sred this is not the machine for you.
1,Amazon verified purchase,1. The crosscut is very coarse that the printing can be read by people who will scrutinize the shredded paper. The identity can be stolen.2. The sound of the shredding is not very pleasing to the ears.3. I cannot just drop the paper to be shredded at the teeth of the shredded. It has to be precisely aimed to the opening of the shredder to start schredding.
3,"Shredder Okay, So Far, But Basket Not So Good",This shredder seems to shred okay but I haven't had it long enough to experience the problems some other reviewers had. The basket fills up too quickly and it's impossible to empty the basket without spilling shredded paper around. And you can't put a plastic bag in it because then the basket doesn't close and the machine doesn't work. Gonna give this to the Good Will and get a shredder that is better.
5,I loooooved this book!!,"I've tried several recipes on this book already and so far, everything is good. The books contains basic chinese recipes which is very easy to follow. Very good for biginners who wants to learn how to cook chinese food."
1,CRAP!!,"Don't bother buying this 3rd class ""book"". Not even for amateurs. Poor text, poor pictures, just poor all over!It's a brochure, not a book. Gee, it's so easy to get ripped off these days..."
4,Good starting point,"This book is very good for those who don't understand rechargeable and want a good starting point. It covers NiCd, NiMH, Lead Acid, and the Lithium Ion batteries quite well for the beginner."
3,"Good review material, but now dated","This is a good book for the basic review of battery technologies. I (as an engineer) would have preferred more chemical and technical details, but as the title suggests, it is pretty basic, and consequently easy to understand. The fundamental problem with this book is that battery technology is rapidly evolving, and much has changed since the book was written in 2001. Maybe a third edition is forthcoming?"
5,Batteries in a portable world,"As a person trying to start a small battery based business I found the information in the book quite helpful.It was a little advanced in some respects for some one of my knowledge level but I learned a lot in reading it. The author was clearly trying to promote Cadex products not a bad thing,but somewhat slanted in his employers direction."
3,"A good general book on battery, maybe a bit dated",I think it's a good basic reference book on batteries but the newest cell chemistries (Li-Po) are not covered.
4,We call it the Battery Bible,Very helpful overview of rechargable batteries used in everyday life. Valuable battery care advice
2,Where's the beef?,"First off, take all you know of Changeling and throw it out the door. This installment of the Dark Ages line has taken liberties and strays from original histories written in previous books. Perhaps it was an attempt to induct people into the new prefabricated, trendy and unimaginative WoD. Certainly it details the powers of the Fae in great detail, one of the few bonus parts of it. It makes sense that before the weight of disbelief crushes much of their power, that creatures of Fae had the capacity to rend mountains asunder. Ideally, this is a game that is held outside of the loop if you are a die hard Changeling fan. It can almost be said much the same for the Dark Ages line as well. Get it for ideas if anything, we amalgamate everything anyway...it makes the game better."
1,What's with Amazon?,"Amazon claimed that it had a copy of Dark Ages: Fae at retail price, half the price listed by some of it's competitors. I placed an order 4 months ago and the estimated arrival time had been March 18. After the long way, a few days before it's expected arrival I received and email saying that the item wouldn't be shipped. Both the books promoted by Amazon and their competitors all disappeared in the blink of an eye. I've received no explaination and won't be using Amazon anymore."
2,Looks nice but performs poorly,It has a terrible recepction once you are like 5 feet away from receiver the signal breaks and the voices are hard to understand. Looks very nice and price is ok but perfoms poorly.
3,"OK, but not the best","I purchased this for a bingo hall. The mic's are OK, but not the best quality. The mic's cut in and out all the time. You have to speak into the microphone forcefully or it will cut out."
1,It's ok,The unit worked but the boom mick did not pick up very well the rf led remained on on ch d and the company said send the whole unit back it worked ok the hand held b kept cutting in n out
1,Disappointing...,"I saw what was offered and the price tag and was duped like everybody else! 2 handheld and 2 lapels/headsets for under a 120 bucks! Too good to pass up! WRONG!I am a mobile DJ and have used this set for 3 weddings. Between low mic volume, signal dropouts, feedback, hissing, etc. I am finally done with trying to justify my purchase. I ordered a different brand of wireless mics and sending this in via the RMA Warranty process from Pyle Pro. I hope I can scrap this as a backup ""if all else fails"" unit. This has made me and my DJ company look bad on more than one occassion. Don't let your wallet make your decision over quality. You will regret it."
1,"Not ""pro"" audio ... Had to return","Though the idea is good, the microphones just don't work. The switches are bad, the cases are light. Of the four devices, 2 handheld microphones and 2 lapel microphones, only one actually worked.Pros: All four devices output to a single channel.Cons: No eq for each channel, microphone cases were very light, switches failed. Three of the four devices continually cut in and out. My proximity to the receiver didn't affect it, so it wasn't interference. Overall, just poorly built. A good idea, but poorly executed."
1,I AM DIsappointed It's Doesn't Have All The Components,"Just opened the box containing the microphone set. There are only two microphone inside. One handheld and one headset microphone; there is bag containing a cable of some sort and four (4) batteries; two (2) transmitters; one plug; two antennas; one set of instructions, registration form and the control panel/module. Now I have a performance on Tuesday. I have not taken anything out of it's wrappings nor have I pulugged anything up, but I need the other mircrophones; the headsets were to be for the background singers; I need the other microphones and while I am sure this is an oversight, I must say my last shipments through amazon have been disappointing. Can use please ship the two microphones quickly, I don't have time nor money to run out or wait to have a new system sent. Thanks you so very much, Sunyra E. Lewis @ LeSun Productions. 800.638.9825"
1,no use is a crap did not work ever,"Dear seller I write for the following reason I sold the computer equipment was found to be very poor quality to begin I came up with the connecting cable is damaged, ok well that I can pass but not only was that the equipment malfunctions signal never is bad to being near the truth that the equipment is useless and worst of all, since I never buy it worked well. And to make matters worse deviaje suit me and now I have to go with this device that does not serve the truth I hope your answer to solve this issue. Actually I feel cheated"
4,Be careful of User Error!,I was apprehensive to purchase this product after reading some of the reviews and vowed that I would send it back for a full refund at the first sign of trouble. I received it quickly and got to the testing. To my surprise this non costly system rocks! I had my wife walk outside in the backyard with the headset on while I stayed in the house and they worked just fine! So they worked through the walls and from at least 75 feet away! I think some of the reviews are based on user error. You have to make sure that the button on the power source is set at 110V (standard for most sockets) not 220V. If it's set on 220V you will get the feedback and the mics won't work or they will go in and out. The sound quality is not the best but what do you expect for the money you spend on it. It definitely gets the job done!
5,Great product and price,I'm not a big review person even though i like to read them before buying anything! But after recieving this product for a very important event for mother's day I'm super pleased with the product. I did follow the advise which saved me! another viewer said to switch the watts/voltage on the plug and that made it perfect! Sound is so clear! I'm so happy i could cry cause the shipping was super fast and i was nervous it wouldnt get here on time. My mom was recently diagnosed with cancer and i really wanted to do something extra special for her this mother's day so i really need these mics! and boy i tell you they are great! Dont hesitate to buy if you have a great PA system get it!
4,Good enough wireless mic system for the money,"My daughter bought this wireless mic system for her 20 year old boy friend. I ordered it on Amazon for her. Here is her boyfriend's direct report to me unmodified."" I use it for singing while playing my drums"".""The wireless headphones work great with no big boom in front of me while singing and drumming. If not careful jacking up volume too fast I get feedback. If careful OK. I like that the aux box has individual microphone plugs and another main plug for mixtures and PA system"". "" I like it."" From a 1 to 5 he rated it 4 starsMy view... My friend has a small recording studio in his house and he paid well over $1000 for his microphone. I got a CD from him and he sounds good. So you obviously can spend a lot more for a microphone. Nice to know that a good for fun wireless mic can be had for about $100"
2,Headset Mics distort easily.,"Headset Mics distort easily, which is the primary reason I bought the system. Don't even use it now, went hard wired with Shure SM58. Planning to buy a Shure wireless system soon."
1,JUNKIEST of ALL JUNKS,"I started DJing and was on a tight budget, presentation and packaging of this ""junk"" was impressive ( I guess that is what the 1 star is for)The signal comes and goes, static most of the time even with brand new batteries and the receiver is placed up and away from most interference. This is one type of product where amazon should allow zero stars. Even if someone would give this product to me for FREE, I would not take it."
1,constantly cuts out,"We use this in a nightclub. The receiver is under 30 foot away, and it constantly drops and cuts out. Very embarrassing when you are talking infront of a crowd of 400+ people."
3,ok within 30 feet,beyond 30 ft coverage is spotty. you get what you pay for and this was 1/10 of the cost of the known brands
4,Great for the money,"I had another wireless mic system from a different company prior to purchasing this one. The other mics that I had quit working after I put the batteries in reversed (+ to - and - to +). Now that I am aware, I have not put the batteries in incorrectly yet so I don't know if the mics with this Pyle system would have the same issue or not. The first thing I noticed is that the battery life seems much better on the Pyle unit. I can use rechargable batteries and they last for a full hour. I could only get 45 minutes at best out of the old mics. I also like the fact that the antennas are on the front of the unit which is where they should to be if you have it in a cabinet. In all the Pyle system meets my needs and is the best quality I have seen so far for the price."
4,An excellent introduction to Bernhard,"The version I read was in three parts and each part was like a whole so there was a fair bit of repetition. If that wasn't the case the book would get 5 stars as the man is clearly an inspired writer with an almost perfectly free intellect (much to the horror of Germans, Austrians, organised religions and the medical profession amongst others). Like JG Ballard he opens one's mind up to ideas that one would never have dared to dream of. Best of all, despite it all (his life was quite depressing due to growing up in Nazi Germany and contracting TB) he's very funny. Makes you feel that with humour you're safe from everything."
5,Perfectly remastered classic,I have to give this CD 5 stars since it provides americans the only chance to listen to the fine voice of Kenneth Spencer. It's worth buing the CD just for the one track he's singing.
4,Good product,"Fits the Volvo C70 hardtop really well. It is a bit tough to fit in the first time, but once you figure out how to bend it around the mirror it works well. I live in Texas and it kept my car and seats a much cooler temperature than the outdoors this summer. It's easy to roll up in between uses."
3,Dissapointment,"I'm disappointed. It is not what I expected. Aida is a great Opera with many choir sequences. In this film many choir arias are avoided. The opera is shortened. This DVD might be interesting for colectionars of old movies who likes opera, and nothing else."
2,Old and Odd,"This historic movie is in bad shape. Sonically it is 50's bad; visually it is not cleanly transfered; there are major cuts and disjoints. As an early attempt to present opera on film it is interesting. The double cast technique actors/singers is difficult at best. Sophia Loren is beautiful as Aida; and Tebaldi sings it well. However the whole effort doesn't come off very well.But if you want a historic recording and sample of how not to do opera on film -- this is it.Fing a good Aida on DVD is difficult. The best I have seen so far is the hard to fine EuroArts dvd of Aida from the Festival of St. Margarethen. The singers were unknown to me as well as the conductor, chorus, and orchestra. The set, performance, and singing are excellent to extraordinary. If you can find it buy it."
5,Wonderful Acting and Singing,"This film version of Aida features Sophia Loren at the outset of her career. Besides her stunning beauty, she is totally involved in the character, and her lypsyncing to Renata Tebaldi's voice is very accurate. Luciano della Marra as Radames has the right look, and the singing is dubbed by Giuseppe Campora. Lois Maxwell as Amneris delivers a fine portrayal, and is properly villainous, and convincingly vulnarable towards the end of the judgement scene. Ebe Stignani does the singing. Afro Poli, a reknowned baritone is a striking and powerful Amonasro. His singing is dubbed by the famous Gino Bechi. I'm surprised that Afro Poli does not do his own singing, even though I'm a big admirer of Bechi.The video quality is very good, although the colors appear to be on the bright side. I recommend this DVD highly."
2,"TOO ""RELIGIOUS"" FOR MY LIKING","I HAVE A STRONG BELIEF IN A HIGHER POWER BUT I WOULDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE REAL ""RELIGIOUS"". I PURCHASED THE BOOK SHORTLY AFTER THE PASSING OF MY FOUR YEAR OLD'S FATHER. THE PICTURES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND COLORFUL BUT THE CONSTANT REFERAL TO THE BIBLE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SHARE WITH MY SON. INSTEAD WE MAKE UP OUR OWN STORY. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK IF YOU STRONGLY BELIEVE IN JESUS, BUT IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM THIS BOOK."
3,Cost too much...,I got this book and the 10g when price is < 12. Good book for a beginner in Oracle. I just didn't see the 9i.
3,Good stuff but neuro-acupuncture?,"This book kicks... if you want a crash course in neurology and neuro-anatomy. The pictures and wording is great for those of us with just a rudimentary knowledge of axons and dendrites. As for acupuncture though, I didn't feel like the book had a quality tie in with the two subjects. It was almost like he threw in info on acupuncture just at the end and he only explained what some mechanisms COULD be. If you are gonna make a book on neuro-acupuncture, show the studies of what it does. They are out there you just gotta use them."
4,An extremely good introduction to the subject,"It is a book for those people, like myself, that know little on the subject but want to learn something about it.It contains short discussions on topics in a readable English for those of us that are not well versed in this subject together with some biographical details on famous philosophers."
2,HD quality is the only perk,"Geared for English-speaking tourists, this 30-minute DVD captures crisp images of Burgundy and the Loire but offers little historic or cultural depth. Quick pit stops in Beaune, Dijon, and Amboise leave little time to marvel at architectural interests. A crisp picture is the main perk of this film, and while it looks crystal clear on a computer screen, be aware that this disk will not function in home DVD players."
2,In what language is this book written??,Too complicated to understand. So I didn't learn anything. More normal down-to-earth language for the layperson would have been helpful. Picked up other books on acid/alkaline balance from the library which helped tremendously - so I learned about the 'secrets of an alkaline body' from other sources. This book was painful to (try to) read!
2,Poor sound quality,I purchased a pair of these to replace a pair of AudioSource LS62W I had mounted on my deck. The AudioSource speakers were half the cost of these and sound at least 50% better. These are very harsh on the high end and sorely lacking in the bass.
2,Poor sound quality,"Sound is not appropriate. These are sorely lacking any midrange contributing to a ""harsh"" presentation.Projection is wonderful. Bass response is wonderful when supplied adequate power."
2,They work...,"Speakers work fine despite having a stripped terminal on one. Sound is O.K. but I expected better with the size of these monsters. As far as the seller goes, these were offered as new in box. What arrived was a pair of speakers that were at minimum open box, most likely returned. Finger prints / smudges all over. Stripped terminal on one speaker. Fairly disappointed. They work though so not worth the trouble to return."
4,Great Speaker for the Price,I bought these speakers to for the outdoor reception at my duaghter's wedding. What can I say...they worked great. Really good sound quality at an affordable price.
1,Didn't last 1 day,These blew out the day I installed them. Other speakers I have bought have lasted 5+ years with the same tuner and music at louder volume levels. Turned the tuner up to between 50% & 75% and they both blew. 1oo Watts? I think not. All of the other speakers worked fine but being in the weather 24/7 they will not last more than about 5 years but not these. Spend a few bucks more and get a quality set of speakers.
3,Solid culture information,"Very well written by a master orchid gardener. His culture information is pretty solid, but their organization is based on a parent and then by its hybrids and that makes it a little hard to find the crosses. For example, you have to search all three before you find culture info for a Brassolaeliacattleya.Very stunning photography."
5,A bargain at twice the price--this book is a must have!,"This is a great book! It is full of factual information, grounded in real science and loaded with common sense. If you are fed up with the search for the ""magic bullet"" and ready to get serious about fitness this book is for you! This is NOT another best selling author promoting the latest fad. I was impressed with Ms. Greggains straightforward no nonsense approach to her topic and her honesty. While I was disappointed to learn that there really is no ""magic"" I was inspired by the authors belief in the power of good information to help people transform themselves. This book does the job quite nicely!"
4,Great phone,"This phone is small with an attractive design... It has all the features like quick dial, voice dial, calender, alarm etc..The battery life is excellent on this phone and so is the signal reception.."
1,i hate this phone!!!!!,i found it to be a pain!!! it has no reseption but that wasnt motorola's fault! but my phone broke all the time my seller got so mad he gave me a new phone!!!(for a price i recomend the sony ericsson t226 its the best phone you will find today fo a good price!!!!
1,Pyle 18 inch subwoofer,"This product is absolutely wicked. it hits hard, clean and reproduces sound excellently. i have no complaints yet and i am very happy with this purchase.edit: 1 week later the dust cap crackednext week: speakers sound awful and will not handle much powervery cheep"
1,"broke quick, bad voice coils","over heated under pressure. at nomial wattage. really, just a waste of money. i would not get them again. dont buy them they break easily."
1,don't waste money on this,"The first time I ran it at high volume it fried, total piece of junk!I would not recommend this brand to anyone."
4,Early 1950's Zoot,"I guess the Vogue studios had some problems. Like not enough mikes and no real producers. It's not like this was the 1930's! Thankfully, Zoot always had a good mike on him - and this is why we're here, huh? To me the 1953 cuts with the addition of guitar and trombone are more interesting - and certainly show more rehearsal and maybe even arrangements. Look - Zoot is always great, a real swinger, impeccable rhythm, inventive improvisations. But this one (while quite satisfying) is mainly for hard core Zoot junkies like me really. There are better small group Zoot Sims albums available for the casual listener."
5,Love it!,"My 14 month old son loves this show!! Bubble Guppies is one of the only shows he will actually watch, and my 4 year old enjoys it too. I bought this for a 15 hour car trip, since they have to watch the same show on the their DVD players and they both enjoy this one. Can't wait for more DVD releases from the Bubble Guppies!"
3,Love the Guppies but this is disappointing,"My son absolutely loves Bubble Guppies, and I like it too. It is extremely colorful and the songs are so cute! I am extremely disappointed in this dvd. For the price, I certainly wasn't expecting two seasons (or even one) but I expected something like the other Nickelodeon dvd's at this price point...6-8 episodes. I can't believe I only got 2 episodes, and the movie that they show quite frequently on tv. (The only good part of the movie is Wanda Sykes voicing the witch) It is just not as cute as the regular shows. I feel like I got ripped off. They should have marketed this as the movie with extra features, instead of making it seem like it was a compilation of episodes."
2,Disappointing and misleading,"My son loves the Bubble Guppies. Part of this was my fault. Even though the DVD never actually said season 1 or 2, or anything of that nature, I shouldn't have assumed that that is in fact what it would cover. Instead, a very sorry movie is on it with two television episodes. Please read all of the information before ordering this DVD. If you want the movie, then by all means, purchase the DVD but if you wanted the episodes, and more than just two and some karaoke mess at the end, then I'd advise against this. I hope that they come out with an actual season episode DVD because this was a waste of money. He isn't even watching it. He couldn't stand the movie when it came on air and nothing has changed and quite frankly, the movie doesn't have the same 'magic' as the episodes. It is different, noticeably so."
3,Much anticipated and left disappointed,"Basically, I agree with what other reviewers have stated. I was so excited to finally see a BG DVD being released, that I preordered it for my daughter. Finally got it in the mail and was very unhappy to see it was only 2 episodes and the movie- along with some karaoke songs. I hope they actually come out with a seasons DVD, because the episodes that I was hoping were on this, were not. I felt the item description on here was rather misleading."
4,My 2yo Son LOVEs this!,He loves the colorful characters and has even begun to sing along (as have I!). I like how they teach math skills along with singing and specific topics that hold his little interest! :)
3,NOT A DVD!,"My daughter loves Bubble Guppies and so does my whole family, I mean we all know the songs by heart. The only thing that a real disappointment is that this is NOT A DVD! I really wanted to buy her the season 1 dvd fro x-mas but I have not found it yet. Her room has regular TV with a DVD and VCR player, were old fashioned, I don't think my kid needs a kindle fire or a x-box in her room so she can watch a movie to go to sleep to or play in her room. I would really like to see an actual DVD come out please!!!!!~Tami~"
4,like it,"My son just loves the Bubble Guppies. Not only is it interesting, it has some educational parts that kids learn during fun watching"
5,son loves it!,Bubble guppies needs more products!! My son loves the dvds n books! This dvd has more than we were expecting! Its great!
2,Not what I expected,"I too, thought I was getting more than 2 episodes. My daughter loves this show, but doesn't really care for the movie. So I have to play the only 2 episodes over and over again on long drives!! I should've looked into it a little more before purchasing I guess! Bummer!"
2,Not for the younger fans,"I purchased this video for my 16 month old Bubble Guppie fan on my Kindle Fire. It was the ONLY BG video that we had not seen on Nick Jr. After watching just a small portion of it I realized that it didn't interest my son as I think he is too young to understand the concept of Halloween, but I also felt that the video was not appropriate for his age. The video takes scary a little too far and is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Thriller video. It's probably fine for older fans, but my son gets scared by the ""Call a Clambulance"" episode when the big blue fish says Aaahhh!"
1,In the trash!,"I ordered this for my granddaughter as she loves watching Bubble Guppies on TV. After watching it only two times, it wouldn't work anymore. A big waste of $$."
1,never was able to get this for my kids,wont download what a shame and custermer service give you the run around what a jip to waist money made my kids cry
5,Best Kiddie Show,My 2 year old started watching this a few months ago and she still can't get enough. It's one of the few (if any) kiddie shows that is much easier for adults to tolerate.
3,dissapointed,"I must also say i am too dissapointed that it wasn't the full first season and yes they should have specified that it was the movie with a couple bonus episodes. I was looking forward to an entire season when i opened it up and put the dvd in for my daughter who has been asking for ""bones inside"" i went to episode selection and on a few things came up. Its still a cute dvd but i would have liked to have the entire first season. If i had seen a description saying what was actually on it i probably wouldn't have bought it... But my daughter does love the show!"
3,"My son love it, But i am dissappointed.",Wasnt expecting only 2 episodes and a movie. I was expecting season 1. Why even release a dvd with only this?? doesnt make sence to me. I think buying it off amazon was misleading too. Didnt tell in any kind of description what the dvd had on it. Although my son still loves it... I probably wouldnt have bought it had i known it wasnt season 1 and only 2 episodes.
1,This Blows!,"I was expecting the Bubbles Guppies to release a DVD with the complete season, and this isn't it. It seems the only way to get the complete season is to use Video On Demand, but I can't even do that because I need it in DVD form for long car rides.When will the complete seasons become available on DVD?"
2,Bubble Guppies,"I put only 2 stars because I never purchased this episode. However, I think my niece or my nephew did when they were using my Kindle Fire. Also, because I have never seen them watch this show or this episode not even once."
5,Kids love it,"My 4 and 3 year olds absolutely love this show. I've only downloaded the one episode (Big Bad Wolf), but they've watched it over and over. The music is actually pretty good - it's not driving me crazy, which is a plus."
1,Not happy with the Amazon delivery system for viewing,Awkward interface from Amazon Unbox. Was unable to put the file onto a portable drive and transfer to a dvd or phone. I won't be ordering anymore digital things like this from Amazon unless they change the delivery method. The Bubble Guppies are awesome though!
1,Didn't get what I paid for,"I bought this DVD expecting the first season like they offer on iTunes, however I put it in to pay for my 11 month old daughter and I find out that it only had 3 episodes on it! I would have rather just bought the season on iTunes because to get the free shipping with amazon prime you have to spend $25 and the iTunes COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is only $24! And I would have had them instantly because amazon also failed to ship them until two days after the order saying there was a hold on my account and I was not notified that the items had a problem with shipment."
2,Not great,"This shoe is pretty disappointing. It is not as cute as it looks in the picture (the toe of the shoe is much more square), and it has absolutely no support and the toe box pinches your toes. I would not recommend this shoe."
4,Liked the patent leather cream ones better,"I absolutely love my patent leather cream-colored Jessica Simpson flats and wear them all the time. There was no ""breaking in"" period and for a person like me with narrow feet, flats are usually impossible. I was super excited for the black ones, especially given all the wonderful reviews. Unfortunately, they're not as perfect as the cream ones. They aren't as stiff in the back so they drag across my ankles and cause slight irritation. They seem to fit a bit smaller in the toes, too. Overall, though, they're not bad and if I had only bought them I would probably love them, but when compared against my other JS flats, they're just not five stars.My biggest suggestion is to not rely on ""same style, same fit"" mentality. You may not get what you hope for."
4,Cute But Narrow,"These are very cute shoes, but they do run narrow. They took some breaking-in and aren't ideal for days when you'll be walking a lot, but for the office or a movie date they are perfect. Very attractive and well-made."
3,Good Basic Flat,"This is a good flat shoe. I have them in three colors. The fit is true to size. The only issue is that they are fairly thin on the bottom, and thus wear out quickly."
5,Jessica Simpson Women's Leve Balley Flat,"The shoes are very comfortable. I discovered them when I bought a dress pair in a department store and then started looking on line for some more of the Leve Ballet Flat. However, I've been unable to find any more in my size. I would like the Cherry red ones. So I'll keep on looking. I would recommend them definitely."
4,Pretty,These ballet flats are very cute! They are very comfy! Jessica Simpson has a good eye for style and the price was very affordable.
1,Cute.... PAINFUL,I've never bled like I did with these shoes. I commute to work which consists of taking 2 trains to the city everyday. After about 15 minutes of walking I limped into the closest drug store to buy a box of band-aids to cover the cuts on both my feet. Never in my life have I ever experienced pain like that before with FLATS of all shoes. I immediately returned them that evening when I got home. Luckily I had an extra pair of shoes at work but the damage to my feet was done already. NEVER AGAIN will I buy her shoes.
1,bought these forever ago...,"I ordered them in black, and they came in thus ugly blue and cream color. I have to wear black shoes at work. So of course I tried exchanging them, got told that I have to get a refund and purchase the black ones...ok.so someone was supposed to come and pick them up and I was supposed to get a refund. No one ever came and got them, do I'm stuck with some ugly shoes that I will never wear. I'm NEVER ordering shoes from Amazon again. Also, I prefer to speak to someone on the phone that speaks English, not Indian English. I can't understand those people. VERY disappointed in the shoes and even more so in the service I got."
5,"Love these shoes, not poor quality!","I totally disagree with anyone saying these shoes are poor quality. I have had these for almost two years and just now I am starting to see some wear. They are SO comfortable! They are flexible and I never get blisters when wearing them. One thing I love about them is the toe where there is the suede-like material... it keeps you from scuffing the toe which always seems to happen in these types of shoes. I will be buying these in another color for sure. Great shoes, and true to size."
3,Great Shots but Publication lacks Quality,"Thought the photos were great and caught the Pug personality in outlandish and funny, digitally enhanced scenarios.Was disappointed with the size of the publication and the production quality.Although I was aware that the publication was a paperback, I expected more of a coffee book size and quality."
1,Not worth they money,Very cute and bright pictures but this is really not worth the price. It's very slim - as the other reviewer stated. As soon as I got it I sent it right back...it's about the thickness of a preschooler's book. I'd only buy it again if it were under $7 - and I'm not especially cheap! Lots of other great dog/pug books out there that are worth the money.
1,So I love Pugs more than anything . . . and can't resist a Pug Book,"but I sure wish I would have resisted this one. It cost me $20.00 and while the pictures are so cute, I have gotten books for my kids at the dollar store with more pages to it than this one.I was really taken aback by what you get for your $20. I am returning the book for a refund. The book is paperback, maybe 6"" x 6"" with 15 doble sided pages of photos. I would maybe pay $3.00 for it . . ."
2,Disappointed,"Its a beautiful book, but light on content. 20 pages maybe,21.00 for a small paperback is very expensive."
3,Great Premise But Feels Unfinished,"I have just started reading The Hunger Games and was immediately struck by the fact that the world depicted in that book is very similar to the walled city world described in John Christopher's Wild Jack. I am a fan of Christopher's work and found that this book was typical of his other work. It features a dystopian future world in which a civilized upper class lives in the safety of walled cities, kept safe by a totalitarian regime. The book centers on a young male protagonist who finds himself caught in the web of that totalitarian society and looking towards the ""frightening"" nature of the wilderness in order to escape.There is an unfortunately tendency of this author to leave books hanging a little bit. I think this is because he often was setting things up for sequels. Unfortunately, there is no sequel to this book, so as much as the world and concept is quite captivating it is a slightly disappointing reading experience."
1,Poor Fit,These wind guards don't fit well and squeak when the window is up. And they don't fit in the window tight so they move around alot.
3,"Very cute, very uncomfy","Probably the sexiest shoe I own. I love how they look with dresses and with jeans. Extremely versatile.However, they're very hard and inflexible and somewhat difficult to walk in. They're great if I'm going to be sitting at a desk all day, but I'd rather be out showing them off. Unfortunately, walking in them just hurts too much."
1,I woud give this video zero stars but they won't let me!,"I warn you to stay away from this video. I is really bad! For true Leo fans this is not something you should buy or rent but if you received it as gift- SELL SELL SELL! ok, well all this video contains is interviews with random people talking about Leo. There is no real footage of Leo which is probably why you wanted to see this. There is no point to this film except to bore you with other people's opinions."
1,I do not recommend this video - It just plain sucked.,This video has no interviews or moving video of Leonardo DiCaprio. It only has interviews of a bunch of weirdos and shows still pictures floating across the screen. It really sucked - not worth your money. END
3,Ah for the old days....,"If you ever wanted to see Deathlands do Aliens or Predator, this is your book. It's interesting enough, but doesn't hold a candle to Vengeance Trail, but it is better than Black Harvest. I long for the old days of Deathlands. Cutting Audio (maker of full cast audios of most all of Gold Eagle's books with special sound effects etc.) already have this one out and honestly it goes better as an audio with music and special effects. If you really want to experience Deathlands at its best, Cutting Audio are doing all of the Deathlands tittles starting at Pilgrimage to Hell."
5,Old school,"Alan Philipson nails the old school DL ambiance one more time. We're talking ironic, sick, twisted, with a major dose of bleek. This is not your put on a smiley face kind of adventure book. Everything looks bad, gets worse, and somehow, someway the heroes escape with their lives and all their fingers and toes.I heard from a friend in publishing supposedly there's going to be a website for this author soon. OfficialAlanPhilipson. It's supposed to give away free newsletters with q and a from readers, and inside dope on his books and the writing business. Apparently, this guy published more than 120 books under a bunch of psuedonyms. When he was doing the SOBs series, Warren Murphy, author of the Destroyer series, said he was ""simply the best and gutsiest action writer around today."" Rumor in the industry is he ain't with us no more. Apparently he got shot dead while working graveyard shift in a convenience store in Nevada. Maybe GE is publishing DL books he already wrote posthumorously?BW"
4,Not a shaver,"If you want this for shaving, it doesn't shave close enough. It does do decent trimming beards and mustashes though. But as a little set of hair clippers, it does a good job."
5,Made in the USA,"I can't say anything about the craftmanship of the product because I purchased it as a gift but it was for my 80 year old grandfather who will only use things ""Made in America"". He hasn't complained about it so I'm assuming all is well."
4,Does what it claims...,I've had this shaver for several weeks now and although it doesn't get as close as other shavers I've had it also doesn't leave me with a cluster of shaving bumps. I need an extremely close shave for my job and this is adequate but I do wish it got just a little closer. As for the noise it is no louder than my hair clippers or any other shaver I've had in the past. I've always preferred wahl products and plan to buy another model to see if I can get a little closer.
2,Save your money,Get the Wahl 8900. You can thank me later. These trimmers do not last or cut as good as the 8900. The battery flat out sucks. Spend the few extra bucks for the 8900. I promise you will be happy you did.
1,Rusts,"Decent trimmer, not very good for stubble, but there is one major problem: you can't wash it. It'll get all rusty."
4,Wahl 9940-600 Metro Bump,"It doesn't shave close enough if you want this mainly for shaving, but it does do decent trimming of beard and mustache and battery life is great."
1,Product works but needs more trimmer lengths,"I'm a frequent buyer on Amazon but rarely leave reviews. I purchased this shaver based mostly on its positive reviews. While it does work well, it only comes with three shave lengths, all of them very short. I use my razor primarily for maintenance, keeping my sideburns a reasonable thickness, etc... The the lengths provided are all extremely short (3/16th"" being the longest). That would be fine if there were a way to purchase longer lengths, but I'm unable to find longer lengths offered for sale. So basically this is useless to me seeing as they only offer short shave lengths that don't work for me. My fault for not being more cautious in my purchase, but you'd think they'd offer other lengths for purchase as well."
4,Shultz is coming,What can you say about a great tv series from the 60's. Everything when I want it without having to get up early in the morning to watch episodes on HDNET.
5,They just don't make em' like this anymore,"DVDs same in a typical DVD storage case for multiple disks, All the shows are In color (And they were proud if it!). Good quality especially for ths timeframe. The show - one if my favorites as well as my 20 year old son! We'll sit and laugh for hours"
5,Get the compleate set first it is cheaper,I was going to get the full set as a set of 6 seasons at first but saw prices of around $129 I then let a few months pas and my wife had a 20% off at Target and I got 4 seasons one at a time there for about $14 each with the 20% off. But then as I was buying these last two I saw that the pack set all 6 was now for Sale for $69. ooops OH well it is a fun very enjoyable blast from the past and THEY ARE VERY WELL CLEANED UP!
5,Hogan's Heroes - The Complete 5th Season,One of the best TV series ever put out. Too bad it only lasted 6 seasons.CBS blew it when they canceled the show.Get the DVDs.
2,Too implausible and unrealistic in year 5.... poor direction...,Have to agree with the other 2 star person- it was going downhill. Poor direction and very implausible ideas even for HH standards. Episode 1 year 5 - Hogan directs a propaganda film!!! Just too much of a stretch. The previous years were more realistic so you could believe in the comedy. It's almost like the POWS had free run of the camp whereas in previous years they had to work more and finagle more to achieve their schemes. To me the main comedy potential of HH is how the POWS improvise and negotiate to improve their conditions; even the smallest conditions. Year 5 it is almost as though they have as much power as the Nazis.I have not seen year 4 and hoping it is better. Borders only had year 5 so that is why I bought it. Years 1-3 are priceless of course. Now I understand why it was canceled after 6 years. Sad but I am a huge HH fan.Al
2,Going downhill.....,"2 stars may seem a bit harsh, but that's partially to offset all the ridiculous 5 star ratings here.Come on folks! If you're an honest fan of HH, you've got to admit that the quality of the writing is noticeably deteriorating by this point in the series and that much of the cast (usually the Heroes) seem to frequently be 'mailing it in'.Seasons 1-3 were Hogan's best, but there are still moments to enjoy here. Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink), John Banner (Sgt. Schultz) and Howard Caine (Maj. Wolfgang Hochstetter) seem to be oblivious that the scripts are getting poorer and that series' end is in sight. In particular, these three actors continue to deliver the goods. Huzzah for them!If you don't over-expect and aren't bothered by the concerns cited here, then give season 5 a shot."
5,Hogan's Heroes-5th Season,Quality of merchandise is very good. These are very entertaining episodes of the comedy series and we look forward to completing our collection.
5,Hogan's Heroes 5th Season,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad, and he loved it! As always Hogan's Heroes provides plenty of laughs."
3,Not one of the better Star Wars stories.,"I listened to this book on audio cassette. Having a large collection of Star wars books and cassettes, I found myself dissappointed with this particular story. It was well read with excellent sound effects and cast. The story itself, lacked much of a beginning or a satisfying end. All and all I would not recommend this book to audio book fans."
3,You may want to go to the library to get this one.,"It started with a good plot but never finished what it started, this is not a book to bye, not saying it is not a book to read but you may want to go to the library to get this one. Not worth the money to own."
5,It was pretty cool.,"This was a great book, in my opinion, because it told how Kyle ended up going from an Imperial Officer to a Rebel Agent."
4,A good SW Book,"If you played the game, you will definitly like this book. It gives a great spinoff of the game.But since it uses the new game coming out in a couple of moth's you kinda loose some off the ideas as they mention caracther's you haven't still meet. But it gives you a great new caracther for those off us how are SW fan's."
3,The Game was better,"Soldier for the Empire is a rather odd graphic novel. It combines a short book with illustrations that vary from strong to below average. It expands on the Dark Forces series of video games, and follows Kyle Katarn from his days as an Imperial agent to becoming one of the most trusted agents of the Alliance, to his days as a Jedi Knight.The book had its moments, and most of the illustrations did the games, and the Star Wars universe credit. Unfortunately, there were some problems with the story (the sequence on the asteroid was a bit questionable so far as realism goes), and the drawings sometimes referred to the wrong pages. The book is better than its sequel, Rebel Agent, but comes up short when taking on the finale to the series, Jedi Knight. Buy that one instead, it isn't hard to figure out what's going on, particularly if you have played the game."
3,A good Star Wars story if you're looking for a light read.,"""Soldier for the Empire"" is an entertaining and fun Star Wars story on its own, but it's really geared toward those who are already fans of the ""Dark Forces"" computer game. While I enjoyed this book, I felt that the (often odd) illustrations hampered my experience as a reader. The book would have been better served using the artwork as chapter breaks, rather than having it so often disrupt your own mental picture of the story. Also, and more purely from a continuity point of view, ""Soldier for the Empire"" takes some liberties with established Star Wars characters, which may be annoying to those readers who are fans of the ""Dark Forces"" games and the Star Wars universe in general.All in all, ""Soldier for the Empire"" is an entertaining piece of Star Wars fiction, but it is not particularly well-written or especially well-illustrated."
5,Dietz could help to write Episodes 2 & 3,"Great book, actually, a great trilogy, if you get the hardcover editions they also make a great display for any respectable collection. The writing is down to earth, yet descriptive and complete, leaves you wanting to know more, especially great is the step by step narration Dietz makes of the first Dark Forces level. The illustrations are great, but i found a couple of errors in this book: Acording to JK game, Kyle doesn't get his lightsaber until level three of the game, this book refers to Dark Forces, so why is he painted with a saber in the cover and other 2 illustrations? Also, when he meets Jan, the description tells us he's wearing a Stortrooper armor, yet in the drawing he's not...great book, nevertheless..."
4,Exellent,"Overall this was a well writen book. Good characters, exellent story and good writing. My only disapointment with the book is that it containes certain discrepencies with the story overview from the game. Such as the cercumstaces of Kyle and Jan's meeting and his ""conversion"" to the Alliance. However the author had a good grasp of the storyline and characters and worked the game into the book quite well. If you loved the game like I did you'll love the book."
5,Lucky is great!,"I kind of went nuts on Lucky Thompson and really got into him over the last year, buying and procuring just about everything I can find. He is always fantastic and I don't think I have ever been disappointed. Lucky is so interesting in that he bridges the gap(s) from swing to bop and sometimes beyond. This is also a great series that is usually available for discount, low prices. I don't have the energy like a great reviewer would to research if this stuff is on other reissues; this is often the case with reissued material... with fine European musicians... the Gigi Gryce set is nice too with Art Farmer on a few cuts... a very fine album..."
1,Broken Casing,"The description was ""Like New"", which means it should be like new. The cd casing was broken so that the whole front plastic piece falls off. Ridiculous. This should be ""Ok"" at best. Very Disappointed."
1,A JOKE?,"I was looking for some books about adult dating and ran across the DiMarco books. I purchsed this book thinking it looked good for us older folks. Alas, as I started reading it, I realized that I know this Mr. Dimarco. He is a convicted felon and a habitual liar and he is now writing books? How could I take seriously anything he wrote in this book. I hope folks are NOT falling for his latest line of bull. He is a true [...] artist. [...]"
1,Warning: This book may cause you to throw it across the room.,"Some single friends and I read this book over a weekend get-together, and each of us, from varying dating backgrounds (forever alone, recently divorced, single for the moment) found it to be extremely insulting. At first we were open to what it was going to suggest, but after the chapters on women ""shutting up"" and ""never marry your best friend"" we could no longer take such trifle."
2,I own it and never watch it,"I first saw spectre when I was in the video store looking for a new horror movie to see....I've been watching horror movies for as long as I can remember and I love scary movies....I've seen so many, that Amazon has only a few listed that I haven't seen......I can definately say that this movie suxx.....Poltergeist is my favorite movie of all time, and Spetre copies it totally.....the begining is interesting and the only reason I give it 2 stars is that the parts that aren't of Poltergeist r very original and extrememly awesome. But as the movie progresses, the more it loses the originality it has and the more it looks like an Irish version of Poltergeist. I don't know why it's priced as it is .....that's a ridiculous price for this movie...and it's interesting to show to people.....I knew it wouldn't be a good movie though when I first rented it, because it hadn't been released in theaters, it went straight onto video. That's reason enoguh not to buy it."
3,Not his best,This was not one of Jaglom's best. I thought the plot was weak. On the other hand I felt the acting was superb.
2,New Years Movie,I was looking for an uplifting movie but this was depressing. The language was bad. The movie was slow. I usually will give a movie a chance to get better but I had to stop before it was over.
1,Bad,I almost fell asleep when I watched this movie. The movie is very boring and is not worth to buy. I never saw such annoying movie before.
5,When I first read this book I felt like dancing myself!,"That one-line summary is what my 7-year-old son said about this book, in addition to ""I love Ragtime Tumpie!"" I agree with him. This is a beautiful and inspiring book about Josephine Baker, the great jazz entertainer/dancer. The illustrations are radiant and evoke a sense of excitement, heat, and music. The story is emotionally engaging, and like my son says, makes you want to dance and jubilate along with Tumpie! This is a top-notch picture book!"
4,Mt husband loved this!,Difficult to understand the instructions but well worth the effort. I like the Indiglo. Very good all around watch that you can wear and not have to worry about. He loves it.
2,Not for an adult,Its a good watch however its quite light and I prefer it as a boys watch than an adult's watch. I will give it to my nephew.
4,Nice everyday watch,I like this watch a lot. This is my third of this model. It works well for me for everyday wear. I tend to be hard on watches. My previous models are all still keeping time with face is so scratched up they are hard to read.
1,Not the quality it used to be....,I thought this watch would be of the same quality as it used to be. Several years ago I had the same identical watch and loved it. When it failed and I was in need of a replacement I thought I would purchase another just like it based on my previous experience. Now I find the case is plastic? or at least not the metal it used to be and the band is a very chincy thin tin-like metal and overall is quite cheap construction. I am truly disappointed in the product. I question if it will last very long. I guess you get what you pay for now days.
1,"Worst Band ever, T2 Minutes cant be set!","I really cant understand the positive reviews here:This watch has the worst band ever. It keeps coming apart when it brushes against anything, shirts, trouser pockets or anything else really. It comes apart at the worst time ever.Another major defect in this watch is that you CANNOT SET the minutes for T2 (dual time). The T2 minutes is always the same as the main time. You can set everything else including date but not the minutes. I cant believe nobody else has commented on this huge drawback.Overall since I purchased it from Australia, its not worth my time/money shipping it all the way to the US.Very very disappointed and probably will be my first and last Timex watch ever."
2,Not so much,"I had this watch for less than two months. It kept nearly perfect time, it was good looking and very comfortable to wear. After about 4 weeks, I noticed a pin working loose from the band. I worked it back in multiple times and didn't think too much of it. In less than 8 weeks, the band separated and I had to send the watch back. My main reason for buying it was the hope that the band would last, so I'm very disappointed. I have no idea if my experience was unusual or not, but I've bought a more expensive watch as a result."
2,Bad clasp design,"Very nice looking watch, but the clasp design is very poor. When my boyfriend wore this watch the first day, he counted seven times that the end of the clasp would get caught on his clothes, or on items at work and come undone........very irritating, so we took this watch back after 2 days, and replaced it with another Casio which he has have worn that brand for the last 20 years now."
3,Date in the shadows,This is an excellent watch. The time is easy to read but the date is often in the shadows so is difficult to read.
2,Timex Atlantis 100 Bracelet Strap Watch,"Watch was basically fine. It was meant as a replacement. However, even though it was new, the strap itself showed signs of inferior quality."
5,Takes a lickin and keeps on tickin.,"Have used these watches for several years. The only reason to replace them is, because the window eventually gets scratched from use.Batteries last a long time."
3,not a bad watch for $31.00,its been a good watch other than ive only had it 7 months and a pin in the band keeps wanting to fall out.nothing a lil super glue wouldnt fix on each side of that 1 pin.
3,Looks Nice,"It is a nice looking watch, seems to be working fine. However the band seems very flimsy & cheap, and easy to fall apart."
2,NOtso good,"As I suspected when I received this watch, the band felt cheap, and It was it lasted less than a week. I suppose I will have to return it and either get another band, or get a different type of band. The watch itself seems to function ok, but not up to Timex ususal standards."
2,Not very pleased....,"I ordered this watch as a Christmas present for my grandson, and it wasn't too successful. He loved the watch, but the band doesn't work properly. When he puts it on, the final section of the watch band won't lock into place. I'll take it to a local watch shop to see what it will cost to correct it, but this experience has taught me that buying something sight-unseen probably isn't the best way to go...."
3,substandard,"I thought I was replacing my Timex with, I thought, the same model that was lost. The band was so flimsy that the pins would slid out of the watch. the watch itself appeared to be the same as previous owned."
5,the watch that is lasting me the longest,"I have my watch for 16 years, replaced battery once, now I'm looking for a replacement band that finally broke one of the rubber links. Just love it. May get another one just in case. I'm glad Timex still making this model."
5,A watch that matched my need,My Timex men's T77517 Atlantis Stainless Steel Bracelet Watch met my need exactly. I don't like buckle watch bands and I did not want to pay a high price since so many watches are very inexpensive. It seemed that for watches without a buckle band the price skyrocketed. I wanted a watch that was water proof since my last watch got moisture in it just from my sweat. Besides meeting everything wanted I was pleasently surprised how light weight it was and how nice looking it was.
5,Really good,"I'm fairly hard on watches - bumping/banging them, scratch crystals, getting chemicals on them, etc.My last one lasted 7 years - without a battery change.I ordered two of these."
1,"Badly written, full of mistakes, devoid of depth","Just because a person decides to write a book on the Three Stooges does not mean he understands the Three Stooges - or even has a feel for the subject. This book is riddled with factual errors and reeks of a person who couldn't hold his own in a casual discussion with Stooge fans. Nearly all of the (correct) information in the book is available plenty of places elsewhere, and by authors who truly know the subject."
2,Middling,"A nicely packaged book. If you're new to Stooge fandom, then this is a good book for you. But, if you're a longtime fan who wants to read and learn...MOE HOWARD AND THE THREE STOOGES (by Moe Howard himself) *THE THREE STOOGES SCRAPBOOK (co-authored by Moe's daughter) *CURLY (again, co-authored by Moe's daughter) *THE COMPLETE THREE STOOGES (by Dr. Jon Solomon)...Those are the books you should buy!If you decide otherwise, this book is a nice simple read, with nothing new to offer. There are better ways to learn about the Three Stooges."
5,"Creative, fun, very French","Creative, fun, very French. The premise may seem strange, the characters stranger but inside the movie it all makes perfect sense."
5,So rich and vital,"This movie, the music, camera angles, storyline, acting was all superb. As zany as parts of it were it was so believable and real. It cut through the prejudices so beautifully. Loved the distinction between being part of a culture and religious choices. Well done, humor and tenderness. Love all the way through."
2,not pleased with littlest pet shop,"I wanted to purchase the littlest pet shop guinea pig for my grandaughter. What she ended up getting was a dog. Online it said there was 1 guinea pig left. The company emailed me and said there were none left ( even though when I went back to look, it said there was still one left). They called me and gave me inlet three options to choose from. I felt they were false advertising and will not purchase anything from them again."
4,it's cool....,"it's a good book for those that don't know much about the boys. you know, like for those 1st time fans. that's why i got it when i first started liking bsb. it's really helpful for those 1st time fans though. it gives lots of info and has great pictures. i recommend it."
5,Just Awesome.,"Great craftsmanship on every level. The production, sound, and even the lighting add great elements of mood to this concert dvd. The song selection is perfect. It leaves you with the feeling of wanting more, but feeling very satisfied with what you just witnessed....a work of art."
2,Tantra? Probably not,"I guess my biggest problem in looking over this book is that it has very little or nothing to do with Tantra. They do say this in the book, but insist on calling the book tantra which is very misleading. These are many techniques that ultimately enhance our attachment to our partner and our sensual experience, not as a means to free your mind and achieve liberation from suffering by removing all attatchments and aversions. If you are looking for a better sensual experience, though, then this book might be for you.Bottom line: Tantra is not about having a hot sexual experience. It is true spirituality. 99.9% has nothing to do with sex. Books like this that spin Tantra into further levels of misconception and media-trashiness are, I think, very harmful.Still, most people looking at this book are probably looking for a better time in bed, and a way to get closer to your partner. If that is what you are looking for, this book might serve you well."
2,pleasant erotica only,this is not really about Tantra. It sort of introduces some basic tantric concepts and then gives you a gentle erotic story. eh. no big deal. not worth the money if you are looking to learn about tantra.
3,"Red Hot Tantra: Erotic Secrets of Red Tantra for Intimate, soul-to-soul sex and ecstatic, enlightened orgasms",This book sounds as if it would be a good read. I have found it much moredifficult to read than most books. Perhaps it's the subject matter. This bookexpounds upon the way to lead an Enlightened Life overall. I can not recommendthis book because I have had so much difficulty keeping my mind on the sujectmatter.
4,Time is circle...,"Giga Shadow ends the Lexx movies. If you do not know Lexx or hate it, give the movies a chance. Starting with ""I Worship His Shadow"" and ending with this tape is a fine way to start enjoying Lexx. Is it high budget? No but does sport some impressive visuals and great actors portraying out of the norm characters. It is a good mix of sci-fi themes that tend to get ignored by the stoic shows. Sex, violence, gore, and just plain odd... Lexx is the hybrid of Red Dwarf (minus the sitcom) and a third world country blue movie set inside an insect. Giga Shadow is worth owning for repeated viewing."
3,Sloppy Proofreading Detracts from Content,"Jentz is one of the finest armor scholars around and Osprey usually does a good job with many of their titles but the publisher made a mess of this one. The reader will be annoyed by glaring editing errors, mispellings, awkward paragraph formatting, and poor proofing. The production history of the vehicle could also have been presented in tabular form instead of chunks of text. There is good info here but you will have to tolerate the inexcusable editing."
3,ANNOYING EDITING DETRACTS FROM CONTENT,"Jentz is one of the finest armor scholars around and the New Vanguard series is a budget edition for building a modeling reference library BUT the atrocious spelling, grammar, page/text layout & formatting sprinkled throughout the text seriously detracts from the value & enjoyment derived from perusing a well done reference publication. The editing is really inexcusable. Much information regarding production details could also have been presented more effectively in tabular form. The publisher did such a bad job on proofreading that only if you have a very high tolerance for the flaws and also believe that there are no errors in the factual content will it enable you to confidently accept the contents."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. I have read a couple other of Marcus Buckingham's books and have also heard him speak. He is great. However, this book was boring, long and repetitive. And, because I ""heard"" the book vs. reading it, and it has a series of exercises to be completed as you read it (which one cannot do while driving), it made it even worse. Do not recommend the book and definitely recommend less the CD."
3,Good but wordy,"Focus on playing to your strengths instead of focusing on improving your weaknesses. Doing so will help you be a more all around satisfied and productive person. Buckingham's ""strengths revolution"" could revolutionize the way people think about themselves and production in the workplace. Imagine sitting with your supervisor as he or she reviews your strengths and blazes the trail for you to improve those strengths--as opposed to confronting your weaknesses, which Buckingham says you'll never really master anyway.Good book, could be a brief, one hour read."
4,Excel at your strengths,"A continuation of the 'strengths finder' series, 'Go Put Your Strengths to Work' is a good addition to the bookshelf, albeit the lessons could have been presented more concisely.The core message is that the process of building on your strengths is independent of your weaknesses - the book's surrounding six lessons explore the details of putting this theoretically simple practice to work. We often obsess over our weaknesses, constantly trying to improve and cover them up. Instead, change your mindset, focus on your strengths, build your environment around them, and you will excel at a much faster pace. The author walks you through the process of helping to identify your strengths, build on them, and offers suggestions for changing the external environment to assist you in this endeavor."
5,Worth the read,I read this over a brief vacation during the summer. Ive found it has enhanced my abilities dealing with people both at work and my personal life. I plan on reading it again when my busy work schedule permits it.
4,Revealing,"I my search for success and improved life, I have gone through all the Stephen Covey's work on the 7 habits of effective people, leadership & execution training; yet I still could not answer what my strengths were, which makes climbing the wrong latters in the first place.This book offers the other side of the coing, something to do with what you cant learn; talent. The thing is that you must read the previous book in order to identify them with the strenght finder included.Once you know your talents, read this book, follow the process and use the tools; it all makes more sence, you simply start seeing your self with more potential. AWSOME."
1,Don't Buy Kindle Edition,"Do not buy the Kindle edition. You do not get the code needed to complete the online survey or get the results of the survey. Don't buy a used version either. The code can only be used once, so if you buy a used book, you're missing out on the most important part of the material.My employer bought a few cases of this book as a followup to last year's training on Strength Finders. They said that they would reimburse anyone who wanted an electronic version. Unfortunately, an electronic version is missing the key to discovering your strengths and how to best use them.Buy a new hard copy. The material is useful."
4,Excellent thoughts to start everyday,"First, let me say that I love Buckingham's work and believe in his Strength Movement wholeheartedly. As a former school teacher, his initiative with public schools is phenomenal.For me, the most useful inference in ""Go put your..."" is that everyday one should make sure that they are moving in the direction of their strengths (even if it is just one small step) and away from their weaknesses. There is a quote that I like- I believe it relates to playing towards your strengths...""If you will spend an extra hour each day of study in your chosen field, you will be a national expert in that field in five years or less."" Earl Nightingale, 212 the extra degree"
2,Go Put Your Strengths To Work: 6 Powerful Steps to Achieve Outstanding Performance,I feel like I wasted my time with this book. It was too vague and not helpful. The previous book was excellent this one was just an attempt to make more money.
3,GO Put Your Strengths to Work,"I'm still reading this book, but it's been good in helping apply one's Strengths in a practical way."
2,A little on the monotonous side,"I am beginning to realise that if you ve read one self help book then you ve red them all. This book has nothing that has not been said before.The writing style, for me atleast, was a little boring and couldnt keep my attention for long."
1,Poor Movie Sequel,"This book is similar to going to a poor movie sequel. There is nothing new and it bores you with percentages. The title and cover are the best aspects of the book - once you open it and begin reading, it quickly goes downhill. Save your money - I wish I had."
2,Buy this new,"This book is based on a character test that is done online. It can only be done once, so make sure that this is a new book and that nobody else has used the code."
4,Great simple tools to use immediately,"I especially loved the questions to use to identify specfically if an activity is a strength -- the who/ what/ when/ why... Does it matter for whom you are doing this activity? Does it matter what the subject is? etc. These shortcut questions are something that can be applied immediately and easily. This is Buckingham's strength in most of his book, and this book is no exception: straightforward, easy to grasp concepts that can be immediately applied."
5,BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!,"OK, so the other day I found a show called Playful Kiss - it was great. I then decided that I would check out some other Korean shows (I am in USA). This one looked good so I started watching. Basically it was so good that I couldn't stop watching until I was done with all 25 episodes....and now I want to watch it again! This is by far the BEST show I have ever watched PERIOD! You will not be disappointed."
2,Subtitles are subpar,"I want to make it very clear that this review isn't for the show itself, but the actual dvd set. This series is AWESOME, which is why it was the first K-Drama I bought. What's wrong with it is the subtitles are not good. True, there are no misspellings or grammatical errors, but the subtitles we receive are a condensed version of what is actually being spoken. Its not too hard to figure out that there is more dialogue being spoken than is actually being translated. I recognize Korean is a difficult language to translate because there is so much meaning conveyed in how words are spoken rather than the actual words themselves, however there are better versions available. Drama Fever has much more involved subtitles that show how much we have lost in this dumbed-down set. Unfortunately, I can't find it on dvd, which is disappointing because otherwise this series would be perfect."
4,Good,The handling and shipping of this product was very good. In addition the quality of the DVDs were awesome and although the music was a little different (which was expected) it was still worth it.
4,Alpena Steering Wheel Spinner,"Product works fine. It has enough grip to stay planted on just about any steering wheel. Very handy that it comes with a rubber insert just incase your steering wheel isn't padded in which case it may not be thick enough for the spinner to get a good grip. This spinner is very solid and has sharp points on the inside which enables it to bite down and into your padded steering wheel with enough force to stay put. Just make sure to adjust the heavy duty screw as tightly as possible for maximum grip. The down side to this is, with such force on your steering wheel little holes or impressions are inevitable from the sharp points. Especially if your steering wheel is padded. There are better spinners out there, but none in this price range. This one is by far the best in it's class or for the price...."
2,item too small to fit on steering wheel,tried to attach to steering wheel and it was too small. put a larger screw in and stilldid not work. meantime I had thrown out the packaging so I am stuck with the item.
2,Won't fit,"THis thing looks pretty cool but I have tried it on several makes and models without it fitting. The clamp is way too small in diameter to fit steering wheels of todays cars. Chrysler sebring, mustang, evan a minivan...?????...!!!!!!"
2,Could've been.......,"I bought this CD after reading the enthusiastic reviews and seeing some of my other fav musicians referenced as comparisons. I was thinking I would be getting something along the lines of The Sundays, Style Council, or Komeda perhaps. While the music (or I should more accurately say arrangements or accompaniment) is, for the most part, as described by the other reviewers - cool, jangly, jazz-tinged continental pop - I couldn't stomach the vocalist. Her weak, thin, nasally, overly mannered vocals remind me of some 19 yr. old who thinks she should be a singer (or the next American Idol!) because she can hold a tune. Unfortunately, despite solid songwriting, playing, and arranging, the vocals have made this album unlistenable for me."
5,Spiritual Healing: Words from Beyond:,"I love this book ! The words has given me great comfort. They have given me the strength to look inside myself. When I read this I feel love, warmth and a new outlook on life. I don't think you will be disappointed. I found if you open to any page at any time there will be a message just for you. It works."
5,Absolutely hilarious,"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. He hit the nail on the head talking about life in the military revolving around cars, music, partying and chasing women. I couldn't put it down after I bought, only breaking for sleep and food. This book is hilarious and a must read if you were/are in the military. I guarantee you will be able to relate to something in this book."
5,Quality Bogen product - as always,"This light stand was just what I was looking for. It is a light weight, but strong stand that I use for holding my disc reflectors. Bogen always produces high quality stands and tripods. The posts slide effortlessly and when latched, stay where you intend. I would recommend this stand to anyone."
3,Light but not stable,"I returned it because it wasn't strong enough for out in the field. Its fine for a reflector but not a monolight/strobe. The stand weighs a little over 2 lbs, put 5 lbs strobe and then softbox/umbrella... well you get the picture. It's not poorly made,but it's not made to support anything heavy. You could weigh it down with sand bags but then what would be the point of getting a light stand?"
5,My Favorite Book,"I found this book when I was 11 years old and have read it so many times over the years that it is falling apart. If you want to laugh, cry, and just have one hell of a ride.. read this book!"
4,Subtle humour,"Full of subtle humour, a most enjoyable read. As always, Murdoch's characters, even the minor players, are beautifully drawn."
4,AWESOME PROJECT,"This project is awesome! Those who will take the time to listen to it, will experience the magnificent glory of God in each track. This artist is truly gifted to praise God on the sax!Many blessings to this man of God for the future."
2,Passable,"Great playing, crappy songs. Jimi had only a handful of good songs. Too bad he wasn't as good a songwriter as he was a musician, so his playing could be placed within an enjoyable framework."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased 2 of these traps for inside a business. We didn't notice a difference. After a month I opened it up to clean out the bag and from both traps I found only 1 Mosquito. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Do not waste your money!,I have had this item for over two weeks and have tried it in a couple different places in the yard. The mosquitos (and flies) are still attracted to the dogs and people more than this foolish machine. I have emailed the company several times with questions and have received not one response. It has caught less than 10 mosquitos in two weeks time. Definitely a disappointment and waste of money. Should have gotten a good old-fashioned bug zapper!
1,Catches everything but...,I had high hopes for the Mega Catch Alpha. We have a bad mosquito problem. We continue to try every product we can get our hands on. I received the Alpha late last year. We run in continuously in the back yard. The results were questionable. Running it again this summer has convinced me it's not making a dent in our mosquito population. Looking in the catch bag reveals a small amount of other flying insects but few if any mosquitoes. It's back to the drawing board for us.
1,worthless,"I myself had read the wide range of reviews here about this product, but decided to give it a try, as dengue fever had recently been discovered near my house in South Florida. Thankfully, there's an easy way to see if this thing is catching any mosquitoes - the trap bag. Unfortunately, the only bug it caught was a small moth. Still plenty of mosquitoes. After a few week, it's in the closet. I even used the separately sold chemical attractant. No good."
1,I agree,"Just like the last poster, I had high hopes. And it doesn't seem to be doing anything but making my yard look like a disco and driving up my utility costs."
4,A terrific mixture of history and mystery!,"Sybil Downing does a wonderful job of evoking the menace of the 1920s in Colorado when the KKK ran the state, from the governor's office to the local precinct. Newspaper reporter Liz O'Brien balks at the constraints of ""society reporter,"" sets out to cover the hard news, and finds herself up against the KKK and murder. It's a terrific plot, with strong and determined characters. No one intends to back down--certainly not the KKK and not Liz! I very much enjoyed this novel. Downing is that rare writer who knows how to serve up a lot of solid history while telling a terrific story."
3,historical fiction or murder mystery,"Downing composes an intriguing plot, creates vivid characters and interesting scenes, but the Klan --excepting a couple of episodes -- remains largely in the bakcground. The book ends abruptly with several unresolved political issues left hanging. ""The Binding Oath"" reads like a murder mystery rather than historical fiction. I wanted more about the development of the Klan in Colorado."
1,Does not work well for Fiesta grill replacement,"I loved my old Fiesta Optima grill, and hoped to keep it running with these new burners, but they don't work very well at all.They failed to put enough gas into the front rail to allow the igniters to ignite the gas.When I went back to lighting the burners myself the flow of gas was not uniform enough to allow the entire edge of the burners to ignite.In short, if this company wants to make a good, useful product, they are going to have to match the original Fiesta Burners to a much closer degree.Other than them not working, they were very well made and fit just fine so this company knows how to make good things.The sad part is that my old grill had to be replaced because there are no workable parts to keep it running.This old Fiesta was a great grill, it deserves to have someone make parts for it that actually work."
4,Great for the price,"I give this four stars since one of the five stands broke right away at the weld. Still, for the price I can't complain."
3,This Approach Has Limits...,"The approach described by this book has limits. Without legal requirements for endangered species preservation and restoration, private landowners will be reluctant to take steps that threaten the ""bottom line"" or maximum profit potential of their operations.Ranching and other land use business is a BUSINESS. You can't expect a business to make an economic sacrifice for environmental reasons alone.In the case of the Big Hole Watershed Committee, this once promising group closed ranks during the Bush II years. Because the group no longer had to worry about an Endangered Species Act listing under the anti-environmental Bush administration, the group talked about ""restoring fluvial Arctic grayling"" but in fact grayling populations plummeted ever close rtoward extinction under the Watershed Committee's water management. Without generous earmark appropriations from former (discredited) Senator Conrad Burns, the group would not even exist."
4,An important topic for everyone to understand better,"This book presents the approaches and challenges of conservation efforts over the last few decades. I wish it had been more tightly edited -- it was repetitive and a bit tedious to read.Essentially the points of the book are:1) The best approaches for conserving species is more of a decision based on values than hard science. The complexity of understanding everything that affects a species is too much to expect science to ""know all the answers"".2) Conservaton efforts based on today's isolated parks and reserves is inadequate because they're too small. Finding ways to expand their ""effective boundaries"" is important.3) The influence of man and the interplay of nature in and around parks and reserves is important to understand well enough to make effective conservation choices.4) It's imperative to include local communities in the discussion of the issues and obtaining committment to the solutions."
4,calender girl/Jason Priestley,"Enjoyed the movie very much, reminded of my own fantasies about Marilyn. What really interested me most was the use of a '61 Dodge convertible and ocasionally a hardtop. I had a convertible in my younger days and never got a picture of it. It was my first new car and enjoyed it immensely.Did Marilyn actually own a '61 Dodge or was that writers priveledge?One question I did have - I saw the movie on TV last Fall and it seems there was scenes missing from the video I purchased. One scene in particular where Jason is driving the Dodge with the top down. I even rented a copy from Blockbusters and that was the same as my video. I've been waiting for it to come back on TV again so I can varify what I saw or was I dreaming."
3,A persepective from and actors point of view,"In the movie Calendar Girl I play the Jerry O'Connel, 6-year old flash back. I was in another part that did not make it to the final cut. Anyways, I went to the screening of the movie and I saw it in theatres. Overall my thoughts on it have been so-so. All I have to say is it could have been better. But it couldn'y be any worse. If your looking for a movie to rent on a Wensday night then rent Calendar Girl. You won;t be dissapointed."
5,Calendar Girl (Hard to find),"I love this movie! It's a buddy movie for guys. It was not super popular and I only watched it because I was a 90210 fan. This is a dvd that was converted from VHS and it's a GREAT picture, you wouldn't know it was converted!"
5,love story,As these 3 boys that had a heart throb for Monroe they prosu finding her as older men. And only one scores at geting a date. A must watch.
5,Looking for a taste of Centro America?,"If you have ever been to the region and would like to bring back something other than photos, this CD is a must. Or, if you want a taste of the region, your palate will not be disappointed. The music takes me back everytime I listen!"
3,Incomplete,"Incomplete. What else can I say? This is a good mix, and a good cd, but the title is Islands. So, why not throw something a little more exotic into the mix? Cuba and Hawaii are predictable, but what about music from the Azores? What about the Madeira Islands? A little Luis Bettencourt, some Jose Medeiros, or Katia Guerreiro and this cd would have been a whole lot better!!!"
5,Great Product,Very good choice. Good range for most torquing. Quality built. Made in the USA. Will be reliable for years to come because it doesn't need calibrating as does a clicker or dial style. My old clicker was way out of calibration. Not as user friendly as a clicker but nice to know it will still be accurate the next time I need it.
3,Decent Wrench,This torque wrench is advertised was advertised at the time as having a decent Newton Scale on it but when I received it that part was labeled in huge increment jumps and was completely unmarked after 65 Nm. Other than that it works fine.
4,Keepin it real for Dallas,"If you like some laid back gangsta type music with some laid back beats, then you'll love this cd. It doesn't have all them shake ya booty type beats, or he don't rap about things he don't got, like most of the other rappers talk about. He keeps it real from Dallas. Him and the other Stoney Crooks (Mr. Pookie, and Mr. Lucci) are guaranteed to make you feel it. But if you get one then you gotta get the others, cause they go together like Bonnie & Clyde, Starsky & Hutch, Big & Pac; or maybe not but you get the point. But I don't want you to believe me, I want you to find out for yourself."
4,good price and stainless,Over the years I have had many eye straps fail and all were bronze with or without a chrome covering. Stainless is a better choice if you want something that will last in a marine environment.
4,Supplies for a boat dock,The eye srap was as described. Arrived on time. I would recommend them to some of my friends. I have not actually place the eye straps on my dock. So they may rust within the first month. Time will tell.
3,NOT made in USA!,"I purchased this because it said it was made in the USA. Once received, I looked on back of package to verify and that's when I read ""assembled in the USA"". When I took the mirror out of the package there was a sticker saying made in China or Taiwan (I cann't remember now). I honestly believe that all the USA did was put it in the package.The mirrior does work. That is the only reason it received 3 stars from me!"
4,Looks Great!,"Looks great - covers up the nasty looking head bolts. Half the price of OEM Harley bolts. Only problem was the set screws were extremely tight. One actually broke. The other three bent my allen wrench. Vendor was awesome and replaced them. New ones are also tight, but better."
5,Juanita Bynum,Fantastic album. So glad I found it and was able to purchase it. The Cd was in great shape and arrived promptly.
5,Morning Glory,"I love this CD it is very peaceful, and I advise anyone that need peace listen to this CD you will enjoy it."
5,Perfect Timing,"I would just like to say that i recently purchased the video tape of Morning Glory volume one. It has blessed my soul over and over again. I pray that the annointing that I felt was and is felt by all who listen or watch the tape.This tape (blessing) came in perfect timing.You are my peace was put on a tape for us last year,and the tape was broken.I knew that during my storm that GOD was my peace.Though sometimes our situations can become overbearing.To hear the interview before the song came on was a blessing all in itself.I just want to thank GOD for all that participated in the project.Well done and may GOD continue to bless all of you."
1,Lacking the Anointing,"I heard Dr. Bynum sing in person when she first came on the scene. The anointing of God sounded through her. She sounds stifled in this CD. I was rather disappointed that the anointing of God is not evident in any of the songs recorded, including my favorite Like the Dew. Instead, each song sounds scripted and measured. If God leads you to purchase this CD, do so for that reason alone. Otherwise, you may not be satisfied."
5,BELIEVING IT LIVING IT LOVING IT,JUANITA BYNUM'S MESSAGE THROUGH MORNING GLORY WAS FOUND TO BE INSPIRING UPLIFTING AND UNDERSTANDING I AM INDEED ENCOURAGED TO GO THROUGH EACH DAY WITH VICTORY I REALIZE THAT IN EVERY SITUATION WHETHER GOOD OR BAD GOD WILL GRANT ME PEACE AND THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL ABIDE.
5,PURE LIQUID ANNOINTING,"I cannot find the words to truly express the annointing that is upon this CD. When you listen to it, you feel empowered. It is serene and calming. Listening to it brings peace to you and helps you to see your life as beautiful. I am looking forward to her making more CDs. I am sure they will all be as good as this one is. BUY THIS ONE, YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID!!"
2,christmas story,A little too long of a story for the message that is taught. It seemed like a cuter idea based on the editorial review but in the end is just another take on be thankful for what you have. I'm not saying that's not an important message to learn....this was just a boring way to teach it.
2,More mystic than scientific.,"I was hoping to get more science out of the book. It is about reincarnation, traveling through time, and Atlantis. Nothing about building the Coral Castle except that he did it at night when no one was looking and no one knows how he did it. Hmmmm....magic I suppose....it was not what I expected. If you are into reincarnation and believe in Atlantis, you might enjoy the book.I do like one idea from the book: Nothing is new, everything has been done before. I think this is true in one way or another - humans reinvent and repackage ideas but rarely come up with new ones."
1,Good for one use only,"Mandrel adapter is impossible to remove after using the 2 1/8 inch hole saw. If you intend to use this product more than once, you'll have to buy a separate 1-inch saw/mandrel."
3,"Like design, but so-so hole saws","I've used it on one job (three doors), and I think it will last well. I don't know about the quality of the hole saws though. My used Ridgid 2-1/4"" saw cut MUCH better than the new Dewalt. At least that switch enables me to keep each size on its own arbor. Swapping saws would be tedious otherwise."
4,Works well but...,"It worked well but the larger holesaw bit stripped, on the arbor, as I was drilling. Luckily I had another holesaw the same size to finish. Otherwise the setup and alignment worked flawlessly. It lost a star for the broken holesaw."
3,"Works nice, but hole saw broke after one use","I used this quite successfully for one door. I started with the 1"" hole saw, and then cut the 2.125"" hole with the larger saw. It was tough to unscrew the 1"" from the pilot adapter, but overall everything went well. The next day I decided to do a couple more doors and couldn't get the 1"" hole saw to screw onto the adapter. The threads had totally died and were unusable. I had to use another 1"" hole saw that I had, luckily.Other than the problems switching between hole saws, this product is pretty nice for standard doors."
3,Just alright.,"I used this kit on about 10 doors so far and I have to agree with others here with regards to the mandrel adapter; it is poorly designed and gets stuck often. It actually gets/got stuck so often that rather than mess around with it I leave it on the 2 1/8 inch hole saw and just use a 1"" spade bit versus switching out the mandrel to the 1"" adapter. Grinding down on some of the cheap plastic hole guide is unavoidable as well, at least it was for me. Lastly if you clamp it on the door too tight you may leave dimples in the door, so be gentle.Bottom line, it is a cheap tool and I would not use it professionally. For the DIY'er and a couple of doors, it is ""ok"" for the price."
2,"Guide Okay, Saws Not So Much","The guides worked fine, but the saws caused me considerable agnst. After I tried to go back to the 1' saw to finish the last 1/8' of the deadbolt hole, I couldn't get the mandrel out. It had gotten so tight while drilling, there was no way for me to get it loose (believe me, I tried for a good 45 minutes). So, I couldn't finish the deadbolt install until today when I ran to the hardware store and bought a set of boring bits. Dewalt obviously didn't do much testing if so many other reviewers are stating the same problem. Bottom line, you really don't need a guide. Save your money and just get a couple hole saws and measure, it's not that hard."
2,Not up for heavy duty use,Bought this to install 5 dead bolts in metal skinned wood doors. After the third door the large whole cutter was to dull to use. The jig works pretty well as long as there is clearance. I had a problem with the window trim not allowing the jig to go all the way up to the door.
4,Definitely Good Enough,"It works perfectly. But it will probably not last long if you have a bunch of doors to do. That being said, I would definitely buy it again."
2,"It works in a pinch, but I would not buy it again.","This tool works O.K. but not great. The biggest flaw/drawback that I found is with the guides for the holesaws. These guides should be taller/longer. By having the taller/longer guides for the holesaw you will be able to get a much straighter, square cut than you do with the short guides. With the short guides, it would be fairly easy to cut the holes at an angle. I would not reccomend this tool to someone that was looking at it. Until the design is changed (for the better, not just to make it cheaper) just pass it by and save up for a better one. I saw the Dewalt name, and thought quality, nope!"
1,Dewalt Dismay,"DEWALT D180004 Bi-Metal Door Lock Installation Kit Rural Area, no options, imagine my dismay when the 1"" hole saw didn't fit the chuck. I cut the hole for the lock, and was ready to cut the side of the door and could not finish the lock because the 1"" hole saw was not compatible. Disgusted."
3,Need separate mandrel for smaller bimetal hole saw,"I agree with mandrel limitation. I can't separate the adapter from the mandrel and can't use it on the smaller bi-metal hole saw. There is only one mandrel plus adapter. Once I used the adapter plus mandrel on the large bimetal hole saw, I couldn't separate the adapter to fit the mandrel to the smaller bimetal hole saw. To fit the large bimetal hole saw you need the mandrel plus adapter. To fit the small bitmetal hole saw, you need the mandrel without the adapter. There is no hex around the adapter to make it easy to separate. It was also difficult to separate the mandrel from the bimetal hold saw. You will have to buy a second mandrel to use this product without agravation."
1,Not what I expected,"According to Dewalt, they have upgraded this unit to include two quick-change mandrels that eliminate all of the stuck saw problems. The unit received was the old, obsolete unit with the single mandrel and adapter that has to be swapped between the two hole saws.If Amazon and its partners are going to sell the obsolete units, then I think it is time to buy tools elsewhere!"
5,I love these things!,"When I first went Raw Vegan I knew I would have problems because I am not a huge fan of green veggies, I found these Rebar bars at a health food store and they have helped me soo much in getting my nutritional needs met!I love them, and think they taste pretty good!!"
1,No longer that good since they added oil,"Update for 2012. The company change the formula. No oil has been added to the list of ingredients. Based on that Ive stopped buying this. Really a bummer that they changed.Old formula review from 2008. I've been enjoying ReBar for years. As a vegan looking for a a low fat snack bar, this is the best. Better than just having some dried fruit because it has Veggies also! You get greens, veggies, and fruit packed into one bar. I often roll a bar in some granola or nuts to give it a bit more built. Great for some energy without the sugar and soy or milk proteins found in other bars. Taste is very nice, as it's not too sweet like date bars, but it doesn't have that odd grassy taste of pure wheat grass juice."
4,Good choice for a lunch:-),It's not delicious but tastes better and healthier than other meal replacement bars. The cleansing effect is amazing probably because of fiber. I did replace my lunch with 2 bars and it worked great. I combine usually ReBar with Choco Raspberry bars from Garden Of Life :-)
4,Had to have one for myself,"I bought this book as a gift, but had to buy two so I could keep one. It covers all the standard herbs in the standard way, but what stands out in this little book are the photos of some very creative uses for the herbs. The ""cooking with herbs"" section is also well done and I've actually used some of the recipes! The print is very small, but the typeface is clear and simple so that helps to keep it readable."
1,Torque scale mis-aligned,"I had high hopes for this torque wrench, but when you using the fine-scale on the rotating base ring and match the ZERO position to the center-line, your torque setting is either above or below the desired torque hash-mark. Thus, you have no way of knowing how to set it. Should you set it above the hash mark, or below? If you guess wrong, you will be off 15 LB-FT. Sure, it came with a calibration certificate that has good values, but there is not way of knowing whether the calibrator set his zero index to above or below the hash line. This unit should have never left the factory this way. I will be replacing it with a Snap-ON or Stanley-Proto."
4,Excellent reference for the database user,"I'm not a DBA, and I don't pretend to be one. I'm a C++ programmer and the only time I care about SQL is when I'm trying to coerce some database to give up the information I need. As I don't develop on an internet connected machine, I'm constantly running to the Google Gods to answer my SQL questions. But no more! This book keeps me in front of my dev machine where I belong. It has just the right level of detail. I find it very akin to a man page level of detail, which is perfect for my needs. It also presents SQL statements for various implementations; the MySQL and Postgres inclusion is key! Overall, it makes an excellent reference. I don't think you'd be able to learn the language or discover advanced techniques from it though."
4,Nice Pocket Reference For SQL,"This is a nice, quick guide for referencing SQL. This book is not a 900 page behemoth to teach you all the ins and outs of SQL setup and performance tweaking, nor is it a 30 page list of commands. Rather, it is a nice ""tweener"" guide (200+ pages) to get your feet wet and remind you of what commands are and how SQL can be used. 'SQL In A Nutshell' covers SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, going over the SQL standards that you can expect from these favorite flavors of SQL. Light on examples but heavy on syntax, I feel that this is a nice companion manual to have at your side when you need to remind yourself how a particular command should be written.If you are a SQL developer could you live without this manual? Yes you probably could live without it, but it's handy to have at your side and I would recommend it.**** RECOMMENDED"
3,Disappointing,"I purchased this book because I work with several different database platforms, and I wanted a thorough reference that covered the syntax differences between platforms. That seems to be exactly what this book intends to be. Unfortunately, while it does do a good job with what it covers, there are topics that are not covered, with no indication that anything is missing. For example, common table expressions (WITH clauses in SELECT statements), which are included in the SQL-99 standard and have been supported by DB2 for quite a while, are not even mentioned. I have the second edition, and perhaps common table expressions have been added in the third edition (since SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL now support them, too), but that edition is not useful for me because DB2 coverage has been inexplicably removed. So, while this is still a useful book, it's not up to the usual high standards of O'Reilly's Nutshell series."
2,Not very good,"I bought the book because of the O'Reilly Nutshell label. However, I should have realized from the start how thin it was (200 pages). Not only is this book think physically, it's thin in every sense of the word. I was hoping for a very complete reference. Instead, SQL in a Nutshell is woefully shallow. For example, it spends only about 20 small, well-spaced pages on the SELECT statement. 20 pages to cover what is arguably the most important statement in all of SQL. Throughout the book, Kline skimps on the specific quirks of each RDBMS. You'd be much better off reading the doc set for whatever RDBMS you choose."
4,An SQL Reference Book,"This book covers various ""flavors"" of SQL, but not all of them. This was a ""recommended"" reference book for a college-level Introduction to SQL course. I will keep the book around as a technical reference even though I discovered it was a lot easier to find PostgreSQL syntax information by typing a command into Google and scanning the results for examples."
4,The Casual Users Reference,"Reviewers seem to be pretty mixed on this book; Casual SQL users like it, SQL Programmers don't. From reading the book, I would agree. If I were a SQL Programmer, this would be a terrible reference, as it does give the basics for MS-SQL, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL (which does tends to look a little muddled for those of us who scan a lot). But I am not a SQL Programmer. I am a casual SQL user, who writes the occasional query for Access and MS-SQL databases. I know the general syntax and base language (which this book did show me), and any time I get in a jam, I've been able to solve my issue using this reference. It was worth the purchase and has never let me down."
4,good choice if you work with more than one flavor of SQL,"If you find yourself tripping over the different flavors of SQL in MS SQL Server, MySQL, Postgre, and Oracle, then buy this book. This is not a good book to learn SQL or set theory. Nor is this a good book to use to learn how to manage or tune a database. This is a small enough reference that you can easily carry it out of the house or office."
4,Ready to use !,"As a project manager, I recommand this book to all db practiser. The ""atout"" of the book is the clear list of function for RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle, PostGreSQL and SQL Server."
1,Pretty disappointing,"Based on the O'Reilly name, I was expecting a pretty good book, but this one really smells. First, it's very sloppy. It looks like it needs another round of proofreading. Second, it skims way too much stuff. The SELECT chapter, for example, is as lame as can be - about 20 pp. if memory serves. Third, it's just not written well. This book definitely isn't up to the standards of the other O'Reilly titles."
2,The devil is in the details,"The problem with this book is that it covers various SQL dialects, but don't tell you how to convert between them. Because of this basic flaw the book falls flat on its face as far as I'm concerned."
3,Different view,"Ok, I agree that the new characters were welcome and interesting because frankly, by the end of season three, the Peter/Assumpta relationship had pretty much run it's course as far as holding my interest. As long as Brian Quigley and loonies, Liam and Donal were back, I was happy. I did, however, hate...HATE...the way the show handled the dissolution of Niamh and Ambrose's marriage. Granted Niamh married him for all the wrong reasons (thumbing her nose at her father was my guess), but watching Ambrose's increasing state of confusion, hurt, etc., while Niamh blithely pursued a man that had taken her fancy was painful to watch. I won't even go into how much I despised what happened in season six when they solved the problem in a totally unrealistic and unsatisfying way. I loved and enjoyed Ballyk from season one to it's ultimate end but the whole Niamh/Ambrose/Sean debacle is what keeps it from being five star all the way."
3,Jumped the shark,"This is the season where BallyK jumped the shark. The first three seasons were pure delight with well developed characters who had emotional complexity and depth. This season added a number of younger characters who were drawn very lightly. The original cast did their best to keep the charm, but it was lost. Still better than most American TV."
5,"Bring on Series 5 and 6, please!","Series 4 might be different than Series 1-3-but it's still worth watching. I agree with another reviewer-if you can see past Series 1-3 and the loss of Assumpta Fitzgerald and Fr. Peter Clifford, you'll enjoy Series 4 very much so.I love Niamh and everything she goes through in this series. It's much darker than Series 1-3 but with added cast of Sean and Emma Dillon, Danny Byrne (Eamonn's nephew), and Fr. Aidan and his sister Orla-you can bet it's not boring!I say on with Series 5 and 6 on DVD. I'm looking forward to both sets for my Ballyk collection."
3,Tough transitions,"The fourth season of Ballykissangel brings some unwelcome (at least to me) changes in the cast and the direction of the show. This is typical of many TV dramas, I think, as plot lines thin, and actors demand change in their roles. I don't want to be more specific because of the spoiler issues, but I liked the earlier seasons significantly more and can understand why the show went off the air after season 6."
4,Still Good with New Characters,Managed to keep the series interesting after losing major characters at the end of Season 3. Good stories and mixture of drama and comedy.
2,Collect the plate series instead.,"The main attraction of this volume is the reproduction of the plates by Jack Girbal which were originally published during the 1960's and 1970's by Dr. Hourtoulle. As the volume is in French, the ultimate value of the volume rises or falls based upon the quality of the reproduction of the various uniform plates.Alas, the reproductions are poor. The washed out and fuzzy colors reproduced in this volume bear little resemblance to the marvelous vibrant originals which were hand finished by Girbal & Cie. Additionally, and mercifully, the series is not reproduced in its entirety which totalled 89 plates.Save your money for wiser purchase."
1,wrong product sent,"Well, I love the product and really wanted the starfruit scent and received the plain coconut one instead,Disappointment doesn't describe my thoughts. It was a Christmas present.My absolute fav is the pineapple but wasn't available. Good product - just not the plain coconut scent."
1,Pedometer is worthless/ CD is ok,The pedometer is cheap and keeps turning off while i am walking and doesnt record anything. The cd is good but I gave the pedometer to my son to play with. Dont waste the money
1,Didn't work at all,"Plain and simple-- no matter what we did to adjust the unit, it never came close to recording the number of steps taken. Piece of junk. But what did I expect for $5?"
5,This is an excellent tool for any football coach!,"I would like to start off by saying that I am the Head Coach for the Lake City Stars. We are a Semi-Professional Football team playing in the Empire Football League. What this book offers is incredible. It lends different ideas and concepts from a variety of different coaches. I have been able to personally take many of the concepts that are in this book, and apply them to my own team. It focus' on the complete game of football, Offense, Defense, and Special Teams. It is a must for any coach who wants to establish a high amount of success in this extremely great game of football."
4,Beyond the X's and O's,"Of the numerous football guides I've read, this is the first book that actually went beyond the X's and O's of football. As the title says, it not only discusses the on-field game, but also preparation, team building, and the mental side of the game.This book touches interesting topics and is probably intended for giving some more food for thought and different angles on coaching issues. It is not exactly a DIY-manual or a literal step-by-step gude for all football coaches on how to build a successful team.While some of the chapters are a bit academic and subject to cross your personal views, this book is a recommended especially for those who are just starting their coaching career or coach youth and junior football."
4,Great insight to a coaches' strategy,"Although this book is a bit outdated, it has fabulous explainations to the inside of the game. Every defense/offense at any level of competitive football has their own ways of using formations and schemes. I am not a coach. I am a Sports Business major, and wanted to increase my knowledge of football so I can enjoy my favorite sport even more.Advice....if you're under the age of 30 or so, some of this will not compute in your football mind. The terminology is different than today, but the blueprint is pretty much the same."
4,pretty good,"This bibs are pretty good. I love the pop over bibs and for some reason there are not very many made like the velcro kinds.These bibs do the job, my only complaint is that they are alittle on the thin side, and the design is boring in my opinion. I like funny sayings and such."
3,Decent product,"Overall, I liked the ease of popping the bib over my son's head. I think the product could be better if there was some sort of waterproof material underneath the bib so that no liquids soaked through."
5,An excellent selection of important female artists,"As a long-time fan of Ani DiFranco, I was thrilled to find this rocking, live version of ""Cradle and All"". I didn't know any of the other artists, but soon grew to love them. This has become one of those albums I can't live without! The CD includes quite a few up-and-comers, all of whom I hope begin gaining the widespread attention they deserve. Most of the songs have a folk edge to them, but a couple break the mold. The songs tend to not be overtly political, focusing mostly on stories of things that happen to women. Many of these stories will ring a familiar chord. If you are a fan of contemporary women's music and are looking to expand your horizons, this album is the perfect starting point!"
3,3.5 Stars,"Overall, this is a really good CD with some excellent songs. I just received it about a week ago, and have listened to it several times since. With the exception of the Toni Childs song (incredibly annoying) and the Ani DiFranco song (I realize there are a lot of her fans out there and she has a wonderful voice and some great lyrics, but I have a hard time listening to her since she choses so many (annoying) singing styles throughout one song). I think there are better Putumayo CDs out there with a lot of the same artists - but overall this rates a 3.5 star with me. Just my opinion."
4,Beam torque wrench,"Low in-lb torque wrench, good quality, and very fast shipping.I used it for measuring the rotating torque when rebuilding a car differential."
1,deffective had to return to seller,"torque needle pointer not on center like it is supposed to be, returned to seller"
5,Nice tool,"Mine as everyone elses, pointer was off slightly, not a big deal to me though. It works great, i bought it to measure turning torque for setting up ring and pinions. wouldnt hesitate to buy another on."
5,Fascinating,"Really fascinating book! It fits perfectly with the place I am in, in my life right now. I have been so courageous in some areas of my life, and yet I still feel crippled by fear and unable to move forward in others. I just started reading today and am already on page 62. I am going to read through it all and then go back and read it again and do all the exercises. I look forward to all I am learning about myself and about breaking through the barriers that are holding me back in my life. I am grateful to the authors for taking the time to write a book to help people like me become the courageous person I know I am inside, on the outside in all aspects of my life."
3,Not good for a double basin sink,"I have this colander at home. While the holes are large enough for water to drain easily, the handle is a real drawback for me.The product literature claims you can wrap the handle around your sink. This might work well if you have a large sink, but the divider in my double basin sink means the colander can't sit level in the sink. Instead I have to rest the colander on the bottom of the sink.This colander is hard to store as well. The body of the colander is flat and wide, so it needs a large footprint of space. The handle makes it hard to stack.I still think this would be a good choice if you have a single basin sink and room enough to store it because the price is very good."
3,entertaining but biased,"This is a quick and engaging read and should be regarded as being more for entertainment than education. Anyone who has any prior knowledge on the subject will likely not get a whole lot out of it.My main issue with this book is the condescending nature with which the author regards previous eras. The author's bias serves only to perpetuate the degrading stereotypes that shape the many misconceptions of bygone centuries.I would say it's worth reading, has a sound structure, and quick pace, but lacks the detail and point of view that the subject matter demands."
4,The Adventures of Superman - The Complete First Two Seasons,"The series is ""dark"" and violent, with excellent acting from the supporting cast. Each episode was a movie in own right. Phyllis Coates is suburb, very much the independent modern 1950's woman a far better actress than the sub-servient Noell Neill. Phyllis exudes sex appeal. Jack Larson displayed better acting in this series that the latter, very much the innocent clean cut teenager. George Reeves acting improved in the 3rd season. Excellent historic 1950's American genre. The theme of ""Fighting for truth justice and the American Way"" is proclaimed, however there are elements in the ""American Way"" that are dark, voilent and lawless. The solution is that this aspect of American culture has to be crushed through violence and brute strenght by a handsome hero in disguise. An allegory that underneath all Americans is a hero waitng to surface and save teh world."
2,Teleavision Then,"This series is a time capsule it shows how TV was then, and gives you a nostalgic look at technical and creative programming. I saw this series when it came out in the 1950's as a child, and now as an adult. I was taken back to a different time in our country. The good and bad points of this series are irrelevant, look at it as people did then. I believe it can be vary entertaining, and enjoyable"
4,"A hot read, emotionally engaging","It was well-researched and fast-paced. I hope to see more like this, with real depth and emotional engagement with three dimensional characters."
3,Typical.,"The premise was interesting. However, it is practically thrown into the book without much credibility. The characters were far too extreme to be really believable. At times it seems the story was too quickly thrown together without enough foreplanning and with an explicit purpose to write about sex and seduction. But then again that is the point of romance."
2,Disappointing,"This book was very poorly done. (I almost said: It sucked, but that's not very polite.) It dragged on and on during the first and middle sections and then all of a sudden at the end, everything ended up ""fairy-tale wonderful"". Don't get me wrong - I LOVE fairy-tale wonderful! But this was so FAKE. During the last 10 pages, I uttered ""Oh, brother!"" and almost didn't finish it. But I did. This book had potential but did not reach it. No more Kat Martin for me..."
1,Smoke in the kitchen?,"This unit, and its 7"" sister share the same chassis (but with Coby logo) with the late, less than great, Polaroid FDM 0700A. The same Polaroid of infamous ""disappearing"" LCD screen fame. Did Coby correct the LCD problem? Maybe, maybe not, time will tell... Check out the web photos for both the Polaroid and the Coby. Is someone pulling a fast one here?"
3,Coby - Kitchen Monitor,"Product is good in general. However, the color resolution and picture crispness is inferior than anticipated."
3,Very Tight Fit,"I wish I could tell you how great this TV/DVD is. I struggled for an hour trying to install it. It isn't so easy. It would be a perfect fit for standard cabinets, HOWEVER, there's no room for the connections on the back. Be prepared to mount it so the face is 1/2"" beyond the cabinet face.When I finally got it installed and connected I discovered it was DOA (dead on arrival). The Amazon rep was very pleasant about paying for the return shipping. I will take a chance and order another -- assuming lightning won't strike twice.PS: The replacement is now installed and working fine. The extra 3"" of screen size improves the picture very much. The sound is not Bose, but what would you expect? Adding the FM antenna will require dismounting and reinstalling -- even with the extra 1/2""."
5,Absolutely LOVE it!,Definitely worth every penny - I LOVE it! The sound and picture are great - I love the revolving screen. One tip I would suggest is industrial velcroing the remote to the inside of a cabinet door because you would be lost without it! IT took about 2 hours for my husband to install. I reviewed pretty much every TV/DVD under the counter item on the market - this one defintely had the best reviews - I can see why!
4,BEST BUY FAR!,"After weeks of research and not many to choose from, I found a great price and gave this tv a try. Very delighted! Easy to install, decent size, quality picture (after adjusting color and tint) and sound are nice. The only quirk I can find is the volume. #2 seams to be too low and#3 is a little high but I'll deal with it........very satisfied!"
4,an excellent surprise,Never having heard of Coby we were hesitant to buy this TV but I must say we are delighted in its performance.
1,It didn't even last a day!,"I should have known better than to buy a Coby product again - I have replaced my handheld DVD player twice within a year.I plugged this unit in, and it seemed to run fine. When I got up the next morning, the unit was completely dead! Not even 24 hours later...could Coby get any worse?PLEASE - ANYONE OUT THERE READING THIS - DO NOT BUY COBY!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Neat little TV!!!,This LCD TV has a good clear picture. The picture becomes distorted when you move to the side of the screen. This is only when I'm close to the TV. I would buy it again if I was given the opportunity.
5,cleo fan,"As a buyer I always look for quaility. I have purchased from this seller many times and I have always been pleased with the items I buy. As a designer of jewelry I have to make sure that the items I use are real and not marred in any way. This particular fan always makes a lovely necklace,especially when I add some rose quartz beads. The delivery time is amazing as I never have had to wait for long before my order gets here. I highly recommend this seller and the items for sale,"
4,Some rare gems,"I was not a first generation Spike Jones, but I have to say this is pretty cool. This is the kind of music I used to dig on Tom and Jerry cartoons and just didn't know where to find it. This isn't a lot of the common novelty songs (Like Der Fuher's Face, Cocktails for Two.) But I think it's better because you get some things you wouldn't find elsewhere. Frantic Freeway, Powerhouse, and a really interesting version of the Nutrcracker Suite."
5,More Spike for outsiders,"A rare WELL DOCUMENTED compilation, that gives a pretty good idea of Spike's evolution, environment and ideas. Plus a couple of extremely rare ""unvollendete"" cuts! Not to miss, along with the ""Musical Depreciation Revue Anthology"". Yeah!"
4,"Lacks Quality, but fills its purpose.","Welp, have gotten the Gaming Seat home and assembled and it looks GREAT and it definitely does what it's supposed to. To be honest, it's a nice addition to my racing setup. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it just doesn't live up to it's steep price tag. For the money, it should just have a more rigid, higher density frame. Every time I get up from the chair, the metal arm that mounts the foot pedals to the seat flexes and knocks stuff over. Luckily I got it on sale for a mere $199, I seriously wouldn't recommend buying it for any more than that."
4,Needs adjustments,Loved the seat and the control section but it needs to have a better system for locking in control section. I am an adult of average size and the screw clamp just doesn't lock it in. As I apply pressure to the foot controls it slowly moves them away from me. I am going to drill some holes and use pins to keep it in place so that I can have some adjustment. As for the small cross piece would recommend it be wider and studier to keep it from moving. I will be adding something to it to strengthen it. That said with my few modifications it works great. I have 50 inch plasma that is right at eye level when I use the seat and it puts you right into the game.
3,Not COMPATABILE with G25 wheel/pedal set,"This was by far the least expensive seat available. It's comfortable enough, but I think the frame that the wheel attaches to needs to be stiffer.I have the G25 Logitech wheel. The foot pedal base is TOO LARGE to properly fit the angled platform that is built in to this gaming seat. I have had to 'rig' it up with other materials so that it can work. Also, unless you are going to keep the seat out all the time near your gaming system, it's awfully cumbersome to move around."
2,nice seat shame about the rest,"I spent more time trying to get my Logitech steering wheel to mount to the sub-millimeter thick plate they providethan the whole assembly.. I managed to find afew pieces of spare timber in my garage and create a sandwich ofwood to allow the generous Logitech clamps to work on the wafer thin shelf provided.In the ""instruction"" photo montage they provide they seem to think you can Velcro the wheel in place. Not this wheel my Chinese friends.The foot pedals are similarly ""secured"".. maybe the engineers at Play seats need to look at a real Logitech wheel and pedals and not someknock off ?Any way, all said and done I got the thing set up.. and I have to agree the support for the wheel does sway left and right when I am engrossed in racing.It's an OK seat for the money but the rest of it does not work too well.I'll probably keep the seat as is and build a frame from ply wood when I get time..At 99$ it would be worth it but for $199.. hmm.. not so sure."
4,I think it works fine with no issue's,"We bought 2 of these chairs, I think they work fine, they are pretty stable, everything mounts fine and stays put. The chairs after 3 hours of racing still feel comfortable. I think for the price they are worth it."
1,Worst thing to ever happen to video games,"The breakaway was a horrible idea. I don't know what Microsoft was thinking. These things always get lost, and the Xbox is so heavy that there's no reason to worry about the system being pulled off the table when cord gets yanked."
5,cable for xbox,I have been looking for a cable for my old xbox to play my old games. Thanks for the cable I am happy
4,Fatback Band CD,"CD is ok. I bought it for some particular tracks. Their most well known stuff is probably the best on the CD, remainder tracks were just ok."
1,Lexmark #33 print cart,"I received an after market refilled ink cart that didn't work at all. My #5250 printer wouldn't recognize it as the proper cart. Instead it said I installed wrong cartridge. Once open it also leaked so I threw it away. I got nothing but grief for my money. Seller said just return it. With it leaking that wasn't practical. Thanks, Bill"
4,Photo Ink,Most of the stores in my area have stopped carrying most of the ink I use so I had to find another way to purchase the ink I need. Amazon has very good prices and is easy to work with.
1,magenta color gone in half full catridge,"I don;t use the printer very often, but at this time I needed very much for printing photographs for my art projects. The catridge was half full when the magenta color stoped showing up in the prints. Which is very sad-only yellow and blue was printed, and black.., because I could not only print in b/w and while painting..running often to see the photos on computer..lol..I would never buy from the seller. I am not sure that it was reburbished or original..it doesn't matter-it has to work to the emptiness.(("
5,Lexmark #33 Color Cartridge Refurb.,"I am very pleased with purchase. Received shipment, installed in printer, works as well as a new one. Item arrived in very good condition."
1,Could not use this item!!!!,I replaced this filter a few months after ordered when my current color cartridge ran out. It colors everything green! I can not use this at all! It is too late to return it but maybe this will help anyone else that is thinking about this seller!! Don't waste your money here!!!!
2,Lexmark Ink #33,This Ink came not fixing my all - in -one printer rigth. It kept saying cartirige in correct and I know i put in right. thank .
2,The ink bled,"When I tried to use two of the cartridges, the color blue bled on all of the pages I printed."
3,lexmark 33,Worked ok I bought this to print some of my pictures at home.I wasn't that crazy about they way they turned out the colors were not that strong and the cartridge didnt seem to last as long as l would have hoped for.I cant say for sure if it was just the cartridges fault or maybe my lexmark printer it self.so I wouldnt give this a total thumbs up or down just somewhere in the middle to be fair.
3,ink,"good, i think there is cheaper out there, but my old lexmark leaves me with kimited choices- Considering all, though, this was the best price, quality as promised"
2,not worth the trouble,I did not get much use of this cartridge. I will never purchase an ink cartridge on line again.
5,Home Business,"The Lexmark #33 ink cartridge was excellent and delivery was fast, will order again from Amazon."
5,cartridge,It's just what I need for the lowest price you can find.Even walmart doesn't sell them this cheap.
4,"A powerful, albeit circumstantial, case","I disagree with Jay Freeman's assessment of this book. The author meticulously reconstructs Cromwell's last days and reveals the royalist Dr. Bate's account as a tissue of lies and misrepresentations. While the verdict might well be a Scotch one (that is, ""not proven""), McMains makes a strong if not absolutely convincing case for poisoning."
2,Pretty darn bad,"Look, I like formula mystery. Its nice that you know what the playing field is in a Nero Wolf.But Agatha Rasin take it to absurd levels. This is the almost *the same book* as ""The Haunted House"". New neighbor; she is grumpy and aloof from him; the get closer; a series of misunderstandings retards their relationship. The books replay the same relationship with the police and with Agatha's other neighbors.The plot is paper thin, so you cant read this series for that. The Agatha character is amusing and new, but for god's sake the author cant simply retread the same actions and dialogue in every book.Not worth reading, unless you are on a plane trip."
2,Nothing new here.,"I really anticipated reading this new title because I liked the others in the Agatha Raisin series so much, but I soon became bored with the story. The same old format: learn about a murder-decide to solve it-interview everyone-interview them again-interview them again-eat lunch at the pub-interview them all one more time-solve murder case just didn't grab me this time. There were a few funny and cute moments as there usually are in this series, but not enough to hold my interest. Agatha herself was in fine form, but the story was not, IMHO."
4,"New Places, New Faces","Agatha Raisin is up to her old tricks. Despite her failures at the game of love, she still has a keen eye for investigation ! This story takes us to some new locations, and the author provides a descriptive journey. It was fun to meet a new cast of characters as well.It is typical Agatha, some may find her quirks annoying, I find them endearing. The series is kept fresh with new locations & new characters for Agatha to play off of."
3,agatha Raisin,Started from the 1st story and read half of the series. Became disenchanted with the herione - a real bore.Will not continue with the series.
3,Plot vs. Chracter,"One does not read Ms. Beaton for ingenious plotting (sadly), but to spend time with her semi-dysfunctional, highly amusing characters (happily). One must overlook dramatic contrivances, and if you can do so, you'll be rewarded with a quick, addictive read."
3,My first and maybe last M.C. Beaton book,"I went to my library looking for some escapist literature. This book was on the table with other recent mysteries. Had just heard of this author, but had never read any of her books.Was disappointed. I don't care about Agatha Raisin and only finished the book to find out whodunit.I don't know if I'll read any of her other books in this series."
1,They just keep getting worse...,"This series has been going downhill for ages, but this latest is truly the worst..what a preposterous book! Read at your own peril!"
3,They send me a diferent model...,They send me the 501HDV Bogen - Manfrotto 501HDV Pro Video Fluid Head with Quick Release - Supports 13.2 lbs instead of the old 501 model like the description and image you see in the page... Ok is and good head but the reason to buy from here and not in another place was to have the old model..Gonzalo
1,It is NOT a HOW-TO manual,"At the cover, it wrote 'The complete HOW-TO modelling guide' is misleading. I was very disappointed when I read the book. It is more of a product catalog rather than a how to.I will not recommend this book to anyone. If you are serious in a good 'HOW-TO' book, search for this book 'Modelling Waffen-SS Figures (Osprey Modelling) by Calvin Tan'. It is comprehensive guide to figure painting. At the same time, knowing the author himself the person is a pro."
1,disappointment,"I was disappointed in the book Keep the Faith by Cynthia Earley. Being a fellow citizen of Charlotte, NC I was anxious to read it. However, from a literary standpoint, it was very poorly written. There were even common grammatical mistakes which are not unusual when the writer is quoting a character. But the main storyline had common errors.The graphic descriptions were violent, and the mild cursing might offend some Christian readers.The principle message of the book was good ""Keep the Faith"". But that phrase was repeated over and over to the point of being redunant rather than being effective. The message is biblical and true though. Keeping the faith throughout trials and tribulations is a good message to convey."
4,FAST CAR!!! BATTERY EATER!!!,"This car is awesome!!!!I bought two for Christmas, one for my 9year old, one for my 6 year old. They love them. My wife and I want one also because they are so cool. They handle all terrains very well. It is cool how they have mini channels so you can operate multiple of them at once with no cross talk.The only PROBLEM is they eat battery fast. The TYCO FLEX PACK is a neat battery but we get about 20-25 minutes out of one charge. That does not seem long. I called TYCO support and that is a normal run time for these cars so buy two batteries if you want more fun time."
1,Typical liberal rhetoric.,"I first read passages from this book in college. I can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds. Professor Zinn is a far left author. He uses the usual lines: America generally bad, communism generally good. Obviously Mr. Zinn has the right to write whatever he wants, and his writing style is very convincing. However, if the reader investigates the facts, many holes become visible in his theories. Those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints. A good example is ""Intellectual Morons : How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas by Daniel J. Flynn"" which gives the reader a good profile of Mr. Zinn."
1,Utterly useless,"This has to be the worst pet grooming product ever. You will be better off with a pine cone on a stick. The brush is bulky, and its falsely advertised as silent - it emits a high pitched squeel that frightened both of my cats at first. It didn't work on my short haired cat because the bristles are spread too far apart. Then I tried my luck on a long haired cat, and at first the battery cover on the handle kept falling off, and 7 bristles broke off within minutes of using the brush!!! I'm not quite sure the 'ionic' feature works either. After brushing each cat for at least 5 minutes, I didn't notice any difference in cleanliness or texture of the cats' furs."
1,Useless,I purchased this product and used it on my Alaskan Malamute/Shephard Mix and it was utterly useless. Big waste of time and money. Don't bother.
4,Comparable to more expensive filters,"I tend to stay away from filters 30 dollars or less, but thought I would give this one a shot. It looks and feels well built and performs well on both zooms and prime lenses. I usually go with higher end tiffen filters (the digital ht line), but ended up being really happy with this. It has become a semi-permanent filter on the kit lens that came with my camera. Note that this does not come with a protective case, so have one handy.I'd recommend this for lenses in the price range of 300 to 500 dollars. Anything above that, I'd highly recommend checking out the tiffen digital ht line. They are a bit pricey, but nothing matches them for durability and performance."
4,satifying!,"This product has good quality and feels solid. When it arrives, it does not have any scratches, cracks or bubbles. It works well with my kit lens, and I feel satisfied for what I paid for!"
4,Great filter & protector (with a few things to note),"I got this mainly because I wanted a lens protector that wouldn't interfere with the picture-taking on my new DSLR. It works great as a filter and protector and I would highly recommend it. I just have two things to note about it: (1) As other reviewers noted, it's REALLY hard to clean, so try to not get your fingerprints on it or you'll be spending the next half an hour or more cleaning it. (2) I don't know if it was just the one I got, but it took me forever to finally get it on my lens correctly because the threading just wouldn't line up. My husband said that it probably just wasn't made for my camera (Canon Rebel T1i) and even suggested returning it and getting another filter, but I was persistent enough that I finally got it lined up *just right* and it went on perfectly once you get it--it's just hard to find. Otherwise, I have no real complaints about this fine product and would recommend it to anyone!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm afraid I have to agree with the majority this time... I'm a true-crime buff, and I found this book to be somewhere between 'mediocre' and 'disappointing'. While the story was interesting, it was not very well written, and it was definitely lacking in depth. The reader is left wondering what really happened the night of the murder, because the killing itself is barely touched upon. Also, I did not get any sense of ""getting to know"" the characters -- not any of them. The last third of the book was downright boring, and the reader is left with many questions. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,READ IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE THERE...,"Interesting book in the beginning, but grows very dull & boring half way through. I believe the author hung himself with to many facts and chapters about the legal system and not enough facts about the murder. I couldn't even finish the book."
2,Majority Rules With Thumbs Down For This Book,"While reading this true crime book, I couldn't decide if I was reading about an actual crime or being given a textbook lesson on satanism and how teens become involved in the occult.Information about the crime itself was interesting, but provided little detail about what actually occured. Readers were given a summarized account of what occured on the night of Elyse Pahler's murder. The rest of the book was devoted to the deceased's friends and their thoughts; the teenager murderers legal wranglings; and in depth information about the occult. I found the latter two accounts to be extremely repeatitive and boring.Lastly, why was this book written before Royce Casey's sentenced was issued? The one defendant who stood to be punished the harshest despite that he solved an unsolvable crime for police. Guess I'll have to search Google for that information."
3,I knew Jacob Delashmutt,"I knew Jacob as a young boy as I dated his older sister for three years. He seemed odd to me then but I was shocked to hear the news of his crimes. The book is an interesting read even though it was poorly written and had inaccurate descriptions of the community. Arroyo Grande is a sleepy bedroom and farming town, mostly free of serious crime, with clean air, and good people."
2,Lack of info / inaccuracies,"I grew up in the town where this murder took place and went to school with the people involved. I had met one of the killers a couple of times as our mothers were good friends. All the boys pleaded guilty and therefore there was no trial. I think that is why there is such a dearth of information on this case -- no trial means no public transcripts of the prosecution's explanation of what happened. I only read a few pages of this book. I do not agree with the way it described the town I live in, the high school I attended, or the murder itself. This author goes for sensationalism rather than fact. I had considered buying this book to learn more details of the murder, but I can tell you after a quick skim that you will learn more from a few google searches than you will from this book."
1,I Weep...,"for the trees wasted to print this book. It was horribly written and an insult to decent Satanists everywhere. During the 2 or 3 days it took me to finish it, as I moaned about the awefulness, I had my boyfriend ask me more than once ""Why don't you just stop reading it?"" Indeed, why didn't I. My only consolation is that I didn't pay for it."
5,This is a wonderful but tragic story. You must read it,This story has touched my heart very deeply. It is very detailed. One of the best true crime stories that I have ever read. If you have the time you must read it!!!!!
2,A disappointment,"Well, the story is a good one: three teenagers in a death metal band kill a fellow classmate, presumably to ""see what it's like."" However, the writing style is geared to thirteen-year-olds. The text is replete with one-or-two-sentence paragraphs, and is stuffed with inane quotes from friends of the victim like, ""We really miss her."" Or lawyers will inform us that ""everybody deserves a fair trial."" Things like that.No effort is made to understand how kids could do something like this. All in all, a poor effort."
1,""" In the Name of Mercy!!!!!""","I have never written a review before but I feel like it is my civic duty in this case, so no one else will buy this book. I agree with the rest of the reviews. It is a story that had alot of potential but it was unorganized, poorly written and extremely repetitive, did I mention poorly written? I am a true crime buff too, and the only crime here was that I bought this book and wasted hours of my life that I will never get back. ..."
3,"Not from ""England""","This product was actually produced in Ireland, not England. It doesn't have the same texture/flavour as one from the Birmingham factory. Please take of ""England"" from the description."
3,Not bad for what it is,"Snagged a Caplet today. It's a little bulkier than the Coleco/Sega unit, but otherwise looks very similar, down to the bright, sharp screen, the AV out capabilities, and the 3 AAA batteries needed to run it. Space Invaders is an improved arcade classic. Bust-A-Move seems to be a port of something with SNES-like resolution. Burgertime is a remake, definitely not an emulation of something we've seen before. The original games, which I've only tasted, are bright, colorful, and easy to control. There is a decent mix of puzzle, breakout-style, 2D and 3D racing, maze games, and platformesque run-n-jumps. Not a bad little toy for the price if you appreciate the retro style -- just over a dollar per game."
2,Galileo: A Life,"If you are looking for a biography that discusses Galileo's scientific work, you will be disappointed. Reston must, of course, mention this great thinker's discoveries, but that is as far as it goes. There is little about the influence of his discoveries on the scientific community or how it shaped the world afterwards. I would have expected this to be one of the central themes considering the subject of this biography. The book deals almost exclusively with Galileo's struggles with the church. It is obvious that Reston has no scientific background. He should have picked someone else to write about."
5,Great addition to Galileo library,"If you already know something about Galileo, this book will be a wonderful addition to your knowledge base. If you are a newcomer, this book is a good introduction, but it will leave you wishing you knew more about his experimental method, his scientific writing, and his inventions. This book places Galileo in the context of his time and place -- and showing how he influenced his era (and eras after) -- and it also leaves you wanting a more traditional biography that tells you more about what Galileo did."
4,A well written and interesting biography,I read this book while visiting Florence and Rome this summer and the descriptions of Galileo's life in Renaissance Italy greatly enhanced the experience of that visit. It is an accessable account of Galileo's life for the general reader that for me captured the essence of the man.
3,ok,"This product is okay, if you want something for a project. After I got it decided it would make a nice project to paint for father and daughter."
1,More like an insect feeder,I loved this feeder when I got it because it looked exceptional and has the little roof to keep the rain from deluting the nectar but...it leaked from day one so much I had to take it down. No matter what I did it still leaked. When I would bring it in to refill I would find earwigs and ants in it and it was attracting Yellow Jackets constantly and they were chasing my hummers away. It is a shame I can't use it because it is so nice looking but my hummers didn't think so because they don't like sharing their nectar with all the bees and other insects it attracted. I would have returned it but I didn't want to pay the return shipping.
1,"Cheap, barely held together, and LEAKS","Amazon, shame for selling this. Shame on me for not realizing I would get what I paid for. This feeder looks great in the photo, but it a real piece of junk when you open the shipping box. It doesn't even come IN a box of its own. Held together with incompletely ""shot"" staples, nothing is aligned properly. And worst of all, the plastic parts of the bottle and feeding flowers don't fit together, so it leaks sugar water all over my patio. Try something else, folks. Don't be mislead by its attractive appearance."
1,Jack Falt,I gave this only one star because I have tried to order it twice and ended up with the 1999 version (same picture). I'll be glad to upgrade my review when I get a copy of the new version.St. Margarethen has an annual opera they show in a vast outdoor theatre. They show a different opera each year. They produced Aida in 2004 with actual elephants in the grand march. In 2005 they produced Carmen. Last summer in 2006 they did a remake of Die Zauberflote for the Mozart anniversary. I have yet to see it. The other two were quite spectacular. The 1999 version of Die Zauberflote was quite spectacular too but it was only excepts with no subtitles.I am still awaiting the 2006 version.
2,A disappointment,"This book degenerates into Posner taking political potshots at Democrats while portraying Republicans and Starr as the saviors of the free world. Posner makes me wonder whether he could be an unbiased judge. I'd hate to be a Democrat before his court. How he got the reputation as a fine jurist is beyond this reader. I think Posner's goal with this book is to generate interest in getting him nominated for the Supreme Court should a Republican get elected President. But by suggesting that Nixon should not have faced impeachment, I think he goes off the deep end. For anyone interested in an unbiased look at impeachment (written prior to the Clinton affair), read Gerhardt's The Federal Impeachment Process. Posner relies on it himself and is strongest when he does."
3,"Not terrible, but presents opinions as facts","The book corrects a number of legal errors which have been made by Clinton supporters and foes. But it often states opinions as facts. Sometimes it misstates facts.For example, Posner concluded (beyond a reasonable doubt) that Clinton perjured himself when he dined a sexual encounter with Kathleen Willey. He presents no analysis for this and many other conclusions.He demonstrates political ignorance. He should know that when the House Managers decided to call Sidney Blumenthal instead of Betty Currie, they had given up on conviction and were trying to damage Clinton politically. That was not a mistake; they calculated properly."
1,Before you read this book....,"When I read this book, something about it made me uncomfortable. While it is easy to become numb to yet another diatribe against Clinton (which is what this book mostly is), Posner's harshly negative tome, dressed up in pedantic legalese, seemed a bit over the top. Still, I couldn't put my finger on what was so disturbing about the book. Then I read the March 9 issue of the New York Review of Books (nybooks.com), which includes an incredibly insighful review of Posner's book by Ronald Dworkin, a legal scholar on par with Posner. All I can say is: read Dworkin's absolute destruction of this book. Posner may be one of great legal minds of our day, but, as Dowrkin makes clear, this book cannot be taken seriously. It is nothing more than far-right, anti-Clinton nonsense dressed up in legal language. Thank you, Ronald Dworkin, for exposing Posner's book for the sham and joke that it is."
2,Deceptively Marketed as Non-Partisan,"The author is disinterested in whether or not Kenneth Starr leaked grand jury information, terming the question inconsequential. But grand jury leaking is a felony.The author thus dismisses the relevance of whether Starr committed felonies. Too bad. It could have been a better book if the author was more responsive to concerns other than his own about President Clinton."
1,Sour grapes.,Facts are facts. He was not convicted. I have not seen anything that said lying in a civil trial is a high crime. Posner should admit he hates Clinton. I do not like some of the things he has done. But there was no impeachable offense. The last impeachable offense was can the Iran-Contra Scandal. Why do you not focus your energy on that obvious breaking of the law. There is a lot of opinions presented as facts in this case. There is a lot of ignorance on political strategy in this book. It does not even make a good read on the toilet. More real facts less opinion. And face it you are mad because he was not ousted.
3,A fairly dispassionate analysis of a most divisive subject,"As someone who actively rooted for the embarrassment of Clinton's enemies last year, I would just like to take issue with those labelling Judge Posner's work a hatchet job on Clinton. Judge Posner's feelings about Clinton are readily apparent, but he should not be faulted for his humanity--there is just no such thing as complete objectivity in a thinking person. Posner reaches reasonable conclusions, ones that the facts were not contorted to fit. I diagree with many, if not most, of Judge Posner's analyses--this does not mean the book was ""partisan""; and it does not mean I would have been better off not reading it. I recommend it to all political junkies."
5,Fabulous story line and engaging southern charm to boot!,"Fabulous! I was looking for a fun and romantic read after several mind bending books and this book did not disappoint. The humour, delightful romantic tension and engaging characters drew me in instantly and carried me through the entire book. That being said, it is not without substance and it had the perfect tale one would want to spend a few hours with."
2,um?,"I'm a little surprised this book has gotten so many four-and-five-star reviews because the whole storyline seemed very choppy and underdeveloped to me. It's more of an old-school sort of romance novel I think, and the heroine seemed very weird to me (in a i'm-just-so-darn-naive sort of way, so much so, it was a little icky). I found myself just skimming through page after page because the whole thing was so blah. I say don't waste your time on this one, there's plenty of other better books out there!"
2,Did Not Finish,UGH - Definitely not my cup of tea. Just a cleaned up Bodice Ripper. Way too predictable and boring.............. Did not finish reading.
3,Mildly Entertaining If You Like Cheesy Romance Novels,"Downloaded this when it was free for the Kindle and just got around to reading it this weekend. I like the idea of the town handyman wooing the new librarian on whom he's had a crush since high school, and though the main characters are likable, I found them just too unrealistic. I figured out the big secret pretty early on, and generally I'm not a fan of books where the romance takes place in only 2 weeks (as this one does). Also, the references to appearance, clothing, and technology really date this book. I'm shocked that it was published in 2009; it seems more like 1999! Very easy read if you are in the mood for a cheesy romance in a small town."
3,I was not blown away,"Josie Allen, the town librarian, and Cole Craig, the town handyman, move beyond the town's disapproval of her dating someone from the wrong side of the rigde and become a couple. It is a very light read with no romance scenes other than kissing- which is not necessarily a bad thing, just FYI. I was a little confused at the change in Cole Craig from one scene to another- one moment he seemed almost like the village idiot with little ability to speak correctly, and in the next he was speaking in very well educated tones and sentences. The novel also seemed to end fairly quickly. I was hoping for more of a chance for Josie and Cole to get to know each other after she discovers his true identity."
3,"Cute, but Predictable","I can't help flashing back to different movies when I am reading some of these books. This one reminded of ""Hope Floats"" or ""Sweet Home Alabama"" Don't get me wrong, they are heart warming and cute, but so predictable. Beautiful girl returns to small hometown, falls for down home gentleman, all is forgotten and they live happily ever after...then I get back to the real world, married 9 years, kids, pets, bills...I guess it is nice to spend a day in these stories."
3,Enjoyable Light Romance,"This was an enjoyable book. I liked the characters, but I really did want some more interaction between the hero & heroine after Cole's big secret was disclosed. The character of Dixie was fun and I would enjoy seeing her in later books.I got this book when it was a reduced price, and I have to say that I had to take away a star due to the reg price of $8.59. I know that I would have missed out on this fun read at that price."
5,So Cute,This was a great easy read that held me captive til the very end and I didnt want it to stop. It was a sappy love story but you need those every now and then. great book I would read more from this author.
3,Average,"Dr Josie Allen has just finished her doctorate and comes back home to a small Tennesee town to head the library. Cole Craig, from the wrong side of the tracks, is the town's handyman. Both characters meet town's expectations (low or hight) while falling in love.The plot is thin but sweet at times, with childhood memories echoing curent events.Some situations or characters are not very believable. All in all, no more than OK."
5,Only you,"A very well written book, with showing the writer put in a lot of research of the area, and added exciting fiction to give it a good moral value, something we do not experience in all books."
2,Anyone who supports this no-talent is quite delusional. 1.7 stars.,"I hate people like T-Pain. No talent, not a good songwriting bone in their body and He's one of the (if not THE) ugliest ""R&B-Rap;"" artists in the game.I HATE You T-Pain. You couldn't write a decent song if it hit You upside You're ugly azz head.People who listen to this rubbish are the same who have 3 kids by the age of 18 and think that this is really music.I guess no-talents are in these days.Vocals: 1.5/5Vocal Emotion: .5/5Songwriting: 2/5Music & Beats: 2/5Cover Art: 2.75/5Substance: 3/10 (I Got It & the following track are the only ones that try and save this P.O.S. album)1.7 stars.Overall: F+"
4,MANY REALLY GOOD songs on this CD,"It's not perfect, although VERY few albums are. For a mainstream album to have a song as serious as Suicide that directly discusses HIV/AIDS it's amazing! Backseat Action and Put It Down are two sexy songs and whether he meant it to be or not Yo Stomach is hilarious. I suggested everyone I talk to go buy the CD for those songs not for the radio songs (Bartender and Buy You A drink - which are good dance songs). Also, I think I liked all of the songs on the album but Buy You A Drink and that is because it has been PLAYED to H3LL and back on the radio.ALSO Church comes HARD (the second song on the CD)!If a person gave this CD a rating lower than 3 they are not really into Hip-Hop/R&B; so I would not suggest anyone who is into Hip-Hop/R&B; take their advise!!!"
4,It'z good give him credit,"I personally liked the album. He had a song which he sang without the auto-tune which was called Right Hand and I thought he did a good job on the song and it proves he can really sing. Top 5 tracks Right Hand, Tipsy, Bar Tender, Buy U A Drank and Backseat Action"
1,"T-Pain's ""Epiphany"" missed its mark","The first time I heard, T-Pain's ""I'm in Love with a Stripper"", I must admit that I was drawn to the song which surprised me. While the lyrics weren't relatable in my world, I think his use of a vocoder (first introduced by Zapp & Roger) reintroduced a sound that I favored from long ago. That being said, I figured I would listen to him only in the confines of my car or club. However, by the time his second album (Epiphany) was released, some really good advertisers convinced me to purchase it.After listening to the album a couple of times, I knew that my purchase was in vain and pointless. The only songs I may play from time to time are: Bartender, Put it Down, and Buy U a Drank. After this hard-learned lesson, T-Pain will remain a radio/club artist in my book."
2,Tremendous let down! Don't waste your money.,"I'm a music fan, plain and simple. So, when I heard T-Pain's unique style I was feeling it. ""Buy U A Drank"" was off the hook and when he followed it up with ""Bartender"" I was convinced that I needed this album. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! Those were the only two good songs on the album, with the exception of ""69"" featuring J Lyriq. It was like the brother had tried a bit too hard. That and most of the songs sound way too similar. A little bit of content as far as lyrics go wouldn't hurt either. Bottom line is that I would have been better off, hopping on iTunes and downloading those 3 songs rather than subjecting my ears to that tragedy in CD form. Better luck next time. 1.5 stars"
1,Another whiner!,"As I have said about my review about Akon's latest record...this dude is worse. ""Buy You A Drank!"" I mean come on........I wish I can approach a chick and just say those words and then she give me the time or day. Come on! Another f**ked up record. I saw the video on Fuse, and I could not stomach any of it. Dude you look Stevie Wonder look bad!"
5,Epiphany,T-PAIN'S SECOND ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER. GREAT ALBUM IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GO GET IT.
2,disappointed,"The CD worked for a day or two, then when I tried to play it a few days later it wouldnt play a few of the songs."
1,Testical-Pain,Should be the unabridged name of this artist. One listen you'll feel it too. Roger Troutman would be ashamed.
3,I'll take a drink over this album anyday!,I only bought this album for the hit single Buy you a drink. And its funny because thats the only jammin' song on there ! Thank God I bought it bootleg for 3 bucks because its not worth the retail price!( Yeah Yeah I know alot of people may look down on others that buy or sell bootleg copies of cd's but hey if the artist only drops one hot single and nothing else what can you expect! Im sure as hell not gonna chance all my money for a cd that dont jam!)
1,Not all cheese flicks are watchable again,"Megaforce was shown on cable tv constantly durring the mid '80s in a vain effort to fill up airtime in the afternoon for kids. While I am sure the people behind the film believed they were making a decent action film for kids, the acting is hyperactive, sappy and bad and would never convince a kid of any age.Lots of folks love this film just because it IS that bad....and maybe one of the worst every made. Bad as it is, I could never watch it again."
3,The best kind of cheese!,I love this hokey film. It was a basic action film with few plot surprises. That sad it is hard not to really enjoy the characters and the actors who played them. Even the bad guiy is wonderful. If you want explosions and 80's camp this is the film for you. If it were made today there would have to be a vidoe game. It views like a first person shooter.
3,Megaforce,"It is still the campy pic from the 80s, however the sound (voices) leave a lot to be desired. All of the voices are high pitched no matter what player that I play it on. It is still the only DVD of it around so what are you gonna do?"
2,Fun movie but DVD transfer not so good,"Normally I'd have given 3 to 3.5 stars for this, but I dinged it for technical reasonsMegaforce is a guilty pleasure from the 80s that is dumb MST3k fun. They were GI Joe before the GI Joe cartoons showed up. My biggest issue was the DVD transfer. The biggest issue was the dialogue was really hard to hear in many places. There was the occasional graphical glitch that flashed on the screen ever so briefly in about 2 or 3 instances. Finally this may be the result of a faulty memory of the movie, but the sound and video felt 'sped up' slightly. People's voices were higher pitched than I remember. Comparing to a another clip online I can hear a slight difference. Bottom line a bad but fun movie marred by a bad transfer"
4,The Ultimate in 80's Cheese Action,"This film, to put it quite simply, is a classic. An action/Adventure film set in the 1980's stars Barry Bostwick as the dashing(Now extremely laughable) Hunter, who leads a group of ethnically diverse freedom fighters known as the Megaforce. Neet-O looking vehicles, combined with some hilarious moments make this movie a cult hit waiting to happen. Though now in the 90's, this movie can only really be appreciated by those who enjoy 80's camp action films. If thats your type of flick, see this movie...if you can find a copy!"
5,dosn't have to be spectacular to be unforgetable,I remember seeing this in the theater when i was 8 years old and it is one of the few movies I constantly remember and want to see over and over. The bike shots are great and the vehicals are sweet looking. The acting is a bit off but it has a charm that a lot of those old 80's movies had and more. I have this movie on tape and plan to keep it in good condition to let my kids see what their old man thought was neat back when he was there age.
4,Mega force,"Been waiting a long time for this. Looks really good. The sound is a little fast, voices are a bit high. it was suggested that maybe since it was originally an ITC owned property that we are getting a Pal conversion and we are not getting the correct frame rate. All in all it's great to have it looking so good and well packaged. Wish it had extras like some of the other Hal Needham properties but it is what it is."
1,Lasting Impression,There are not many movies that I remember from the early 80's. This being one of them. That being said it is not a pleasent memory. This movie stands out for me as one of the worst movies I can ever recall seeing and I saw it when I was 11 or 12. Even at 12 I could not buy flying motorcycles. It ranks with another all time horrible movie called Sorcerous. I guess though if you are into watching rediculous old movies this would be for. Enjoy.
3,Back in the day...,"I remember loving this movie when it came out. Of course, I was only 11 at the time. I remember buying all the toys that came out from the movie."
1,what's that smell coming from? oh it's this stinker of a movie,"man my boys picked this one out of the 3 for $15 bin at a movie store so i got it,boy did i get it. some action scenes are so dark you can't see what's going on,which is ok because what you can see is stuff that won't keep the 6 to 10 year olds it was aimed at watching it for long. maybe fun in a camp kind of way but i don't think so."
2,"2 stars for audio issue, not for the film","I watched Megaforce last night and there is a definite sound issue. The film hasn't been sped up, the frame rate looks fine but all the sounds, music, voices, etc... sound like they have been pitched up or something. I've had an old VHS copy for many years and would catch it every once and a while when it was broadcast on cable back in the day. As soon as the opening narration started I could tell there was an issue. Hopefully Henstooth video is looking into this and will offer a disc swap. Other that this cheese-fest 80's guilty pleasure has never looked better. They did a great job on that, just need to fix this audio problem. Ace Hunter isn't supposed to sound like Alvin."
3,"Terrible, Wonderfully Terrible","This movie in 1982 was then a ""B"" movie. But just because it was a ""B"" movie does not mean it ain't good. Megaforce is no movie for critic's or people who can not suspend reality for fun.Megaforce is a fun movie that if you let it can entertain, make you laugh and evoke some imagination.However, for those who are critic's or realists it is NOT for you.My reccommendation is buy the movie and have a 90 minute break from reality and laugh till it hurts."
5,So bad that it's good...,"I purchased this movie because I remembered it from the 80s. It's just as bad as I remembered it being. I have to admit that it's a great movie to make fun of. It's fun to watch people watch it for the first time. As I said in the description, It's so bad that it's good."
5,excellent,I had a lot of fun reliving these adventures with Lucy. I remembered these episodes and would recommend this to everyone if they want to have a good time order this dvd set.
1,Not Good!,I bought this for my son's LG CU500 cell phone. The Kingston website hasthe Kingston 1 GB MicroSD memory card listed as compatable with my son's phone. It is NOT. I am out the money for this card and have had to go out and spend more money buying a different brand card. This card is a total waste and the Kingston website cannot be trusted to let a consumer know what products THEIR products can be used with.
5,Great Product,"This memory card has to be one of the best ones that I have ever used...All of the different options in which to use it make it invaluable. And, for the price you can't beat it!!!!"
5,"Great Product, Quick Delivery!",I would defintely recommend this vendor. The item was exactly what I wanted.
1,Save your money.,"simply stated doesn't work, if your lizard is sick take it to the vet this stuff won't do it, believe me I've lost a very nice lizard trying it."
1,Warning - Wrong Picture of Connectors for SP,"Warning - Wrong Picture of Connectors for SPI sold this item to a buyer that said it wouldn't work on her son's Game Boy and she was correct.The connectors are round on this item and the connectors are flat in the next generation SP.See the following correct listings to replace this item that contains both the car charger & plug in charger:Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance SP Rapid Car Charger with IC ChipSKQUE New! For Nintendo DS Gameboy Advance SP AC Power Cord"
1,Terrible source to review for Public Speaking,"The other DANTES review books may be good, but this one is completely useless. There are plenty of ball-busting questions, but virtually no review of the content. The book I used for the course I took was excellent, but it does not cover the material well enough to pass the exam. However, this book is good enough to show you how difficult the real exam will be. The key is to find the book that provides adequate review preparation for the exam. I have no idea which is the best book to prepare for the exam, but this one is not the one to buy."
1,Better of buying a Text book,This is not worth the money. if you want to self study you are better off buying the book that they use at your school. At least that way if you do not take the test you already have the book.
3,"Is a pointer, not the answers","These study guides provide pointers to materials that will be covered, but don't look to them to be the actual questions and answers. You should still research and study material."
5,Must have for Nursing Students,If you are a Nursing student this is a must have for Nursing school... Small enough to take to clinicals with you.
4,I like these meal bars.,"These are good to eat when you are short on time, or tempted to eat something much less healthful. They are good for a person with Type 2 Diabetes because they have a lower sugar content than other diet bars."
5,Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant.,"This book turns some poor thinking about God on its ear, arguing that much of what we've learned about God has come through some mistakes of the past that have had huge consequences in the present. Pinnock and Brow argue that we must take our understanding of God out of the courtroom where legalese and penal talk has made God remote and distant, and return speech about God to the family room where love and relationality are the proper bedrock of our understanding."
1,Does not work!,"I purchased 2 of these from Amazon soI would be able to use with differentchemicals for different applications.Neither one of them work! It says topump 15-20 times. Well, pump 100 timesand you may get one ""squirt"" out of it,then back to more exhausting pumpingon the plunger.Save your money, I tossed both in the trash.Would I recomment this product?NO!"
3,Perry Mason on DVD,"This series of DVDs is terrific. The recording is very clear and it is wonderful not to have to fast-forward through commercials. I cannot wait for the next set. If anyone is a fan of the old Perry Mason TV series, I strongly recommend this and Vol. 1. You will be hooked."
5,Perry Mason Season1Vol2,How great is it that you can now purchase older TV shows on DVD that the networks refuse to air anymore? Thanks so much for offering this great product in a wonderful boxed set for each season!
5,One of the best,"How could anyone not like Perry Mason. What else can I say? It is just one of the best shows ever. You can watch it again and again and still not remember the ending of an episode, making it new every time. It chronicles a time period that I would have liked to live in Los Angeles."
5,"Perry Mason Season One, Volumes 1 and 2","The season one episodes, most taken from full-length Earl Stanley Gardner novels. The editing here is some of the most skilllful I've ever seen. In cutting down a novel with a dozen or more auxiliary characters into a one-hour TV mystery with the standard three suspects, the writers managed to keep the flavor of the original stories. An excellent beginning to an excellent series."
5,"Perry Mason Season 1, Vol. 2","The first season of this series is fantastic, The themes and stories aregreat and varied, with a deal of humour and the courtroom action is classic. It is also interesting to see how women were treated and percieved in the late 1950's. The DVD is alsovalue for money with so many episodes. Can not wait for the second season to be released."
5,Perry Mason-Season 1 Vol. 2,"I am so happy to see these wonderful old shows being released on DVD. I do not watch the TV shows of today. I find them lacking talent, boring, cheap and a sad reflection of our times. In my opinion, wonderful shows like Perry Mason, represent TV at its finest. Great acting, great stars and wonderful writing. I recommend this set to anyone who loves vintage television. The transfers and sound are wonderful! Watching these great old shows bring back a time when life was simpler and we did not have to watch our fellow man eat bugs to get their 15 minutes of fame. I hope they release all seasons of Perry Mason. I also hope to see more of the wonderful old shows of the past."
5,"Well, it's Perry Mason, for gosh sakes...RAYMOND BURR!!!!","I mean, how could you go wrong? It's not real lawyering, it's not even logical or realistic most of the time, but it's romantic, dramatic, campy and fun. These are excellent transfers, and the occasional ones I've found to be a little grainy were, compared to tapes from TV showings, amazing. It also looks to me that everything originally shown is included, they're not chopped up from syndication, there are no ""EH?"" moments so far. So if you love Perry Mason, they're worth the money. (I've got Season 1 parts 1 and 2, and am champing at the bit for Season 2.)"
5,i love my perry,"perry mason - if you don't know him, you need to meet him. this is early courtroom drama at it's best. and an added bonus is if you like mid century decor - this show has it in spades! and ladies, check out paul drake... he's like the perfect 1950's man! and della street's clothes... oh my! treat yourself. watch perry and go back in time to the 1950's and 60's."
5,"Very cute, comfortable costume!","Very cute, comfortable costume! Our son, who was around 10 mos old at the time, wore this for Halloween & got lots of praise. He didn't care for the hat, which was a bit large so it kept falling off, but I liked how the smock-like costume fit over a sweatsuit & kept him warm in Oct."
3,Kinda disappointed,"We got many compliments with this costume, but when I received it Thomas' face was sewed crooked on the costume, and it I would have had the time to send it back before Halloween I would have."
4,Would have been better if he would wear it.,Our son loves trains so we thought he would like this. Costume looked good and was about the right size. Material was kinda cheap but I guess you only wear it one or two times. Couldn't get him to wear anything but the hat so we threw some overalls on him and he went as the conductor.
1,Not much new here,Bummer let-down. I didn't learn anything new from this. Good thing it was XMAS present.
3,Simple descriptions,"What are these and how can we model them? Rau gives a quick exposition of this fundamental economic idea. All the salient concepts, like the multiplier-accelerator model, floors and ceilings, are explained.The maths is simple and involves some time series equations and calculus, and concepts like monotonicity. Useful at the undergraduate level."
2,I'll Show You VIET NAM!!!,Wacko Dennis Hopper is in his full drugged out period when he made this movie. It is a train movie and Hopper is a PTSD combat vet coming home from Viet Nam to escort his dead buddies coffin to the funeral. He meets a colorful and very weird cast of charactes and of course he fits right in cause he is nuts and basically plays Dennis Hopper... which he normally does. This is not a great movie and I am not even sure a good one. But it is kind of interesting and if you are a fan of Hoppers give it a peak.
5,Nice but crazy pricing and no product support,"Seems to work well and compared to a Midtronics tester gives somewhat different results. Tend to think that it is more accurate. Argus responded to pre-sales questions but hasn't to post-sales ones. One of my question was why if one had the printer, battery temperature is listed on the print out but not if you don't. Odd since the info must be available.The price dropped eight times since I ordered it a month ago for a total of around $62. Yesterday the price increased $162! I've never seen this before on Amazon."
4,John Cage...Where to Start?,"For those interested in getting into John Cage for the first time, this is a great place to start. Getting into Cage can prove intimidating at first, but this great collection of prepared piano pieces will open the door to him. The music features some of Cage's solo piano music, performed by Stephen Drury. It closes with the track, ""Dream"", which is one of the better pieces in my own opinion. ""In a Landscape"", as a whole, accurately depicts his style, not only including his avant-garde approaches, but also the soft, gentle resonance that can be heard in many of his pieces for piano."
4,This is the same CD as Cascade,"The title of my review says it all. If you already have Cascade you don't need this one. If you don't, I highly recommend this to fans of Laraaji; calming, reflective music featuring Laraaji's inimitable zither playing. ""New Age"" music that doesn't sound limp or flaccid."
2,If I thought this was going to be a comedy I may have judged it differently,"I had this movie recommended to me by a friend as a good scary movie. Turned out to be neither thriller nor horror, but also not the mega-clever genre-bender that it was working so hard to be. At times it was mildly amusing and that's about all."
3,Best comedy I've seen this year!,This movie provided many more laughs than scares. The premise starts out ok but soon takes a left turn into stupidity.Oh well. Can't blame them for trying something different.
1,Worst Movie I've Ever seen,Ok seriously where are all these good reviews coming from? This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. Not even close. Just trust me and avoid this movie at all costs because it just isn't any good.
1,one of the worst movies ever made,"the script is terrible and the rest of the movie isnt much better. the movie isnt scary at all. in fact its so bad its comical at times, but thats definitely not intentional. flush your money down the toilet and it will be better spent. at least you wont waste the time in your life."
1,AWFUL,THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME TRUST ME DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY UNREAL IT WAS A BIG WASTE I GAVE IT ONE STAR AND I DONT KNOW WHY
3,"Decent movie, more crappy Amazon Prime delivery though","This movie is pretty good, quite violent, but entertaining and worth the watch. But once again, I have to say shame on Amazon for advertising this as an HD movie and not delivering it in full surround sound. I mean, c'mon! You're charging close to $7 for a single rental and I can't get better than stereo sound?! This is a ripoff in my view."
2,"If you don't like horror, skip it","Sorry, I disagree with all the rave reviews. I wanted to turn the film off halfway through, and should have. Yes, it's creative, and it is a unique idea, but ultimately, if you don't like the whole ""young people killed in dreadful ways"" genre, don't bother. Granted, it does go way beyond only killing off the young people; they must have exhausted Hollywood's supply of fake blood. I expected something other than ""just"" a horror movie, and will not be watching this again, or using the free digital copy."
2,Really,"I gave it two stars for one reason it was creative, but in my own opinion it was a very bad movie. They could have done so much with this idea, but they fell short of hitting the mark."
2,Felt like Season 6 of Lost,"The trailer looked different and the story appeared interesting. However, the ending was horrible. In most movies you have to suspend reality to some extent, but this movie went off the deep end. Was it a twist? Yes. It just wasn't something that was believable even though it was somewhat unique. I like horror/suspense movies but this one can be skipped. If it would have had a different ending, it could have been 3 or four stars. Like the Lost series, I felt jipped when it was over."
4,I liked it enough to buy it for my brother,I am too afraid to watch it myself. But I am very interested in it. Raad some good reviews. So he will watch it and tell me about it. It has a twist to it and is quite scarey.
5,Classic Horror,"A phenomenal film, with potential to become one of those cult classics.For horror movie buffs it tries to stick in as many horror movie references in as possible. I particularly liked the Evil Dead shout-outs. A dope, original film that will leave you wanting to review your old horror collection."
3,Not what you expect at all,Thought this was your typical scary movie. It has a different twist and it takes it to another level sci fi unrealistic events. Strange movie but not the worst I've seen.
5,Spooky beyond understanding,Needs to be watched again to REALLY understand what is going on.Need to listen and understand. NOT your typical horror film
3,It was entertaining!,"This movie was watchable and very entertaining. I didn't find it scary, but it had it's moments to be sure! I really enjoyed the movie. I expected more I think so I was slightly disappointed but on the whole I don't regret purchasing the movie and I will watch again."
4,The Cabin in the Woods,One of those good scary movies that aren't too gory or violent with a pretty good story line and a couple of famous faces.
4,"Not what you expect, Whedon at his best.",I wasn't sure how this movie be as if scary or cheesy. It turned out to be very smart and funny. Joss Whedon is at his best. The cast including the end camero is just awesome. I laughed and enjoyed myself with this movie. I love how Whedon casted Buffy and Angel members. Great film with an original plot that is totally Whedon. Everyone should check it out.
5,NOT WHAT YOU THINK!!,Amazing story with a one of a kind plot and very original idea!!!the last 20 minutes will blow your mind!!! love this movie!!!
5,Not your usual horror movie,"This movie surprised me. It appears at first to be a typical slasher movie, but it's not. I am not going to say much more. There will be NO spoilers in my review. I have to admit that I am a Joss Whedon fan, so anything with his name attached to it, I am guaranteed to watch. I love the way his mind works. If you don't like horror movies, don't bother with this one. If you love horror movies, this is a fun one with a unique twist. It's an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half."
4,"different, creative, good",Good different type of movie. Worth renting. Liked that it wasn't the same recycled story that you see so often.
4,Original Movie,Most of the time movies are similar in nature and they are not original. But this movie is different. The writer(s) of this movie put some thought in writing this movie and I am glad they did.
4,"A Short, Honest Review","If you're a horror film fan (maybe even a bit of a sci-fi fan as well), you will probably enjoy this film.The LESS you know about it going in...the BETTER it will be.Even if you don't end up liking it, you will at least find it interesting and appreciate its cleverness.That's all I'll say.Check it out."
5,Fantastic Movie,"The movie was great and it was delivered in a timely manner! Cabin in the Woods starts out like your basic horror film, but is so much more!"
3,Review of The Cabin in the woods,Good Horror flick a little bit over the top but movies today are just that way.. Good special effects with the monsters.. Good Stuff
5,Great Fun,"This is so much more than the traditional dead teenager movie; it is in a class of its own. A group of young people head off to a cabin in the woods to take a break from their studies; they make a pit stop at a gas station where they meet the obligatory creepy attendant who sputters incoherent admonitions and impertinent remarks. The hapless group continues to the cabin where they become puppets in a murder fest orchestrated by white-coated corporate types controlling the environment in which the killings occur. I won't give further details as not to spoil the fun, but suffice it to say that horror movie aficionados will especially appreciate the inside jokes and the surprise guest star at the end of the movie. Enjoy!"
4,Flips cliche on its head,"This movie should appeal to those who appreciate dark comedy. Great special effects, awesome monsters, and plot twists abound in this mock horror send-up."
4,A very good take on the horror genre,"I went to see ""The Cabin in the Woods"" with a bad attitude. From what little I had seen it seemed like yet another variation of the ""Friday the 13th"" slasher genre with a group of college aged students (played by less than great actors) going to spend a weekend in the woods in which there would be sex, pot smoking, and partying and of course there would be a strange force in the woods killing the youngsters one by one.Yes this element exists, but there is somuch more going on here. Think ""Friday the 13th"" meets ""The Truman Show"". The action that takes place in the woods is fun to watch but it's nothing compared to watching the action in a control room. Bradley Whitford and the always great Richard Jenkins make this movie a treat. And then of course there is the climax which is second to none. Awesome script, good laughs (all intentional), fun movie to watch.Peace."
2,This is NOT a good movie,"I turned it off after about 15 minutes. The story is totally predictable since it's been told many times onscreen before. That could be forgiven if the screenwriting and acting was any good, but it's atrocious! Don't waste your time and money!"
3,Fair,"Oversexed college kids. Reused story line. Not very imaginative. Not a great picture. Run of the mill. Would not recommend,"
2,predictable cabin in the woods,"concept for this movie is interesting and new. however, the scenes and characters in the flick were way too predictable and cliche'. could have been truly awesome, but turned out just ok."
3,CGI roller coaster ride,"Far from the worst and far from the best. It's a lot better than most teens in a forest cabin, haunted house etc movies. It's a CGI roller coaster ride, and like any other roller coaster ride, buckle up, put your brain in neutral, and enjoy the spectacle. Subtleties of plot and character development are irrelevant for this genre. The special effects were enjoyable, and I'm not a fan of zombie flicks - I just cannot suspend my disbelief sufficiently. The actors performed well, unlike some low-budget movies I've seen recently. My only dissatisfaction with this movie comes from a issue of taste: I generally prefer definitive happy endings. To each his own."
1,Worst movie ever,"This movie was horrendous. It started out okay but once the scary stuff started happening, it went downhill. The ending was abysmal. I gave it one star because the acting was better than the script."
1,"Terrible Film, stay away from!!","I rented this film because so much fuss was made, and I will watch almost anything horror. Not much to say but here is the break down.Pros+good idea for a film+My Favorite alien killer is in it.Cons-Bad acting-Tries to be a comedy (not funny)-Tries to be many different type films at once but fails at each-Boring kills-Bad writtingIn a nutshell, this film tries so hard to be evil dead-ish that its really sad because it was so bad. There are films out there that do good ""homeage"" and then there are bad ones that shame the film which is cabin in the woods. Save your money on this one, wasnt worth the dollar I spent at the red box."
1,This movie sucks,Save yourself the bother of watching this movie. This movie sucks. I kept waiting for it to not be comical. It's more horror-skit-comedy than pure horror. I laughed and was never scared. Booo.
1,all i can say is wow...,"This has got to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. I cant believe I even finished it... not to mention I hate when every other word is a curse word, seriously, what's the point?"
2,A BIG disappointment!,"-NO SPOILERS-Take a group of college students, place them at a secluded cabin in the woods and throw in some zombies to terrorize them (as well as many other creatures, fears and anything that nightmares are made of)...sounds like the makings of a classic horror film. Well, I would agree, but instead of leaving the plot there, the film makers decided to be creative and throw in a twist that ruins the entire film. ""The Cabin In The Woods"" suffers from the plot twists and the end result is a mess of a movie that doesn't make much sense. As if the alternating shifts in plot were not bad enough so much of the film is shot so dark some scenes are barely visible. As a huge fan of horror films I can't recommend ""The Cabin In The Woods."""
1,Waste of money and time!,I wish I could give this no stars! This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't believe they got these actors to play the roles in this movie. There isn't enough of a story line to keep you guessing and entertained. You are trying to figure out what is going on and this is confusing. We watched this as a group and even the people who never talk through movies couldn't stop questioning this movie. I understand fictional movies but this is just stupid. I wish I could get back the 2 hours I spend watching and debating this movie....what a waste.
1,Possibly the worst horror movie ever made,"The Cabin in the Woods was absolutely horrible, possibly the worst horror movie ever made, especially the last 30 minutes were ridiculous. Absolute waste of money!"
1,Sucks!!!!!!!!!,"Bad story line, bad concept. It is a complete failure. People going out into the woods ......and what is waiting for them? How about nonsense."
3,meh,"The movie has a great story line, a little confusing in delivery though. Also I watched the entire movie and I still do not know what actually happened."
2,Great movie until the end,"Before I saw this film, I was excited to get this movie from the library. After watching it, I was thankful that I didn't pay a dime to see this movie. The movie was awesome, until the ending, then the movie lost all credibility. What a freakin disappointment. Very clever premise but Joss just dropped the ball, couldn't bring it home, choked. Actually I think he said, ""screw it, I'm tired.""Let me help you, do not pay to see this movie. Wait for Netflix or get if from the library."
1,Sick torture porn,"I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon, I love Firefly. I just don't get why he had to go the torture porn route for this movie. The whole plot of the movie is great and it could have been a great movie. I guess if you like Saw and other torture porn stuff you will like this movie, but if you find those kind of movies disturbing then stay away from this. I just don't get it, I expected much better from Joss."
2,Didn't finish it,I'm not sure what this movie was supposed to be about. Maybe half way through we decided to watch something else. My brother loved it and told me I was nuts.
1,Conservatives and/or pro-lifers: keep walking,"I can't remember any more what put put me off, but I wasn't ten or fifteen minutes in before I had to stop watching. $3 I could have spent on something deserving."
1,sucked,"One of the worst movies ive ever seen, it wasnt scary or funny it was just plain stupid, they had monsters and all these creatures and the reason all the people die is because there supposed to be sacrificed to some god so it wont destroy the earth. and two people werent sacrificed so the last scene was a giant god hand crushing the cabin. so stupid."
3,Not a Directors Cut,This dvd is far too expensive to not be the director's cut. There were several scenes in the movie that could have been edited differently to create a greater impact. Guess I'm just gonna have to wait to buy this one
1,Cabin in the Wodds... stay away.,"Simply put, quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made.Not even eye candy (of which there was little) could make this worth seeing.Don't buy, rent or even waste time if it's free to watch.Wish I could have given 1/2 a star or a negative."
2,not worth it.,Not worth the hype and definitely not worth the money!! I would have been okay renting it not purchasing it.
2,Predictable,"I saw most of the reviews and thought I was going to see a film that had a unpredictable ending.... Pffff... It was completely predictable. someone was thinking outside of the traditional horror box. But it failed to entertain me. I was lead to believe there were ""twists"". But I felt there were too many clues on what the ending would bring."
1,not worth your time or money,"Like most of the one-star reviews- I found this movie to be a big let-down. The trailers and commercials made it look much better than it really was. If you're in the mood for a corny, funny, not scary, not suspensful movie with mediocre visual effects, then go ahead and watch this flick."
2,yuck dont bother,"this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Dont bother, dont waste your money and dont waste your time"
2,Horror?,"I cant believe they have the Gull to call this a Horror movie. The scenes in the underground were Hokey at best. It was like watching a 1942 remake of the monster from below.. hated it. Very disappointed. I was like so many,, So excited and couldnt wait to see it. But very disappointed."
4,Twisted fun!,This is not your typical cabin in the woods horror film. Takes the whole Been there done that and shakes it up with wonderfully bad dialogue and cliches.
3,Twisted,"It's a weekend movie, for sure not a full price ticket.It's somewhat original and it will keep you entertained but overall it fills like the old and predictable."
2,Interesting,The story caught my attention. Pulled me in only to lead me rather disapointed about the ending. I dont know. The end of the world with the only way to justify thing is to do more evil left me pretty much bored with the ending being less imaginative. Much of the movie had great imagination but the ending seem to drop from it and go to a spin that to me spun down the drain.
5,Even better than expected,"Thought this would be just another teen/college kids slasher movie, but the twists make it even better...a nice surprise. I'll probably watch it again."
5,Rocked My Socks!,"This movie is a horror movie fans wet dream but, over all just a fun movie with humor, horror, and twists."
5,"Come for the horror, stay for the Whedonisms","This is a great movie. If you're a fan of Joss Whedon's work, you'll really enjoy this movie. Definitely a whole new twist in on your typical ""pretty people get hunted down by crazed murderers"" story. The special features are great too!"
5,A smart and refreshing horror movie worth geeking out about.,"We saw this in the theatres, we went in not knowing anything about the movie, only hearing great reviews from our friends. If you are a lover of Evil Dead, Cthulu, Firefly, and Dungeons and Dragons this is the perfect movie for you. The writing is smart, and it takes all the elements you loved from horror movies when you were a kid and applies enough wit and snark for any adult to enjoy. It's gory and geeky and I can't wait to see it again."
4,cabin in the woods,"Pretty good. Was a little slow at first, give it a chance does get better. The ending was awesome. would recommended to horror fans"
4,Quirky fun,Just finished watching. Perfectly enjoyable. Might have been happier getting it from RedBox if it hadn't been out of stock... But I'm a cheap'o.
4,Great for a fun movie night with college friends,"This 'horror-comedy' that bends and breaks all the rules for the scary movie genre was a real treat for my friends to watch. We got scared, laughed at the top of our voices, and we were so enthused once we left. I recommend the movie for a college age audience and a fun-loving crowd. The shipping and packaging were perfect, and the versalitly of the Blu-ray/digital copy made this a steal for the price."
1,Not what I was expecting...,This movie had a terrible storyline. The actors had very poor acting skills and the movie looked liked it was produced in the 1950s. What happened to good horror movies? This one was very far from good.
1,what a bomb,Um wow....so stupid. I'm dumber for watching this truly tragic waste of pixels . OMG I wish I could get my money back
1,Cabin in the Woods,In my opinion this movie was a waste of money and time. That's 2 hours of time I will never get back!
1,Cheesy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Just preditiable just like the scary movies it is trying to copy! Worst movie i seen all year! I love scary movies & this is garbage! Crappy ending!!!
1,"SUCKS, SUCKS",The worst movie l have ever watched don't waste your money it sucks.I can't believe I wasted part of my life watching this movie. If youare a brainless moron you will love it
1,Terrible Movie,"This has got to be one of the worst ""horror"" films ever. I saw this in the theatre and couldn't find the exit door fast enough. Don't waste a dime on this."
3,You have to be kidding me,"What is it with the retro, ""let's exhume the Cretan tribute meme"" thing that's blowing through young adult creepy movies? Hunger Games. Cabin in the woods. The tribe must continue at the expense of the young. Are these people on drugs? I mean, really, are they getting stoned somewhere? Nah, I suppose, were I to ask, an answer would be, ""oh, you just don't UNDERSTAND..."" Oh yeah, sure. I'm sure there's a deep message in here somewhere- they probably just ripped it off from LOST and Damon LIndelof, or Abrams- ""the human condition is such that it must, at all times, be appeased in the vitiating fires of pure ritualistic sacrifice, for the tribe, for humanity, to continue. If we do not, then, humanity is lost... we will become a cannibalistic tribe of testosterone fueled behemoths, bent on the destruction of all but our own very selves... What a dismal and puerile outlook on humanity. What are these suckers smoking?"
1,I didn't like it,"I could only stand watching until the part when a girl is dared to make out with a wolf's head. It's just so....predictable. The jokes are ones we have heard before. The characters act self absorbed and mean. It's just over produced crap, really, showing the typical mind set of Hollywood today. Pushing glossed over crap."
1,Not for mature audiences,"Just another teen extermination film, though somewhat classier than others. Larger variety of monsters, better non-bloody effects, though there's no skimping on the blood."
1,CRAP,This movie has to be the biggest rubbish of all time. To think that Rolling Stone magazine thought it entertaining. Really? Don't waste your time with it.
1,Terrible movie,"We rented this movie for Halloween based on all of the great reviews and It will go down on one of the worst movies I've ever seen. We actually thought it was a spoof movie, which it kind of is, but still made no sense at all to us. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Horrorific!,This movie is like watching the horror version of the Truman Show or Hunger Games. There's nothing original with the plot. Turned out to be such a disappointment for me.
1,Waste,A complete waste of time! The previews make it seem like it's going to be a really good movie but then you find out it's a GAME; huh?? Very bad movie. Basically think of your worst nightmare and a company has stored all of these nightmares in a huge glass vault and then they play a game and bet on it as to who will choose which nightmare. Don't waste your time.
2,Too predictable,"This was just too much of the same old routine. If you are a fan of horror movies, this is not one you would ever remember."
2,One of the craziest movies I ever watched!!!,"I bought this movie and watched it and I was like ""WHAT??"" It was one of the craziest movies I have ever watched.Was not scary to me. Didn't make much sense. Just didn't like it."
2,Weird Movie with A Epic Ending. LOL!,"Why did Sigourney Weaver have to die????????????? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!, in all in all worst movie but entertaining I guess? long story short Beginging was good until the End of it that's when it went down hill from there., MY BRAIN LITERALLY ALMOST EXSPLODED!!"
1,Cute idea. Tedious,Interesting idea for a horror flick. Hit all the cliche's. See if you can recognize all the references to other horror characters. Glad I didn't pay $10 to see it in a theater.
2,LOST!!!,"It started out ok.I guess.On into the movie I couldnt figure out who all these people with cameras and more or less controling EVERYTHING that involved the people in the cabin.Then,at the last of the movie,the giant hand coming up outta the ground really throwed me for a loop.Hell,2 loops!!! I wouldnt watch it again."
1,Waste of time,"This movie was awful, not scary, waste of money and time. STUPID RIDICULOUS PHONY Would rather have a root canal than watch it again"
1,B-Movie,"Not sure if the movie was meant to be scary but this has to be one of the worst movies ever like watching an old D movie, think I was laughing more than anything."
1,Stupid movie,"Just like the title says, stupid movie. Not scary at all, seems like the people who made this movie might have been on LSD. A great way to waste $20 on a blu-ray that you probably won't even watch all the way through."
1,Too Dark,"This movie might have been scary, but it was filmed in almost total darkness- too dark to see any action. Three thumbs down!!"
3,Can someone please explain what happened?,"This movie started out as a pretty good zombie movie but then went somewhere else and then somewhere else again. Sigourney Weaver strolls in and then the movie ends. What happened exactly? The zombies were excellent and very scary. This movie seems to want to be more then it can be. I would of been OK with just the zombies and the control room drama. But no, we have to watch cheap digital monsters take away from the really good zombies. Not sure where all the 5 star reviews came from. I even dozed off for a few minutes."
2,Save your money.....and your time!,This movie sucked. What a waste of time. I knew just from previews I shouldn't have watched it but it got great reviews. So save your money and your time. You have been warned.
1,The Cabin in the woods...,This was the dumbest most stupid waste of my time. I was supposed to be one type of movie but never was.Save you money thank goodness I didn't see this at a theater!
2,"wicked, messed up movie","Not worth more than a buck to see! The trailer doesn't really match what you would in this movie, but watch it if you dare."
1,Waste of time,Had no interest.. didn't keep us entertained we didn't even finish the movie which rarely happens.. I don't like spending money to change the channel.
2,Meh.,"Let it be known that I am a devoted and loyal Joss fan. And I love Drew Goddard - his eps of Buffy, Angel and Lost are among my favorites, and Cloverfield was awesome. I missed this movie when it was in theaters, so I've been patiently waiting for the DVD release and didn't mind shucking out $15 to buy it.Um, can I have my money back now? This was like watching a ""very special episode"" of Buffy -- except with far less wit, charm and suspense. Something was just...off. It was a tremendous disappointment, but I did like the Heathers ending. I hold out hope for another collaboration b/t these two."
1,Worst movies ever,"Don't even bother wasting your time or money on this movie. Seriously, the whole story line is ridiculous and full of bad acting. I'm surprised I saw any recognizable actors in this movie to begin with."
2,Bad script,"Although I was nailed to my seat and surprised with the twists and turns in this movie, I was never really scared. The script is not great and the horror scenes not very convincing. Rather give me the old horror movies of the 20th century!"
4,Funnier than I expected.,"I love just about anything from Joss Whedon, but I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. It was far more entertaining and had better story than I thought it would."
3,Decent Horror Flick,"This is a pretty good horror flick with elements of black comedy. The premise is kind of weak, but the special effects were well done and it never got boring. I'd recommend it."
4,Scary Fun,"Was better than expected. Too scary for the wife to see, but still packed full of humor. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy a dark comedy."
4,A Smart Entertaining Horror Film,"Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon came up with this new youth horror film premise with the selection of 5 fine young actors and a couple of veteran actors as the ""villians"" and a ""lean"" budget. The end result is a satisfying ""cabin in the woods"" film with just right amount of gore and often inventive hilarious shocks. A smart entertaining horror film."
5,Amazingly Good,"At first I was skeptic but the film turned out to be quite good. One of the few horror movies of the last 3 years that I like, right now the Genre has been quite lousy and predictable in the past few years. The Cabin In The Woods offers a mix of everything but done right. It was a well scripted film from beginning to end. The acting was well done and the special effects were superb. Very good film all around."
1,what a terd,"cheezy bad acting the movie fails to keep suspence as you try to figure wtf? is going on in this flick ok so there traped in a cabin in the woods, how typical but soon takes off on a bazar ritual to save the world and sacrafice the inhabitants of the cabin , in my own words it was a terd a big pile of boston steameri mean it could have been written better lacking in true horror trust me this movie will leave you-- why the ""f"" did i bother with this movie -- but hey at leased you did not buy it destine for the .99 cent bin at your local storejason and freddie have nothing to worry about as cheezy horror flicks are not dead just ripping you off"
1,crappy,"pretty crappy movie. very predictable, boring, worn out, same ol same bad horror movie. the wiggles have better writing in their episodes than this piece of garbage."
1,Who's really loving this movie?,"I'm just not feeling it. Best horror film in years? A masterpiece? Excellent? Not even.i'm Having a hard time getting through it. I believe the studios are paying a staff to write positive reviews these days. there really are tons of people out there who just love crappy stuff,though but Either way,ignore the hype on this stinkfest."
2,you gotta be kidding me???,How does this movie get a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and the critics say it is so great? The reason is because this movie actually makes fun of horror movies. I have no problem with that even though I love horror movies but it just didn't turn out right. The movie was good until the last 25 min or so. Once you find out what's going on it gets really messy and just loses it for me. If you like maybe the Evil Dead movies than you will like this but if you are a die hard horror fan thinking this movie is a horror movie than you will be pissed especially at the end of this mess. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because the movie was interesting until the last part. I can't believe this was made by the same folks that made the avengers... that was an excellent movie!
1,Fails to live up to hype.,"I never, EVER write reviews, but this particular movie brutally shattered my expectations.I'll keep this short, and spoiler free.Everyone goes on and on about how great of a plot twist this film has. This simply is not the case. It is predictable and flimsy at best. Anyone who has seen a trailer knows most of it, and it doesn't take long to figure out the rest. The saddest thing is that it isn't even that clever. It feels as though the filmmakers didn't know how to end it and it was rushed.Bottom line, it would be a mercy to have this film spolied for you in advance."
3,Was ok,"Without trying to spoil the movie, I will say it was decent till the end! Then it got way out of hand! I wouldn't watch it again unless a friend wanted to see it, so then I could see there reaction lol. Wouldn't say it was a waste of time though"
2,Lots of Potential but.....,"Missed the mark, Well worth a $5 rental but i wont be adding it to my collection. Good casting but could have used a different director"
2,Disappointing,"I really looked forward to renting this, as I had missed it in theaters and the previews looked great. But ALL of the good scenes were IN the previews! They never really had it all together in the first place, but it REALLY fell apart at the last 30 minutes. It's almost like they forgot what they were making a movie about. There's holes in the story, and you at first ask yourself ""What's happening?"" Then you realize, you don't care because you're just disengaged at that point. I'm a huge horror fan, and this fell flat. ONE of the ""creatures"" was made up well and had the creepy factor, and that's the ONLY reason it gets 2 stars instead of one. If you're looking for a good, fun, scary horror movie, keep looking."
2,this movie is really a 'how to' video,This movie is all about how to ruin an absolutely fantastic movie concept in under 1 hour 36 minutes. Just how many sequels did the movie producers give up on? I guess the world may never know...+ Two stars for a great concept- three stars for a awful delivery
3,Hmmmmm,"There was total chaos and Anarchy reining towards the End of the movie, great horror flick, recommend itTwo thumbs up,"
3,Pretty good horror flick,"This is a pretty good horror pic, it is a little clever and different. In a way it is a serious parody of the horror films. It starts out like the typical genre pic with five young adults, that go to spend the weekend at a cabin in an isolated area in the woods. They start getting attacked by creatures, that are being controlled by some technicians in a control room, who's goal is to see that the creatures succeed, near the end of the movie you find out why, it has a surprise cameo by Sigoury Weaver. The movie is worth a look."
5,Hands Down One of the Best Scary Movies EVER,"The movie is awesome! It's tough to find a good scary movie that doesn't have a stupid plot, bad graphics and terrible acting.-It has some humor.-The characters aren't annoying.-It doesn't take long to get to the plot.-The typical characters are kind of made fun of.-The ending is a little surprising."
4,fear inducing,".... and that's what I didn't like. If you can stay out of the fear, there is a lot of valid information here. I really liked the part where the idiot minions get attacked by their own creations."
5,neat horror movie cabin in the woods is,just enjoy this flick as a horror fan it would be worth checking out...so check it out if you dare. cool twists
3,Chris Hemsworth is a god!,"Okay not in this movie at least, but he is pretty dreamy. Overall the spin on this one is different and has never been done to my horror knowledge. However, although I love Wedon's comic genious and timing in a world that has gone astray I am not sure if the ending if this one did it for me. Watch and weigh in yourself."
3,Really cool,A twist on your classic horror movie. I really enjoyed it and added it to my collection. Keeps you guessing to the end. Well done.
2,What A Joke of a Movie,This weekend I watched this movie no not a movie it was more like a want to be movie. I do not know what to make of it. It was not funny enough to be a comedy it did not scare me so no it was not a horror. It was not a T and A movie only got 1 topless shot. The action was dull so no not an action movie and believe me there was not drama.I can not believe the hype over this movie it was predictable and just boring and made no kind of sense at all. To me the acting was bad the lines were cheesy. I will not spoil the plot for any one but I will say it is not a horror movie at all or does it hold an suspense. And it produced zero laughs.
3,Good,A really good and unique plot. A lot of gore toward the end and one nudity scene. Not appropriate for the kids but adults should enjoy it
4,Lots of fun.,"This film was pretty darn close to perfection. I thought it got a bit goofy toward the end, but it was lots of fun with great writing. For an atheist, Joss Whedon is pretty talented."
5,hesitant viewer,"after first viewing the trailers for this movie i had the preconception that it would be just another campy horror movie, and put it in the same category as films like cabin fever, which i did not particularly care for but still watched all the way through. also seemed to be along the lines of the more recent rehash or remakes of older horror films (hills have eyes, TX chainsaw, etc.) which i really did not care for. this moviedid not change my perception of it until about twenty minutes in, the best advice for this movie is to rehash what others have written, leave your preconceptions at the door sit back and enjoy the ride. This movie turned out to be quite original, had great balance of humor, gore, plot turns, sci-fi, and was in my opinion a great movie. if you are a horror film fan, and are a fan of movies that dont take themselves to seriously, see this film."
4,Fun horror comedy.,"As a caveat, I am a Buffy and Angel fan as well as a horror fan, so of course I am going to like this movie. The movie is a neatly plotted horror comedy that exploits every horror trope whilst retaining a Wheedonesque flavor - more storytelling and character development than one might expect, and some dry dry funny moments. If you have seen the trailer, you know it is a little more that a straight up cabin-in-the-woods feature, so I will be giving little away if I say in some parts of the movie I thought I was in Wolfram and Hart Angel episode. Nicely gory finale, but with the humor you'll be able to sleep afterward (whilst saying: ""That movie was so clever and quietly funny"" to yourself). I thought the male lead (who was also in Dollhouse), was awesome. Only four stars as I felt the ending lacking, it's hard to end movies well."
4,Soild movie with great twists!,Not a huge horror man but this movie I was very happy with. NOt only does it give ample amounts of gore and death but it also has us guessing who is pulling the strings of the operation. Highly recommended.
5,Big fun!,We weren't quite sure what to expect with this one but once we got on the ride we didn't want to get off! Not at all predictable with a great cast.
5,Good movie,Not what u think it will be it is a surprise movie I was really impressed when it turned out like it did
4,Different!,"This is certainly not your typical horror movie. A very different, and somewhat interesting, twist on the ususal slasher thriller. Enjoyable none the less."
4,Must see!,Awesome movie! I was not expecting it to be what it was. Great action and great acting. A must buy!
3,Fun Movie,Not really a movie that will scare you - more taking a unique look at the horror genre through comedy and suspense. I liked the story line but I wasn't really blown away by it. I thought the acting was much better than most in this genre but the scenes that were really captivating were too far and few between for me to get on board. I loved the idea I just thought the execution was a little sloppy.
3,Watchable...,"Not as amazing as the reviews say. It does pull off the concept about as well as can be without actually crafting a story - so as a gimmick, it works - as a movie: fail."
2,Corn Ball Movie,"Thumbs down. Such a corn ball movie. Without spoiling themovie, I was disinterested in the entire movie but ploddedthrough it just to watch it. UUUgh."
2,Overrated,This movie was no where near scary. It was more like an action/comedy with a splash of horror. The special effects were awesome but I guess I was expecting something totally different because of the previews and crittic reviews.
3,Screwy,"This movie had me guessing at every step. I never knew what was coming. It was ok, but definitely not my most favorite movie."
2,Off To A Good Start But Soon Takes A Turn To Forgetable Nonesense,"We streamed this a few nights ago. The movie starts out with a premise that's hard to buy into but the occassional good scare and production values keep your attention. However what seemed plausible and enjoyable to watch soon turns predictable - and it get worse. By the end of the film they're throwing anything and everything we've seen doxens of times before at the screen it's tiersome, repetative and nothing new nor fresh.Perfomances are forgettable at best. As I watched the film derail I spent more time looking at the clock than the screen."
3,hmm,"This movie was really not that scary. How would I put this, was more messed up in sort of a way. And few funny parts, esp. with the clown, haha."
3,Surprising movie,Movie definitely had a different storyline than I thought when purchased. Not bad for the scare/blood bath movie genre. Definitely makes you think more than most.
1,"""B Rate Typical""","Although it's under a horror movie& category, this ends up being pretty typical....and the ending leaves you saying, seriously??I rented this online, I don't recommend buying it.FOOTNOTE: Do not be discouraged as I HIGHLY recommend Amazon instant movies [I've been renting and/or buying for some time]. Think about it, instead of going to Walmart or Best Buy, spending the time, gas and patience, why not rent or buy here? IF you Don't like the movie the Most you will have spent in rental is $3.99 [.99 - $3.99) OR you can buy for less than you would spend at the store....and still have money for snacks!"
1,So So stupid,Don't waste your money. Beyond stupid and not scary at all. Worst ending of any horror film I have ever seen.
1,Worst,"I think this is the worst movie I have seen in quite some time! I was sort of excited about the reviews here on Amazon. The only redeeming qualities of this movie were: The sort of Truman Show feel of the movie, and NIN's ""Last"" during the ending credits. This movie was more a comedy or a ""spoof"" of horror movies to me. Pretty cheesy and not very entertaining at all. I could not tell if it was trying to ""mock"" horror movies, but it seemed like it sort of was, but not doing a very good job at it."
1,Terrible,"Honestly the worst movie I have ever watched. Terrible storyline, terrible graphics, and makeup. Thanks for a waste of an hr and 36 minutes."
1,Weird,Weird movie. Not what I expected. And not in a good way. Never got scared. More confused than anything. Don't recommend you spending your time watching this.
1,Commercials/Trailers made it look great...,But...that was as good as it gets...total waste of a few dollars but total wastebofa Friday night!! Thevgebetal idea in beginning seemed good for the movie..but then just got stupid really fast & seemed NEVER ENDING!!! When it finally was over we(me & hubby watched it) just looked at each other & both said..Well that sucked!!! Was disappointed because trailer for movie made it look really good & turned out at the end besides feeling like you just wasted a night..felt like had a HORRIBLE ending. Please don't bother watching this..not worth it even a tiny bit..one of worst movies ever seen.
1,This sucked sooooo bad.,This movie made no sense whatsoever. Just a gorefest for kids. But then I only watched half of it. That was plenty for me. Don't bother!
1,Vile,"Just an opinion, I didn't like it at all and wish I hadn't wasted my money or time watching it. Very overly gross and sexual not at all scary"
1,Boooooring,I admit. Horror movies just aren't my thing. But with you know who at the helm I gave this a chance. Booooooooring!
1,Horrible Horror Story,This is a blood and guts video. Don't waste your time or money. Obviously a low budget production. Was hoping for some thrills from this movie preceeding Halloween night. More gore than plot. Very difficult to follow.
1,awful,"This movie had some good plot potential. It started out well, had some good moments in the start. Once the supposed horror started, it was just ruined. It was so dark I could barely see the hillbilly zombies. The kill scenes were done in the dark no shock value. The concept about the secret cabals running these places of sacrifice was barely brought to light. Once the team went into the inner workings of the cabin they had the most potential to make this great and they failed utterly. Disappointing movie!"
1,"complete waste of time, brain cells, energy, and everything else you could possibly give","This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Everyone whose name is attached to this movie should be horrified and completely embarassed. I can't believe Sigourney Weaver somehow got sucked into this but I still love her anyway. Horrible, horrible, horrible movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't think K. Harris and I were watching the same movie because Cabin in the Woods was not the least bit enjoyable or entertaining. It was a train wreck that you just can't take your eyes off of and at the end you actually feel like a complete moron because you will never get that 1-2 hours of your life back. Never!!!!"
1,Horrible. Quality and the movie itself.,I'm not one to complain... But the quality of this movie was really bad. A lot of it was in the dark and we literally couldn't see a thing. Also a couple times it went blurry and we fast forwarded through it. Very disappointed for the first time with amazon!
1,"Cabin in the ""Weeds...""","This movie was horrible. It reminded me of a cheesy 70s B-movie. I would rather watch ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" again than sit through another zombie movie like this one."
1,Waste of Time,"What a waste of time this film was, it was everything I thought it was going to be and what a stupid ending. This is one movie you wish you could get your money back from."
1,The Cabin in the Woods,"The Cabin in the Woods started out with great promise, but turned into a nightmare and not meaning the theme of the movie. The ending was ridiculous and I will never get back the time I spent watching it...what a waste!"
1,Terribly disappointing,"Was very excited about watching this movie. I was completely disappointed. As the movie started, I was excited thinking we may actually have a modern horror movie worth watching. I was sorely disappointed. This is two hours of my life I will never get back."
1,a letdown,"i love horror movies. this was a waste of money. to think that anyone can control what happens in an isolated cabin!! come on, silent house was way better than this one. i dont recommend this to anyone, do not waste your time."
1,terrible,A terrible movie don't waste your money.It dosen't deserve any stars. Would have gave it no stars but wouldn't let me
1,Makes no sense,I wasted 2 hours of my life with this trash. I like a good horror movie and this is not one. I bought this on reviews and I am wondering what type of people would like this. Don't waste your time and let this one go.
1,Awful,This movie was reviewed well by rotten tomatoes so I checked it out but was gravely disappointed. It starts out with an unsuprising plot and then just simply turns into gore. I was able to predict everything that was going to happen and did out loud. I hung in there hoping that there was some underlining point to the movie that would make it better but was disappointed with a pointless ending. I was an awful waste of time.
2,Hunger Games meets Scream,This movie is not at all what I expected. I made myself sit thru it all because I paid $3.99 to rent it. It is one of the strangest movies I have seen in quite some time....possibly ever. Do not waste your time unless you have no other options and it is free.
2,....What the heck? ? ? ?,"Why in the world is this movie getting so much positive reviews! What has this world come to!? Okay- The Cabin in the Woods. My son went to the theater and saw this movie because his girlfriend thought it'd be a good scary flick. He came home laughing, stating how terrible this film was. Me, on the other hand thought that it probably was stupid and figured that most scary movies are any way! So I decided to watch this movie. Biggest mistake I ever made. What I'm surprised to say is why in the world did I continue to watch it!?? Was it going to get better? NO! Was it going to have some amazing surprise at the end? NO! Am I missing something? I was very surprised to see that the great 2012 Marvel flick the ""Avengers"" director, also directed this stupid movie. So once again, am I missing something? I sure hope Chris Hemsworth and Sigourney Weaver got a big paycheck for this movie! Bottom line....Don't waste your time & money. Worst movie I've ever watched in my life!!"
1,Disappointed,I suppose I didn't understan what the movie was aboout because I was totally disappointed in the movie. I didn't like it at all.I would not recommend it to anyone!!
5,it's Joss,"The trailer for this movie was to cookie cutter, 5 young adults go to a house in the woods horror, but then I saw Joss was behind it and I got suspicious. With Joss nothing is what it seems; this movie is more an intelligent adaptation and parody of horror movies. It parodies classic horror movies like Evil Dead and Hellraiser, and gives a new take on why horror movies are the way they are. Don't watch this expecting to be a cheesy horror flick or you will be dissatisfied; remember its Joss, keep your mind open and in full working order. Don't be another doll."
4,People Just Don't Get It,"The people who gave this movie one star just don't get what this movie was about and what it was trying to do. Watch it for yourself and then judge. Don't take the haters word for it, this movie was well done."
2,Stupidly derivative,okay but not good. convoluted attempt to be clever. but it is merely annoying. Not recommended wait till it is free.
1,seen one? you've seen them all,"This was painfully cliche and horribly predictable. If you've seen one of these films about friends going out into the woods to 'get off the grid' then you've seen them all. Nothing to see here folks, move along.Disgusted and disappoined. Wish I could rate it 0 and have 2 hours of my life back."
2,not a show stopper,"I personally didn't liek this movie, not what I thought it was about. Don't waste your time or money ."
3,cabin in the woods,was not what i expected definetly would not buy it was a really weird movie but thats just my opinion.
3,Entertaining,"As much as it left me saying ""Really?"" and ""WTF"", I definitely found it entertaining. Now is it worth $4? No. Should this ever go on sale or on Prime, then it would be worth it. It's not really scary, as it is goofy and cheesy. Nonetheless entertaining to some extent."
2,THE CABIN IN THE WOODS,"very violent and scary. Thought it was going to be more of a semi romantic camping trip .Not recommended for young children, spooky enough to give you nightmares."
2,Over hyped,I didn't find this to be nearly as clever or entertaining as the buzz would have one believe. One sort-of-clever idea doesn't make a whole movie.
5,GREAT MOVIE,This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. It does an excellent job being both tongue-in-cheek and completely serious. While starting out as the horror movie that pokes fun at all horror movies...it makes an excellent horror movie. Hemsworth does a great job and the traditional jock and the lab geeks are really funny too.
5,very good,was bought for a christmas present he was very pleased with the dvd he watches it all the time.thank you
5,"Awesome, amazing! Loved it!",Confused at first but everything comes clear in an amazing and edge of your seat finale. Overall a terrific movie!
5,Amazing if you are a Joss Whedon fan and love the horror genre.,I really enjoyed this movie. Your enjoyment will grow exponentially if you agree with the following statements.1) You love the Whedonverse2) You enjoy the horror genre3) You enjoy movies about zombies4) You enjoyed (and watched recently) Evil Dead or Evil Dead 25) You like your scares to come from more than just loud music and gross out mutilationThis movie met all these criteria for me and then some. I also enjoyed the visual companion for this movie.Highly recommend.
4,Super Gory,"Cabin in the Woods wasn't for me. Even though a satire, the back story of whose behind it all and why is a bit too contrived and underdeveloped. Could see it having its fans among lovers of gory, sci-fi, B movies who have a twisted sense of humor. Funniest scene was when heroine is battling the bad guy on screen in the background while the crew, completely desensitized & oblivious, is partying. 3 1/2 stars."
4,That was fun,"In the beginning you could almost see what was going to happen next, but the other three quarters of the movie had me guessing. Loved that, love the uniqueness. Don't take the movie too seriously and just see where it takes you. It was disturbing and fun."
5,Scary,"Boy, what a movie, why did I get this one, I forgot!I will say this is a scary movie, I'm glad I had someone to hide behind!"
5,love,It started out kinda slow for my liking but by the end i was pumped up. Joss Whedon doesn't disappoint.
4,Not your typical High School massacre,"Joss Weedon has put his talents to good use in this DVD. Without them I don't think it would be even OK. The old premise of the High School kids going away for the weekend and getting murdered one by one, but with a twist. Especially at the end. If you are a Joss Weedon fan, you will notice a character from ""Dollhouse"" who plays an excellent part totally different to his other role. Worth watching, don't expect any major scares but very entertaining."
4,Weir,The movie is not scary but weir. Story line is hard to understand and doesn't make any sence until the end.
2,The Cabin in the Woods,"It was like an insane type of ""Hunger Games"". You killed off interesting characters too soon. Would not watch again."
4,fresh and funny,"fans of the genre will love it...others, meh. All's well that ends well, haha. Fresh and inventive. Rent it, dude."
5,Amazing movie,Completely surprised me when I first sat down in the theatre. This movie throws you for a fun loop as to what it may seem. Watch it you will like it.
2,... I don't know what just happened.,"My friend loved this movie and I have no idea why. This movie will leave you scratching your head asking, ""WTF?"" There are some funny scenes, but overall it is a weird movie."
4,cabin in the woods,"this movie was good, I wouldnt call it great. Of course I like these kinds of mmovies, and if they can not scare me or at least make me jump now and then, I dont find them good lol"
2,Didn't like it....,It was too weird for us! We watched it all the way through but it was a disappointment. The movie did have a good picture.
5,Avengers was the second best Joss Whedon film this year.,"If you were ever a fan of 'splatter' horror movies, you NEED to see this one. This is the film that Scream wished that it could have been. The most amazing meta-horror film of all time.Stands up to multiple viewings, and production detail is absolutely amazing."
2,Overrated,Truth be told it's Truman Show meets Evil Dead. It tries to be funny scary and clever all at once and succeeds at none of them. Tucker and Dale vs Evil or Cabin Fever are both more successful spoofs of the genre.
3,Disappointing!!!!,"New take on old horror genre. Bad acting & ridiculous plot twists make this an entertaining at times, but overall disappointing film."
1,Don't buy it if you haven't seen it,"I'm going to keep this short. I guess there is an audience for this movie but I guess I'm not part of it. I generally like movies that don't take themselves completely serious like Machete or Rubber, but this movie was just plain old not good. I went to this movie with 5 other people and not a single one of us had anything good to say about it. I guess the bottom line is some people like this movie but others hate it so don't buy it unless you've already seen it!!!"
1,Worst movie.,This movie was not good at all. The whole plot was given away in the first scene. It wasnt even a scary movie
1,the worst movie of all time,this movie is a waste of film. the plot was clear in the first reel. there where nothing to build up to u knew what was going on from the jump. i don`t know about u but i felt like i had wasted two hours of my life
2,Mixed emotions and mixed directions,"The acting was sub-par from decent actors. The script was ridiculous, but well conceived, and then poorly executed. This movie had lots of potential, but just fizzled out. It may be worth seeing if you like the lighter side of Joss Whedon, but it is so over the top in some points it comes off as trying too hard, and then lacking so much at other points that it doesn't seem it's trying hard enough,"
3,it was weird,I was expecting these 5 college student to be killed of 1 by 1 them trying to get away from supernatural spirit work but took a twist with the other it was really weird have not decided if I like it or hate it.
4,A fun diversion,"This is just a fun little horror film. It has some genuine scares, humor, and solid performances. It is not the groundbreaking genre-changer that it was hyped to be & it's ending is a little weak, but it is a blast to watch. I'd put it in the same league as Trick-R-Treat- spooky, escapist fun."
5,"Original, funny, and twisted","I haven't had so much fun seeing a horror movie in years. If you are a horror fan, this movie is definitely made for you, given all the references to other horror flicks in it. Honestly, it is really hard to write any sort of review here without spoiling a lot of the movie, given it's many twists and turns... so I'll just say this. The movie is hysterical, well-acted, and a completely mind@#*!. The Blu-ray is great quality, the commentary track funny and highly entertaining, and the special features are pretty darn interesting as well. Also, if you are a fan of Whedon's other works, you'll find a lot of your favorite actors from his other projects are here too. Obviously Chris Hemsworth (Avengers) and Fran Kranz (Dollhouse) are here as main characters, but you'll also get some Amy Acker (Angel) and Tom Lenk (Buffy). That guy knows how to put a cast together."
5,Joss Whedon does it again,"Okay, this is admittedly a little out of the norm for Joss, at least if you look at it from the slasher movie view point. But then this is so much more than a slasher movie. There is a twist to all the killings and really there aren't that many of them at least not until the last 30 minutes of the movie and that is when it gets interesting. This Evil Dead meets Saw meets the mad scientist. To explain it more will give too much away and this is one movie you should see simply because it is directed by Joss Whedon and no one does campy horror better than him. Get your popcorn, turn out the lights and sit down for a wild ride, Joss Whedon style"
5,Fun to watch,First horror movie in a long time to not be blood soaked. Very interesting to watch in order to figure out what is happening. Highly recommended.
4,A fun romp for horror movie fans,"If you like horror movies, and you like things that are a little 'spoofy' on horror movies you will probably enjoy this. It isn't quite going for the laughs like Scary Movie but it is in some ways similar. Perhaps a little more like Scream in its commentary."
5,Awesome. Not what you expect. Really.,"yes, it's a horror movie, and yes, there's a cabin in the woods. There's even a band of young, attractive 20-somethings involved. But still... this is not the trope you expect."
3,cabin in the woods...weird,"Movie gives a new twist to old slasher movies. Not what I expected, kind of a reality TV review of a friday the 13th or Halloween type movie...not scary...somewhat funny...very different...kinda weird....worth watching...once."
2,thought scary,"movie I thought would be scary but turned out to be predictable. Just another show that the commercial is better than the movie, would not recommend this movie... Michael"
4,So flippan weird.,"Not like any horror movie I have ever seen, so kudos to the production/director. Definitely weird. Definitely worth watching. Only issue I had was trying not to sing 'Boats n' Hoes' in my head everytime the dad from Step Brothers was on stage. Also seems a little low budget for Thor, but hey, everyone's gotta eat sometime, right?"
5,Great fun...BUT...,This is a great movie. I will buy it and recommend that everyone see it. However (semi-spoiler alert) IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TENTACLE!
5,Most fun movie I've seen in a long time!,"Even if you know the twist generally, it's still a must-see!I'm not a horror movie buff, but this one was fantastic. Without giving too much away it's almost a thought-provoking parody with a lot of symbolism, that delves into the psychology of why we watch horror films and derive entertainment from them, and what it does to society. The stereotypes are meant to be overplayed, but the acting is done just right.One of the top 20 movies I've seen! Give it a chance and you won't regret it!"
4,Original & Suspenseful..Loved It,"It's about time that a horror movie ended differently than all the others before it. I am extremely critical of movies, so this is one in a long line of so-so movies that I really loved. It's fast-paced, has an original concept, and a great, not typical ending. Take chance on this movie, it's worth the money"
4,twist,"This movie was a great creepy story, with a weird ending. It wasn't what we were expecting. Liked it more than we thought we would."
2,"Eh, it was okay.","I expected more of a reveal-type thing at the end. Hohum. The characters and script were solid, but like Whedon's ""Angel"", the story lacked me giving a great big care about anything at the end. I love the idea of the movie; very interesting.Characters and script-5Plot-4Overall enjoyment-2.5"
3,Thank more HP Lovecraft than slasher porn,Interesting premise. I can't really write a review without giving too much away but if you like HP Lovecraft you'll like this movie. Definitely different take on the slasher porn movies.
3,A bit far fetched,This was too far fetched for us. It just got weirder and weirder as the movie went on. Not the best.
3,Starts off promising but...,"It being a Joss Whedon flick, I thought it would be good. It started off pretty promising, but about halfway through it took a turn for the worse. If you like cheesy horror flicks, you will probably like it."
3,mehhhh...,"Good movie. Although, not quite worth all the hype preceding it. Interesting story concept.better than most young adult hack and slash films. That being said, I still love me some Whedon."
3,Scary Horror,"I thought it was going to be really scary, but it wasn't. It was kind of funny in the end. I'm just not scared by zombies. I'm scared about 30 Days of Night. I wish I had thought about the darkness that falls in Alaska, and eww those teeth! Werewolves scare me too, like in the movie, Silver Bullet. Cabin in the Woods is okay, but it really didn't scare me all that much."
2,Silly movie,"I thought this was one of the dumbest movies I had ever seen. OK, maybe I should just roll with the silly fun, but I probably would have enjoyed it more had I known how preposterous it was going in"
1,Low Resolution,"It was extremely difficult to watch because of the low resolution. I don't understand how the movie could be rated any better since it seemed to have been filmed with an iphone,"
2,lame,Very disappointing. The only thing that held my interest was wanting to know who the people in the room were. The monsters were cheesy. The gore was just as cheesy and the ending was the cheesiest. I would have been happier with a cartoon.
3,It Had Its Moments,"I had somehow missed all the advertisements on this one so I had no clue what the movie was going to be about. So as to not give anything away, I will only say that the movie consisted of an interesting concept (twist) and was ultimately enjoyable to watch as you were guided through simple yet intriguing dialogue and modern horror action that eventually revealed a rather grand plot that could affect the entire world.To me this movie wasn't really worth owning, but is worthy of at least a one-time rental just to say you've seen it. Of course everyone's tastes are varied, so your mileage may vary."
1,A total disaster of a film...,"They should have offered refunds to those that got scammed by this film. It was a total mess with one hot star, Chris Hemsworth, and even his character was short lived and idiotic.This is a film that should have been given the trashcan award, because that's exactly where it belongs... in the garbage."
1,Not so good,"This movie was one of the most bizzare and unsettling movies I have seen recently expected. I was looking for a traditional scare and chop them up thang, and instead I got a more than unbelieveable story line mixed in with a paranormal ghost like unbelievable experience."
1,Hunger Games meets Scary Movie,"Super Corny...Hunger Games meets Scary Movie...and the ending was just...there was no ending...they tried to be scary, but were being way too corny."
2,seriously???!!!,"I had been looking forward to renting this movie. Ok, it has it's moments, but SERIOUSLY!!! It was fun trying to place the ""movie monsters "" when you got to see them all at the last chapter of the movie. But, the ending sucked!"
1,One of the worst movies EVER!,"This movie was so stupid, it actually made me angry! I should've contacted Amazon for a refund PLUS wrote the studio that made this ""movie"" and told them to pay me for watching it! And then Sigourney Weaver shows up at the end, she must've owed someone a favor to appear in this piece of crap! Not at all what I expected!"
1,Worse movie ever!,"Really couldn't wait to see this movie because of all the great reviews. What a total disappointment - horrible, horrible movie! Don't waste your money."
1,Disappointed,"I had decent hopes, but this movie was possibly the worst I've seen in the last 10 years. The plot seemed like they had 2 people writing 2 different stories and were forced to make them merge.It's a review, therefore opinion, but I would avoid this film at all costs (even free)."
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!,This is the worst movie ever let alone the fact that its not scary at all. I honestly don't know why they such stupid movies. I wish I could give negative ratings...
1,el stinko,"A total waste of digital space.A perfect movie to fall asleep to, immediately. Do not bother to spend your money on this looser."
1,Worst movie ever...,I can honestly say that this was the worst movie I have ever seen. Writing this review was scarier than The Cabin In The Woods.
1,cabin in the woods,"bad! bad! bad! sick makes no senese want my money back ! too evil didnt no how to stop or complain sorry i even look at it i thought it was about something total diffferent dont no why,amazon doesnt have a direct number to call to say i cant watch this!i want my money back i think they should let u know how to call and turn the movie off so u dont have to pay for somthing u do want to see because it to horrible to watch. give u something funny to watch would be nice something we dont have to pay for and then be disapointed why cant u give us something for free funny and light hearted"
1,Dumb!!!!,Dumbest movie in the world. I fell asleep at the drive-in last year and was really disappointed because I love horror movies and was hoping for a scary evil dead like show instead it was not scary and like the Truman/Hunger games instead!!!
2,Cheesy,This movie was not at all what I expected. Thought it would be scarier. It turned out to be cheesy and too unbelievable.
2,Lame-o in the Woods,So predicitable! The only good point was when the aquaman ate that jerk professor....... was the only redeeming social value of this turkey.
2,Good try on the storyline,"I give credit for a pretty decent twist in the storyline. It was definitely different from anything I've seen before. However, it was not enough to save the film from falling prey to bad acting and generic ""horror film"" characters that we've seen 100 times."
2,Piffle....,"A reviewer on these pages asks if those who gave this filmone star actually watched the same film as him/her. Such washis/her incredulity, one supposes, that others may not have thesame sort of feelings toward this piece of dross as he/shedoes.So, in the spirit of mutual recognition - I promise, Cabin inthe Woods was definitely one and the same as per all the reviewshere - I give this effort from the Whedon stable two stars.One star for Anna Hutchison's bum and one star for somethingelse."
2,Shaun of the Dead Hunger games,"This movie was all over the place. It was like watching four different movies in one. I only gave it two stars for the good graphics towards the end, but during the whole movie It was like ???? for me. Also, it seemed so rushed. The name of the movie does not fit in my opinion. Not worth the money."
2,I expected more from even an un`authorized biography,"I agree with Juan. It is not worth your $20. Disasterpieces was amazing, but even for an un`authorized biography, I expected more. First off, they spelled Jim Root`s name wrong. Secondly, the quiz section asks who is in the Murderdolls. It kept telling me the answer was Sid Wilson. Save up for an authorized DVD; that`s my suggestion."
1,Not Another One,"Jesus, I once got sucked into the garbage as well. These unauthorized videos are by far the worst things I've ever seen. Since they're unauthorized they won't show the band or any music or videos or anything that you'd expect from a band DVD. I've yet to find a good one. And trust me i've seen a few. $18 for something like this is not worth it. Wait for your friend to buy it, and borrow it from them. Unless you're a real hardcore fan of Slipknot then you don't want this. Just get they're DVD Disasterpieces instead. That was pretty damn good."
4,Good book,Really helped dealing with the issues I have from being raped. Would recommend this to others dealing with the same thing.
1,Faith Based Assumptions Galore,"Loads of faith based assumptions. The writer also expects you to have that same blind faith in her, and loads of others she is always quoting (But from where? Her friends?). Do you know basic science? Do you know how experiments are conducted? Well, if you remotely do this book is not for you because the ""scientists"" in this book do not seem to. If you are an Atheist I wouldn't bother with this one either, actually run. The other negative reviews got it right on the money, it is hard to read, quotes from all over and your guess will be as good as mine to where they came from. Except her friends... She tells us those are her friends so she is clear there. And last but not least her friend of a friend story about the colon cancer was especially ignorant. I tried to do it. I tried to get to the good part of the book. There isn't one. I hope I save someone 20 bucks and when I come across a good one I will be sure to edit this to share."
5,I am in awe of this book!,"I found this book by accident at a Unity Church bookstore. I was drawn to it because of an aura I saw around it. The book blew me away. It contains a simple script anyone can use to help find and release the core reason for any issue. The message of the book is that healing can be easy, safe, and painless. This is a work from the heart, that touches your spirit. I met the author recently and found her to be as loving as her book. I real find. I urge everyone considering it, to just get the book. You'll love it."
5,Great...but I NEED some help!,"I loved this book very much, but can someone help me? Throughout the book, Karol refers to ""the script"" in passing. In several places, she provides a sentence or two. Nowhere is there a page that has ""The Script"" and it's laid out for you. Did I miss it? Please let me know. I'd love to use this valuable tool properly. My book does not appear to be missing any pages.Thanks!Lukeluke91205@hotmail.com"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting it to help me identify and process feelings, and it seemed like it just kept blaming all my feelings on in-utero and birth experiences. While I believe there is some truth to that, the book spent way too much time going over problems in-utero and during delivery. It took way to long to get to any pertinent information to help healing. I do not recomend this book."
2,Put me to sleep,"It's all one chapter, as far as I can tell. I didn't finish it. The Lord God is my fix - thank goodness."
4,Excellent,"I am not done with this book yet, however, it is just what I have needed. She is amamzing. It is everything I am going through at this time. It is bringing up feelings I had buried. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is lost confused etc..."
5,Exellent Book,I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a great way to clear unwanted baggage out of you life and it teaches the importance of our words and thoughts.
5,Great Book,This is a great book. You will learn so much about where your anger and resentment comes from. I would highly recommend this book.
5,This tells where feelings first begin. how the feelings are often buried and how to obtain peace in all areas of our life.,"While this book tells the forming of feelings in utro and soon after birth, I wished it had gone more into other areas experienced as young children and teen agers. It was very interesting and I found the part of feelings affecting the physical was especially fascinating."
5,This book helps you get over your past and present!,"I choose this book, because my friend recommended it to me. I love it! It has helped me get through a lot of issues from my past and even a few I just started. I would recommend this book to everyone! It is excellent!"
5,amazing empathy with this book,"Just what I was looking for to help lift my next 'layer' or that 'blocking' feeling. I highly recommend this book. Using the 'script' as instructed, really helped my spirit."
1,Pop psychology,"This book is just a pop psychology miss mass of the author (s) own ideas and personal experiences. The primary focus is to uncover ""Satanic Ritual Abuse"" or other abuse that a person is trying to ignore. My aunts swore by this book for all of a month in 1991 until the next big pop psychology book came out. The idea that your foot hurts as an adult because of some past childhood traumatic experience that you buried as a child is probably true if you actually did sprain, break a bone, or just had wrong fitting shoes. The author(s) do not consider this when they write the book. The bible is a better book to read to work through your feelings."
5,feelings buried alive never die,"this is a nice book, very appropriate for me since my husband of 35 years just passed away 4 mos ago, and i am still dealing with feelings that have been long buried, and those that i want to bury now. he also had issues from his early childhood that affected his life, which i can better understand now."
5,The Biomed Bible for Autism,"Great work, very helpful. Highly technical in parts, but the explanations are understandable. Many diagrams, charts, lists. Comprehensive index & reference list.The book begins with an explanation of the multitude of individual factors that can complicate health & developmental progress in individuals with autism. It gives details about skin & gut problems, special diets, yeast issues/antifungals, allergens, detoxification, metabolic disorders, and lab tests.The last 1/3 of the book discusses about 36 different supplements for autism: specific vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, probiotics, amino acids, and others.While this book is not inexpensive, it is worth its weight in gold. Pangborn & Baker helped me make dietary and supp changes that were very helpful to my child."
3,Not as helpful as author's previous book,"I would recommend _Starting Out_ (Davis's previous book) over this one. That book (Starting Out) is the best book on buying a house I've seen and I've looked at dozens. This book seems to contain some of the same information, but less of it. I think the take-along workbook idea, at least in this format, is a failure. The spiral binding is flimsy. All of the pages of my copy are falling out and it hasn't seen much use. The workbook idea is good, but not flexible enough. Sure you could make copies of a page if you needed another sheet for interviewing a real estate agent and you could write out some more of your house wish list items if you found there weren't enough lines, but it doesn't seem worth it. I think most people would be more comfortable with whatever organizational system they already use: a paper planner, a PDA, just typing things out on the computer, whatever. The content is great, but you can get that ( and more of it) in her other book."
3,PeggySchultz.biz - THE South Suburban Chicago Real Estate EXPERT,"My clients would absolutely love this book! In fact, it would be very helpful for Sellers too. Great insight as to what Buyer's are looking for. Of course, any Realtor worth their commission should be giving their clients all of this information from day one.I prepare an extensive spiral bound notebook customized for my client's needs and market place.[...]"
5,Great UV filter at a good price!,I was looking for a UV filter for my newTamron AF 17-50mm F/2.8 XR Di-II LD SP ZL Aspherical (IF) Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Camerasbut didn't want to spend $50+ on a quality filter. A friend of mine had suggested that I try the Sigma EX DG series of UV filters. He had a few of them and said the multi-coating and build were top quality. The price was certainly in my range. I'm glad I listened to him! I probably saved myself about 50% on what I would have spent on a Kenko Pro or Hoya equivalent. The filter arrived absolutely dust free. These Sigma UV filters are simply great!
5,Saved my D90 with 18-105mm lens,"My lens caps got squashed into my 18-105mm lens in the car's trunk. Luckily, I had this filter on the lens. The filter got broken completely, and I had shreds of glass all over my real lens' glass. It took me some time to get all the glass pieces out of the lens, but after I was done, it seems that my lens survived. Thank got I had this filter on my lens!"
5,Sigma EX DG 67mm Multi-Coated UV Filter,Great filter! Really cuts down on lens fare and is great for general protection of the front lens element of your lens. I leave it on at all times. Definitely would recommend this filter.
5,"Used to be a Hoya buyer, but I love this Sigma filter","I used to always purchase Hoya HMC filters for my previous cameras, but for the price, I wasn't too happy with some of their filters made in Philippines. I decided to give this Sigma EX DG 67mm Multi-Coated UV Filter a shot and it was perfect. The quality is excellent and so was the packaging. Will definitely start buying Sigma from now on."
4,Never buy this lens filter from Amazon.,"I bought total of two sigma lens filters from Amazon. The first one I returned as there was dust on the filter. Amazon shipped me a replacement with overnight shipping. But again the same thing happened with the other filter. I am still to receive the 52mm UV filter from amazon. I will get it by tomorrow so will post more here.One more thing to notice. There is no EX grade for this filter. Sigma only makes DG UV filter with multi-coating. So even though the title says EX, you will get DG only. I called Adorama and even they had no clue about this.P.S. I have not tested this lens yet. Once I finish testing, I will post more details. The rating are only based on my initial review of this filter."
1,Not up to par.,The sound on the second part of this DVD (Our Miss Brooks) is hardly audible and should never have been released in that condition. Turning the volume up as loud as possible the audio on the DVD can still hardly be heard. There are only 4 episodes on this DVD not really making it worth the price of the item. Very disappointing. I am disappointed also in that this item would be sold by anyone being so poorly reproduced.
1,50's TV Comedy Double Feature: Life of Riley (1949-53) / Our Miss Brooks (1953),Terrible video quality. These videos could have been enhanced like the I Love Lucy series. They should be ashamed to sell this product with this type of quality.
3,Sweet Nostalgia!,"My Mom used to always watch both of these shows, so I have sweet memories of not only the TV shows, but of time spent with my Mom. The quality of the film is somewhat degraded, but you are still able to enjoy the shows. I just wish there were more episodes available. I would buy them."
4,a good interaction of a wide collection of characters,"Scobby,Scrappy and the gang do this one really well. A wide variety of characters at Drak's castle make this very interesting along with the classical features of a Scobby Doo piece. The twist in the storey line ( when all the monsters want the gang to help them) is different and keeps the story interesting. Well done Scoob....."
3,Tar Monster Saves the Day.,"The Scrappy Doo Halloween episode really stinks but the Tar Monster episode is a real great episode(Taking place in Turkey!) I give The Scrappy episode 2 Stars, but the Tar Monster 5."
4,Classic Hanna Barbera (modern things like the Simpsons dont come lose to this),"Fantastic monsters who both help and hinder Fred, Scooby & Co. I was always looking for Dracula to be in a Scooby Doo adventure. I just ignore scrappy as he is of minor importance."
2,If you saw the version from TV,"I thought this was a more in-depth showing of the meet. But, it was exactly what was shown on CBS. So, if you happen to be buying this in hopes of seeing yourself or someone you know, forget it. That is unless, you know FOR SURE, you were on the original showing of the meet."
1,Not a complete book!,"Warning: Don't buy the slim paperback Rose's Flying Feeling, published in 2005 for World Book Day. It is simply the beginning of Caddy Ever After."
1,Beware - Product Switch,I bought 256 USBdrive from this vendor andalthough this page clearly names and shows shows a high quality USBDrive the vendor is actually shipping an Aigo unit. A flimsy low cost unit not at all comparableable to a USBDrive
4,Beautiful acoustic guitar music,"Beautiful acoustic guitar music. Very soothing and gently played.Lynn Patrick is one of my favorites.Never too slow and sleepy....and never to fast or loud.Just the right sound to work or create with....she has several CD's and I love both of the ones I have...this one and ""Winnie's Guitar"".If you love soothing and uplifting acoustic guitar, you'll love this.Classic, but not classical. :)"
3,"The Best Of Reggae Music-""The Songs Of Peter Tosh""","This is great to see Tosh's work published. Musically, the book is right on, I've found some of the lyrics to be inncaccurate however."
5,Very cute and bright shower curtain that is easy to wash in the washing machine.,This shower curtain goes wonderful in our kids bathroom. It is bright and cheerful and goes with so many other colors in the kids bathroom. Very good quality too!
5,Loved It,If you like all things Disney you will love this. The recordings are the actual ones from the films and I found that fact most enjoyable.
5,Walk down memory lane,The CDs included in this set are nice. Kind of like a walk down memory lane since it includes old and current Disney songs. It's good for the young and young-at-heart. Uploads to an iPod nicely.
1,Greedy!,Don't get me wrong! I love Dilbert... And I love Dogbert even more... But paying 5$ for a book full with below average Dilbert strips that I finished under 3 minutes isn't my idea of money well spent...Save your money and get some of Scott Addams other excellent books!
3,"Good gift book, dissapointing otherwise","The biggest dissapointment of this book was how short it was. It had only a few strips. I would have been okay with that if they had been the BEST EVER on that topic, but they were just average. I ended up giving this book to an in-duh-vidual for his retirement party. I didn't like him and didn't particularly want to give him a gift, so this was perfect. But I wouldn't buy this book for myself, and, if I was giving this as a real gift (like a birthday gift for someone I like) I would buy one of the full-length books instead."
3,"""Reader from Big Apple should learn English""",This is in regard to a comment from xxaspasiaxx in Big Apple:daltonism also Daltonism n.An inherited defect in perception of red and green; red-green colorblindness.daltonian or daltonic adj.
1,Not as Advertised :(,"I was extremely disappointed in the product I received today. Why? Because it is not what I ordered. Same title, same author, different book than advertised. It was a different cover (from ""1971"") than that of which was advertised. It's so ugly its embarrassing. Also, it is ""used"" with ink handwriting in the book, even though it was advertised as ""NEW"". $9 is not worth going through the hassle to return, however, worth warning future purchasers."
4,Tips for a new ministry.,I found it presented many thoughts for a more effective and creative ministry for today.
3,"Good principles, mediocre writing, wrong tone.","The principles in Atkinson's book are sound, and definitely will help you get finances in order. But only if you can get through the rest of the stuff to get to them. I found the ""catchy"" formulas (TD+KoRR=L and others) laborious and hard to remember. The tone was perhaps too informal, and felt somewhat condescending to me. (At one point, Atkinson calls his reader ""boophead."" Boophead?)There are many good nuggets in this book, and it's worth a perusal if your library has a copy. For a handbook to revolutionize your finances, however, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Sizing is way off,"I bought this bra primarily as a sleep bra during pregnancy. I am happy with the product's quality, but very unhappy with the fit and sizing. I am normally a 34G and purchased the 32-34 G/H size. I was a little concerned about the product being too small around the band, but it was the opposite! The bra fits with the band barely stretching at all. I have large amounts of room in the cups as well. Because the band does not 'hug' my torso and because the whole thing is stretchy anyway, the bra rides up in the back and droops in the front, providing little support. As it is, it's acceptable for a little control while sleeping, but provides nothing otherwise. I was, however, very happy with the seperation it provided which is the best I've experienced in a non-underwire bra ever. The fabric is thick cotton and is comfortable for the summer. I would recommend considering purchasing a size smaller than you would expect though."
5,My nighttime nursing bra,"I bought these as my breasts grew 5 cup sizes durning pregnancy and once my milk came in. As a 36E, it was difficult to find a sleep bra that covered everything!! I bought 2 of these, one lined, one unlined, and wore them nightly for about 18 months of nursing. They were pretty worn out and had lost most of their stretch by then end, but that was all I needed. Also, the seams are pretty bulky and uncomfortable; I solved the problem by wearing them inside out."
4,It works!,"I have tried a lot of sleep and leisure style bras but haven't found one that that is worth wearing before. I'm a 36 G. This sleep bra actually gives gentle (very) support and it actually separates the breasts and prevents sweaty skin against skin. It looks nicer than going braless under a robe or nightgown. I wouldn't wear it in public but I wear it around the house and when camping I can wear it under a sweatshirt or tee-shirt between the tent and bath-house. (I normally would never let anyone see me without a bra.) The price is right also. It is a little ""bunchy"" in the back or I would give it 5 stars. I am buying a couple more of these."
5,Best sleep bra ever.,"I have 6 of these now, 3 in white and 3 in black. I got them after my first daughter was born; the elastic makes them perfect for nursing and the material is so comfortable that when I was still tender/sensitive and didn't want to put on a more supportive(/constrictive) bra, this one was a perfect alternative. After 2 years I still wear them every night... you'll just have to try them for yourself to see how much of a difference they can make! :)PS: Please note that you'll want to use them just at night, because they really don't provide much support - just breathable material that keeps you from getting sweaty, getting rashes, or being generally uncomfortable as larger breasted women tend to without a bra at night."
2,OK....,"I must be the only one who did not find this bra fantastic. It's an okay bra. It's comfortable but it felt bulky to me. It runs a size too big. There is no support of any kind, especially if you're a little bigger.The whole bra is just too wide (the straps, the band around you, everything feels just too bulky - too much material for me).Sorry, but I'm sticking to the Medela Sleep Nursing Bra."
5,very good!,"I liked very much!very nice product, i'm satisfied, and if necessary i'll recommend! and the most important was that it arrived in the predicted time!"
5,timex kids watch,Bought this watch for my 10 yr old son. He absolutely loves it. It is truely waterproof too!!! My son swims and takes showers with this watch on. The quality is good and we have not experienced any problems at all with this product. The stretch band with velcro is very convenient.
3,My son loved this watch...while it worked,"April 2010 - I just wanted to update that this watch gave up the ghost in January. At first we thought it was just the battery, but no. We bought it in June, so that gave us about 6 months of use.November 2009 - I wanted my kids to have a watch prior to leaving for our first long road trip. I let each of them choose one from Amazon, and my son wanted this one. For the price and looks, it was a great deal. He was stumped on setting the time until we looked at the instructions. After that, he figured out the rest of the watch on his own. I like the fact that the strap is elastic, as he regularly sleeps with it. Also, the numbers are large enough that you can see them across the room. Lastly, he needs to read for at least 20 minutes daily, and he uses it to time himself. Overall, a great purchase for his first real watch."
2,BAD WATCH,"I bought this watch for my grandson for his 8th b-day. He wanted digital and told him he could have it after he learned to tell regular time, he did. He's had it less than 4 months, loves it, but it has not held up. The band is shredded, the light does not work and the face is fogged over from moisture. He sleeps, showers and never takes it off, that's how much he likes it! Timex was a watch you used to be able to depend on, not so much with this one. I would not recommend this watch to anyone, very disappointed."
2,Not water proof,"My 4 year old loved this watch, however its not water proof. First time in the pool and water was inside the case. Few days later water is gone but screen is showing unreadable numbers."
4,Cool for Kids,"Just got this watch for my son. He loves it especially the light and the fact that he can put it on without help from Mum and Dad. Regards durability it seems OK, but seven year olds can be pretty brutal. I think if you get 12 months out it you have done well. I mean it aint a Rolex."
5,Great watch for boy,My grandson loved everything about thiswatch. Camouflage material stretch bandis unique and particularly nice...easyto get off and on. Holds up well - likemost Timex watches.
1,Fogged up as soon as it hit water,"although it is suppose to be water resistant, it fogged up on the first time my son took it to the pool. after being in rice for a few hours, it unfogged, but on the second time in water it was fogged permanently..."
2,Fogged up as soon as it hit water,"My son really wanted this watch. I was hoping it would be great, but even though it said it was water resistant, as soon as it hit the bathtub it fogged up and never would unfog. We had to return it for a refund. Would not recommend."
3,It looks nice,"I bought this for my boyfriend's son for his 8th birthday. It looks nice on him, is sturdy and not babyish (which is what I was trying to avoid - He hates super heroes!). Perfect for a little sportsman :)"
4,My 2.5 year old loves it!,"I bought this watch for my 33 month old because I was tired of having to tell him to go use the restroom. I wanted to get a potty watch, but the reviews were so horrible that I thought maybe a watch with a timer would be a better option.I knew that since it was a Timex, the quality wasn't going to be an issue. I was most worried about whether it was going to fit him...and it does! We haven't been using it consistently, but he wants to wear it all the time because now he has a watch like his daddy. :)Overall it is a great watch. All the settings are easy to set. I do wish the timer would keep beeping till you pushed a button, but I get why they don't do that."
3,did not take a licking,"My 5-year-old son LOVED this watch. He wore it all the time. It was a comfortable fit on his wrist, and looked great on him. He loved the light-up dial and the buttons. Also it was water proof and he swam with it often, and didn't have to take it off to take a bath. I think this helped a lot with keeping track of it. However, it met its end when he threw it hard against the wall during a tantrum. Later that day he swam with it and it filled up with water and was ruined. Obviously he should not have treated it that way, but still the ""takes a licking and keeps on ticking"" slogan comes to mind. It would have been good if it were a little bit tougher. If treated with respect, though, I think this is a very nice watch."
1,Too complicated,"We couldn't figure out how to set it. Maybe we should have settled with an analog clock instead. For some reason, the time goes backward!"
3,good watch but the button is hard to press,"Order this watch for my 7 years old son to replace the expensive POS I got from Macy's! He really love this watch. The elastic band is comfortable according from my son, and he has a small waist. the only complain from him are these 4 side buttons, they are hard to press to make selection. other than that, he is happy and I am happy."
3,Nice While It Worked,"I really liked this watch for my son at first. It was a little difficult for him to use however. I had to pull out the directions everytime I wanted to do something. It seemed more complicated than was necessary. Ultimately, the watch is now broken--the numbers aren't showing up all the way. I know the time is still correct because the alarm I set goes off. I don't know what happened to it--it rarely left the house. Not worth replacing. Will try a different watch the next time."
2,broke in less than 6 months,"Bought for my six year old and broke way too quickly, and he took great care of it. Timex would repair for $10 plus shipping both ways or something but why re-invest in this watch? Instead got a $15 ladies digital from Target that has more features and hopefully will hold up. You can get basic, good, proven digital watches here on amazon for $10-15, that would be great for a kid."
1,Never saw the item...DELIVERY TOOK FOREVER!,This item went in circles around the US and never arrived in time for the event in which it was ordered...2 weeks later. So it was refused. Never saw the watch.
1,Watch broke and service took WAAAAY too long....,"My son was so happy to get a new Timex watch and then after about 3 weeks the Indiglo feature stopped working. I sent it back to Timex who, after a month, sent a replacement back to us. However, the replacement was the wrong version of the watch (analog vs. digital). I called and they said they would ship me a postage paid box to return the wrong watch and then they would order and send the new (correct) one. It has been another month again and I have gotten the box for the return but no new watch. I called again today and they said it would be 4 more weeks due to ""inventory"" that they have to conduct at the end of the year. Very dissappointed since I always thought of Timex as a reliable company. I will likely not buy their product again since their service has been less than stellar and the watch broke after 3 weeks."
2,"Cute, but not waterproof :(","This watch is very cute and my 8-year old was so excited to shop online and buy this with money he had saved. Unfortunately, after 3 months of wear, the whole inside of the screen was covered with fog and the time is not legible. Definitely not the quality I am used to and expect from Timex. Contacting today for warranty info."
1,Not water proof,This is the second time I have bought this watch and I will not buy it again.Both watches were ruined by water. My son did wear the watch to swim in the poolwhich is 8 feet but that is well under the limits.
4,My youngest son bought this for himself,He love's it spent his birthday money on it and is totally happy with it. The band allows him and his bother to play sports and not break it.
4,My son loved it!,Bought for my 10 year old who loves anything camo! He has has this for months now and it's still ticking!
4,Nice little watch,"liked it. nice looking for kids. not too complicated. stretch band is okay, dont now how durable it is. light and alarm works good. so far looks like a good short term watch."
2,This one is not still ticking...,"Good looking watch for my son, he loves camo! Problem is after less than 2 months, it has stopped working; not the Timex quality I have experienced in my earlier days. It is still under warranty, but they want half the cost of the watch for shipping and processing which helped me to decide to just get a different watch all together. Bottom line, this is a cool looking watch and your children will really enjoy it... for about a month."
5,The kids loved it :),bought this for my friend's kid and he absolutely loved it; great product at a reasonable price...definitely 5 stars !
5,Fasinating Insights !,"For a section of the bible, or even the gospel, that is seldom discused, preached or thought about, Peter Trumper's 302 pages of insights on the events that transpired after Jesus's resurrection is a joyful read and refreshes my soul. If Passion of Christ details the death and dying hours if not minutes of Christ's death, then ""Breakfast on the Beach"", is a must read SEQUEL to it. Much has been written on Christ's birth, ministry and cruxifixion. Not to mention alot of theology of Christ's resurrection. Its time that we pay more attention to the 40 days, Jesus was alive after crucifixion and not just all thetime on his 40 days fasting with temptations. Peter Trumper's ""Breakfast on the Beach"" is a must read for all christians."
5,Life's Too Short Really Is Too Short.,"The only bad thing about this series is it only has seven episodes. If you like Ricky Gervais and his type of humor, you'll like this fictional account of Warrick Davis's life as a little person actor. The cameos are hysterical and amazing considering how famouse these people are. It's cleverly written and has a cast of supporting characters who are all well done. I recommend it for an afternoon of laughs. There are no plans to continue the series at this time and that's a shame, becuase it is hysterical.If you don't like the British version of the Office or Extras, etc. Don't watch this, it isn't for you. If you do like those shows, jump on this one, it's right up there."
2,Meh.... so-so,"I'm a fan of Ricky Gervais's other work, both versions of The Office, and the Extras, and even An Idiot Abroad are some of my favorite comedy material--right up there with Monty Python and Office Space.But this show just falls flat. It feels like all the same old tricks, this time with Warrick Davis at the butt of the jokes.Real-life celebrity cameos? Check. Did that in Extras--and much better.Self-deprecating humor? Check. Did that in The Office and in Extras.I'm sure some people will find this series riveting. I find it dry and dull. Perhaps if I didn't already know all of Gervais's tricks, I would enjoy this show more.I ordered HBO to watch this when it first began airing. After the fourth episode, I canceled my HBO subscription.Please don't buy this unless you have already seen at least one or two episodes, and know you will enjoy it. I suggest previewing via one of the popular streaming or DVD-by-mail services, first."
5,a third album????,"the second i heard what went wrong...addicted too...and then... that girl's a slut... the band works a talent of lyrics, melody and different alternative, actually their sound ripples with the packed Parisian clubs i still go to when hearing... my music buddies play. these guys are moving somewhere fast. so you love women... a toast to the top guys, cuz...d'you know women sure love you too..."
4,Lovely..,"Having read non stop about Steve Jones (ex sex pistol)playing on this CD, I bought this, and although I found the songs a little overlong in places, it's all good stuff. The singer is goes for it! The band play hard and rockin'."
4,Its what was expected,"This video was exactly what I expected out of a Free Running movie. Similar to movies such as The Tournament or District B13, the story line and acting aren't the best, but people who watch these movies are watching for the stunts. The parkour and free running elements are great and it was worth the watch."
1,Which was worse?,"Here are the Oscar nominees for, ""Which was worst?""(a.) Totally dumb and even stolen plot/storyline. Super rich & crooked stereotypes betting on outcome and bomb collars and good guy gets girl and sailboat finalé.(b.) Acting or lack of.(c.) Parkour (i.e. freerunning). The out here is to just go youtubing and get much better runs.(d.) Cinematography and/or directing and/or editing.(e.) Script/dialogue from people who don't know what they're talking about, trying to sound like they know what they're talking about."
3,Better than I was expecting,"I bought this movie because a friend from high school is in it (Joe Zamora, who plays Miles). We had seen the poor reviews of the movie, but it really wasn't that bad! It was a typical, entertaining, blow-everything-up sort of movie that kept everyone who watched engaged and interested. Reminded me a lot of a darker/more sinister version of the movie Rat Race. Had a few problems with the physics in the movie (how does a body whose head gets blown off at the neck end up being blown over the railing of a bridge?), but as I said, overall it was an average action movie."
4,It Really Helped Me to Heal,"A friend bought me the book shortly after I had had to put my beloved cat down. The book was warm and engaging and really talked to the love and unique relationship the author had with his cat. I, too, had such a relationship. The book helped me to grieve for my loss. I loved my cat, and my first pet very much. I recommend every pet lover read this book."
5,WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?,"At one of the lowest points in my life, having just lost my beloved dog, I found Mr. Phillip Schreibman's poem ""Where Do We Go From Here?"" about his cat, Alice, which expessed so poignantly exactly what I was feeling. I was so amazed that someone else knew and understood the deep, dark pain of losing a precious companion animal! I was so moved by his poem that I contacted Mr. Schreibman by e-mail to thank him. I then discovered his book ""My Cat Saved My Life"". Reading this at just the time when I needed it most helped me through a very painful time. You will find this insightful book helpful and healing."
4,Touched My Heart,"Anyone that lives with and loves animals will be touched by this book. The author spins a lovely yarn of how the cat helped him through hard times but at one point he becomes too deeply involved in his own story of depression. I found myself skimming through that part and wanting to get on with the cat adventures. I read a lot of deep psychological selections and wanted this one for a light, easy read, uplifting evening. I did find it enjoyable."
5,"well, I loved it, at least","Maybe I'm a naturally depressed/pessimistic individual, but I love all of Kelly's music, dark and depressing or not. I love this song -- it's full of raw emotion, even if it does seem as if she's yelling some of the time. I will admit, I am biased. I voted for her during American Idol and was thrilled when she won, but only because I didn't like Justin, and her first album turned me off altogether -- I thought it was weak, overly poppy (and this is coming from a girl that loves pop music), and didn't showcase her voice well, like when she sang 'I Surrender' by Celine Dion in AI. I was absolutely stunned by the strength her voice gained, as well as the rockish edge her music gained in Breakaway, and I'm glad it's still there. I hope all of her music isn't based on personal experience, but the way she expresses pain and anger in her songs is beautiful, and I hope her career lasts for some time to come."
3,Darker side of Kelly,"Kelly Clarkson returned this year with the darker sound of ""Never Again"", a song full of anger and hate. Vocally she has never sounded better. While I prefer Kelly singing pop instead of rock, it is still a listenable song that takes Kelly in a deeper direction than we are use to hearing her sing. I think it's better than ""Walk Away"" or ""Since U Been Gone"" (both I thought were highly overrated). Overall a nice and welcome return from Kelly Clarkson. I reccomend this if you like Kelly Clarkson but are looking for a different sound from her."
3,could have given us both full length remixes...,this lame release gives us the LP version and the Dave Aude edit. I don't understand WHY the record company couldn't have just put the full length Dave Aude mix and the full length Jason Nevins mix on this CD single.
2,Same ole same ole,"To be fair, Ive heard a couple other songs from My December and I was more impressed with those. But ""Never Again"" is nearly unlistenable. Her last huge hit ""Since You Been Gone"" and to a degree ""Walk Away"" were break up...Im over you...I dont need you songs. Now we get another angry break up song. Are we going to be subjected to this torture all over again every time Kelly has another break up? The chorus to Never Again comes across as whiney and screechy, and I swear, even after hearing the song several times, I cannot remember the melody to the verses. ""Never Again"" does not show any growth as a songwriter and its no wonder the single fell out of the top 10 so fast. Obviously Im not the only one with a bad opinion of this song. But to her credit, the song ""Sober"" which radio is now occasionally playing, though Im not sure if it has been officially released as a single, is a much better song. Lets hope that ""Never Again"" is just a minor blip on the cd."
