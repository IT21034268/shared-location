3,"Good audio & mic pick-up, but failed with an internal fault","I used this headset daily for telephone conversations. I was very pleased with the quality and volume of sound, and I never had any complaints regarding my volume from the microphone. I also found the headset comfortable to wear for extended conversations. The cord is somewhat long for this application and I found it getting in the way a lot.After only a few months of this usage the microphone stopped working. The product has a ""lifetime warranty"" from Koss but that involves shipping the product to them plus a $9 fee. All together that's pretty close to half the original retail cost of the product. I have currently replaced it with the Yapster TekNMotion TM-YB100A headset, which is delivering comparable results for about $10 less than the original cost of the Koss. I'd prefer the Koss product overall, but I need a product that stands up to use over time."
2,I wish I could find headsets that last longer than a few months,I was never thrilled with the audio. It always seemed a bit muffled. Now after 4 months the microphone has died (I almost never used it but the microphone connection wire to the unit is frayed) and the sound periodically goes out as the headphone connection is also going bad. I'd pay extra money if I knew connections were robust on a headphone but reviews don't talk about that.The warranty might be lifetime but you have to mail it back at your own expense AND also include 9 dollars after which they might decide it is your fault and not the product's fault.The rest of the unit is pretty solid -- it is just those connections that are not!
3,Broken microphones,"My brother got a set for his birthday last year, loved them so much I got myself a pair a month later. They both worked pretty well, no problems until about a month ago. Both microphones stopped working. Contacted Koss, they have a lifetime warranty, but you have to pay shipping yourself. Considering that both mics failed in 6 months, simultaneously. We won't bother getting them repaired. Hopefully the Plantronics GameCom 367 will fair better!"
4,Good Product,"Good product for the price. Sound quality is excellent for both the headphones and the mic.The only con I have is that the ear cups are not large enough or deep enough for those of us with larger ears, so they tend to get uncomfortable after 2-3 hours gaming."
3,You get what you pay for,"These seem fine initially, but over time they start to wear and eventually breakdown on me. I've typically bought cheap headphones <$40, and it's always the same - a small cash outlay up front but you'll be replacing them frequently. I finally decided to step up to some Sony MDR-v6 (senn hd280 basically the same thing) and don't regret a thing. If this is all you can afford right now and you need headphones then it's fine, but IME, you shouldn't expect them to hold up too long."
3,Koss,"OK for the money but don;t plan on wearing them for long. They are fairly uuality is OK, for movies I don;t recommend them,in fact for listening I don;t recommend them for more than an hour or so. The mic is fair, definitely not great. They look good, the cord is long and the mic flips out of the way. I guess I would say fiar, but you can buy smaller more comfortable ones for a lot less."
3,Goog but tight on the ears,The sound on these is great but they hurt my ears as they are too tight on the head.
5,"astounded, i am","The Koss SB-45 Communication Stereophones are sold for a very modest price. The lightweight comfort matched by its ""sturdy-enough-build"" make these stereophones surprisingly delightful. Not to mention the sound is beyond clear for the price range, and the bass mysteriously clever.Comfort: 5Price: 5Microphone sound 4.5Speaker sound: 5"
2,"Good initially for a few months, and then the microphone died.","This headset worked very well for a few months, but all of a sudden, the microphone stopped working when I needed it the most. If the microphone hadn't died, I would have given it at least 4 stars."
2,"Thin wire, leads to broken mic","Good sound, and good mic - but the wire is pretty flimsy. I figured it would break within a year when I got it (it was a gift), and sure enough, 8 months later, the mic broke. Too bad too, the sound quality was pretty decent."
4,Using for home office,"This has been wonderful for everyday use in my home office. I do a lot of video conferencing as well as VoIP calls. I basically wear this headset 6-8 hours a day and it is super comfortable. The only exception is sometimes my glasses dig under the headset, but that is probably more about my glasses.When I am not on the phone or in meetings, I use it to listen to music. The quality is amazing! I recently even took it on a plane trip and shoved it in a bag and did not have to worry about being over delicate with it.The only thing that I am undecided on is if I would like to be able to remove the boom.Also, I would like it if I could use it with a 2.5"" jack on my home wireless. I realize it wouldn't be true ""stereo"" sound, but I like having both ears covered to cancel out the noise. I bought an adapter with it but the adapter is a bit scratchy :/. When/iftbis ever goes out, I will most likely purchase another."
4,Decent headphones.,"I'm a hardcore and wanted a cheap headset and this one satisfied my need. My friends can hear me clearly through the mic and I can hear them fine through the headphones. The headphones do leak sound out of them so if you play music or something loud and don't want people to hear, this is probably not the best."
2,Faulty mic,"This product was a complete disappointment. As soon as I got it, I plugged it into my computer only to find out the microphone doesn't work.I tried several different programs to find and pick up the mic but nothing worked.The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because the headphones are pretty good.I recommend spending your money elsewhere if you're looking for a headset that actually works."
1,Mike fails immediately,"I bought these based on the product name which apparently was a mistake. The mike began failing within a week, if would only function with the cable taped to the headphone to imoblize it. the next week it failed completely leaving me with a pretty good set of headphones. Nice but I already have a nice set of headphones. Will not buy form Koss again."
1,Cord split within 2 months of ownership.,Very disappointing for a product that's pretty much decent except for the crappy cord. 2 months and then the cord breaks? UGH!
3,I CAN'T HEAR ME NOW.,"My old head set with mic was uncomfortable, so i thought i would get a new one. I use it to talk long distance with the lap top. The koss head phones are comfortable enough and the sound is ok. However i can not hear myself in the head phone speakers. Idont know if this is a design flaw or what. The discription does not say anything about it, nor does the instrutions.I guess you get what you pay for, although it seems like koss missed the mark on these."
2,mediocre if that,"Worked great for about a month. Started getting static in the headset then the sound was completely gone. Tried to repair it from the volume control but the quality of it was so bad, had to just trash it. Here now looking for a new set :/"
2,Decent headset while they lasted,"I bought this Koss Headset on a lark without too much research, I just wanted a decent (yet affordable) set of headphones with mic for my computer. I knew it only had an analog stereo connection but I thought this would give me more flexibility in case I wanted to use it for my iphone/mp3 player. The sound was decent and the mic worked good but then the mic stopped working altogether after a couple months. After that, the sound on the right speaker would occasionally stop until I unplugged and replugged the stereo jack back in. My assessment is that these headphones just seem to be made cheaply without much thought into making them last."
3,okay sound but quite heavy and get sweaty easily.,"Bought this and has been using it for 2 days. Perhaps my fault, but I underestimated how heavy this product could be. It also fit pretty tight, and the area around ear get sweaty quickly.The sound quality is okay, but has a noticeable drop off from porta pro in my opinion. If you like bass heavy music/effect you may not like this too much.The mic is nice, but your voice may be distorted a tiny bit, like having a electronic tinge(not static) to it if you know what i mean. kind like you are speaking from a news or recording studio. could be nice if you like that stuff."
4,Great microphone until it died,"I used this microphone somewhat regularly for recording online training videos until it died recently. I had to check my Amazon purchase date to see how long I had it. I bought it in July 2007 and it stopped working in September 2010 so I guess I should be happy I got 3 good years of use (did I do my math correctly? Math was never my strongest subject!)I now use the Audio-Technica (Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB Microphone) microphone and it's MUCH better. Also more expensive but I'm very satisfied.The Koss headset worked for what I needed but I have now graduated on to better equipment.Please see my other reviews to see some cool audio stuff that I bought on Amazon. And if you find my information helpful, please vote and let me know!"
4,great deal for the price,This is a great headset and is very comfortable for me. Not only does it have a good price it also comforms to my head very easily.
4,Good headset for the price,"PROS: Good sound quality, very reasonable price, in-game I can hear others and they can hear me.CONS: Fit is too snug, mic pics up background noises easily. Feels very flimsy compared to headphones that cost more.This is my first head-set. As far as headphones go, I usually prefer production quality($60-$120)and own many headphones including Sennheiser and Sony MDRs. However I needed a quick gaming-headset solution. I'm content with my purchase and feel I received exactly what I paid for(31.31 after tax and Prime S&H;). They actually sound better then my $40 Audio Technica headphones. Conclusion: if it had cost $10 more, I would have given it 3 stars instead of 4."
2,Broken mic,"The mic on my unit broke after 2-3 months of use. It just stopped working and so I ended up getting it's big brother, the SB-49. I posted a review on that product after 6 months of use and I highly recommend that instead of this. It's about the same price (sometimes less!) and has better features."
1,Microphone does not work at all,Ordered this set to use for language program and the microphone absolutely does not work......I mean at all....I should have read the reviews...do not order this product if you actually want to use if for what it was supposedly made for!
1,koss,"Well I have to say, for the first month I've had these, they where great, clear sound and voice. But sadly, they are just a useless as all the other headsets w/ mics. One month in and the mic doesn't work at all. I treated this item like it was made of solid gold, and still it is a failure in quality control department. Is everything made in China now? I bought this item based on other customer comments and a bit of web research. I think I'll stick to the cheap $15 headsets, they last about the same.Koss SB-45 Communication Stereophones"
2,disappointed,"I bought this after reading good reviews, but unfortunately the microphone stopped working within one and half months. The headphone is comfortable on ears and sound quality is good. One disadvantage is that it does not have a volume control. And of course microphone malfunction within a few weeks of buying it makes it worthless for me."
5,Works Great For The Price!,"Received item for online class that I had to take. I used it for 9+ hours for the week. Was very comfortable and instructor was able to hear me clearly. Glad I bought this product vs. the others that I was planning to buy. Koss products have been known for a long time now and I am happy that I made this purchase. I plan to use this headset for future conferencing needs, Skype, etc."
3,"Sound is good, but the mic isn't","I use this headset almost everyday. The sound is quite good. I like it very much. However, I don't like the mic, especially for its poor connection. After only using it for a week, its starts to have unstable connection with my computer, and it often takes me may times of twist-and-turn to get it connected."
3,Ok,"This headset is an ok headset if you are not wanting to do a lot of gaming. I bought them in October of 2011 and they broke in March of 2012 from continual use. They do provide good sound, but nothing to write home about."
3,should have opted for better looking/quality headphones,"decent pair of headphones i guess, i don't know about the 25 dollar price, 10-15 dollars seem reasonable for this pair. would have defintely opted for a more expensive high quality headset/headphones but decided to give these a try because they were cheaper, frame and pads are kinda flimsy and could probably break in the future. mic quality is superb though."
2,Works great but only for a while,"I this because it was cheap and seemed comfortable and good for a variety of things. When I first got it, it was wonderful. Lived up to expectations fully. Then, well, then things went bad. After only about 6 months of use, the microphone died. And from looking at other reviews, it's happened to a few other people too. But the headset still worked for listening. That's when the ear piece just broke off one day when I was putting them on. Just broke off in my hand. The set is now garbage and useless. I would recommend a more durable, lasting headset over this one. It had so much potential."
2,"Worked fine, for a short time.","Purchased 3 of these for online classes. Have had them for 4 months now. After 3 months, the microphone stopped working on one. After one more month, the mic on another one stopped working. Headphones sound great, but even on the third headset that is still working, people complain occasionally about the sound quality of the microphone when hearing it on the other end. I suspect there is a design problem with them them that causes an eventual loose connection, and then a total failure of the microphone after a while."
1,Didn't Last,"The microphone stopped working after 10 months. I think this is unacceptable--even a low priced product like this one should last at least a year. This is my first Koss purchase and I doubt I'll be making another. I noticed that the wire is very flimsy where it attaches to the headset itself, and the earphones were very hot and uncomfortable. I'm going back to my Logitech."
2,"They are now great, overpriced headphones with no mic","Worked great at first. After several months of infrequent use, the mic stopped working. Would suggest spending more for a better quality product and/or purchasing a warranty."
2,Too tight,"The headset is too tight for my head (and head width is not that wide). There is no way to adjust the width. It is tight enough to give me a headache. I would not recommend this. (P.S. I normally don't write reviews, but I got so fed up with the discomfort that I had to write this.)"
4,A good buy for the price,"Bottom line up front: I got these specifically for online gaming and chat, and they're not a disappointment for the price.These headphones look cheap, but not flimsy. There's plenty of padding, so they're not as uncomfortable as you might expect for their weight. They are a bit stiff out of the box, and don't adjust very easily. I'm anticipating the opposite problem, once the plastic gets a bit worn-in.The microphone is just as good as it should be for on-line chats and gaming. The cans themselves sound pretty good. My other set of headphones are Bose Triports, which sound very good, and are over-priced at about $80 more than these. These headphones sound about $50 worse than the Bose. So, not bad. If my other headphones are in the next room, and these are handy, I'll use them to listen to music without annoying myself."
4,Good Headset,"The headset is a very good one indeed. The microphone is definitely what I was looking for when I looked at this headset. It may seem that he microphone is too far away from your mouth, but the input that my friends received were excellent. The sound is also great, the bass is nice and the sound is very clear. It is a very comfortable headset.The only problem, which is why I set it at 4 stars is because of the feeling on my ears after awhile of wearing them. It puts pressure on my ears so sometimes after long use my ears ache a little, though it only hurts when being pushed on or when you put the headphones back on. I've had it for about a month now and it seems that I've gotten adjusted to the headphones and my ears don't hurt anymore after long use.The shipping was a day before I expected it to arrive and it was nicely boxed and handled. No problems at all."
4,A good pair of headphones for the price,"I picked up a pair of these headphones a couple weeks ago. I work from home a couple times a week and use them to connect to meetings via a voice-over-IP phone application.* Sound quality is good* Comfortable, even after a couple hours* Mic placement is good -- not in the way (though not adjustable)I gave this product 4 stars. It would earn 5 stars if the manufacturer would have added a small, innocuous feature: the ability to hear a little bit of your own voice through the headphones (like with your telephone).When speaking, your own voice is muffled and this takes some getting used to. You are never quite sure if people can hear you. It's rather unsettling.But overall, these headphones are very good. I don't play PC-based video games, so can't rate them there - but for phone calls/meetings, they work very nicely."
3,"Worked great, for 3 months","This was my first quality headset. I don't have much to compare it to, but the sound quality was good, and it was comfortable. Unfortunately, about 3 months after I purchased the SB45, the left earpiece spontaneously died. I had not treated it roughly, and there was no gradual degradation. It just stopped working. While there is a lifetime warranty, paying for shipping would cost almost as much as buying a new one."
2,"Broken microphone, right out of the box - twice","Everything fine with these, comfort, sound is adequate, but we've had two sets with broken microphones. Tried on several machines (mac), all same.The first unit failed after a couple of days of use, the second one had an inoperative mic right out of the box. Returning for a refund this time, not willing to waste any more time."
3,Okay Overall,"The main problem I've found with this headset is that it is terrible for someone with glasses. The earphones fit very snug and that means they press my glasses into my temples rather hard; this gets painful after a while. Another smaller issue for me is that adjustment system. It's very hard to adjust the headset just how you want it without one side being off and the headset feeling crooked.Other than that the sound quality is good for both the microphone and the earphones (I bought this headset to use mainly for Skyping with my husband), and the whole product seems to be pretty well-made."
3,Headphones great - Microphone not!,"I bought this headset few months ago. Since the very beginning I have had a big problem with the microphone. It doesn't work well. I have tried it many times and specially when using it for example skype, to talk with friends - they can barely hear you and many people I know have the exact same problem with the headset. The sound quality when listening to music, playing or just talking is amazing. That is the only good thing about this product. That and the fact that when wearing it, it's quite comfortable. But yeah if you are looking for a good headset with a microphone - don't bother buying. It is not good and I have tried every possible thing to correct it."
3,not as advertised,"i read lots of good reviews and bought this item there are good and bad things about it here they arepros: good sound quality, easy to set up, good microphone reception with a problemcons. these things squeeze your head like you are in a vise its painful on your ears and head and the microphone isn't adjustable, it just falls down, loud degree of echoing on the microphoneall in all its not a good buy i could have just got a cheap $10 desktop mic and $5 headphones and it would've been much more comfortable rather than paying $25 and and $15 for 3 day shipping which ended up taking 5 days i've bought stuff at amazon before and it was good but this is the worst things i bought on this site"
3,Not suited for long periods,"These worked great as a just a headset, if you want to skype with friends and family, but I wouldn't recommend these for prolonged use. If you're going to use these for long gaming sessions or try to use them as your main headphones, they'll start to hurt your ears. I don't have especially large ears, either."
2,Not that great after all,"Mine broke after a half year or so. All of a sudden the mic stopped working practically at the middle of conversation. Considering that I have explicitly used the microphone barely longer than 20 hours I'd say it's not very long life-time. Mind you the usage was moderate - once the headset was plugged in last Fall it mostly lied on the corner of my desk.While the headset was working the performance was okay. The sound was good (and still is) but, as many note in their reviews, the headset is somewhat tight so it gets uncomfortable after an hour or two.Overall, I am less than impressed."
1,Microphone doesn't work at all.,"I bought the headset, configured the sound and all of that. Only to find out that the microphone doesn't work, which was my initial use of buying this. I can't Skype, I can't do anything. I bought $50 headphones. Waste of money."
3,IT HAS GROWN ON ME,I used to hate this one but I kept watching it and watching it and watching and now I like it a lot but it is not classic Scooby Doo however it shows some clips from old episodes which is a bit of a plus.There are still some funny stuff in this video but for older t.v. fans. Lots of seventies t.v. spin offs that make the movie better than it looks.Overall this is not bad could have been better could have been worse. I loved the Groove!!! Mildly recommended.
1,"Please skip this one, you'll thank me","In order to watch this, one must be strapped to a chair with eyes taped open. It's that bad. I'm a fan of Scooby, but this was easily the worst of the bunch I've seen. The story is plodding, the jokes aren't funny, I spent most of the time looking at the clock waiting for it to be over, and the nicest thing I can say about it is that it ended. It's essentially all about how Scooby doesn't fit well in any other Hollywood role but that of crime-fighter with the gang. If you are looking for a good Scooby movie to enjoy, avoid this one and The Reluctant Werewolf. Try Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island; it's a bit scarier than the average Scooby, but the kids love it and you won't need to be duct taped to your recliner to watch it."
3,7th day of Christmas 2012 review,"On the 7th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Scooby Goes to Hollywood. The story is not great but pretty good. The songs are cheesy yet enjoyable. The ""Shorts"" however slow the movie down and severe little-to-no purpose. The references are either dated or obvious. The mortal and the ending while good,are phoned in a mile away. The animation is pretty good for a Scooby film at the time. The voice-acting is dead-on good. Overall,it's not good but it's not bad either. Watch it if you are a hardcore Scooby fan. I give this movie a 5 out of 10."
2,Not a Scooby Mystery,My Kids both six yrs old did not like this. Not a Scooby Mystery. Only featured Shaggy and Scooby in stupid scenarios.
3,Not the best ever,"I am a HUGE scooby doo fan. So I went out and bought this. Here's my review. PROS: some cheerful music montages, good voice acting, and nice bonus features. CONS: no monsters, terrible storyline, I hardly know half the guest stars, ad it's sad that scooby almost decided to leave the gang:("
1,Memory resident virus!,Don't put this disc into a computer. You have a chance that it will not come back on. The movie it self is not very good for a scooby doo movie.
5,Another knock out by Scooby Doo,everybody who knows me knows I love me some Scooby Doo.Scooby is My Favorite&I never miss a episode&watch ever show.this one is fun&like the others I always enjoy the how they end.SCOOOOBYYYY DOOOOOOO!!!!!!
1,I really hate this DVD - got rid of it ASAP,"too many references for a small child to understand.Bad dialog, stupid story. We love Scooby - but we like real stories and not just weird crap ideas to perpetuate cultural stupidity."
3,"Ok, Scooby Movie",This film is ok. It is not one of Scooby's better movies. This film is my least favorite in the Scooby series. I do have it on VHS & DVD so I could have them all. I am only five to six DVDs away from having all of the Scooby DVDs. The only reason that I suggest buying this DVD is to have them all.
3,Good but not typical Scooby,I liked it because I like all Scooby but it is not typical of the Scooby theme. No mystery to solve. Really is about Scooby trying to start a movie career in Hollywood. Kind of stupid theme but cute.
3,"OK for adult nostalgia, bad for kids who love classic Scooby","This movie seems for for adults than children. It explores Scooby's ""career crisis"" and brings back some nice flashbacks with the old gang. But my 5-yr-old, who loves the classic Scooby (and even Zombie Island and the Reluctant Werewolf), didn't like this one."
2,Scooby hollywood,"The picture showed that it was a 3 DVD package when I got it, it was only one DVD and I don't think it was what I was lead to believe it was suppose to be."
3,I Ron't?,"On the feature (2/5):If this movie can contain Scooby's best moments, as it is really funny and very clever (Scooby Doo dressed up like John Travolta in a parody of Woody Allen's Radio Days), it can also be quite repetetive and can easily be considered as a pretty flawfull montage of all the Scooby Doo gags from all prior episodes and series. In a few words, you have seen this many times before.On the DVD Edition (5/5):I didn't expected with such a cheap price all this bonus features.""Scooby Doo Yearbook"" A 15 minutes insight look to all the Scooby Doo creative process, from how it was born to how they chose all those great actors to perform the Mystery Inc.Gang. With appearances of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera themselves."
3,Just Another Love Story,"The Mother of His Son focuses on the relationship of Beth and Luke. Due to a grouchy grandmother, Beth and Luke are separated for sixteen years. After sixteen years, Beth receives a phone call about her father's deathbed wish and rushes home with her fifteen year old son, Ryan. After a few weeks, Luke and Beth reaffirm their love. The story drags in places and never really achieves the momentum it needs to be a great story. Most of the plot is predictable and the characters do not have a lot of depth. After sixteen years apart, they should have shown more emotion. The story is not very realistic and loses the reader at times."
4,Nice shoes,"Fit quite narrow through the toes and balls of the feet, were painful when I first tried them on. They are getting better as I break them in. Good materials and comfort otherwise, good color and somewhat funky design. Maybe I just have weird feet. Might be cautious though if you have wide feet."
2,Excellent Fiction book about Charles Ponzi,"The fact is, here aren't many books out there about Ponzi and his scheme. Dunn's book has been around since 1975 and is a ""novelistic"" approach to Ponzi's life and scheme. It is a fun read and I recommend it. There are also some great, now hard to find, black and white photos of Ponzi in the book. This book should have 5 stars. Somehow my review shows only 2."
1,1 star for the DVD transfer not the film.,Fun movie with terrific performances but sadly the DVD is not in widescreen. At first I thought maybe it wasn't shot that way but clearly it was. A shame.
2,"The ""inolvidable"" Santos colon","I met santos Colon in PR when i was a kid, and just before his death in Isla verde PR.he was as smooth as was his voice,He is missed for su beautiful voice and his music.No one comes close to him. We will always keep you in our heerts,Mr Santos Colon Forever."
1,useless...,very antiquated info. title and publication date are misleading and false. should be taken off sale. even free is not worth of reading time.
4,"Good, but not perfect","This thing work as advertised, I just wish they had put a little more thought into the design. Because this is a round seat, there isn't a lot of real estate to begin with, so when there is the huge hump on the back of the seat (containing all the ""stuff"") it makes the seat pretty uncomfortable. Basically, my back is right up against the hump and I feel like I am being pushed forward. I have seen other models that work as well but are a lot slimmer, so I think they could have minimized the size a little better, or at least pushed the stuff back a little further. If I had it to do over again, I would replace my toilet with an elongated bowl and get the elongated version of this seat. Like I said though, mechanically it works great."
5,Are you sure you need this?,"I bought this control along with aK&H; Lectro Soft Outdoor Bed, Large. I was afraid that the bed was designed for much colder weather and would be too warm for my cats to comfortably sleep on. It turns out that the thermostatic control built into the bed works very well- the bed has maintained a perfect temperature for my cats, day and night.If you're considering buying this control, do yourself a favor and give the bed a try for a week without it. If your pet frequently moves on/off the bed, then you could consider buying it- but most likely you'll discover the bed works perfectly without it."
4,Purchased for wood stove fan,The service guy wanted $45 for the same thing. Works as well as the old one that the tenants took with them.
3,Ten dollars cheaper under the name Dial-A-Temp,"Can buy this ten dollars cheaper on Amazon, just type in Dial-A-Temp. Have not used it yet, bought for a heating pads for my older dogs."
2,Works well with fans,"I bought this controller to reduce the heat output on K&H; Lectro Kennel heated pads. I have both a large and a medium pad. This controller did not significantly lower the heat output on either pad.Testing to see if it was working, I found it did work well in reducing the rotational speed of electric fans, so I would recommend it for that."
2,no temperature rising,"I can't see that the thermostat made any difference in the temperature of my dog's heated bed warmer; unless the sun hits it, it just stays the same, no matter what."
2,Condition not great,"Was a gift. It's an old copy so it couldn't be in perfect condition, but I expected a little better."
3,a neat little book,"It is not a terribly in depth training manual, but it shows you how to train some dog tricks. If you really want to train your dog to do tricks, in addition to this book, get a gook on raising and training a puppy. That will give you some insight into the dog and how to effectively train, and this book shows the actual methods for specific tricks, a chapter most training books forgot. All in all, it is a neat little book well worth $8."
1,If you like wasting time then its a good buy,"It has so few tricks, I mean, 25?! Any other training book comes with so much more for around the same price! The Idiot's guide to Dog tricks has much more interesting, easy to learn tricks. My Smart Puppy is a great read too."
5,what can I say>>>>,What can I say this is probably the best album ever. The Ramones are my beatles and this is an album I will listen to over and over.
4,Great F'n Album,"What an incredible album, true punk rock at it's best. I feel like I'm listening to a history book with this, foreshadowing what was to come in the next decade and a half. Puts modern ""punk"" rock to shame."
2,Angry,"I'll expect that this edition will arrive with the exterior box, but it just arrived as a simple Cd. The other cover, was the reason why i bought it. I was very angry."
5,raw genius,"This record changed music forever.It gave every freak, geek and outsider something to relate to.The Ramones made it to where any punk with a guitar and problems could just say what they had to say. They gave a voice to the silent masses.Rejects,losers, and others, this is who you are and what you have went through. [....]"
2,the mix leaves out the guitar,"beware -- the remastering has removed most of johnny ramone's messy, wonderful guitar! really a drag."
2,ramones play heavy metal,"the ramones ain't a punk band, they are a hard rock heavy metalband. and all the songs on this album are heavy metal style.joey ramone still sings the same voice thogh jonny ramone playselectric heavy metal guitar. the ramones always were a rock androll band."
1,Maybe they should have just one song,"Seriously, every song in this album sounds the same. They can't sing and have managed to figure out one way to express music. By droning out the same, tired guitar sequence while ushering in their strange half talk/half mumble singing style, with lyrics that no one can understand, or would want to. Absolute trash and over hyped garbage."
3,RAMONES PLAY HEAVY METAL,The Ramones aren't a punk band. They are a hard rock heavy metal band. And all the songs on this album are heavy metal style. JoeyRamone still sings the same voice though Johnny Ramone plays electric heavy metal guitar. The ramones always were a rock and roll band just like these metal bands GUNS N ROSES NIRVANA SCORPIONS AND METALLICA.ramones play metal ramones play metal ramones play metal ramones play metal.
5,"A great first album, that is pure Punk Rock.","Punk is not neccessarily politics, or a fashion statement. It's a state of mind, and the Ramones show this in their original release. All of the album is great, fast Punk, or Rock, whatever you want to call it,(just not Metal!!)it has all of the favourites. This is an absolute must have for Ramones fans, or people who want to get into real Punk, not that Blink 182 and Good Charlotte crap."
5,NYC best record,The Ramones are probably the best punk band ever for many (for me it's the Descendents!) and this is their best record! Why do I like this record? First of all it is a funny album! Catchy and snoozy so I highly suggest this record!
3,Beating A Dead Chord,"This albums is a very good example of simplistic and repetitious lyrics, and the bludgeoning of the same three guitar chords. But why did this album get three stars? This album, while simple and stupid, plain and simply rocks. This album is filled with don't-give-a-damn rockers. If you want an album you can just rock out to and not pick apart all of the negative aspects of, I recommend this album for you. Stear clear if you accept nothing short of John Lennon lyrics."
3,Punk close to it's finest,"This is a great album... but the Ramones were not the first punk band, and anyone who tells you different shouldnt even be listening to punk.... if you want to roots, go back to the early 70s and last 60s and pick up iggy and the stooges, the MC5, and the new york dolls... but this album is really good... personal favorite is 53rd and 3rd... I also recommend getting the book, please kill me, it is like the punk bible."
3,Pop punk proficiency,"Best served in small doses of humble pop punk which can in fact regularly transcend their amateur-garage roots, the band's severe limitations sounded far less tolerable when enjoyed as a whole release."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS THE WORST MARIO GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's to easy to beat and it's boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,rare CD found,"I've always liked Bread, and had a couple of their albums on vinyl, but no means to play them. I checked out 2 on-line sites, 2 used music stores, and 2 new music stores. Nobody had it. I googled it, and there it was on Amazon! The CD is clean and free of scratches and plays perfectly. I ripped it to my desktop & laptop, and put it on my Zen."
5,The best of bread,"This is a wonderful C.D. the singing is great and the music beautiful.The order was despatched quickly and arrived in good condition. We have played it many times and had to put it away before we wore it out. BUT the music is so beautiful, it will no doubt be in our C.D. player again soon."
5,great music,I love this cd. The musical ballads take me back to the 70's and the way music was then. all the great ballads with lyrics you could relate to and understand. they were one of my favs in the 70s and still are.
5,Still great music,"for those of us who enjoyed this music the first time around, it just seems to get better. A great collection of their finest. Thanks guys!"
5,Excellent Album,"If you're a Bread fan, then you'll love this album. I grew up with Bread and this took me back to the 70's....in a good way."
5,Best of Bread,"You won't be disappointed, you will know every work on the CD....it is the resident CD in my car player"
4,better than previous 1 cd best of.,has all the hits and includes one of my favorite Bread tunes not on the previous best of-Friends & Lovers.plus the sound is MUCH better
4,Remember when...,"This album was so wonderfully refreshing. It took me back to the days when you could listen to music without profanity, vulgarity....or R A P !!I felt I was back in high school, where life was fun and easy and my whole future was ahead and brilliant.I loved this album back then, and I still do."
1,Awful,"This is the absolute worst of the 70's. For those of us who grew up during this decade, this album is one of those we'd rather forget. Disco had a longer shelf life and at least enjoyed a ""comeback"".Just for fun at your next party of 40ish YO friends - put on this album, a John Denver album, and a Donna Summer album. Measure the flak you receive in decibles and ounces of food thrown at you per song. This album wins hands down. ""Convoy"" by C.W. McCall might be the only song to rival ""Diary"" as the ultimate party killer."
1,These guys were so weak,"Thanks, Bread, you ushered in an era of Air Supply, Christopher Cross, Toto and Chicago. And for that, these guys are to be revered? Gimmee a stinkin' break. Rock music was at its worst in the early '80s, and it's these shaggy-haired hippies that are solely responsible. Thank goodness the world was soon saved by Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Styx, AC/DC and Dokken. For without those groundbreaking metal bands, we'd still be saddled with the dusky '70s boredom that is Bread.Avoid this sluggish ""rock"" at all costs, and instead pick up anything Motley Crue or Judas Priest.ROCK AND ROLL SHAN'T NEVER DIE!!!!!!!!!"
4,Fantastic Recording,"A fantastic concert film for fans of either Gorgoroth or black metal in general. As far as black metal concert video's go, the sound and video quality is amazing. The mix was very good. Every instrument comes through perfectly clear. The show its self is great, a realy good overview of the bands musical history (although nothing from the new album as it was filmed in 2004). The special features were very good also, especialy the bio's, as i was very happy to discover the make of guitar Infernus uses (Eugen for those interested).Not much more I can say realy, as most black metal concert dvd's are of extreamly low audio/video fidelity (possibly deliberatly so), this stands out as being one of the best I have seen."
1,crappy dvd,"the guitar sound is awful & they are not a very tight band,you can barley hear the drums,the video quality is good,i would only recommend this for hardcore fans as there are many better black metal dvds out now..."
4,Husband loves it,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he was ecstatic! It shipped in the time frame it was supposed to. Everything was great. Very happy with this purchase.
1,item arrived damaged from amazon,"nice item, but arrived with a ""security tag"" inside that needed to be peeled off before giving it as a gift. Upon SLOWLY peeling the security tag, it damaged the leather inside the coin holder. I still gave it as a gift, because I bought something else to replace it but the damage to the leather wasnt bad enough to send it back (they didn't have any more on Amazon at the time)."
2,"Doesn't really work, and doesn't last very long either","I picked one of these up at a long store a few years ago. We've used it only a few times and it never really seemed to have much of an effect on the temps of the contents. No more so than a cheap cooler bag would've. Finally, this last trip, the motor just gave out altogether and now it won't even switch on. Seems of poor quality"
4,battery review,Although it didn't come as fast as I thought it should considering we paid the extra shipping it's a fine battery!
3,The Music Makes the Movie,"This is an interesting film with an inspiring message that explores the faith of three children who believe they have seen ""The Virgin Mary"", the mother of Jesus in a grotto, out in the fields of their property in 1917, during the early stages of Communist oppression in Portugal. The highlight of the film is the miracle segment towards the conclusion. The great film composer Max Steiner proves once again that good music can help turn a weak film into a rather good one. Although Steiner borrows from works such as the Bach-Gounod ""Ave Maria"" and several well known Catholic hymns, he manages to masterfully blend them well with his own original score and it certainly had the effect of helping to bring tears to my eyes, especially during the miracle segment. The film is defenitely worth the ""price of admission."""
4,faith,Ok this movie i bought for my mother which yes i did watcch with her. I think it is a well made movie based on the events in this movie .
4,K of C Council Member,"Excellent movie - we showed it as part of a Dinner and Movie program for Charity. The audience did not take their eyes off the screen and even enjoyed the humorous moments. I had watched the movie as a child with my parents and was amazed that the vast majority of the audience had never seen it. The best review that can be given is that at the conclusion of the movie the entire audience applauded and the comments were all very favorable. Their survey forms stated that they wanted to see more movies just like ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima""."
3,I didnot see this movie for almost 20 years!,"I remember watching this movie every Mother's Day when I was younger, but it has been off television for many years now......It seemed like it took a while for it be on DVD......well...I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and i am very glad I bought it..."
2,"One star for the film, one for Gilbert Roland","This film is much like Song Of Bernadette. What this film lacks is a good cast, a good script, and good direction. I very much enjoyed Song Of Bernadette but this film is so poorly done it became hard to watch. I found Gilbert Roland the only reason to watch the film; to watch it as a film that is, not as a confirmation of faith. Whatever you believe or disbelieve about the event in the film can you actually imagine the Virgin Mary would appear and say the Russians are bad people? Of course we were in the middle of what was called the cold war when the film was made and the Russians were the bad guys, but I laughed out loud and began to enjoy the film because it was so bad it became funny. Viewed just as a film, this was horrible. I gave it two stars only for Gilbet Roland, even out of place in this poor film he was an actor I admired.If you are a person of faith you will probably like this film, but if you are a fan of classic films pass on it."
1,Poor casting ruins the movie,The girl playing Lucis is much too old for the part.She looks like she is l4 or 15 years old. The realLucia was only ten years old at the time of theapparitions. The other two children are extremelypoor actors and not believable at all.There was no need to add Gilbert Roland's character tothe story. It only dragged the story down.
4,Beautiful Story,Ordered this from Amazon and it was delivered very quickly. I was not aware of this story or the events of what happened before I watched the movie. But I was moved by it. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a movie that will hold your interest. It will make you feel good. The events are very interesting and told well in this film.
5,Get to learn about our Mother...,I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has children...it is a way great way to teach the children about our Mother...It really is a great movie for the whole family to watch.
2,Fatima Rewritten,"An incredibly sentimental 'account' of the Fatima apparitions of 1917, completely unhindered by any of the true facts, and presented in the rose-hued glow of a Hollywood studio. Ironically one of the best things about the film is the addition of a totally fictitious 'loveable rogue' (Gilbert Roland)and his donkey - so that should give a clue as to the quality of the rest of it. Still, the film is entertaining, and the depiction of the Miracle of the Sun is done well. If you want the definitive dramatised film on Fatima, seek out ""Apparitions at Fatima"", made by Daniel Costelle in the late 90's and available on video - it was actually filmed at the Cova da Iria with a wonderful largely amateur Portuguese cast. Accurate, very moving, and photographically ravishing. Costelle's film received both Papal approval, and that of Sr. Lucia, the surviving seer of Fatima - recommendations don't come higher than that!"
3,The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima,"This movie is OK, But if I had watched it before I orderd it I would not have purchased it. The actor's are great and the story line is something I beleivereally happened. But I feel it should have been done in black and white. That'sjust my opinion, but judge for yourself."
4,Get your dance on.,"I normally wouldn't spend much on a collection like this, but I found it cheap, and have ended up really liking it. Truth be known, I think this is the best disc I've seen, as far as quantity and quality of songs goes. If you're into the techno/pop genre, this should definitely be your soundtrack. I pretty much like it all, but I really like the tracks from ""Olive"", ""BT"", ""Soul II Soul"", and ""Everything But The Girl"". Plus who hasn't cut-a-rug to ""Information Society"", ""EMF"", or ""Ace Of Base"" at one time or another? Some of these songs are obviously dated at this point, but that's part of the appeal. Everybody knows them. Overall, much like the ""Millennium hip-hop party"" disc, this is supposed to simply be alot of fun, and it is."
2,Disappointing,"I really loved The Fall of a Sparrow and greatly looked forward to another beautiful novel by the same author. Unfortunately this one fell apart about halfway through. Unlike the characters in The Fall of a Sparrow, too many of the characters in this book didn't sound or feel like real people, especially the grown-up Cory. The girl who painted an obscenity on the Appleton water tower was an intriguing character of few words seen mostly through the adoring eyes of the book's narrator: the grown-up woman just never took life on the page, despite the many long conversations in which she took part. The story of an American white boy's attraction to a black girl and his (surely realated) lifelong devotion to black music could have been a fascinating and far-reaching one: unfortunately this time the author fails to bring any satisfying insight to the subject."
2,Disapppointing,"I was happy to find this book, having enjoyed Sixteen Pleasures. That novel was interesting and clever nad the premise was compelling. Unfortunately Blues Lessons seems very dull, and not just in comparison. I found the characters unbelievable and unsympathetic. The protagonist was boring and the way he chose to live his life quite unlikely. The love of his life was more interesting but the book provided little insight into her motivations for denying that love and for keeping her daughter from having a family. The daughter seemed incredibly incurious about her father and was not at all a believable teenager. The purported exploration into race relations was nonexistent. Overall the book was a great disappointment and tedious to get through."
3,"Great disc, if edits are your thing","The titles on this disc reads like a who's who of classic rock. The recorded length of each song is not indicated for a reason, most of these tracks have been sliced up, which is not surprising from Rhino. ""Dream Weaver"" is cut down 45 seconds, gone is the instrumental intro and the edit goes directly to vocal. The harshest cut of all is ""In A Gadda Da Vida;"" once an eight minute heavy metal opus sliced to a two minute highlight. The stars given are for lineup and mastering. I want a little more bang for my buck so from this point on I'm swearing off Rhino various artists compilations including the 70's Have A Nice Day.... series because of the annoying edits."
1,Wow,"Wow, my friend picked up this album (he was misled into buying it by Bestbuy employee) and he was so dissapointed in it that he ended up breaking the CD. I listened to it and I have to say that ""KJ"" has no place in the world. His voice and flow are an Eminem knock off and the beats are also Eminem knock offs. Or actually cast aways because a real rapper wouldn't even want to be heard over this crap. Him trying to dis Eminem in anyway is ridiculous considering that KJ is trying to be Eminem. Either way don't bother to spend the money on this because if you do will end up completly dissapointed"
5,I laughed and was ministered to throughout the cd!!!!!,"This Cd regardless of any review that speaks negative it is in my opinion a step up from other music out there that does not glorify Jesus. Yes there r 1 or 2 songs that I was not really feeling but all in all this cd made me crack up with Fivetweezy, Rock With It, Plain White Rapper and For The Ladies. Plus several others that really ministered to me.You can hear longer snippets of his songs by going to his webpage that is kj52 . com. Wonderful for youth fans that need godly fresh hip hop. If you love hip hop and Christ I don't think that you will be disappointed with this Cd. Truly for all ages. A must get!!"
5,"KJ-52 does that 'rappy rap stuff' (His words, not mine.)","I wasn't a rap type person at all, so I requested that our library purchase this so I could check it out first. Well, they bought it, I listened to it, and loved it so much that I bought my own copy. The cool thing is now other people at the library can check it out, too.I love how he brings Christ's message to this type of music, proving that worship doesn't have to be any particular type of music. Spreading the truth is what really matters : )I loved the story of his life! It just shows how any situation can be turned around at any age. Love it, love it, love it!!!"
1,El hipócrita habla,"Me preocupan que alguien vendería un libro, negociando en su servicio como iniciado del gobierno con el acceso a la inteligencia más valiosa de nuestra nación, para beneficiarse del sufrimiento que esta nación aguantó de septiembre el 11 de 2001."
1,"El que come canta, loco se levanta",Me da mucho susto que un senador que debe servir a los Estados Unidos va a ganar una gran cantidad de dinero a causa de imprimiendo este libro. Esos tipos republicanos no tienen ningun idea de verguenza.
1,The one star shines very dimmly,"I'd have to say that I was extremely disappointed in this book. Because of the limited number of titles available dealing with estate planning, I had high hopes when I purchased this book. Unfortunately, it addressed the subject in a less than adequate manner, focusing on rather unimportant aspects of estate planning. In short, my money could have better been spent elsewhere."
3,Lipton Chamomile Tea,"Lipton makes some really good teas, but this is not one of them. the chamomile is masked by too many other flavors that mask the taste of the chamomile."
1,The Killer Tea,"This is a killer product for anyone on blood thinners. Any product with Chamomile can cause brain hemmorage, yet there is no warning on the Lipton Tea box -- check out Google for ""Chamomile"" and the warning sites are everywhere. I just wonder how many people have died and the coroner has had no idea of their cause of brain bleeding.I have notified the FDA and my Congress persons, and no one gives a crap."
2,"OH, HITCH!","This is absolutely the worst Hitchcock film ever. There are some great visuals and the Dali scenes are superb, but the script and the acting are just embarassing. I know that those were more naive times and that psychotherapy was kind of new to them, but really! How could anyone think that any psychoanalyst would act that way? I was just embarassed for everyone involved."
1,selznick/hitchcock = yuck,"all through the 40's hitchcock teamed up with mr. david o. selznick who, while making him well-known in the US, also managed to have him make horrible movies. his worst movies came out during this period. unfortunately this is one of them, and it's very terrible. extremely talky, ridiculous, boring, and it goes nowhere. the only thing of note is that salvador dali designed a dream sequence in the movie which, while it's not amazing or groundbreaking, is still interesting (think 5000 fingers of dr. t). not even worth a watch"
4,Hitchcockian Fun!,"This absorbing thriller for the mind is moody, romantic, mysterious and atmospheric. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman is great as the Psychiatrist who is looking for a way into Gregory Peck's mind. Peck's coldness actually makes him perfect for the part. Michael Chekhov is also great as Dr. Alex Brulov. Excellent score, and the 'gun camera' sequence are highlights. The dream sequence is definitely a standout, it is filled with cubist imagery and is simply masterful. Filled with the ""Master's"" usual tricks, Hitchcock managed to create another unique movie. Extras: Hitchcok's usual cameo, this time getting out of an elevator. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
1,Great movie...If I could see it,"It is a great movie, I know, but not from seeing it on this DVD. Would not load on one player. Next one I tried I had to load it 3 or 4 times before it would even come up on the screen. Then when you get it going, finially , don't mess with the menus because they are messed up. You would go to one thing and get another. I think I just got a defective DVD, but I can't do any thing about it, unless I buy another one or sell someone a defective DVD. So I am stuck with a lemon."
5,Spellbound is spellbinding,"Not the greatest Hitchcock film, but ironically it has four of Hitchcock's greatest sequences, all of them mind benders as befits a crime story about headshrinkers gone rotten. The famous Salvador Dali dream sequence is everything it has become famous for, a spectacularly subtle and understated seduction sequence - itself almost a dream - and the famous single frame ""red flash"" at the climactic confrontation. The film is in black and white yet Hitchcock and Selznick induced the company to insert a single or pair of red frames at humongous expense in a subliminal bit that freaked the audiences. This is called power in Hollywood. For the next 40 years nobody restored the red flash - until Turner and Criterion did the disk - too ridiculously expensive for B&w; prints and VHS.And the score - fabulous! One of the best which makes four great reasons to see the film."
3,Movies,I got this movie for my mom because she really loves it and loves getting old movies that she hasn't seen in a while.
1,DVD doesn't load,"Like another reviewer, I am not able to load the DVD on my Toshiba SD-1200 player. I own quite a few DVD's and have watched a lot of rentals and have not had any problems like this before now. I'm quite disappointed as I'm both a fan of Hitchcock and Criterion.Note: I contacted Criterion about this after submitting my review. They acknowledged a faulty pressing of the DVD and will reissue the DVD around the first week of November. You can also exchange your DVD with Criterion directly through the mail. Check out their website... for contact information."
3,Spellbinding?,"This is not one of Hitchcock's better films for sure. He does score a fine cast however, headed by Ingrid Bergman and an up-and-coming Gregory Peck. Ironically they were not Hitch's first choice but were foisted upon him by director David O. Selznick. The fabled Dali ""dream sequence"" is rather blah. It would have been nice to see it done in color in contrast to the rest of the film. The sequence is broken several times flashing back to Peck's recollection and Bergman's reaction. It hurts the continuity of the creative idea. In addition the movie really hasn't aged well. The film is saved somewhat because the theme is interesting and the love story feels legit. And of course there is no denying Hitchcock's mastery of lighting and photography. An interesting supporting cast as well with good old Leo G. Carroll and a first time appearance by beautiful Rhonda Fleming."
5,PURE HITCHCOCK !!!!,"I didnt know what to expect from this film , after all it was made in the 40's and how good could it be? WOW! This movie is so great it simply amazed me! Twist and turns and plots and sub=plots and suspense and....I have to say ""I Loved It!"" This is what you expect but dont always get from Hitchcock."
3,"Spellbound won't leave you spellbound, but it's fun even so","Spellbound is an amusing yet unmistakeably Hitchcock movie with many flaws. This is certainly not on the top-10 Hitchcock list as some reviewers have claimed, and its utterly dated subject matter is laughable, but it is fun to watch nevertheless (if just to make fun of it). The scene when Bergman and Peck are skiing down the hill is hilarious because it is clear that the images of Bergman and Peck were simply cut-and-pasted right over the picture of a ski hill. But the movie is fun, and the ending is not bad. Rent it, but don't buy the DVD. At least, not yet. I hear the Criterion version is going to be released (with the red frame!) sooner or later."
3,And here we go again...,"Kenny, even before The Killer's Hot Fuss, there was The Mission UK. Any album. In fact there was any 80's Post Punk and Alt Rock. Geez, people should get their facts right.That said, ""The Black Magic Show"" is another Post Punk revival album by another Post Punk Revival band, which in my opinion knows how to grab from many sounds but lacks creativity. There's a certain Stone Roses and Kitchens Of Distinction(without all the guitar noise, I must state) feeling, but in overall there's nothing new here. It's a nice listen, but nothing more..."
3,Heard this before,"I enjoy this CD, but let's face it: haven't we heard this before?It was called HOT FUSS by the Killers."
1,Backyard fight club,"Do not buy this DVD!!! I can put it no more plainly than that. This DVD gives you no more experience of fights than sitting in a high school parking lot watching people say ""Hit me!"" over and over again. There were literally disputes on this video that did not even end with a single punch being thrown. Absolute waste of my money."
2,Cute but darker than depicted and too tight,"When I received these, I noticed that the sneakers seemed quite a bit darker than depicted on the website. They also run a bit small. I should have ordered a half size higher. There was also a loose thread on the pair I received. They looked cute, but just did not work out for me."
5,The book is a must have for true D&D players!,"This source book is one of the most needed books in the AD&D game line! It has info on almost any creature you can think of and many, many more! The price they're selling it at in unbelievable!"
4,An Excellent Sourcebook for any mythology enthusiast,"Though not a D&D player, I browsed through a friend's copy of this book and was enthralled. As a mythology enthusiast and a fan of mythical monsters from all over the world, this book captured my imagination. Excellently illustrated by a number of talented artists, the book gives descriptions both in D&D numerical terms and layman's descriptions. Anyone looking for an end-all/be-all of mythological knowledge should be warned, however, that this tome does alter certain aspect of the mythical monsters for purposes of the game, and some of the creatures presented herein are entirely created by TSR. An interesting read and a great source of information. Enjoy!"
5,Might I remind the Younger players...,"Players and DM's alike, I have been playing role playing games since Tunnels and Trolls came out in the 70's. I used the 3-ring binder for years and the bottom line is that TSR needed a hardcover, bound Monster Book in order to promote the game they developed and sell. How many times would you need to re-issue the 3-ring sheets containing the dragons and the orcs...come on..this book puts all the basics in one book so you can build on it. The annuals come out and if i am not mistaken you can still buy three ring binders and place all the ghouls you want from the boxed sets in there...However i would not think of playing without this book eventhough i can rattle off creatures stats by heart...it is a playing must and well worth the money!"
4,A good book for AD&D players.,This book is terrific for anyone who has ever played AD&D 2nd edition. The only problem is that it does not contain all the information that might be useful- attributes and stuff.
5,Some of the BEST art and info I have EVER seen! DM's wannit!,"Amazing. That is ALL there is to say, except DM's (dungeon masters) shouldn't play a game without it!"
3,There are Advantages and Disadvantages,The Monstous manual is a well organized book to get a monster if you need it in a hurry...but the prepared DM would prefer the 3 Ring binder of the old with monstrous compendium annuals in it...
4,Exellent Illustrations,This is a very good book for making up adventures. It also is very good just to look at and research different monsters. It has some of the best pictures I have ever seen
5,An essential for any ad&d DM,"This book is one of the three books that are essential to running a game of AD&D2e(Players' Handbook, Monstrous Manual). It concisely describes all the elements involved in running a fun, exciting campaign for everyone involved. It is also commendable in that it tells you often that the rules outlined are merely guidelines- nay, suggestions, and it encourages you to make your own rules.One thing I would have liked would be some more actual examples of gameplay, as this would help new DMs to get the feel of the game quickly. But these can be found elsewhere to those who care to look.Overall, a very useful book. An indispensible resource to any DM."
4,It's basically has all you need to know!,"This Montrous Manual has a good deal of monsters/races though it lacks in gods and goddesses. It is very confusing if you don't know what you're doing but it gets easier... way easier. And if your a fan of beholders and beholder-kin (like myself) this has 18 different types of them (not each and it only reviews 12 gives summariesof the last 6). Although it has the monsters it doesn't tell the treasure which I found kind of annoying at first.Actually I don't HAVE the book, my grandpa does, but I'm highly considering buying this masterpiece of a monster manuel. Mostly because of the art, exact computation of the experience given and magic listed (and special abilities) and much more for each of the many and wonderfully exciting creatures that await it's creator to make and use at his/her glee. Heh...Heh...Heh..."
1,Disappointed...........,"Excellent price and free s/h; but the package arrived in extremely poor condition~~ 4 weeks after placing the order. I requested a return without even opening it. As this is not typical of Amazon.com, as well as returns are so easy, I really don't have much to complain about. Maybe Amazon should reconsider selling this item."
1,Ordered July 2004...still not received as of November!!!,"This is a follow-up to my previous review which I submitted on September 15, 2004. Yesterday I received yet another notice from Amazon that my order for this item was (yet again!) delayed. Now the revised ""estimated"" delivery date is December 9th-December 29th!!?? I ordered this bench July 21st, figuring if I ordered it in July I'd get it by Labor Day. Now it looks like I really will get it for Labor Day...of 2005...if I'm lucky. I will never again order any furniture item from Amazon. This is truly pathetic. If I didn't have my heart set, for going on six months now, on putting this hummingbird bench in my garden (which has hummingbirds in nice weather) I'd just cancel it and get something else. I'm extremely disappointed in Amazon'lack of service. It is a first in my experience with them."
5,Black colander,Have been looking for a black enameled colander for 3 years andfinally found one (actually 3 different sizes).
5,Legendary,"Seriously, this movie is legendary. Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan are great together, the side characters are all really funny, Hema Malini is so gorgeous I had to bite my thumb every time she was onscreen, and of course Gabbar Singh is a great villain. Just one of the best/most entertaining films I've ever seen, a must-watch."
5,"Good Western, Eastern Style","Unlike some others who reviewed, I'm going to review the product in this product review, rather than the seller, which is another rating page (hint to those who reviewed the seller).This movie is very good. It has all the elements of an Indian movie which make it distinct from American style movies, but it also has the elements of a typical Western film without seeming out of place. The music is wonderful. It has great humour, drama, action and romance.It, like all Indian movies, is long and has a rather multi-faceted plot and mixes almost every cinematic element possible, but in the end it is a well made movie."
4,Great Purchae,"It's always a privilege to purchase over your prestigious store , and with each DVD you prove how much your service is unique and fast and reliable , and this is why I always come back looking for more deals and don't buy from any where else ."
3,"Needs a proper restoration....Criterion, anyone?","I tried to watch this DVD, and I had to stop. First, this film was shot in 70mm, and the DVD is pan and scan. Not good. Second, the songs weren't subtitled! Not good. And, thirdly, there are so many versions out there. How long was the actual film? 204 minutes? 280? Most people who have seen the entire thing have said it's magnificent. It's regarded as one of the greatest Bollywood films ever made, and we should be able to see it in all its uncut, widescreen, subtitled glory. Criterion should release something like this. They have never done a Bollywood film, and this is an important one, so it fits, excuse the pun, their criterion."
3,Yeah Okay,"I am a big Ian Rankin fan and won't catch a plane without him. I love reading about the seedier side of Edinburgh. However I am finding his first two books a little more difficult, they seem to be an attempt at literary journals rather than an airport novels. The characters in Ian's books, over the years, have become my friends and through reading 'Hide and Seek' I enjoyed finding out how many of them met each other."
4,Rebus at His Best,"Rankin delivers here just as he always does. Again, I judge the earlier Rebus books to be the best in the series."
4,"Solid, above average maybe too fast-paced at the end","This is a very good book. Ian Rankin writes about his character Inspector Rebus in such a readable way, the pages just pass by while we read the life of Rebus.I think that Rankin's one weakness is the ending of his books (this may relate to his earlier books more than the later ones) in that they seem awfully rushed and a little fanciful. Once the obligatory action scenes have died down, Rankin reverts to his true form of quality writing."
4,"Interesting story, hard to put down","Rankin was a suggested author for me as a Michael Connelly fan. Hide and Seek was my first of his books to try. I liked John Rebus right away. The setting is Scotland, so that was different and some of the words were most definitely European. I am going to check out more books in the Rebus series."
4,Hide & Seek -my thoughts,This is the first Ian Rankin biik I have read and I choose it because my English class all had to choose a Scottish text to read and review...so I thought I'd give it ago. I thought the book was extremly well written and described and I could imagine how each of the charcters were acting. I could hardly put the book down because I was wanting to read on and how it all ended...This is a must read book if u like a simple but extremly effective murder mystery.....
1,Government Recall!!!,Please note that as of August 2008 this Haba toy has been recalled due to choking hazards. See the following link for more information:http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml08/08380.htmlIt's a shame-- I love Haba toys. Hopefully they will correct the problem and release a better model.
5,manual single plug control from the front,"I go this for my cable based home networks since you need to power up the modem, then the router, then the VoIP, etc in order and plugging and unpluging from the back of each device is messy and clumsy."
5,Damn. Now I have to buy all the expanded editions....,"...and retire all of my original editions. The remastering brings out much richer tones in the guitars, clearer vocals, and more driving bottom end. It doesn't change the fact that you're listening to the Ramones (there's no sense of studio fakery), but it does show you that the earlier limitations of the technology (and of the Ramones' budgets) really did a disservice to the music. The remastering is amazing, for example, the song Pinhead always had a very muffled tone, as if it were performed in a padded cell. It was always a great song, but with the remastering it literally explodes out of the speakers. What it really proves is that the Ramones were even better than we thought. Assuming that the other expanded editions are this good, then all my old discs are on their way to the ""Used"" bin at my local music store."
5,Yes Please!,"Just another one of the great albums by the Ramones. You can definitely hear the evolution of their music and I don't care who you are...you can't help but rock out to the Ramones. When I'm listening to the Ramones, I am happy. What's also great about this edition is the bonus live tracks...it's like having two CDs in one!"
2,reproduced,"This disc does not sound like the original record. It sounds slicker and prettier. It does not sound like the recording that shook the foundations of rock and roll. It hasn't been ""remastered""; it has been ""reproduced"". As such, most of its original vision and power is lost.A shame because I've waited for years for the first four Ramones albums to come out on CD with their original artwork. This has the original artwork, but not the original sound."
5,Ramones Greatness Didn't...Leave Home!,"I gotta tell you, this album is great! My favorites include ""Glad To See You Go"", ""Oh Oh I Love Her So"", ""Carbona Not Glue"", ""Suzy Is A Headbanger"", ""Pinhead"", ""Swallow My Pride"", ""California Sun"", ""Commando"" & ""Babysitter"". The bonus show is great too. If you ever had the chance to see the Ramones live, you would never forget it. Gabba Gabba Hey!"
5,THE BEST RAMONES ALBUM EVER!,"I have been a Ramones fan since day 1 and I have every thing they've ever recorded (even in bootleg form). This is BY FAR the best whole album they ever did. There are several Ramones classic that aren't here, but song for song this is definitely their best. Glad to See You Go kicks off things right and the cover of California Sun is excellent. If you aren't familliar with the Ramones this is the CD to start with. If you don't like this one, I doubt you'll like any of the others. This is punk rock at its best."
5,Eat a Kosher Salami and Buy This Album!,"This one gets my vote for best Ramones record. Why? It's the perfect mixture of romance and kick-out-the-jams energy that made them such a beloved band. Better songwriting than the first album, but grittier and wilder than the later stuff. Actually, any true rock-and-roll fan should own the first four Ramones releases, but if you're heading to a desert island and can choose only one... PLUS you get the bonus live material and ""Carbona, Not Glue!"" LEAVE HOME is so much fun, it should be criminal!"
4,Punks Leave Home,"As the liner notes explain, The Ramones had written over 30 songs before they got signed to Sire Records in 1976. This CD gives us most of those 30 songs. The Ramones are hardly the best punk group. They never quite out-grew their punk rock, garage band roots. This album, however, finds them early on when they were still red hot and before their music became monotonous. This CD benefits greatly by its bonus material, sixteen songs recorded live at the Roxy in 1976. These bonus tracks mean you get almost the entire first album along with the second -- a very good deal, considering that the live versions are just as good if not better than the studio versions."
1,Almost useless,"The author takes the old D'Alembert system (he doesn't even spell it right)and lists various bet choices in casino games where you can try it. What's remarkable is that he recommends NOT trying many of the variations he suggests in the book. He then goes on to admit that this system, which has been proven over and over to fail (like any other progression), actually doesn't work in a real casino, and then tries to blame casino cheating! That, combined with his religious rantings that have nothing whatever to do with the subject at hand, lead me to seriously question this guy's grip on reality. In fact, one wonders why someone who is so worried about Satan and evil is encouraging gambling in the first place. His ""Mathematical Analysis"" sections contain neither math nor analysis. Send me your money instead and I'll recommend much, much better books."
4,Enjoyable & Inspiring,"The ""story"" was very good & would definitely recommend the read. The consistent misspelling was atrocious,& sentence form poor at times. Realizing this was either a .99 or free book (don't remember now), however, allowed me to look beyond & enjoy the novel itself. Very much liked it."
3,"Good, but a little too long","I generally love this author and I love the story, but the story went way longer than it should have."
4,The Spirit of St. Louis - Finally on DVD!,"I've waited a very long time for this DVD release, and even though it wasn't the box office hit that Warner was expecting, it's still an entertaining and inspiring account of Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight.The video transfer is good quality, which shows much more detail, especially in the darker (read nighttime) scenes. The widescreen is a Godsend for those of us who were annoyed with the VHS version's constant panning, and the audio is greatly improved. My only regret is that I am spoiled by modern movie's huge array of special features, of which there are very few. Some archieval footage or perhaps technical data about the actual flight might have been nice. But that stuff's available online. I recommend this release."
4,I have the impression that the original film of my youth was longer at the end,"Nice review of a time when achievement, merit, hard effort and creativity, were the values to imitate and follow ,not the same of today unfortunately."
3,Movie follows Lindbergh's own book...,"I see a lot of comments in the reviews about Wilder's use of flashbacks. Well, it's been years since I saw the movie, but I just read Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize winning account of the flight, and I couldn't help visualizing Jimmy Stewart as Lindy. Wilder seems to have been trying to remain true to the literary work as well as the heroic achievement. I can't speak to details, but now I really want to see this film again."
2,Disappointing,"I typically love Jimmy Stewart movies. I think he was such a talented actor and had many good roles througout his career. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. This movie is extremely boring. I stuck with it too the end, just hoping that it would get better, but it did not. It was very long and laborous! I am glad that I did not purchase this one, but, instead, just watched it on cable."
4,The Spirit of Jimmy Stewart,I remember watching this movie as a young kid growing up in the sixties and this movie always has stuck out for me. Why??..well sure it doesn't have the loud explosive special effects of today and some might seem to be bored by the movie. If your like this then this isn't the movie for you. But for me and I'm sure others a real charming and simple movie to watch..especially with Jimmy Stewart in the title role. Back in '27 this was like landing on the moon in '69 for a later generation but to simply fly solo across the Atlantic was huge news back then. For the airplane had only been around for the past twenty years or so until a handful of flyers attempted the crossing..with some dying or never to be heard from again.
3,The Spirit of St. Louis (1957),"I saw this movie first run when I was 9 years old (1957), and I have always remembered it. By today's standards it is probably boring. But this movie was made shortly after the end of the McCarthyism era in America (1950-1954), where movies weren't supposed to portray anything bad about the United States (the Hollywood blacklist era). It's basically a one man movie with James Stewart portraying Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic through flashbacks of his early career in aviation which lead up to his historic flight. His trials and tribulations getting the plane built; finding financing, finding somebody to build the plane, the self doubt. James Stewart is perfect for the roll with his sense of dry hummer. Directed and screen play by Billy Wilder."
4,Epic Flight,"If you are a James Stewart fan or have an interest in Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic journey, this is a must see. Billy Wilder and the others involved in this 1957 production took an inherently monotonous story (over thirty three hours flying solo in a light plane) and made it into an exciting film. Wilder broke up the monotony with flashbacks about Lindbergh's life in aviation. Some of these flashbacks are a bit tedious.Wilder apparently remained faithful to Lindbergh's own account of the journey. (I hope to read this book someday.) The film built enough suspense to have me cheering Stewart on at the end. I felt overwhelmed when the plane touched down in Paris."
4,The Spirit of ST Louis,"Faithfull story of the book written by C.A. Lindbergh. Some jokes have been added that were not in the book, but without spoiling the story."
2,Stuck in the hangar,"Jack Warner confessed that he was startled when this movie flopped at the box office. Two talents as huge as James Stewart and Billy Wilder should have been proof against that. But as the Amazon review suggests, when he made this movie James Stewart was literally twice as old as Lindbergh was at the time of his flight, and completely misses the youthful exuberance and daring that fueled the project in the first place. Viewers would be far better off reading Lindbergh's memoir of the same title, a book which cries out for a movie remake."
2,A bad one,"This is one of the worst. ""What's in the box"" is terrible. You can laugh at the end. ""The Mirror"" is terrible, it's their impression on Castro, ""What you Need"" is good. And ""The Old Man in the cave"" is good. This one has two bad ones and two good ones. Which ones do you like better? Take your pick....."
3,very nice and white,"look great, starting to get a little beat up after 6 mos of steady washing, and wearing. never like the tag on the back -- always been a scratchy pain for me back there."
3,Rich but disappointing,"Ali's book contains much vivid detail, but while the flow of his discourse is vividly literary, his sentences somehow fail to explain clearly. Many passages left me scratching my head. He does succeeded in nicely deconstructing Middle Eastern and Western fundamentalisms, but it would have been nice to see more constructed in its wake. Somewhat overwhelming in its detail, and not as focused as I would have liked."
5,Read if you talk US policy or the Muslim world!,"Someone once said ""thinking is the hardest work there is -- which is why so few people do it."" This book can be annoying and one can argue with the ideas, but it deserves applause because it makes you think! I value it far more than Huntington's work on the clash of civilizations -- if you read that you owe it to yourself to read this too! If you agree with everything in a book you problem wasted your time reading it and learned next to nothing. The cover with George Bush's ""unauthorized"" picture is alone worth the price. Far too much of what is said herein is likely to be true for the comfort of those who are happy with the pablum from the domestic Press. I wish Charlie Rose and others would just once in awhile invite such guests!"
4,For admirerers of San Antonio and also of Gerard Barray,"I read San-Antonios since I was 15, and i am glad to see Gerard Barray( a great actor), featuring San-A. I am sorry though that other movies with Gerard Barray are not for sale at Amazon, because I am sure that people in their fifties , from europe, saw him in many good adventure movies impossible to find naw.For instance the Pardaillan series, and the series with action in south-america.Again, I recomend this movie, and also J ai peur des mouches, the other San-A movie."
3,Gallant Bride,This story is one filled with tragedy. I could hardly bare to stand reading a book filled with such heartache. Malcolm had gone from a courageous and intelligent young man in Yankee Bride/Rebel Bride to a sensless and withering gambler. My heart ached for young Blythe. I hoped that she would gain some common sense. Time warp.
4,It is an almost acceptable copy of the original game,"It is a good game, it has good graphs and colors, but it lacks landscapes almost and it does not have variety of tracks that one can choose. But it has all icons of the original game and new aggregates, it has a descent and good handling of car in the game, I talk about to that on handles the controls well. The effect of the rumble pack is very good. Only the bad thing is that one can't run over and carve up real people and see much red blood by all sides and aslo to see parts of human bodies leave the screen throughout. But it is a good game in any case."
2,incomplete directions and materials lists,"This book does not compare to Ginger Summit's previous books on gourd crafts. The material lists are incomplete and the instructions are poorly written. It was extremely frustrating, particularly to construct the thumb piano, to have incomplete parts list and the book assumes that the user has a fairly extensive knowledge of tools. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone who wants a quality folk type instrument. I have constructed four instruments and found the general directions poor. It was interesting from a historical folk instrument aspect but was not functional for helping one learn to create gourd instruments."
4,Gourd Music,"This book is amazing. I've already made the kazoos. There's a few that I'd like a bit more detail in the instructions, but overall it's an interesting and useful book about Gourd Musical Instruments."
3,It's OK.,Instructions are OK if you have fabrication skills. Do not expect exact step by step directions. Some good ideas though.
2,Good picture but doesn't stand the test of time.,"When new the image is great on these. The bulbs last 2-3 years if you get a quality phillips bulb, off brands are junk. But after a few years all these LCD projection type TV's, including Sony SXRD, JVC HDILA etc. have optical block issues which starts as yellow or greenish tint spots and slowly spreads to the entire image. The only fix is to replace the optical block unit which is more expensive than a new 60"" TV."
3,"Lots of good info, but poor photographs","Maybe it was just my copy of the book but the images are not very good (fuzzy and flat) and do not reinforce the text.One particular example stands out. The author talks about removing clutter in a photograph. However, the example is so cluttered and flat, it is difficult to determine what the subject is supposed to be. The text goes on to say ""...notice how the flower stands out from the busy background..."" . Actually, no, I don't!There are many thought provoking exercises. And maybe the quality of the photos causes you to look at them a little closer than you normally might be inclined to.It isn't a bad book. With a little more attention to the images, it could be a GREAT book."
1,Pass up this one.,Very poor presentation with poorly printed BW images and composition is not fully explored. There are much better books on photographic composition. Skip this one.
2,"Lot of fill, lack of articulation, not the deep-dive you'd expect","This was a painful read and I'm minimally better for it.The author breaks the book into several 1-3 page chapters about variousshapes and objects - the goal here being to teach you how to ""see"" eachobject. The concept is unique, but unfortunately the author starts eachchapter with 3 or 4 paragraphs of absolutely irrelevant, useless historyof each shape or object. It was a waste of ink and space that couldotherwise been used for more (and much better) illustrations. Furthermoreif the author had any geometrical or scientific basis for his lessons, itfailed to show through in the book."
4,Seems to work well in my 4 cyl.,Thicker then many of the other products and stickier than any other product I have seen like Lucas. This product seems to work well when STP Oil additive did nothing.
2,cancion editada,"Todo estaba bien en esta edicion digipack, pero al llegar a la cancion ""sin tu carino"" se escucha una version cortada al comienzo, al medio y al final."
5,a great book!,"Spring Moon is a novel about the historical,political,and changes in family. This novel documents the five generations of loss, turmoil, and happieness for one woman names Spring Moon. This is an excellent nolve and i highly reccomend reading it."
3,Camo Canon Armor,This item does not fit the Mark II series. I felt like the armor that I received looks much less camoish and much more cheap and goony. I won't complain too much tho because I'm only out of like 15 dollars.
2,not too useful,"MADE CA-1113-BLK SLR Camera Armor for Canon 5D Digital SLR (Black)It may be a reasonable protection from direct hit or drop, but the material it's made from collects way too many dust particals and debris on its surface, in addition it slowes down operation of the camera by adding additional leyer to the controls."
2,static dust collection,"the cover fit nicely but seems to collect static dust and small hairs all over the rubber which made me a bit skeptical as to how good it is in the longrun as the digital sensors have a hard time when dust gets on the sensor, creating more work in the long run to keep it clean. I prefer to avoid the dust and hairs on the body exterior as much as possible and once they are on there the static charge makes them difficult to get off. Dont know if I will even use this now. but if you are in extreme weather conditions than the casing itself would provide some good , extra protection."
5,Great Product,Bought this item for my 5d Mark II. Excellent build quality and fit! I really like Camouflage so the color was definitely a plus. The item was on my doorstep in 2 days which was much faster than expected! I recommend this product for other 5d Canon owners.
3,VHS technology on DVD,"A very good movie -- too bad that this region 1 DVD (released July 1,2008) is exactly the same thing as the previously available VHS tape:white English subtitles (non-removable) are printed over the videoframe (often impossible to read when it is white on white).The soundtrack is original French.There are no other options or features on this DVD."
4,Love and the Art of Throwing Knives,"This mesmerizing movie, lavishly filmed in black and white, provides a brand new twist on what it means to throw yourself off a bridge. Vanessa Paradis and Daniel Auteuil give fine performances in this quixotic tale of love and the art of throwing knives. Auteuil plays a knife-thrower who finds his assistances in the most unlikely of places. In this case, ""the girl on the bridge."" He and Paradis form an intimate bond, taking Auteuil's character to new heights in the circus in which he performs. The tension mounts as the knife throwing becomes increasingly more passionate. Paradis is a sensual delight to watch. It is a very pleasurable, if not deeply satisfying film, which takes you to the edge of climax."
5,Offbeat and Fun!,"This is not a deep piece of cinema, by any stretch. But it will do for pure esacpism. So the plot's kinda thin, the characters and the director don't take themselves the least bit seriously. It's all about Kismet, hooking up with the right or wrong person, then riding it out.Luck seems to pursue these star crossed lovers like some kind of Greek Fury. She's the ""in bed with each new man (or facsimile therof) who looks at her twice. He's the intredpid pessimist French Guy held over from 50's and 60's French Cinema. Lots of references to Truffaut and Goddard in the characterisation, which I lapped up and thought way amusing.Give this film a glance at least. The subtitles pretty much match what's occuring on screen with a few risible exceptions.BEK"
3,Obscure French Film is Creative but not very Entertaining.,"This black and white modern French film is very much in the New Wave style with grainy images, lack of glamour, and shaky camera shots. It tells the story of a knive thrower who finds a young girl on a bridge who wants to kill herself. He eventually befriends her and takes her to Monaco to be his target in a the knife throwing competitions. The two of them become erotically attached to the thrill of danger and take many risks.It was a creative idea and the sequences when the girl is being a target for the knives are riveting, but the film just left me dry. This is strange because I normally love French films."
4,Runs like a long Calvin Klein fragrance commercial,"This movie is a piece of eye candy disguised as an independent film. The plot is rather straightforward and the subtitles are pretty easy to follow. A great job for a cliched romance. The acting is very subtle. They all have haunted eyes. This is a great date movie for those who would like to relive Gone with the Wind, or at least get laid."
1,Boring,"Simply boring. Too long/slow. Maybe it is because it doesn't meet the American audience's expectations of what a movie should be like. I almost fell asleep. Too bad, I liked the actors."
5,State of the art,Any place the camera stops could make an unforgetable photograph.Close view on faces and well place silents speak more than any action.I strongly recommend you watch and live this movie.Philippe
4,Great Comeback Single,"Not only is the lead track outstanding,the b-sides are great as well. In fact, of the 4 tracks, ""It's Hard to Walk Tall, When You're Small"" may be the best of the bunch. ""Munich Air Disaster 1958"" is not far behind. This is Morrissey at his best lyrically since ""Vauxhall,"" and his voice sounds great as well.I was a bit skeptical when I heard Jerry Finn (see Blink and Green Day) was producing the album, but this is the richest, most developed single Morrissey has released as a solo artist. Can't wait for the full album."
4,"what else can I say, Morrissey rocks!","I was really happy to see several b-sides to the Irish Blood English Heart single - it's true, the Never-Played Symphonies is a wonderful song - really moving, with some of my favorite vocals by Moz - I was really satisfied with this - I got it on vinyl first and will probably get it on cd, even though I hadn't planned on it...but it was surprising strong, so it's worth the $ - Morrissey rocks!"
3,The bonus tracks outshine the single,"""Irish Blood"" is an odd first choice for a single off Morrissey's ""You Are the Quarry"". It rocks hard with a solid beat, but the lyrics aren't necessarily accessible. It's also very brief. ""Walk Tall"" is a tight, if proselytizing number(with amusing overtures to 'gringos'); ""Munich Air Disaster"" is in a chillier, narcotizing, death-as-an-ideal vein, and is thoughtful and incredible; ""The Never Played Symphonies"" is nearly as mournful, yet somehow blissful and lovely. In fact it's quite beautiful, and should've made the album."
4,Mozstrikesagain!,"Morrissey's always been one of the best singles artists, and this is just another example. Buy it for the A side, but the tribute to Manchester United on ""Munich Air Disaster, 1958"" is what draws me in on this one. Well done Mozzer. Never forgetting his team, or his roots."
5,"Not literally, but metaphorically...","I picked up Morrissey's new single yesterday after a long school day of anticipation, and I certainly was not disappointed. This is a great disc, with the fantastic 'Irish Blood English Heart' supported by three outstanding b-sides. I think the prize goes to 'The never-played symphonies,' though, which is not only the strongest of these four songs, but definitely one of Moz's best overall. Just beautiful."
4,Everything's good exept for the packaging,The quality of the guitar is great. My only complain is about the packaging. It was dented when it arrived at my friend's. That is probably why one of the knobs was not working properly. The trouble is I live in Poland and the guitar was sent to me by my friend - of course repacked. He didn't know that there was somethig wrong with it.It would take too much time and effort to send it back to States and wait for the outcome of all processes. Screw it! I have a guitar! Type 'Trans Emiter' in Youtube to see it being used in Poland!
5,excellent instrument,"Beautiful worksmanship, very clean sound, decent gig-bag. Plugged into a crate speaker and blackheart amp -- sounds very good across all settings (4 dials & dual seymour duncan pickups). Look on the Washburn site & Youtube -- almost all very favorable reviews. I got mine for high three hundreds, shipped and couldn't be happier"
2,Disorganized and poorly-presented,"I've posted a detailed review of the book at[...]. In summary, though, the book is disorganized and presented in an amateurish manner. There's some good information in there, but it's too scattered to be useful for a novice and too shallow for an expert. Not recommended."
2,Do not buy if you hope to learn,It has concepts yes but other than that it doesnt have much.It is not a book for those looking to learn the art.It does not contain flows or drills.
2,smokey,"Having studied filipino for 25 years, I didnt find the book very authentic or from a combat standpoint, which is what I look for. As with many books I found it to be a misintrepretation, maybe due to the bias of studying modern japanese budo and what not. I found it to be ignorant, twisted and like the entire modern public martial art community corrupt with non factual opinions. It may serve for breaking the ice on FMA but that is about it. Most 20 year martial artists have a biased view of the cummunity to begin with and its material like this that flames the fire of falsity"
4,good reading,this is a very good book that gives a glimpse of the fcs kali system founded by master ray dionaldo with a showcasing of techniques.nice!!
2,Tame..,"Of the two cds I have heard from Teddy Greaves, this one is better than the other. He covers some calypso songs by such noteable calypsonians as the Mighty Sparrow but this is music for the tourists rather than the natives. I could easily imagine Teddy Greaves and His Groovy Group playing a Las Vegas lounge on ""Pirate Night"". I just do not enjoy easy listening versions of songs which, in their original form, were full of power and passion. All that has herein been removed so as to be absolutely bland and non threatening. If tou are looking for good calypso, there are many other disks which are MUCH better."
1,"tis lost, lads.","its pointless to make a less than a 5 review post on this cd because people wil label it 'unhelpful', even if its as long + informative as stan smiths'.good job guys.im moving to the artic circle so get away from humanity."
2,Not Worth Buying,"Aside from two songs ( ""Helena"" & ""The Ghost of You"" ), this album is pure crap. This album is mostly littered with songs about death ( what else would you expect from an album with two people covered in blood on the cover ), and tends to grow tedious after the first couple of songs. The songs never really develop any emotion, which it tries to mask with Gerard's whiny voice.My Chemical Romance doesn't have that ""punk"" feel, which leads me to believe that the band is nothing more than a bunch of nerds in heavy make-up, singing about death in a desperate and pathetic charade to sound emo."
4,Why All the Hate?,"Just one thing before I get my mini-review going...""Like I always say to the brainwashed drones of MTV, ""MTV shouldnt tell you whats cool and what isnt. Be original and make your own choices like an intelligent human being. Be unique"" sheesh.""...but listening to you is just fine, right?My younger brother had a copy of the CD a while ago and I gave it a spin. I had heard some of the hype and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I knew I had to buy it. Right of the bat I thought the CD was solid, albeit a bit poppy in places. But then again, what's so bad about that?All in all, this is a great CD to crank up and rock out with. But nobody does that anymore, I guess..."
1,disgrace 2 rock and all music in genaral,"first of all i would like 2 say this is the worst disgrace 2 rock ever, this band is going 2 b responsible for rocks death rock is very quickly falling 2 ""emo"" which is awful. and this band is one of the key problems. no musical talent no talent at all this is the worst guitar playing i have heard in my life my little cousin could do this. the whole band is just flat out awful what ever happened 2 distorted guitar and wah wah effects?!?!?if u even remotly play ne instrament do not listen to this brain wash it is terrible. please check out these REAL bands. Nirvana,mudhoney,screaming trees,black flag,minor threat,jimi hendrix,black sabbath,blue cheer,melvins,soundgarden,alice in chains, alice cooper, dinosaur jr, sonic youth, the stooges, mc5, and much more like this please steer clear of this mcr musical damage"
1,"live revolves around me, fudge the rest of you","I wear black clothes, and have sex with dead bodies. I am the only person that's alive. my feelings are the only one's that matter. I use drugs and drink alcohol so people will think i'm cool. i watch mtv and am extremly rebellious. Look out world. When I'm not hanging out at hot topic or hating my family. I usually cook babies in the fryer at burger king and feed them to customers. sorry, i have to go apply more makeup so people will feel sorry for me."
2,My Chemical Romance gone stale,"This CD is catchy, but they lose most of their credibility on this album. It's mildly watered down and seemingly fabricated for radio airplay."
3,That oh-so-thin line between clever and stupid...,"Or what do you do with an album whose song titles are infinitely more wittier than the songs themselves? I'd vaguely heard good things about this band and after briefly looking over the play list, I figured, hey, this is great - a bunch of wiseass New Jersey punks smirking their way to fame and glory. I mean, how can you go wrong with a CD that has tunes like ""You Know What They Do To Guys Like Me In Prison"" or ""I Never Told You What I Did For A Living?""Well, gosh darn you My Chemical Romance. This isn't a bad album (filled with pretty much what Green Day was doing ten years ago) but unless I'm completely missing something, this really isn't an ironic, post-modern take on what it's like to grow up in a collection of dead-end, souless suburbs. This is only working on one level and no, ""Helena"" is not some surreal cover of the old Chet Baker song, as one might have been led to expect. Oh well - back to my old Dead Boys tapes..."
1,nope,"Even the supposed ""best song"" on this album, I'm Not Okay puts me to sleep. One star though since zero stars is not an option and because You know what they do to guys like us in Prison has a great beginning, but no use buying the album for just that one song, just get it off iTunes."
5,CLASSIC ALL THE WAY,"This album is outstanding. I am a big System of a Down fan, and usually can't put there stuff down. I have been an MCR fan for about six months. I just happened to hear I'm Not OK, and thought it was one of the best songs I ever heard. I don't listen to radio much, nor do I watch a bunch of music videos. But I have to say it impressed me enough to go buy this cd, and between this and the Black Parade, I am astonished. I literally have not listened to anything else, but maybe a few times since I started listening to them. Once you get hooked on one song long enough, you end up getting hooked on something else. There isn't a single bad song on this cd. The lyrics and the music, just go so great together. Do yourself a favor and join the parade, you won't regret it."
4,Entertaining,"I like how tough guys come on here and post how we should all listen to real ""punk"" bands like THE SEX PISTOLS or THE CLASH or DEAD KENNEDY'S!!!!! YEAAAAAH PUNK ROCK!!! or to REAL MUSIC like NIRVANA or METALLICA!!!Good job guys. There's probably some Green Day or Fall Out Boy albums for you to do that in also. Have fun."
2,Umm...,"Personally, I don't really care too much for My Chemical Romance, but I don't think they are the worst band ever. I am not and expert on instruments and how to play them, but the music sounds pretty good on this album. Gerard should work on his vocals though, I can't understand a word he says in a few of the songs. I think the two most notable tracks on here were ""Helena"" and ""Ghost of You."" They really did and outstanding job on these two songs. I really think this band has potential. Although they aren't all that great right now, I think with a little hard work, they could become something great."
2,Not like the first,"If you liked their first album, 'I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love', reconsider buying their second album. It isn't a bad album, but after 2 years their style has changed. It lacks the punch that the first one had, and it also has a more mainstream sound that a lot of bands have adopted. Perhaps their lyrics still have the same meanings, but even their single 'I'm Not Ok (I Promise)' sounds like a cross between a Christmas song and some pop-punk band. Overall, buy it if you are willing to accept their new style and seemingly new guitar style. If you were hardcore a My Chemical Romance supporter, be prepared to be dissapointed. I sure was."
4,"something loud, something different","I've never given MCR much though because the truth is I wasn't impressed at all by the songs from their earlier effort. I bought this CD because everyone was gushing abt it & was all hyped up about it. I've heard Helena, I'm Not Okay & Thank You for the venom from the MCR site & loved the video for the former 2. So wth, it's probabaly good.Hmmm, the thing is, the cd took quite a while for me to enjoy it in its entirety. Sometimes I'd just skip to the tracks (1,4,5,7,9) Some CDs just jump out at you & it'll be your all time faves from the start. For me, not this CD. It took me quite a while to listen to it properly & savour it.Now after listening to it for a while, I think it's started to grow on me. I have other favourites but I can see why this is an outstanding CD"
4,Awesome,"I love this CD, it is not hard to listen to at all, and they combine amazing guitar riffs with powerful vocals creating one of my favourite CDs at the moment. Every song is worth listening to if you like energy driven emo/punk i highly recommend it. best songs include 'you know what they do to guys like us in prison'-bert sings on this one so its twice as good, 'the ghost of you' 'to the end' and 'its not a fashion statement'"
2,After Hearing I Brought You My Bullets.....,".....this album did not impress me at all. In fact i am turned off by this album completely. I feel their first work is more talented and it overall sounds better then this album. Sure, there are definitely one or two bright spots. The first track (and 2nd single i believe) Helena is a great song. But it all goes downhill from here. The Ghost Of You (3rd single) is the only other decent song (terrible video though lol). The first single Im Not Okay (I Promise) is not a good song at all and gets annoying while listening to it. Thank You For My Venom has a great intro but.....well thats only the intro...the rest of the song is blah. If you want some good MCR, and some great Gerard Way (Lead Vocals) pick up I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love. The lyrics are way deeper then this albums lyrics."
4,very good album,"i am not a fan of the whole punk rock genre for the simple fact tht most of the music in it is lame & whiny. however, my chemical romance has come out w/the 1st punk rock album tht i genuinely feel is all-around good in a long time. my favorite songs are give 'em hell kid, to the end, ghost of you, & helena, altho i really feel the entire album is good. buy this album, trust me you will like it"
5,"Boy,oh,boy!!! These bands just keep on giving me joy!",All I have to say is.... JUST KEEP THOSE GOOD SONGS COMMIN'!!!!I'm SERIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,mrc is one with the underdawgzs,"i saw this band at taste of chaos before anyone had heard of them and before their debut album ""three cheers for sweet romance"" had come out. after seeing them live they really ""blew me"" away. after that i went to my usual hangout, hawt tawpik and bought like three shirts. i really think this band is kewl and i wish they had more that one album out. i really recommend that you pick this one up along with new (hed) P.E. i like to wear my make-up just like their singer, jerry. i wear everywhere i go b/c i'm am so original and no one esle does it. if you never hear of mcr you are a MEGA n00b!! lolzpeace,~*helena*~p.s. i changed my name to helena b/c mcr my rocks my socksp.s.s. i hear the misfits do a cover of helena, but can't find any of their cd's at sam goody. i do own like 4 misfits shirt w/ that skeletor on it. i wish i could work at hawt tawpik."
1,"Awesome, if You're an Ungrateful Teen","MCR is guilty of being the latest fad to garner mainstream success and acceptance from the teen population despite relative lack of talent. Disco, New Wave, Mallcore, and now this commercial brand of Emo are all fads that more or less die off when their fans grow up. The bad news is that this sort of music will continue to pollute the airwaves forever, but the good news is that this particular fad will die off in five years or so. This commercial tripe isn't even really emo, Fugazi was emo. I digress. As for the music, it's just what I'd expected. Poppy, angsty, and without much musical substance. Even the solos are pitiful, barely better than the leads regurgitated by Cobain on Smells Like Teen Spirit. If you're between the ages of 12 and 16 and think you're the most misunderstood individual on the planet, then buy this disc. If not, look elsewhere for music with some substance to it."
5,I may just be an enthusiast....,"but this is truly one of the greatest albums, especially in regard to more recent releases. I tried to be skeptical when I was listening to it first time around, and I think that's why I love it as much as I do. It's so hauntingly amazing that I just have to listen to it. Haven't stopped since I bought it Christmas day. It's very raw and emotional. Its lyrics may be somewhat graphic (depending on what you're used to), but they're really quite visionary. It's rare now to come upon a CD with this much integrity. 'You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison' is probably my favourite out of the thirteen tracks. However every song has something unique about it that hits the listener and makes an impact - that is if you really listen to it."
4,Worth The Money,"Overall, this is a great album, but some of the songs didn't makes sense. Other than that, it's worth the money.1. Helena - *****/*****2. Give 'Em Hell, Kid - ***/*****3. To The End - ****/*****4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison - *****/*****5. I'm Not Okay (I Promise) - *****/*****6. The Ghost Of You - *****/*****7. The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You - **/*****8. Interlude - ***/*****9. Thank You For The Venom - *****/*****10. Hang 'Em High - */*****11. It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A Death Wish - **/*****12. Cemetery Drive - ***/*****13. I Never Told You What I Do For A Living - **/*****"
2,Sell-Out,"Before you buy this album, go and buy MCR's first album, ""I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love"". Listen to it, compare it. Their first album is true and raw, this album, is a complete sell-out fake. MCR completely sold out to get rich, there is no intensity in this album, it's all cinematics. MCR's ""single"" I'm Not Okay (I promise), is without a doubt the worst song they have ever written, there is no intensity, it sounds like something you would find on some teenage boy-band. My advice, borrow the cd, listen to the tracks, give it back, and buy their first cd. Listen to something that has feeling, I recommend Drowning Lessons. Nothing from this sell-out."
2,I don't like to pay to listen to people's problems!,"More suicidal than linkin park, even more whiney than green day, it's my chemical romance! Why do people think it's cool for bands to cry their problems into an album like this and call them an inspiration??? If you ask me, you'd have pay me to listen to this cd that's nothing more than a collective pitty party. If anyone out there spent precious money on this, do us sain people a favor and don't bother us!"
1,It Isn't That Good...............At All,"I found this cd in the library, so I took it home and listend to it. About half of my school or so likes My Chemical Romance, and I like the most of the music that people at my school like, punk rock wise. But I was suprised so many people like this band, the guy can't sing, and the music is not so good. From the songs I listend to I heard no ones that I actually liked and I was very displeased with this album overall. It was a waste of my time listening to it, and I would not ever recomend listening to them. I heard that they're good live, but I don't know for sure myself casue when they came here I was busy at the Senses Fail/ The Bled concert listening to real music."
3,READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IF YOU LIKE MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE THEN YOU WILL LOVE ANBERLIN. GO TO PURE VOLUME.COM AND LOOK UP ANBERLIN, AND LISTEN TO SOME OF THEIR MUSIC. THEN GO TO BEST BUY OR BEST BUY ONLINE AND BUY THE NEW ANBERLIN CD NEVER TAKE FRIENDSHIP PERSONAL FOR A GOOD LOW PRICE. ALSO REQUEST THE NEW SINGLE BY ANBERLIN CALLED PAPERTHIN HYMN AT YOUR LOCAL ROCK RADIO STATION. AND IF YOU LIKE ANBERLIN(WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL)DO THE SAME(PURE VOLUME, BEST BUY) WITH THOUSAND FOOT KRUTCH AND EMERY"
2,Mostly a poor album,"'Ghost of You' is a great song. However, everything else on here is pretty bad. I like MCR, they have a lot of potential to put together some good music. Unfortunatley, not on this album. If you can get the 'Ghost of You' single, do so, but I can't recomend that you buy this album."
4,hmmmm,"i think my chemical romance is a pretty good modern punk/emo/hardcore band. i first heard of this band when i tuned into a radio station and the dj said that this as one of his favorite bands and i heard the single I'm Not Ok (I Promise)a couple days later. i liked it the first time i heard it and it eventually became one of my favorite songs on the radio. months later i switched my tv to MTV and saw the Helena music video. Gerard Way looks like he is about to cry throughout the song which is proof to me that he doesnt mindlessly sing about the sadness that he does. my personal favorites on the album are Helena, Give Em' Hell Kid, I'm Not Okay, Thank You For The Venom, It's Not a Fashion Statement(,)It's a Deathwish, and i Never Told You What I Do For a Living. the only thing that kept me from giving this cd 5 stars is that I can't really listen to it when I'm angry, and I have listened to it so many times, that all the depression kind of gets boring......its a great cd though buy it!"
5,It's great!,"I love each song in this cd, it's great! ever since I purchased it I can't stop playing it. It's been so long since I listened to a cd I like as a whole and not just a few songs here and there.Can't wait to listen their new stuff. Deserves all the five stars and even more."
2,Good Production + Bad Band= Decent Album,"I must say, this album was a guilty plesure for a little while. I think theres are well written pop rock songs. good hooks and everything but see this band live and it will change your opinion. I saw them last year open for Lost Prophets and they SUCKED so bad! It made me realize just how much of this album is production. The singer is TONE DEAF!!! He can't sing for his life! The drummer plays the same beat over and over again the guitarists have no idea what rythem is and the bassist may as well be playing a mop. This band is a train wreck live! MCR got lucky they got their songs produced this well! because before this album all they had going for them was their straigt out of hot topic looks. Download this album or buy it used because its not awful but for the love of god, don't see them live or pick up the first album because both of those experiences are quite painful."
5,Three Cheers for MCR,"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is by far one of the best albums of 2004. The screaming has been toned down but this does not mean that the quality has decreased. The lyrics are powerful and the sound created by the band is beautiful. Gerard Way's amazing vocals are complimented quite nicely by Frank Iero and Ray Toro's phenomonal quitar riffs, Mikey Way's wonderful talent on the bass, and Matt Pellisier's awesome drumming. This Sophomore effort was done quite nicely and is a must hear for fans of any genre."
4,Response to made up scare tactic below,"So which was it ""SP90210""? The parental advisory sticker or a good friend's suicide that tipped you off to the negative lyrics? I personally wouldn't mention the sticker first. In fact I wouldn't mention it at all.I'm calling you a liar because your story is cliche, and your tendencies conflict with your story. You obviously didn't even think of this little made up antecdote until you were already writing the review.You say you were tipped off by a sticker(or was it a friend's suicide) yet you already had the previous album? It took 4 paragraphs to start mentioning the main source of concern (friend's death)? A friend died because of their lyrics and you even give a damn to address the ""catchy tunes""?"
1,The new breed of rock music? New Breed of Chemical trash!!!!,"This is the album that made rich kids cut there writs, this is the album that made you look like a brat and this is the album that makes me want to start an emo genocide!!!!! you emos make me sick you look like your a walking Corpse. To all the emos out there grow your hair grab a cone and listen to some black metal."
3,"[give it a listen tho, it may be 4 u]","i cant say 4 tha rest of the cd (hence tha 3, going by the songs i have heard: helena, you know what they do to guys like us in prison,im not okay.) but from what i have heard it is appalling. completely dissimilar to the first, less screaming and more of a pop influence suspected. thumbs down. give it a listen tho, it may be 4 u."
3,Laugh Out Loud,"Ill never understand why ""metalcore"" people like this band which is the weekest of the emo/screamo/noise-core sub genre but absolutely hate everything else and think its trying to destroy ""real rock"".Go back to listening to Lamb of God and take this with you.Everyone else go pick up Silverstein's new album or if you like harder stuff Chariot's new album"
2,a little upset with this one,"Another band to totally popimify their 2nd release in the SAME month...(the other being alexisonfire). ""I brought you my bullets..."" was catchy but this?! Come on! This is just TOO radiocore. Looks like they only had enough in 'em for one. I hope they make lots and lots of money."
1,ThE sOuNdTrAcK tO mY dEpReSsInG LiFe...,"OMG. I love My Chemical Romance. There whiny vocals and mascara make me love them so much. I am such a relater. I love it when I am listening to MCR while writing in my online journal about how I got beat up by the safety patrol, and I wrote a sad song about it. It made me cry soooo mutch.I am the w i l t i n g f l o w e r... ~~~}@(If you bought any of that, three cheers for your ignorance. Pun intended. And I know that 0 of 1,000,000,000 people will find this not helpful, but, as stated before, that's fine.)"
5,Great Band!!!,This band is awesome. Overated you all say??? Not at all! I've seen them in concert twice now and I'd go see them a 100 more times! The world needs good rock music these days and thanks to MCR I don't have to listen to crapy radio stations for a while.
5,weird at first but lear to love it,"I thought this cd was really weird and gothic thing it was the first punk/emo/rock type cd I had ever bought, but I quickly learned to love it. I like all the songs except for ""Helena"" the bands second single just because I've heard it so many times. The best song has to be ""You know what they do to guys like us in prison"" featuring Bert McCracken (the used) it has great lyrics and a driving meleody. The best thing about this cd is it has guitar solos in every song which not a lot of bands today are doing. I definitley reccomend this cd to anyone who even listens to music. And to music fan ""manpmn87"" you are an idiot for rating the cd after only hearing on song off of it(Helena) and you still gave it two stars for one song. What else can I say that guys an idiot. Get this cd!"
3,A Perfect Example of Selling-Out,"MCR was a cult hit and was all the hardcore fan's ""little secret"". Sure, you could've gone in to Hot Topic a year ago and seen the shirt. That doesn't mean you could turn on your TV and be spammed with the overly played ""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"" video.The fact is, this is a perfect example of what happens when something like MTV get's ahold of a band. Now, everyones listening to this band. The used-to-be hardcore fans now just have to let this band sweep by them and be picked up by the Crossfaders.Well, while the CD lasted, it really was great. New breed of music. A kind for the emo, hardcore, rock, and punk fans in all of us. The lead singers voice is unmatched. You'll hear dark gothic whispers and high pitched screams, along with perfectly blended melodies.You'll like the CD, along with all the other couple million fans."
4,New Music Worth Listening To!!!,"can u believe new music worth listening to! My Chemical Romance is a great punk band, without the high pitch voices, and the repetitive sounds of every song. the stand out songs are great on this album, songs like...""Helena"", ""In The End"", and ""I'm Not Okay"" are catchy and great music. i hope they keep up the good work on their next album, good job guys."
3,"not good, not bad, it's just o.k.","maybe i was just expecting too much as they won band of the year by spin readers, but it's just not that good. this is similar to many other new punk bands and musically isn't particularly inventive or inspiring. this is definitely not emo, nor does it really have ""metal guitar riffs"" as a review suggested. it's not bad, i could listen to it as background, but is it great - not even close in my opinion. most reviews tend to be by people who love the band or the album and want to share their enthusiasm and interest (i'm guilty of that for several albums). this was one i was curious about with all the raves about it and it just didn't impress me much."
5,This is the Best CD I've Heard in Years!!,"The passion, energy and depth of this album is irreplaceable. Nothing captures the emotional storm of my own work in philosophy, like this does. The composition is tight, the hooks are marvelous and stick in your head for days. The feelings are a ""passion in tragedy"" torn out of you, and if you've been alive at all, you've felt them in tandem with the highest feelings we can reach.How wonderful it is to find such expression; it nourishes my soul for all I've suffered, in pursuit of all I've accomplished. For those who've read Moral Armor, (.com), this takes honors in Rock for Self-Made Man's artistic pinnacle. Can't wait for the new release!"
5,My Chemical Romance Strikes Back,"After hearing MCR's debut, I couldn't wait for this one to come out. When it finally did, I fell in love with it and it's been in my player ever since. This album is way different than their first. Better production - Gerard's singing and the band's songwriting have improved vastly.Some say MCR sold out because they signed onto a major label, but I say those fans are just bitter. You didn't think you could keep MCR in your backpocket forever, did you?Anyway, this album will kick you in the ass from start to finish and leave you wanting more. Ignore negative comments about this album. I would list the best tracks, but they're all great."
1,"Musically, this is a horrible album.","many people would agree that I have great taste in music. pretty much one of the many reasons I study music in college, along with being a musician. So listening to this album...I found so much wrong with it, musically. Didn't pay too much attention to the lyrics, but I can say the vocals did not redeem what I heard. Overall, the album is very sloppy. In their songs, they cannot stay on a consistent path or style. Their sound will not give you a chance to set it into your ears before it either goes soft or really loud, and you can't really understand whats going on. Not necessarily my prefered guitar style either. I can't believe Fall Out Boy said this band is better than them. At least Fall Out Boy stays a constant, steady path, with good lyrics, and if they change style, it's at the end, and it actually makes sense. Moral of the story: don't try to make all your songs sound like a quick paced medley, popping in about 10 melodies per song."
1,Whts with all the hype?,"I must say that I had heard so much about this band, so I decided to give this CD a whirl. I try to listen to all kinds of music with an open mind, and even though most of my reviews are for metal, I am not some Mullet-Metal head that goes around bashing anything that isnt metal. What I am bashing is the musical talent of this band. NONE! I understand that MCR isn't a flashy rock band and try to write simple songs. It just doesn't work for me. It seems like every single song lacks any kind of emotion or feel, and MCR might just be another flash in the pan punk-rock act. If you like simple music or this genre, then stick to Nirvana, Chevelle, or even old school punk/rock like the Sex Pistols or The Clash. This one is a solid turkey, and unless they do a huge turnaround, I dont see them lasting to long in the music biz."
2,Very dissapointed.,"I didn't like this as much as I thought I would. The only songs i like are the ones they released as singles. I'm Not Okay (I Promise), Helena, and Ghost of You. I'm sorry, but this album ia sappy. Most of the songs are ment to emotionally sad (or at least that's what i think)and you know what, they failed. Pretty much 54% of the songs have the same topic to it. Thank you for the venom doesn't do much. The lyrics are boring, the beats have all been don't before. My Chemical Romance made me realize that I don't like Emo music.This album isn't all bad, I gave them a 2 for trying."
5,Everyone has their own style...,"... and My Chemical Romance definitely owns a style of their own. To the trained ear, they may sound sloppy, and the like, but to untrained ears, they're absolutely wonderful -- almost everyone that I know loves MCR. I said almost. I listen to a variety of music, and yes, that includes my gangster shiz, and overplayed pop tunes, but honestly, this band is my *favorite* (and I honestly don't care what you people think about that). Gerard may not have an AWESOME singing voice, but it's so filled with emotion, and he does have his own style. The rest of the boys do, too, and I especially love the guitar parts, and the drumming. Although I cannot say the same for Mikey Way's bass-playing, the only song I can say that I heard him in was Ghost of You. (And from a girl's [non-goth.] P-O-V, he's uber adorable. :P )My absolute favorite songs on this album are... : all of them.N.B. -- this is but one girl's opinion, so don't judge others on it."
4,Not For Uptight Squares,"Are they over the top? Yeah. Are their vocals screamy and melodramatic? Certainly. Are the lyrics alternately cool and corny? Sure.But look at those song titles. They're selling an illusion. You need to listen to this album like you're going to watch a movie--a midnight showing of a popcorn flick that nevertheless rumbles with style and unnecessary action sequences. It's not reality, but it's not a fashion show either. It's entertainment.To some people, this means it's crap. I don't believe that. Listen to the energy in this album! Crank it up! If you can't burn up the nighttime highways with this music, you're too old to be listening to rock.My Chemical Romance have produced a fun record, full of irony and mocking and vented frustration and Hollywood goth costuming. The songs roar and they're catchy as hell. Don't think. Just rock."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"As soon as I heard everyone raving about this new band 'My chemical romance' I loved the name and decided I wanted to hear more. I first heard their song 'I'm not OK' which I deemed very Teen Angst and felt it was ok. A few of my friends wanted to see them in concert so I tagged along. After the third song, I left the house of blues!!!In concert they get TIRED after the first song and sound HORRIBLE.The CD was pretty good, but if you seem them live, you can tell they mess around with their voice a bit... but a few songs were good. The big ones, 'Helana' and 'I'm not ok' were rather good... but they are DEFINATLY not good enough to be as big as they are."
5,"Great Band, Great Album",Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is one of the best albums I bought last year. Its got great songs and great music. Rarely can I listen to an album all the way through and actually enjoy EVERY song. I recommend it to anyone. I've also seen them live and they were great. They put so much energy into their live shows and they really interact with the crowd a lot. They are just a lot of fun. There is a reason so many people say they are an amazing band to see live and there is a reason they are selling out all over the world. They're just that darn good.
2,Average,"i bought 2 sets of these (blue and black) because of the price and to really stock up. they look nice and just as pictured but the fit on these is less than desirable. if you (or your man) like to just wear their boxers when lounging around the house they may find these have an awkward feel and constraint. because of this constraint as far as movement i DO NOT recommend anyone wearing these if they plan on being even remotely active during their day. played a couple hours of basketball and these boxers were not comfortable at all.for everyday lounging while wearing shorts/pants then they feel fine.for someone who likes to run, jog, or play sports, i highly recommend finding a different set."
2,"Decent fabric, horrible band, couldn't notice the fit.","The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear."
5,Edward Thomas and similar poets: poetic treasures to find !,"This book is a very worthwhile companion volume to another recent book by Anne Harvey, ""Adlestrop Revisited: an Anthology Inspired by Edward Thomas's Poem"" (1999). Notable among the poets/""elected friends"" are: Eleanor Farjeon (friend and literary adviser of Edward Thomas, and author of ""Morning Has Broken"" - set to the music of the traditional Irish hymn ""St Patrick's Breastplate"" and popularised in the 1970s by Cat Stevens); Other poets such as Ivor Gurney, Walter John De La Mare and William Henry Davies and Robert Frost, to name a few. ""Elected Friends"" is a book to be treasured and frequently ""dipped into""."
3,Oh Memories,"This was the record that really open my mind to Bowie, VU and the like - I thought. I listened to it rabidly, read every nuance in Harley's voice, revelled in the music. And while the songs remain largely excellent, this record has not aged well.While Roxy Music's debut has maintained a voice, a tonality, a strength and a relevance, this record has turned into a pale imitation of that disc. Which, in hindsight, is what it always was, from the opening swell onward. I didn't give Roxy the proper credit for allowing me to listen to other music with an open mind... now I do."
1,This is dangerous material: should be made illegal.,"Much as I value freedom, the freedom to allow thinly veiled intellectualised racism-such as this book- should not be allowed. Milton friedman argued that capitalist freedom prevents the persecution of minorities, these books make me wonder.America seems to me to be the most racist country in the world, I'm thankfull not to be part of it: on the evidence of these American books."
4,A Well-Researched Obsession,"Prof. Kevin Macdonald did a thorough job of researching the Jewish condition and Antisemitism in the last 4,000 years. His scholarly conclusion is that Judaism and Western society are incompatible. He is not the first to say so, and among many others, Dr. Theodor Herzl (another Hungarian Jew) wrote books on the matter. Therefore, I was less than surprised to read that ""Zionism raises no special question"" (page 264). Thank you, Prof. MacDonald. If I am allowed to comment on the book (Having read Chapter 7 on Jewish rationalization and selfdesception, I do not dare to ask anyone to believe me), I would like to say that the author, like people of all ages obsessed with the Jews, tends greatly to exaggerate Jewish power. For example, he argues that historic demographic changes undergoing the USA (he does not mention Europe, but it is the same) are product of Jewish activity and serve Jewish interest. Halevay! as we say in Hebrew."
2,Not approved by the 3 year old,"I bought this CD to play at my son's 3rd birthday party (dinosaur themed) and neither he, myself, nor my 4 year old liked the music on this CD at all. If you're looking for a fun, upbeat dinosaur themed CD get Dr. Davvy's CD instead, we love that one. This one is too ""rock"" for little ones...they can't make out the words to the songs and prefer the beat of Dr. Davvy's instead."
4,A beautiful coat.,"The Jos A. Bank double breasted Camel hair polo coat is a gorgeous, comfortable, and warm wearing winter coat. Fit and finish is excellent. While not as thick or exemplary as other luxury men's brands such as Brooks Brothers and other back East retailers, this coat looks great and has all of the classic halmarks of a genuine camel hair polo coat including patch pockets, half belt, cuffs, and length which is getting very difficult to find in off the rack men's winter coats.The only thing missing that I would have loved is a welted chest pocket for that added bit of color, but for the price I could not have found better. Highly recommend J.A.B. coats for those looking to add a classic touch to their winter wardrobe."
2,Disappointing,"This book in my opinion is too short and much too sketchy in its presentation. I found Weinberg's book to be incomparably better for those seeking an introduction as well as a deeper treatment of the subject. The detail and careful development of the theory in Weinberg stands in stark contrast to the loose, just-describe-the-facts approach found here. For instance, Weinberg clearly atates and proves the Coleman-Mandula theorem and then goes on to give a rigorous derivation of the most general supersymmetry algebras. All this is glossed over in Freund's book."
1,a mathematical book,"I gave up reading the book after I finished only 3 chapters as I found myself too stupid and can't appreciate the book, to understand the materials on lie superalgrbras, you must be very familar the materials on classical lie algebras as stated by Humphrys, but for a graduate student not very care about the mathematical details of physical theories before, it is really a too high reqirement. But I have to admit it is a good book, I like the style of Freund's writing, I want to say that it's not so good for a graduate student doesn't have a solid basis on mathematics like me, but it might be better for another one who likes the mathematical aspects in physics. I'm tring to read a book on lie algebras to prepare for a future read of the book, I think it worthyful to spend some time on the preparation for reading this book. In addition, the book really contains many important and interesting phases in supersymmetry though it is a very small book."
5,2nd best metal cd ever!,"the 2nd best cd ever only after the band's previous recording, the amazing GLOOM. dennis the menace is by far the best drummer out there, nefarious an excellent bass player, and what can i say about corporate death's singing and guitar playing? i haven't heard anything about my favourite band since this album which is a great disappointment, i just hope that they are still around and coming to new york soon."
5,top notch murder metal,"How can you beat lyrics like ""Jeffery lived in Milwakee with 11 men, but they were in pieces 'cos he dismembered them"" I had this album for many years and it's a classic."
1,This is Disgusting!!!,This is the kind of trash popular with the type of kids who flip out and kill other kids in school shooting such as the one in Colorado. Artists like this should be boycotted - don't waste your money on music which advocates and encourages kids to kill.
2,"These Knights are for show, not for play","This Knight set is the most I've found for the price, but you get what you pay for. Although the scale of the figures is just right and the appearance is excellent, these toys do not ""play well with children"". The sword and shields are removable. However, you are likely to break off an arm while extracting a sword from the Knight's grip. This happened even to me, though I was being careful. I have used liquid nails to repair most every figure and even the ""working"" catapult. I would not buy this set again."
1,bad seller,"I placed my order to this seller and they just cancelled my order without any notification. I checked my email and bunk mail, but found nothing. Amazon.com explained that is because they are out of stock, so they can just cancelled it. If you want to order this item, be prepared the seller would do the same thing to you. They would just erase their record from your account without any explaination. And amazon.com could not do anything about their decision."
2,Weak...just weak :(,The price on these was right - but the quality of the product is pretty horrible. The rigiht ear piece is basically dead now after about a month of use daily. It seems like putting them in your ear breaks the speaker cone or something. Would not buy again. When they did work they sounded O.K. But I would've been better off putting my $8 towards a better pair.
4,Nice product,"Excellent product for the price. Not made for high volume + high bass (distorts slightly) but for everyday listening (i.e. decently loud), these earphones are hard to beat.Once the foam expands into your ear canal, bass quality goes up tenfold, incoming noise reduces drastically (less noise than workshop earplugs), with music playing, outside noise is virtually eliminated.For $12 shipped, I got way more than I expected."
3,OK if you modify them but....,"I didn't find the Koss Spark Plugs as good as some of the ecstatic reviews suggest.The major plus is that they are inexpensive (under $15). The sound quality is quite awful, with boomy, muddy bass, unless you make modifications. The easiest mod is to apply tape over the back of each earpiece to seal the little holes. With that change, the sound is just OK.As with all in-ears, you must insert them correctly to attain a good seal. Roll the phones slowly between your fingers to compress them; pull the ear up and back as you insert, wait for the foam to expand.The tape also improves sound isolation. Isolation is then not as good as premium in-ear 'phones (I have the Etymotic ER6), That can be an advantage since you're not completely cut off from the environment.Overall: Inexpensive and compact. Good for working in the garden or for keeping in the car or briefcase. Fine for audiobooks or other spoken material. Music quality is mediocre."
3,might be better off spending your $12 on something else,"They fit nice and comfortable in the ear, but what's weird is your footsteps become more noticeable when you walk. you can hear them thump in your head when your feet hit the ground. I dunno, maybe that's just me.With these headphones I can't use my bass boost function on my CD player because it's too powerful which really drowns out the music while listening with these earphones. Even with the bass boast off you get good bass from these, but the sound it still not as crisp and clear as I'd like. If you're an audiophile like myself and really care about how good your music sounds I'd take a pass on these earphones."
2,ouch,"These probably work well for someone with small ears. I'm no Dumbo, but I couldn't get the foam to seal properly. These earbuds hurt my ears...if you want to know what it feels like, take a sharp pencil and jab it into your ear. The sound was fine. Would have been better rated if different size foam covers were provided."
1,These are not worth $9 shipped,"Stay away from these headphones. They sound really bad, most $5 headphones at walmart will sound better than these. Stay away from these! I warned you."
2,Runners Beware!,"I bought these earbuds to replace the bulky ones that came with my mp3 player, and every time I run with them in I wonder if I made the right decision. The left one doesn't even stay in my ear past a mile or so, and they make a yucky sticking sound in my ear canals with every step. The sound may be good, but it's only possible to concentrate on the sound when walking!"
3,Wanted to love these...,"I really wanted to love these earbuds because they are so comfortable and fit perfectly in my ear. They drown out noise around me and I don't even notice they're in my ears. I've had so many problems trying to find earbuds that didn't hurt my ears when I put them in. Glory when I found these! Unfortunately I've went through 5 pairs and each one of them ended up the same way...shorted out near the ear piece. I take really good care of them, but every pair I've had seems to short out until one of the earbuds no longer works. I kept buying them because I loved them, but now it's just getting too pricey to keep purchasing over and over. They last almost a year, so I guess if you don't mind spending about 10 bucks every 7-9 months, go for it. They are worth the comfort if you can afford to replace them."
3,Not really noise cancelling,"Product looks exactly the same as in picture. purchased on amazon.com.- Blocks out very little outside noise. better than regular head phones, but not what i was expecting.- very comfortable- sensitive cord. makes loud sounds in your ear when you touch it or bump it slightly. this is very disappointing.- bass is good for me"
3,Not at advertised,"I purchased these back in January and was quite disappointed when I first got them. I was replacing a pair of the same headphones and these are not the same as they used to be. The picture is misleading. The ones I got did not have the 90 degree plug. It was a straight plug. That may not seem like a big deal, but plugged into my mp3 player and put in my pocket put so much stress on the plug that as of 2 days ago it failed. Only one ear works now unless I futz with the wire trying to get it to reconnect, then hold it in place - which is obviously not practical.In addition, this newer set seemed to have a different driver which was not nearly as bass-y without a re-adjustment of my eq... Again, just not the same. Not sure what to buy now. I wish they had left a great set of earphones alone."
1,Bigger than I thought,I was disappointed in the size of these buds. I thought they would be smaller. I probably won't use them.
3,Good value for the $$,"I had a pair and eventually one channel stopped working so I bought the same thing again. I like the fit and the sound is good. My only beef is they're not that durable, but that's to be expected at this price point."
3,"Great fit in my ears, not great sound","I had a pair of similar Koss in ear headphones that sounded much better. These are too tinny. I like that they fit in my ear and stay while I am active or exercising but I do not like the sound of them.I would like headphones that fit like these but have better sound quality and still not pay hundreds of dollars. I guess you get what you pay for, under $20 bucks.I am open to any recommendations out there."
3,Cheap earbuds,"These are good for people with small ears. The spongy tips fit better than most of the typical noise isolating earbuds in this price range. I bought these as a replacement for a pair of JVC earbuds that died after about 4 months of use (1 ear went dead). Unfortunately, these earphones had the same problem. For $12, think of these as a pair of disposable earbuds. You will be about 4-6 months out of them."
4,Very good noise isolation,"I was somewhat dissapointed in these earbuds treble response. The bass response was a little heavy at first but after a few days it seemed to balance out a bit. Upper midrange sounds a little nasal and treble is rolled off quite a lot. My reference is an old pair of $20 Koss/Realistic Pro35 Titanium on-ear headphones. I haven't found any earbuds that even come close in sound quality yet. Overall the sound quality in the Spark Plugs is decent especially for 12 bucks shipped. Sound isolation is excellent, I can't hear a word my wife is saying until I pull them out. The memory foam really is the ideal earbud material since it expands slowly after rolling them in my fingers and putting them in. In a few seconds the outside world is ""sealed out"" and you can listen at reasonable levels without endangering your hearing."
2,Variable quality?,"While others have found these buds to be pretty good, my set is horrid. They have underdamped bass, overbearing ""boxy"" mids and dull high end. The tape mod helps a little but not enough to make them listenable. I suspect that there's a lot of variation from one set to another -- they're cheap, so cutting corners on quality control wouldn't be a surprise. For the price they're worth a gamble but be forewarned. I've had much better luck with the Koss Plug (not ""spark""plug) units."
5,can last longer with fix,"I love these earplugs, but hate that they poop out after a couple monthes, then I discovered that its usually the part that plugs into the device that goes out. By tying a loop near the end and attaching that to clip of my mp3 player it took the stress off the plug and prolonged the life of it. I have been using the same pair for about 10 monthes now and both sides still work. And I use them every day!!! now if I could just get the foam parts in bulk!!"
2,"Overrated, even with tape trick","If you want cheap, knock-around earbuds, these should fit the bill. Make no mistake about it, they sound like $11 earbuds. Taping up the holes to subdue the sloppy base helps but does not turn them into a great set."
3,Not for large ears,"The sound is good. The price is very low. But if you have large ears and have to push them in deep, the sharp band in the middle makes contact with your skin. If you have smaller ears they would be a great buy."
3,They are okay,"For the price, these are okay, but I didn't like the foam plugs. They never really felt comfortable or stayed in my ears well. The sound was bassy, which doesn't suit my needs. I have since lost mine, but won't buy another set of these. Looking for something else."
2,eh.,"These earbuds aren't very comfortable, which might be handleable if they actually worked well. They don't though, so much so that attempting to listen to an audiobook left me unable to decipher whole sentences. I gave up in frustration, and was more than happy to go back to my ipod earbuds. Don't waste your time."
2,Sounds muffled with way too much bass,I had owned two sets of a previous version of the Koss Plugs and they have been the best headphones I have ever owned. They have become a bit ratty from extensive use so I was looking for a replacement. I figured these new Koss Sparkplugs had to be an improvement over my originals but I was very wrong. Whereas I would listen to my MP3 player with flat equilizer settings on my original plugs I now have to use a very weird user defined setting having almost all of the lower frequencies set as low as possible and increasing the higher frequencies. Even with the adjustments I can't seem to make them sound as good as my original plugs. I guess I will be in search of either someplace that sells the old version of the plug or a new manufacture's earplugs.
5,Very good for the price,"You really get more than what you pay for. Although I had to do a little extra work to get them right, and yet they are a little too big for my ears, but for that price, my God!!!First off, you have to glue the earbuds with crazy glue, because they come off really easy, second they don't come with a clip to hold the wire, but most headphones don't have that either.It takes a few seconds longer to to adjust to ear depending how you feel comfortable with how deep inside the ear they need to be.While you chew food you don't hear yourself as much as with other brands.Also, you don't waste as much battery on your device, at low volume they sound louder than any headphones.Believe you me, I did my research and you won't find better headphones for that price."
5,Great cheap in ear (ear buds),Comfortable the sound is great and they do a good job blocking outside sound.Buy a pair and stop damaging your ears with the stock ipod ear buds.
3,koss sparkplug,"these really sound good, but didn't last very long. Sure they're warrentied, but if I have to pay return postage every month, It's more like renting them."
2,Too Delicate,"I puchased a set of these Koss ""Sparkplugs"" from Amazon a few months ago and used them occasionally. The sound is fairly good, certainly acceptable for the reasonable price. But the earphones are really too delicate. The left earplug has already broken into two halves (front and back). I will try and ""crazy glue"" the two pieces back together and hope for the best. I'm a bit annoyed that they broke so easily."
3,"Muddy sound, but at least they stay in my ears","I purchased these to replace the ear buds that came with my ipod shuffle which are too large for my ears and won't stay in place.With the squishy foam that expands after you insert them in your ear, these do indeed stay in place.I discounted other reviewers' reports of muddy sound quality because I am not an audiophile. I did not expect to be able to tell the difference. I was wrong. The sound is quite bad. I suppose if you listen to a lot of loud heavy bass music they might be OK. I listen to a lot of accoustic music that sounds muffled through these."
1,"Uncomfortable, muffled sound","Is it my ears, or do these Ear Plugs sound just plain bad? Once I had them out of the package, I regretted buying them. Poor build quality, cheap looking plastic. The soft material fit into my ear canal alright, but the ""deep, rich sound"" everybody was raving about ... I just couldn't hear it. I was so disappointed, I threw them into the garbage. My worst purchase this year. $12 completely wasted."
1,"you buycheap, you get cheap","My first try at in-ear phones for ipod nano. I use mostly at gym where these things are impossible to keep in your ears once even one drop of sweat appears. Also, after two or three weeks the right channel is pretty much gone, barley audible. When they did work, sound quality was good and ambient sound isolation was fair. Only redeeming factor was that these were cheap. Makes me wonder about trying other in-ear phones. I'd hate to spend more money and find the same problems."
1,Will you ever learn,Something else that will end up in the landfill. Will people ever learn? It's just another $10 peice of junk. At first you will think they are not too bad and were worth the $10. But after a while you will realize you wasted another $10 in your life. There is no free lunch. Can you say ER 6 i? Cry once.
5,Great buy/great earphones,"For the money, by far the best earphones you can buy. They stay in place when you are working out and have deep bass."
1,These are BAD earphones...,"They never stay in your ear, that why I gave it a negative review. The audio quality is not so bad though, I appreciated the bass from playing music but they would would always fall off out of my ear so whats the point ?"
2,not good,"I bought these ear plugs for a road trip I was taking with my 8 and 5 year old boys, and these were recommended because they ""mold"" to your ear, and should have worked well for the young ones. WRONG. They didn't ""mold"" they fell out every two minutes for the whole trip. My kids were miserable. I would up stopping on the road and buying an over-the-ear style that works much better for the kids. As for sound quality - they complained about a hissing sound. I wouldn't recommend them."
2,You Get What You Pay For,These Koss headphones were a disappointment. They were bought as an improvement for the stick Sansa headphones and were actually worse. I ended up giving them away. I would steer clear of these and spend the money for a better set if you are looking to improve the sound of what came with your MP3 player.
2,Puedes conseguir mejor sonido,"Este producto es de buena calidad en sus componentes externos, pero la verdad no me sirvieron para lo que necesitaba, para monitoreo, tiene poca definicion de bajos y medios asi que si lo quieres para escuchar tu musica en tu MP4 Player esta bien, pero no te desgastes tanto..."
1,Awful !!! JUNK,These plugs lasted about 4 hrs. before the right one stopped working. I bought these brand new from Amazon direct and called to return them shortly after receiving them. Sound Quality was not all the great and kinda muddy no matter how they were placed in your ears. I would not recommend these at all but your mileage may vary...
3,"Good for the price, but bassy and fragile","I like these headphones, but you have to be careful with them - they break easy. Also, these seem to be very heavy on the bass, which is good for music but bad for podcasts or audio books."
4,well worth the price!,"Top of the line, no. However, these are a great set of ear plug speakers that I think are not too far off from the $80 ear buds I bought last year. I bought two sets because they're such a good price."
5,Great fit and sound quality for price,"For the price - these are great in-ear headphones.The form mold plug fits well, and when in correctly, the sound quality is great. I like the strong bass it provides. They are comfortable for extended wear and noice cancelling (I wear them on planes all the time).They are not perfect. I would have liked the core to be of a better quality, and with heavy use, they do not hold up very well. But a this price, their replacement is affordable."
2,Had high expectations,Based on the reviews I thought I'd finally found quality earbuds that didn't hurt. My ears must be made differently because these hurt as much as all the cheaper brands I've tried. Not much to say other than that.
2,Mediocre,These head phones were not what I expected. Koss makes great ear buds but these don't have that deep bass sound to them. They are cheap and I would not get these earbuds again.
2,Too fat!,"I have never thought of my ears as small, but these ear plugs don't fit well into my ear canal - they're too fat. So they're constantly falling out. The sound quality is good, but not worth the hassle of having to constantly put them back in."
5,A nice and inexpensive upgrade from Apple's IPod headphones,I have had several pairs of these over the years and have to keep buying them after lending them out or gifting them because these Sparkplugs are so nice and cheap. They do a decent job of isolating too even though they are not isolating headphones. The bass is impressive in these (which means some may need to turn down the bass while others will finally enjoy hearing it for the first time). If you lose or are dissatisfied with your IPod's headphones (or any other player) I would highly recommend these as a cheap replacement.
3,"Good, but not great...","Disappointed with the stock ear buds that came with my S1MP3 iPod Nano knockoff, I went looking for something with better sound without breaking the bank.As for the tape trick (covering the holes) is concerned, it does help reduce the bass. However, if you shove them into your ear to far, you can still have mushy sound. As with all ear buds, positioning is critical to getting the response you like.As far as overall sound quality is concerned, the ear buds from my ancient Diamond Rio PMP300 sound slightly better to me . They are 'brighter' with better mid-high end response, although with slightly weaker bass. Some of that could be related to positioning within my ears however.Overall, I would rate them as 'good'. A noticeable improvement over the stock ear buds than came with my Nano clone."
2,Distorted Sound,"The sound is a very deep base, even with the tiny holes on the outside of the ear pieces covered by tape. The sound produced is loud, and my mp3 player needs to be turned down to it's lowest volume setting. The plugs that fit in the ears are uncomfortable, and tend to fall out when I jog."
3,Too much bass,"I'm a rock music lover and am quite fond of bass in my music. These ear plugs, however, give so much bass that it actually drowns out all of the instruments and the vocals. I don't recommend them."
4,Good upgrade,"Just purchased these for use with an ipod. The ones that came with my Nano were huge, uncomfortable and produced terrible sound. These new Koss ones are a very decent improvement. Comfy, great bass but muffled highs/treble. The black insert portion that actually goes in the ear is dense earplug foam. I think that this foam is negating much of the highs and midrange. Bass gets through just fine only because bass, or low frequency sound travels differently than those in the high khz range. High frequencies are more easily deflected and absorbed, as the foam is doing here. All that aside, these make great gym or activity headphones that can be cheaply replaced for good sound."
3,Good enough for $12,"I don't demand the utmost in sound fidelity, but like so many others have commented I also found the bass on these earplugs to be so overwhelming that it drowns out all other frequencies. I put tape over the back of the plugs, and that helped muffle the bass enough that I can now hear the higher frequencies.Still, these are cheap earplugs, so don't expect top sound quality. I find that the foam tips on these earplugs fit my ears better than a pair of more expensive Sony earplugs that take those replaceable foam covers. Granted, the sound quality is less than those higher-priced earplugs, but I can wear these Koss earplugs for far longer in comfort."
2,I don't like it as much as JVC marshmallows,"Sound is pretty decent, I haven't had the glaring issues others have. It sounded comparable to but slightly worse than my JVC HA-FX34 Marshmallows that I intended to replace with these. The bass is there, but the higher frequencies don't come through as clearly as I would like. Again comparing it to the Marshmallows, the spark plugs lack the presence I feel with the other earbuds.The construction is very light weight. The big earpieces probably fit most ears, but they did not fit mine very well. They always felt like they were on the verge of falling out, though I never ran with them to see if this would happen (this problem is easily remedied by buying silicone replacement eartips, but that is beyond the responsibility of the consumer at this price range). Also, the cord would not straighten out and is prone to tangling.It's OK overall but I would not buy another, considering the Marshmallows are about the same price and more widely available in stores."
4,Koss Efficient,Much better ear plug than the original I-pod plugs. You have to get use to the squishable outer surface but it does a good job of isolating outer noise.
2,koss sparkplug,"horrible headphones, i really dont understand how people can tolerate the sound quality from these headphones. Please stay far far away, buy ep630's or jvc marshmellows and get the best sound for your money!"
5,"High Quality, Low Cost Ear Plug",I like the fit of these ear plugs better than any others that I have tried. I believe the sound quality is better then some of the 'noise-cancelling' models as well. A lot of the 'noise-cancelling' models seem to clip the highs and lows. These ear plugs do not do clip the highs and lows so I feel like I get a better listening experience when I use them with my iPod when traveling on airplains and automobiles.
4,The Spark Plug,I would have to say that these ear plugs have the best sound of any ear bud style I have used. They also do a good job of reducing ambient sound. My only complaint is the hassle of compressing the foam earpiece and holding them in place until the foam expands.
1,I hate these headphones!,"I just bought these headphones at a CompUSA store that is closing and I can't return them. Even though they were only $15 they aren't worth a penny. I can barely hear anything that comes out of them, they fall out of my ears, and are very uncomfortable. I really think anyone that rates this higher than one star is being paid for their reviews. I will sell these to anyone that wants to see how much they suck for half the price I got them.Buyers beware! These headphones suck no matter what they cost. I could get better quality form dollar store headphones. Stay away!!! I hate them so much I felt like I needed write a review. At least I'll know I might save one poor shmuck $15."
2,Pretty good sound that won't last long,"I really like this headset because I have small ears and standard earbuds will not stay in my ears. To date, however, I have gone through 4 sets. Though the sound quality is good, the headset seems to quit after about 6 months. Granted, I listen to my Nano nightly for 2 or more hours per night, but I am quite gentle with them. Can one be more gentle than to listen while sleeping?! Standard Apple-issue earbuds last longer, but lose their little covers all the time, which is annoying. If you really want to try in-ear buds, these are good ones if you can get them cheap and in bulk. Just don't expect long-term performance. And consider super-gluing the earplugs onto the main earpiece (carefully so you don't plug up the sound!). I found this really reduced my chances of losing them."
1,Sparkplugs that do not fire!!!,"They sound real muddy, All bass, no back ground sound, You get what you pay for,"
5,Nice!,I use these instead of over the ear headphones while playing my Roland V-Drums. They are much more comfortable for long periods of use and they sound great!
4,decent product,"More difficult to fit in ear than other non-electrical foam ear plugs, but definitely stay in my ears better in the gym than other ear plugs. And as cool as the plugs look that came with my i-pod, those hurt my ears. These do not."
3,"Inexpenisve, but way too much bass","The Koss SPARKPLUG in-ear phones amazingly have way too much bass. They are comfortable for short periods (less that 1/2 an hour) with the included foams. The isolation is not as good as a Shure or Westone earphone. I read about some hacks for the SPARKPLUGS and did my own modification. I have all but one hole covered with tape on each earphone. This brought the bass response down to a level which no longer masks the mid's and high's. Overall, for $15 and some tape, you can't beat them. The cost of entry for the other models I mentioned is at least $100."
2,Couldn't Get Them to Stay In,I was really hopeful with these in-ear headphones. Unfortunately neither I nor my wife was able to get these to stay in our ears. I've tried several of these and found the Shure SE110 to be the best one...
3,Koss Sparkplug - Have the tape handy,"Out of the box the Koss Sparkplug stereo ear plugs have way too much base. If you buy them like I did, put scotch tape over the sound holes and the ear plugs sound pretty good."
4,"Sound is great, not easy to fit it in","Koss SPARKPLUG Ear Plugs are one the best ear plugs that I have used esp. for that price range. The bass is not too high or low and the clarity is exceptional.I have given it 4 stars because of the way you fit it in the ear. Every time I have to spend at least 5 minutes adjusting it before I am comfortable with it. As opposed to some other reviews, I would not consider this as noise cancelling ear phones. Unless you have the ear plugs firmly inside your ear, there will be some background noise."
3,Almost Perfect,"The concept is great - insertable, moldable foam earplugs. The problem I had was keeping them in my ears because the outside of each plug is much heavier than the foam part that you insert. For someone else's ears, these might actually be perfect!"
3,Okay for running,"I purchased these because I work in a loud office and a friend at work said they isolated very well and had great bass. I've used them for a couple of weeks now and I had to go back to my Jlabs JBuds J3 headphones. These Koss headphones arent made very sturdy. I find they never seem to seal completely in my ear and the bass IMHO sucks. its not tight, and you just don't feel it in your head. the Jbuds I have seal perfectly and they offer a much better sound quality. I feel that regular ipod headphones sound better than these spark plugs.I now use them at home for when I go on my runs because they stay in the ear very well for exercising. I've gone many miles without ever having to adjust or put these things back in."
2,bad cable quality,"These are good while they last (which is not very long) around 2-3 months. I've had about 4 of these because I don't want to be carrying them around, but always want to have them handy. The cable quality is extremely bad in all the ones I've owned. They have not been abused since I don't carry them around and if I compare them to the the ones I use with my nokia cell phone which are really abused you can tell the difference, the cable for these feels really thin."
3,"Great deal, but youll be buying new ones every 2-3 mos","Pro: These are cheap and sound fantastic. They cancel out the noise on the subway, are very comfortable and have a great low end.BIG CON: I've owned three different pairs of these, and all three times one of the buds stopped working about 2-3 mos in so I only had sound in one and had to throw them out. It happened with two different mp3 players, and I've never had the same problem with the skullcandy buds I've had for 6+ mos (which dont sound as good as the koss sparkplugs).If you want to buy these, my advice is to buy three pairs to save money on shipping, and you should be good all year. Or pay more and get something that lasts."
2,Not the old Sparkplugs!,"I bought two pairs of Sparkplugs a few years ago and was hugely satisfied with them, especially the sound quality: deepest, richest bass I'd heard from a tiny earpiece. THESE ARE NOT THE SAME! While what I purchased looks just like the old product, the sound quality is completely gone, now just as tinny and thin as all the other in-ear speakers I've tried. If you want even modestly decent sound quality, look elsewhere!"
3,Beware of dumb shipping charges,"I was about to buy these earbuds, but then I noticed that the shipping charges are silly. The earbuds cost around $5 depending on who you buy them from, they weight 4 ozs, and yet the minimum shipping is almost $8. I wanted three sets, and I discoverd that the shipping charges simply multiply - raising the price to $40. Buy 50 units, and you get stuck for $400 to ship a 12 lb package. Take a trip to Walmart!"
4,Good headphones.,"I'm happy with these headphones. I think they are a little bass heavy, but I'm ecstatic to find expensive iPod compatible (aesthetically and instrumentally) phones."
3,"sound is OK, but terribly poor fit...","there's no way in the world to stick these earbuds inside my ear canals, the only way to get sound from them is holding them with my hands. I tried squeezing the foams but it didn't help either. they might be good for you, if you have ""normal size"" ear-canals, but with my tiny ears they only represent a collector's item for me. Koss makes great headphones and I wish I could've rated it higher, but they simply didn't work for me."
4,Awesome Bass,"I bought these because of the reviews about how deep the bass sounds. I listen to mostly rap music and these ear plugs deliver a deep rolling bass. It sounds like you have your head next to a couple of 12"" subwoofers. The mid's are OK, but high's are lacking when listening to rock music. Luckly i have an EQ on my MP3 player so i can turn the bass down a notch or two. If you don't have an EQ, you can try the tape mod trick as one of the other reviewers mentioned to soften the bass. You also don't have to turn the volume all the way up like with some headphones. My MP3 player has a top volume of 25, but with these ear plugs i can't go higher than 15. I would definitely buy another pair."
1,DON'T BUY THESE,"Maybe my ear holes are smaller than everybody elses. These things fall out of my ear when I smile, or when I frown, and I get a complete upper body workout when I walk with them on...first it's one falling out, then the other. They would be best used with super glue. I really don't understtand ear buds, give me headphones with the over-the-head band anytime."
3,longer than an earplug,"I bought these at amazon, thinking I had found an old set like my dad had which looked exactly like an earplug with a cord on the end. nope. these have the earplug part, but they also have a plastic pedestal-type part on the end which is where the cord is. This makes them a half to 3 quarters of an inch longer than an earplug, which means they don't fit my ears. returned them and got theJVC HAFX35S Soft Marshmallow headphone (Silver)which are shorter but sound just as good. I'm glad I was able to."
3,Good value,"I purchased these as a replacement for the ones I somehow burned the cord on. My original set lasted me about 10yrs. This set is identical to the original set. The frequency response is approx. 25 or 28 hz up to roughly 21.5k... This is not a set for an audiophile. They will become uncomfortable in your ears after 3hrs, and painful after about 4. The sound quality is ok, but nothing to write home about. BASS is strong, mids are mostly undistorted, and highs are present but muted. Aside from that, the sound is accurate. So in summary: Good value because the sound is tolerable for the price. I would recommend these more for Rock, Rap, or similar types of music, not for Classical, or softer pieces requiring absolutely accurate sound reproduction."
4,Made not to last.,"Don't Like The in Line Volume..(Will wear out Fast)I thought I ordered Without, but I guess I was WRONG!!"
4,Pretty good,Bought these basically to have something when i bike.Not too great for running even though they stay in the ear for longer than others.The sound is a little bassy but the frequency response is excellent with virtually no distortion.They are comfortable to wear. The foam blocks out some of the ambient sound.
3,"Not very comfortable, but good sound","The SPARKPLUG's black, soft thing that goes into the ear is too short, such that the hard plastic rubs againnst the ear and makes it pretty uncomfortable to use them. I find the PLUG to be much better. The sound is good though.If you like pain get this one, if you don't like pain too much get the PLUG."
2,"Decent but too large, fragile","If you're considering these headphones for use with a motorcycle helmet, skip them and get ""The Plug"" headphones, also by Koss. The bodies of the Sparkplug version are too large unless you have a really loose helmet. I've also had issues with the plastic bodies separating (they snap back together) trying to fit them under my helmet."
3,"Love the fit, sound could be better","Let me start off by saying I own 3 pairs of these: work, home, and one for my girlfriend. The cushion fit is great, and even when jogging, I have yet to have them come out. They do a pretty good job of canceling out noise around you when the music is on, even slightly. What I would say is a con is the muddied sound. On my computer, I had to adjust the media player settings to boost the treble so much and it took a while to get the sound I could live with. My mp3 player, I didn't feel like changing the same kind of settings because I use it in my car and wouldn't like the sound. Why did I still get 3? I thought the comfort, canceling out work noise, and price were good enough to live with the mud. If you're a 'sound enthusiast', I'd go elsewhere, but if you want cheap comfortable ones, try them out, they're so cheap."
5,Wonderful Sound and VERY Comfortable,"I just purchased these and I am impressed. I tend to favor much higher treble settings and lower bass, so after reading other reviews complaining about the bass I was expecting to have to make modifications.Well, I did not experience what other reviewers have - maybe Koss has improved them. My pair sound perfect without any modifications or equalization, and covering the outside holes actually made them sound shrill and tinny. The sound from these ear buds compares very favorable with my MUCH more expensive Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones.These ear buds are also very comfortable. After wearing them for only a few minutes I no longer notice them.Sound isolation is pretty good. My PC has noisy fans and even when my MP3 player is set to a low volume the sound of the fans goes away as soon as I start playing something soft like Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 (yeah, I highly recommend that too).Overall, this is a great product that can't be beat for the price."
4,Not bad,"I bought these to use on trips to India that included long flights and layovers. I got a pair of Koss over-the-ear style headphones for use when I wanted some noise to filter in (flight announcements, etc) but I also wanted a pair to block out the world. The Sparkplugs did exactly that. The foam inserts expand within your ear to provide a snug fit that keeps out external noise. I agree with other reviewers that the bass is a bit lacking, but as has been suggested, simply blocking the holes on the outside of the buds corrects that completely. My only complaint is that after a while, one of my ears always got a bit sore. Might be because I have pretty small ears that all buds have a hard time staying in. Regardless, these are worth having. For longer term use, and for when I don't need the sound cancelling, I liked the Koss Portable over-the-ear set.Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones"
2,Good on comfort and price. Too much bass for me.,"On the positive side, these can be comfortable to wear and provide decent sound isolation.However, I find the sound to have way to much bass for my taste. I followed the suggested mod to tape over the holes in the back, and that makes a big difference. However, the result is still too flat sounding to me."
4,"Good sound Isolation, OK sound quality","Not quite comfortable when wearing it, but it's durable to wear at least 1 hour.Sound isolation is good, cannot quite hear the outside world;The sound quality is just so so, or, not good at all. But I don't expect really good sound quality with this price."
1,Worst earphones I ever tried,"I tried these on an iPod Nano and listened to an audiobook. The voice sounded very muffled and hard to comprehend. This is after I set the iPod's EQ to ""spoken work"". There has got to be something better out there."
4,Plugs work well for Adults,"The plugs work great for Adults, but not for kids. The compression blocks out other sounds well, but the kids don't like the large size plugs inside their ears."
3,"great for some folks, but not for me","To start with, let me say that I don't think my ear canals are shaped quite like the average. I'm in the medical field, and I have never been able to hear through the Littmann stethoscopes with the comfy squishy ear tips that are supposed to give the best sound. They have the effect instead of plugging my ears and not directing the sound into my ear canal. With these ear buds, the same thing happens, but only in the right ear. If I keep shoving at the right ear piece, I can hear out of it for a while, then it slides out a fraction of a millimeter, and I lose the sound on the right again. They are not (for me) particularly comfortable, either. That said, I gave them to my 13 year old son, who loves them. He can hear out of both ears, and says the bass is way better than with the headphones that came with his Zen Nano. I continue my search for the perfect headphone..."
4,"Rewarding...very, very, very rewarding","These are great buds for the price. Noise isolation works excellent. A bit bassy, but I put tape over the ports which solved that problem. The only complaint I have is that my right-side bud lost sound after about seven months. This is why I had to give them only four stars. I'll probably end up buying another pair though."
2,you get what you pay for...,"These headphones are inexpensive but do not function very well. First, I had difficulty with them staying in my ears when I run. Second, the sound quality is poor and after a few uses, I am not getting much sound out of the right side at all. Third, the cord seems to be made of a material that must have been specially designed to tangle as much and as often as possible.I don't have any other suggestions but intend to order a set that is more likely to stay in during exercise and am willing to pay more if it means I will obtain reasonable sound quality."
2,Not the right phones!,"These koss headphones are decent, I heard they were not that reliable and people were right. They will repair any headphones for a flat rate of 14 bucks. One problem these are 12 dollar headphones! They fit in the ear in a strange way that causes them to fall out. I recommend buying some phillips headphones, They fit in the ear much better and sound more balanced. These do have a nice sound though (besides the muddy bass) what im trying to say is stop being cheap and go buy something a little more and save yourself the trouble of needing to replace these."
4,Sparkplugs make your radio run,"These compact earplugs have great performance, keep out most exterior noise and transmit voice very well.Another surprise: they don't tangle. Even after wrapping them around a mini-radio they extend to needed length quickly"
2,Good sound but not comfortable.,"The earlier version of these sound and fit much better, get those instead."
3,Too Much Bass not enough Highs!!,The headphones fit great in the ear but have way way way too much bass. I mean I would have to change all the settings in my ishuffle and increase the treble in order to hear any midrange or high tones. I would not recommend these to anyone who hates bass heavy music in the ear. I love bass as much as the next person but not so much that I cannot hear the lyrics well or any of the instruments.
2,Poor Performers,"These are not the usual quality associated with the Koss brand. The compress and expand fit for the ear buds are difficult to manipulate and uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. The sound reproduction is also very poor, almost muddy in effect. I threw them away and bought a pair from Sony which were far superior at about the same price."
5,"lightweight, good sound, & keep a lot of ambient noise out","I've used these for quite a few years now, but the one thing that always bothered me was that one plug always went dead after a few months, and I'd have to get a new set. Granted, I used them when working out among other things, so I gave them a beating, but it was still annoying. I then bought a much more expensive brand, based on reviews I read here at Amazon. And I have to say, those others REALLY annoyed me. They're too heavy and didn't fit into my ears as well. And because the wire's heavier, they're more cumbersome. Also the sound was supposed to be so superior, but I found very little in the lower frequencies. So I'm back to these. And I have to say, the ones I've gotten recently don't seem to break as quickly. Maybe I'm being more careful, or maybe they're making them better, but for the 12 bucks or so that I spend, they're definitely worth it."
5,Sleep well!,Is a very good ear phone. Sometimes I sleep listen music using the Koss Sparkplug and sleep with music is a good thing to do...
1,All-round bad phones,The cable broke at the plug less than 2 months after I bought it. Very uncomfortable. Save yourself the trouble and get proper phones.
3,Good,These are the only ear plugs I've ever had that did not hurt my ears after having them in for an extended amount of time. They are very comfortable and isolate out other noise well. Can't beat the price.
4,Nice Disposable Ear Buds,"Great for the price.This earbud hits the sweet spot in the price/quality graph, in my opinion. When you start spending for earbuds above this model, you are going to run into stiff diminishing returns very quickly."
2,"Good sound and isolation, but uncomfortably big for my ears","A friend recommended Koss Plugs; the Sparkplugs seemed to be newer (and had supersaver shipping) so I got them instead. I'm happy with the sound -- nice and clear, no boomy bass like so many earbuds have these days -- and the noise isolation is amazing, vastly better than standard rubber-plug earbuds. (They do whistle a bit outside if there's any wind; a bit of tape over the holes on the outside, as recommended by another reviewer fixes that.)The down side is that the plastic part is too big to fit my ears, so after 20 minutes they're painful, and changing the cushion didn't help. So I've given up on them and switched to Koss Plugs, which are much more comfortable."
2,These are OK,"They were OK, then they broke after only a month of use. Manufacturer will fix, but the shipping back cost close to what a new pair would be."
2,,"I love bass, love love love it. But the bass on these were completely overpowering. And even using the EQ it didn't help much.I read other reviews who said teh same about the bass, and I was excited because I really like to have a lot of bass, but again, just too much."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Well, at least they only cost 10$ For that amount, I'm not so disappointed that I can't get out of bed in the morning or anything. HOWEVER I wish I had taken the 10$ and put it towards a better quality pair of headphones.There is ZERO bass thorugh these little buds."
2,They are ok but there are better products for same money,"When I bought these I was looking at them for my MP3 player. However, I found ""Smokin Buds"" Inkd earphones for same price and far superior comfort, sound and general wearability. My wife and daughter liked the fact that they could get colors to match their ipods- and neither of them liked the spark plugs- too ""squishy"" and too heavy, and they tend to slide out if exercising."
1,Terrible,"These headphones absolutely stink. They look horrible (imagine the bolts that stick out of the side of Frankenstein's neck coming out of your ears), the wire is thing and cheap, the foam insert is cheap, and they flatout don't sound good.I bought these about two months ago, used them three times, and here I am, back at Amazon buying a new pair. Do yourselves a favor, and spend the money on a good set of headphones. I would honestly rather use the headphones you get on an airline than sue these Koss Plug headphones again."
2,Average ear Plugs at best...,"I purchased these ear plugs because of the high amount of positive reviews and low cost. Even though it comes with extra inserts for the ear plugs they are the same size. They don't stay in my ears very well and have that loose feeling. The sound quality is average at best. The only reason I bought these is to upgrade my stock ear plugs, but the Koss are worst than what came with my mp3 player. I plan on returning them Monday."
2,Yuck,Not at all happy with these earphones. It doesn't stay in very well during running. Good thing it didn't cost alot.
2,Skip them,"These phones are poorly built. The cord looks like it will snap under its own weight. The memory foam is of low quality, and In my opinion uncomfotable. The mute button somtimes stuck. However, the sound quality was descent, and completly isolating. Very boomy bass, but highs where somewhat muted. Not a bad pair for 20$ phones, but do yourself a favor and put a little more money together and get up to the next tier, say the 50$ range. Thats when things start to get truly impresive. These koss are somewhat of a gimmick."
2,Kinda Fiddly,"Sound is very bass-y, and they are a pain in the rear to get in your ear. Maybe good for setting down for a night of listening, but not that handy for on the go. I went back to my iPod buds."
4,Sparkplug,"good product, the white piece is bulky, works great on the motorcycle, sound is awesome great bass"
4,These have very good bass.,"These have very good bass, although they don't sound as good as my Sennheiser CX300. The price is cheap so I mainly use it when I'm on the streets so, if someone steals it I wouldn't get very angry."
3,decent value for the price,"Weird plugs...bigger looking in person, fit is not that good but hey i dont have perfect ears. sound quality is decent, definitely better than ipod/generic earbuds. cord is long, but thin and seems very fragile. hopefully these will last me a couple months. compared to sennheiser cx300 and skull candy ink'd earbuds, these are inferior imo, and would spend the extra couple of bucks for the skull candy ones.update...broke in under a month..."
5,must have for runners or working out,I have been extremely happy with the sparkplug head phone. Any other headphone I have to keep putting back in my hear when when I do alot of running or movement
1,"Great sound, but short life span","I bought a pair of these abroad, that pair had a bent plug. After a few years I needed a new pair and since I'd been so happy with them I got these. In the pictures the plug is bent, the delivered pair had a straight one. They broke within months. The sound was great, but when they're not durable at all, that doesn't really help. :-("
2,pros and cons,"great product, comfortable, blocks outside noise, good sound... downside is that I can't get a pair of these to last longer than 5 months of using it abou7 hours a week."
3,Good Value,They work fine as backup headphones and use at they gym. Sound quality is okay and noise blocking is good. Bottom line - the price was right at around $15.
5,Excellent sound,"I don't normally review items unless they are worthy. Bought these for less than $4 on a special, and they are worth every penny. My old foam plug in-ear phones were getting a bit rough, and the sound had always been a bit dark. The sound Q with these is excellent and bright, with lots of bass extension. I have to turn the sound down as it's much clearer now.I use them for working out at the gym, and they don't fall out, even when hanging upside down to do inverted crunches. so nice compared to iPoo headphones that aren't good for much beyond standing still.Hoping to see another price deal come back around and I'll pick up a set for the whole family. They come with an extra set of foam insert. Excellent buy."
2,Can't keep in ear,"When I first got these they looked like some female contraceptive, they don't sound bad but they stick out too far and want to fall out. I would not recommend."
3,OK sound and isolates well,"Not the most comfortable, but sound OK and does isolate from all extraneous noise better than many other ear buds."
1,No Bass,This is the third time I have bought these over the past few years. Quality has declined. There is virtually no bass - sounds thin.
4,"Serviceable, compact, inexpensive","I've ordered 3 pairs of the Koss ""sparkplug""-beginning several years ago. They're super comfortable in the ear. Affordable way to get stereo quality without the bulk of larger set (which I also have). I like that they deliver good-enough sound & no worry if I sit on them (or some one else does) or if I lose them completely.BTW if you're concerned about EMF emissions, these emit .1mg and less. I had an expensive, stereo set that in some places on the head 'bow' it was emitting 65 mg-- I ditched it! (You can buy an affordable Gauss/EMF meter here on Amazon. I'm surprised how many things in my home spewed out high # of emf's before I set about remedying this."
2,Disappointed in Sound and Fit,"Granted I have VERY SMALL ear canals, these were not comfortable. I have had Sony and Creative canalphones, the kinds with rubber tips that were more comfortable and sounded better.These were very boomy, and I don't mean punchy bass, I mean a big muddy boom. I am making music, and these are completely unsuitable. Also very tinny. Midrange has a definite cut in response.If you have normal canals, and don't mind the loss of definition in the bass area, and you want the cheapest buds you can find, maybe these are it.RETURNEDFor me, the Creative Labs EP 630 ($19) is WAY betterCreative EP-630 In-Ear Headphones"
5,Good sound!,"These headphones deliver real bass and, if your ears can accommodate them, also shut out a lot of outside noise, allowing you to listen at greatly reduced volume. I say ""if your ears can accommodate them"" because they require that you squish their little protruding pads, stick them in your ears and then have the pads expand. If you can do that, they seal off outside sound well. Sometimes I can't do that, and they fall out of my ears. But for $8.88, I figure you can't beat them. They sound better than $50 'phones I have."
2,They fall apart!,"Well, these would have been great ear plugs. The sound was awesome, much better than the ipod plugs. However, three short months after purchasing them, I can no longer use them. Reason? The black portion that goes into your ear - it falls off very easily. I have already lost both the originals AND the extras that came with the plugs. As careful as I tried to be, they fell off somewhere.The black parts did not fit well - not tight enough on the other part of the earpiece. that's why they just kept coming off.Too bad, poor design. Wish I hadn't purchased them."
1,Not very good,"I purchased the KOSS Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs - The Spark Plug, to replace the earbuds that came with my ipod. I am now back to using the pair that came with my ipod, for two reasons. First, the sound is muddy and leans towards the bass end. Probably some people like this kind of inaccurate sound, but to me it was unacceptable. Second, the rubber surrounds that hold the earbud in the ear don't work well and are not comfortable. I'm glad I only paid $9 for these. They now reside in the back of a drawer, never to be seen again."
3,Average headphones,"These headphones are bad about working their way out of my ears, even when I'm not active. If you don't have them inserted just right, you can't hear any bass...and apparently my left ear canal is too small or misshapen to make a good connection. I got these headphones at a good price, so I'm not crying about the quality, but given a choice I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Faulty wires,"As a medical transcriptionist, I am always looking for good headsets/phones that cane be used for hours on end (at least 8-12 hours a day). I initially liked this product and my first set lasted for about 6 months, before the right side stopped working. My second pair worked for an even shorter amount of time before the right side, again, stopped working. I then switched to another product."
3,"No highs, too much bass","I wanted an ear plug that would stay put, be comfortable, be efficient, and of course sound good. It does everything except sound good. The ear buds that came with my MP3 player are much better sounding. The Koss Spark Plugs have no highs, are kind of muted, and have way too much bass. The equalizer adjustments on my player can not be adjusted enough to compensate."
2,Will not buy again,"I had used these earplugs previously and was satisfied enough to order two more. However the sound is now tinny and there is not enough base. The earplugs are too big for my ears and keep falling out. As far as noise cancelling, I need a little noise as I am always walking near traffic and need to be aware of what is near."
3,didn't last,I think the sound was pretty good but one ear stopped working under normal listen conditions.
5,Great Value for Price. Smart Choice for Cell Phone MP3s.,"Very impressed for the price. Good bass and treble and very clear mid-range. Because these earbuds put the sound closer to your eardrums, while closing off outside noise with expanding foam plugs(covers), I found it takes only a little over half the volume(power) level setting on my Cellphone player to get the same ear volume as my larger sony non-plug type earbuds and even larger sony headset I had been using.This means I get sound as good or better as my larger headset, using less battery power, and in a much smaller package. I call that a triple play. Good job Koss.PS: For those not used to earplugs, they may be less comfortable than sit-on-the ear headset type phones, no more uncomfortable than non-plug earphones. A tip when inserting them is to hold the plugs so their leads point straight out in front of you. Then begin to insert them while rotating them as you insert them further so leads finally end up pointing down when fully inserted."
5,good for the money,"If you've got 9.99 to toss and you want good noise canceling cheapies with boomy bass these are the headphones for you.They are definitely worth it.I like clean tight bass...but I wanted something that canceled out absolutely all surrounding noise, was extremely cheap, and had decent sound.Note: The boomy base is easy to fix with the ""tape"" method.""Great for sleep, coffee shops, annoying noise in local libraries, and just about any other crowded place that you might be in, where you'd rather feel more like your out in the Ozark Mountains on a warm sunny day.""-darren"
3,Would have been good if it didn't break so quickly,"This set of headphones is so cheaply made that the wires broke and started cutting out the sound after only a few months. And I paid over $30 for these so I was expecting them to last a little bit longer. The upside is that they fit comfortably in my ear with the foam padding. I am always in search of a comfortable set of earphones that won't fall out of my ears when I move around and these did a better job than some of the other earphones I've purchased. If you can't afford anything else then I'd say these are ok, but if you can find anything better for the same price I'd highly recommend a different set of earphones or a different brand all together. I'm quite upset that I've only had these for a few months and now I have to search high and low once again for a good reliable pair that won't break."
1,Horrible headphones,These ear plugs are awful. I had a pair of sony funtopia headphones that broke so I decided to try these. The sound is so colored they are imposible to listen to without heavy EQ. The bass is muddy and overpowering. After a few weeks of light use the in line mute button has started to cut out so I have to wiggle the wire to get both channels. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for a pair of these. They are absolutely terrible.
2,Not so great,"I got these earphones and at first they were AWESOME! But now into week two and wow things have changed. The sound cuts in and out, the one cool thing about the headphones is that there is a button where you can mute the sound. Well if you bump it and touch it in anyway it mutes, which is kinda annoying. The sounds great, a little bassy. If the sound cutting out problem and mute button thing was fix, these would be the best headphones on the market for the price"
3,Great till it dies a month later,"Pros: I love the bass on this thing. Love the noise cancelling due to its shape that plugs into your ear hole that practically blocks out any opening to the outside world. I've tested this against V-MODA Vibe Earbuds, and its on par with the level of volume and bass. However, not as clear, and V-Moda you hear just all the sound.Con: This broke for me again after one month of use. I always wrap it around my mp3 player because its convenient. The left side sound comes in and out depending on how you adjust the wire at the base, kind of like a bad TV antenna. This is the 2nd one which broke, and to the same effect, the left side went dead."
3,Nice sound Cheap cable,"For a few bucks I really enjoyed the sound coming from these phones. I took long walks and no problem, ever. But after a year or so the left channel stopped sounding and that was all. I wouldn't mind paying more for the same concept but with a better cable, Koss really used the cheapest cable, no doubt about it. Maybe the idea is us buying at least 5 o more units of the sparkplug. For me sound:5 stars cable:1 star (non positive stars are not allowed)"
3,You get what you pay for,"I heard that these would sound way better than the earbuds that come with an ipod. . .and they would stay in your ears. . .so I bought two pair! But, I stopped using them because they don't sound any better - and they don't stay in your ears - and. . .they work like an earplug when music is not playing so you are cut off from the sound of the surrounding environment. The price was right - I'll give them that - but I would not buy them again - I'd use that money towards those $100+ E-shure? or whatever they're called. Save up and buy something good. Sorry - but true."
2,"good isolation, sound quality lacking","Pros- foam inserts fit me well, squeeze and shove em - in about 5 seconds to re-expand, creating a tight seal that's pretty good at filtering most noise- cheap- cord length is not too short like some sennheisersCons- sound like music is coming from behind a styrofoam wall, even with the modifications suggested by the #1 review on this product- muddy bass- unclear mid-highsAlso, I note that it does not take very much power to drive them...I have my ipod on the lowest possible volume setting without being muted, and it sounds plenty loud in a quiet environment. Sucks that the sound quality really isn't up to par. But, they do what you pay them to do, that is to attenuate outside noise, and allow you to listen to music. I vote against these unless you really don't care how they sound."
2,You get what you pay for,"Like any of the reviews that indicate sound quality isn't that great, I must agree. The sound has too much bass and is muddy. The earphones do fit nicely in my ears though (similiar to earplugs) and so they work well enough to block out surrounding noise (I use them at work). I'd recommend the sony MDR-EX51LP earphones over these. They're more expensive but sound MUCH better."
2,Beware replacing old SPARKPLUGs with these,"As at least one other reviewer reported, something has happened with these phones. I had a pair that was purchased years ago, and they were fantastic. Unfortunately, the wire broke on the right earbud, so (silly me), I assumed I could get some new SPARKPLUGs and be on my way. Wrong. These sound tinny and harsh, and they can't handle hardly any bass without severe distortion. I am very disappointed. I'm ordering some Sennheiser CX-300 canalphones to see if they do any better. One thing is for sure: When I *do* find one I like, I'm getting about 5 pair, hopefully enough to last me until I go deaf or worse."
2,Unreliable,"You definitely get what you pay for with these. Bought them because I had lost my iPod standard headphones for $14 at a local store. The cushioning of the earpieces made it possible to keep them in for long stretches of hours without ear soreness. The main issue with them was that they stopped working after 2 months. The wires attached to the inline mute button came loose on both ends, requiring 5-10 minutes of fiddling with the wires and positioning, until I could get a faint stream of music, which went away the second the wires shifted and were disconnected again. Koss customer support still hasn't responded to any of my emails for three weeks now.Buy them if you just need cheap decent headphones, but don't be disappointed when you need to buy a new pair in a few months. At least for $14, you can afford it."
3,Not good for big ears,"Two negatives with these, the first is they are intended for smaller ears, and the second is the black foam is REALLY soft, too soft in fact to hold these securely in place."
2,not good for small ears,"I thought that I would love these earphones, after talking to a friend who liked his. But, they don't fit properly in my ears. I have small ears and thought the squishability of the plugs would be perfect. Alas, the squishy part was ok, but the driver part wouldn't sit properly. So, they never felt like they were in properly, and never felt settled. And, as a result, did not keep ambient noise out. I am now in the market for some better ear buds, and will certainly pony up more cash for a better product."
4,Response from a colleague.,"I enjoyed your book. It is very ready friendly. Tying in ""Popular Culture"" is very effective. I am the author of ""What Smart Couples Know"" which is on Emotional Intelligence in Couples Relationships. Within the next year or so I will be doing a re-write/update.I would appreciate a review from you of my current edition of the book. I am also launching a research project on relationship skills. Would you be interested in participating in that? Dr. Pat Covalt"
1,Terribly Boring,"I chose this video because I thought the trailer was hilarious. Sadly, the trailer was the only part of the movie that was remotely entertaining. The movie degenerates into slapstick bathroom humor and masturbation jokes."
1,Amazon,"The movie itself was pretty boring and dumb, not much of a background story or a very good story line. And the quality of this video was terrible, my led ever looked so bad."
2,Baby Makers,Didn't even watch a third of this movie til I turned it off. I felt that it was kind of disguting! Maybe you will enjoy it more than I did!!
2,Mediocre,"The banter between characters seemed forced. There were a few cringe-worthy moments, but overall...not worth the money or the 5 star reviews."
1,Really terrible,I thought because I loved Beerfest and Super Troopers so much that I'd like this one too. Not so. Definitely pass. Neither my husband or I thought it was funny in the slightest.
5,Lots of laughs,Not sure why the critics gave such bad reviews. Lots of laughs. Typical Jay Chandrasekhar/Lizard humor . Mr Chandrasekhar is hilarious.
3,"Only ok, not worth the $8",The previews made this movie look so much better than it really is. It starts getting ridiculous and not funny at all. Drags on. I would save your money!
4,Papa's Daughter,Papa's Daughter is the story about a young Swedish Ministers daughter that comes to the United States with her family as a part of her mothers dream. Button is a very rebellious girl that makes you laugh through her stages of life and ends up finding happiness and reliving her life through her children. A must read book!
2,Disappointed,"I find this DVD to have poor instruction, and the names of ""sets"" are unfamiliar to me. I feel like it may be outdated since it was released in 2007. I also don't like the lack of instructed warm-ups and cooldowns. It makes the experience feel disjointed. Overall it's difficult to follow what Ana Caban is doing, and the poor camera angles don't help. I also didn't feel challenged by this DVD at all, never broke a sweat even though I consider myself a beginner. Perhaps I'm not doing the movements right, but since there's no guided instruction I can't be sure.I'm mostly interested in a quick Pilates workout I can integrate into my rushed mornings to help get me up and feeling awake.Although I don't hate it, this DVD really just doesn't do anything for me, and I'm pretty disappointed."
2,Not great,It is a lot of the same stuff over and over again. I wouldn't buy it again. I don't like it too much.
3,OK pilates video,"This is an ok video. I have only done the regular workout so my review is only for that part. I bought this to use for days that I cannot make it to Pilates class as an alternate to my other Pilates video. The scenery is great, music similar to other pilates/yoga videos I've seen. I'm not sure how to explain the level but I didn't feel like I had a very good core workout. There were several hard moves but more for the quads than core. It was difficult to focus those exercises to the core. While nothing beats going to a class, for a great core workout video tryClassical Pilates Technique: The Complete Mat Workout Series. The background isn't very inspiring but the workouts are all great."
2,Not Ana's best...,"If you are looking to gently sculpt your abs, this might be a nice addition to your workout routine. However, I did not find this challenging other than the teaser, which is always a challenge. It was a nice, gentle pilates workout, but it did not cause me to break a sweat at all. Look to10 Minute Solution: Rapid Results Pilatesfor a full, challenging pilates workout with many of the same moves."
1,not intermediate,was on an intermediate pilates site and ordered the tape. It is advanced!!!!! It will never be used again or viewed again
2,Not really for beginner,I've never really done pilates in the past but I heard it's good for strengthening your core (which I REALLY need). I think this video is too advanced for me and I wasn't really sure what she was talking about. I'll have to look up some words. I also don't have the core strength to keep up through the whole video. I wish she showed an optional way to do the pose if it's too advanced.
3,"Not much of a ""Challenge""","I was really disappointed when I got this dvd because I love Ana Caban-I think she is a wonderful Pilates instructor. I have been doing Pilates for several years now and would consider myself at the upper-intermediate level, and although I really enjoy her ""Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss"" DVD, this one was not as challenging and sort of boring, actually. I think it could be a good Beginners workout, but overall-save your money-there are definitely better Pilates DVDs out there."
2,Rescue Me,"High School Photographer And Looser Fraser Sweeny (Stephen Dorff) Is Infatuated By Classmate Ginny (Ami Dolenz)...After He Wittnesses Her Being Kidnapped By Two Dim-witted Crooks, He Bribes A Vietnam-Vet Drifter To Help Rescue This Beautiful Cheerleader And Win Over Her Heart...With Satisfactory Acting, And An Enjoyable Adventure, This Movie Is A Typical Action/Comedy...Starring Peter DeLuise, And The Charming Ami Dolenz"
4,Funny Little Movie,"This is one of the rare comedies done by Michael Dudikoff(the first was Bachalor Party with Tom Hanks, and the second was a film called Radioactive Dreams) and is quite funny. Dudikoff is Mac a Vietnam vet, trying to make a deal, when two kids drive up.One is kidnapped and Dudikoff is blackmailed by Dorff(Frost from Blade) to help rescue her. The two hate each other and naturally grow to be friends. well worth a look."
1,"Laughable, Idiotic and just Stupid (may contain spoilers).","I had read the write up on this and was happy to view it on TV BUT had to give up halfway through, where she realises something is wrong. Instead of calling the police like anyone else in the same situation she starts climbing on very unsteady trash bins (of the metal variety) to get a look inside the house, that and she's wearing very high heels and a short dress. Knowing the bins will go over and the bad guy will hear her (which he does) she carries on climbing, she is so stupid it's beyond belief. I just gave up watching this dross then, I mean come on, people don't do this - unless they either have a death wish or are really really stupid.Personally I would not pay to have my intelligence insulted by this trash, it really is a waste of money to watch such dire nonsense."
1,A bad representation of Judaism,"The authors of this book starts off by telling their non-Jewish readers that they are not bound by the 613 laws of the Torah, just the seven Noachide laws. They then proceed to indicate that in order to properly follow these seven laws, these same readers are bound to all of the rabbinical interpretations found in the Talmud. They continually call for the death penalty for various offenses mentioned throughout the book, and call for stoning and strangling as appropriate penalties. In one place, the authors state that it is a violation not to stone an offender. Many other actions are called forbidden in an apparently arbitrary manner. There are frequent not so subtle references to Christianity and other belief systems throughout the book that are quite uncomplimentary. Truth should stand on its own without these kind of inflammatory comparisons.My opinion is that this book does not represent mainstream Judaism and should never have been published."
4,Quality,This was a high quality used item. I was very pleased with the condition and timely manner in which it arrived to me.
5,The Best Book on Arnold !!!,This book is excellent. I could not put it down. I knew a little about Arnold but this definately changed my thinking. This is not the traitor that we learned about in grade school. He was a great American --- gone wrong---but why ??? Simple----the ignorance of Congress !!! Heard that one before ???? With the way he was treated by Congress -- I would have sold out too!!!
3,Suspect,"I read this book a few years ago, and found it fascinating and informative. Recently, I've read another book by this author, ""Thomas Chittenden's Town, the Story of Williston."" Having grown up in Williston, I found that book full of glaring historical errors. That makes me suspect the author's true commitment to research. Now I can't help but wonder, ""Were all the interesting facts about Benedict Arnold true, or did Randall take a lackadaisical approach to his research on that book as well?"""
2,Not A Good Book,It was hard to read the book about Benedict Arnold and was old book on the cover was ripped. Do like Revolutionary War
2,The Bean...BEANS!,"The Bean is a neat exercise item -- or would be if it didn't LEAK! Mine lasted about two weeks until it sprung a hole right along a seam. Tried to fix it with the included vinyl patch material, but it won't hold airtight. Thing stays inflated long enough to use, but it's a pain to have to pump it up every single time.Deal was pretty good...but wound up being not so great due to poor product quality."
3,Air leaked,"I really liked this product, but it leaked air after 1 week. I had to send it back. I tried fixing it and the patches didn't work. I wish the manufacturer made the materials better. It is really good on your back, and not having to get on the floor. It really worked my mid section where needed. Very disappointed."
1,The Bean - What a disappointment,"Once I figured out how to inflate The Bean, it was a great item. It felt good to use and helped stretch out my back. But, after using it only 3 days, a hole developed in a seam and the patch would not fix it. Bummer."
2,No trouble holding air,"While I see a lot of people have had trouble with their Bean holding air, I haven't had that problem. Mine has been inflated since mid May and I haven't had to put any air in it since. My problem seems to be that if I don't really concentrate on the move, I'm not really getting anywhere. I still think nothing beats the old standard manual exercises - crunches, etc. I wouldn't purchase it again, but I do still use it once a week - with concentration. : )"
2,Deflated.,"I borrowed this from someone, box unopened. (They received it a couple of months ago.) At first, I thought it was a good alternative to a fitness ball because of its stability. I was able to do many exercises that I can't perform on the fitness ball, for example the ""Superman,"" and I figured it would be a great way to build up to more demanding exercise. Plus, I hate getting down on the floor to do ab exercises.I was even considering buying the deluxe version. But in less than two weeks,it's gone completely flat. By contrast, my fit ball, which was filled well over a year ago, is a little squishy, but still perfectly usable."
5,Great for Back Rehab,I have degenerative discs in my low back and the Bean has been a life saver! They had it at physical therapy and my therapist recommended I buy it. I bought the Bean Deluxe and it has helped a lot! It is easier to use than a regular exercise ball and offers more stability. I love this product.
2,Not a great workout at all,"The Bean slides all over the floor/mat/carpet; it also tips over; basically, it felt very unstable. The instructions on the video are not clear enough; nor are the visuals repeated long enough to learn. Finally, I felt nothing in my workout--just rocking along with no feeling in the abs, legs, etc. I work out in a gym, so I'm used to a great session and knowing I have worked out; I wanted to try this for at-home exercising to supplement. Instead, I gave it away and use workout videos. Save your money."
1,A Better Option,"You can buy the Multi Flex Core Home Gym for anywhere between $29.95 to $59.95 (plus shipping and handling of approximately $12.00). It does exactly the same thing as The Bean, but with many advantages. First is the price, as I've already mentioned. Secondly, it's made of metal and plastic, thereby getting past the most mentioned problem of The Bean (losing air, total deflation because of rips or holes), and last of all, you can grasp the sides with your hands to remain steady or not slip off (another problem people have with The Bean)."
2,Holds Air Not Shape,The Bean Deluxe arrived with a hole & the included the patch kit worked fine. I also topped the air via large spout & it held the air without a problem. I purchased my Bean Deluxe the end of February used it 5-10 times a week & by May it totally lost it's shape. The Bean Deluxe is definitely easier on the back & neck; however the product needs to be updated as I will not spend $50+ every 3 months to add to a landfill. I will research other products.
3,Bean workout,I have had this product before a few years ago and wanted one again. It is a good workout. The only thing I was disappointed with was that it said something about being wider and more comfortable and I didn't find this to be true. Overall a good workout.
2,Didn't match the picture,"I love the original bean...the one pictured, but what I received was a light blue color and the bigger one which is too hard for me to use, because I am short!"
4,Whimsy & Triumph,"Howard isn't one of my always-must-have composers, but on the basis of this CD at least, perhaps he ought to be. The second track, ""The Egg Travels,"" perfectly demonstrates the range of the music you'll find here. ""The Courtship"" has a bouncy traditional-African sound to it, while ""The End of Our Island"" is eerie and tension-building, rising to a brief, thundering dissonance of volcanic eruption. ""Raptors/Stand Together"" successfully evokes an action-filled attack sequence--at one point you can almost ""see"" the steadily approaching feet of the carnivores pounding against the ground. ""Finding Water"" is filled with the joy and relief the travellers must feel; ""The Cave"" has a mystical, marvelling feel to it. And so it goes. Howard clearly immersed himself in the rough cut of the movie and came to know it well. Definitely worth your time."
5,A superb composition by James Newton Howard,"One of the key elements of the success of ""Dinosaur,"" the animated film from Walt Disney, is James Newton Howard's fine orchestral score. ""Dinosaur"" is unusual for a Disney animated film in that it contains no conventional songs, thus breaking out of the ""animated musical"" mold. But the musical score still needs to help define character and complement the plot, and Howard rises brilliantly to the challenge.The disc's second track, ""The Egg Travels,"" is a soaring, triumphant piece that sets a tone of epic adventure. Another outstanding track is ""The End of Our Island,"" which uses frenzied percussion to bring across a sense of apocalyptic menace. ""The Courtship"" is a joyful piece that incorporates African-flavored chanting.""Dinosaur,"" with its portrayal of talking dinosaurs and lemurs in a prehistoric world, was a visually rich film with engaging characters. James Newton Howard did an excellent job scoring this story."
4,"players behind ""Dinosaur""","A great new score by James Newton Howard. Great themes, tensionand a trill to listen to. [...]If you liked Waterworld, the Lion King you will enjoy this one too."
5,Classic from Old School Death Metal the way it should be!,"I've like Dismember for years now. This is a classic release of epic proportions. It is old School Death Metal, but refined. Dismember is a great Death Metal band. If you don't have this then you aren't a true Death Metal fan."
5,classic,"I'm not going to break this album down,but I will say this:I agree with the other fellow reviewers when they say Dismember are way talented and probably THE most underrated death metal band ever!This album is one of their older albums but I believe it is their crowning achievement.It is a classic and it is one of the ten best death metal albums ever!The track ""Dreaming in Red""(which is really the last track on Indecent and Obscene,the other 6 songs are from Pieces I believe)is, believe me when I say,one of the single best songs ever!It takes me to a whole other strange plane.Try it under the influence of some reefer.Swedish Death Metal friggin' rules!"
3,Pretty good,"As a huge Metallica fan I've seen various documentaries through the years and read tons about the band and honestly I found this to be a pretty interesting and entertaining video to watch. I even learned a few things in the process though if you're still learning about the band I think it's an even better watch as it does do a good job of walking you through the history of Metallica. I put it on fairly late not intending to even get through it all and found myself wanting to watch it to completion. While I tire of the seemingly obligatory Load/Reload bashing (though St. Anger probably deserves it) I did enjoy the more complicated look at Lars and his motivations behind the whole anti-Napster issue and his personality in general. Personally, I wouldn't buy this DVD but it was certainly a worthwhile and entertaining Netflix rental."
3,If you don't have a strategy guide forget it,"I love the Myst Series and I'm sure this game is great, I loved it until I got stuck and frustrated with it. If you don't have the strategy guide you might as well hang it up. Do not get the online strategy guide from CheatCC.com, they leave out alot and there are alot of mistakes. One bad thing if you want the startegy guide for this be ready to shell out some cash because it is out of print, I've seen it from $35 to $85 I guess considering the condition of the book. I really don't feel like spending that much $ on a $15 - $20 dollar game no matter how much I like the series. I guess I should have played and beat the game when it came out because it's to expensive now. I have never seen a strategy guide go for that much, it's ridicilious. Anyways if all that wasn't the case I would give this game a much higher rating. If you're a fan of the series I highly recommend this but if you're looking at this as a new game to try out I don't recommend."
3,Myst III,"You better know what this game is about before yougo out and get it.You can only move by pressing Abutton.I just don't see this game taking off on theconsole like it has on the PC.Alot of people who don'tknow what this game is about are going to end up disgusted.It's a puzzle/strategy game,so forget about suitin' upto slay the dragon.I don't mean to slam this game,it isvisually beautiful,just don't run out and buy it if you'reexpecting an action,RPG,Shooter,etc.."
4,I love these games!!!!,"First let me say I played the first 2 games in this series and I liked them both ; however, they are not for everyone. MYST games are puzzle games to the highest standard. In one instance you might turn on a switch and it does absolutely nothing with in the vacinity of your immidiate senses, but somewhere in another area you're turning on power to a generator on a cart that you can travel around the ""island"" on. Let me be the first to say that these types of games are hard.. I mean reeeeaaalll hard .. *I'm not talking about looking up cheats or reading walk throughs for this game hard , anyone can do that and pretty much beat any game. It's definetly a break from first person shooters, and fighting games... rent it at least see what it's like then come back and buy it."
4,Nice Change of Pace,"Myst III is not (for obvious reasons) typical Xbox fare, but it is just the sort of thing to cleanse the pallet between games of Halo & Madden. Hopefully there will be a niche for this type of game on the Xbox in the future."
4,A great CD for Little Dancers,"My daughter is 2.5 and she absolutely loves to dance. We have listened to this CD every day since we got it. It has a great beat and no, the songs are not original, but they are fun and don't have any questionable things in them. If your little one loves to dance, then this is a must have. Mambo #5 is one of her favorite songs I really like the Disney version of it. :o)"
5,"Searing, honest, funny, great","Jeanne Achterberg breaks the mold of illness memoirs and healing tracts with her searing honesty, wit, fresh prose style, insight, and sheer spiritual brazenness. What a joy to read, a powerful investigation of the sorrowful, tough, often elevating experiences of this wounded healer going deeper to try to heal herself, and the personal losses and gains that occur along the way. Bless her for being so nakedly honest in sharing the hard truths about her marriage and personal life in a way that doesn't make the reader feel like a voyeur but like a dear friend who needs to know about the intertwined tentacles of her life as she lives it, and as she tries to extend and expand it both by turning within and by reaching out. Actherberg helps us understand that illness can be a metaphor; it all depends on what metaphor we construct, what truths it holds, and what we do about it."
1,Get something else,"I really thought that the Plantronic's name meant quality. I gave up trying to keep this thing on my ear. Not doing my homework properly, I didn't understand that the conical ear piece is the part that hangs on to your ear. The rest of the frame is, I guess, for show. Its pretty unstable and kind of flops around in your ear. I never got comfortable enough with it to evaluate the headset for its sound quality. Another wasted $35.00 I am pretty soon going to give up buying anything on-line. There's something to be said for old fashion brick&mortar stores where you can see an item and try it before you waste money on it. This wasn't worth the time and expense to return."
2,low price = low quality,"I purchased the Canon D1250U2 and the HP 3570C. The HP modelcost a little more but the difference in quality is amazing. The HP model is much better than the Canon and even scans faster.The Canon picture did not have very good details. With a picturewith someone's head, the HP defined the hair very clearly as well as the rest of the picture, the Canon model kind of blurredeverything together.I do not recommend this scanner and I am returning it to Amazon."
1,not good for batch scanning,"as mentioned before, this scanner takes up to 15 secto adjust the lamp before each scan. it therefore isone of the slowest scanners around.the only thing is excels in is moire/descreening.it is 2x faster than other scanners we use.color pages at 300dpi take 15sec + 26sec (usb2)color pages at 300dpi w/ descreening 15+40secif not for the stupid scan driver readjusting the lampeach scan, it would be a great scanner."
3,Good scans,"I got a great deal on this scanner so I couldn't pass it up. I did initially have some installation issues in windows XP that took some time to get straightened out. The scanner produces nice scans and is very fast via the USB 2.0 connection. But over the last few months I've devoloped a weird haze on the underside of the glass and Canon seems less than enthusiastic about fixing or replacing it. I don't notice any difference in the scans, but my guess is that the haze will only get worse and will eventually effect the scans."
4,"Great, with a few..","exceptions. It's a really great product, enough so that I bought a second. Using them for aquarium equipment, I can easily turn off individual items. The ports are tight, so all of the plugs are able to stay in.As another reviewer mentioned, I don't know why there is one outlet without a switch, and I would prefer the master switch to be on the opposite side of the cord. It is a bit expensive for what you get, and the outlets are a little close for some adapters."
2,not salsa,"If you are looking for great salsa that we have come to know from Fania do not look here. This album has an all star cast playing disco beats with an attempt to sell more records and play large venues. If disco is your bag I suppose the record is fine, but if you are looking for great fania salsa stick to the individual artists such as Bobby Valentin, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon and all the other great Fania artists!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I have enjoyed Salsa and in particular various Fania albums for many years. I was excited to check this one out because it had good reviews. However, this one just did not meet my expectations. It seems like a collection of B sides from different albums. It doesn't have any really lively hits. It's not even like smooth and cool or anything. I just can not recommend this album. At best it is just ok. I actually gave it to someone else to check out because I didn't even want it. I am a big Salsa fan so believe me I know good Salsa. This album is just blah. Like I said B sides."
3,Watch the spoons,"I got this product because I needed conisters and spoons/scoops. One of the spoons was a little long, thus it would rest on the counter rather than hanging. I just set the spoon on top and it works fine. I can not speak to whether this was a insignificant error or if others are this way. But They hold and seal well which is the key. The smallest conister has a real funny looking spoon because it is so short."
2,Horrible & Cheap,"I only gave these two stars because they do half the job of storing food/items. I thought these would be sturdy like the ones I found at Wal-Mart, but they were soooooo cheaply made. The lids are barely attached and can ""wiggle"". The metal parts are so thin and cheap. I do like the included spoons though. I don't believe these containers create air-tight seals, but didn't read if the description said they do. The IDEAL acrylic containers have thicker, sturdier lids with rubber ""stoppers"" for airtightness, and are ""double-walled"" (I don't know how else to put it) sort of like for insulation? They feel heavier like glass. Don't buy these."
3,"Delivery was long, seller had poor customer service","I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a friend but it did not come in time for Christmas so I saved it for her birthday instead (which was shortly after Christmas) and had to run out and get something else for Christmas. I did contact the seller to ask if it would be on time but received a generated response that said ""we have received your inquiry and will respond soon"" but I never got a response. I did receive tracking information a couple days after my email was sent so I knew when to expect the shipment from that.Canisters are pretty to look at, does not appear to be very strong plastic but at the low price, I guess you can't expect it to be. The spoons are an awesome addition and very convenient!My friend loves this set and I am considering getting one myself...I already have an acrylic canister set but I like the spoons that come on this one."
5,Great books & charaters from the Revolutionary to WWII,"My mother introduced me to the Williamsburg Series when I was about 17. She had inherited the series from her mother who had bought them new from the Peoples Book Club. Now I have introduced my 17 year old daughter to the books, and she is enjoying them as much as her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. About ten years ago my mother bought the series for me and now I will buy the series for my daughter. These are great books that can be read again and again."
4,Good and Sweet,"Like many other reviewers, I first read this book and the other Williamsburg novels in my teens. I loved them, and read them repeatedly. That these books are so beloved of teen-age girls forty years ago should give a good idea of what they're like. This one is probably the best, but all are sweet love stories with an interesting historical setting--good plots, memorably noble and heroic characters, and happy endings, both on the personal and historical level. There's little real pain and suffering, no matter how horrible the historic event described was, and few really bad guys. If you want enjoyable, G-rated escape, these are your books."
3,Hercules: A Good Journey but Not An Excellent Legendary Journey,"Hercules The Legendary Journeys is a game that is based from the T.V. show. This game, not really. The game can be really fun at first but as you go on with the levels it gets way too hard. You may end up not knowing where to go and the bosses are too hard. This game is just too challenging. That's my main con of this game. The pros is that well, doing deeds once in a while is fine but not really. It real boring! It can get too hard it's not even fun. If I were you I would just stay away from this game. Too hard, too boring."
5,This Game Rules,My uncle works for EGM magazine and I got to play an early version of this. It reeked of awesomeness. It was a perfect mix of action and adventure.
3,Okay Mindlessness,"After the events in the surprisingly fun first movie, the green street boys find themselves in prison with their arch rivals Millwall. Now this depiction of prison is about as believable as an episode of Oz, but it is non stop action with fight after fight, with minor sub plots involving a crooked correctional guard. There aren't any twists and turns to the story and the ending you can see coming a mile away. If you like stupid action movies then this might be worth watching."
3,Implausible but decent,"This film was a little bit unrealistic, come on, a Soccer (excuse me.. ""Football"") game to determine who deserves freedom from an over crowded prison o_O?? Riiiiight LoL. Not anywhere near as good as the the first movie, But despite the implausible plot, I found my self cheering for the GSE Firm lads, and the violent action was decent, what you might expect in a prison movie. And how strange is it that an actor can play a totally different characters in a sequel? Actor/musician,Terrence Jay, who wrote the song 'One Blood' and plays the Harvard roommate Van Holden for the first movie, but then plays a prisoner named Jess Abbot in the sequel movie. Maybe the casting Directer figured no one would notice, and maybe a lot of people didn't, but i sure did LoL."
3,Green Street Hooligans 2 DVD,"This One Was Not as Good as The First But Hey What Sequel Usually is. Worth The Watch and The Price Was Right,Fast Shipping and it Was as Advertised."
3,available at home improvement stores,"these are available at home improvement stores (lowes, etc) for a couple of bucks each. no need to buy 10"
4,everything great,"Misia's powerful voice comes thru well on this album whether upbeat R&B pop or slow ballad. Truthfully, only liked around 5 songs or so but of those, the standout is the ballad ""Everything."" I may be stretching a bit, but this song could be a modern Melissa Manchester type ballad and, if I recall correctly, was used in commercials for Japan cell phone company, Docomo."
2,Hinge renders them almost useless,"Even though i love stainless steel containers and the container part of these canisters are sturdy - and are easy to wash and don't stain or keep odors - the hinge is so fragile it warped pretty soon after i bought them.I have 3 of these - 2 of the 4 cup canisters and 1 of the larger 6 cup canisters and ALL of them have a lid that no longer closes properly. At some point the metal hinge bent and so now the lid doesn't fit without a gap - so there no longer airtight. Just today i had some soup stored in the large one and as i took it out of the fridge, it spilled some on the floor because i must have not kept it fully vertical. It spills its contents very easily.I like the idea of these things, just the application is very poor and I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't spend any time actually testing them.I use the ones I have, but i would never buy any more even though i want to buy more stainless steel containers. You'll be disappointed if you buy these."
1,Not durable,"Not worth the price. Short life-span (months, not years). Look okay and no trouble with closure, but cannisters rust and mark countertops."
5,Christmas gift,This product turned out to be a great gift. I'm still hearing what a great gift it is. I would recommend this to anyone.
3,Slightly disappointed,"The functionality is great, as the seal is truly airtight. They are great looking on my counter. However, the ""clear"" acrylic lids on two of them are somewhat cloudy. It's almost like they were factory seconds."
2,Falls apart!!! Do not purchase.,"I have had these cannisters for four years since my wedding. They silicone rings began falling off less than three months after purchasing them, but I couldn't justify buying something new at the time. Over time, the cheap plastic lids have started cracking (They are just sitting on the counter in my kitchen and not stacked on each other or anything). I no longer feel like these are keeping my baking goods fresh--sugar clumps, brown sugar dry, etc. What a waste! If you want a permanant storage solution, this is not it...you're better off keeping your food in it's original packaging and using a ziplock bag...they seal better than these!"
2,Lids do not seal,"When these arrived, they looked nice. Once the tops were opened for the first time, it became clear that they were poor quality. The lids on all but one of the 4 containers were off to the side and when the latch was closed there were large gaps between the lid and the container due to the tops being off center. These are not airtight like the title implies. Maybe if you carefully guided the top down with one hand while you flipped the latch with the other hand you could get the top to line up until the latch is down. These are being sent back."
2,Pretty poor quality,"I bought these from a kitchen store and I'm pretty disappointed. They are a nice size for storing flour and sugar, but the pros end about there. The two smaller canisters are quite loose and don't seal at all- you can actually lift up the lid of the smallest one and create a visible gap. Not ideal to keep sugar fresh. Also, as at least one other reviewer noted, they are most certainly not stainless because there are flecks of rust all over them after not even a year (and they don't get wet)."
2,Cheap and lids don't seal well,"Nice container and very economical. It has silicone seals that keep the air out. However the lids shift side to side, and the seals shift from their original position, so it does not have a quality feel. Have to reposition the seals and maneuver the hinges so they work well."
4,Steel trasparent lid canisters,"Very good quality, fits the bill, only reason for 4 stars vs. 5 is that the lid to canister wire, is not on a par in quality with the rest of the product."
3,WARNING - OUTSIDE RUSTS OVERTIME,"I have had a set of these canisters for over a year. They are great for ease of access, seal well, and stack nicely; however, several of the canisters have rust spots. To be fair, I did not purchase the set from Amazon."
1,Don't buy these!,"These are the worst thing I have ever gotten from amazon. They don't close once opened once. The top will open but then the cheep rubber moves immediately and cannot be resealed even with quite a bit of tinkering. This happened the first time I opened each of the four canisters, not after using them even. The are made out of the cheapest of materials. Please don't waist your money."
2,"The ""look"" I wanted.....","I wasn't as impressed with these canisters as I had hoped, not for the price. They have the look I wanted, but not the quality I had hoped. They are very light and the top piece is cheap plastic. I have compared them to some I had almost purchased at Bed, Bath & Beyond. For the same price, I could've got heavy duty containers with glass tops. But they do seal well, so they perform their main purpose. Also, be careful when washing them (I recommend hand washing, I don't think they will withstand a dishwasher), the water kind of gets trapped between top piece and the rubber ring that seals the cannister. You have to dry really well or water will leak into the cannister.65% Satisfaction"
1,Cheap,"These look great, but are cheaply made. I already had to return these once because they were dented as soon as they were unpackaged! After use they fall apart! The silicone seal warped and fell off, which means that the canisters can't seal tightly. The plastic rim around the lid also cracked easily.Splurge a little and buy a better quality set!"
4,Man of Many Minds,"Man, I read this when I was young, and my original cheap paperback copy was falling apartand missing pages...Great to find one. Like an old friend I hadn't seen in decades.Great example of early sci-fi!"
4,As good as Hair of the Dog,"Why this wasn't released in the U.S. is beyond me. The unplugged version of This Flight Tonight and the orchestra version of Love Hurts alone are worth the price of the CD. After listening to this CD and No Jive, it makes me wish that Billy Rankin was still with the band. He penned most of the songs of these two albums and it definatly shows an improvment over anything Nazareth has released in the past ten years."
5,Move Me,"Great album, you really can't go wrong with Nazareth! I wouldn't hesitate to buy this album! Nazareth rocks, great band!"
2,NOT the Oscar Winner,Be certain - this is not the winner of the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film... it's a student production from University of Minnesota Law School.
1,West Bank Story,"West Bank Story presents- Relatively Talentless (T.O.R.T.) West Bank StoryWest Bank Story description is EXTREMELY misleading. The title would suggest that it is the ""West Bank Story"" 2006 Academy Award Winner as it is in the same location. Very confusing. What I received was in small print ""To Snap or not to snap."""
3,John Lennon works,The book was ok. It looks like it was actually made in the 1980s. But it does have the two Lennon books: In His Own Write and Spaniard in the Works...which makes the book good enough to have at least. Shipping was fast..item in good condition.
1,Book Purchase,"The initial book that I received from ""Cindy's Textbooks"" was the wrong version. I was sent the book that was for International use only. When I attempted to return this item Cindy's Textbooks was extremely difficult to deal with. She claimed that the book was returned damaged. I personally found this very difficult to believe. She claimed she would refund my purchase dollars less a $35 restocking fee. I had to deal directly with Amazon to receive my credit. I will never order from ""Cindy's Textbooks"" again and I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,Halloween delight,"Perfect for Halloween or year round for the Family. Kids loved it and were not scarred, just delighted. Would recommend"
4,Spooky fun for kids and tweens.,Formulaic but fun mix of comedy and thrills. The vampire cows are a hoot.
1,The Little Vampire-you just gotta see it!!,"The film is about a boy called Tony (Johnathan Lipnicky) who moves into this new place and starts having nightmares about vampires. Then one night while his parents are out, a vampire named Rudolph(Rollo Weeks) flys into Tony's bedroom. There, the two of then soon became the best of friends. Rudolph takes Tony to see his parents. Then later Rudolph and Tony goes on a long and frightening journey to find the amulet, which had been lost when the vampires were attacked by a vampire hunter, which is the source to save all the vampires from living an eternal life as vampires.My whole family went to see it and they all loved it. I'm sure many other people loved it too. All of my friends actually fancies Rollo! I don't believe it! They all say I'm just slow at maturing. How nice!!"
4,great kids movie,Very good - very light movie for children and adults who just want to enjoy a cute movie
5,A Great All-Family Movie,"The whole family will enjoy this flick, its a must have from the first bite to the flying cows!Easy to watch again and again.Ages 5-100 - a good clean fun movie."
4,As Much Fun As A Harry Potter Movie,"This is for sure a fun movie to watch and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It looks great and has some good special effects.All the actors did a very impressive job.Add the comedy and what's not to like? I love the first 3 Harry Potter movies,and think they are just such fun to watch.I feel the same way about The Little Vampire."
5,The Little Vampire with Jonathan Lipnicki,"I have seen this one on HBO, SHOWTIME, or THE MOVIE CHANNEL. I purchased this movie at BIG LOTS! for 3 dollars. It is a fun family movie. I don't think it is scary, meaning that vampires are usually a scary subject. Watching some of the documentaries about vampires and BLADE series with Wesley Snipes, can be put this subject into an adult area in my opinion. Death, killing, disintegrating to ashes."
5,I really love it!,"If you are trying to get started in riding a stationary bike, this is a great! I live in a rural area with windy, narrow roads I would never try to bicycle around here, so this is perfect. You feel like you are on an outdoor ride and it is just the right amount of challenging to get into shape. I am nearly 45 and I find it takes me back to my youth when I used to ride 30 miles at a time without breathing the car fumes. He talks and teaches you as you ride about conditioning for best calorie burn, fat burn, endurance, heart rate, etc... He was hurt while riding his bike and this is how he came up with this idea for indoor bicyclists. It helped him while he was getting over his injuries to ride a stationary bike thus the idea for the DVD's to simulate and outdoor ride. I am happy with this purchase!"
1,Read reviews first!,"With no search provision, no table of contents and no Bible, I was very disappointed with this download. Other people have expressed my expectations of a KJB with Naves topical study. I should have read their comments first. In fairness to all, the book was free."
1,Totally Agree With 1st Reviewer,"I got this free, thinking it was a Bible with a concordance. It is a book of scripture references, (you could call the concordance part), but it doesn't actually have a Bible in it. You can look up titles, & find some scripture references, but, you won't have an interactive Bible with it to search thru. I won't be keeping it!"
1,Nave's Study Bible: King James version w/ concordance,"When I got this book, it was because I wanted a concordance, but when I opened it up, it was really Nave's Topical Bible. I was very disappointed, but I thought well, okay, there might be times when I will want to study a topic, but there's no table of contents so you have to use the menu choices. It's not easy to get around in. Very disappointed. So I'm still looking for a concordance."
3,This is Nave's Topical Bible NOT Nave's Study Bible,"Whoa! This is what can happen when secular folks try scanning what they don't know.It looks like someone scanned the title page of Nave's Study Bible, laid it down, went to lunch, came back, picked up the wrong book, and started scanning again.The title page here says Nave's Study Bible, but the work actually scanned and offered here is Nave's Topical Bible, two entirely different books with two entirely different purposes ...And I have both hard cover's in my library.So, if you want Nave's STUDY Bible, this is NOT it (Would that it would be offered too, as one reviewer said).This is Nave's TOPICAL Bible which is similar to a Bible dictionary except that in this you look up a topic and, rather than an explanation, it gives you all the scripture references in the Bible related to that topic. A great work in itself."
2,Too Quick to Publish,"The nave's study bible is a great Bible study resource. Unfortunately, this Kindle edition was evidently converted from another electronic format, and the result is deplorable. The formatting is so atrocious as to almost make this edition all but useless."
1,The download is not the study bible. It is just the topical index.,"The download is not the study bible. It is just the topical index. Fix what you are displaying as the download, Amazon! Very disappointed."
5,Praise the LORD!,This was a download. Item is as described and there was no associated cost. I recommend this product and would use this vendor again.
3,Bible Concordance,I tried this on my kindle but I could't understand how to use it. Very confussing to get from on place to the other
3,Not easy to use,I downloaded this study bible to my kindle and am finding it very dificult to use. It might be easier as a paper book but not really designed well as an ebook
3,bad attempt to be like Strong's.,I feel this is a poor attempt to be like a Strong's dictionary. I tried finding my way around this book and gave up.
5,very good,I think this is one of their better albums and listen to this one often. Definitely a recommend if you want to sample something from Hiroshima or are already a fan.
2,Which way are you going?,"Some of your most recent CD's are getting confusing musically in which direction you want to go, especially this one. The koto is slowly missing on a lot of your songs. I do expect better. This current CD is so so."
1,WARNING - NO THEME MUSIC,"If you buy ANY item produced by Platinum, the theme song will be missing, especially from The Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and the Andy Griffith Show (and probably Green Acres). The theme music is replaced with some dumb replacement music. It seems that if the theme song has words, Platinum will replace it with their own dumb music. You have been warned!"
1,Unable to listen to it second bad disk,"I bought a M3 CD player and it can't play this. Second disk for the book, and it keeps saying that it is a bad disk, just like the first one."
2,Too much disco -- not enough Ruben Blades,"As Fania struggled to cross over to a wider (and whiter) audience, it seems as if they almost forgot about their salsa roots. Tracks like ""You Want It -- We Got It"" seem more appropriate on a disco compilation than a salsa album. Still, there are some strong moments here and Ruben Blades' Prepara represents salsa' greatest poet in his finest voice."
4,Ideal backpack,"This is a great backpack, has served me very well as a day pack, I use it a lot. It's not super bulky and is really well shaped to fit along my back. That said, the strap on the first one I bought broke the very first time I put it on... I sent it back for a refund, and got a new one, and I've been happy since. I've definitely given it reason for a bit of wear and tear in the last six months, but it has held up well."
2,It's ok,"I guess if you don't have any other books you can buy, get this one. But it will not tell you anything you already didn't know about nursing school."
4,WHAT A GREAT HELP TOOL,"I AM IN THE FIRST STAGE OF NURSING SCHOOL AND FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A TOTAL HELP TOOL. THIS BOOK IS VALUABLLE TO EVERY KIND OF NURSING STUDENT AND NEW GRADUATE. THIS BOOK TELLS YOU HOW TO CHOOSE A NURSING SCHOOL THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU, WHAT TO DO IF YOU BECOME SICK TO YOUR STOMACH,TIME MANAGEMENT,TEST TAKING SKILLS, STRESS MANAGEMENT, TIME MANGEMENT, ABOUT FINANCIAL AID, DIFFERENT TYPES OF NURSING DEGREES, ALL ABOUT THE NCLEX & HOW TO STUDY FOR IT AND HOW TO GET JOB INTERVIEWS, MAKE RESUMES AND JOB SEARCHES.THIS BOOK ALSO HAS A LOT OF LINKAGES TO INTERNET SITES WHICH ARE VERY HELPFUL. THE AURTHOR IS A NURSE AND HAS BEEN WHERE I AM AT AND HAS QUOTED ABOUT 300 OTHERS NURSES ON EACH AND EVERYTHING THAT CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO YOU ,PLUS IT IS EASY & FUN TO READ. THIS IS MONEY WELL SPENT. I FEEL 100% BETTER SINCE I HAVE READ THIS BOOK."
5,Why buy DVD?,"Yes, DVD. You may think it is a revolution but what is the point of having dvd if you havent got the right equipment. Well this says it all. The portable player not only acts as a video player but also a dvd-rom drive as well. with the optical data lead which can be purchased drastically converts the player into a fully working dvd-rom drive. what else this is portable so you can play dvd anywhere you want. Not only that but eith the optical lead you can download music onto a mini-disc so this is all portable! This is the most sexiest thing i have ever brought and surely it needs the love it wants."
1,Be prepared for headaches,"Bad support is putting it mildly. My battery died after a week but I was traveling so couldn't deal with it until about 5 weeks after purchase. Bad idea--there is a 4 week warrenty on the batteries and you cannot buy a replacement.The player (plugged into the wall) has problems playing some disks so I shipped it to Sharp's service partner as Sharp customer service (there's an oxymoron) instructed me. They just sent a bill for $180 labor (labor is only guaranteed for 3 months, and I was a couple of weeks beyond that). If I don't want to pay the $180, they want $70 just to ship it back.I can't think of a purchase I regret more than this one."
2,Terrible picture quality,"OK, I had purchased a 5 inch Panasonic about 8 months ago, and got used to the exceptional picture quality. BUT, so called upgrading to the Sharp DV-L70U, was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!The Panasonic 5 inch screens had almost 3D like pictures. It was amazing.BUT, The Sharp 7 inch player has a picture like a 1980's VHS cassette tape. HORRIBLE!!!!! ALSO, there is a annoying little red dot in the top of the screen, it will not go away!!!!!I'm not sure if it is just the Sharp 7 inch, or all 7 inch LCD's in general, but the 5 inch LCD is WAY BETTER.IN CONCLUSION:If you want to go for the picture quality, definately get the 5 inch.If you want to go for the bigger picture, maybe better viewing from long range, I would definately go for the 7 inch."
4,"Comparison of batteries: life, bloodloss, & Cost","I do agree that the sharp is a superior unit to the Sony, Pioneer, & Panasonic, though not by as much as most, but be aware that the battery life is definately shorter than the panasonic and pioneer.Even more annoying is how fast the Sharp's battery bleeds energy after about two hours, so it's almost pointless to carry more than one battery.I bought extra batteries direct for my Pioneer and my Sharp, and with S&H the Pioneer's came to 152.00 and the Sharp came to 310.00. That's right, two hundred and seventy-five dollars for a new battery.Lastly, the Sharp has a silly non-standard adapter plug, which makes third parties jobs very difficult; A serious ramifacation of this for frequent flyers is that xtend makes airplane power plugs for both the Panasonic and the Pioneer, but not the Sharp. Just something to think about."
3,Sharp DV-L70U Portable DVD - Too much $ to maintain.,"I purchased the Sharp DV-L70U Portable DVD and received it quickly. When I received it the first thing I noticed was the cable that comes out the back of the battery and goes in the side of the player, very inconvenient, make the player about 1/2 inch wider. Other units have the battery slide into place and connects without cables. Picture quality is great, sound is great, Unit looks nice but the worse thing was it has a 3 1/2 battery and I wanted to purchase an extra battery and they are $ 359.00 and you can only get them from Sharp. Other manufacturer's batteries range from $ 129.00 to $ 179.00. I explained that to Sharp but they were not sympathetic or willing to work with me. I RETURNED THE UNIT IMMEDIATELY AND PURCHASED THE PANASONIC 7"". I AM VERY HAPPY. Extra battery for the Panasonic is $ 129.00 and is a 4 hour battery."
4,A funny and exciting book.,"This is definitely a childrens book. It would put an adult to sleep. It is a very funny children's book though. The jokes aren't exacty that funny. I tried the funniest one on my dad and he kinda said, ""Was that supposed to be funny or what?"" It was sort of embarassing. I would recommend this book to any one who likes to laugh and is able to get their nose out of a good book."
3,The Disgusting Story,"The book is called Marijuana and your lungs. Debbie Stanley wrote this non-fiction story. This story is about the problems of smoking an illegal drug.Smoking is not a good thing it does things like causing high blood pressure, which could lead to a stroke or a heart attack. ""Sometimes your pot is laced with other drugs causing very bad reactions."" Most people say marijuana is safe, but we all the truth about that one. I learned that smoking could cause lung cancer and emphysema.This book should make the people who do it think twice about the decision they are about to make. I don't know why people continue to do it when their chance of living a better life awaits. They even know the problems and risks about doing it but they still do it.After you read this book you will actually think if you should do it or not, hopefully this book taught you something. So that if someone ever asks you to do it then you tell him or her no that you are proud to be drug free."
4,3 yr old delight!,"My son loved this book. The fragrances were very vivid and really smelled like, toothpaste, banana, cheese, etc. The larger size of this book was good and lift the flap features were a plus. Very enjoyable, even more than a year later."
2,A bit disappointing,The Nokia Bh-900 is a bit disappointing. Loses connection at a very short distance ( 8-10 feet).
4,Very classy and stable....,This is my second bluetooth headphone in the last couple of weeks. This one is very stable on your ear. You can even jog with this ON. I tried few others but each and everyone hurts the ear after an hour of usage even this one. So I guess this could not be counted as a bad point. Overall it is very classy. I have not came across the issues mentioned by other ppl. So far I had this for the last three days and used it for more than 8 hours and did not observe any problem with it.
2,Not as great as some would say...,"I purchased this unit after reading how clear the transmission quality was; several had said that those being called couldn't tell when they were using their headset, or speaking directly into their phone.While the voice quality is good, I had problems with the following: 1) Volume on the headset doesn't go up as high as I would like, 2) Doesn't hold a charge for at least 8 hours, and doesn't tell you, and 3) (and this is the most aggravating) for some reason I regularly go to answer a call and get a message that there is a weak signal between the headset and my phone. For cryin' out loud...their only 24"" away from each other!! I have to carry my phone in my chest pocket, and even then it sometimes won't work.Keep looking...this isn't the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
5,"Just awesome, finally I found the bluetooth headset of my type","Before buying the Nokia BH-900 Bluetooth headset, I had done lot of research. I had reviewed the headsets from different companies also tested some of the cheaper ones. But, I am a big Nokia fan. I have always used the wireless phones and accesories from Nokia. And this product strengthened my belief in Nokia products. It is very sleek, convenient and has excellent sound quality. You can talk for hours. The important thing is that its totally worth to spend money (its little bit expensive than other products) on this product. Don't worry just order this product and you will have more fun in using your cell phone."
2,"Nice Headset, But beware of compatiblity",I bought this blue tooth headset because I read good reviews. When I received it and tried it out I had issues with my LG VX8300 cell phone. I called Nokia support and was told Nokia could only guarantee 100% compatibility with Nokia phones and could do nothing for me. I sent it back for a refund. I just wish the blue tooth manufacturers would let people know about which phones are or are not compatible with their products.
1,Expensive and doesn't fit well,"This headset looks good on paper, but unlike most other Bluetooth units, it does not have a speaker that protrudes into your ear from the headset. I found myself doing everything possible to hear people and get the speaker closer to my ear. If I turned the volume up as high as it goes, I just about heard the person on the other end. Most of the time I would grab it off my ear and just use the phone speaker.On the plus side, it's nicely designed and simple to use. Just don't expect to feel that it's working while you're wearing it.After a week of fiddling, this ones going right back to Amazon. I'll gladly eat the shipping."
2,terrible battery life,"This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone. The sound quality is as good as other headsets I've used, and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer. However, I'm VERY disappointed with how poor the battery life has been. I get less than 1 hour of talk time and less than 48 hours of standby time. I could go over a week with my old Nokia bluetooth headset."
3,Birthday gift returned.,I was given this as a Birthday gift. It's very stylish but did not suit my needs and was returned.Pros:1. Decent (incoming) sound quality.2. Attractive looking3. Full sync with the Nokia phone4. Comfortable Fit:Cons1. People complained it was difficult to hear me2. Awkward to attach to ear3. Background noise seemed almost amplified.4. Could not shut off indicator light.
4,Great for Nokia Phone and Dragon Naturally Speaking,"I bought this headset because it's certified for Dragon Naturally Speaking. It's the clearest headset I ever used, and works great with a Nokia phone. Also, convenient because it uses the same simple charger plug as my Nokia cell phone, so there is no need for a cradle or anyting.Watch the price, it fluctuates on Amazon between $65 and $85 depending on how many they have left at any time."
4,Best sounding headset!,"Have tried quite a few different bluetooth headsets. Very impressed with the BH-900 audio quality. People can't tell that I am using a headset as the audio quality is excellent with no audio artifacts/noise. Very secure holding on your ear. I use this with a Nokia E61, Motorola RAZR, WindowsXP.Only reason for giving it a 4 instead of 5 is:- rather expensive- slightly uncomfortable after long periods of use"
4,The Headset,"The BH900 works great with the Nokia e90 phone. It provides clear audio quality and allows clear voice dialing. However, the standby time is not what is listed. I get 48 hours of standby and about 8 hours of talk.The boom is the best feature. Even in 40 mph winds, people have reported hearing me clearly and with little to no wind noise."
2,"Too big, awkward and low battery life.","A friend recently supplied me with a couple of bluetooth headsets to try out to see if I liked them. This model was too long, big, and awkward to put on my ear. Most earpieces are much smaller these days. Plus, I wasn't sure about the slide out mic feature. Did I need to use it?Also, the specs indicate that it has 180 hours of standby battery life. I fully charged the headset and left it on overnight. By the next day the battery was dead. Fibbers..."
4,"Great sound, less than 100% connectivity",The sound quality is excellent and the people I talk to say they hear me as well as if i spoke directly into my Razor V3. Occasionally when i press the answer button on the headset it will connect but i hear no sound and the phone will display the bluetooth is weak message even though it is a foot away from the headset. My Motorola headset did this as well but not as often. This is very annoying.
1,Do not buy,I have worn tons of headsets and was excited by the wear style and ability to use PTT with this one. But the fit was horribly loose sound quality was terrible
4,"Durable headset, great quality","I have had several headsets, and this one has lastest longer than any of them. It holds a charge for a long time, whereas the other ones would die sooner.Good sound quality, comfortable fit. Although the microphone extends as a boom, I never use it extended. The quality and comfort are just fine without it extended."
4,Clarity,"Best headset I have ever used. Even in a fairly noisy car, the noise cancellation makes it crystal clear. Battery out-lasts my phone."
5,A Real Gem,Soren Kirkegaard can be difficult to understand. This book presents Kirkegaard's writings in their essense in a way that is easy to read and comprehend. This book can be used as a devotional due to the format.
3,pretty darn good,"Yes, it was a silly romance novel, but it was very interesting historically and the most of the characters were realistic, except for the one who went to war and lost his arm, I don't remember his name. I thought it was a good book."
1,kiwi,"This author has written a couple of books about Australia. Her research is inept. She creates highly improbable/impossible situations and her rationale is weak. I don't know how her editor could let her get away with something so incredulus. As an example--""they landed the plane on top a hill in pouring rain some twelve miles from the station (ranch) house then removing their shoes (great idea) walked twelve miles through mud and scrub, crossed a fast moving flooded river, picked up a sick baby which was carried in a sling through the same pouring rain and walked back the same twelve miles to the plane-twenty four miles in six hours. She's a great surgeon too. Who else could repair an aorta in the chest cut by a bullet while a couple of ranch hands ""held back the bones"" and on the ranch house floor too."
1,If you have been living in a cave for the past 6 years,"Professor Bark has made the mistaken assumption that what he discovered is news to other people. I suppose his target audience are technophobics who have had no exposure to the internet. This book may have had significance 4 years ago, but not today."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my 11 year-old nephew for Christmas. One afternoon we decided to do some of the experiments and found that a majority of them needed additional materials such as food coloring and extra bottles. Food coloring is needed for so many projects that it should have been provided. Aside from that, many of the experiments did not work. We had a nice time trying, but we ended up disappointed since we expected a lot of them to work. Sorry, but I would not recommend this product."
1,bottle brings down pop bottle science,This is a great idea but doesn't really work. The large pop bottle is split for creating terrariums etc. and appears to seal with an interlocking system. It actually doesn't seal and so the majority of experiments which involve water or an air tight container - fail miserably! Water pours out from the seam of the bottle and gas escapes.The book that is included is well done and the other equipment is fine. We ended up scrapping the bottle and using our own.
3,Be sure a book is the right gift..,"This came as a book, not in a soda bottle. I thought it might have more supplies, but it was just the book. I was hoping fun packaging would interest my little brother, but he just eyed the book with a ""seriously""? kind of look. Some of the experiments sound neat. Probably the right gift for some kid.. Didnt work for mine."
1,Waste of Time!,"The two other reviews must be for other movies, as this one comes nowhere near anything they are talking about. The main character is deaf and mute so 90% of the movie lacks dialogue. I understand the era in which this movie comes from, but there is still no excuse for this film. I actually feel bad for the 1hr 30 minutes of my life I lost to this boring production. Stay away, far,far away."
4,useful and thorough,"I took a chance with this- on the strength of the description. I had a real need for just such a volume as a Photographer, Art teacher and Buddhist.I wasnt disappointed. The work is scholarly but not difficult and it manages to be useful and readable throughout. Collections of writings on Aesthetics can often present problems. Not this one. If your interests lie in Art and Culture in Asia, then you may find this volume a handy compilation."
2,not much to listen too,"i was pretty disapointed with this compilation. very few songs worth listening too. the eggs and a few Walleye songs are about the only ones i could stand for more than a few minutes on this album. i realized why none of these bands besides the ones mentioned had any ripple in the indie scene, none had any melody or original instrumental ideas at all."
5,Very nice shoe,I bought this for my brother for Christmas. When i seen it I wanted to keep it because it looks nice and classy. Very Shiny shoe. He's going to love it!!!
3,OK,"The tip of the shoe is too wide, so it looks a bit too informal. Other than this, the shoe is good."
4,Kenneth Cole Reaction Sim-Plicity,"Nice looking, attractive square-toe shoe. Squareness of toe not exaggerated. True to length, width and instep. Although shoe was a bit snug initially, it was quick to break-in for comfort (about two wears). This is my second pair. Previously bought a brown pair."
4,Nice smooth shoes,Very sharp shoes. I've had this and another pair for almost two years now. I just keep them clean and they look fine. Great buy.
4,Awesome styling; comfortable; longevity quesionable,"The pictures on the product page can't quite capture then depth of color of these shoes. Lots of shades of browns, and the color really comes out outdoors in natural lighting. In terms of comfort, these are among the best of my dress shoes with the ""fashion comfort technology"" insoles. Provides arch and heel support right where you need it most. As for durability/longevity, we'll have to see. I've only had the shoes a few weeks now, probably only worn them less than 10 days, and already they're pretty badly ""creased"" in the flex points and have lost that new-shoe look. Maybe it's just the initial break-in and they won't get much worse from here out? Time will tell I guess. But overall very pleased with them."
1,Kenneth Cole REACTION Men's Sim-Plicity Oxford,"Very disappointed, very hard leather, shinny look ok for a prep school teen but not for me. I own several pairs of Kenneth Cole shoes and this is the first time that I had to return because that was no way I could wear it. On the plus side, Amazon price and shipping time always the best..."
5,Well made shoes,"Considering that these are formal dress shoes, its stiffness is a good thing, because no wrinkles will appear easily. I felt they were too stiff and too tight the very first time I wore them but, after the first full day I use these shoes, they are as comfortable as my other dress shoes. No blisters, no need of double socks, no harsh contact of any kind. They have a moderate modern look and a high gloss that make them impressive, the different brown shades also make them look ""special"". Great deal at $50."
1,Not Real Leather!,"Website description says leather. When you actually get the shoes, you will notice on the tongue they clearly state man made upper. For $70+, these are a rip-off. I can get fake leather shoes that look almost identical to these and are about the same quality for $30 at any of those shoe warehouse type stores. Returned immediately."
1,Fugly Shoe,"This shoe is so ugly i bought it without looking at top view, the look like Bozos shoes when you are walking, the sole is horrendous, makes too much sound and the back of my foot is destroyed. You have been warned."
3,"Kenneth Cole Reaction Men's Sim-plicity, Oxford, Black.",The shoe size runs small I bought a 9.5 my normal size but it's very tight. The way this shoe fits I should of bought a 10.
3,Work well,Work well with jeans and a casual sport shirt un-tucked. The rubber sole is perfect for the messy weather we frequently get in northern OH............it keeps your foot warm and dry since it doesn't absorb the moisture like a leather sole shoe does.
1,the worse thing I've bouth,"I am using these shoes for 2 months and its quality is quite bad, I've never bought shoes so bad, look like cardboard, so little time they have used seem to take positions for longer than 1 year, I don't recommend this product cause they are really bad, I hope the store or brand to respond but definitely I will not buy Kenneth Cole again"
1,Squeaky!,"I purchased these shoes and they squeaked so loudly, I had to return them. They are not of any minimum quality. Very disappointed."
2,Shoe shipped to me with two different size,"Shoe shipped to me with two different size,one is 8 and another is 9.I have received refund yr corp released.I'm very satisfied with your reply."
1,super bad quality,"i weared it once and craked on me, super cheap quality and made me look fool at the partydont recommend it to any one, i also didnt get a refund yet, which im going to contact my credit card for this"
2,"Beautiful, but not comfortable","These shoes are beautiful and elegant, but quite hard on the ankle. Not comfortable at all, contrary to all other Kenneth Cole shoes I had."
1,tore my feet up after one day,"I have owned many Kenneth Cole shoes in the past and these are by far the worst shoes i have ever owned. The fit of these shoes will leave your feet blistered and in pain, don't waste your money on these shoes."
1,Disappointing,The quality of these shoes is very disappointing. I have had a few pairs of different Kenneth Cole REACTION's over the years and they just don't hold up well -- and I work in an office all day. And when I contacted customer service they were very unsympathetic. For the price I expected much better quality. Don't waste your money on any Kenneth Cole shoes.
2,Uncomfortable and fake plastic looking,"I got lucky with a pair of clearance Kenneth Cole New York shoes from another online store a few weeks ago, and these shoes looked really nice, too, so I thought I'd take advantage of the markdown ($35.99). I needed another pair of dress oxfords for work.Unfortunately they have that cheap, fake plastic look to them. Maybe these are OK for a high schooler dressing up for prom, but not for a business environment. Even worse, they dug into the tops of my ankles when I tried to walk in them.Maybe I am one of the few nay-sayers, because people really seem to love these on zappos, but I would recommend something else."
1,Terrible quality,The shoes literally fell apart. First it was the glued-on leather part on the heel. I repaired that and a few days later the whole sole of both shoes just fell off. I only got to wear these shoes maybe 6 or 7 times before they fell apart and I was inside for most of the time I wore them. I don't feel it is even worth it having them repaired and I am never buying another pair of Kenneth Cole shoes in my life. I've owned shoes of innumerable brands and have never before seen a product this poorly built.
4,Reinterpreting 101,"Exhausted with old time rock and rollers spelunking `Pop Standards' for the sake of thriving their long-lost careers [see Rod Stewart, Michael McDonald, etc...] Brazilian legend Veloso's sonic, wearing-thin velvet gift `reinterprets' [where Stewart `rehashes' and Michael McDonald's 'Motown' 'trashes'], allowing the inherent loveliness into these American standards, singing rings around his contemporaries. He redeems `Feelings', compliments and complements Kurt Cobain, reinvigorating Dylan & Stevie Wonder and even Cole Porter. And by same-sexing `The Man I Love', the hetero Veloso brings dignity and understanding across musical cultures in one song than any gay minstrel could hope. My grade: A-"
2,Where's the soul?,"I'm a big fan of Caetano Veloso, but having heard these songs on the radio and in live performance, I am disappointed. The interpretations of these songs -- which have been described repeatedly by the artist in terms of ""irony"" -- are not worthy of his great, great talent. Irony is cheap; this sublime artist has much more to offer. Maybe the whole exercise is just too subtle for me, but when I listen to Caetano Veloso, I expect to be thrilled to my soul, and the thrill is not here. I'll wait, eagerly and hopefully, for his next creative venture."
1,Must Have Seemed a Good Idea at the Time,"Judging from many of the other reviews, a lot of people like this album. I'm not sure just what the point of this odd CD is, though. The song selection is sometimes eccentric in the extreme, many of the vocals sound contrived at best (""It's Alright, Ma,"" for example), and has any fan of Brazilian music ever awakened in the morning and thought, ""Gee, I wish Caetano Veloso would sing 'Feelings' on his next CD.""? Veloso is unquestionably a great artist, but this CD seems more like a vanity project, than a entertaining exploration of English-language pop music. If you are still tempted to buy it, be sure you listen to it first."
1,"The ""emperor"" has no clothes!","Caetano Veloso hit an artistic peak and is going downhill pretty darned fast, if this album is anything to go by.The musicianship on this disc is excellent, but it's a very poor effort in comparison with say, Livros, Fina Estampa (studio and live) Circulado & Circulado Vivo, Uns and many, many more.Don't waste your bucks on this one; it simply isn't worth it. Most Brazilians who like Caetano can't stand this album, and with good reason - it's pathetically bad. (I know these are strong words, but euphemisms and qualifiers aren't called for in this case.)"
5,Simply Caetano,"Caetano Veloso is a Midas of music. Who else could re-invent the Band that re-invented rock'n roll? Listen carefully to Come as You Are, If It's magic, and Cry me a River. The definite versions for some of the most beautiful american standards are now Cae's. Too bad for Rod Stewart."
3,bloody war in elfland,This is a Sword and Sorcery sequence of five books (the second) with the Star Wars twist that the most evil wizard is the hero's father.This one reminds one very much of the J. R. R. Tolkien's Rings trilogy type of sequence with the dwarfs being Hobbit-like and the walking ancient trees.It is just a little too much war from start to end for my taste.Pretty well written: actually better than another sequence I have read by the same author. Sequences like this seem to be written more with the idea of selling a lot of books to fantasy lovers than any literary end?
2,Great Book.......not so great ending,I finished this book a few days ago. I loved it except for the ending. I almost hated the ending. In fact the ending was so bad that I almost didin't start to read Night Masks. I am glad I did read it tough. I could tolerate a terrible eding like this because I knew there were 3 more books. Well Bye. and do read this book
2,Won't stay closed,"The snap on this handcuff case won't stay closed. As such, i've lost my cuffs twice while running to stat calls."
3,Spacey is exceptional as always,The whole film is a drag. It is more like a montage of the Hollywood scene. It does pull things together towards the end but sadly half the viewers would have probably left and missed it. Keke Palmer is promising and Kevin Spacey is in his usual best.
5,compelling and inspiring,"i can watch this film over and over and over again and never get sick of it. compelling story! very true to life, witty, and an incredible masterpiece.."
4,"Who is the craziest, the shrink or his patients?","Although the rhytm in this movie is somewhat uneven and disconnected the film is worth while seeing, especially thanks to the performance by Kevin Spacey, he is a great and versatile actor.Berit."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The actors are good but the script doesn't allow them to do much. Like many viewers have already stated, the plot is shallow and you see everything coming including the ending. It's just a movie for the brain dead. I would actually give it two stars, but the overall score is too high. Many more one star reviews are needed to bring the rating down to where it should be."
5,Spacey,"As always Kevin Spacey never fails to deliver. Many layers to this movie, makes it an interesting journey for the viewer. Its not your typical movie where everything is spoon fed to you. You're able to think and feel a little for yourself. I see other reviewers 'caning' it, but I for one thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
1,A tedious exercise in predictability and misogyny,"Yay, another movie that's based on long loving shots of women being tortured and murdered. Where's the suspense? The movie substitutes gore for plot, predictability for originality, and has no surprises to offer. Big whoop. There was no plot to speak of, it was boring and sadistic, and the ending was no surprise. Sheesh. That's ninety minutes of my life I wasted.I wish I could give this negative stars."
3,I just haven't needed to refer to it after class,"This was a required text book for a graduate level class. I kept the book, as I do all textbooks and I have actually referred to this one in practicing speech language pathology."
5,Amazing book--a must read for all Moms,"This book hit home. One of my best friends gifted me with this book and it has been one of the best gifts ever. I work full time and have a 10 month old daughter. After reading just a chapter I felt relieved to know I am not the only one feeling stressed with all there is to do everyday while maintaining a home, work, relationships,etc. This book gives permission to slow down, and it says it's okay to stop and listen and not do the big birthday parties and attend all the holiday parties and events. Just being and listening and not doing anything together is time well spent."
5,Great book for all parents!,"This book is a refreshing look at how we can help our children (and ourselves!) by slowing the pace of their lives and ours and taking time to just enjoy each other. For those who may be thinking it is a ""religious"" book, you should know that the author admits in the book that her family has not been one to regularly attend church...and yet the book is about the ""spirituality"" of being a parent and filling the needs of the family. Anyone who is or ever will be a parent should read this book."
5,We could all use something in this book,"What wonderful advice for slowing down, re-evaluating, prioritizing and appreciating every day life. She does a good job of not being self-righteous or preachy, but sharing what has worked well for her family, and what she has learned from and is passing to us. I'd highly recommend it for any parent."
2,Smug and self-righteous,"Obviously many readers have found this book inspiring. I'm not one of them -- I found the tone smug and self-righteous. I nearly gagged when she made her son throw away all his toy guns after the Columbine shootings -- and he meekly went along with her. I'm not accusing her of making it up; it's just hard for me to identify with a mother whose children are so extraordinarily accommodating.Kenison is a good writer, but she'd be a whole lot better if she had the tiniest hint of a sense of humor, especially about herself and her family."
1,horrible transfer,This dvd looks as if it was copied from a hand held camera at a theater. I will never buy a dvd from this company(Westlake Entertainment Group) again. I lost my receipt or I would demand my money back.
1,Would not work,"I ordered this, it would not work. A second one was sent out andit would not work either."
2,For UFO film fanatics only,"This movie is slow-going but is interesting if you're a serious fan of UFO films. This film is much less about a UFO that is sighted by a few pilots than it is about the government's process for shutting up the pilots. After the pilots report having seen radar blips moving strangely and the disappearance of one of their planes, they are locked in a secret facility for 18 hours where government agents mess with their heads and try to get them to say that nothing out-of-the-ordinary happened."
1,The Disappearance of Flight 412,This movie is not what I thought it would be. I really thought it would be a plane disaster movie. Boy was I wrong. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I know it is based on a true story but get real it was awful.
1,Big Disappointment,"I was utterly disappointed about this movie and turned it off 23 minutes into it. As mentioned, the visual and audio quality is horrible, but on top of that the cover picture of a commercial airliner leads customers to believe this is a disaster movie about a commercial jet airliner going down with a couple of hundred passengers on board, and the rescue and investigation efforts after the event, instead, this is a military film with no suspense build-up whatsoever. So in addition of the misleading cover picture (""false advertisement?""), this movie is beyond boring - it's a waste of money and resources."
4,Sweden by way of Texas,"Texas has always had a rich history in underground music. In the early '80s, when hardcore punk ruled, there was D.R.I. and MDC. Fast forward 10 years later to death metal's reign, and there were really good unsigned acts such as Magus and Embalmed.Shift to the town of Plano and you had Divine Eve, who went against the grain of what was coming out of America at the time and seemed to prefer to emulate the sounds of the Sunlight Swedish bands such as Entombed and Dismember.This EP is actually a demo that was recorded in October of 1992 and then picked up for major release by Nuclear Blast in 1993. I can see why the label snapped the previously unsigned band up, as this is some quality Swedeath with still a hint of American influence riffing-wise.Maybe not quite up to the level of the originators of the sound, but Divine Eve proved that the trademark Swedish buzzsaw guitar and bass sound could be done almost as well by an American band. Good stuff."
2,Soft Core Porn,"This movie is great, if your looking for a soft core porn rather than an enjoyable horror film. I love over the top horror films to just sit back and laugh at, but this movie was horrible! Sure it had a couple lines in it that were pretty funny mostly because of the terrible acting, but for the most part the jokes were lame, the killings were boring, and since I was wanting to watch a horror film and not a porn the 3/4 of the movie where they just strip, dance and rub each other got old. Not recommended unless your just looking for an hour of boobs."
2,Hot blood sundae and Ice scream,"The origional movie was called Ice Scream and it came out long before this one. Exact same plot, same charactors, only the origional had Conrad Brooks in it. I wonder why that one is not on dvd. I wonder why the total rip off?"
4,Great Cord & Outlet Organization,"I purchased 2 of these 10-Outlet Surge Protectors.I had outgrown my computer surge protector because I had problems with space for the numerous power adapter plugs.This unit has allowed me to connect all the regular plugs and larger power adapter plugs into one unit.The second one will be used in my garage once I figure out how to mount on a wall.The one drawback to this unit is that it is not made for wall mounting, so I will have to ""ad-lib"" to mount the one in the garage (which should not be a major problem."
5,Great book for working with your preschooler!,"This is a fun Preschool workbook with lots of pictures and bright colors. It covers the alphabet and the letter sounds, shapes, colors, making associations, patterns, sequences, and much more! The pages are perforated so you can take them out without ripping the book apart. Includes an answer key. The Muppets characters feature throughout the book. Fun and educational!"
4,Don't let the title fool you,"This was my first bite into the words of Harrison, and I quickly bought three more of his afterwards. Wolf is not so much about Harrison's hero searching for the beast, but of him searching to find himself in the reality he has thrown himself into over the years. Drying himself off of bourbon and physical and mental loves over the years, while reminiscing over his well travelled youth. With humor and words that are true to the way we speak and think. Sometimes he'll ramble in newfound dreams while walking alone through the woods, where it's hard to follow, but its interesting to see inside his mind during these times. We truly follow his train of thought, which is important in understanding and relating to the man. Harrison's world lives in all of us..."
4,A great first novel by an American icon.,"Harrison's first novel is a great book. It shadows the irrevrant character of the novelist himself. From the purpose of the trip [to see wolves] to the final gorging of food in Ishpeming, Harrison takes one on a roller coaster of emotions all bundled up in the persona of a modern man trapped in a world he doesn't understand and that has long foresaken him. Wolf is a must read for Harrrison fans."
3,Disappointed,"This was my first attempt at Harrison, and I left it disappointed. Judging from some of the reviews of others, and from Harrison's overall fame and success, perhaps his other works deserve a try. I may be being unfair to the author, but I felt like maybe Harrison was trying to hard to write like, well, Harrison. I found this book (more specifically, it's protagonist) to be unnecessarily dark, depressed, and a bit depraved. If you cannot get enough of Harrison, then you should probably read it. If you are just curious, I'd suggest one of his more popular books."
2,Disappointing,"I too read this book and was deeply disappointed. A rambling story with no real satisfaction reached by the reader at the end. I rank this book right up there with ""Farmer"" and ""A good day to die"" as being one of Jim's lessor works."
4,Two stories,Mackenzie's Pleasure (4 stars): Zane protects Barrie. I still don't really understand why he left the Seals though.A Game of Chance (3 stars): Chance sets up Sunny. He should be kicked.Overall the Mackenzie series is well worth reading. Ms. Howard does have a knack for romance.
4,Linda's good as usual,I love stories that flow into each other - this really does it. Linda Howard knows how to keep true to old characters while bringing you along into new wonderful characters. She sizzles!
4,Watch out for Nikon's Technical Support - Windows XP Issues,"This is a great scanner - but first time buyers of such a scanner, with Windows XP as an operating system beware! If you purchase the scanner, be sure that the package contains the Installation CD that contains the Windows XP installation update. Many of the inventoried Scanners do not have the update and to trying to get an update is an exercise. You have to download it from the website, but you must first call Nikon support to get this information. The hold times for the support line can take more than an hour. Then, best of luck on the download. After spending 4 hours on the thing myself, I finally had to call Nikon back, wait on hold for an hour and 15 minutes to then learn I had to call someone else to get them to mail me a disk. Hopefully, this tip can save you hours!"
4,Great scanner with excellent results!,I've owned this scanner since December 99 and it has been used almost daily without fail. The results are good and ICE is a must have feature.I've a fuller review with sample scans and more at: http://www.webaperture.com/articles/
4,Great scanner for it's time,"This was a great scanner for it's time. It does a good job of scanning slides (haven't used it much for negative scanning). The Color Management System doesn't do the job I wish it did, often the colors are darker than the slide, so I usually adjust them in Photoshop. The shadows can be dark as well.Overall, it's a good scanner, especially if you're only doing small-print or web work. Nikon now has newer scanner models with greater o/p and bit depth.The question to ask yourself is ""What am I going to do with the images I scan? Produce small prints or put them on the web?"" If so, this scanner is perfect. If you're a semi-pro or pro who wants as much detail as possible, then get a newer model (ie: 4000 ED).....which will most likely be my next purchase. :)"
5,Five Star Winner!,"""Coyote Songs"" is one of the best non-fiction books out there. Ron Marr has a unique style that can make you laugh, cry & think about what's really important in life. One of my favorite quotes in the ""Love & War"" chapter is ""Love means never having to say you're sorry for being yourself."" Another great line in the ""Greener Grass"" chapter is ""I want to fly without wings or chains, discover what's really inside a Twinkie, have 47,563 pen pals, run for king of nothing & maybe just write one bestseller."" I think Ron has written a bestseller; & I wish & hope he writes many more."
5,This movie is great!,"A great chase movie, Reynolds and DeLuise make a great combo. The cars in this flick are nasty fast, and the 2 chicks in the Lamborghini Countach make the movie...especially the opening chase scene."
3,Hilarious & Horrible all in the same movie,"From a comedy standpoint, Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, SammyDavis Jr. and Dean Martin are incredible. From the same perspective Farrah Fawcett and the whole ""AJ Foyt"" aspect are horrible. Definitely a cult classic however!!"
3,Cannonball Run,"Okay, so I first saw this film at the age of 10, and we all know that a 10 year old is easier to please than an adult. However, I still love this film now (15 years later!), and not just for the fast cars and all-star cast. Of course the plot is almost non-existent but who cares? It's refreshing to see a film which doesn't take itself too seriously (a point that Dr Popinofsky seems to have missed in his review). It's called fun, Doc. F-U-N. If we're not allowed a bit of pointless fun from time to time what's the point of even getting out of bed in the morning?I accept it's probably not to everybody's taste but it still makes me giggle!"
5,Great Movie & A Great Price,"I must admit that my expectations were not too high on purchasing this Blu-ray, but I'm glad I was wrong. The movie itself needs no real explanation, tons of stars (a little too much Burt Reynolds for my taste, though), fighting (Jackie Chan's first Hollywood movie) and fast cars add up to some great entertainment. Picture quality is very good considering the price and the disc even manages to squeeze in a commentary. The highlight has to be the out-takes displayed during the credits, so funny!If you want a movie that doesn't require too many brain cells, this is the one for you. Just plain fun"
4,I can't drive 55,"Fun group road picture based on Brock YatesCannonball!: World's Greatest Outlaw Road Raceabout an odd collection of characters to race accross the country.Roger Moore, Jamie Farr, Farrah, Burt Reynolds, Dom Delouis, Jackie Chan, Peter Fonda, Burt Convey, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Tillis all with their own special verhicles and Andrian Barbo with a Lamborghini Countach. Fun and Funny. The out takes at the end are equally funny."
1,"this ""cannonball"" is a dud","""you'll never guess who wins"" the tag line says but really you won't care because this film is a mess. the best part is the out takes at the end. even though it made a ton of money it is just not funny. for fans of car crashes and burt fans only"
3,Good romp,Somewhat amusing. Best thing about the movie were the two women in the Lambourghini with the tight outfits.
1,Even the writer Brock Yates distanced himself from this movie.,"Brock Yates, the originator of the actual Cannonball Run Race and writer of Cannonball Run movie even distanced himself from it when he realized during the filming that it was becoming a fictional Friends of Burt comedy movie. He mentions this in his book about the history of the Cannon Ball Run. The only movie worse is the Cannonball Run II.A more realistic movie about cross country racing is The Gumball Rally."
3,"Great mindless fun, but five stars? Give me a break.","This is a funny, sophomoric thrill that still works after all these years. But five stars? I don't think so."
1,This movie should come with a surgeon general warning,"This movie may cause death from severe boredom and/or depression at the knowledge that you PAID money for it. It is SO bad that I actually threw it out rather than resell it, in doing so I saved some innocent person from having this inflicted upon them. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Stupid.,"Viewed: 1/06Rate: 21/06: The Cannonball Run seems to promise entertainment due to its all-star cast but ends up boring the daylights out of me. There were too many pointless scenes happening, and it was hard to like about The Cannonball Run. I'll admit, that doctor did crack me up. But as far as the rest of the film goes, it's all stupid. Three thousand miles to be covered in thirty-two hours? Probable...yes, but it requires a lot of planning, luck, and straight driving. Of course, the film The Cannonball Run makes it too easy for everybody to make it on time although it becomes predictably a footrace to end the race. I wished the rules of the race were explained more clearly so I could grasp the outline and the purpose of the race and the rewards thereafter the finish, but The Cannonball Run would rather focus on the tits of Farrah Fawcett (which isn't saying much for me) than bother with the muckety-muck of the race. All in all, The Cannonball Run is a terrifically bad dud."
1,All stars equals one star,"Burt Reynolds was the biggest movie star in the world when (1980) he made CANNONBALL RUN. Did he appear in this bomb to test his fans' patience? Did he really think the script was humorous or exciting? Maybe the filmmakers spent so much time recruiting CANNONBALL RUN's all-star cast that they forgot to write jokes or develop any story. Except for Dom Deluise's very funny performance, the only laughs are at the paying audience's expense. Burt Reynolds redeemed himself with the appropriately titled STARTING OVER once the stench of CANNONBALL RUN died down."
1,Can you have less than one star?,"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that was physically painful to watch. No, wait a minute! it was only ten minutes ago! After twenty minutes of mindless boredom, we ripped the DVD from the machine and threw it out. This has got to be one of the worst movies, one of the worst wastes of time, and certainly the worst theatrical experience in my life. Don't buy it! be afraid! be very afraid!"
4,Love this movie.,I bought it originally on VHS. I have been updating my library to DVD and decided that it was time to update Cannonball Run.
4,cross country race,this is a silly/comical race across the U.S. with all kinds of situation (and anything they can get away with) happening along the way to the finish line.
4,This is one fun ride!,"I saw this movie when I was 11 years old and thought it was great back then. I watched it again recently and thought it was still funny and the cars where still cool. The story isn't the greatest in the world, but the actors and actresses looked like they had a great time making the movie, especially when you watch the credits at the end! The Black Lamborghini in this movie still looks fanantasic - I forgot how much I liked that car! The movie is pretty short and there are laughs throughout! This isn't your Oscar winning movie, but it is a movie that seemed like it would be a lot of fun to make and be in. The DVD looks very good and the DD 5.1 sound is also good. This movie is worth the price - cheap!"
4,Cars and Stars,"This surely has to be one of the 80's classics! Not only for the amazing car scenes, and classic actors but the gag value is priceless, ""They weren't fathers, they were ...""! JJ McLure aka Burt Reynolds in his prime! I can watch this film over and over, and as for the final out takes, well you have to buy it for those alone."
5,A great movie,"This is an great ""racing"" movie, they have an competition across the US. Great movie. Buy it NOW!"
5,What did you expect?,"This is a goofball comedy with a top of his popularity Burt Reynolds, a young Farrah, and two pickled Rat-Packers. Brilliant! This movie wasn't made for Cannes... Cans of beer, maybe. An all-timer when it comes to FUN movies. I still want a black Countach with gold campy's and a front wing!"
4,A Blast from the Past,I grew up on movies like this. It was so much fun to get to watch this again. I was thrilled to get it on DVD.
3,Cannon Ball Run - Review,"Burt Reynolds, Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Peter Fonda, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Chan are all entrants in an illegal cross-country car race, and all are willing to do anything to win. Chockablock with cool cars, fast driving, wacky hi-jinx and sexual innuendos, this crowd pleaser from former stuntman Hal Needham is based on an actual car race (which the director and writer both entered driving the ambulance seen in the film)."
4,CANNON BALL RUN,"Its a classic, brought back old memories. very funny..If you haven't seen it you need to add it to our library.."
5,The Cannonball Run,"""The Cannonball Run"" movie is a hilarious movie with all the greatest movie stars ever. You'll be laughing your pants off during the whole movie as you watch the stars & their races race across the US."
4,Langue : ''Francais'' ???!!!,"Langue : ''FRANCAIS'' ???Mme/Mrs Bonjour,En regardant la fiche tech. de ces DVD je me suis rendu compte qu'ils ne sont pas disponible en version Franaise!!J'ai d'excellents souvenirs d'enfance en visionant ces films,( Canonball Run 1 & 2 , Smockey & the Bandit) mais le problème est que lorsque je les écoutaients, enfant ils passaient à la télé en franais .Pas tous bilingue :("
1,burt plays burt plays yet another redneck speed junkie in yet another chase movie,"Wow,is the world so starved for chase movies that is mindless junk is sen as a great movie. if you like chase or race movies get ""cannonball"" or ""the gumball rally"" instead. this is just one long mug at the camera by burt and friends with the one scene that is in every burt movie where he gets dramitac for a second and tells the reason he is like he is.(it was used to good effect in the longest yard,was ok in smokey and the bandit,and reached it's worst in this movie and stroker ace)burt moans all the time in interviews that he's not taken serious as an actor,well movies like this is the reason why,he doesn't act he just mugs for the camera and smiles,it takes more than that to be thought of as a great actor."
1,Should Have Won An Academy Award For Best Picture!,"Yeah, right!This film reeks. A bunch of people decide to disregard all traffic laws, waste gasoline, and endanger innocent lives just to be the first of many to drive cross-country. Hoo-Boy! Now that's entertainment!I supose a bunch of guys juiced up on testosterone might like this film, but that's about it."
3,Great band but...,"The trio of Perez, Blade and Patitucci is outstanding on this disc. This is passionate interplay at its very highest level. I'm a long time Shorter listener. Probably my favorite tenor saxophonist but the down side of these performances for me was Wayne's execution overall. There is lots of passion in his playing but I found it technically somewhat lacking at times to my ears. If you can get past that and I'm trying, you will love what happens here if you like spontaneous interplay with obscure (at times) variations on unusual themes. Saw this group several years after these recordings and they were equally outrageously inventive and inspired. Blade is a joy to watch."
3,Cruise control,"Master musicians driving on cruise control, waiting for inspiration, waiting for the real thing. That is my feeling when listening to this record. Almost as if Wayne Shorter was feeling bored and decided to play with the critics, to test if they come up with 5-star reviews no matter what he puts out. You can safely skip this CD."
2,Just..not very good,"I really like Wayne Shorter. I've liked everything from his early Blue Note recordings through Weather Report and most of his recent stuff. But I have an incredibly hard time listening to this cd. It seemed like it would be a great cd. I mean..John Patitucci, Wayne Shorter, and Danilo Perez should be pretty hard to beat. But I do not hear anything special here. I was incredibly disappointed with this cd."
1,false image,I found this product to be non forgiving. After applying and going outside the product looked like makeup on my legs. I wanted something sutle and natural looking. This product looked like makeujp.
4,"Great SyFy, non-governmental black ops","Robert Urich is a bit over the top with his character. JoBeth Williams is a little too soft for a veteran from the military & newly appointed sheriff - but patience will reward you. The story is great. I am so glad ""they"" finally put this on dvd, I can finally toss my personally recorded vhs. Thank you."
3,mixed review,this is a great movie. however I wish the seller would have indicated that this DVD will play only on a DVD player.I have a DVD/recorder & I had to borrow a DVD player to watch the movie. I know its not the sellers fault the DVd is has this restriction but i would have appreciated it if the seller had this on the ad.
1,BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING,I have to be honest this book is horrible! I did somehow manage to finish it though. There are constantly new characters being introduced and they serve no real function to the story. The ending is horrible too!There is noway you could possibly solve this yourself because she introduces new evidence on the last few pages. Nothing really motivated me to turn the page and keep going. Takes forever to finish because it is so stupid! Don't waste your time or money unless you want to use it for a bonfire!
1,Diffucult to finish and poorly crafted,"Based on a recommendation from a friend, I read this book and was disappointed with every page. The plot set up was poor, the mystery was boring and the ending was a farce. So much for recommendations."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on.,"My brother told me that I could mow the lawn and have a more exciting adventure than this book. A mystery book is supposed to have some element of supense, this book lacked so much that when he had 6 pages left he was able to put the book off one day....what kind of book can't hook you when you have 6 pages left??????? Stephen Hunter - Dirty White Boys - now that's a book that will hook you"
3,"Not the best, but an okay read","I really enjoy this series, but this was a bit of a disappointment. I enjoy the titles and the characters. If you haven't read any of these yet, don't start with this one. Go back to the beginning and build up to this one."
4,"The ""Mob"" comes to Hillside Manor","Judith Flynn, proprietor of Hillside Manor Bed and Breakfast thinks that it's business as usual as her guests arrive for the weekend. It seems like a typical group with a single man, a newly-married couple, a mother and son, a pair of nursery school teachers, and a surly couple from Chicago. However, there is soon a dead body at the B & B and it becomes apparent that no one is who he says he is. As usual Judith claims to have instinctive powers of observation and deduction, but this case has even Judith stumped. A complicated web of interrelationships is eventually revealed, but this just makes it more difficult to solve the crime. Another feature of this addition to the series is the appearance of Judith's first grandson, Mike and Kristen's baby. Even this event is not an undiluted joy when Judith finds out the baby's name. If you're a ""cozy"" fan, you'll probably enjoy this one."
2,Not up to Snuff,"I was pretty excited when I saw that GU was coming out with their 32nd release from the DJ series. It looks as if I will be anxiously awaiting the 89th release one day as my appetite for new GU doesn't seem to be waning...unless of course there are too many more like Freland's weak release. Nick Warren never seems to let down, his Paris mix still seeing a fair amount of playtime on my ipod. Danny Howells came out with a pretty good one from Miami, but the Freeland mix is dilute, forgettable, and just seems to meander aimlessly. There is one highlight on disc 2 and that is the Silvrsun Pickups with a track called 'Lazy Eye'. I copied that track to the end of the disc onto itunes just so the $20 I spent to preorder this wasn't a total waste. I definitely wouldnt recommend spending much of your hard-earned money on this mix."
1,Worst Global Underground Ever,"I am completely sickened by the junk on these two cd's. I'm a big fan of breaks and this album is the Worst breaks set I've ever heard. Every track is annoying, and nothing fits. Try Adam Freeland's Coastal Breaks or Tectonics which are both phenomenal. Unfortunately Adam is devolving as a dj and that's sad to see. Do Not waste your money when there are soooo many great Breaks compilations."
1,Humdrum from GU??,"Like some of your other reviewers, I was very disappointed in this new offering from Global Underground, so I sold it after just 2 listens. The beats are relentless but uninmaginative and the whole 2 discs are so forgettable. There's no innovation. Adam, grow up and get some more gigs under your belt before you go to GU again."
5,a BREAK from the norm,"no, this is not the typical GU fair. and thank god. freeland really throws some dirty beats down. i saw him in austin playing a similar set while promoting for the GU32 release, and it was one of the hardest, dirtiest, breaks sets i've seen. good stuff.if you think this is ""just noise"", then you haven't been paying attention to the scene lately, which is where freeland pulled this mix from."
1,Two CD's of noise,"I have to agree with the other reviews that came in at one star. If they had a rating of zero stars these CD's are awful enough to have deserved a zero star rating. If you are into sounds that mostly make you cringe then this is certainly your style. NO need to go on any more, but there's not a single track on these 2 CD's worth listening or dancing to."
2,Disappointed Freeland fan,"I'm usually love Adam Freeland's stuff. I have several of his albums and his Essential Mix on Radio1 a few years ago is still in my playlist as one of my favorites. Also a huge fan of the Global Underground series (I have every one of them), I was excited to see Freeland's name in the lineup. Sadly, I think this is my least favorite GU so far.I'm not sure what Adam was trying to do here, but disk one just never really gets going and disk two is just a mess. There are so many times in it where it seems like he thought ""let's just make a ton of random noises here and see how it works out."" It didn't.I was very disappointed with this release and hopefully Freeland doesn't go quite so experimental if he gets another chance on the label."
5,Ethereal and Transcending,"This album builds a tapestry of diversity, depth, and breadth that few artists can emote as Williams has. His love for the music of the guitar and willingness to lovingly and abundantly share it differentiates Williams as a unique spirit. Many of his contemporaries would do well to study at his feet and realize the exhilarating joy of performing for the sake of, and beauty of, the art as Williams freely and unpretentiously reveals. You will be lifted up to a rarely experienced aural realm by this masterpiece of passion, grace, joy, and love. Truly, this work is a genuine monument and praise to all who have contributed to Williams' transcendence to the consummate performer and artist he has become."
5,Romance of the Guitar,"If you are looking for music that is quiet, peaceful, relaxing and romantic then this is it. This is a wonderful CD and I am very happy I purchased it."
2,Not a highpoint,"Unfortunately, Willie Colon's best recordings are not as readily available. This one looks good, as the pairing of Willie Colon and Hector Lavoe is a good one; however, the tunes just aren't that good. What can you do? Look for the compilation ""Crime Pays"" or some of their earlier recordings like ""El Malo"". Check out ""El Juicio"". Avoid this one, unless you're an incorrigible completist."
1,Well.. they looked good,I bought these for my company truck F-250. The ad copy had good words... tough.. fiberglass backing etc.. The did bolt on fine. In less than one month one of them had split across the center about 10 inches. I called the seller and they said... we only warranty these for 14 days.. after that nothing. I would expect them to last more than 14 days. I dont even know if a defect warranty can be just 14 days. I am trying to get Amazon to help me but so far not luck.Also.. when contacting the seller ( I found their phone number on the web) I think I woke someone up.. it took a while for them to get back to the phone after answering.Too bad.. these mud flaps do look nice when they show up. Just not nice a couple of weeks later. Mine were not rubbing on anything and look absolutely brand new except for being split in half.I hope they can send me a new flap.. or refund but they say no.. 14 days have passed.Dont Buy These.
4,Internal Void,Maryland style doom. Not the best not the worst. Is it a must have? That depends on how into Maryland doom you are.
2,Blurry pictures,"We bought this camera last year right before Christmas. It is okay outside, but terrible inside. If there is the slightest movement the pictures are blurry. We have tried all different settings with the same result and are very unhappy with the product."
2,the con,"CONS: I just dropped this camera ONCE and now when you push the ON button you can no longer see the image that you are about to take. This has been the only accident and there it goes, I can no longer see anything on the screen.This camera also blurs very easily, but you can get use to it."
4,s9 nikon,the quality of nikon is still no. 1. night shots with flash are ok. I like the non-protruding camera lens technology and just fits me. Good buy for me.
2,Cool Camera......Bad White Spots,"I really liked this camera.........cool looking, easy to use, and it takes great photos with natural light.......... But when you turn out the lights and need to use the flash......well just like many people here will tell you(read reviews for coolpix s5, this camera has same issues).........RANDOM. WHITE. SPOTS.Sometimes 15 other times 1 or 2. For me it occured on about 90% of alll photos that require use of the flash. Now I bought this at best buy and I took it back and got another coolpix s9 ( I really like the camera) and the same thing happened. Of coarse the Best Buy ""Digital experts"" told me it was user error. I'm glad to see its not just me."
3,Camera,"Used Camera in good condition, but has something wrong with it! Doesn't work properly, but still usable!"
3,Good all around camera.. bad for nighttime shots,"Great day pictures (clear, good color).. decent action shots (not too blurry).. nice features (black and white..sepia tone.. portrait etc).. but terrible night shots (concerts.. going out... outside in evening)... Really frustrating. It's the only thing that's bad about this camera..other than that the interface is nice, battery's are strong and it takes pictures fast...."
2,disappointment,terrible. Takes horrible pix - and have tried fiddling with all the different settings. Has a quirk that causes it to freeze up so you have to pop the battery out to make it work again. Couldn't get a sharp picture to save my life and there is a terribly long delay before the picture actually takes - huge loss for wanting to take pix of our newborn.
1,Breaks with poor repair support.,"I am holding a great paper weight. A 270 dollar camera that broke with no reason to break. This camera looks like it just came out of the box. The camera's menu suddenly stopped working, and the picture of the menu distorts and flickers. The buttons do nothing, and the only way to turn it off is by removing the battery. Nikon will fix it for [...]. Not worth it. I will by a reliable brand, from A company that realizes that the consumers are the reason they are in business. The pictures it took inside were so so. the flash overexposed everything, outside pictures werent too bad, but the random breaking of internal buttons or lcd screens is a problem. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY TO REPAIR SOMETHING YOU DID NOT BREAK."
1,quit after 1 year,I bought the Coolpix S9 in March of 2007--it lasted until June 2008. Just quit working and Nikon wanted $99.50 to repair. I bought a Canon Powershot and donated the Nikon to a camera shop.
2,Not as good as Canon,"I bought the Nikon Coolpix S9 as a replacement for my Canon PowerShot S410 because I wanted a lighter, less bulky ultra-compact camera with good picture quality. The S9 was the one of the lightest, and earlier versions of the Coolpix family received decent reviews.While the camera is light and fits nicely in my pocket, I must say I was not pleased with the quality of the photos I took with the Nikon Coolpix S9. Most photos taken with flash in dark rooms came out blurry and washed out white, and often had lens flare. And photos taken with flash off did not come out as clear as they did with the Canon S410. Photos in normal lighting with flash on came out okay, but still did not match the quality of the Canon.I'm returning the Nikon Coolpix to Amazon today and purchasing a Canon."
2,Red-eye reduction doesn't work!,"I chose this camera specifically because of the advertised in-camera red-eye reduction fix. I have a new baby and like any proud parent, take loads of photos of him. It is a pain to have to fix the red-eye manually in Photoshop, but at the same time I don't want to lug around (or learn how to use) an SLR type camera. I thought the Coolpix S9 would be the solution to my problems. While the photos are very crisp and clear, the red-eye is worse than in my old Casio digital camera and the flash really washes out indoor photos taken at night. In fact the flash is so bright it makes my son turn away from the camera, so the pictures that didn't have red-eye were all of the back of his head! I returned this camera and am renewing my search for something that will meet my needs."
5,A very good primer on Christian philosophy/theology of politics,"Paul Marshall's book should be ""must reading"" for every evangelical Christian who wishes to have a biblical understanding of politics in our age.We live in a very frustrating time: (1) It is a time of ever-increasing polarization in the political realm - left and right demonize each other, and Christians are caught up in the hateful rhetoric. (2) A frustrating amount of Christians are misinformed about Christian political theory by pop Christian media sources. (3) Politicians seek to manipulate evangelicals with inflamed rhetoric in order to win our votes.Marshall cuts through it all with clarity and well-researched insights of what Christians should consider when thinking about policy issues in America."
1,Misleading,"I was happy to find a diaper ointment without petroleum products in it. However, this product still contains known carcinogens. I had to look up the preservatives on the EWG (Environmental Working Group) website. If anyone is interested, I have discovered Badger Balm. It is the only certified organic diaper ointment I have found, and I believe I may have researched them all. Some products claim that they contain organic ingredients (and that may be true) but they usually also contain a number of poisonous chemical fillers and preservatives. Down with the chemical industry!! ....lol.....but seriously"
2,Keep looking...,"At first, i was VERY impressed with this ear jack. it was loud, clear, and had an anti wind feature that made it awsome. But, sadly, not even 1-1/2 months later, like most ear jacks, it will not work properly. So, great out of the box, but short lifespan"
1,Earpiece uncomfortable and awkward,"As the other reviewer said, if it doesn't fit you should return it. Uncomfortable, won't stay in place, wobbles, etc. Don't know how well the other control buttons work because I could never get the danged thing to stay in my ear to use it."
1,"""If it doesn't fit, you must return it."" the late Johnnie Cochran","What can I tell you... this didn't even come close to fitting my ear. It hung there, loose and unstable. Weird design, for me... wondering how this fits anyone. Never even used it for calls..."
4,"Forget bluetooth, go with this one!","I use a blackberry as my phone and hate holding the brick up to my ear to talk. I have tried numerous headsets and this is by far the best! I'm also very picky about electronics and read may reviews before purchasing an item, so if you're like me, keep reading.I've tried bluetooth headsets and found they all produced too much static and anyone I spoke to said I sounded distant. I've tried other wired headsets and they either fell off my ear or made it sound like I was on speaker phone. This is the ONLY headset I have found that 1) stays on my ear very comfortably and 2) sounds great both to me and the person I am speaking to. In fact, no one I have spoken to while wearing this headset has been able to identify that I was wearing a headset.The only reason I gave this headset 4 stars instead of 5 is that I find it to be a little quiet. It may just be my phone's output, yet I do wish the speaker was a little louder sometimes."
2,"Couldn't Hear Well, Not Sure Why?","I bought this one after my wife already bought another one almost identical to this one at Wal-mart and she really liked it. She used it on our home phone and I was buying this one for her cell phone. She plugged it in and the volume was too low no matter what we changed in the settings. We then switched back to the other head set she bought at Wal-mart and it worked great. I still think, since they are both Plantronics and look identical except for a small on/off button on the one from Amazon, that they would be of the same quality- so it probably was a ""lemon"" set and wouldn't be typical, unless others have similar problems with this particular model. I sent it back. (Amazon does provide for a very simple and easy return)"
4,Great hands free headset,"I own two of these headsets and they are great. I had bought several different ones for my panasonic phone at the office and the main problem was that all of the others were really bad when trying to hear the other person and the mic was not good enough either.This one attaches to the ear very nicely and the sound is great. I would wish a bit more volume on the earphone, but its ok in almost all situations.The mic works really good too."
2,Falls short,"I've had very good experience with other Plantronics products and this one does not measure up to the others. It is difficult to get a good fit on the ear, due to that or perhaps otherwise, the audio is difficult to find a range for comfortable listening and the people I am talking to express some concern about a somewhat muffled sound of my voice."
4,nice headset.,"I used this headset for work, and also for my cell phone while driving. It's nice, the person on the other end of the line can hear the conversation well, compared to other headsets I currently use. it has a mute feature that is nice for conference calls. I'd recommend this headset for work especially."
5,Christina,"I ordered two of the MX510-X1 headsets. One for the house and one for the car as our state now requires hands free use of cell phones. It is comfortable to use(may use several hours at a time), comfortable in the ear and certainly relives the stress of using a portable phone. Will plan on reorder in the future."
5,Burton and Elfman's Best Work Yet!,"With wonderful acting by Depp and Ryder, and beautiful music by Elfman, ""Edward Scissorhand"" is by far the best romantic comedy of the twentieth century."
5,Great Movie and Great Acting.,"I had seen this movie when I was a kid and decided to revisit it after watching some of Johnny Depp's newer movies (Pirates of the Carribean, Willy Wonka etc.). Depp's performance in this movie is just as outstanding and intriguing as his other movies. His character is a machine that was turned into a human and his performance is believable. This movie is also a true Tim Burtonesque film. The imagery is quite contrasting with brightly colored homes in the community contrasting the dark and bleak mansion on the hill. This movies message is quite strong and worth showing to children and adults of all ages."
5,Embarassed To Admit,"I am embarrassed to admit that this film is still one of my favorite Christmas works. It is more than a teenage love story; it is the story of artists with the weaknesses and scars they carry. It is these miscarriages that propel their desire for perfection, they perfect in their art what they lack in their heart. This film, simple as it is, is near perfection. I have always desired a sequel, one involving the granddaughter some twenty years later. It seems this role was and is for Johny Depp alone."
3,Despite my love for Depp and Burton,"...I just don't care for this production as much. I do give in props from being a stunning visual spectacle, but that's just about it. I wanted a little more depth and I found Edward and Kim's love story too weak by half. The suburbanites were funny and how society tends to lift things up only to tear them down was a nice touch. Still, overall I thought it was just okay."
2,"Great movie, but disk doesn't work","Edward Scissorhands is one of my all time favorites, especially because of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp who are both amazing. I ordered this blu-ray disk from Amazon in March, but didn't try to watch it until this summer (after the return date). I discovered that the audio worked only partially. Sounds such as background music and sound effects were played, but things like voices did not. I checked all the disk settings and nothing would fix it. No other DVDs or Blu-Rays had this problem in my blu-ray player. I don't own any other players that support blu-ray, so I couldn't test it out. I contacted customer service about the problem and they told me to try it in another player, but I told them that's not an option. They were very helpful and I ended up getting a new disk with a discount, but the new disk had the same problem. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I am very disappointed. I spent all this money and time, and I still can't watch my movie."
2,IMAGE PHOTO ISN'T CORRECT,WHY IS IT WITH THE MOVIES HERE THAT THE IMAGE IS NOT THE SAME AS WHEN IT ARRIVES EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE SAME MOVIE?
4,"'Tis true, this is a hard world","It is so hard to survive in this world. It is such a cruel, cold, heartless one, especially if you are an outcast or even the slightest bit ""different"". And if you are VERY different, then you cannot survive--for long. This tale of a man who was artificially created, who has a heart and everyhting else, but whose creator died before he could finish his hands--leaving them as deadly sharp, terribly menacing--looking things, this tale of the ultimate outcast, it beautiful, mythical, and heartbreakingly REAL. The costumes, set, and soundtrack are gorgeous as well. Johnny Depp is adorable--his face is so exqusitly innocent in this. If you need to be inspired to change the world, see this, and let's change it together. There is strength in numbers. Enjoy."
1,Blu ray audio,"I bought the Blu-ray version of this movie. It comes with some HD-DTS english audio and no other english option which does not work on all Blu-ray players, so be cautious getting this version, unless you want to be stuck only being able to listen to it in French or Spanish. That's the only reason I give the Blu-ray thumbs down. The picture was fine, the special features worked fine, but there was only music and background sounds. No spoken voices as t all in the DTS, which once again is the only English choice that comes with this, besides the audio commentary, which works fine also."
2,Silly Movie,"Did not enjoy movie, too silly and fantastical. Acting OK by Johnny Depp, but some of the other actors are TV soap grade!"
4,Pretty good Tim Burton movie,"I am a huge Tim Burton fan. I have always loved the vast atmospheres that Burton always has the audience experience. This movie is no exception to that. You get your dark mansion on a hill overlooking a conservative town. At first everyone loves Edward, then the town begins to turn against him. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but I prefer the atmosphere and mood of Sleepy Hollow better. I recommend seeing both of these well told Burton tales."
4,The saddest movie of all time.,"I have only seen this movie a few times. The reason being that it is without a doubt the most tear worthy film ever made. I cant watch it without wanting to burst out crying, which is unusual for me. Johnny Depp is wonderful as usual as the poor Edward, inspiring sympathy in even the most cold hearted viewer. He owns the film and maintains Edwards naive mystique until the very end.A truly, inspiring, wonderful film."
5,Wow,"This is a truly mysical film. It will blow you away with its amazing atmosphere, and haunt you for years to come. I mean God, it really is an amazing movie. You've gotta see it! ;)"
3,A true work of art!,"This has certainly got to be one of Burton's most imaginative creations. I can't remember a movie be that puzzlling, and yet so interesting and fun. Only Jonny Depp could prouduce such a voice, and performance. And that hair! Well, that was just the final icing on the cake. Let's face it. It's not easy to act the part of a lonly anodroid,and especially one that looked on with curiosity one moment and hated the next. Horror king, Vincint Price does a good job too as Edward's maker. Who is despreat for companionship. I laughed, I cried, then I laughed some more. All in all, this is not that bad of a movie."
5,"Heart-Warming Retellng Of ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Phantom Of The Opera,"" ""Beauty & The Beast"" And Other Stories.","Tim Burton's follow-up to ""Batman"" is a modern reimagining of ""ThePhantom Of The Opera,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""Beauty & The Beast"" and other stories of people who are deformed on the outside, but their hearts are noble. As a disabled person myself and one who has experienced ridicule and rejection, I can clearly relate to Edward Scissorhands. Rated PG."
1,YEAH NICE TRY FOX STUDIOS!!,Yeah listen everyone this is exactly same release as before only they put it in some cheesy looking Tin with some lame photos...Boring. The movie is great but seriously Fox studios you could try to be more cunning by at least adding something different to this anniversary edition!! Nothing...Same exact dvd but they added a slipcover Give me a break...PLease do not buy awful re-release...
4,Great movie,"For the price, I loved this movie. Watching it for the first time in 6 or 7 years. I liked it."
5,golden classic,"I grew up watching this movie and i will surely enjoy watching it on HD , i recommend this movie."
1,movie,"I have been unable to download this movie on my Kindle Fire no matter what I have tried. Heard its a good movie,but without me being able to download it I would not know."
3,Cute BUT A LITTLE SCARY!,this is a great movie...any movie with Johnny Depp is great so take the time to check it out...by the end of the movie you will really feel for edward and wish him the best. GOOD MOVIE!!
2,This was a good movie at the time.,"I was really impressed with this back in the 80's but now it's really old and really bad. If you loved it at the time, do yourself a favor and hold onto those memories and don't see it again no matter what you do. It's terrible 20 years later."
3,Intresting But Too Strange,"This is a intresting movie. Johnny Depp, is one of the only reasons why I rate this movie a three. His role playing Edward is very powerful like all his other roles, but the movie is just a bit too odd for me. The movie is very dark, and gloomy, and very strange."
1,Don't overthink it; this movie is just lame,"1. It's amazing how people will try to analyze this film, cry for unclear reasons, and try to be the deep intellectual media critic with this movie.2. The bottomline is that this movie is strange, boring, dumb and very very very pathetic... You would be much better off getting out there and living in the real world."
3,Beauty and the Beast Meets Goth Frankenstein,"This dark and odd fairy tale is an interesting and somewhat original watch, but calling it a masterpiece is a bit too much. It`s not very surprising once it shows its main premise, showcasing the innocent and naive outsider entering a new and ""beautiful"" world. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is just another movie about an outcast who doesn`t quite know how to connect because he`s ""different"". Director Tim Burton presents a captivating and well-crafted atmosphere here, surreal, oniric and gloomy enough to catch one`s attention. Johnny Depp provides a solid performance as the fragile and curious protagonist, and the rest of the cast is good as well. Overall, this is a poignant and absorbing offbeat effort, one that proves Tim Burton`s uniqueness and creativity.A memorable cinematic experience."
4,"A Strange Story, but Beautifully Told","One of Tim Burton's earlier films that showed the budding filmmaker's unique style and voice, Edward Scissorhands also featured a young Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder early in their careers. The start of Johnny Depp's choice of quirky characters and collaboration with Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands told a story of a lonely boy born with scissors for hands. Of course Johnny Depp brought much sensitivity and vulnerability to a role that barely had any dialogue. Winona Ryder is pretty and sweet as the girl next door who befriends Edward. Quirky but cute. If you are not a Johnny Depp or Tim Burton fan, you will be after seeing Sleepy Hollow where years later, both Depp and Burton has developed more of their talent."
5,Wonderful classic!,"This truly is an incredible and memorable film. I saw it when I was a kid, and then again as an adult, and I appreciated it as much - if not more - the second time around. The storyline might be a bit weird for some, but it really is an awesome and poignant film with good writing and acting."
5,the best film in the world!!!,"i think that this sad but incredible film is outstanding. With an original idea you cannot loose intrest. I think Edward is a charming, gentle man but understandably gets angry towards the end and eventually kills an enemy."
4,Great Film...problem DVD,"This DVD claims to be a 10th anniversary edition. I was really excited to hear what Tim Burton and Danny Elfman had to say in their interviews...problem??? Press either and you are wisked back to the openning menu. In other words ""they don't work"". I tried to view them on a Sony progressive scan DVD that is no more than a year old and then on my Dell computer. Both could play the movie, which is a real gem, but not the interviews. If the movie weren't so good I'd probably send it back as this is annoying...But hey, its a really cool film.Edward should be required viewing for children, it says so much about how quickly people can adobpt a gang mentality and stop thinking for themselves and it does it in a humorous way. Great movie for anyone whose ever been the ""odd man, woman, boy or girl out."""
5,Master Burton,This title is indeed very nice. Have seen an pre-copy of the film and it sure is a nice film. the picture is crisp and sharp and the sound is great. the film itself is a wonderful fairytale about a an unusual boy who falls in love. This is really Burton at his best!
5,"Really awesome, but sad, too.","This movie is a little smarmy at times, but it is REALLY good and Johnny Depp is REALLY cute and it makes me cry every time! LOL."
5,Snowy Greatness,"this movie is great! i consider this movie one of the best i've seen =) The love in this movie is unique and the humor is good. THe only thing i wasn't too well on was the ending/beginning! she should haf went back to the castle one day and pay him a visit =(i truly recommend you watching this. In this movie, Johnny expresses his cuteness in the outside instead of the outside.. which i find really great"
5,Tim Burton has done it again! Short/sweet review.,"STORY: A young woman goes up to a house on a hill and discovers a man named Edward, a man for scissors for fingers. She takes him home and shows him to her family. So then, Edward makes plant sculptures, haircuts, and is appreciated everywhere. But one day, Edward gets into trouble...THOUGHTS: Well done movie! Like a new-age Frankenstein, but way better. I like the scene where the kid shows Edward to the whole class. Excellent! And his weird haircuts and personality totally just keep you thinking ""He's so cool!""OVERALL: Go and buy this!"
2,an absolute best!!!,"This is such a great movie! It's kinda a romance-fairy tale, and I usually don't like romances, but this captured my heart! It was soooooo sad at the end. I bawled for ten minutes straight! Johnny Depp played Edward so well, it is hard to picture another Edward. Mrs. Ryder played Kim really well too. At first, I didn't like Kim cause she had this big maucho boyfriend that got on my nerves! Also she was so rude to Edward at the beginning. I felt sooooo bad for Edward cause he couldn't eat or drink. Also, when he poked a hole in the water bed, then ripping it to shreads when Kim finds him, that made me cry!I am such a sucker for this movie! *sniff*"
5,TIM BURTON'S MASTERPIECE,"Edward Scissorhands is without question director Tim Burton's masterpiece. While the director has made many creative and exciting movies before and after the film, such as BeetleJuice, The Nighmare Before Christmas, Batman and the remake of Planet of the Apes, none of his films come close to even touching Edward Scissorhands.While Burton's other films manage to grab the senses on a visual level instead of an emmotional level, Edward Scissorhands does both, with a combination of its gothic sets and special effects, stunning musical score by Danny Elfman (his best also) and empathetic characters that resemble you and me; characters that we care about.Edward Scissorhands is one of the greatest films ever made."
5,The Most Spectacular Film I have Ever Seen!,"This movie is the most wonderful blend of fairy tale elements I've ever seen. Tim Burton is a genius. The scenery in this film is beautiful, the acting is fantastic, and the story is heartbreaking. If you haven't seen this movie go out and buy it. You will love it, I promise. I't has always been my favorite and I'm sure it will also be yours."
5,Tim Burton delivers along with Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.,"This movie is excellent in every way. Tim Burton brings to life, a dream he had as a child. His imagination is incredible. The story is grand. Some scenes I was laughing,(like when he made the sheepdog look like a poodle). The acting is great. Johnny Depp rocks as Edward. No wonder Tim Burton chose him for Sleepy Hollow. Winona Ryder was great as the daughter who learns a profound lesson in life. The setting is crazy though. SO WHAT! The houses are all Pink, Yellow, or Blue. Hey, isn't that what society is like today, all those nosy neighbors. What would I know though? I live out in the boonies. But, the main thing I have to say is that Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Winona Ryder deliver a great story."
2,NOT A GOOD DIGITAL TRANSFER TO BLU-RAY!!,"(specific to blu-ray version) I pretty much said everything in the tag, i was pretty disappointed with the quality of the video. it had several very noticeable instances of lowered resolution in the beginning of the film and in other brief segments throughout. the audio sounds good and crisp but there is no major difference in richness when i compare it to the dvd edition i already had; and i don't think allot of work went into remastering the audio either. that being said i am not criticizing the original. Edward Scissorhands is my favorite tim burton film and i would gladly pay double what i did for a high quality blu-ray transfer, but it just wasn't worth it for this release."
3,"Great, Almost Perfect Video Quality","Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.I had read great reviews about the video quality of this Blu-Ray. I am somewhat disappointed. The colors are great, and the detail is good, but there is some fine grain in some background scenes that seem to fibrate (the grain seems to move). And, the vents in the outdoor air-conditioning unit suffered from video distortion, much like fine detail distorted on old-fashioned CRT TVs. If I had not read the reviews that said the video presentation was great, I would have been pleased with the video quality. The aspect ratio was 1.85:1, so it filled my LCD TV screen. I would have rather had 2.35:1.I was also disappointed in the audio, which was DTS-HD Master Audio, but only in 3.1 or 4.0 sound - there was no sound coming from the surround speakers."
4,Great purchase,"Wow through a Plasma 42 inch and a Ps3 it looked amazing, it just sucks I will have to buy these movies all over again but these blu ray versions are like watching a different movie"
5,Great Film,"this film is by far my favoite of both johnny depp and tim burton. it is happy, sad, funny, romantic, and exciting. being a huge fan of tim burton and having seen all his films, there is something about this movie that just stays with me. it is truly wonderful and i hope that if you have not yet seen it, that you go out soon and make sure you do!"
5,Amazing Performance By Johnny Depp,I've loved this movie since I was a kid and the Blu-ray just makes it come alive. Love It!!!! Depp is wonderful!!!!!!
5,Edward Scissorhands dvd,"Very good! Thank you for the item.I love this film!Hope to do more business soon, thanks again."
5,A very good movie!,This has been one of my favorite movies for years! Well all I have to say is please go out and get this movie! You'll be glad you did!
2,Pathetic Allegory or Mediocre Satire?,"Here is a review that lends credence to viewer/reader theory. The first time I saw Edward Scissorhands, I saw it as an allegory. Viewed within this framework, it is a film with nothing but the clichés of the Hollywood far-left worldview: the misunderstood, outcast artist unable to communicate to the world except through his art; the ultra-Brady Bunch peasantry to whom the artist tries to communicate; the nearly insane religious element. As an allegory, it was really pathetic stuff: one star.The second time I watched it, years later, I saw it as satire. Could Burton be witty enough to parody the Hollywood elite this way? Does he recognize and lampoon the anti-religious bigotry so prevalent among his colleagues? Are those who don't see it really the numb-brains who live in the pastel-colored rubber-stamp suburb? Viewing Burton's creation from this framework significantly improved the picture - three stars.I give the film the mean of the two scores."
3,Modern Day Fairy Tale,"Tim Burton's wild imagination is evident, and the setting and make-up bring you in to a Kitschy Avon Lady that rescues a scissorhand kindly Frankenstein from a mansion he shared with an inventor, before finishing him. No hands - just scissors and a kind heartOverall the movie is slow - you can only cut so many bushes, hairdo's, dogs, etc before a need for more action or an ending comes to mind.Peg Bogs the Avon lady brings him home to her family - this takes a leap of faith to believe. Of course Edward Scissorhands is misunderstood and gets into sad and illegal situations he is blamed for. He gets in trouble with the law and the neighborhood no longer wants him around.The cast does well, but the plot sags and the movie time could have been cut in half"
3,Snip...snip.,Ah...it was okay. A little heavy handed to say the least. The dark and gloomy meets the Brady Bunch. I don't know...it was okay.
5,love these- best canisters,These canisters are the best. They hold the vaccuum forever- easy to use and last forever. I'm not replacing- but adding on. I've tried other models and these are the the ones I choose hands down.
2,Rambling and Weak,"I loved the concept of this book. I only wish I had read an excerpt before buying it. The choices are fine, even daring. However, instead of insight, the reader gets poorly written stream-of-consciousness ramblings that add up to nothing but the author's feeble attempt to justify his choices...some of which he hasn't even experienced himself. If you like trivia or history, do not buy this book. If you like an author who thinks he is hip, smart, and funny but is none of these things, go for it."
2,the reader from california is right,"Interesting idea and selections, but the book is agressively poorly written. His entries provide no new perspectives on the selected works. He alternates self-praise for his ""Idiosyncratic"" selections with rage at anyone who would critize one of the works. Liner note writers, academics, SF critics and strawmen take hits while Williams delays engaging the works themselves."
3,Interesting - hard to take it in.,The first chapter was incredible. It got a little mediocre after that. I blame myself and not the artist. I read it twice to get it all (and enjoyed it a bit more after the second read) but I still think the motives of many characters and the ending in general is a bit confusing.
3,"Decent, but overrated","This book is by no means bad, its just not very good. Were this book an unknown writers first tale, or a 2.99 pickup at the comic shop, I would be completely satisfied with what I received. As it is, this book is often given credit that it simply doesn't deserve. The future Miller envisions is boringly realized. We see almost nothing outside of a small compound, and what we do see are humans reduced to monsters with no character at all. The title character is boring. He's a samurai who lost his master. Thats it. Thats your whole characterization. The twist at the end is unnessesary and somewhat silly. In short, its a decent book, but its not a classic. Way overrated, but still a good read."
2,"Caught my eye, then I washed it out","Really wished I could have liked this story. It had a good beginning and lead to some really great expectations. Unfortunately, it lead me the wrong way as I was severly disappointed in the ending. Just not my cup of tea. Friends of Marv, ask a friend to borrow first."
2,Overhyped crap!,"I found this book to be extremely boring. So boring that I only read half of it before I quit. The only reason this book gets two stars is because of Miller's artwork. And, as far as I'm concerned, his artwork is vastly overrated.Miller's best work continues to be his classic run on the ""Daredevil"" comic book series which I had the pleasure to read back in my comic days. If they ever collect those stories in a graphic novel format, then you will see Miller at his best."
2,Difficult for Beginners,"If you are taking an introduction to genetics course, this book is difficult to understand. It seemingly presents the concepts for those that have had previous knowledge of genetics. The chapters on Mendelian Genetics, Mitosis, and Meiosis are done well, but later chapters dealing with regulation, mutation, transcription, and translation are difficult to understand. The pictures are not very helpful, either. If this book is required for your introductory genetics course, i recommend getting another book in addition to this one."
2,Confused,"Seller sent the 6th Edition, but it doesn't look like the picture and it's the international edition. I don't think I would have bought the item if I knew it weren't the one being advertised."
1,OUCH!,"Worked pretty well the first season, but when I got them out this year they were DOA. Tried calling the customer service number, but can't seem to get through. Clever concept, but terrible execution."
1,"Uninspiring, Sad","We liked this video a lot from our past, but it was from our local library. I never liked Miss Mackenzie's voice; it always sounded too high and squeaky. I think the director should have worked on the pitch of the characters. I don't know if it was the video that made Miss Mackenzie sound awful or if it was the teacher herself. Anyway, I've always believed that Miss Mackenzie needed to work on her pitch just a whisker. Try this video with you, your kids, or even both and see if it works for you since it never worked with me."
3,Add to your dusty collection,"Iggy and the band deliver a drop dead five star performance.This is a must OWN for Iggy collectors and thats where I draw the line on this dvd. First off I think this is a bootleg of Iggy's ""Kiss my Blood"". The tip off wasthe opening credits and the video say ""Kiss my Blood"" . Christ! Is that even Iggyon the cover sleeve??? The camera work drove me crazy. Theres about 5 different cameras going with way too many CHEEZY MTV panned shots.50% of the time all you see is lame ass Whitey Kirst and his wanna-be rock star guitar playing. The sound quality is moderate at best.The one good thing I'd say is this dvd cost me $14.00 vs. dishing out over $80.00!! for the ""Kiss my Blood"" dvd.Over all I'd say get this for the documented footage factor. If you want a dvd with great quality and outstanding Iggy-fied energy check out the dvd""Iggy and the Stooges-Live in Detroit 2003"" Thats a must OWN/SEE."
2,Not as good as Halex,"This is hard to explain, but my reason for 2 stars is based on feel. The Cricket Pro just has a plastic, cheap feeling. The reason I bought it was becasue it has 4 displays for cricket. The bulls eye that spins is absolutely ridiculous and makes it feel even cheaper. Halex is better built and I like the sound when it hits the board."
2,unhappy user,"I bought this scanner 2 days ago in Phoenix and returned it today. Software takes almost 20 min. to install, is very confusing to use ( compared to a Visioneer 7300 which I have) there is no power switch meaning that the scanner is always on. But the warm up time is long and the scan is slooow and noisy. Cost was $199."
1,Slow Slow Slow!!! Software poor,"I bought this scanner because the image ratings were great. What I got was a scanner that spends more time warming up and thinking than scanning. This has caused a 4 fold increase in my scan times. As they say, time is money! Also, the software tools that come with have a poor, non-standard interface that required much head scratching. I just returned the scanner!"
4,"Basic interface, but effective!",Works wonderfully with my Integra DTR-8.8 receiver. Plus accepts all my universal remotes commands. The on screen graphics are a little on the crude side though. That's the only negative.Good product for IPOD people. (You know who you are...)
2,Poor product design,"I took a chance on this even after reading about the ugly on screen displays. And they are unattractive to look at compared with the elegant interface of Apple TV. The reason I returned it was that if you want to view your photos, slide shows, videos, TV shows and podcasts there is no on screen display! They refer you back to your iPod to manually select them. This makes the entire product null and void for anyone who does more than listen to iPod music files. It's an attractive dock but they need to go back and get it fully functional."
4,iPod Dock,It was easy to install and use. I would prefer a better link to the video on my TV but still well worth the money.
2,iPod dock,Disappointed in this product. Rather touchy and does not work all the time. Probably not my best purchase.
4,ipod Dock - Onkyo,This product was fairly easy to install and it gives me the flexibility to use my ipod with my other electronic equipment. Good Buy.
3,"Good dock, bad remote and even worse interface.","Looks nice, decent construction ...fits my Ipod okay once you adjust it. The remote is VERY counter intuitive. Not sure if it is my Onkyo 605 Receiver or the dock itself; but the way you choose your music and show video is both boring and also counter intuitive. What about the instruction manual that came with it you ask ...what manual? I learned nothing from that piece of paper. Don't forget to set the VIDEO SETTINGS on your Ipod to ""Ask"" or the video will not show through your TV."
3,Pricey for average performance.,"The unit is very easy to hook up and use if you have an Onkyo receiver. The bottom line is that a nice home stereo system exposes the compression of the mp3 and mp4 formatted music. If you want the ability to hook up your 160 gig ipod to your home system for background music, this is perfect. If you are looking for a way to jam your favorite tunes from your ipod through your home system, this is not the best method."
5,The best iPod docking station,Bought this product right after I purchased my new Onkyo receiver. Simple to hook up and offers a great on screen menu controlled by it's included remote control
5,Great product! No problems.,"I bought this as a birthday present for someone who had an existing Onkyo surround sound system. It works great and the recipient loved it! As always, I researched prices and Amazon even beat the manufacturer's website and ebay!!"
3,Works but...,"Difficult to setup, not plug and play, I needed to call Onkyo but tech support was very good, she had me up and running in short order. The on screen fonts are so bad they are laughable, everyone makes fun of them. I have used it with two iPods and an iPhone. There is limited support for video out, but this is listed as a limitation in the documentation and I have not been able to view video. The product picture does not show the wires coming out of the back of the dock, there is a power cord, an interactive control cable, a combo video, left and right channel - I wrapped the whole bunch together with Panduit spiral wrap to minimize clutter.It was nice to see what was playing and to be able control the iPod from across the room, the onscreen display makes it feel inelegant and out of place in an expensive home theater setting."
4,Must have addition to your Onkyo A/V system,"One of the best purchases I've made this year! Being able to listen to all the music off of my iPod while having the wonderful aesthetics of a cleanly designed piece. The best part of the docking station is the remote that comes with it. With the push of one button on the remote - the iPod turns on, the A/V unit goes to the proper channel, and I'm listening to my favorite tunes. A must have for any Onkyo system."
5,Easy iPod docking to Home Theater,I am using this dock with an Onkyo A/V receiver. Very easy to connect.
2,Difficult set up with SR-506 receiver,"I purchased the Ipod dock for my new SR-506 receiver, assuming the setup would be simple and sync well because both are Onyko products. Not so! The directions (non-user friendly, confusing, and requiring the manuals for both products) say to connect the dock with the RI (interactive-capable) compatible inputs for cable/sat and change the name on the receiver to ""dock"". However, I'm using the receiver with satellite TV and need that input display. Evidently, there are no other RI compatible inputs for the dock on the receiver, so I'm reduced to using inputs (AUX or TAPE) that require a separate (not included) video cable that must be connected directly to the TV (inconvenient because wall-mounted in my case). The dock is handsome, sounds good, and makes a good charging station, but is certainly is not the plug-and-play accessory for my Onyko system I imagined when I purchased it."
1,Onkyo DS-A2X,I purchased this unit on the assumption that I could display video from my latest generation Nano to my TV ... as yet no luck and would seem that this is not poossible. Very poor interface and the on-scrteen graphics are from the 80's. All in all very disapointed
2,"nice, but osd doesn't work","Overall, I like it, despite the following shortcomings. The interaction between the dock and the receiver is promising, except that the iPhone says ""accessory attached"" or something and since the ""on screen display"" won't display on the tv, I can't see what album, title, etc. is playing. I suspect it is an issue with the receiver (TX-SR505) not sending the video image on to the tv, but that is just a guess. I have to select the playlist or whatever and THEN plug the iPhone in to the dock. Lots of monkeying around with it so far and I'm still not done. Sounds great though. (Same issues with an iPod attached, btw.)"
2,ipod remote dock,"This dock is very problematic. It only works with certain ipod models and only with the most current ipod update. The on-screen display only lasts about 15 minutes, and the remote only works pointed at the dock, not at the tv. Even on 5th generation ipods, we can't watch a downloaded video on screen. This remote dock is only good for connecting and docking an ipod directly to your home theater system for listening to your library, so there are other, simpler ways to do that. Maybe this concept will be improved over the next year. (And it is used with a companion Onyko receiver in this application.)Onkyo DS-A2X Remote Interactive iPod Dock"
1,Not compatible with latest iPod models!,None of the information in the ad for this product states which iPod models are compatible with this. I had to return it as it is not compatible with the newest iPods.
3,Performs As Advertised,"The DS-A2X performs as advertised. Sound quality is very good. Connectors provided are medium quality. The picture sent to the TV is very low quality and it sends text only -- no artwork. It would have been better had they provided 'floating text' which would eliminate the need for a screen saver. The remotre is not intuitive and somewhat awkward. The product does what Onkyo says it will do, it provides a way to play music through your stereo or A/V receiver."
3,Review of Onkyo DS-A2X,"I ordered this product to work with my Onkyo 705 receiver and ipod. It works very well. My remote for the receiver runs the ipod dock which makes things easy. However, the on-screen display is not what I expected. I thought it would display what my ipod normally dispays on its screen. However, that is not the case. It only displays information (songs, artists, albums, etc.) in a typed format and looks more like an old ""DOS"" program than a windows-based program. Also, this information stays on full time when using the ipod so if you have a screen that is suspect to burn in (CRT, some plasma) you can not leave the screen up and running while listening to music."
5,An undeservedly forgotten musical gem.,"Originally issued in 1982, ""Profundo"" was Cheo Ferliciano's final Fania release--while not a strong seller it's very satisfying (musically). The breathtakingly-beautiful bolero ""Cantandole A Las Cosas Que Se Olvidan"" more than justifies buying this Cd but ""Isabel De La Noche"" and ""Periodico De Siempre"" are also standout numbers. Cheo is undoubtedly one of Puerto Rico's greatest singers."
2,Missing Marion!,"As an avid reader of this Avalon series, I was sorely disappointed in this book. One of the things I loved about the previous books was the mystique and magic of avalon. I found this to be lacking in this book as it focussed much more on history and battles and had (in my opinion) a very loose connection to avalon.It is a well written book, but it does sadly signify the end to the avalon series. The magic is gone."
2,"Totally without ""The Goddess""","Sadly lacking in the mysticism SO central to ""Mists of Avalon"", which truly was a MASTERPIECE. I could not recommend this book to anyone who has been enchanted by Marion Zimmer Bradley in the past, or to anyone for that matter."
3,Interesting,"One Christmas my grandmother gave me the Mists of Avalon and this book. I had already read Mists so I was eager to pick up another book by Bradley. Other then the fact that it dosen't take place in Avalon itself, Prietess was very good. It gives you more insight into the rule and role of the Lady of Avalon, the choices she had to make, the rules she had to enforce, the people she had to hurt. No other book has given so much insight into what went on between Lady and priestesses."
2,Disappointed,"Had waited and waited for another Marion Zimmer Bradley but have been sorely disappointed with this latest release. Unlike her other Avalon books, I found this extremely slow moving. I actually had to re-read parts as my mind drifted from boredom.The magic, mystery and excitement were missing. I will miss Marion."
3,Not the same calibur as Mists of Avalon.,"I enjoyed reading this book only because of its relation to the larger novel, The Mists of Avalon. I believe this book was also co-authored and was just not as engaging as the first novels."
2,Mediocre entry in a wonderful series,"Boy was I excited when I saw there was a new entry in this series. Then I learned that MZB was dead and a co-author had worked on the book too. It shows. I almost quit this one in the middle, but persevered to the end. It had its ups and downs, and it was better than lots of stuff out there, but I did not like it as much as the other MZB Avalon books. It felt formulaic at times, but it also differed from the other books in some bad ways. I missed the Avalon setting, and the legendary feel that made the other books so good. Set in the cold light of the Roman empire, the story lost its sense of fantasy. And there was just not enough adventure going on. Even the big romance left me kind of cold. To rank the four books in this series: Mists is by far the best, then Lady, then Forest, then Priestess."
4,A Welcome Addition to the Mists of Avalon Series,"If you're a fan of the Mists of Avalon series, you'll want to read this latest addition. Even though The Priestess of Avalon was co-written with another author, none of the Bradley style or quality is missing. Truthfully, I enjoyed this book as much as The Forest House and more than The Lady of Avalon. I look forward to reading it again in the future. (And I don't reread many fiction books.)"
5,Priestess of Avalon,This is another wonderful book from the Mists of Avalon series. Marion Zimmer Bradley died during the writing of this book and her partner finished. It is truly a wonderful continuation.
1,Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. I can't believe that this is written by the same person as wrote the truly wonderful ""Mists of Avalon"". The story is very superficial and the characters so undeveloped that I had no interest in them and did not care what happened to them.This book would have been better left unfinished."
1,An unfortunate disappointment,"I bought this book with the expectation that it would be another ""Mists"". Unfortunately, I was quite mistaken. I found this book to be so boring that I didn't even make it through the whole thing--I kept putting it down and picking it up a few weeks later thinking I would eventually finish it, but I never did. For one, Helena may start off as a strong character, but once her husband and son enter the picture, she becomes content to just sit back and watch all of the excitement happen to them. I found it odd that a woman with such intellect and education would quietly retire to her country house, only kept informed by letters and the once-every-few-years visit of her son. I'd recommend not reading this one. Read ""The Mists of Avalon"" again instead!"
4,Still a good book,"It didn't grab my attention as much as Mists did, but it's still a great book. Helena kind of irked me with her ""my son is the Chosen One"" babble (it seemed a little too cocky and self-assured for my tastes). Still, I got totally immersed in the story, which, as usual, was very well written. Definitely a good book for anyone who likes old settings and good storytelling."
3,"Priestess of Avalon is good, but not the best in the series","I was amazed to see this book; knowing that Ms. Bradley had died, I assumed the Avalon series was complete. I enjoyed the other three books to the point of distraction, and this one was no different. I read it in a day, ignoring everything else around me. It is a good read, but I did not care for the first person POV. This book is worth buying if you are a hard-core Avalon fan, as it does complete the series of four. It probably wouldn't do, however, for those who haven't read the other books to buy it. It can be read as a stand alone, but I feel it means more with the other books as a backdrop."
3,Different than expected,"I began this book sitting in Borders and would anxiously go back to there to read it do to limited funds -- the book, unlike ""The Mists of Avalon"" and its prequels, was still quite good. Its title is not inappropriate -- though misleading because of the afforementioned works. Who knows, maybe I enjoyed it so much because I am studying Latin and saw many connections with what I was learning, but I enjoyed it none the less."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"But better than some of the reviews I read here. Being Wiccan, and 'Mists of Avalon' having been on my beginning 'required reading list', I've followed the series with anticipation for each prequel. However, this one, while the beginning was good, the middle and near the end left me disappointed. While I can understand the meaning behind the somewhat heavy christian influence [after all Constintine did bring christianity into the open as an accepted religion and that story did need to be told in the wider scheme of things], I admit it made me uncomfortable. The love story was the one bright spot, as that was classic MZB [first love lasting for years, only to be lost]. I don't think this hurt the series, as a whole, but if not read in full context, one could imagine this to be solely about the birth of christianity, not the showing of the beginning of the legend of Avalon and the coming role it played in the legend of Arthur. A passable effort....but not a re-read."
5,"Great glimpse into Roman ""history""","Bradley weaves a beautiful tale of fact and fiction in ""Priestess"". Helena, mother of Constantine, is the central character. As a historian, it was a great treat for me to read such a lively account of this period of Roman history. While I am aware that Helena was, in all likelihood not a pagan priestess, it is a wonderful myth. There are enough elements of truth and solid historical fact to make the story stronger than that of ""The Mists of Avalon"", whose all-too-familiar plot dragged a bit."
1,Don't waste your time ! ! !,"This book was hugely over-written and extermely boring. I was tempted multiple times to just stop reading it, but I kept slogging through it, hoping it would get better. It didn't, until the very last chapter. If you are looking for the magical writing from the Mists of Avalon, it's not there - at least not in last three quarters.This is a huge historical read. There is chapter after chapter of detail about the growing Christianity and the battle between Christians and Paganism. The main character loses herself as an individual over and over again to support the men in her life, and in the end, becomes practically a slave to her son's bidding -- Constantine, the Emperor of Rome. It was pathetic to read."
2,"Fans of ""Mists of Avalon,"" don't get your hopes up...","I anxiously awaited this book as I own & reread Mists of Avalon, Lady of Avalon, and Forest House. I was extremely disappointed with this book, however.There is very little of Avalon or indeed Paganism after the first few chapters. The main character ends up basically turning to christianity. If I wanted to read about that, I'd go back to church. Gave the impression that worshipping the Goddess was not enough, though in the other 3 books in the series, it was the main idea. I skipped several sections and read it over the course of a week, when I usually read a book in a day or two. I also sold mine as ""barely used"" as soon as I finished it."
3,Stylish pants,"These pants offer great style, but would have been enhanced if there were side pockets as well."
4,real soul,"just imagine manu dibango playing his clasic soul makossa with ray barretto , mongo santamaria , and roberto roena on percussion .serious music i would buy it just for that and congo bongo is undescribeable . a must in any collection"
4,The Authentic Life of Billy The Kid,Thsi book was very interesting ecspecially the authentic verbage and grammatical errors. It was short and to the point Thank you
3,"Interesting, but not remarkable","An easy read, it was interesting, but it wasn't deep. I suppose it would provide some material for an historian, but only a surface treatment. It was worth the price I paid for it. Kindle edition was great because now the book doesn't further fill my bookshelves."
2,Hard to follow,"I would not recommend this book. I am an avid reader and had such trouble following it, I could not finish this book."
2,Could have used a ghostwriter here!!!,"Some very interesting facts are in this book. However, the book is dry and boring. So much work went into putting this book together, that it's a shame there wasn't a ghostwriter working with Mr. Garrett to capture the emotions and the urgency in what could have been a fascinating book. I'm afraid I only got halfway through this book, before I gave up. I hate to walk away from a book without finishing it... but there was no way I could finish this story."
2,A SHAME..,"A shame that Mr. Garrett had absolutely no writing talent at all, because the book could be good, dealing about one of the greatest legendsof all times."
2,Sad...,"Unfortunately, this book could have been much better, because it has authenticity: it was written by the man who killed The Kid. But Garrett's style of writing is horrible; it is an irregular narrative, without any talent. Sometimes it looks like a diary, sometimes it looks like written in a rush. I has absolutely no emotion about himself or the Kid and practicaly no in-depth research. It added most of the legends now surrounding the Kid."
2,Criminal meddling,"'...I have made some omissions of what was clearly irrelevant. The style has been clarified and somewhat modernized...' says the editor, Maurice Fulton. If that's what you want, fine, but personally, I prefer to decide for myself what is 'irrelevant', and as for the archaic style, that is part of the interest of historic texts. So I prefer editors to keep their distance, and not meddle too much.The second problem with this edition is that it dates from 1927 and so does not incorporate the latest research. There are editions on the market, including the 1994 Indian Head Books edition, that are simply reprints of this 1927 Fulton edition, so be warned. Fortunately there are many other later, unabridged and more authoritative editions available and so, if you want to read Garrett's book, you might want to hunt down one of those.[PeterReeve]"
2,An interesting book of sorts,This book starts out slow and dry. It didn't get exciting until Pat Garrett started to take over the story. This doesn't occur until about midway through the book. Don't expect this to be a screenplay for the movies Young Guns and Young Guns II. The book isn't that exciting but it does introduce you to an interesting character profile of Billy the Kid. Personally I feel that the first half of the book is fiction that is read for pure entertainment and the second half covers the real story of the Kid. I would recommend this book if you are interested in the Kids story and you want to read every angle of his story.
5,Thoroughly pleased,"It's an entire world away from the Young Guns movies, but it's a fantastic read. The words that Garrett uses are intelligent, but humorous because we are seldom lead to believe that common people from that time period were so educated. I think it's a great book, I recommend it to anyone."
5,Awesome,"I LOVE the book I think that everyone should read it cause it has some things that are sad,crazy,amazing,and cool."
3,"Great book, but arrived bent :(","Our son and all his friends love Maisy, so we bought this book as a gift for one of his friends. We purchased a ""New"" book from Amazon, but it arrived bent, possibly from shipping in a soft cushioned mailer. Disappointed, but too late to return it and request a new one, since it is a gift for a party tomorrow. :("
4,Excellent!,"It makes a good read, essential if you're serious about astrology, what can I say other than this?"
3,"Not the best Vitus, but still Vitus!","COD is really unfairly dismissed by lots of people. True, it't not VITUS' finest moment but it has plenty of classic crushing moments to appeal to even the most casual doom fan. The main problem lies in the vocals. The dude from COunt Raven is cool, but seems a bit outta place in Vitus. His vocals are just too flat and dull. The production is also just too clean and polished for what Vitus is. Alot of the grime and unbridled skronk is reigned in. That said, the record is heavy as [...] - its just that at times it sounds merely like a really good generic doom band instead of one of the GREATEST, most distinct sounding of all doom bands. At least the band more than made up for this ""good"" album with the next record DIE HEALING."
1,C.O.D. (or D.O.A.?),"I'm a longtime Saint Vitus fan, but they took a serious nosedive with this. Don Dokken produced the album, but his presence was about the only high point here; he gives the band a more ""polished"" sound, but the material is about as dull and uninspired as it gets, which clearly shows that Vitus was going through the motions musically and on it's last legs--vocalist Scott Weinrich was replaced on this album by Christian Linderson, who is even more dull and boring, and imitates Weinrich almost to the point of parody.Vitus did a rearranged version of it's own ""Hallow's Victim"" by slowing it down and naming it ""Exhumed"" (they should've left it buried), and guitarist Dave Chandler called himself ""D.C. Vitus"" on the credits (no doubt an ode to M.C. Hammer?). My overall opinion is, stick with the Scott Reagers-era albums on SST and don't waste your time and money; this CD is out of print and probably will never see the light of day again, and for a good reason: it sucks!"
2,"Heavy on Hype, Light on Information","I really wanted to like it, I didn't much care for the Ratner's Introduction to Nano. The two dish out a lot of hype (Imagine that... imagine that... Nanotechnology may do all of these things!) and not as much information as one would expect, even from a book mean to ease you into a topic.I found the writing totally average. Misconceived jokes and mechanical prose made reading the book most unpleasurable, and chapters are so divided that the book has very little continuity.Look somewhere else for a book on nano."

4,Not a bad book,"The book is what it says it is: A Gentle Introduction. If you want to know what Nanotechnology is before, for example, taking a course on it, this book will do the job.The authors state (on page 4) that they ""hope this book will be a quick airplane or poolside read..."". It will take somewhat more effort than that to grasp and retain what is written but it is still well within the compass of the ""intelligent layman"".From a stylistic point of view I found the book a little tedious hence four stars out of five.I also read ""Understanding Nanotechnology"" which covers much the same ground and which I prefered mainly on stylistic grounds."
4,"Easy to read, pictures are great","OK, the Internet boom is over. It looks like nano tech will be the next boom, and it will last a while. I wanted a book that would give me a good into to nano tech, but not be a dry read. This book is an excelent overview of the technology, and how it might be used. I really liked the color photos. In case you are wondering (I was), the thing on the cover is a ""Nano Tube"". It is very small, and very cool!!"
1,Wrong and boring,"I bought this book some time ago to learn about nanotechnology. As someone else has already mentioned, there is very little continuity. However, what makes me give only one star is that, in the fields with which I am familiar, there are serious errors. As a result, I cannot trust anything the book states in other fields."
4,A good overview of nanothech,"It's a tad bit technical for the lay-person, but it will definitley give one a solid grasp of what nanotech is all about."
4,"Convenient, though not precise","This nifty ""little blue book"" (as it is known in Assyriology ciricles) is an indispensible tool for students of Akkadian (from Old Akkadian to the Late Babylonian), whether as a quick reference, or for translating long passages of Akkadian texts. It has the advantage of being light and handy, and many entries are furnished with references to semantic variations based on the different dialects.However, in being concise, the dictionary chose to omit those lengthy lexical references which are presented in the bulky volumes of the CAD (in English) or AhW (in German, on which this dictionary is based), thus rendering an interpretation of texts based solely on this book somewhat unreliable. Yet this drawback has not prevented many aspiring Akkadian scholars from secretly using it whenever no one is looking!!A favorite amongst students ever since its first publication - highly recommended for any Akkadian students beyond the beginner level!"
4,BOSS Tweeters,"These are great tiny tweeters, but they have some trouble when playing at loud volumes. Maybe they can't support so much abuse but hey for $25 these are great tweeters not the best obviously but for the money your paying your not getting ripped off"
1,Severe Vibration - Fan out of Balance,"Bought the Ventamatic IF24 - 24"" Heavy Duty Exhaust Fan at Tractor Supply. The fan looked interesting: 4100 CFM, energy efficient, and fully balanced.First impressions, the fan was in the box and the bottom of the mounting frame was bent. Just minor sheet metal straightening, no major damage.I installed the fan and turned it on. To my surprise, as the fan came up the full speed it started shaking so violently the internal braces started to bend. Removed the fan and will be taking the fan back to the store tomorrow to exchange. Hope the next one will be better."
3,Did not like the sound and the hook for over the year,Did not like the sound and the hook for over the year
3,Auto Ventshades for 2004 Tahoe,"I like Ventshades, I already had some on my 2001 tahoe. I got these thinking they would be the same but they have changed since last time I bought them. The good, they are black not off color brown like my old ones. The bad, they are thiner than that of the old ones. The set I got my wife had a crack on the passenger side front (package / shipping?), I didn't notice till after I had the other 3 on: to add we were to leave out the next day for a long trip so I guess I will just live with it. They do not go down past the mirrors like the older ones as well. I'm not sure if I like this better or not, they don't fit as good because of that I think.I would advise to buy a set although I was happier with the old style; For this I give 3 stars.Part number was 194304. Review on 7-6-11."
1,Would be 5 stars if only advertised as physics B,"Last year I used only this book to test out of AP physics B. I got a 5 on the test, so clearly the book did a great job. However, this year in physics C, I am finding that this book is awful, particularly for electromagnetism. It gives no examples using ampere's law and its covering of induced emf is absolutely awful. The circuit examples it gives are too simple and the practice questions never require the calculus derivations (such as ones using Gauss's law) that are covered on the C test. I would use it again any time for physics B, but am truly dissapointed that it is also advertised as a book for physics C."
3,Material covered is ok but tests are outrageous,"When I first got this book, it looked ok. The material covered in sections is good for physics B. I recommend that if you take physics C however to not get this book and rather get the princeton edition that has covers only physics C. The material is sometimes however hard to understand when applied. The test questions however are a huge downside to this book. The test questions are ridicously hard and aren't exactly up to date with the actual AP test. The questions also involve a lot more calculation with the brain in the multiple choice since you cannot use a calculator and is basically an overall review of the book only if you read it. If your going to do the AP test at the end, warning, it is basically a combination of all the tests questions at the end of each chapter."
2,Retro Thinking for the Masses,"How can you beat a title like this? It offers a wide range of opportunities to explore the highways and byways of Medieval & Renaissance worldviews. Oldridge offers a unique insight into the how & why our ancestors viewed such transgressions to the social contract of the time, and the complete normalcy of those views. What I found off putting was the rather superficial coverage that is offered to the topics the author selects. I have found other books that explore similar topics with more depth and penache. A welcome addition for the beginning student of historical oddities library. The style of this book is scholarly in a Master's thesis sort of way with an odd forced sense of humor that is unwelcomed. It lacks the immediacy needed to communicate why we did & do the things we do as human beings. In the final analysis- we are still creatures of absurd superstitions & prejudices. One is left to wonder if evolution goes beyond mere biology?"
5,"Wry, sly and knowing","The second time I put this CD on the stereo, I felt as if I had already heard it a hundred times. There is something about the melodies and the lyrics of Sam Phillips that makes the songs irresistibly catchy.They're not catchy in a bubble-gum pop way, however. The songs catch me right in the gut. There is a part of me that responds wholeheartedly to a vision like that of Sam Phillips; a world which is wry, sly and knowing. This is music that is written to appeal to adults and people who think like adults.The friend who recommended the album to me said it was ""old-timey,"" but the more I listen, the more I think that's completely the wrong way to describe it. She uses old-time instrumentation that recalls jug bands, string quartets and lonely young women in walk-up apartments with acoustic guitars. But those voicings are assembled in a modern way."
1,What Happened?,"I thought ""Leslie"" bacame ""Sam"" to embrace a new and meaningful voice beyond the Christianese of her day. All I can see from her latest is meaninglessness. What happened to her relevance? Her music and lyrics seem to have become one big song instead of many and like an athlete beyond their prime that has stayed too long, ""Sam"" has changed for the worse. Its not that I cannot sympathize with her need to reflect her true heart but to ask anyone to pay for her right to express the same mood over and over again is too much to bear. Without judging her intent or content, at least make the songs sound different or even change key a little. She changed her name once so it shouldn't be too hard to change key. A boot and A Shoe--a one song album with 13 audio glitches called dead spots, and I don't mean the silence. DON'T ""play it again Sam."""
1,Overated,"This artist is way over rated. I guess if you know the right people, anyone can get a record contract. Her hubby is a famous producer and Sam once sang about Jesus so she uses her clout to make really bad music that nobody buys. A sad state of affairs!! Grade F-"
1,HORRIBLE,SAM PHILLIPS IS HORRIBLE COMPARED TO LESLIE PHILLIPS. ITS OBVIOUS SHE DID TOO MUCH BOOZING AND PARTYING TO SING ANYMORE. TOO BAD WHAT A WASTE OF A TALENT.
4,a lovely collection of songs,"Sam continues to grow as a writer, and performer. She continues to strip away everything, leaving only the essential, the essence of the song. And the results are quite wonderful. How nice to discover someone who can still write a melody that you enjoy singing - the kind you don't mind having stuck in your head for a while. A very fine recording, and highly recommended."
4,The way forward,"This book has two parts. The first part covers the city from the middle ages to the modern megalopolis (as of the 1930s when the book was written). The second part presentats the concepts of biogregions and garden cities as the way forward for urban life. Mumford's presentation of bioregionalism is ground-breaking - if we had followed the bioregionalist vision in the USA quality of life would have been tremendously enhanced. But some momentum is building for bioregionalism (e.g. Barbara Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life.Mumfords presentation of the history of urban life here is quite good, although his later work The City in History is superior on that front. It is the presentation of bioregionalism that is the special contribution of The Culture of Cities."
3,For the sports enthusiast...,"American Kickboxer is a great movie for sports enthusiasts particularly those into martial arts and boxing. While the soundtrack mostly sucks, the fight scenes jump off the screen. Villian, Brad Morris uses this movie as his vehicle to kick ass."
3,Better than the First,"It was great to finally get a copy of this publication after hearing about it for months. I even went to the book release opening at a gallery here in new York , which really enhanced all that the book was about. Great character designs, 3-D characters, posters, stickers and street art from some of the greats out there like Kaws, Dalek , Esm-artificial and others. The bad part about the book is that there are way too many mediocre artists/designers involved who contribute very little to the overall vibe of this book. i think maybe if it was screened down a little it would be more successful but still it's a cool little publication."
5,Eternal Spirit : eternal listening,"I got this CD when it first came out. One of the best CDs I ever heard.The music is totally unique. Dance with Death is closest Hill CD to it I ever heard.Also somewhat akin to Shades CD with Clifford Jordan. Nice to hear Hill with alto horn.I played this CD relentlessly for at least a month. Couldn't get enough of the haunting, ethereal lilt to the overall sound. The group is totally tight yet free.If you dig Hill, you will love this hard to get CD.Harry Walker"
5,In search of,"The song ""Payaso"" has been my favorite for so many years. The others songs are also beautiful, especially the ballads. Beautiful CD."
5,"Beautiful picture, simple to use","Shipped on time, with delivery into the house. No damage, the driver helped to open it so I could inspect it before signing off on it. The television has a beautiful picture, especially when coupled with an HD signal. The picture is bright, but can be turned down through the on screen controls. The TV remembers the settings for each video input. There are seven video inputs that can be selected. The labels are well marked. The built in speakers are okay, but a TV like this needs a superior sound system to go with the picture."
5,it rulez,"I can't say this is the heavest band's work, but it's such another thing of your attention... If you heard other dismember albums, this is different...really killing album and really great work...buy it...listen it...and die by it...:]"
2,Bad publication of a good book. Pity,"An editorial board (or perhaps it's just the one editor) who can't bother to get the spelling of the TITLE on the COVER PAGE right isn't interested in doing his/her job. I regret getting this edition even though I support what book surge is doing. This is the second book I've gotten on the boorsurge list, and the first (Sara Teasdale's Poetry Collection doesn't even bother have a contents page with proper listing of the poems."
4,Buy the album,"For under $10 you'll listen to it more than once and that's a keeper. I like both Blake's voice and song writing (for those songs he wrote on this album), ability."
5,Brilliant Songs,This is Pure Brilliant Songs - normally you get a CD and really love two or three songs. Not with this one - I love them all - I play it on my commute to work - now I wish I had a longer commute. It is easy to tell that he really feels these songs when he sings them. I can't say enough good things about this CD.
3,Album for Bitter Boys,"I was looking forward to receiving this album. I love ""Barn & Grill"" and I love Blake Shelton. However, this go-round makes it clear that Blake was going through a divorce and the results are a stereotypical country album. I crave an album with an ecletic mix of upbeat tunes and ballads, but this seemed too heavy on the bitter ballads. Cheer up, Blake! Things got better! Put a few songs on the album that I can listen to as I run. Overall it's an okay album, Barn & Grill is better."
4,Pretty Good,"I kinda agree with some of the other reviews on here. It is a very good album, but I think Barn & Grill was slightly better. But I bought this CD as soon as it came out and have played it in my truck many, many times. Also like someone else mentioned, it has a lot of 'bitter love' songs on it, but it's country music and many people can probably relate to it.Out of 11 songs, I love 5 of them, like 4 of them, don't care for 2 of them.I recommend to buy it. Don't pay 20$ for it, but it'd be worth it for 15$ and under."
4,good so far,"Once i got the old pedal off, which took a lot of WD-40 and some pliers, the new one went on easily and is working well. the old one snapped off but it was an old bike so we'll see if the new one ever snaps."
4,Hayes was in a Class all by Himself!,"Great CD! But ""I Stand Accused"" is not the eleven minute original version on the album. It lasts a little more than four minutes on this CD."
5,Simply a great great movie,"I saw this movie enroute to Toronto from London on British Airways. It's quite possibly one of the funniest, and most well done movies. It's a claymation story of Rudolph the Reindeer's son. It's got everything, girls, machismo, cheating, lying, and more girls... I've been looking for this movie on R1 DVD for a long time, and I'm relieved that I found it!"
5,Absolutely Superb Entertainment,"In the true Nick Park/Aardman Animation Style, Robbie the Reindeer is brought to life with gusto! A must see for any claymation fan. I thoroughly enjoyed this video. It is funny, charming, witty and there's even a little romance! A great way to spend half an hour!"
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"You may want to rent this title before the purchase. It is not the traditional Christmas movie. There are mild sexual references and Santa is dressed ""hip"" and throws a dance party. This is not a bad film, just not what I expected for children."
2,Robbie the Reindeer in Hooves of Fire,I think I am little disappointed perhaps because I expected The Wrong Trousers or A Close Shave class of creation. I bought this with the hope that my 2 year old will like it as much as he likes the two Wallace and Gromit adventures. It is apparent that he is not enjoying it as much. Some good punch lines but lacks the drama and tempo which W & G has to offer. The clay work too is fairly crude compared to W & G.
1,"Great poem, poor presentation",The one-star rating is only for the appearance of this edition on the Kindle 2. It is the one available for free from amazon.com. The text is riddled with extraneous characters. None of the delightful drawings are included. One does get what one pays for.
2,Not Complete,This is not a true copy of the Hunting of the Snark. It does not include the wonderful drawings by Henry Holiday. Without these drawings this book is incomplete.
4,Ok book,Not the best Judy blume book but it was not a bad book . Herbie made me want to scream sometimes he was so annoying. The only character I liked was Glenn. I give this book a four out of five and eight out of ten.
2,I feel the anger...,"This book meant to have a moral about treating African-AMericans with respect, and I'm all for that, but the message doesn't come through really well. Even at the end of the book, I still felt bitterness to ""Mrs. Germ"", the lady who was cruel to Glenn, Herbie, and Tina. I got irritated that Tina ruined the picnic that Winnie had so nicely prepared.I was angry at Winnie, though she soon apologized, for hitting Herbie. I really wouldn't recommend this book, especially to African Americans."
2,From an adult's perspective: boring. Too politicly correct,"First of all I have to be honest and write down that I read this book in my current age of 34...so what I write may not be right for someone who is in the right age for this book, but I also write as one who used to love Judie Bloom's books at all times. I find this book too politicly correct, so much trying to be ""correct"" that it isn't interesting, it does not deal with real people. This book is too schematic, with the same stereotyped characters - one ""good"" ""ideal"" family (Iggies's) one ""bad"" family with all the old fashioned ideas and the one in the middle - the writer's family. I did not like this book."
1,Not A Very Good Judy Blume Book,"Iggie's House is a boring book from start to end. It never draws you in, and you never remember what is going on in the story. It is not funny,quirky,dramatic, or social issue type material. This book is so bad, it doesn't even desrerve a 1, more like a -2"
4,Its Dis-tastic,"this game is awsome. You can play as 5 of your favorite disney characters. With Three awsome modeschallenge cupexhibitionpracticeThis also has 14 great! power-ups to help you out, and there you have it tune in for the next inside disney with almore cato."
2,"fair, but not much more","As a woman and a serious boxing enthusiast, I found this movie to be intriguiging, but it's not something I would recommend for most people. The boxing scenes are extremely well done, intermingled with POV fantasy shots of what the boxers are thinking. This really isn't a movie about boxing, but a character study about the female lead played by Lolita Davidovich. The ending is exceptionally disappointing, ruining what little interest the movie generates. Save your pennies for ""Rocky"" or maybe ""Diggstown"" if you're looking for a good boxing movie. But if you're looking for harmless entertainment, try this one."
2,Too long and depressing.,Not really all that great. I barely made it to the end. It's long and has a depressing vibe. I actually bought this movie by mistake. Otherwise I wouldn't even have bothered. I got the title mixed up with another movie.
1,I hate this movie...,"however, I bought it as a gift for a friend (who I saw it with in the theater) who loves it. Shipping was prompt, and the gift was well received."
4,Surprisingly Interesting,"I am not into boxing movies, but Lucy Liu always catch my interest. The next step was Antonio Banderas plus Woody Harrleson, so i said there must be something about this, and it was. Surprisingly interesting as it was not only did it keep my attention span, it brought chuckles as well. The story line portrayed here is something i had never seen before, so it was a plus. I most definately will be watching this one over and over again."
3,america's critic,movie was dull only one good boxing fight really didnt care for this one if u want to watch boxing go watch rocky it makes this look like doodoo
3,pretty good,both woody harrelson and antonio banderas gave great performances in this. i don't understand all the bad reviews. this deserves atleast 3 and a half stars. its pretty funny. very entertaining film. really underrated
2,Just plain boring,"I was really disapointed with this movie. Just a quick overview. Two friends are offered $100,000 to fight each other. They accept. They get a ride. On the way they meet a trampy girl. They get there. They fight. It's over. Lucy Lui plays the trampy girl - horribly. Lolita Davidovich was the only character worth watching. And I like Woody Harrelson. But not in this movie. Antonio Banderas was a whiny boxer. Woody Harrelson was a Christian boxer who sees Jesus occasionally. The first 1 Hour & 15 minutes is the ride to Vegas. Why didn't they just fly? It would have been more enjoyable for the audience. Do Not waste your money on this movie. It is pretty pointlesss."
2,Not Worth Your Time,"Two ex-boxing stars who just happen to be best friends are offered to fight before the featured Mike Tyson fight. They drive to Vegas for the next sixty minutes, filled with dabs of humor or drama that never click. The actual fight is a little entertaining, but not worth the price of admission. No one should watch this; in fact, I'll ruin the ending so you won't have an excuse to view it: a predictable draw. Then they lose their money on the roulette wheel. Fun."
2,Just plain Boring,"Here's the story. Two has been boxers get offered $100,000 to fight each other on the undercard of Mike Tyson. They accept. They get a ride. They pick up a trampy girl. They get to Vegas. They fight. I'll let you figure out the rest.Lolita Davidovich is the only interesting character in this entire movie. Woody Harrelson & Antonio Banderas are just boring. The first 2/3 of theis movie is their drive to Vegas. They pick up Lucy Lui - who is just so annoying. The best part of the movie is when Lolita Davidovich punches her out. The last 1/3 of this movie is decent. It's the fight. Although it is plagued with images of naked women...why - we don't know - it's still semi-interesting.The ending is just so predictable. I don't even need to elaborate on it. Don't waste your money buying or renting this one. Wait for it to come out on cable."
3,Not as funny as it looked,"This is about two guys who'll do almost anything for money, including beating each other up. When a high profile boxing event loses its undercard, sparring buddies step into the ring."
3,Fast Forward to last 50 minutes,"At the beginning of this movie I was wide-awake but about 45 mins into the movie I could feel myself falling asleep. This movie doesn't really do anything for me until the last 50 mins. But before that all it is is a boring road trip that last forever and isn't funny. I loved the boxing scenes b/c they were brutal and it reminded me of Rocky and Raging Bull. I kinda predicted the outcome of the match halfway into the fight but it was still fun watching them beat each other up. If you love Banderas and Harrelson then you might like this movie more than I do, but if u don't, don't see it. Last words, I wouldn't buy it."
3,Not a Knock Out!,"The fight scenes in this moive were very good but the lack of action and the boring drive to the fight made this film not as good as it could have been. Boxing fans will recognize lots of big named extras at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where the big fight scene takes palce. I enjoyed the soundtrack very much too.This movie was a good rental but nothing you would want to watch a second time or own."
2,Comedy Blended With Action Works Out in this film,"Antonio Banderas & Woody Harelson Play well against one another in a very funny and poignent film about friendship and the competive nature of professinal Boxing. Ceaser and Vince are two down on their luck prizefighters who get a chance of a lifetime to win $100.00 dollers in a highly publiced match problem is its agasint one another. True friendship is tested when their on the road together. Great lines delivered from Banderas & Harrelson, these two are cast well in their roles. The Director Ron Shelton who made sport-comedies in the past has scored again with 'PLAY IT TO THE BONE' And it was much more funnier than TIN CUP Back in 1996."
3,One question to Mr. Shelton...,"...""What happened?"" I mean, this is the man that gave us ""White Men Can't Jump"" and ""Bull Durham."" The ending was ludicrous. Shelton isn't known for taking the easy way out in his movies. Still, it's worth 3 stars: one apiece for Lolita Davidovich and Lucy Liu, and one for the spectacular camera work in the fight between Harrelson and Banderas."
1,Why did this movie get made?,"With this movie being as bad as it was it is no surprise that it was only in theaters for about a week. Woody was way out of the caliber of performances that we all know that he can do. Antonio was about the same in this movie as he has been in all of his other pahtetic films. Lucy Liu may be attractive, but it is not worth having to watch this attrocious film just for her."
5,Best Book Ever!!,I read this for a book report and I loved it! It was filled with action. Mandy and James find a sheepdog! They name it Tess. The y get someone to take it. I wanted to read the whole series because of it! I loved it!
1,This book is boring,I didnt like this book because it was boring. If you would of read it you would of regreted it. this book is about a girl that made a party for pets. How stupid is that. The pets would destroy all the furniture. I rated it 1 star because it had no pictures.
5,Celia Cruz is the Queen!!,"I've liked Celia from the very first time that i heard her. I didnt even speak Spanish but loved her voice. If you love salsa music, the way it was meant to be played, then you'll love this CD."
5,Must read!!!,"Find a comfortable place to read this book and prepare yourself for an enjoyable, yet thought provoking time. The great short story writers know how to illustrate the profundity of the moment through their skills at understanding the human experience. Nate Liederbach demonstrates this skill well, for his sense of humor as well as his acute observation of his own thoughts and ours, shines through in his writing. To not have read this collection of short stories is to miss out on an adventure of laughs and pauses for contemplation."
4,I was born in 1988,"When in the music store my friend and I were attracted by the sweater the lead singer (Well, I presume he is) was wearing... We asked if we could listen the record and when I had heared I immediately knew this would be a new fav!Maybe it takes some time to get used to the music these Canadians make, especially when you're used to listening to Britpop records such as Franz Ferdinand and Arctic Monkeys.My personal fav is '1988', but that's 'coz I was born in 1988, o'course."
5,Finally a Haba product for ME!,"Our kids get most the Haba stuff in our family, but my kids got this Haba keychain for me. It has beads that would be too small for little ones, but what really little people have real keys anyway? It's a gorgeous beaded, felted keychain."
3,Good for straight surfing,I used to go to a bar years ago that showed nothing but surf footage all day. This is the closest i've come to that yet. A little short but a great video nonetheless for those who enjoy surfing videos without all the commentary.
5,Great,This was just what I expected and arrived quickly. Cologne can be hard to reorder after years. My husband was happy Christmas morning
3,A mixed bag that borrows an interesting concept,"Director John McNaughton followed up his unbelievably scary and realistic debut film ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" with this mixed bag mixture of horror and science fiction. The movie borrows its concept from the superior film ""The Hidden"" in which an alien on earth jumps from body to body, killing its victims in the process. The concept itself is interesting and the movie shows some promise and some humor early on. Ultimately, however, McNaughton loses his way toward the end and it becomes just another low budget horror flick. ""The Hidden"" remains the best movie based on this particluar concept."
3,Just OK,The chocoloates were very tastey but the size of the basket was much smaller than anticipated.
3,Emanuel Contracts,"It took an extremely long time for the book to arrive. The seller claimed it was the mail service it uses. Nevertheless, the seller is in direct control of that so the onus falls to the seller. I purchased the book because the proceeds go to charity. However, I still expected prompt delivery of my item. It took at least two weeks from the date of purchase to receive my book. It arrived just in time for me to start studying for my finals."
5,Great Last minute Review,"if you need a quick lifesaver and a way to sort out a mess of notes at the end of the semester, then this book is for you!"
4,Contracts,My emanuel came right in time to help me with my Friday class. I really enjoy the explanations and examples given. I would recommend this service to anyone who needs a little help understanding contracts.
4,Crunch time : Contracts,"This was such a helpful review. It brings all the information necessary into prespective and focuses on what's important. I highly recommend this guide and others in the series. It's like a good workbook, without all the intensity of a contracts text book. This book gets an A+++"
3,Could Be Useful,"I used this book to prepare for my Contracts exam in law school. The book gives plenty of examples. The explanations are short and easy to understand. However, the book fails to provide the big picture. The reader could get lost in the myriad examples yet the common thread seems elusive."
2,Just Okay,There is too much in this book to help in preparing your outline. There are other study aids which give better examples or explanations.
5,Law School,"Purchased this for my daughter for 1st year law school exam review. She said it was a ""great aid"" for contracts exam."
4,"Competently written, clear, and on target","I have found this book to be helpful in preparing foreign lawyers for the New York Bar Exam. The format is clean and straightforward. The author uses examples and hypotheticals effectively. In brief, the book is a very useful tool for bar exam preparation. I recommend it."
3,"Sharp edge, blade too thick. Get a Mac knife!","The top edge of the blade is too thick, so you often need two hands to slice things. The cutting edge sharpness seems fine, but it's too heavy and the balance is not quite right (blade heavy). After using the Mac knife, I'm spoiled. Spend the extra money (not much!) and get the Mac knife which is a top quality knife and the best value on the market right now. It's in a different league."
2,NAH......DON'T LIKE,"NOW I LIKE LOTS OF BOY BANDS (NSYNC,98 DEGRESS,WESTLIFE YOU GET THE PICTURE) BUT 3 BELOW....WELL I DON'T LIKE. WITH THE FIRST SINGLE ""FALLING"" IT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR VOICE IS FALLING.AND ""STAIGHT UP"" SOUNDS LIKE A REMAKE FROM NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK. 3 BELOW WON'T GO FAR IN THE MUSIC LAND. THEY JUST DON'T GOT IT (THE LOOKS,THE DANCING,THE VOICE.)REALLY THEY DON'T GOT IT."
2,What the [...]?,"[...] I mean atleast you could actually hear the sound and wouldent have to hear this weak ass stuff man these guys made a huge mistake trying to make it in the music biz this is the only thing they have prolly ever recorded because someone was high or drunk and didnt kno what they were doing hey guys find something else to do and if you bought this single you were either drunk,high under hostage or crazy as hell if you had any since u would flush this crap of so called ""music down the toilet"" This is pure Garbage so put it back were it belongs. good job guys you made alot of people waste their time and / or money on this pathetic attempt at...Music Ha Ha Ha Ha This Blows Big Time!"
4,One of the best sources for understanding Confucius,"As an undergraduate and graduate student I have read this book a total of at least five times. Each time, I am impressed by how clearly Fingarette clarifies the important fundamentals of Confucianism that we often forget in our attempt to exoticize this central Chinese philosopher. A short, easy to read book, it ranks with Waley's ""Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China"" as one of the first important texts to read to understand Chinese philosophy."
3,Way too much hype,"There is a lot of hype around Triumph of the Will, and the way you hear about it, you expect some kind of horror. Sure, Hitler's up to his usual screaming fits, but it's all relatively tame. The Nazi esthetic - like the shots of people from below and at an angle, to make them look brave and tall, or the abundant flags - really comes to the fore in this movie, but the content is relatively banal. If you've seen one parade of tens of thousands of bureaucrats or soldiers (in the Nazi party, the distinction was somewhat blurred), you've seen them all. There is a particularly bizarre part where fanatic-looking agricultural workers do a little theater for Hitler, which brings much levity, at least to the modern viewer. I imagine a German from the thirties would have found it stirring. AS for me, I amused myself every time Hess came to the screen by saying ""what, you're not gone yet ?""."
4,If only to understand...,"I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" for the general public. First, it's black & white & the unwashed masses will start fiddling with the TV/remote controls to correct the ""mistake"". Second, it has subtitles; need I say more? Third, our viewing tastes have been molded by Hollywood over the years & the filming style of the 1930s will appear stilted & boring (see earlier ""review""). Fourth, it's history...I would strongly recommend this film for the serious student. There is truth in the old saying: Seek and ye shall find. Serious students learn not by the repetition of dry facts but by understanding causes & effects.PS: Reviewer Thomas M. Seay is a pinhead."
1,triumph of the will,the picture on this DVD is beyond horrible. i'm shocked that they would even attempt to sell something this flawed. on most of it you haven't a clue what it is your watching. mark lombardi reno
4,Creepy but instructional look into a thankfully vanished world,"For most of her life Riefenstahl denied being a Nazi sympathizer, but this movie makes a hard argument against that claim. It's interesting now to see a film where the Nazis are so flatteringly portrayed, and Hitler is displayed with almost god-like status (he descends from the clouds in the beginning, which must have been rare to see in the mid-30s, as few had flown then). The movie sometimes drags as we watch the speeches of minor party officials, but the spectacle never fails to impress and horrify. Instructional on a number of levels."
5,Evil in a beautiful guise,"It makes one a touch nervous getting anything by the Nazis, but Leni Riefenstahl is a genius filmmaker. Unlike shallow propaganda, her work gets in your head, a precursor to filmmakers like Scorcese et al.And, btw, The Bible and Mein Kampf have nothing in common!The son of a Dachau liberator."
5,Triumph of the Will,This movie was fantastic! It highlights what the nazis and Hitler were really like. Hitler cast a spell on me and his speeches were absoloutly mesmerizing. When you watch this be prepared to witness history as you take in breathtaking scenes of the power this man had on his nation. Truly a masterpiece and in my opinion the greatest movie of all time.
1,Stolen property! Bootleg! Horrible quality!,"This download, brought to Amazon through the auspices of Triad Productions of Southgate, MI IS A BOOTLEG.Quality if horrific, and it is also missing the final fifteen minutes of the film.Triad Productions is a limited liability Michigan company, licensed by the state with an ID number of E0007N.This is stolen property."
1,Total ripoff - avoid!,"The quality of this transfer is bad beyond belief - no one could be expected to watch such blurry, weak images for more than ten minutes. I have to assume that the authors of the four positive reviews either watched another film or work for the outfit (identified only as ""PD Productions"") that is marketing this ripoff.Fortunately, I held onto the VHS version of this classic that I bought 10-12 years ago - it's good enough, but not optimal; and so I was hoping a dvd would mean an improvement. Instead, it's in the trash and I'm out $13."
3,"Oh Leni, you're so fine!","Directed by Leni Riefenstahl, this is a cinematic document of the 1934 rally at Nuremburg. Everyone who reviews the film says that, all politics aside, the artistry is breathtaking. And I agree: if you buy one piece of Nazi propaganda in your lifetime, you should definitely make it Triumph. But if you can, watch it on a double bill with Schindler's List or The Pianist so you know you're getting both sides of the story.Though this is obviously very old footage, the DVD transfer of both the audio and visuals is astonishing in its clarity. In fact, it was so vivid, when the pizza man knocked on my door during the opening credits, I nearly hid in the basement.Again, there's no denying the technical brilliance of this film, but a movie designed to promote the Hitler agenda will never get the gold star of excellence from me.Happy viewing!"
3,Great Documentary Film,"This film is about the Nuremberg rally in 1934 in which Hitler flies into town, the speeches, and the parades. It was produced FOR Hitler, so it's a propaganda film. It begins with Hitler flying in to an airport, and follows a motorcade lined with cheering, adoring Germans, as Hitler is driven to his hotel. In scene after scene, we see Hitler making speeches, reviewing the SA, the SS, field workers carrying shovels, Hitler's Youth Brigades, and torch light parades. The film is in B&W; and has been restored. Video is quite good. Sound is OK.Since my initial review, I watched Lina being interviewed. She won an award for this film, but she regretted doing it. She was not political, she was an actress. Hitler implored her to do this film, and she did no others for the Nazi party."
5,Society of the Spectacle,"A ""MUST"" for those who want to study the modern history of the spectacle and how it gained primacy over the real. An interesting study would be to compare this film with the speech that Bush gave to Congress following 9/11. There is an uncanny resemblance."
1,Triumph of the Will,"Remastered from what? This version of Triumph of the Will (PD productions) is completely unwatchable. the sound is distorted, the picture is cropped and pixelated. Do not purchase this version!"
4,Government Documentary,Good quality footage. After watching it I saw where a lot of footage for other movies and documentaries came from. I couldn't help but wonder if some inspiration didn't come from DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation. I thought the story line was a bit jerky and hard to follow. But the purpose of the film was inspire not inform. I wonder if Spielberg is working on Dreams of my Father.
2,Triumph of th.........,"Although EMBASSY videotapes were always of fine quality, functioned well and were dubbed at SP speed, their edition of TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is not the one to buy due to over a half-hour of footage being edited out. Correct running time is 114 minutes, not 80.TheTIMELESS MULTIMEDIAtape runs 107 minutes.MERIDAN VIDEO CORP's edition is 112 minutes....and so on..."
3,Through The Looking Glass Darkly,"I had been hearing about this film and Leni Riefenstahl every now and then for over a decade and I finally decided that I had to see what all the fuss was about. Some of the scenes are interesting and some of the scenes are a little scary. But the long parts showing the parades are, after a while, kind of boring. Still the film generally has a unique character and a way of drawing one back into the terrifying atmosphere and ambience of that period of history - sort of like a reminder of where the world would be better not to ever go again."
5,"Beautiful, iconic, terrifying","When I first saw Triumph of the Will in the late 80's, it struck me deeply both as a film student and as a Jew. I still struggle, as have many others, to understand how Germans were so utterly swept away by Nazi fervor. You can read endless books trying to climb inside what seems like an alien psychology from musty decades past, and then there is the electrifying power imprisoned in Triumph of the Will. In an inverted way the film reminds me of Raiders of the Lost Ark: an ancient relic that contains a dormant, still-vital force. This one is reawakened by the simple act of running it through a projector. To feel and not merely see that reflected glory, even decades later in a different society, is Riefenstahl's genius. Damn it, it IS beautiful. And terrible."
5,One of History's Horrible Lessons,"The fact that a ""nobody"" like Adolf Hitler rose to such power is frightening enough, but thanks to this film we have a recorded history that helps explain WHY. Riefenstahl's glorious filmmaking technique depicts the savagely seductive power of the Fuhrer over the people of Germany and is an important piece of history to help remind us ""never to forget"" and, especially, to not let it happen again."
4,A Natzi propaganda film,"Historically important as a propaganda piece. It centers on a Natzi convention.Cheering crowds, flag waving, and parades. All made to impress."
3,Good Look into the Nazi mind,"Because of my personal beleifs against what this film stands for (as is the case with Birth of a Nation), I cannot give it more stars than this.However, one cannot deny that this is brilliant propaganda. One can see how Germans of the 30s and others who were ignorant of what Hitler really stood for could be suckered by this film. There are no anti-semetic messages (or any mention of Jews for that matter), no scenes of violence, no concentration camps, etc. anywhere in sight. Basically, just an orderly nation at work who happily greets it's ""leader."" The basic message that the unthinking mind gets from this film is ""Say It Loud, I'm German and Proud.""This film is a prime example of why people need to cross-reference what they see. Those who are ignorant of true history and accepts this as the sole point of view will continue the disease of facism."
2,Of historical interest only,"Given the machinations of modern-day advertising, it is difficult to place oneself back in the 1940s and to try to understand why this film was ever considered to be the height of sophistication in propaganda. I suspect that the desire to claim victory over an evil and highly dangerous enemy after the war had a great deal to do with it.Leni Riefenstahl has a great reputation as a film maker of propaganda, but so does Eisenstein, and Eisenstein did it twenty years earlier. Today's viewer is still overwhelmed by Eisenstein's genius, while Leni Riefenstahl's work is dated and often silly."
1,DOMESTIC BOOTLEG!!!,This DVD is a DOMESTIC BOOTLEG copied from a VHS tape.Horrible quality and illegal!
1,My copy a dud,Having first seen this film at university twenty years ago I was really looking forward to watching this scary but masterful political propaganda film once again but my copy was a dud. About 70 minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies. The images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued. Then the sound froze. I had to keep fast forwarding to get through the glitches. QA could not have been to rigorous. The digital reproduction on the DVD is poor at this point and this continues throughout the whole of the SS review.I'll be asking for my money back.
2,The GOP's film of reference for 2012,"If you want to know how the Republicans would like to see the United States, look no further than this film. It is a beautifully cinematic depiction of the worst regime in world history, and today's Republicans are all too eager to repeat it--not just by gassing Jews, but anyone else with whom they disagree."
1,Overrated,"One can only wonder if the other reviewers actually watched this film, or if they were simply mesmerized by Riefenstahl's reputation for ""genius"" and the film's ""influence."" Aside from a few remarkable scenes (the scenes everyone is familiar with, even if they don't know the filmmaker's name), and the lurid subject, the film is virtually unwatchable. Like many big-budget, modern studio creations, the trailer is the best part, and seeing it in its entirety can only detract from the power of ""those"" scenes. No film of which the trailer is better than the whole can be a great film, and no filmmaker can be called ""great"" based on a few minutes of stunning footage in an expanse of ennui."
2,Jim Freyer - A college student,I was forced to watch this movie in my Film Communications Class. I gave it a 2 star rating because I stayed awake for over 10 minutes. I think you get the Idea of how I like it. But if you have a lot of time to waste and you want to watch a very very boring movie then I would still suggest that you watch a different movie.
3,Do we need a 'special edition',"Do we really need a special edition of this film that glorifies fascism and hate? Perhaps for the neo-nazi we do, but certainly the general public doesn't need this, the original edition is the same and will do. Its upsetting to see how much people spend to revive things like this, almost as if they dream that the 1000 Year reich will return. A chilling film, very real, a document of the nazi years.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,2 hours of stock footage,"I sat down to watch this movie completly objectivly. I don't let personal disagreements get in the way of appreciating good music and movies, but this was just a boring movie. It's just another propaganda film made by a beginning director. I almost turned it off after the first 15 minutes, but i decided i would give it the benefit of the doubt and sit through the entire 2 hours which ended up just being a waste of my time. I could have just watched the music video for depeche mode's 'people are people' 22 times, but then again, i would have missed out on the pudgy housewives throwing gang signs and the homoerotic scenes with Hitler's youth.I consider myself to be a film snob, but i just don't understand this one."
3,Some parts are boring,"I think I can't tell that it's a must see...But still interesting..Especially youth camps, everybody's support, the will of the people...I wonder if any politician can fulfill a stadium today with people all supporting him very eagerly and devoted....That was the most striking point in my opinion"
5,Excellent commentary,The commentary from the history professor contained in the special features was excellent. It added a new dimension to the spectacle as it explained the background to what was being viewed as as well as interesting information as to what happened to the sinister characters that were being displayed on the screen.
5,A Landmark Film,"Many people assume that Nazism somehow illegally took power in Germany during the 1930s. This masterpiece, the greatest propaganda film ever made, utterly destroys that notion. The hypnotic and euphoric hold that National Socialism, and in particular the charismatic nature of Hitler himself, held over the German people is blazingly illustrated by Riefenstahl (herself, a groundbreaking pioneer for female filmakers). Pay particular attention to the speeches, both large and small. Notice the reaction of the people and compare that to a modern day rock concert. There is virtually no difference."
5,Propoganda at it's very best,"This is the most skillfully done propaganda previous to Michael Moore's Farenheit 911. The techniques employed to present you with undeniably accurate film and at the same time to make you see and feel what Riefenstahl wants you to, are way before their time. No wonder Goebbels felt threatened by her skill."
5,Simply put - an essential film.,"Just in terms of technical camera use this is one of the great films.Masterful. The National Socialist propaganda film used toconvince the German people to go along with the madness.Anyone who watches any network news should be required to watchthis film. That's pretty much all of us. Watching this film withthe foreknowledge that of what resulted, gives us all a betterunderstanding of what government, any goverment, can do and doesto its people. Popular emotion and beliefs can be and are managedthrough the media. Gosh, maybe even here in America."
1,Not good over the long haul . . . or even the short haul!,"Bought December 2003. Picture washed out from day one but good enough for a dark kitchen. Remote began having issues in 2005 - died soon after. This year (2007) the unit stopped tuning in cable channels and there is not way to change to CATV (like it used to do). Hitting the TV/Video button cycles through Video 1, Video 2 and TV but that is all. Now, channels above 13 are gone completely (even using an antennae). I should never have put up with the picture in the first place. I don't recommend this unit!"
3,"Very handy, but too small.","The screen size is a bit too small. Either a 7"", or a 9"" would be perfect. Also, if you arn't looking directly at the screen, it is hard to see the picture. If you are looking down or up at the screen, it comes out either all black or all white, because it is a flat-screen TV.Very handy, portable. You can lift up the screen, and tuck it out of the way when it isn't in use. Works great in the kitchen, but don't expect to sit down and watch TV. Only practicle for those who listen to TV more than they watch it."
4,Perfect for the kitchen,"This is the perfect little tv for under-counter use.The quality of picture is amazing and the remote is user friendly.The only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the screen needs to be just a little bit bigger,7 inches would be great.The tv is still worth it!"
4,"Great Set, but where's the security camera?","I am totally happy with the picture quality. I have it set up between my computer moniter and tower and watch it while doing mindless work at the keyboard (like right now) so the viewing angle is fairly constant. Because of a limited viewable angle, it could be a bit of a problem in the kitchen where you are moving around.My only serious gripe: there seems to be no way to aquire the optional security camera, which was one of its nicest selling points (its listed on the box). I have even emailed Audiovox with no response. Judging from the products listed on Audiovox's website, this TV and all accessories have been discontinued, so beware. I'm still glad I got it. ..."
3,"Cheap, but narrow viewing angle","Bought it for the kitchen but returned it. Like the 1st in-flight movie screens, the viewing angle's narrow...the picture turns into a photographic negative if you're not centered in front of the screen."
5,PERFECT FOR WORKING IN KITCHEN,"My husband just installed this little gem for me this weekend and I love it! For working around the kitchen it is perfect. It is connected to our satellite system and VCR and the picture could not be more crystal. Many times I listen more than watch a show, but to have the picture to glance at occasionally is a real plus. Wish I had thought of this sooner!"
1,A total waste of money,"This book just came in the mail. I purchased it brand new! The first 20 pages have words listed in alphabetical order. That's it. No definitions, contexts, synonyms, antonyms or anything else. The words are simple, as if the author went to a dictionary and arbitrarily chose simple words to write a book and then wrote ""acquitted, acquired, diagnosed, diced, and dictated, etc."" Then to add salt to the wound, every other language under the sun takes up the other 140 pages or so: Spanish, Hebrew, French, Italian, German and Portuguese. What a total, total waste of money. Great title but a real disappointment."
1,Critique the ideas,"Not really interested in Moore and how he manipulates the subject to meet his desired outcomes. At the end of the day his objectors need to answer his criticisms of American policy.They cant because gun control , universal medical care , workers rights ,the lack of WMD in Iraq,the Wall street created the global recession but didnt have to carry the cost scenario, you did are points accepted all around the globe in advanced democracies except one .The United States.Wake up America you have been sold a lemon.Increasing the gap between the poor and the wealthy will ultimately cost your society a price that you cant afford. Don't belive the BS. Michael Moore the person is irrelevant. Only the argument counts."
2,Could Have Done a Much Better Job,"I am not a MM fan. I absolutely disagree with his methods. If you are going to edit your ""documentary"" to bend the truth (or outright lie), then don't call it a documentary. Hollywood is showing its true colors by giving him awards in documentary categories.I don't know if I agree with his politics or not. With all of his lies and extremism, I really don't know what he stands for, other than making money.As far as this film is concerned, it really only scratches the surface in challenging his films. They would have been better off focusing more on his film inaccuracies. We don't need another documentary (on top of MM Hates America) that focuses on someone not being able to get an interview with him. They didn't even really touch F 911."
3,They used a clip from my film.,"I think it's a 2 star film, but I give Manufacturing Dissent 3 stars because they used a clip from my film ""This Divided State"" in it.Other than that, it was ok I guess. I liked ""Michael Moore Hates America"" better.I'm generally a pro-Moore viewer and I really liked ""SiCKO"", but I don't think ""Bowling For Columbine"" deserved an Oscar. ""Capturing the Friedmans"" was the best documentary that year. But, I digress.Manufacturing Dissent brought up some good points along the way and I agree with them, it just didn't do it in an engaging way."
1,"Interesting, but in the end a FAILURE!","I didn't liked this documentary! If you want to see a real interesting anti-Michael Moore documentary watch Michael Moore Hates America.I though that Manufacturing Dissent was about criticizing the movie Sicko but I was wrong, this is more about criticizing Michael Moore's manipulations with his pros and cons.What many people doesn't realize is that WE DON'T CARE whenever Michael Moore exaggerate or not! His points of view are TRUTH!!! The war in Irak IS WRONG!! People NEED Universal Heathcare! People doesn't need to buy SUPER MACHINE GUNS to defend themselves from thiefs!People shouldn't say that what Michael Moore says is senseless because is NOT!!! IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE! Is up to us to believe him or not, but is NOT senseless.P.S: Im not saying that I support Michael Moore in every way because there are MANY things that I disagree with him but I don't think of him as an enemy.Adios."
3,Credit for trying,"For those who review here, it is a review, not a critique.It is a simple book that has what the reader is expected to be truths, just like Michaels books and movies; these are money making vehicles for publishers and Moore and this guy made them some money. Relax and use this to spark your own research and then you will see just how hard it is to evaluate almost any real issues."
3,Manufacturing Dissent.,"This Documentary presents a more ""fair"" look at MM,whatever that means. He doesn't deserve a Fair nothing. What he has done,his methods and deceit to justify his means has already been covered in Michael Moore Hates America(A Much superior film than this.)To give time to see anything michael moore related is too waste one's time. he doesn't represent the little guy,only the liberal establishment.he is in desperate need of help.If he represents the Left in this country I feel sorry for them."
1,Manufacturing Decent,"Michael Moore has never done anything that hasn't been manufactured, so the title is perfect.. He has no actual concept of what the truth is on any issue he has ever explored on film. So, if you enjoy his far fetched fiction,buy it. If not, it will just tend to annoy you,so don't waste your time and money."
4,Economic anthropology at its best,"In this short text (it's officially known as a ""pamphlet,"" rather in the tradition of Tom Paine), Keith Hart challenges us to rethink much of what we know about contemporary economics and social relations. The six brief chapters of the text's body treat different themes, covering topics as diverse as recent Bollywood films and the expansion of ""intellectual property."" Yet the entire work hangs together very well because the author structures it around a core question: What are the consequences of the supposed divide between economic motivations and social considerations?The only quibble I have with HIT MAN'S DILEMMA is that much of it is lifted from Hart's much longer earlier work, MONEY IN AN UNEQUAL WORLD (2001). If this pamphlet-length treatment leaves you wanting more, you should by all means delve into the other book. If you've already read MONEY, however, you won't find much new in HIT MAN'S DILEMMA."
1,Conflict Based view of the Ego,"This presents a rather outmoded view of the ego as the enemy; rather than as a ""mechanism""whereby consciousness is able to focus on the external senses and external reality (i.e the world). Accordingly, where consciousness also focuses on the internal senses and reality, and with the awareness of the multidimensional nature of reality and of the self - the ego is perceived as one (quite useful) aspect of consciousness. Damning the ego feeds the illusion of conflict at the very core of one's self. This illusion may feel true due to information primarily perceived and cognized via the external senses - but this is not the ""fault"" of the ego. For non-conflict based explorations of the psyche read Jane Roberts, J Krishnamurti, Ken Wilber, or search ""multidimensionality"". Regarding Sai Baba, the reader is referred to the Neural Surfer where Sai Baba, and other spiritual leaders, teachings and lives are explored and scrutinized."
3,Not bad; good for cooking and matching world cuisines,"this book was alright, and has been useful for creating vegetarian menus from different countries and cultures. recipes are alright, but be aware they are in ""metric"" amounts. the book is British-authored."
4,Good Idea,"This movie was a good idea. There are a lot of people who have very limited knowledge of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This is neither pro nor con; just lots of interviews and opinions, some of them silly. Wish there had been a little more information given out, but the reason for the film was to find out what was known, not preach."
2,Not fun to view more than once,This DVD is extremely short and the things said are not very original or that funny. I was disappointed.
3,I wish I'd rented it first,"This wasn't as funny as I was hoping it was going to be, but it was worth watching once. I wish that I had rented it first, because I wouldn't have bought it."
3,American Mormon buyer,"This was Okay. I wouldn't buy it to have the little kids watch because it's just too boring for them. It was funny, just wasn't what I expected. Maybe others will enjoy it, my opinion after all is only my opinion."
4,A taste.,This book gives you a taste of environmentally friendly architecture from all over the world. Learn about the new earth friendly technology and rediscover old but superior ways of building. It feels like I am reading a few of my other books all put together in one but with some stuff left out. Could use some more photo's but other wise it was a nice educational read.
3,Feels weak,"Feels weaker than,The House of the Spirits, Of Love and Shadows, Paula. I think this feeling is rooted in the fact the setting is a result of research and not experience."
1,Historical Revisionism,"What a waste of time.You certainly can't accuse this novel of following slavishly to the rules of unity of time place and action. It is ripped in half, two stories, one a little fuller in Chile, a second more scattered and heavy handed in Gold Rush California.And what a heavy hand. I am SO tired of revisionist historical novels. I am tired of prior century feminists, feminist men, and general fighters against oppression who always sound much more like they come out of the end of the 20th century than from the time that they are being placed in. This is one more novel of the ilk."
3,creative term paper,"This could be a very creative term paper about the history of CA Gold Rush, racial situations, sexual mores,moral codes, aristocrocy hanging on for dear life in fast changing world of values, etc. A good read. If you have not read LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE by Laura Esquirel - go for that as it has some of the same flavors and romances of peoples. This reminds me of that and I will reread it - perhaps will understand LIKE WATER FOR...now."
2,MAGIC IS GONE,If you are a fan of the magic and creativity of Eva Luna then this B-/C+ romance novel will be a big disappointment. This is nothing more than an average romance novel with poor character development and the usual unbelievable circumstances.
1,Not worth the time,"I would just like to warn people to stay away from this book. It doesn't even deserve one star...I normally like Allende, especially her short story 'And of Clay We Are Created,' but this book was predictable, boring, and incredibly long-winded. What really irritated me was that after wading through all of the romantic muck and life-changing revelations, it doesn't even have a good ending! It's like she got tired of the book (can't blame her there--if it was that tedious to read it, I can't imagine what it was like to actually WRITE it), so she tacked on a chapter that could be miscontrued as a conclusion. There are many much better coming of age stories out there, not to mention better stories by Allende, so DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. ..."
1,Can books be returned for refund?,"By the review on the inside of the flaps, the story line looked like something I would have enjoyed, had Ms. Allende been a better writer, & I was able to get past page 58. I've always finished a book even if I didn't like it much, but this one was BAD, sorry to say. It lacks emotion, descriptions, finesse, there is no character development, and the story jumps around, even telling what'll happen later in the book.... The 58 pages made feel like I was looking at the flashing disco lights for hours... I had to stop! She is simply not a storyteller. 1 Star for trying."
3,Not up to standard,"I have enjoyed Isabel Allende's books for many years from the magical realism of ""House of the Spirits"" and ""Eva Luna"" to the biographical ""Paula"". This book doesn't measure up. Characters change their personalities with no explanation; ""secrets"" are so foreshadowed they are boring when finally revealed; and the writer appears to get tired of the story and wraps it up very abruptly.Skip this one and try an earlier Allende book."
2,Daughter of Fortune,"This book was about conditions during the California gold rush and not about a young girl looking for her love. Many characters were introduced and dropped, the reader had to come up with their own conclusion. To many lose ends. The author went over and over the same areas involving views of immigrants and miners during the gold rush and got boring after a while. I was very disappointed in the last part of the book. When I finally realized I wasn't going to be rewarded at the end of the book I just skimmed the last 40 pages. Waste of my time. I didn't take any of the characters with me. Every character was a stereo type of their culture and ethnic group."
2,Disappointing,"Having loved the brilliant House of the Spirits and Eva Luna, imagine my disappointment at this shallow and predictable book. Yes it's infinitely readable, but that doesn't make it good. Allende needs to spend a little more time developing deeper characters, and plot contrivances that aren't so ridiculously apparent miles before they happen."
5,Why did I wait so long?,"I did not read this book as soon as I bought it because of the reviews I read. I finally picked it up to take on a trip with me. I opened it on the plane and I was enthralled from page one. Not only is this book a history lesson it is a wonderful story of true love. I felt so touched by the struggles the characters went through just to survive. I loved most the fact that true love was found in a way that was not typical and that the love was based on all things good, pure and not what society puts upon us. I have passed this book on to a friend who is relishing such a beautifully written and expressed story. I can not wait for her next book. This is the first Oprah book I have given 5 stars."
2,not as good as previous work,"This book is entertaining, but is definitely not Allende's best work. There's really not much to say about the ending. I recommend that you read some of her earlier novels, like ""Eva Luna"" which is excellent."
3,"Love Allende's prose and descriptions, but not so much the story","I read the House of the Spirits a year ago and enjoyed it very much. A friend suggested IDaughter of Fortune to me, and so I bought a copy and finished it in four days.I always love Allende's voice and the way she describes scenes. They are vivid and memorable. The story seems a little far-fetch to me, not completely believable."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this novel. It has so many elements that I like (strong female protagonist, historical setting, people from different cultures interacting, California), I thought it was a sure thing. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. The characters were boring and felt stiff and unreal. I just could not bring myself to care about them. There were also some costume anachronisms that, while not a huge deal, were annoying because they disrupted the mood of the historical setting."
2,Very disappointed - not believable and a weak ending,"I expected to really like this book because I have never read a book by a Chilean writer and Allende is supposed to be so good. But I was disappointed. The plot seemed weak - the main character has a short affair with a man and then searches for him all over the west coast for years. She starts by going from Chili to California in the cargo hold of a ship. Then she goes in cognito for years, all the time looking for him. Finally, at the end the author seems to get bored and ends it quickly. It is weak and appears to be thrown together. This was the monthly read for the book club and most of the other women seemed to like it but I thought that it was a bit of a waste. I did learn a bit about the environment of California during the god rush but I think I could have learned about that without reading the almost 400 pages."
3,Just Okay,"I was disappointed with this book. While I did finish, it was a struggle to do so. The middle was tedious, and while I enjoy historical fiction, much of the details added had little to do with the central story line. Like another reviewer, I felt that the book ended just when it was starting to get interesting and that the relationship between Tao and Eliza could have been expanded. Maybe I will try one of the author's earlier books!"
4,BRAVO!,"Isabel Allende, strikes an immediate chord to a family 'putting on airs' yet, within the house having its problems. It hit home for me and will most likely hit home for many others because we know of families that seem perfect.... and often we find out much later what was truly happening."
4,A Wonderful Book,Do not be dissuaded from reading this book because some may say that it is not the authors' best. It is an extremely well written and entertaining story. It will provide you with hours of adventure as well as fascinating information about the customs and culture of Chile and Northern California in the mid 1800's. It is bright and creative. Read it!
4,Ambitious,"This was an ambitious piece of work, that left me feeling glad I had read it, but slightly disappointed. The main character was spiritful and well developed, but her mission in life was questionable. Allende let us know from the beginning that Eliza's lover was really a bad guy, but it took too long for Eliza to come to that conclusion. I liked the little surprises in the story, but what was truly fascinating was Eliza's role as a mute Chinaman. The experience was greatly liberating and allowed her more freedoms than she would have ever guessed.Definitely a well thought out plot, and well written, but lacking that little extra something that takes a book to a higher level."
4,A Fortunate Find.!,"I normally do not set out to read ""Oprah's Book Club"" picks but I was intrigued to read a book about Chile because my sister-in-law is of Chilean descent. I enjoyed this book more than any other in quite a while,it has believable characters that are very well-written,especially Tao!I enjoyed the descriptions of of both 19th century Chile and the Gold Rush,better than the dry,boring textbooks of grade school. It does get a bit contrived at times,However I really recommend this book too,(with thanks to Oprah..!)"
3,GOOD STORY BUT WRITING WORRIED ME AT TIMES,"I loved the story but at times I found the writing a little 'simple'. Having just read 'Le Testament Francais' (in English) and even the translation was beautifully poetic, I found Allende lacking in writing style. Often the writing didn't seem to flow."
5,Fascinating characters,"What a wonderful book! Complex characters deal with the clash of cultures in Chile and California. I see from reading the comments of others that one person's fascination with rich background and character development is another's frustration with boring details. The comments are interesting to read. However, the comments from Kirkus Reviews bother me. Not only is the review a spoiler, written like an essay by a junior high student who thinks a review is a retelling of the entire plot, but it contains factual errors (Jeremy Sommers was not a sea captain; Joaquin's name is misspelled, for example) and is barely literate. I'm VERY glad that I did not read this review before I finished the very enjoyable Daughter of Fortune."
4,Interesting and historical,"I enjoyed both the story in this book and its historical detail. It is an enjoyable read. The charactors are diverse, the settings rich, and the love story realistic.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ending is uninteresting. It's one of those endings that makes you feel like the author just wanted to be done with it, or was, perhaps, on top of a deadline, so she justs ended it."
3,Isabel Allende's Daughter of Fortune,"I found myself choosing one of many novels from a school list and quite honestly this one just sounded interesting. I began to read and fell into this common, seen before plot. Daughter of fortune is a Mulan and A Doll's House all in one. It seemed seen before and simply, quite boring and repetitive. Oh, and the ending. ...Anywho! if you are stuck reading a quick novel for school and this is on the list, give it a shot, it's really straight forward."
3,Daughter of Fortune,I was on my honeymoon when I read this book and got really involved with the characters. I enjoyed the book and was voraciously reading it when the book just ended! I was incredibly disappointed and just a bit angry! Is there going to be a sequel or series? I don't need a happy ending but I need a much more satisfying conclusion than this book gave me!
3,Daughter of Mediocre Fortune,"Isabel Allende is a charming writer when she sticks to Chilean culture, and writes about what ""she knows."" Cliched as that may sound, when she ventures into writing about Americans, her books break down. She loses confidence, her descriptions dwindle, she doesn't follow up on plot lines; Daughter of Fortune suffers from all of these ills. Allende seems to be writing to pay the bills. The novel is formulaic and dull, and the ending... well, I won't ruin it for you, but to call it an ending is like calling an appetizer dessert."
3,Good History Book,"I like one of the other reviewers that I had to force myself to finish the book. If you are looking for a book that discusses the history of early Americans in California during the gold rush, this is your book. This novel tended to drag a lot. I did however, enjoy the relationship Eliza had would Tao. I do not think that the relationship with Joaquin was developed enough. The ending like another reviewer also mentioned was not good enough. Through the whole book I just felt that I could care less about whatever happened to Joaquin. She should have quit looking for him a hundered pages ago. Eliza's story is interesting , but some of the characters she meets, I could care less about. I do not feel for Eliza and had a hard time relating to her. This book is best for someone who is interesting in historical drama, and doesn't mind reading about random characters."
3,"Good until the last drop,then the last drop left me thirsty","The book is well-written. The characters are well -developed. I enjoyed the history of China, America and Chile. Isabel Allende did a remarkable job of creating a strong feminine character. But when it came time to develop the relationship between the Chinese and Chilean characters she chickened out and abruptly ended the book. The last chapter was wholly unsatisfactory. It left far too many loose ends."
3,"Pleasant, but disappointing","I'd hoped for EVA LUNA or HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS, but this was still a decent read. The ending was unexpected; I thought she would tie up the threads of the story."
2,The characters were life-LESS,"I, too, am very disappointed with this work. I felt no connection whatsoever with the characters of the book. I did not feel or sympathize with their emotions and I couldn't care less if they lived or died. This was really a poor-written book. I respect Allende, but if she keeps writing books like this, she is going to lose me as her reader."
3,Enjoyable until the end,"I am in agreement with many of the other reviewers-this book starts off with a bang and ends with a whimper. I really love Allende and overall Daughter of Fortune is worth reading, but I was disappointed by the ending-the last 50 pages are not the same quality as the rest of the novel."
1,Not Good Literature,"I bought this book in an airport because I'd never read anything by Allende but saw her name enough to assume she was one of the good new writers. I also figured that since Oprah recommended her for her book club that the writing was, well, good. I don't know how much suffered in translation, but the writing was OK at best. Worse, the story reminded me of those second-rate historical novels my mom used to give me as an adolescent. For example, during a sex scene Allende actually describes the heroine's nipples as ""strawberries"" -- I'm not kidding. At the same time the love scenes weren't graphic enough to make it a steamy romance worth reading for the sex. Nothing for no one."
2,Scarcely better than a Danielle Steele novel,"I had high hopes for this book. Other Oprah Picks that I have read have been good. This book -- taking place in both Chile (exotic to me) and California (always interesting) seemed promising. It is sort of a sappy love story, though. A book equivalent of the ""chick flick"" for sure (and I am a woman). I don't like to read books that are so clearly only appropriate for one gender. If you like ""love stories"" with little else to them, this will be a small step up from the usual drivel because Allende does write well. If you prefer books with any substance, however, steer clear of this one."
2,This is the great Allende?,"Never having read any Allende, I was looking forward to this choice of my book group. What a disappointment. This is a poorly written, poorly edited, historical romance, more suited to serialization in a supermarket ladies' magazine."
3,"90% fabulous, 10% god-awful","I really enjoyed the majority of this book, but it completely fell apart at the end.""Daughter of Fortune"" is the story of Eliza Sommers, an orphaned girl who is taken in by a well-off family in Chile during the late 1800's. Eliza grows into a spirited young woman and experiences true love, which she keeps hidden from her family. When her lover leaves for California in search of a gold fortune, Eliza discovers that she is pregnant and sets off on a harrowing sea voyage, determined to be reunited with the man she loves. Along the way, Eliza is helped by a young Chinese man, doctor Tao Chi'en, and together they make their way to San Francisco in search of their dreams.This is a well-written story with dynamic characters, and I couldn't put it down. However, the ending totally sucks! It was stupid, and in my opinion wasn't even a real ending, so I feel completely gypped and therefore will only give this novel three stars. Hmph!"
5,The western dime novel becomes international literature,"Joaquin Murietait seems is the inspiration for a novel about a young girl, young love and 19th century culture in England andin Chile.The novelist is a master of plot and characterization who blends understanding of three major cultures: Chinese, English and Spanish-Latin American.I have read novels by major Americans written in English ( not translated from Spanish) that weren't as well documented or as factual as this one.There is no doubt that Isabel Allende is probably one of the major popular novelists of our time.It is a western...This novel deserves a read!"
4,A classic in the works,"I read this book on the recommendation of one of my friends, and I absolutely am loving it!! The way the author, Isabel Allende, uses wording makes the book come to live in more ways then one. You can actually imagine that you are a character in the book, feeling the hardships that they are dealt during this period in time. (The California gold rush) It's one of those books you can learn from, plus enjoy an enticing story about hardships and love. An excellent read!"
4,I wanted it to keep going,"I agree with another reviewer, it had such an abrupt ending and I was disappointed by this. I really did want it to keep going! It kept my attention and I felt the historical references were interesting, though I am not by any means a historical buff so I do not know what of it is true."
5,"Clean, Passionate and Adventurous!","I loved this book, ""Isabel Allende Daughter of Fortune!"" It is a clearly written, well developed story about an orphaned Chilean woman who follows her lover to California during the Gold Rush of 1849. It becomes apparent that the search for her lover becomes an impossible mission, but instead she finds the fabric of which she's made and discovers a new life of promise. I found myself living ""the adventure"" in Eliza's shoes, smelling the musty stench of fish nets on the cargo boat and visualize the wrinkley face lines of Dr. Tao Chi'en who becomes an unlikely friend and confidant to Eliza. I loved this book! I plan to re-read this book once I finish my new series, Amy Tan."
5,My Personal Review,"Daughter of Fortune is one of the best historical fiction novels I have read. The book was relatively easy to understand yet was so well written it really touched me. For example, the scene about what life was like back then for women. I thought it was as if I was there, watching the story unfold, experiencing it. I would recommend this book to everyone because it's a story you can learn from. Allende bases the story on a historical time period that will always be there to remind us what it was like to live as a woman then and how much they had to risk."
2,Terrible Ending,First time I have read this author - very disappointing ending. The book just stopped. Way too many loose ends and no sense of closure.
2,Not up to her usual excellence,"Disappointing. Missing is the magic of her other books, both in the plot and in the style."
3,Leaves you wanting more,"I enjoy reading Allande's work. She seems to draw me into each of her characters leading me to wonder how much of herself is in each one, they are so believeable. Daughter Of Frotune leaves me wanting to know more about what happened with the rest of her life..."
3,A letdown,"I have read all of Isabel Allende's book. With each book I felt that she was not as good as her first The House of the Spirits. The latest Daughter of Fortune is certainly a dissapointment. It is more a detective story than a master work. I read it to the end because I wanted to know what happened to the characters. One can say it means that she captivated the reader, so did Aghata Christi. I feel that Allende has spent her literary art, and therefore she should stop."
1,Predictable: like a Danielle Steele Novel (no offense DS),"What has happened to the intriguing and well written Oprah selections? Most dissapointing. A preditcable tale about a young woman with troubles in love. The writing was very simple (perhaps because of the translation). I have so little free time that I want a book that engages me and compels me to put off all other things and read -read-read. This is not that book. Oprah, you did so well selecting good writers of great novels earlier in your book club. Go back to good writers, please. If you want a book that will knock your socks off: good writing and great story, I suggest The Pact by Jodi Picoult. If you have precious little time for reading, I would suggest a different selection."
2,Listening vs. Reading,"I got the tape version of this book. I started with excitement to ""hear"" some great storyline with geographical and histoical info. Contrary to other opinions, I don't agree with the ""sudden ending"" that others complained about. I heard 3 tapes (out of 10) and decided to skip to the last one to wrap up the story.....I thought that a ""sudden ending"" would have happened after one tape.....the only line that didn't get solved for me (probably happened in the 9th tape) is what was her parentage? If I can find someone else who read the book, maybe I'll find the answer to the most interesting storyline in the book."
1,Save your money....,"If you have ever read a book by Allende before, please don't read this one. It will cause you to lose all respect for her as a writer. I'll wait to check out the next one from the library before I buy her books blindly again. I was reading Ahab's Wife (Naslund) at the same time and though the stories are similar, the quality of the writing and story are so much better in Ahab's Wife."
3,DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE,A good read and well worth the time. A love story and more. Characters are developed slowly and carefully.Part II moved a bit slowly but in all-it was worth the time.
