1,Sorry - but a little TOO MUSHY!,"I bought this for my 11-year-old niece. We share a love of books. I understand the previous reviews - the book does say a lot of encouraging words....but to me and my niece, it goes a little overboard. TOO MUSHY for us! Too oooeeey gooooeeey. Don't get me wrong, she and I are very loving to one another, kisses each time we see each other, we even have our own song...but this book was just a little too over the top and 'dorky' for us."
4,Good reading,Good reading. Fun reading. Entertaining reading. My daughter enjoys it and enjoys it with her friends too over sleepovers. I give it two thumbs up!
4,Good debut,"Solid debut from Nothington. Features Jay Northington from Tsunami Bomb but sounds nothing like that band. Just better! Their most recent record Roads, Bridges and Ruins is excellent, but this one is good too! By the way, I only review albums that I like or really, really hate (like Hinder's newest!). So don't think I love everything I just want to push those records I think are good."
3,A nice sample but,"I feel this album is lacking 2 importent cuts ""South Of RoundrockTexas"" (Dale's tribute to Austin including a video featuring musical buddies) and ""A Real Country Song"" which some fans considered their anthem in 1996.If i were just starting to buy his material from this period i would get the 3 full albums."
5,Works great at a good price,"I've used these units at work for two activities. One is the intended application of soldering. It works fine for that. The second is to remove the smell of epoxy, when potting parts for cross-sectioning. The epoxy really smells up the lab and this little guy takes care of it, as long as the mixed epoxy is placed near the air inlet/filter.This is a simple device. Just a fan and a carbon filter. Not overly quiet, but not overly loud either. It comes with 3 filters and each seems to last a while. Extra filters are pretty cheap. Nothing like a product that doesn't cost a bundle and does what it's supposed to."
3,Kind of works,"Don't expect this to clear out a great deal of fumes. Gets the soldering smoke out of the way, but I am not sure how well it actually absorbs anything."
3,A necessity for anyone who solders,"The Weller smoke absorber serves a very important purpose by protecting you from inhaling toxic fumes from solder and flux. I have used this same model at work and bought one for my home workshop. I like the compact size and quality construction. The price is very attractive as similar models code significantly more.I only have two concerns. I was a little disappointed with the volume of airflow, the absorber has to be very close to the source of the fumes. My other concern is the noise, the Weller WSA350 is louder than I expected.Overall the Weller WSA350 is a quality product whos benefits certainly outweigh the minor negatives.Weller is a well know brand who produces high quality and reliable products"
3,Good prince but not too effective,"For the price it works OK. The suction is not enough unless you are VERY close to the solder station. I'd say if you solder EVERY day or very fequently, do no get this unit get a more expensive one that will truly protect your lungs from any toxic fumes. BTW - the guy that said this is quiet is just plain lying. There is NOTHING quiet about this unit. In fact if you use it frequently I'd say to get earplugs to prevent permant hearing loss. (seriously). The DB of noice HAS got to be very high. I am glad I only use this monthly or less."
1,Encountering the Book of Genesis (Encountering Biblical Studies) [Kindle Edition],"I love this series, but I am extremely disappointed with the Kindle version. I boughtEncountering the Book of Genesis (Encountering Biblical Studies)but can't use it on my Kindle Touch because it isn't compatible. Boo! I can still read it on my computer but I prefer having it on my Kindle. So I say again, ""Boo!"""
1,Not worth your time,"Misspelled words, hyphens in random places, lack of punctuation. Besides that, the story was pretty bad. I found myself disliking all of the characters. Also, entirely too much domestic violence. Pass on this one."
5,Everyone Cheats,"I didn't really know what I was getting what I got this book. I picked it up for free and boy was I pleased with it! This is a multilayered tale being told from many different angles. You get to hear about the whys of things not just from the cheating spouses but from the people they are having affairs with and the people they are wronging.Although the title is ""Unfaithful Wives"" the women aren't the only culprits. In fact the story starts with a cheating husband. Never mind that his wife is sleeping around, he doesn't know that. Which then turns into a series of events that quickly spirals out of control for everyone involved.If you're looking for something quick and pulpy that reads like a Cohen bros movie plays, then this is a solid bet."
1,DNF,"I'm glad I got this free so I didn't feel bad about hating it immediately. Completely unreadable tripe. Badly written, badly executed. I don't know what it was supposed to be but it was lousy."
1,Really?,I could only get thru the first few paragraphs. I felt as if I was reading a different era and it seemed broken and jumping around pointlessly?
1,CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE,"I utilized Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" option. The first time I made the rice, it didn't taste the same as the store bought rice. Since I have a fairly large family, I assumed that doubling the recipe contributed to the negative outcome. Unfortunately, I tried the rice again and wasn't pleased. A few weeks later, my son discovered that the rice expired within 1-2 months of our purchase. Since we've never had problems with ""Rice A Roni"" before, I'm contributing the problem to the expiration date."
4,"""He Wasn't Happy Unless His Nuts Were In a Vise""","Mr. Pryor used filmmaking as therapy, I think, to take a look at his own often-troubled life. While it's difficult to put a lot of this together without knowing the background on Richard Pryor, it's still a fascinating, heartbreaking, and funny film. My only real complaint is that it's too short; I'd love to see the outtakes on a future (hope, hope) DVD release. Sadly, this was Mr. Pryor's only directorial effort (aside from a concert film)."
5,"This is classic Richard Pryor! I think it's funny, and the bomb!","I chose this & have been trying to find it for over five years. It was either sold out or the store owners just didn't have it. I'm elated, happy & look forward to ordering more! Thank you & HAPPY NEW YEAR! I chose this because it's a true story, & would"
4,funny,wanted it in my movie library the disc was loose in the case I hope there are no problems do to that
5,Worth every penny,This is a classic tells you alot about Richard that you did not no if you do not own this movie get it add this to your collection worth every penny
5,TWO THUMBS UP!!!,"This move is absolutely horrible...I don't know why he even took tha time out his life to make this piece of junk...WHAT!I'm playing with yall...I really, really, REALLY enjoyed this movie. I love movies that go beyond tha stars...telling what happens when tha cameras are not rolling in a star's life...I like tha other beyond tha stars movies like, The Temptations, The Ernest Green Story....but this one is my favorite cuz Richard is my favorite comedian...actually, he's tha GREATEST OF ALL TIME!If you haven't seen it...watch it...if you have seen it...watch it again...cuz it's that good...and I give it TWO THUMBS WAY UP!"
5,Same as Lowes but less money,This purchase went with what we found at Lowes and they didn't have enough. Next time I will look in Amazon before going to Lowes.
2,Pretentious and dull,"After reading John Leake's book on Unterweger, I was eager to see Malkovich's treatment. Mistake. If one doesn't know anything about Unterweger, I think it would only be worse. No context or background is really given, and there is a lot of overwrought emoting and rather silly behaviour by the actor. The orchestra and singers are all competent, but the musical choices weren't enlightening, nor did they add anything to the story or M's performance. Very disappointed. I recommend you skip this one."
2,Not so great,"I had to read this book for a school book report. After reading the first page and reviews on Amazon I was expecting it to be a bit more exciting, but I found myself mentally complaining every time I picked it up and forced myself to read it. I will admit it had it's good points, but all in all I didn't enjoy it much. Maybe adults would like it more, but honestly, I don't think many kids my age would."
4,Great lift kit,Works well but some of the bolts were to long. Had to shim with washers. The bumper brackets are not very substantial and required additional holes. Besides that works fine.
1,Very disappointed,Made of metal and plastic. Like a toy. Arrived broken in many places - both metal and plastic parts. Major effort to fix or return. Would not recommend to anyone.
1,"It's not exactly flimsy but you do get what you pay for,","I thought I was taking a risk and sure enough, it split in two places when I tried to screw it securely. It came with no assembly instructions, and no picture. So I came back to this description and the base I got was different. One solid piece not two is in the picture. I think the screws were to long and they cracked it in two places. I came with two different kinds of screws, but both were long. I got 4 black, and the rest were silver which show. Also got 4 extra, Would have rather had the right kind instead. I hot glued it and am going to let it go rather than now try to buy a better one and triple my costs for a whim purchase."
4,"An excellent work, highly recommended!","I really like this CD! It's very relaxing and thought-provoking. This is how synthesizer music should sound, and the guitar blends perfectly(mostly).I was surprised to learn that the classical music was all done with synth. It sounds so real! My only complaint is that the delicate beauty of the Mountains of Heaven is spoiled by the discordant distorted crash of the last track. This is unnerving and prevents me from listening at bedtime.If not for that, I would give it 5 stars.It is still an excellent work, highly recommended, though they should have ended it with track 11."
5,"This is ""soul music"" with a rich variety of moods and themes","I really enjoy this album, and think the artists are off to a leaping start. I especially like the wide spectrum of moods the music evokes. Each composition takes you someplace, some familiar and comforting, some exotic and exciting. Smooth, rich performances with ""soul."" I play ARCANA often, at home, work, even in the car, and look forward to the next CD. Good work!"
3,Not bad for new age,"This is new age with a little more edge(not much more) I'm not a fan of new age but this is the best of it I've heard so far. I can actually tolerate this Cd, which is a good thing cause my girlfriend loves it. A few of the tracks (Regeneration and All She Wrote) I like, and the rest is interesting at times..The guitar is not bad but should be louder and there should be more of it."
4,GMC Sonoma Body Lift,I had a mechanic help with this install and it went really smooth. This was the exact fit for my 2002 GMC Sonoma ZR2 4x4. The only thing I disliked was the tire clearance. I have the ZR2 Sonoma that came from the factory installed with 31x10.50x15 tires. I bought 265x75x16 tires and wheels from jegs to install after the lift kit was installed and the tires rubbed the fender flares pretty bad and got cuts. These tires are not much bigger at all than what was already on my truck but I had to cut out parts of the fender flares to make these tires work. If I would have known this I may have gone with a bigger suspension lift instead of the body lift which is cheaper. Other than that this lift really improved the look of my truck.
4,Overall Good Product,"Item was received in a timely manner and the finished installed kit provided satisfactory appearance for 2001 S10 Crew Cab. However, the kit as received was missing the fuel line vent hose extension which was noticed only when installing the kit. As I didn't have the time to contact the supplier or wait on delivery, had to fabricate my own from a piece of light wall electrical conduit.Need to exercise some caution when installing as several of the bolts are the same length; however, they are slightly different sizes and it easy to confuse the bolts used to fasten the body to the chasis and the bolts for the radiator fan shroud.With installed body lift, was able to install a set of 31x10.5 tires. To achieve a more balanced look and provide greater clearance for the larger tires, the front end was raised by tightening down on the torsion bars which leveled up the front and back ends."
3,Weak on-off switch,"My wife and I have owned this electric toothbrush for about 3 years. We're satisfied in every way but one -- the button which turns it on (and off)seems to fail after several years' use. First the button itself -- a thin, flexible membrane which covers the switch -- disintegrates. When that happens you can still turn it on and off by poking a finger into the resulting hole to make contact with the switch. However, eventually even that fails, as the switch itself falls apart. This means you can't turn it on or off. This happened to both of our toothbrushes, mine failing several months before my wife's. Phillips needs to re-engineer the switch to make it sturdier. I's a fairly expensive toothbrush to have to replace every few years (IMHO)."
3,My2cents,"I had high hopes and they were largely achieved...but the cleat could be longer as it pulls out of the wood easily and the handle could be twice as long, easily -- to give more leverage and the no-slip grabber-stopper is not that great. It does what it does but it could be improved."
1,These clearly are NOT gas shocks,"I ordered these shock absorbers in March but did not have a chance to install them until this past weekend. Upon taking them from the box, it was pretty clear they were not gas shocks, as they were not tied closed, as is usual with gas shocks, and after putting them on my Jeep, they bottom out over the smallest of speed bumps. The OEM shocks, which were gas charged, never bottomed out on the same speed bumps.Unfortunately, Amazon's return policy states I could only return them up to April 6, so I'm out the money I spent on these incorrectly labeled (not gas) shocks, which clearly are not a quality product, else I would not bottom out over the small speed bumps as they did."
4,Spooky movie - great for Halloween or any other time you want a chill or two!,"Frightening situation in a frightening place for an all-around spooky movie - great for Halloween! Ewan McGregor, here in one of his earlier films, seems honestly tripped out by his new job in a morgue, guarding dead bodies."
3,So-So,This movie was O.K. Not really suspenseful and it was easy to predict who the killer was. I do not remember this being in the theaters...
5,Don't read this late at night!,"This book is so engrossing, I can't say enough how much I enjoyed reading it. The author skillfully weaves mythology, psychology, theology, and even a shocking dose of pathology into her characters and their adventures; no emotion is spared. I had no idea that reading about knights in shining armor could be this much fun. Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I cried, but I definitely was dragging the next morning because reading yet another (and another) chapter always took precedence over sleep! During the last fourth of the book I was so mesmerized that my husband felt ignored and neglected since I completely refused to talk to him until I'd gotten to the ending. I highly recommend reading Sir Gawain's Challenge, and I can't wait to read the next book."
1,"A big disappointment, most recipes useless","For those of you who know about Candida, I am currently on the 'strict diet' which is the part where you actually kill off the candida overgrowth (and the part that takes the longest) and as we know, the part where you cannot have any sugars, even natural ones such as those found in sweet vegetables and fruit.I bought this book to inspire me during this dull phase, and to help me to make my meals more interesting.I was very disappointed to see that the person who wrote this clearly has no idea about candida. A lot of the recipes contain tomatoes, carrots, squash, red bell pepper, and even potato. All of these are forbidden while actually trying to cure the candida.This book does contain some nice, healthy recipes, but the majority are only useful if you have already cured your candida. the title should just be 'a yeast-free cookbook' and should have no claim to understanding candida albicans.Don't waste your money!"
2,Not So Accurate,"This book really didn't help me much. The foods that are on the ""allow"" list are in actuality NOT allowed and can really set a candida patient back on their quest for health. I would not recommend to someone that is truly fighting this disease."
2,Ok but there has to be better,I thought this book would be good to get some recipes and yes there was some good information ie eat lots of raw vegetables etc. what to avoid but then a lot of the recipes just weren't realistic - WHO is going to go out and buy tongue or kidneys or liver and cook them for dinner/breakfast and just some of the recipes you just wouldn't make or buy the ingredients from your local supermarket....I wouldn't recommend this book sorry!!
3,Disappointing,"This book is incorrectly titled. Recipes and food lists include foods that shouldn't be on a candida-elimination diet (like dairy, alfalfa sprouts). Recipes and suggestions make a lot of sense for overall healthy eating, however. I'll probably use some of them, but I wish I'd just gotten the book from the library rather than spent $ on it."
5,Shout out for this book!,"It's time to go candida-free again! I was SO VERY thankful to see acknowledgements from the author to William Crook, MD, and to see Dr. Crook write the intro!! That man changed my life in the late 90's, and it looks like his work has not been forgotten! Thank you, Pat!! I look forward to finishing your book, and seeing if I can find the hidden pearls of wisdom from Dr. Crook!!!"
3,Candidiasis ad infinitum,"Of the large numbers of books on this subject, this one offered little new information. I did see a few recipes that appealed, but could have easily skipped this one."
4,Candida Albicans,"This cookbook has given me some great ideas for following the anti-candida diet. I have enjoyed several of the recipes. Absolutely no fruit is allowed according to this book. Some of the recipes, I discard since I don't eat red meat or raw eggs. I was a little disappointed that many of the salad recipes involve the homeade mayonnaise, which contains raw eggs. However, I have substituted that with hummus."
2,Not inspirational enough,"I found this book very dull. Even the lay out is uninspiring. Furthermore, if you have just a little bit of experience with food and flavours there is not much to learn here."
5,"Candidia Albican Yeast-Free Cookbook, The: How Good Nutrition Can Help Fight the Epidemic of Yeast-Related Diseases",This book has helped answer many of my questions regarding Candida and has explained what I can expect as I go through the healing process. It is very informative in relation to diet and has good recipes to make the plain food we have to eat a little more exciting.
2,Not a yeast free cookbook,Many of the recipes it provides are not helpful because I have compared it to another book that provides a list of foods not to eat and this cookbook has those foods as some ingredients.
1,waste of time,"This book is not user friendly. The rainbow diet is not an easy lifestyle. I don't know many people that would stay on it. I bought another candida book along with this one, and the ""Candida Bible"" is far superior. This book is boring, not easy to follow and unappealing in every way. I haven't tried any of the recipes as I am satisfied with the other book and websites I've found with a lot better info."
3,candida albican yeast-free cookbook,Book was informative but recipes were a little lacking in imagination. I used it more for ideas than actual meal plans. Recipes just needed something to make them a little more appealing.
4,A Completely Educational Novel,"Lightning From The West promotes the idea of learning History through fiction. This novel contains the basics of the Civil War, but at the sametime puts forward a feasible fictional plot. The first day of the Battle of Gettysburg is brought alive through the writing. You can feel the agony of the soldiers in battle. The characters blend with the storyline and the plot. The novel is filled with action and drama fitting for a Civil War story. Lieutenant Harrison Elington, the fictional character of the very real 26th North Carolina Infantry, portrays conflict and sincerity with human qualities that were present during the war. A good read!"
4,music,Not exactly what I expected... but was good and I liked it. I am looking for more good tunes. Like that old time western.
5,"A fine, comprehensive textbook on real-time systems","This is a fine, comprehensive textbook for real-time systems. It covers many aspects of real-time systems in an even, consistent way. For basic, foundational knowledge, Laplante's book in its third edition is probably the finest that I have encountered.The book is foundational and gives a good overview of concepts important to real-time systems. Don't expect to find the latest ""fads"" in programming or interesting ""tricks of the trade"" in the book; that is not the purpose of his book. I use the book to confirm and review basic concepts when developing real-time concepts.I have 24 years experience in developing various real-time systems: medical devices, military equipment, and spacecraft instruments. I also lecture and write about real-time systems; Laplante's book is a necessary part of my library of real-time books."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!,"DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT! Model #61360 does NOT heat the water, it only has a very small heating element to keep hot water that you add to it from rapidly cooling down.ALL reviews that claim this unit heats the water are either lies from Amazon or the manufacturer. It is possible I guess that this model has been changed but I doubt it since a review posted just a few months before my purchase claimed the water got hot. This is an absolute lie and Amazon refuses to take any responsibility for the intentionally false claims, but I'm not completely convinced that Amazon is not behind some of the bogus reviews of this and other products I've purchased."
1,restock fee,the product was useless not deep to contain size 10 feet without splashing water all overt he floor. never the less I got charged restocking fee. I will not shop from them again. Ezio
5,Execllent Product,"This was a Christmas gift for my wife who had hinted strongly that a foot bath/massager would please her -- and she is very pleased! The best aspects are that it maintains heat very well, the bubbling massage is strong and soothing, and it will allow her to use bath salts and other soothing products. The controls are easy to use and the cord is long enough to allow for easy placement. True, it is heavy when filled but you have to expect that with a quality product. I looked at cheaper models but the quality and the ability of this model to use bath salts drove the decision. The pedi attachments work well and are easily stored in the bath. It is easy to drain and clean after use which is important. My wife is thrilled and thus so am I. Highly recommended!"
3,Hot Water,I had to subtract some stars because the water gets so hot it could warrant a blister! If there are any kids in the house don't let them use it if its been on for over 10mins. Although my feet do feel amazing after I use it. The girlfriend really likes it. The trick is to let your feet soak with the salts until its to hot to stand then turn it off and enjoy the rollers and mini peducure thing. I would not buy this item again only because the water gets to a temprature that can only be explained as dipping your feet in hot lava.
4,"Very good foot spa for the moneyI've been using this spa for a few weeks now, almost daily","I've been using this foot spa for a few weeks now, almost daily. The jets are pretty powerful and the attachments work great. I'm very happy with this spa."
1,Be very careful who you order this from,"I ordered this as a present from ""DiscountsJungle"" and did not receive the item advertised on this page. It looks nothing like what's in the picture and according to the instruction booklet, nor does it heat cold water. When I questioned them about it, I was told 'it was the only one they have in stock'. I can return it, but I have to insure it at my expense. I hope Amazon.com is paying attention to this, because I can't imagine it helps their credibility. How do I know which merchant to order the correct item from?Update: After receiving my return, I noticed they changed the picture on the website, but their description of the product is still inaccurate.Final Update: I'll give them credit; they finally updated the description. Keep in mind though that the other reviews on this product were made for a different product. The one now featured does not heat cold water."
2,Hot Spa Foot Bath,"The title of the product is pretty good, Hot Spa. However it should be HOTTER than you can handle spa! I was really booking forward to getting this product. It is really expensive, but I thought I will try it because I really need something for me feet. I stand at work all day. It does heat the water. The problem is there is no thermostat so the water continues to heat! After 5 minutes I could no longer keep my feet in the water they were burning! It's not much of a treat if you have to keep pouring out water and putting in cold and still can only use it for 5 minutes. It say's not to use for longer than 20... right. First you have to be able to keep your feet in. Also the water jets work great until you put your feet in. Then it's just a few bubbles and the top water gets submerged so you really don't feel anything. When you put the rollers in the bottom it lifts your feet up so only the bottom of your foot in in the water (but it still burns like crazy! DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY."
3,Great relief but messy,After day of standing on my feet I look forward to relaxing in my foot bath but not so much cleaning up water. It splashes and can be hallenging moving it from the sink without getting water on you and the floor.
1,Beware - product received is NOT the same as product described.,"Though the product you receive is the same model number as the one in the Amazon description it is NOT the same product. Amazon description says with rotating pedicenter (our major reason for purchasing) as of the date of this review. Product you receive has stationary pedicenter. Should have read the reviews first, I now see others have had the same experience.We returned this product 3 hours after receiving. There was no issue with returning, so great to have purchased it from Amazon!"
2,Not strong enough,I was disappointed to find that this foot bath was not deep enough and did not have the strength to really relax my feet.
1,terrible product,What a disappointment! It splashed water (with the level at indicated point); it sounded like a vacuum cleaner and could be heard 2 doors down through closed doors. It does NOT heat water but claims to keep warm water warm. I didn't get the chance to find out as I was dodging the shower of water and turned it off quickly. Just to be clear - we did try to work with it...changing water levels and settings etc. - no improvement.have sent it back. paying shipping of course. haven't gotten confirmation of refund.
3,Vibration factor,"While it is true that the water gets hot and stays hot, and the spa bubbles feel very nice, there is a problem. It is so noisy that conversation must cease, and don't even think about listening to music or a movie while the the are jets on (unless you use headphones). Also, even sitting across the room from it, a companion will feel the vibration through the floor and furniture. I find it an irritating appliance to be around. Also, it is a bit awkward to clean out, and the only way to really do a good job of it is to use a long bristled brush to reach in between the ribs of the sole plates. None the less, this spa is a favorite indulgence for my teenager."
3,If you like it HOT,"This product does, as advertised, get hot. Very hot. Unfortunately there seems to be no thermostat, and no seperate controls for the various functions. Just a single on-off. I find it a little too hot for my tastes, and since the other functions (water circulation, etc) only operate together with the heat, I could only leave it on for a few minutes at a time. I ended up returning it."
2,not warm long enough,"I found that the unit doesn't keep the water warm much longer than a bucket. I filled the tub with hot water, but I didn't get the 'oooh ahhh' foot bath feeling for very long before it was over and I was headed back to the sink for more hot water.I was able to return for a partial refund and I'm trying the Brookstone unit now."
2,Not the spa it once was,"This is the NEW ""improved"" version of this tub. I have had several of the old tub and loved them. It now has a one-touch button, and all functions must be on or off. No more choosing what you want. Heater has no control, and gets too hot to stand. I'm not sure why the manufacturer had to mess with with a great tub. I will not but another one. Time to find a new tub manufacturer."
4,HotSpa Professional ultimate Foot Bath,"I am really pleased with the foot spa. My husband uses it also and we find great relief to our tired and aching feet and hands. I have carpal tunnel and use it for that and it works great. A little messing, but worth it!"
1,Not worth the money!,"My Husband bought me this for christmas and bought it based on the reviews. I used it once and I am very dissapointed with this footbath. Does not keep the water warm like it says, you fill the footbath with water to the fill line and the water barely covers your feet! When you turn it on, the water splashes all over the place! on the floor behind the footbath and up your legs! The rollers inside the footbath don't do anything! I would not recommend this to anyone!"
1,Very dissatisfied,It is VERY noisy and water splashes everywhere with even a little movement. The vibrating effect is useless. I wish I could return mine.
1,WHAT A P.O.S. !!!,"WOW, bought this for my wife B-day present,, & what a p.o.s. it is,, should of know that the good reviews must be from the factory workers,, 1)only the foot bubblers only came out of the left side,, 2nd) the heater didn't even keep the More then warm water we started with it went cold in 5 min's,,since it was a B-day present I had it more then 30-days before she used it,, & now I can't return it,, for replacement,, Tks Hellon Of POS,, Pissed off James Broughton of Henderson, Nv."
3,"Its ok, but its not worth the price",I bought this hotspa for mothers day. The massage is great and the different massage tools and cleaning tools. I only found two faults one the price the other is that the water gets cold quickly. Overall I don't think is worth the price and I would it expected to be better than the cheaper ones in terms on heating the water.
3,Too bulky to keep,"I had high hopes for this foot spa. But it was so bulky and gaudy,I had to return it. It wasn't worth it. Couldn't figure out where to keep it when it wasn't being used. And the gold trim was hard to take..."
2,Disappointing,"I returned this product - it heats up - that's one good thing but the whirlpool feature is VERY loud and doesn't seem to do much either.Perhaps if I watched TV while using it, but I don't watch TV at all."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,This spa is the best so far... I had tried two different brands and wasn't satisfied with either so I returned them... This spa truly has a heat feature that no other spa I have used has been able to compare to... You won't be disappointed... Pedi day at home is great...
5,Review of Helen of Troy Hotspa,"Bought this item for my wife to help with foot problems. She normally does not like gadgets but loved this product. It has helped with the foot problems and I have used it and it felt great. It heats the water and when the water gets too hot, it is very easy to tap the on/off switch with your foot and continue enjoying this foot bath. Strongly recommend it even if you dont have foot problems."
2,freight train,"After reviewing many different foot baths from AMAZON, i chose this Helen of Troy model. Amazon sent it very quickly but I wish i had heeded the reviewers that said it was LOUD! that word does NOT even come close to the sound it makes. I am sending it back after only the first use. My little dog hid and trembled from the sound. Even with the TV LOUD, I couldn't hear it.PROS: it heated the water wonderfullyCONS: the rollers were aggravati ng and useless. The water barely covers the toes and I have small feet. The attachments are USELESS!Choose for yourself if this model is what you need."
3,HotSpa Professional Foot Bath,"This product excels in every respect, except if you have a foot bigger than a men's 10, it does not have enough room to be comfortable for larger size feet."
5,Works as advertised,"Got the Spa, tried it, water warms quickly and gets hot enough after a short time that you know it's hot, bubbles as described in ad. Overall like the product and recommend it highly."
4,Hot Bubbly Foot Spa,"This foot spa really bubbles and heats up hot, there is only one control for heat and jets. I have to take my feet out after a while. It should have a temperature control since anyone with diabetic neuropathy may not feel the heat and possibly harm themselves if they leave their feet in to long."
1,lasted only 5 months,"We used this product several times a week for 5 months when the motor got a ""burning odor"" and stopped working. The warranty for no-charge replacement is 30 days; after that you have to pack and mail at your cost and send $10 for return postage. I'm not so sure it's worth that. This was more expensive than most of the foot spas I looked at but it was rated one of the best, so I went for it. When it was working it was very nice - but only 5 months???"
3,Does the job,I would have liked to see multiple speeds - this is just on or off. Quality build however. Very noisy (vibration into floor) when you have it on the floor running.
5,"""Move Over Dirk Pitt""","I have read all of the Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler books, and I enjoyed ""Dropback"" as much as any of them. The protoganist Dan Larson is a likable superagent-fisherman who always gets the most beautiful girls and the baddest bad guys. The book is set in high-energy tropical resort settings from Palm Beach to the Mexican Riviera. This book has it all! Sex: Dan Larson wouldn't be a self-respecting superhero if he didn't have at least a few love interests. Drugs: Hundreds of kilo's, all you want. Action: There is enough special forces action and high-tech mahem to satisfy diehards. Fast Boats, Huge Fish, Beautiful Women.... I highly recommend the book."
5,Highly recommended,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a masterful blend of classic intrigue interwoven with the glamorous high end sportishing world. Superb character development, keenly accurate details and location descriptions enhance the thrills of following the undercover agent through South Florida and Mexico. A real page turner!I look forward to the continuing adventures of Dan Larsen!"
5,ACTION PACKED,Congratulations Piety! Great book!!! You really captured the Sport Fishing scene. Full of suspense and intrigue plus a great story. Looking forward to your next novel. Good Fishing!!! CARIBBEAN
3,I Can Speak Italian,"Slightly confusing to use at first, but quickly provides phrases & words for immediate use. Has voice so you can hear how the words are pronounced, which is very helpful. Voice can be slowed down for clearer pronunciation."
2,Uncoordinated Mishmash,"This textbook is a mess! Certain sections such as those that deal with classical transmission genetics are reasonably good. On the other hand, those sections that deal with recombinant DNA/genomic technology and the molecular basis of cancer are very weak. The writing in these sections is convoluted, and the level of coverage fluctuates wildly between oversimplification and mind-numbing detail. The book does not seem to have a clear target audience in mind, and the authors appear to have not spoken with each other during the writing. Considering the relative strengths of their earlier text, ""Introduction to Genetic Analysis,"" this new effort is all the more disappointing."
3,Better than sitting through a lecture...I guess.,"This beginning look at genetics is nothing special. A good foundation for genetic anaylsis and problem solving can be obtained by sifting through this book. However, there are many confusing, if not down-right ridiculous, statements made. Understanding genetics is not difficult and this book attempts to make it such."
2,Failed Attempt,This book did not offer a clear and easily understood overview of genetic analysis. Either did my professor. The confusing setup and text is this book was its downfall. I do not recomend this book to the beginer.
1,"Low price, Low quality","Conked out after just 3 months of purchase! Stay away from this one, and buy another one if you can...Basically I'm trying to warn others because I had a bad experience with this one."
1,broken stereo,i would love to know why a machine that looks so great could work so bad i bought my husband this stereo a year ago it came in and we put cds in it just like it said to then it cramed 3 cds in the first slot messing up some of my husbands cds you claimed it must have broken in the mail then you sent me a new one and a few days ago it did the same thing only 11 mo later now i am looking for a great stereo with only 6 weeks left till christmas thank you
1,Looks good but mine doesn't work,My biyfriend bought me this stereo for my birthday and the first one he bought the CD player would not work so we took it back and know the second is having the same problem. Someone help.I am very unsatisfied with this purchase. It looks like a good quality but it doesn't work like it should.
3,Interesting thematic reiterations,"The ex-prog rock titan doesn't skimp on providing interesting compositions from off the beaten path, but with Cuckooland the eccentric French saloon influence seems to burn itself out, contributing to an apathetic weariness over time."
5,The Joy of Robert Wyatt Continues,"A new Wyatt album is always a moment of joy in my household. The voice, the sounds, the adventure continues with ""Cuckooland"". Those who know of the pleasures that Wyatt can bring will be delighted. After the first couple of listens, you will be hooked. Wyatt always has us thinking. Playing with chords, wrapping his hands around some haunting and beautiful melodies, there is much to be enjoyed here. The visit by Eno on ""Forest"" is a standout. It is vintage Wyatt and Eno. Guitar returns to the Wyatt sound in the persons of David Gilmour (""Forest"") and the wonderful Paul Weller on the playful ""Lullaloop"". There is even a single lurking here in the great rendition of the Carlos Jobim tune, ""Insensatez"". Beautiful! More playful, varied and consistently stronger than the great ""Shleep"", ""Cuckooland"" is Wyatt at his best, making thoughtful, relevant and beautiful music."
4,Nice Collection,"It is a nice collection of shows, although some my boys really aren't into. I wish I would have known what shows were on the DVD before I purchased (too lazy to do much investigation), so for those like me, here you go:Dora the Exporer: ""Boots's Special Day""The Backyardigans: ""Knights Are Brave And Strong""Wonder Pets!: ""Save the Duckling"" and ""Save the Kitten""Blue's Clues: ""Meet Polka Dots!""Little Bill: ""The Zoo"" and ""My Pet Elephant""Max & Ruby: ""Ruby Writes a Story"", ""Max's Dominoes"", and ""Grandma's Attic"""
4,Great DVD,"My Little daugther love this DVD, because have a great compilation of catoons and actually is better because has more running time that a normal DVD."
3,Sphygmomanometer,"I misread the description and did not realize that this BP cuff is an obesity cuff, and therefore the resulting blood pressure found will be lower than the actual blood pressure (seeing as the cuff will not accurately stop the arterial blood flow before it begins flowing again). I now have the same cuff in the regular adult size and it works great with a Prestige Medical stethoscope."
4,Hugo Black Biography,"Response time was very short. You couldl tell that the book was used, but nothing beyond what would be considered ""normal"" wear. Overall conditioin was very good."
2,Intriguing... but the errors are distracting,"I really wanted to like this book, but in the end, my enjoyment of it was hindered by the constant grammar errors. This book really needed an editor. There were so many errors it just distracted me to no end.The book is written in the form of a diary, and it is an interesting piece of fiction. I like the idea that someone would choose to emigrate to North Korea because of their political ideology. Most of the actual American defectors went to North Korea because they were running away from something, and this book actually postulated what would happen if someone were to run to the ""Communist wonderland"" as the North puts forth in their propaganda. We then watch as the ideal society exposes itself for the true horror it is.All in all, an interesting read, but just go in knowing you might have to re-read several passages several times to understand what the author was trying to say."
5,One of the few useful books on writing a novel,"Of all of the writing books I have purchased, this is possibly my favorite. It truly gives you the tools to address all of the components needed to write your novel. I insisted that a friend of mine read it, but I can't wait to get it back! If you are serious about writing a novel, you must have this book!"
2,For Raw Rookies Only,"This book is very basic, suitable only for someone who is really green and doesn't a clue about novel writing. It would be perfect for a high school senior who has never read a single book or article on subjectand hasn't even previously thought about it. If that describes you, go for it. If you have ANY background or experience in writing a novel, save your money."
5,The best movie ever for kids and adults,I have not seen this movie in almost ten years and I remember it like it was yesterday. I have been looking everywhere for this movie. It is one of the best fairy tales and learning tools for children of all ages. Adults will love the story line just as much as their children. Aileen Quinn gives a wonderful performance. Hellen Hunt also give a wonderful performance. I did not even realize she was one of the characters until I read some information on this movie. Everyone should have the pleasure of seeing this movie atleast once
4,Childhood Favorite,"When I was probably 5 or 6 my mom taped this movie from tv and it was my favorite. The basic story is about the younger good sister, on the verge of becoming a young woman, who is overshadowed by her older mean sister, Helen Hunt. When she meets a very large frog who teaches her how to be a young adult and not a child. Perfect movie for younger children and even older ones. I am so glad that I found this movie I have been looking for it for a while."
4,Very Good,"I watched this movie only once, when I was about ten years old. I must admit, I have never forgotten it and it is one of my favourite movies of all time. I am most disappointed that the DVD is not available; hopefully, it will be eventually...The story is the typical tale about a Prince enchanted by magic, and only true love will set him free. The ""twist"" is in the fact that it is not romantic love that does this, but that of true friendship. Maybe this is why I love it so much...The acting was okay, and the movie did drag at times, but the singing was wonderful... I still remember the songs... my favourites being ""Have you forgotten me..."", and ""Friendship"". They may not be the actual titles of the songs, but if you saw the movie, you know to which songs I refer.Final thought: Wonderful movie; if you ever find it, watch it! (And tell me where you got it!!) ;)"
3,Long Lost Childhood,This was one of my favourite films that was played on Disney Channel pretty regularly in about '89 or so from when I recall it. It is the best Frog Prince movie made and it's such a shame that I have never been able to get my hands on it. This is one that should be brought back from the dead. It is a great story about a young girl who is the tormented younger sister who befriends a tall frog who is a prince. It stars the girl who was in the original Annie movie musical! There is singing in this film as well from what I recall! Recommended for kids!
5,This book is better than the cover!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Once in a Blue Moon. The portrayal of the main characters, Denise and Ian was realist and I felt emotionally involved in their budding relationship right from the first few chapters. In fact, I immediately realized this book was going to be a ""keeper"". I fell in love with Ian myself; he developed from an arrogant, commitment shy loner into a warm, caring and focused individual. Both characters grew and became better people as a result of their relationship; you could see how they brought out the best in each other. I stayed up till 3:00 a.m. reading this book and hated to leave this wonderful love story. I have read several interracial romance novels and feel this book rates as one of the best. The author spends quite of bit time dealing with Denise and her family's negative views on interracial relationships, but its relevant consider the family history"
2,Once was Enough!,"This is the story of Denise Adams (black) and Ian Phillips (white) who end up working on a technology project together. I liked Ian and tolerated Denise and thought that the love scenes were very PG. This novel would have received at least 3 stars but for the significant portion of the book detailing Denise's family who epitomize black bigotry. Denise basically dated Ian in secret, afraid of her family's rejection. The idea that Denise's sister Lynn would literally suffer a stroke brought on by the knowledge that her sister was sleeping with Ian was a joke. Quite frankly if Lynn had died it would not have mattered much to me - that's how ridiculous her views and opinions were. Overall, this novel made race an overwhelming obstacle and detracted greatly from whatever romance there was between Ian and Denise."
5,A beautiful romance novel that happens to be interracial,"I am stingy with my stars and if I'm not mistaken, have only given one other book five stars, but Once in a Blue Moon more than deserves every one of them.Denise and Ian were perfectly portrayed as two intelligent people who fell in love despite the obvious obstacles an interracial relationship presents. Those of us who have been or are currently in interracial relationships know these obstacles are real - they exist. This book doesn't sugar-coat them; rather it holds them up for examination and by the time you're finished reading the book, you wouldn't care if Ian was purple and Denise were from outer space - you're rooting for them!If you enjoy a good romance novel with a plot, some pretty good love scenes and a couple who are truly in love, you don't want to miss this one. Enjoy."
2,Someone will pay!,"""Someone will pay!"" This a line from the book that the heroine's best friend says to her when she finds out she's dating a white man. Someone will pay alright and it will be you if you buy this book. I feel the title of the book says it all. The author writes from the stand point that only ""Once in a Blue Moon"" would a black woman find love with a white man. If this is a shared sentiment then you are sure to enjoy this book. If you live in a more realistic world then do not be the one to pay for it."
4,"It was good,","This was a good read, not the best... after reading reviews on here, I decided to order it, and like other people said... Denise is a grown woman and as long as she was in love and Ian was treating her right, to hell with what her sister Lynn had to say about it. I'll read this again."
2,"Heroine was very inmature, her family unrealistic!!","I thought the writer did a good job of developing the relantionship of the two main chacters. I do feel through that the heroine was very inmature. For godsakes, she is 26-27 years old!!!! Why is she so concerned with what her family approval of, who dates, and marries? The book centered around this topic through out the complete storyline. I got VERY VERY tired of it to be honest. It was hard for me to believe that Denise and her family were educated informed African Americans, living in modern times. I come from a similar type of family that the author was trying to unsucessfully develop. I did throughly like Ian. He was the only good thing about this book.....Buy this book if its on sale.."
4,Wonderful,"Good product! Very convenient. Making tart shells by hand is a truly miserable experience, so finding a good quality, big quantity, pre-made tart shell really speeds things along. Why 4 stars? Although they were in trays, the packing they arrived in was too open/big and not padded well, many shells fell out and there was more breakage than there should have been. Careless packing - that's all."
5,excellent drink,"this s the best instant ginger drink available. not to sweet, just right. i mix it with herbal fruit tea for a real treat!"
5,excellent product,excellent product no imitation about to place another order came in two days great service i'm sold just try it you'll see also bought the sorrel great together
4,Just in case your interested,"This Set Contains (according to another website )Doesn't look like a bad group of movies.I can't comment on the quality, just the selection of movies.Escape from Sobibor (1987)Go for Broke! (1951)Gung Ho! (1943)North Star (1943)Pacific Inferno (1985)Samar (1962)Steel Claw (1961)Walk in the Sun (1945)We Dive at Dawn (1943)Aerial Gunner (1943)They Raid by Night (1942)Way Ahead (1944)"
2,Not a fun hide and seek book,"The pictures in this book are cute. The title suggests playfulness as in a game of hide-and-seek. The text, however, made me sad for this little girl and her family. Hildy is angry at something and expresses it by hiding while her family is looking for her and pleading for her to come out. I would not read this to children for fear that they would ignore the pleas of family to come out and talk about what is wrong - whether it is feelings of being neglected or a child's selfishness in needing attention and doing something negative to have her needs met. Although the ending makes you feel there is genuine love for the child, the story is about her inability to deal with whatever family dynamics are making her miserable enough to run away and hide from her family."
2,"Super Cheesy, for people unfamiliar with Christianity","In short, this book was way too cheesy, even if you were in the mood for something cheesy having just found out you were pregnant. The book focuses a lot on very simple Christian basics and if you've been a Christian for over 15 years like myself, you may feel like you're reading French 101 when you're already fluent in French. I found it very slow and uninspiring. I would have preferred a slightly deeper probing of the Bible as it relates to motherhood, but a lot of the quotes they pulled were a bit of a stretch in trying to relate it to motherhood. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot.If you are a new Christian, or want to give it to someone who is a dabbler in Christianity or unsure of their faith, it may be a decent gift. If you are a more learned Christian who wanted to deepen your faith or discover something new, I would pass on this book."
5,The best book on this subject,"I have read most of the books on strategic alliances. The Strongest Link is the first book I have found that provides practical, insightful, and detailed help on just what I should do to plan, negotiate, and implement these relationships. It will be immediately useful to anyone from a CEO or other corporate executives to managers who have specific alliance responsibilities. Give a copy to everyone in your company who deals with alliances."
5,GREAT BOOK,"his book is a must read for anyone who's involved in Strategic Alliance or seeking to learn more about it. It's very well written, well organized and most importantly it identifies key issues and addresses them with excruciating details. I would strongly recommend it to business managers, people responsible for strategic development, and students."
5,Sexy Scent,"This product is very hard to find and almost non-existent anymore. Thanks to Amazon, I found it online. Buy it while you can."
2,Messed up My Tattoo,"I put this stuff on my Panther Tattoo, made it look like a Salamander. What's Yer Problem? Whatever."
1,"Ladies, do not buy this for your husband!","I bought this for my husband because I thought it smelled really sexy. He started wearing it to work and was attracting strippers from the strip club we have about a mile away. They were following him home and wouldn't stop smelling him. He eventually gave in and was swayed by all the hugs and kisses on the cheek they lavished on him daily.How could I compete with that? They were ""Strippers""! I'm just a ""Regular girl"" with a job that doesn't require me to take my clothes off. Darn, those strippers!He left me the house and children; as all he wanted was our savings and his nascar memoribilia.He had some weird desire to be a limo driver in Bergen County. He was last seen on Route 3 by Rutt's Hutt. I still think of him to this day, whenever I smell Mambo on a man that walks by me.Caution: Ladies do not let this happen to you. Do not let Mambo ruin your life."
4,Impressed,"I purchased this product for my nephew for a Christmas gift. He opened it and I asked him to let me get a whiff of it, now I wish I had of brought one for myself. Very unique aroma, you can't go wrong with this."
5,Mambo makes me do the Jambo...... you dig,"Hey, Mambo is where its at. Driving Camaro IROC down to the Nascar races wearing my Members Only jacket. That is it. Chicks did me, sorry guys. I will leave some chicks for you. Once the Mambo is done, I use the bottle. It reminds me of Sal's rod. So Mambo not only smells good, but the bottle makes you feel like Sal is doing me while I drive. Wooo, gotta go. RickyMan."
5,Great price on a favorite,"No matter how many colognes my better half buys, he always returns to Mambo for men as his favorite. My (women's) Mambo was one his favorites and when a male version came out I bought for him to try and he's been hooked ever since."
2,Not that good,"I don't know why everyone raves about this one, Claiborne has few great fragrances.. plus they use cheap ingredients, so the few that they do have that are good.. don't last long.This basically smells like peaches. The weird part is it smells like somebody spilled this peach fragrance all over a circuit board, the board then fried and mixed with the peaches. I'm not even joking.. this smells like peaches and fried circuits. Not to mention it doesn't last very long at all.You want a good orange-ish peachy scent.. go with Nautica Sunset Voyage.. One of my personal favorites.-The Cologne Guru"
3,I like the smell but......,"I like the smell but it didn't last long compared to my other cologne. I don't know if this is a genuine one. I think it lasts only like 5 hours. I'm expecting it would last until the end of the day. Maybe it's just me, but overall I like the smell."
4,A great value!,"A nice citrus scent that lasts for a long time, I mainly wear it in the evening as its best suited for what would come after and not an all day type of cologne. I receive many nice complements from all women when I wear this. A great value!"
3,Good but not for everyone.,"I only gave Mambo 3 stars because it's not for everyone. If you're all about meetin' girls and meetin' guys and havin' FUN then it's perfect, if not then it's not for you. Luckily that's what I'm all about."
4,For the man with the Playboy mud flaps!,"When your nose lines up with the average size man's armpit, you quickly realize how important a man's smell can be. That's why I wear Mambo. I splash a little on the top of my head and anytime someone leans over to tie his shoe or pick a nickel up off the street, I treat them to what I consider nature's second best stink, Mambo."
3,new Ricky man,"With just a little Mambo, you'll have the confidence to sing the hopey copey at any party!On the flip side, since wearing it, I think I've shrunk a few inches in height, and scream more obscenities."
2,smells like a used car salesman,"not too fond of it. Smells like an old, sweaty used car salesman. Some people like it. Myself and those around me dont... To each their own... this will be the white elephant gift for this year..."
4,MABO COLOGNE FOR MEN,"Fairly pleasant scent, doesn't last very long.Bought this based on good reviews and I do recommend it. For cheap cologne its not bad at all :)"
2,Exaggerated,"Sorry, this cologne isn't that special. It smells very similar to the variations of Axes. It is very strong, and does last; but it smells too much like other cologne. Most of the reviews on this product are bogus; who writes reviews on cologne that they have not purchased through Amazon to say how many guys and girls they attract? Sorry, but your cologne is not going to make you a hit or miss. When a girl who smells nice walks past you in a bar, it probably hasn't significantly raised your chances of approaching her. It bugs me that so many of these reviews are fake methods of advertisement. Look for the ""Amazon verified"" reviews from people who actually bought this through Amazon; not all these fake reviews produced by Mambo..."
3,Nothing special,"This Mambo is ok but nothing special. The smell is just average, not bad, just regular. The bottle is very big so you get plenty of the stuff."
5,Great Scent,An amazing scent that anytime I wear it I get compliments from women and men(if your into that)...I was very happy when I found this product on Amazon because I hadn't seen it in a store in almost 3 years. Definitely a bargain.
4,"Made for a man, strong enough for a limo driver...","I was introduced to this amazing product by an irate, smallish yet strangely endearing limo driver. He kept yelling that he was all about meetin' girls, meetin' guys and was very emphatic about ""havin' fun!"". I decided to base my life on his teachings, so buying Mambo Cologne was a natural next step for me. Now I am at Scores three times a week and I've never been happier!"
5,Great Product!,It came today and I tried it on my wrists...It smells sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo GoooooooooooooooooD!!! GREAT PRODUCT! I would recommend it! The smell lasts a long long time! GOOD BUY!
4,"Dated female lead (1980), but a good story","Back Cover:Every word of his might well be a lie.Adrift in the Caribbean, wrecked against a reef, stranded alone on an island with someone who called himself Mike Scott--- Samantha tried desperately to recall the events that had brought her to such an impasse.Samantha couldn't remember anything--not her name, nor even this tall, suntanned stranger who had saved her from death and who claimed to be her husband.But Samantha had no proof: no papers, no ring, no recollection of those deep blue eyes that kept staring intently into her own. She wanted to believe him --but how could she?I have kept this book since high school so it must have kept my interest for a long time. I wouldn't buy it today, because it's just too implausible for the female lead to have been so wimpy. But that was a big story line 20 years ago. Now it is easy to get strong characters (women and men). But with all that, I really liked this story. See if you can get it at the library."
4,"I liked this book for over 20 years, but now I am giving it away","Back Title Blurb:Every word of his might well be a lieAdrift in the Caribbean, wrecked against a reef, stranded alone on an island with someone who called himself Mike Scott--Samantha tried desperately to recall the events that had brought her to such an impasse.Samantha couldn't remember anything--not her name, nor even this tall, suntanned stranger who had saved her from death and who claimed to be her husband.But Samanha had no proof, no papers, no ring, no recollection of those deep blue eyes that kept staring intently into her own. She wanted to believe him--but how could she.Well, the story is dated with the dominant older male and the young naive female. It is because of this factor that I am giving this book away. But I think the story line was very good and enjoyed it again for one last read. But I really have TOO many books."
1,Praise the lord,I was hoping for something interesting. More than good-god-fearing people at the mercy of non-god fearing people who drink blood.
5,Dark but very interesting,I don't think the idiot in the first review even read this book.This is a very good book for adults (not suitable for children under 13 or 15). It is very well written and developed story. I can easily feel for the characters.If you are into the horror genre and are interested in a well developed and thoughout story then this is a must have. Very well done.
1,taste horrible!,"I buy this based on some recommendations about this brand, well... was a total waste of money, the taste it's horrible, no even near passion fruit flavor, don't know about other flavors/presentations, but the flavor on this it's like cough syrup, I put it directly to the trash can."
1,False Advertising!,"I got the body lift expecting to get what was shown in the picture. I was completely wrong. The kit only includes the blocks, 14 bolts, 14 washers, and a small container of lock tight. Nothing else like the rear bumper brackets were included. On top of it the lock tight was spilled all over everything in the box. Pretty disappointed that I now have to search around to find the other necessary parts and angry that the picture is bs."
3,Do not use the picture as a guide of what actually comes with it,"i was expecting my body lift to have all of the parts in the picture but in reality it only had lift blocks, the bolts, and the steering extension and nothing else at all. But dont get me wrong the blocks are well made and i am able to fabricate and put togther what else i need"
1,I am here at amazon.com looking for a better book!,"This book makes what is easy difficult, what is difficult almost impossible and does not introduce you to 99% of the program. As an example of how unhelpful it is I'll paraphrase what is written at the bottom of page 67: ""push this button and see what happens"". Furthermore, the examples are way below standard. In three words ..... waste of money."

As an example of how unhelpful it is I'll paraphrase what is written at the bottom of page 67: push this button and see what happens! Furthermore, the examples are incredibly below standard. In three words ... waste of money."
5,"Past, Present and Future of Humankind","I have never read a book so detailed in its contents about the history of humankind. I felt as if I was time traveling through each historical period of the great philosophers and learning of their spiritual teachings. Not only does the author describe history, but also speaks clearly about the future ahead for humankind as well. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages!"
5,Beam me up froggy,Vibrant colored kite that flies like a champ. My husband thinks the quality is great (he's an engineer so that is saying something). Easy to fly and my 3 year old daughter loves it. When I initially made the purchase didn't think about the size. Since the kite is larger you need a little bit more wind so we can't take it out as often as my daughter would like. My husband also thinks that the kite flies better than any kite he's owned.
2,frankly disappointed,"where i wanted precision and simplicity i got wordiness and technotalk. where i wanted a concept expanded, i got brevity. i'm very impressed with how smart mr. sunderraman is but not with his ability to communicate his knowledge to me. i didn't come away feeling smarter or more informed. actually, an oracle manual that i'm reading concurrently is more useful. scarey!"
4,Short and to the point,Dr. Sunderraman explains all subjects very well for beginners and even someone with more experience. Gives numerous working examples which is a plus to any book. Gets to the point in a short amount of pages. I recommend it for any beginner in database systems.
5,HOOVER STEAM CLEANER,"IT WORKS JUST FINE, AND EASY TO USE. MUCH BETTER THAN RENTING ONE TO CLEAN WITH.VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE."
3,You get what you pay for with this one,"I was excited to get this on Black Friday- thought I had scored a killer deal. While this steam vac is very small, lightweight,and easy to store, it isn't nearly as good as any of the other vacuums I've used. the cleaning path is so narrow that it took me twice as long to clean my living room and there aren't any attachments to clean upholstery. If I lived in a small apartment, this would make sense, but it isn't going to work out with my large family."
3,Good for the money,"It has no scrubbing bar but it does work on carpet so long as you don't need to fluff up the material. I use mine on berber so it makes little difference... and the machine has no attachments so I do wish I had upgraded to get the attachments.If you have the need for an economical machine, this is the one that works now for 2 years."
2,Disappointed,"I had a Hoover steam cleaner in the past. It was wonderful--much easier to use than rentals, did not wear me out nearly as much, and far less annoying than the Bissell canister I had. When I moved out of state, I gave it to my daughter-in-law. So I bought this one for what seemed to be a good price, put it together, and started to use it. Then I noticed it had no scrubbing brushes like me old ones did. The manual says it does, but it simply doesn't. I am returning it and getting one with brushes. In all fairness, on the swath I tried it on, the return water was quite dirty, so it may be fine for carpets that are cleaned more frequently."
1,no power,this steamer does not have a lot of poweeer to suck the water out of the carpet.did not do very welli recommend you invest in a stronger and more powerful cleaner
4,Good Buy,I really like this shelving system for the bathroom. It was affordable and assembly was simple.
2,"Full of stats, weak on science","On such a sensitive topic, the science must be iron-clad. What is intelligence ? Are there alternative explanations to apparent discrepancies in IQ ? This book is not the place to find answers to these crucial questions."
2,Confounding variables; eurocentric,"The facts in this book are interesting; they need to be explained. This can either be by positing racial distinctions in intelligence testing or cultural bias in the tests themselves or both. The explanation- ""cold stress""- as the grim reaper that selects for intelligence - is eurocentric. (I speak as an English person transplanted to Australia). I have been in the outback; my hat goes off to any people who have managed to survive in it. Richard Lynn needs to argue convincingly that survival in conditions of drought and desert requires less intelligence than survival in cold conditions to prove his point.So interesting facts; intelligence tests unproven as culturally unbiased; possibility of racial differences in intelligence remains; eurocentric explanations of Darwinian processes at work."
3,Eric Sykes,"By 'the intellectually stunted races', are you referring to Americans in particular...? [ after all, 'multiculturalism' is essentially an American export ( or more accurately, Anglo-American egalitarianism - being the main 'instrument' in the destruction of its own race/'culture' ) ].In any case, to attempt to justify differences in races on a purely scientistic level is like a poodle chasing its own tale: race is essentially a metaphysical cause, not a physical effect.In truth, the 'intellectually stunted races' are those without culture... and that just about goes for everyone, these days*. It's a lost cause...* tho' an observation: those races that have succeeded in retaining their race/culture - despite everything... do not originate in the West."
4,Rough but fascinating look at street politics in 1968 Chicago,"Very raw, rough documentary about the riots in Chicago at the 1968Democratic convention, focusing on the unlikely alliance between theBlack Panthers and a group of poor southern whites living inChicago calling themselves the 'Young Patriots' - complete withconfederate flags.Boring at moments, incoherent at others, but overall a fascinatingcapturing of a moment in history where there was the beginning of anunderstanding, now seemingly lost, that the real issue in America isn'trace, but class.A valuable reminder that the politics of the 60s were more complex andmessy than the cliché versions we see portrayed in modern popular culture."
4,Bought this cheap camera for a 4-year-old,"I was shopping around for a decent CHEAP camera, and found this one.The auto light settings are perfect for most environments. The flash is almost useless because it's maximum range is 4.9 feet, yet the focus on this camera is good only for objects just over 4 feet away (further is better). The manual says the focus is good from 2 feet, but that's not realistic.It's small and light-weight, and doesn't eat batteries for breakfast. The pictures taken were definitely better than those taken by $50 and sub-$50 cameras (by a long shot), but about half the quality of a camera costing about twice as much.That is the sweet spot of this camera. It is a good, cheap camera. You get exactly what you have paid for. If you have used any of the really cheap cameras, this camera will exceed your expectations. If you are used to using $200 digital cameras, you will be disappointed, but what do you expect?"
3,NOT for young readers.,"I found this book in the children's section of the library. I'm 10. I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I checked this book out. While reading this book, I cried for hours. There wasn't one single part that even made me smile. (But then again, the holocaust is not supposed to be funny. Maybe German soldiers found it funny, but I don't) I strongly encourage anyone under the age of 14 not to read this. Take my word for it."
4,A great book.,"May people say this book is not for younger readers, which it isn't. It is sad, and It scared me. But theat doesn't mean it isn't good. I cried all through it. There is a lot of bathroom releted stuff, that I really didn't want to hear, but this is one of the best book written about the halcaust. I didn't care for number the stars and anne frank drained on, but this I couldn't put down. Schliender's List, the movie waws probably the best thing aboout them. I reccomand this for mature children, I am twelve, and I was crying but so scared. To be in a situation like that! Imagine it. No toilets, food, water, anything. This is a very moving book, and I suggest it too anyone."
5,Heart Wrenching,"I read this book a few years ago when I was in fifith grade. I was shocked and heartbroken by the time I finished. As you read this book you always know how it is going to end by the lack of hope, the lack of happiness. You never have any illusions, but you try to convince yourself it will be alright, sort of like that poor little girl."
4,Compass Radar,"Works great as advertised. Is much more sensitive than the old Cobra it is replacing. The only problem I have had with it is it seems to lose its compass calibration once every couple of days. Not really a big deal, but it was one of the main reasons I paid extra for this unit, the compass. It always calibrates right back up with no problem, it just doesn't hold it very long. Sometimes it will de-calibrate its self, pointing in the wrong direction. Other times it will just freeze at one cardinal point, like SE or something like that."
1,I bought it on eBay,I give this one star because you cant choose what you want. I didn't want to risk getting this as a pink foot or duck for my son. My husband would be upset if he got a pink toy I think. Plus I want the fingers cuz my son is constantly chewing on mine and his. I'm sure this will be a good teether. Just not taking a gamble from amazon. Get it on eBay.
4,great teether toy!,This teether is easy for babies to hold onto! Very well made and my son loves it!
2,Not what I wanted,"Be careful with this - you don't get to pick which ONE of the four shown. I have a baby boy and ended up with a pink foot. I wanted the hand, but it doesn't let you select which one."
3,the hand teether is good,I wanted the teether which looks like the palm of the hand but i got the feet which is not so good. The fingers are small and can be easily chewed on by babiesbut the feet is not that easy to chew on. But one good thing is they are easy to hold.
5,Great product,I bought the foot shaped teether for my daughter and she loves it! Great product for the money I would recommend this to anyone looking for a teether.
1,disapointed,I have been looking for this teething hand for some time. I ordered the purple hand for my son and recieved a pink foot. I was disapointed first off because it was pink but that it was also a foot. Should not give the option to click on a specific product if you dont recieve something close to to that design. the cost of shipping was almost the same cost of the product so sending back and trying to echange would cost me way more that it is worth.
1,Fun Ice Chewy Teether,There is too big for the baby mouth. My son he's never chew it at all. (*__*).
2,Not a TOY,"I would not order this again. I should not have done so to begin with, but I was hoping for a hand.. I know, big shock, I got the foot! It is too large for the bbay to hold much less get a bite on! I think it is ridiculous that we (THE CUSTOMERS) cannot choose which teether we want. The hand would have been perfect to reach the back teeth and it is a smaller size. The foot is huge and useless.April 2011Now that the baby's foot is as big as this teether I have found you can order the hand at wally world for under 2 bucks! Ordering it NOW"
2,"Too Big for his little mouth, not what I expected...","This product was recommended to me by a co-worker and it also comes with a 'foot' but when I ordered both, I received 2 hands; but in all fairness, the seller had indicated that there is a possibility that I would not be able to get the foot and I was fine with that. My son has yet to take an interest in this product at all. We tried all types of ways to get him to use it especially now that his teeth are breaking but he tossed it on the floor several times and he started to cry each time we gave it to him. It is not ideal for younger babies as it is simply too big. I am not sure if the foot is better but the hand did not work for my son and at all. We had invested in other teething toys which seem to work so much better than this one. This is filed under ""oh well, I tried, but it did not work for us""."
4,Great for Teethers!,I purchased this product for my daughter who is currently in the teething stage. I have to say this is the only teether that I found that could be placed in the freezer. All of the other ones that I have can only go in the fridge. Although they get cold in the fridge they obviously do not stay as cold as long as the freezable ones. Over all this my by far my favorite teether for my daguhter.
1,not varied,"ordered 2 hands and recieved 2 feet. Perhaps the packagers could realize that they could send a hand and a foot. A hand/foot combination can be purchased at target for app the same price. No complaints on the quality or usefulness of teether, I just didn't want 2 feet. :)"
2,They send what they have in stock,"Well, they dont give you the option to choose the shape and colors. I wanted to have this hand shape teether so I ordered two of these, unfortunatelly for me they send me two foot shape teethers. It would have be ok for me if they send 1 hand shape and 1 foot shape. Anyways the foot shape is to wide for my baby's mouth, it result uncomfortable for her. Too bad for me I guess."
4,Baby likes...,My baby likes this product a lot. It's a toss up between the foot and the hand. I think she likes chewing on the toes more than fingers though. It's kind of squishy even when refrigerated. I would highly recommend this item. The price is right too.
5,Biting on hands...,"My baby is always biting on my hands and sucking on my fingers, so she loves this toy as a replacement."
5,Great teether!,"This is a great teether. My son was able to handle it well, even at a young age. He chewed on it even when it wasnt frozen. I also liked that there as a hole in the center so you could hook a pacifier chain or whatever in order to attach it to a car seat or highchair, Etc."
5,Excellent tool to spark ideas and craft a powerful resume,"This book is the perfect addition to anyone's arsenal of career tools. The extensive word lists presented in this book are bound to give anyone's resume a polished, professional, and educated look and feel, regardless of what industry their in. And there's a whole section on proper interviewing techniques too!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST EVER!,"I am a former elemetary teacher, therefore, I have read hundreds of children's books! This book (The Last Safe House) is one of the very best books I have ever seen or read. The story AND the illustrations are wonderful. I read this book to an elderly group and they, too, were totally captivated. Children-YES; adults-YES. ps One of the elderly asked me to order for her grandson. I have placed my order with Amazon and, for sure, I will order again!TRUST ME, (if you are interested in this subject), this book will bring it all together in most enjoyable and informative ways!"
4,THE BEST OF CANTOR,"This was Eddie Cantor's most successful movie and it's good fun. He plays Eddie(!) who lives in Rome, Oklahoma. In the early part of the film there's a beautiful young blonde girl who announces to everyone: ""Here comes Eddie!"" - It's 22 year old Lucille Ball in her very first appearance on film! Eddie dreams he's in Rome of yore and there's hardly a dull part in the whole movie - it's really very funny. Cantor was 41 when he did this but you'd never guess it; the elusive Ruth Etting sings ""No More Love"" and the Goldwyn Girls get into ""Keep Young and Beautiful"". Gloria Stuart of ""Titanic"" fame is young and gorgeous here and Edward Arnold is very modern in his comedy playing. Interestingly enough the film has bookends a la ""The Wizard of Oz"" (although there is no technicolor)and the theme of the film is ""Build a Little Home"" One must remember that 1933 was nearly 70 years ago; if you can't stand the corn, get out of the field!"
5,Classic,"Having seen this movie numerous times throughout the years has given it a special place in my heart. I first saw this film as a young kid and found it entertaining on the physical comedy alone. As an adult I enjoy it now for different reasons of course. The laughing lava gas scene is pulled off by all involved. Eddie was a fine comedian and the cast all shine. Besides it's a fun movie to watch. Sure some of the songs my be corny (as well as the humor) by todays standards, but what fun. I never tire of this one. And can only hope that a younger generation will discover it's magic and overlook the technical shortcomings as well as it's dated format. Enjoy. I know that I will again and again."
3,Fun ride,"Follows the Lagoon Company and their everyday adventures. This series has a couple pretty dark moments that I wasn't expecting. It's a fun ride and the message about comittment is interesting. Good animation, enjoyable characters, fun stoy arcs.It's not super deep in any particular area, but it is a fun ride worth experiencing."
5,An Amazing Series.,"The attention to detail is astonishing in this anime series; seeing it on dvd doesn't do it justice, it really looks A LOT better on blu-ray. The picture and sounds are just so invigorating and you can really dive into the world of Black Lagoon. It's realistic, gritty, surreal, and doesn't pull any punches as the characters curse, shoot, and kill their way throughout both seasons. The dub is pretty good since nowadays most dubs just suck, but whether you prefer subs is really none of my business since everyone has their own personal preference. Either way, you're going to enjoy the F#$@ outta this series. I just wish the OVA would've been bundled with it too, but oh well, can't complain now since I already bought it."
2,Extremely Frustrating,"I bought this book here several years ago when I was freshly back from a wonderful trip to Italy. For whatever reason, I never felt like reading it until last week. After reading the first piece, by Morante, I am not eager to read any further.I knew this book consisted of excerpts from other pieces, but I assumed they would be chosen and edited carefully so they could stand on there own. Sadly, this was not the case at all. After reading the 100+ page excerpt from House of Liars, the piece just stopped dead in it's tracks with no resolution for any of the characters. In fact, it stopped right in the midst of a turning point for all four of the main characters. I was shocked that it ended there.I feel like I paid $13.00 for a ""sneak preview"" designed to get me to buy the books that are excerpted. Thanks, but no thanks."
3,"Canister Purge Solenoid, NOT EGR Valve","Haven't purchased this yet, still researching. This is not an EGR Valve. This is a canister purge solenoid, and according to AC Delco, it does fit a 2000 Chevrolet Lumina."
5,Hitler and Nazism-great reading,"This is an excellent book on Hitler and Nazism, a straight-forward, unbias book on how Adolf Hitler started, and finished. New information in this book makes it fresh to read. Anyone who wants to read a small book (155 pages) about Hitler and get straight to the point should get this book. Packed with pictures, the words and pictures help tell the story of Nazi Germany."
3,A little tinny but good overall,This microphone produces a high treble output (not surprising based on its size) The flexible portion of the arm is a nice feature but over time it gets a little limp.
3,Not Too Bad,"I bought this for speech recognition usingDragon NaturallySpeaking 10 Preferred - Medium Box. It worked, but it also picks up my breathing and anything in the background. It is a little bit too sensitive to be highly accurate. But if you're in a quiet place it should be fine. And it is great for talking to people, no matter what program you use."
4,A good Microphone.,This is a good microphone its easy to talk on and part of the stem bends. I recomend in buying this product.
5,Great compilation,"This ""best of"" cd is fabulous. It really gives you a feel for the B-52's. I recomend it to newcomers; however, I doubt that experienced fans will appreciate it as much."
3,OK But Skips A Deal,"Almost the entire 1st LP is here, some from the 2nd, but the Mesopotamia songs are missing, except the title track which is one of the weakest. A few from Whammy, then we are tossed into their ""message"" tunes. The accompanying booklet is kind of nice, a few rare pics, but obviously doctored and not representing their entire span. Nothing from the pre-recording days, and nothing that doesn't show redhead singer Kate Pierson as a skinny model. She looked a lot like Jabba the Hut on more recent MTV and VH1 specials. Do we really have to hear ""Is That You Mo-Dean"" which lasts for, like, 30 minutes? As with the book about them, you get the feeling so much is being kept hidden. I assume they'll do what most bands in need of cash do every 5-10 years; release ANOTHER retrospective. Maybe we'll see and hear some really rare stuff then. Time Capsule is almost as good, and cheaper."
2,2004 book!,"In computer terms, this is like the King James Version!How about a new book on this 2010 CS5 software? This is almost useless!"
4,Good buy,The product is good but thicker than what originally came with the unit. I like that you can cut it to size.
4,The Canyon,"I read this book this summer along with my daughter who is 12 years old and we both really enjoyed.Mrs. Cole's depiction of the tension-filled friendship between Zac and Trevor, one of the center pieces of the book, was completely convincing. If there is one flaw, it is that the somewhat moralistic overtones at times irritated me. However, since they didn't seem to bother my daughter, I can only assume that is in age problem"
4,Boat Flag,"Great flag to have displayed on our boat when we pull up to the sand bar along with 30-40 other boats, everyone asks where did we get it."
1,Madden 2004 - A decieving game - Another review by Ishkabibble Whosyhimer,"Madden 2004 is not a good game. The graphics stink, the gameplay is way too easy, the sound stinks, and the manual tells you squat about the game. I am telling you, do NOT buy this game. It is a rip off!!!!!"
1,This is one of the WORST games I've ever played,The grphics look like there drawn with a gel pen. The WRs are VERY hard to see and the AI options lack alot. It is less fun then the old 92' games. I wased 30.00 dollers of my hard earnd mony no this trash.Just do not buy this buy this game iit is a waste.
4,Smokin',"If you're looking for a ""band on demand"", this is a great book. A variety of styles makes each song interesting and challenging in its own right, although a couple of the tracks are a little ""too"" commercial sounding...probably just a personal taste thing. Also provides a variety of medium to difficult licks to learn, although some of the ""bonues"" licks don't have an accompanying track to listen too. Buy it, enjoy it!"
1,Not compatible with Canon i850,"Unlike what they said about the product, this ink cartridge is no good for Canon i850. The print out is erratic with this cartridge. They sent me a replacement, but the same problem persists. I shipped both cartridges back. I paid $1.90 for shipping the cartridges back. They refused to pay me the shipping charge of $1.90. They are the one responsible for advertising incompatible merchandise on amazon.com website. Why should I pay the shipping charge of $1.90 when it was their fault?"
5,Hard-Won Wisdom,"In a marketplace where everyone claims to be the best, anyone can sell for less, and no-one can maintain the lead on new technologies, Pugh and Bacon demonstrate that the only way to beat the competition is to out-behave them. Your mission statement means nothing if you don't make it your way of life. The authors place a wealth of hard-won wisdom at your fingertips in the eloquently-written Winning Behavior. Exercises at the end of each chapter lend an interactive feel to the book, making the information more pertinent to the reader's experience. A pleasure to read and packed with profound insights, this book is a must-have for anyone wishing to succeed in any market."
5,A Fantastic Addition to Liturgical Theology,"As a ""regular joe""...I'm not a scholar on liturgical theology...who reads a lot of literature on liturgy, I found this to be absolutely without qualification the best book for history of the liturgy set in a meaningful context for modern times. It is extremely well-written, with little or no technical ""jargon"", so that it's accessible to anyone interested in good liturgy. It's also adequately detailed, with neither too much or too little information in any area. My favorite aspect of it is the way Senn groups the chapters in sensible, practical clusters.Overall, I found this book both enlightening and thought-provoking."
1,terrible...,"the film starts out ok, as a saturday-morning action flick which is decent. unfortunately about halfway through the film i guess they said the heck with it and just went full-blown into full-on cheesiness. horrible pop music, horrible special effects, really it goes from an average period/action film to just unwatchable. first half of movie- 2 and a half starssecond half- 0 stars"
4,summer rider,"In this book, the Saddle Club is continuing their stay at Moose Hill Riding Camp. Lisa has been acting strangely: exercising nonstop and eating very little, and Stevie and Carol are worried about her. Meanwhile, the girls discover that Moose Hill is going to be sold, and not surprisingly cook up a scheme to save their beloved camp. It's them against the developers as they race to save Moose Hill before it's too late."
1,Smelly!,"I usually use Aubrey Organics but found this product at my local Discount Groceries. For one, the lotion stings my face when applied, then smells horrible, like animal products. It is also watery. I'm sorry I bought it, really."
4,Good quality model.,"This is the first of the Hot Wheels 1/18 scale models I've owned. They've done a pretty good job, I would put it on a par with anything from Burago or others in that price class. Nice thick paint, sharp decals for the badges and decent under-car detail including exhausts. Not quite up to Exoto or BBR quality at this price, no engine wiring or cloth seats, but a good, basic, fairly accurate rendition of a beautiful classic sports car."
5,Buy the Audio 550 DSP Ultimate Performance Headset - I did!,"It is rare that a headset delivers what it promised to -- and this is an example of one that does. It is comfortable, extremely clear to listen and talk with on Skype, the only reason I bought it , and I highly recommend it."
4,Good headset!,"I've been using this headset for about 4 months now, and am very pleased with it except the part where my I start getting headache after about 2 hours of gaming, which is not a completely bad thing, just forces me to take a small break and let my eyes rest for a little.Also this headset, when plugged in, blocks all other audio devices. In order to put the sound to my speakers I have to unplug the headset and change prefs to use my mobo surround sound. I'm pretty positive that this happens because the headset is using a USB interface, and there is some kind of conflict between the audio drivers... hopefully plantronics will release a patch for it ... sometime ... hopefully...Software is pretty worthless, but have to have it in order to have good quality sound.Headset is also a bit pricy, but justifies the sound quality!"
3,ok for free,I got this stripper from a combo order with an Ideal compression crimper. It is not bad but certainly not the best. Get one with a finger ring. What this one does have is a springed pivot to put some small amount of presure on the cable and screw adjustable blades to very the depth. You do have to pay attention so you don't end up cutting a curly cue out of the outer shield but other than that not bad. I would not buy these again.
3,The bix theory,"Bix is a genius. anyone who reads the study of Law is aware of this. however, he suffers from an almost uncontrollable desire to use eighty words where only ten would do. Perhaps this is done in order to promulgate the 'self' idea, although in the preface he rather modestly epostulates that he can't compare himself to the leaders in his field.Certain sections i.e. chapter 2 deal with almost existential questions...why? who? but are rather flavourless.However, by the eighth chapter & his views on feminist influences, Bix is well into his subject & his critique is well developed & his construct provides an intriguing perspective on Jurisprudence.This volume is definitely the one 'must read' for all beginner law students, but its text is somewhat daunted, and I fear it will be a 'wade thru' rather than a delight."
3,"""Tea Dance"" Sums It Up","Not ballroom tango, but not really Argentine tango either (at least not the traditional orchestral arrangements). ""Tea Dance"" music sums it up perfectly. Pleasant enough to listen to, but I prefer the Tango Project's first album with the classic ""Por Una Cabeza"""
2,Disappointing,"OK, I realize this is intended for ballroom tango and is not meant to be representational of the Argentine style. That aside, the CD is full of obscure songs and the few that are better known are almost unrecognizable on this disk. The tempo is much too fast.The music on this disk is more evocative of Little Nell being tied to a railroad track in a 1920's silent melodrama than it is the famous tango scene from ""Scent of a Woman"" with Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar.The original Tango Project was great for ballroom tango. I think this CD will manage to disappoint both serious dancers and serious tango enthusiasts."
3,"High quality cases, but very dim light","I have several LED flashlights that produce a pretty good beam. So, I was disappointd with the amount of light these lights emit.The lamp cases are superb. They look very expensive.But if you are looking for illumination, there are much better choices."
3,Malibu Outdoor Metal Bollard,"This is a nice looking set however it does not always light up, the metal dent real easy."
2,Not that happy with this,"It works great, provides light all night long, but the plastic spikes do not go far into the groud on the hard soil we have here. I thought the spikes were metel. That's only my real complaint, I all ready have a broken one and will have to replace it with something to keep it like it should be."
3,Not for accent lighting,"The setup instructions were clear, and the product works well. But the amount of light from each fixture is minimal. These solar lights are good for guiding someone down a driveway, but not for accent or safety lighting."
3,malibu outdoor solar light kit,"This came with no directions whatsoever, just a diagram. Didn't say if the batteries were already charged or not, or what the extra little cord was for. I'm charging the batteries now, I have yet to see if & how it works."
5,Great Product,This Product is a light saver. Works great just like the ones by the pool in Key West I remember. Thanks Gary
4,Shadow of Heaven,"Wow, this was an exciting conclusion to the Dark Matters trilogy. I was quite touched and saddened regarding Kim's love affair but was satisfied with the end or how this 3rd and last book ended. I've enjoyed this trilogy so much even though it's been out in the market for so long. Thank God for libraries! Thank you Christie Golden for this fun 3-book ride on Voyager. Dark Matters is highly recommended if you are a Star Trek Voyager fan."
2,Last of a dying serial,"We have vampires and spirits on tv for sci fi,because writing isn't critical to a show on TV?So far science has no real idea what dark matter isor what it is like.It is just a theory that has a very little observational fact.To start a ""myth"" that is is evil,is probably not a good thing.There wasn't any real discussion of science,just a apology by one of the main charactersfor his behavior.I think they all should be sorry for being picked for yet another Star Trek spin off trilogy?This last book has the usual happy ending..."
2,Disappointed,"This product wasn't what I expected--the portion of the story that takes place when the main characters are 13 is pretty good, but the part that takes place when they are 17 was disappointing. The characters nothing like their counterparts in the movie."
3,Not what I was expecting,"When I purchased the book, I was expecting a paperback not a graphic novel. It was a good graphic novel but not what I thought I ordered."
1,Information isn't up to date,"I travelled with my dog last fall and used this book. About 1/2 of the information was out of date, and it was only a few months old. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Too basic, and lacking focus","If you're considering this book as a basic intro to web technologies, then perhaps it's a decent choice. If you're looking for in-depth details on IIS6, then you should choose another book.The reads an an overview to IIS, SMTP, FTP, etc with no real details on any of them beyond setting up your ""first site"". Pages that could have been used to provide meaningful detail were spent providing overviews of quasi-related subjects like NLB, clustering and Application Center.Microsoft IIS 6.0 Administrator's Pocket Consultant is a much better alternative, providing the type of content I was hoping for when I purchased this one."
1,A waste of time,What an awful book! Nothing is explained in any detail. Jargon and terms are thrown about haphazardly. The author assumes you're familiar with IIS already. He's a real cheerleader for Microsoft on top of it all. (It seems there are no faults or shortcomings with IIS 6.) The writing is very sloppy and typos occur often. What more can I say?
2,IIS 6.0,One of the poorest books of its kind. It told/taught me nothing. Jumps all over the place and there are no in-depth explanations of anything.
2,Too much extra stuff,"I was trying to avoid getting the thing that holds the disks and wanted just the disks. Instead, I got a lot of holders and disks. A lot of waste."
1,No instructions,"There were no instructions as to how many times one could be used, or anythingelse. Are they washable? Whatever.Rather than risk doing something I shouldn't, I just threw them out."
1,Unnecessary unless you have really bad tasting water in your house,"If you use filtered water for making your coffee (i.e., Brita filter; under-sink reverse osmosis filter; built-in filter for your refrigerator's in-door ice and water; etc.) you do not need to filter the water again in your coffee maker. I would only suggest buying these filters if your water is not filtered and tastes bad from the tap. Otherwise, these filters are a huge waste of money."
1,Just a caffeine delivery system,"I have brewed coffee with and without the ridiculously expensive filters and cannot tell the difference. If there was, I still wouldn't pay this much for plastic and charcoal. What were the designers thinking ??? It is just coffee, not fine wine !"
2,Design Problems,"The water filter does not work well with the paper filters.The water filter contacts the coffee grounds in the paper filter orgold basket. All of this makes the gold basket worthless - we don""t use it."
4,Does the job...,It's not the OEM filter made by Mr. Coffee but it does the job...A cost-effective alternative to buying original Mr. Coffee water filters.
4,Coffee filters,"I don't know how much one can say about coffee filters, but as far as I am concerned, these filters are perfect for my machine and as they have a thick carbon core the coffee filtration process is free of any debris."
4,Works good,"These are easy to use and work fine. IF you have a lot of minerals or chlorine in your water, you will want this!"
3,coffee filters,"Not the same ones that came with the coffee maker, but seem to fit in the cage, and work okay."
1,defective,I have been using this item for a few years. The recent replacements came in defective. They would not absorb water and as a result did not filter. I sent them back but have yet to receive a replacement.
5,filter replacements,SO glad I found these on Amazon! I used to be able to just buy them at WalMart but couldn't find them anywhere these days. Simple product but works great!
4,A Very Good Idea,"I never thought much about filtering water in my coffeemaker until I bought the new Mr. Coffee, which comes with a replaceable water filter. I'm already using one of these, and it seems to work very well. In an area with hard water or heavily treated water, a filter is probably a good idea. These fit the filter holder perfectly and seem to be doing a good job, as I'm getting good tasting coffee from my new coffeemaker. We have hard water in NM, so I will definitely be replacing the filters monthly and buying them here."
5,"Great item, great price",I had a hard time finding these filters at a reasonable price. Leave it to Amazon for saving the day! These work great in my coffee machine and I like that they are offered in a 6 pack. Shipped quickly too.
4,so far so good!,"Great price. Cheaper than getting it from the manufacturer. Used it for the first time and so far, so good."
4,makes good coffee,allows us to use sink water instead of bottled water to get that fresh water taste.
4,Hard to find filters - found on Amazon,Who'd have thought to look for coffee filters on Amazon? But that's where I found these! Quick delivery and correct model.
1,Horrible do not buy,"These disk filters do not work; unlike the original filters provided with the coffeemaker, these filters do not allow water to pass through them. Instead, the waters runs around the edges, the filters act like an umbrella. This means the water that reaches the coffee is unfiltered. Even worse, the water runs around the edges of the coffee basket, so that the coffee grounds in the middle of the basket do not get wet. Wish I could post a picture of my coffee basket with dry grounds in the middle - after I tried to make coffee!"
2,Probably not Mr. Coffee,"The product says it's by 'Mr. Coffee', but they arrive in individual, unmarked packaging. They also look different and have different markings than the filter that came with my actual Mr. Coffee coffee maker. Beware!"
3,Awakening,"Using Mr. Coffee water filer replacements, I am sure that my coffee is less impure from the water than from the cheap coffee grinds. One good things is that these filters work in my coffee maker for which I cannot find the correct filters."
3,Cheaper than web prices,I can't beleive what people are charging for these filters.They are cheaper at WAL-Mart. ~$4 for a two pack. That's $12 for a 6 pack.
2,Mr coffee filters,This product was not what i expected. First of all the filters do not look like the original ones from Mr. Coffee Brand and usually Mr. Coffee brand will have the product type/specifications. these ones did not include any information. Mr Coffee filters can be reused for up to 3 months. Not sure about this one.
4,Water filters,"These work very well, and I am glad to have found them at such a reasonable price. I highly recommend them to others."
4,Hard to find at general retail stores,"Have used these filters for daily coffee for over 4 years, and with our extremely hard water, we feel that the coffee really does taste better when brewed using the filter. We're a bit reluctant to replace every 30 batches, as Mr. Coffee recommends, but do replace every 6-8 weeks."
5,Love this filter,I buy these every year so that I have one for each month and I change it religiously! I honestly feel it cuts down and filters out the bad so my coffee is GOOD!
5,Alkalize or Die... It's True!!!,"I have read and re-read this book until some of the pages are tattered! What Dr. Baroody is telling us is to clean up our act. If we all took as good a care of our bodies as we do our automobiles we could probably live to be 120 like the Hunzas. I have Crohn's disease and this book is my 'bible for health'. All of us, every human being on earth, must get their bodies alkaline! Cancer cells CAN'T live in an alkaline environment! All kinds of ailments are chewing away at our insides and we just keep feeding our body acids. Get this book NOW, and use it!!"
3,Disappointed in book,"The book was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner, however, it wasn't what i thought it was. It came up listed under Edgar Cayce books which was what i was wanting. This book has nothing to do with any of Edgar Cayce's writings, that i could tell. It is an interesting book though."
4,The Acid Alkaline Balance Diet,This was a very interesting book about our bodies and how what we put into it effects us.
5,What an eye-opener!,"The author describes the psyche of the food binger in such haunting and graphic terms that I feel that she is describing my own state of mind when I'm binging. She also describes the physical state of the body that causes the appetite to go out of control and whar to do about it.I am an obese individual who, thanks to this book, am on the road to recovery."
1,Nothing new!,"I am totally disappointed in this book. Nearly everything in it I've already read in other books... much of it is word for word! The title is false... there is no ""diet"" or ""program"". In my opinion if you are going to buy a book on this subject, a better choice would be ""Eat Right for Your Metabolism"". In it you'll find much of the same information, better organized, plus menu plans for each type."
2,Not what the title suggest,"Although this book has some useful information it is not as the title suggest. It is not a ""diet"" book. I bought this book because my husband and I are trying to change our diet to a more PH balanced way of living. We have already found that by balancing the PH levels we can all but eliminated acid reflux. When I saw this book I thought it would have a list of alkaline and acidic foods and a diet plan to follow. This book is nothing more than testimony as to what vitamins you should take in order to achieve better health. The test that is referred to is nothing more than taking a supplement on an empty stomach, waiting for results and translating how red you are into the meat eater, grain eater or combo of the two. So again, while there is some useful information I would not have bought this book had I had a chance to flip through it before hand."
2,Disappointed,"While this book contained some useful information, it did not address my purpose of buying the book. I was looking for a lists of foods that were alkaline and acid forming, and various diet plans. In it's place the book contained too many medical historys of clients the author has seen, their treatment, and improvement. For whatever reasons, I rarely find this type of information useful, and feel it is simply a way to fill up pages of a book.Overall, I didn't find the book ""user friendly"" either."
3,Detailed information,"There is a lot of valuable information in this book, but quite involved. If you are very serious about balancing your diet & have a lot of time to devote to the methods involved, this would be a good choice. If you need a simplified approach, this would not be the book for you."
5,Values for today from a tale of 1627,"This is a wonderful, wonderful book. It will help you teach your children about hard work, perseverance, and family. My children want it read to them again and again.Young Samuel Eaton (a historical character) is looking forward to his first chance to help his father bring in the crops. He finds the work incredibly hard, and the coarse grain raises bad blisters on his hands. But he perseveres, and at the end of the day when his father tells him ""you did a man's work today, Samuel,"" we feel his pride.Masterfully written, beautifully photographed, this is a gem in every way."
1,The author should learn elementary arithmetic before writing,"I am appalled at the author and the editorial board of the publisher.Look at tables 1-1 and 1-2 for example. According to the author, the population of the U.S.A. in 1990 was 76.391 billion (=76,391 billion!!!!). And the GDP was 312.8666 Trilluion dollars (=$312,866 billion dollars!!!). Same blunders about other countries in the table 1-1. Table 1-2 has similar BLUNDERS!!!! I have not had the time to go beyond chapter 1. The author did the greatest disservice to students and other teachers by writing this book, because some teachers will ""accidentally adopt it, before they and their students discover that this book is simply a puiece of garbage!"
5,Excellent deal for old movie lovers!,Four fantastic Christmas movies PLUS some rare and touching shorts and trailers - all for an excellent price. Thank you TCM!
3,TCM greatest Classic Films collection.,"This collection is a mixed bag. A Christmas Carol is very good. the Little Shop Around The Corner is good, but Christmas in Connecticut was disappointing. Although the plot had promise, the implementation was contrived and slow moving. I have 't watched the past one."
5,What wonderful holiday fare,"If you are into nostalgia these four old movies are hard to beat. A Christmas Carol starring Reginald Owen was shown every Christmas with the whole family. This is the one version of this great film that rings, ""The Holidays are Here."" Of course, all of the films in this collection are great fun. If you have never seen Christmas in Connecticut, you are missing a wonderful story and superb acting."
5,TMC Christmas Collection,"Great movies to watch, and the added features are fun too! Last year I missed the Christmas shows do to time conflicts and no dvr here! I won't miss them again. Well worth the price!"
5,Movies,I am a Classic Movie buff and this is a set of movies I did not have. Have watched a few of the movies already and I enjoyed them.
5,TCM Greatest classic films collection: Holiday (Christmas in Connecticut ...) fun to watch these old classics.,I like all the movies in the collection. Very enjoyable. I always wanted a copy of Christmas in Conneticut of my own so nowI have it plus 3 more.
5,Great old movies,"This DVD is everything I wanted--four favorite old movies for the holidays, in their original B&W version."
2,Christmas Carol is NOT the Alastair Sim classic as advertised,"Contrary to the claim ""This is the desert-island choice of the many versions of A Christmas Carol, with a magnificent, full-bodied portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge by Alastair Sim that leaves everyone else in the dust"" this is not the Alastair Sim classic. I bought this collection to get two classics -- Sims in a Christmas Carol and The Shop Around the Corner, yet another Lubitsch classic.The version of Christmas Carol included is a dreadful MGM production. And the other two movies are equally bad.Oh well, at least I have my Lubitsch. And for that and that alone I give this collection 2 stars."
2,Only received half of the movies,Very disappointing. Two copies of the same disc were in the case. I'm glad we didn't wait until Christmas to check them out. I have requested a replacement. We'll see how they come in.
1,Product info/details are incorrect,Even though the product detail shows this collection as COLOR. The only thing in color is the DVD Sleeve! All movies are BLACK & WHITE format only!
5,Holiday Collection Classic Films,"My daughter loves old movies and has been looking for the movie, ""The Shop Around the Corner""....I believe it's the inspiration for ""You've Got Mail"", with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. I was very excited to find it and the added bonus is the 3 other movies that are in the collection. My daughter was SO EXCITED to receive this set for Christmas. ...Shipping was very quick, price was excellent. Couldn't be happier."
4,FUN FUN,"fun movies for all types of personalities/ there is something for everyone in this classic set. anyone who like CHRISTmas will Love this set, so do yourself a favor and get this set."
4,Good family holiday fare,"My family likes to ""get in the (holiday) mood just before Christmas by watching these types of classic Christmas movies. These sets (we have several different ones) are an inexpensive and easy to store way to accomplish this."
4,Surprisingly good collection,"I expected ""Shop Around the Corner"" and ""Christmas in Connecticut"" to be enjoyable. But ""It Happened on 5th Avenue"" was surprisingly good. The 1938 Christmas Carol offers a bright, cheerful take on the story, much livelier than the reverent Alaster Sim classic version. So each of the four films offers an enjoyable Christmas entertainment. There's not much by way of supplemental features -- but the Oscar-nominated ""Peace on Earth"" cartoon gave me a reason to cheer. I hadn't seen the cartoon for more than 40 years, but the memory of its powerful images of the last human on earth in the last war on earth had stayed with me. Definitely a piece of cinema history I'm excited to have in my collection."
5,Good Way To Start The Holiday Season,"If you don't have TCM or you want the luxury of watching any of these films whenever you feel like it, this is a good and economical way to do it. With the exception of It Happened on Fifth Avenue (which has been popping up on TCM in the past couple of years and is never going to be a breakout xmas flick in the vein of It's A Wonderful Life, but is still pretty good), the other 3 movies are sure fire winners that are hard to resist and guaranteed to help get the worst Scrooge's holiday mojo started.While none of the pictures have been remastered, the master prints from which they've been copied are in decent shape. For me, it is all pretty irrelevant anyway since I just really like them and have watched them over and over again with each new holiday season. Given the bargain pricing, this is a great way to beef up a holiday movie collection."
5,"Great, wonderful","The DVD arrived in great shape and on time. I am very happy with the product, would deal with the company again in the future."
4,Enjoyable Holiday entertainment.,If you like good old fashion entertainment you will enjoy this classic collection for the holiday or anytime during the year.
3,Not What I Ordered,All of the discs are piled on top of each other in the jacket. They are not packaged as stated. Very dissappointed!
5,Enjoyable Christmas Movies,Great price for 4 classic Christmas movies! Best of all they can be watched by the entire family and everyone will feel uplifted by each movie.
3,ok,"One of the movies didn't work of the four was defective, the others were fine. Of course it was the one I really wanted that didn't work. ""The Shop Around the Corner"""
4,holiday classics,definitely a necessary addition to your holiday movie collection - and a phenomenal price for all four!
2,Case broken and movies loose,When I opened the box the case was broken. Pieces of the plastic were loose inside with the DVDs that had come loose as well. Some scratches. One of the movies works so far.
3,Inexpensive,"I bought the set because it cost no more than buying the best movie in the set, ""The Shop Around the Corner."""
4,Christmas at Your Convenience,"I only bought this set for ""Christmas in Connecticut"", a classic holiday movie. I've never seen the other three movies on television and have yet to view them on the DVD."
4,Okay,"I only have watched one movie so far--The Shop Around the Corner--the original movie that inspired the movie You've Got Mail with Meg Ryan starring as the owner of her very own bookstore named ""The Shop Around the Corner,"" the British Comedy Series ""Are You Being Served"", and I believe a 1940s version of ""The Shop Around the Corner"". The only thing I disliked was the ""suicide attempt"". I find movies featuring this and other negative aspects are responsible for the blood and guts spillage you see in movies today, video games, but the worst in every day life on the streets of America. It actually turned me off, so I have lost interest in watching the remaining three movies."
5,Very good,"I bought this for my mother as a Christmas gift, but couldn't wait to open it and watch them with her. It's nice bonding time between her and I to watch these classic Christmas movies so she can remember her childhood and share it with me."
3,Fun but simple,"This game is fun, and if you like solving puzzles this game is for you. My only complaint is that even at the highest diffulty setting it really is quite simple."
3,Dissapointment if you are expecting Mario vs. Donkey Kong I GamePlay!,I was really into the first MvsDK game! I preorded this but was disappointed when I started playing. It's annoying to use the stylus... and where's Mario? You just have the little wind up guys to push around... and they're not even cute like they were in the first game. A disappointment all around. I quickly sold it. I love Nintendo games but like Metroid for the DS it's too much to hold the DS in one had and push the stylus around while squinting into the screen. I like progress in gameplay and commend Nintendo for being creative but it's just annoying. Why can't I just play with the control pad while I'm laying down? I love to lie on the couch and play the DS but the way the control system is set up it's impossible. I would almost say this game sucked because the first one was so fun. Why mess up the formula?
3,Poor quality,"When we received the game, it was is very poor condition. I was aware it was used, but I barely plays on my sons ds. Overall, I was disappointed with it. It only works maybe half the time."
4,Raw fun,"Nintendo really knows how to make games better. It was simple, fun and accessible to all ages. Worth trying."
2,Letdown,"I remembered seeing commercials for this game way back when it came out, and it reminded me alot of an old pc game called Lemmings i usto play WAY back when....well, it wasnt anything like it, nor was it fun in almost any way."
3,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good game, but it suffers from flaws. Pretty much the way you control the Minis, it's too difficult in many places. Trying to get 100% in each level is over-the-top hard because of the way you have to try and concentrate on every single Mini everywhere on the level, which causes you to lose sight of at least one and that one to die. It's fun if you can get it, but there are a lot of frustrating parts. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,Great,"Wow i love this game. If i were to compare this to the first one it would kick the first one all the way to China(From USA)! The only bad thing is that once you beat it, it gets extremely boring.Graphics: B+Controls:AStory line: B+How fun: BPrice: C"
4,"highly enjoyable, highly accessible, full of lush melodies and colorfully orchestrated","See my more detailed review under this set's other entry:Rodrigo: Concierto de Aranjuez; Concertos; Orchestral Works [Box Set]. It is a reissue of four well-filled discs (each over 70 minutes) first recorded and published by EMI between 1980 and 1985, and now also available as a cheap EMI set:The Rodrigo Edition (4 CDs): Concertos & Orchestral Works Conducted by Enrique Batiz.The music breaks no grounds but it is highly enjoyable, highly accessible, full of lush melodies and colorfully orchestrated. The language is that of the post-Debussy/Ravel ""musique franaise"" and ""musique espagnole"" written in the first half of the 20th by composers such as Sauguet, Milhaud, Ibert or Falla, with late-Romantic outbursts pointing to British composers like Delius or Bax. At that price, it is no doubt the best possible introduction to the music of Rodrigo."
1,Disappointing,"Personally, I am a big advocate of LGBT Issues and like when art tackles the issues of race and sexual orientation, but when the main character ""ended up"" being a Lesbian at the end of the book with ABSOLUTELY NO HINTS IN THE FIRST 75% OF THE BOOK, it showed that the author is completely oblivious to the Gay community and just sort of threw it in there.Leading up to the horrible ending, the book itself was a little silly, and I the dialogue was predictable and got old fast... really fast."
5,Excelente CD. No se lo pierdan!.,"Tuve la oportunidad de conocer la musica de Patricia Sosa gracias a unos amigos Argentinos. No duden en comprar este CD. Quedaran maravillados de la fuerza que transmite esta cantante Argentina. Tiene una voz excepcional y las letras de sus canciones son buenisimas. Hay de todo, desde canciones romanticas y suaves a canciones con gran fuerza y ritmo."
5,T. DeWitt Talmage,"I admire T. DeWitt Talmage who was a great, great preacher from yesteryear. I have 20 volumes of his sermons, and they are priceless. This book is equally good."
3,Ordered the Wrong Cord,I ordered this cord by accident. The cord came in great condition with no problems. I just gave it a lower rating because I received it in the mail and realized it wasn't the right cord for the project I am working on.
4,Early project by Wolfgang Press members,"2005 mail-order only release by 4AD of a long out-of-print album (CAD 107 CD) from 1980. After Rema-Rema split, Gary Asquith, Mick Allen, and Mark Cox formed arty post-punk outfit Mass with Danny Briottet. The quartet debuted in 1980 with the ""You And I""/""Cabbage"", following it up a year later with their sole album Labour Of Love. The group subsequently split into two halves: Asquith and Briottet formed Renegade Soundwave, while Allen and Cox remained with 4AD for their new project, The Wolfgang Press.The album features both sides of the single and additional artwork including reproductions of original show flyers.1 Mass 9:432 Why 1:093 Ill 5:274 Why 1:225 Isn't Life Nice 2:266 Elephant Talk 3:597 F.A.H.T.C.F. 7:218 Cross Purposes 4:319 Innocence 6:1210 You And I 4:2711 Cabbage 5:34"
2,Predictable,"Everything about this book was predictable: the romantic side story, the dialog, the plot, the descriptions.... the writing felt tired, over-wrought and cliched. I gave the book two stars simply because it made for fast, easy reading on a long travel day, but that's about the best I can say about it."
4,"Well written, thought provoking stuff. Highly recommended.","As the father of a 12 year old daughter it was naturally her that enveloped my thoughts as I first got into Rash's novel, which revolves around the quest to recover the body of a drowned child from the river that took her. As the plot unfolds though, it is not the terrible loss of the young girl that takes centre stage, but more the nuances of Rash's finely drawn characters and his questioning sense of what is right and wrong. Just 237 pages; by the end you'll be wanting more."
4,A joy,The writing is the payoff here. Lyrical and smooth it floats us thru a grim story of loss and regret. The pages fly as the characters come to grip with human fraility.
3,Masterful use of language,"Always love Rash's writing. This one, however, feels a little rushed. The pace of the events is very fast-moving and the characters needed to be fleshed out a bit more. Or else it could have been cut down into a novella and surrounded with connecting stories. Definitely worth reading, though."
5,great,this thing looked brand new. great service it was in really good shape the price was wonderful. even know i hate reading i had to get this book but it did come in good shape.
2,Pick up a newspaper instead,"After really enjoying ""one Foot in Eden"" I had high expectations for this novel and ended up being very disappointed. The first novel was so unique, while this one was terribly boring. The entire book centered around the battle of environmentalists. If those type of causes are dear to your heart you might enjoy this book, personally I'd spend my money on his first book instead."
2,Interesting concept but...,"The concept of the book was interesting but quite frankly didn't hold my interest. I normally don't mind books that jump between different perspectives. This one though just didn't have enough to hold my attention. I felt it very predictable very quickly. To the point that I got bored, read the last 10-20 pages and probably got the gist of the whole book. I'm giving it 2 stars because I did like his descriptions and story line from what I did get through.I'm only glad that I bought it at a used bookstore for a fraction of the cover price for the paperback."
5,Brilliant American History,"This is funnier than the John Adams bestseller, better written than the Ben Franklin bestseller, and smarter than the Harry Truman bestseller. Those who are buying into all the lionizing of Reagan in all those one-sided, nearsighted encomiums, should read this book, to see how a real historical giant can be presented truthfully, with a merciless mirror, and have his greatness still stand out."
5,Filling a Gap,"This is a wonderful addition to both the story of Washington and an insight into the way his generation considered ""the west"". I have read many books on this periiod and have never heard anything about either Washington's trips west nor about his scheme for the Patomac River. He also places this scheme in the context of the other attempts to bring the west into better contact, both econmically and as Americans. In all, a valuable addition to the study of the period."
2,Better to watch Discovery Channel,"Okay, but it's pop history that only die hard buffs will want. Weird paradox, huh? Try Wiencek's An Imperfect God."
2,Table Way TOO Unstable!!!!!!,"I was looking so forward to receiving this table for my Mom's chairside. It went together easily in a few minutes. It has a beautiful oak top (however it came with a small chunk missing on the back edge covered with brown stain). I am returning this table because it is just way too wobbly for use by my 88 year old Mom even under a couch, bed or chair. I tried adjusting the height of the nobs under the legs and also tried putting felt tips on each leg because I have a hard surface flooring but nothing worked so back it goes."
3,Ok for the price,"It shipped quickly & was very easy to assemble. Allen wrench included, no other tools needed. Sturdy enough for my laptop, very ""industrial"" looking. There are a few chips in the wood finish. The thin veneer over solid wood has flaked off in some spots on the sides & edges, but could be repaired or stained."
5,Sturdy little table,"It arrived in a good amount of time and was very easy to put together. It has already survived a charging dog who knocked it over on a tile floor and not a scratch and it held up fine so it's pretty sturdy. It didn't fit under my couch as shown in the picture because I have two recliners on either end of the couch and there is a metal bar under the front edge that won't allow it to snug up. Also, my couch has two oversized puffy arm rests and it wouldn't fit over those either. So I just stand it next to the end of the couch and use it as a mini side table. That's not really how I wanted it to be, but it will do."
5,Buy it,"If you what a thick piece of REAL wood that has class, buy it. The black metal is nice also. But do not be surprised if you have to spend an extra 30 seconds putting it together as the metal stand has to be lined up as it is not a cheep stamped out piece of metal."
2,"Love the table, hate the scratch","The table was exactly what I wanted, unfortunately there was a deep foot long scratch in the wood. It wasn't scratched in shipping because the box was unopened and the table was firmly surrounded with bubble wrap. I didn't want to return the table so I tried to fill in the scratch with a stain but that didn't work, so I am using it with the scratch until I have time to sand and restain the top."
2,poor construction work,on the 2 bottom rails on both tables the screw holes were not drilled properly and the screws could not be advanced into the holes to set the tables structurally .............. i had to tape the rails together to create a modicum of stability.....i did not report because replacement ones must be out of the same inventory........the tables look nice but there are stability problems
5,Rustic tea table,"This table works great for us when drinking coffee in the morning on our patio. The table is very stable and easy to slide under our furniture, its perfect for our use."
4,pretty good table,"Looks just like the photo. Arrived promptly with all part and pieces. Easy to assemble. Not the most solid and sturdy, but good quality for the price."
1,Very Poor Quality Construction,"The quality of the construction of this table is very poor. I would return, but I decided to keep it due to the hassle of returning. One bolt on the bottom frame leg would not tighten. The frame sections due not align properly inside each other. Overall the table looks good when assembled but I had to make some modifications to tighten the frame so that it want wobble. This should be a $25 purchase instead of a $60 purchase."
3,chintz and old lace,Would have been a better read if it told us more about Sister. More color illustrations would have been a plus. A better read is the life of Nancy Lancaster
4,"Great lady, great read!","One of the legendary designers of any period - this book by the granddaughter and daughter of Sister Parish is a terrific testament to the legacy this lady left on the decorating world. It's chatty without being gossipy, plus you get a real feel of how Sister decorated. Thoroughly enjoyable and readable!"
2,Oh Brother!! Don't Bother.,"Sister should have been a funfilled ,gossipy journey into the life and mind of a great decorator. Instead it is repetitive laundry list of furniture and chintz and innuendos.The book could have been made at least bearable if it had contained pictures of the beautiful rooms that are described in minute detail.A far more interesting book is the Parish Hadley book."
3,Helpful,"This book was helpful getting me started with my thinking regarding a mother's day out.But it is old and some information is outdated.Plus, most mother's day outs in my area are church related and this was a home based MDO advice book."
5,David E. Meadows - Sixth fleet,Excellent book and series. This author knows his material and keeps my attention. I am looking forward to his next work.
3,Baker's View,"I was quite disappointed in this book. It read like a political document advocating the creation of an new Arab state. Although it tried to pick up where the first volumn left off, I don't feel it was very successful. Of the two books in this series, the first one was much better by far."
5,Great for keeping a short beard or stubble look.,"I bought this trimmer for the purpose of maintaining a short stubble look. For this, it works wonderfully. The setting wheel goes all the way down to 1 mm. After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I ended up buying it at Target for $30. Have not regretted the purchase."
5,Worked great for 5 years,"When buying a pair of clippers you have to think, $20-$30 for something that will save you a ton of money in the end. I watch poeple get $10 haircuts every 2-3 weeks, insane. Think about it, saves about $25 a month for a year equals $300. After 5 years I saved around $1500 on haircuts. That covered alot of books and such during school.So I have had this product for over 5 years, all through college, and it has been wonderful. I cut my hair every 8-10 days, I like to keep it short, and shave my face with it every 3 days...no problems at all. Plus the adjustable length is really nice, no switching the clips all the time, just dial it and go to work. I will be buying it again here shortly."
5,panasonic trimmer great,This trimmer runs smooth and cuts affortlessly. Has easy to use adjustments and panasonics often last long time. great buy!!
2,Flimsy plastic guard,"Mechanically the shaver works just fine. However the guard is made of a flimsy plastic, is hard to remove from the shaver and breaks easily. Regardless of how well the shaver works if the guard breaks it's useless. I will not be purchasing another one."
1,not meant for bear trimming,this product is not worth purchasing for beard trimming. it does not cut evenly. The plastic clips bend causing an uneven trim. This product is costs too much when you can buy something equivalent for a lesser price.
3,"Fairly good shaver, flimsy comb attachment","I've had my shaver since my birthday in December of last year. It works well, but the comb attachment on the top of the shaver breaks easily. I contacted Panasonic's customer support and they are sending me a new comb free of charge. I saw the other reviews here and mentioned that other people were having the same problem."
1,Broke in two months,"When I first started using this product I was very impressed. I trimmed my beard every few days, and even had my girlfriend give me some nice haircuts. I was saving time and money and looked great. The battery stayed charged and mechanically was easy to use.Then, less than two months after I bought it, the trimmer became unresponsive. Switching the power button on and off did nothing. The trimmer had been in the charger for 12 hours, with the charging light on, to no effect. Amazon tells me I cannot return the product because it's been over a month, so I might try and contact Panasonic.So, very disappointing to say, but do not buy this product if you would like it to work after 50 days."
1,Completly useless,"I have a 20 year old panasonic trimmer which is made in Japan.I decided to buy a new one after the battery died.My old trimmer does a much better job than this new one (which is made in China ...)I used the blade without the plastic adapter, and the blades get clogged with hair after a second or two, and then the blades become completely useless.I couldn't return this item because I used it once, and amazon won't take it back ...I don't expect them to sell it to another guy, but it kinda sucks to get a $5 refund on it ..."
3,ok beard trimmer,does the jobsomewhat awkward design.....took a while to figure out which was cutting surfacecutting length dial must be carefully used......easy to slip back to minimum length which could cause a disaster.
4,great product,"I bought this to replace the same product (about 6 years old) and which had developed a battery problem -- it would only run when connected to 110VAC. The battery on this guy is notreplaceable. But at this price, who cares?"
4,2nd trimmer of the same type,"Will buy again. I trim hair and beard constantly with this trimmer. Works nicely. Lube blade every other use foe good results. Like i said 2nd I have bought, satisfied. Advice- rinse guard- do not tap trimmer on sink bowl, guard will crack in same area ( weak spot). Guard broke again bc I did not follow my own advice. RINSE the guard!!!!!!!"
5,Was a gift - He couldnt be happier,I bought this razor as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. He mentioned that he was very happy with how much precision the razor has. He can both shave and trim easier than any other razor before. Great razor.
3,Great idea,"This product is a good idea, the attachment is good for really long hair, not too good for Afro American hair. The clippers don't get that close on a fade cut. Bought it for my son to cut his own hair great starter."
4,"Works well, but watch the setting","I was very pleased with this beard trimmer. It works very well, and has the necessary adjustment to trim a beard to any desired length. One cautionary note - if you push the end of the comb/guide to make sure it is seated, the trim length setting will inadvertantly be reset to a shorter setting. I almost ended up running a very short trim path through my beard."
4,Great little timmer for $30,"Pros:1) Rechargeable2) wet and dry3) adjustable guard4) cordlessCons:1) Slow charge2) Blade is not full width of head3) guard adjust doesnt seem to lock adjustments very wellThis is a great little trimmer if you want to use while wet. i liked the fact that it was cordless so you wont have any cord to tangle when your trimming the back of your head or other locations. Easy to clean, you can just flush it under running water. The built in adjustable guard means that you can adjust the length of hair without taking the guard off. However the locking mechanism doesnt seem very strong for the adjustments. if you push too hard on the guard, it will lower the cut length. Charge time seems to be a little long, 16 hours for a full charge! This is of those great all in one packages. theres only two pieces, charger and the trimmer. great for short trips if you need to trim all the time with out lugging around a large set."
2,Caution when using this product .....,"ASIN:B000KEAA2Y Panasonic All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer Washable Grooming Trimmer - Silver [Model ER224S]--While the cordless feature is convenient this device does NOT provide the precision necessary (especially on short men's cuts) and will not cut well without pressing it further into the hair and then it will TAKE OFF MORE THAN YOU BARGAIN FOR !!!!! Have tried to work with this device more than once without success... and there is more maintenance required of this device than the device noted below.I have used the remington that have combs that need changing out with no problems whatsoever. This is the one that you can get from the drugstore.Remington HC-8017 Precision 18 Piece Haircut Kit Corded. Even if you are an individual trying to use this on your own head for a quick trim, there is much less chance of an error with the remington.Anyone with suggestions on how to use these new models with the dial a combs- I'm all ears..."
1,Broke 2nd use.,"Refer to RW's pictures at the top. Panasonic needs to lose some points on the style of this thing to reinforce those weak spots. My guard broke on the second use, leaving me with a nice bald spot. I would have sent it back to the manufacturer for a warranty repair but considering it was a design flaw and not just a bad one I couldn't possibly have trusted the replacement. I just went ahead and ordered a nice Wahl one instead, with those replaceable comb guards."
3,"cuts well, but not very sturdy","I bought it to cut my son's hair. The pro's are: it's cordless, there are no interchangeable guards, it cuts well. The BIG con is that I dropped it once from a height of about 3 feet and it broke. It was nice while it lasted."
3,Average Quality Trimmer,"I bought this trimmer to replace a 10 year old Panasonic that was great. I am disappointed in the quality of the cut. After the first use, I looked at the ER224S and it is made in China. I looked at my old trimmer (ER389), and it was made in Japan........enough said."
5,Works as it should,"Easy to use. Nice even cut at any length. I can see what others mean about the plastic part and that it might break -- but for me, I don't really take it on and off, so not an issue -- although it could be made with a heavier gauge plastic, i don't think its quite as delacate as others make it out to be.I'd buy it again!"
2,Hasn't broken yet!,"I've had this trimmer for about 3 months now. I was very skeptical because of all the reviews I'd seen about it breaking very easily. Well, I can't say anything about breaking but this last week I pushed down so hard on it that went from the 8th setting to a 0 and took off half my beard off with it. Still works great but I don't trust it much anymore."
3,"Okay, but there should be better out there","I had this for almost two years, and it was decent but not great. It cut hair okay. My kids didn't like it because it would catch on theirs, but I didn't notice anything more painful than most when cutting my hair. The guard is a little large which made it hard to do some beard trimming in areas around my face specifically the chin area even at a low setting. It was nice to have so many lengths to choose from, but ultimately like other reviewers have pointed out, the guard is to flimsy and broke for me. Once the guard breaks its basically useless to have it lying around. It was worth it when it worked, but I wonder how much more I could have paid for something that would last longer."
3,Plastic Guard broke,"An awesome product! BUT the guard broke somehow. I didn't bang it on the counter or throw it down to break it either. One day, it just broke! I got it for X-mas too:( I would like to continue to use it--but I can't. I tried to superglue it, and also wrapping a rubber band around it...nothing worked! If anyone knows how to get ahold of another plastic guard--let me know!"
4,Lasted a good year and a half before I jinxed it.,My order arrived in December 2009 and I've regularly used it since. The trimmer did a great job on both my face and my head until two days ago when I jinxed it by thinking to myself how well it had lasted me so far. The plastic comb attachment broke on the side and even super glue couldn't keep it in place.To sum it up in one sentence:It is an excellent trimmer until it breaks.I need a new one now.
4,I like it,"i just bought it month ago, it is good until now, but i dont know how is it as a long time device. i hope if they change the colors"
4,Panasonic beard trimmer,Practible and proper for home-use - not for professional employement.8-hour charging time allow about 45-min continuous operation.Blades allow precise trimming.
3,great trimmer - cheap flimsy plastic hair guard,"In less than a year 3 of the plastic hair guards self-desctructed. The flimsiest thingies I have ever seen and they are covered only by a 30 day warranty. Otherwise, the trimmer is excellent."
2,good quality shave - flimsy plastic head,the shaver is great - lasts on g on charge - good quality blades...etcthe head is flimsy plastic and will break after any significant use....you can do better with remington or braun...
3,Flimsy comb,"Absolutely agree with other comments/complaints: great trimmer, would be perfect if it weren't for the flimsy plastic comb, that inevitably breaks. I've bought replacements that broke as well - now it's glued, but won't hold for too long, with frequent removal to access the bare blade for trimming sideburns!Does anybody at Panasonic read this, surely they must get complaints and it's puzzling that no one has done anything to improve the design, or use sturdier plastic!"
2,Hum...cheap...in both price and quality,"I just got this last couple days and I couldn't wait to give a try. The initial use was not very pleasant; the blade stuck in the middle of cutting and it HURT! In terms of the quality and the ""feel"" is totally not what I have expected from Panasonic at all. I got a Panasonic electric shaver for my X'mas and I am still very happy with it...So I guess the difference between them is quite clearly where it is made in. This model is ""made in China"" and the shaver I have got is ""made in Japan"". So next time I will look for ""made in Japan"" for the new one!"
3,"Yes, it is flimsy.","I don't know why the comb hasn't broken for everyone. Mine dropped on the floor and broke too much to use. Even prior to that, one of the comb's blades broke off in normal use. The comb doesn't allow one to trim close under the nose; the mini blade must be used."
2,murfats,"I finally give up! Love the trimmer, BUT I've had to replace the comb 3 times in one year. Very flimsy plastic."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought two of these and both times the comb attachment broke! When I called Panasonic to get a replacement attachment, they wanted to charge me more than I paid for the clipper! When I told them that the clipper was only 2 months old, they told me that I still had to pay for the attachment and the shipping! I know that I am not the only person to have this problem and I will never buy another Panasonic grooming product! This attachment is super flimsy and made to break and the clipper is absolutely worthless without it. I have never broken a comb attachment in my life and I have been cutting my own hair for 30 years. My next clipper will be a quality clipper from a quality company, instead of a piece of junk with even worse customer service!"
2,Plastic guard is flimsy,"This trimmer is ok except for one huge flaw, the plastic guard is flimsy and the tines break off very easily. I used this trimmer to buzz my head and while it did a decent job, the plastic guard quickly started losing tines and eventually the whole thing snapped in half. You can kind of use the unit (just for buzzing) without the plastic guard but it is not very comfortable. For most people this trimmer would be completely unusable without the plastic guard so it is a big problem. A couple of the tines broke off mine when I tried to buzz my head while I was sweaty. For some reason this prevented the unit from gliding like it normally does and the plastic pieces are so thin they just broke right off. So for months I was using it with a big gaping hole in the middle of the plastic guard. Then recently the whole guard just snapped. I've only had this unit less than two years so considering the price I paid for it, I just don't consider that a good deal."
1,Comb is not warrantied,"4/1/11: I just called Panasonic warranty to verify whether or not the comb falls under the warranty, since numerous people have complained that the comb breaks easily and that Panasonic does not honor a warranty on it. I was told by someone in the Phillipines that the comb is not warrantied, ""because it is a replaceable part.""However, the warranty on this product is now allegedly 2 years, so you will now have 2 years during which the broken comb will not be warrantied."
2,"Ascetically pleasing, practically usless","Does not reach top half of mustache, under nose, because of length of guide comb. Goes from a ""5"" to a ""3"", so if you want beard to be ""4"" it will be too long, or too short. Other than that it is good. I just don't like to have to have a beard trimmer, and then a mustache trimmer- wasted money."
2,"flimsy plastic guard, needed to BUY a replacement after 5 uses on hair longer than 1.5 inches","The trimmer works although longer hair easily jams it (about every 5-7 secondsof continuous trim).As all longer hair is inside the ""comb attachment"" (CA) or the plastic guard, one needs to frequently take the CA off, take out the hair and put the CA back. It requires certain force to do that every time but that same force is often enough to break the flimsy marvel of poor engineering. Mine got broken after 5 uses on the longer hair (1.5-2.5 inches). A call to Panasonic led to a discussion with a tense sales guys Jack who has revealed that I need to buy this item from them. Have not bought yet, as ""other people have that in their database"".Short hair (1/4 inch) is OK.In the complex world of hair trimmers a comb attachment often separates a good product from a poor one. And vice versa."
2,Very messy,"This trimmer throw the hair everywhere. And cleaning it is very difficult, the hair will be stuck inside the blade."
2,Has a few major issues,"The Head piece keeps braking, and I need to glue it since I can't find a replacement. Also its too bulky to trim your mustash . its just not built well."
1,do not buy this clipper,"This clipper is the worst buy I have ever made. Thought ""panasonic"" brand is good, but the clipper catches all the hair and you have to remove it every 5 sec, otherwise you cannot cut. To do that you have to remove the comb, which is another headache, the design is just not working. Do yourself a favor and buy a simple clipper, or if you want to spend 120+ $$ get an oster..."
2,Okay while it lasted,"I bought this several months ago, but already I need to look for something else to replace it with. The plastic trimmer guide is just too fragile. I have been through THREE replacement plastic pieces (they are available to order on [...] and aren't too expensive), but removing and putting it back on strains the weak plastic. (The first time it broke was my fault for knocking it on the floor). If they would have made it out of a stronger material, this would have been perfect. It would also have been nice if they included a stand for it. It sits in the charger in the wall, but there is no on-off switch on the charger, so you must remove it when charging is complete or risk ruining the battery. Good concept, but is just not sturdy enough for my use."
1,The Adjustable Guard Design is Awful,"The clipper itself is a bit underpowered, but the real problem is the guard design. It was constantly getting hair built up under the guard - so much so that I could do about 2 passes over my head, then I would have to shut it off, remove the guard and knock out the hair. Haircut would take 15 minutes, and up to 20 minutes with my son. Used it maybe 5 times before buying a real clipper."
3,panasonic er224s shaver,"This is an okay trimmer, I actually use it for my head hair it works good, but could use finer adjustment, each increment has a little to much adjustment between."
1,Designed for failure,"I liked this product very much while it worked. However, the plastic guard is VERY flimsy. It broke after about 20-25 uses. I can't find a replacement part, so the product is now non-functional. I am VERY careful & gentle with my things, and this is totally rare for me. In my opinion, this is a design failure. Very unfortunate, because if that part held up, I would like the product very well. A shame.I uploaded a photo, with red circles around the breaks, at the top of the page, under the main product pic, so you can see."
1,Do not buy for a beard or body trimmer,"I had bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco T960, which was wonderful until the battery died. I have currently gone back to the old Norelco (keeping it plugged in while grooming) until I can find a suitable replacement.The guard and blade design of the Panasonic make it almost impossible to trim your beard or other body hair. The cutting blade is in the middle of the huge guard. Making it impossible to position the trimmer in any direction that will allow it to trim your mustache while your nose is still on your face... :)The guard itself is so large that my slightly curly beard hair will not follow the guide to the cutting head. Trying to use this trimmer was an exercise in futility.Might be good as a head/hair trimmer, haven't tried it for that, but for a beard/body hair groomer it is useless to me. I think I will give it to charity."
5,"Cordless, with resizable comb",The fact that I do not have to change from one comb to another is a great design feature of Panasonic ER224S among others.I cut my hair with comfort. Great product.
3,Question regarding spare parts,"How to replace blade, plastic guard and other spare parts? The rating by me is not official, I will rate later"
3,Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver),Haven't open to use this item yet. It is ok for cut general hair everyday.
4,Works great,Works great. Trims very well. Not afraid it will gnash my face like some trimmers. Charges well and keeps charge for a long time (for now). Don't like that I have to pull the plastic-sizer to get to the detail-trimmer.
4,pretty good,Only had this a few weeks but so far it works fairly well. Seems like good value for the money. Can be a little hard to use in certain areas but overall it works well. Don't know how long it will hold up since its plastic.
2,Less than I expected,"I really wanted to like this product. I have had two Norelco trimmers and both had battery failure after about a year. Hoping to find a quality item that would last, I opted for the Panasonic.My research found that this offered superior trimming. I have found that the trim is not all that even - certainly no better than the Norelcos. Maintenance as well is somewhat difficult. You are supposed to oil the blades after each use - a slightly messy, inconvenient process. I'm used to using a trimmer and being done with it. And unless I'm doing something wrong, the oil spread through the blades, making cleanup even harder. I wouldn't say this is terrible but given the chance to do it over I would buy something else."
2,coold design but poor quality,"This trimmer looked awesome when i first got it, but from the first glance, it looked it was made from cheap plastic, the attachment comb was absolutely fragile. i was really careful when using it, i knew it would break, which happened after 20 use or something, the attachment comb broke in 2 pieces, however, before it breaks it was trimming very nicely, very sharp, i would have loved a bit more power , but it is good overall ."
1,guard snapped on one side,"I do like this product as it held a charge for very very long time and performed flawlessly, until the guard broke. Mine took awhile, but it broke in a weird spot. I tried to glue it but even that wouldn't hold it's weak guard design. Disappointed because I don't want to buy a replacement for the simple reason that I think it might happen again."
3,"Great trimmer -- horrible, included battery.","Panasonic is my absolute favorite company of all time. They make so many unique and really well thought-out products, such as wet/dry shavers, TVs, really durable computers. You name it, they have it.This trimmer is no exception and the only thing I don't care for about this trimmer is the battery that is included with it. It definitely does not stand up to the test of time and requires a complete and somewhat difficult replacement to keep enjoying it again.But the price can't be beat. If you look in stores, you can't find this specific model any longer. I like the fact that you can clean it under running water and let it dry. Charge time is not bad, especially for a quick 5 minute or less trim. So a great job.My first Panasonic Shavers were made in Japan and you can see a DRAMATIC difference in the quality from that shaver to this current model.All in all, Panasonic does a great job of making high quality products that are indeed 'Ideas for life'."
3,so far so good,"I had one of these previously and it broke eventually from pulling the top off so many times, but I had it for quite a while before it finally broke (maybe a year or two of constant use). I bought a different one after this one broke (one of the types that comes with a handful of standard length head attachments) and I soon found I missed not only the ability to dial up many more lengths with the Panasonic, but also the fact that it's rechargeable (I hated the fact that the one I tried was not rechargeable and the cord would constantly be batting things off the sink while I was using it. Also the standard length heads weren't always the length I wanted for either my beard or my head). So I bought another Panasonic. If it lasts a year or two then I'll be happy enough."
2,Guard breaks easily,"This trimmer works great until the plastic guard breaks, then it's useliss. I even tryed gluing it, but it did not work."
2,"Good trimmer, but broke far too soon",Trimmer works great but the plastic guard needs to be re-engineered. See from my and others' experience that the design is too fragile. Lasted 6 mos.
3,Beware of removing guard it breaks,"This is good, good price. Works well. Oil it often. Only huge issue is removing the guard to use the shaper. Doesn't come off easy and it breaks making it useless for trimming. Replacements are expensive due to shipping"
2,I don't recommend it,It could be a good product but there is a real problem with the hair comb which breaks on the two sides. And it's impossible to find a replacement comb.
2,Great product but flimsy quallity,I think Panasonic has the best hair products but this one is too plastic and broke after just a couple of months use.
1,It's going back,"Right out of the box, this product felt flimsy and seemed poorly designed. Though it may not look like it in the product pictures, the comb attachment on the top of the clipper is detachable, and it has to be because the built-in trimmer is *underneath* the comb attachment. However, it is an absolute pain to get the comb attachment off, and everytime I tried to do it, I feared that I would damage the plastic because of the huge amount of resistance. The instruction manual, which is the typical horrible series of comic strips on a piece of paper folded over 47 times, depicts no other way to get the attachment off than to just yank it off. This clipper seemed like a great idea in concept, but that concept wasn't well executed, in my opinion. It's going back."
1,Poor Battery Life,"I've owned this for a year now, and the battery life is significantly lower than when new. I would estimate that it is 50% of what it was new. I've had electric razors in the past, and they don't lose so much power. I literally struggle to trim my sideburns with it before the battery gives out. One other thing I've noticed - the gray length adjustment guides are designed to act as a cage which traps your hair inside rather than letting it fall freely out as you trim. The result is that the blades spend more time re-trimming hair that you've already cut, and less time cutting the hair you want to get rid of. Save your money and find something else."
3,Great until the comb broke,"I've had this trimmer for just two weeks shy of a year now. I use it to cut my hair about once every two weeks. This morning, while using it, the plastic at the base of the comb broke, rendering the trimmer useless for anything involving the comb now. I loved this trimmer. It was quiet, powerful, the battery lasted for ages. But if comb breaks, as mine just did, then it's not very useful, is it? I've never dropped it, banged it or stressed it in any way. It just snapped from fatigue, I suppose. Disappointing to say the least."
2,Good but breaks easy,"I liked this trimmer for the most part. However, the plastic guard cracked really easily and broke in half in less than a year of use."
3,Broken Guide,Just like another reviewer on this site my trimmer guide has broken in the exact same poistion. How do I get a replacement???
2,Worked great before the comb broke,"I bought almost the exact same trimmer several years ago and got a good year or so of use out of it, then the comb broke. I bought a complete replacement and the comb broke after just a couple months. I will say that it does work pretty darn well when it's not broken, though. I guess you should try to avoid taking the comb off if you can.I just ordered a replacement comb. Hopefully it's the right one."
4,"The plastic attachment broke, but I don't need it.","As many of the 1 star reviews said, the plastic attachment breaks easily. I don't use it. I shave without it (shortest possible). The battery charges quickly and lasts forever. I had mine for over 3 years. However, if you want to trim your beard, not just shave it off.. you may want a different machine."
4,Replacement part available from Panasonic,"This is a nice hair clipper, but the comb attachment will break for sure. I have purchased 2 of these units in the past 18 months and in both occasions the comb attachments have broken. The last one only lasted 6 months...Update--07/13/11I called Panasonic and they do offer a replacement comb attachment. Call Panasonic at 1800-833-9626--Part # WER224S7398. Price $1.45..plus shipping of $5.95..You can order up to 5 with the same SHP/HANDL fee of $5.95..."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"While this razor does a good job trimming a beard, it is VERY flimsly constructed.The trimming guard (comb) broke after about 10 uses. I fixed it (glued it back together) and it broke again (in a different place.) after 2 uses.Panasonic does offer replacement combs but the shipping cost is more than the cost of the part. (And, as of today, the part is backordered.)Do you self a favor, spend your money on a different razor. If you buy a ER 224, you will soon be buying a new razon anyways."
1,trimmer plastic guide broke and now wobbles when used.,"This is a disappointment because the plastic comb device broke in the first week of use. It is hard to remove to get to the small trimmer underneath the guide. When it came off, the end piece of plastic snapped. I suppose I could have super glued it, but I felt that it would be better to call Panasonic to replace it. They refused to replace it as a defective piece. They said I would have to pay for it. I said that I would rather send it back to Amazon.com and that I would write a bad review about their product if they didn't send another plastic part. They refused to stand behind their product, so I am telling everyone now that this is a piece of garbage and if Panasonic customer service is this bad, I will never buy another of their product of any kind again. The designer of this product has the IQ of plankton.Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)"
1,BUYER BEWARE - design flaw in plastic clipper guard,"Used for 1.5 months, and the plastic clipper guard broke! This renders the clippers basically useless. From reading other reviews, it turns out that this is a common problem. I called Panasonic, and they stated that this is NOT covered by their product warranty (?!?!). They recommended I buy a replacement. BUYER BEWARE"
2,so so,thought it would be great because the attachments would never get lost but it fell and the hair length ajustment piece broke. also its a pain having to charge it and losing the cord all the time. battery life is low and its not powerful at all. if you shave your head all the time i would get a set of pro clippers for more money. its worth it . they cut faster and cleaner like the barber shop.
1,not for hair cut at all,"I ended up with screwing my head badly and had to go to hairdresser.The comb is too soft and you will cut uneven, plus cutting performance is very poor. Returned it."
2,Good in a pinch,"Whatever....you get what you pay for. Found it under a corded/cordless search which was misleading cuz the 'base' you charge it on is a transformer brick which means that when plugged in, the thing takes up not only the above outlet on a dual plug stacked outlet, but you will need about 3 more inches of clearance on top of that! Bad/stupid design to match my bad/stupid assumption that it must be a great/bargain purchase since it has 'Panasonic' stamped on it. Yes, still old enough to be ignorant of the demise of name-branding trust. oh, and it works like a piece of garbage as well if you want to use the 'adjustable crown attachment'."
2,sub-par for my use!,"may be an outstanding beard trimmer, but I wanted an outstanding goat trimmer. It is not that!"
1,good use but bad quilety,"it was working well for first charge, then when i recharge it for the second time it didnt work any more. i went to the pansonic agent and they told sorry there is no map for this item to fix it."
1,junk,"doen't trim well.hair stuck, cutter is not sharp enough.battery is horrible, last 3 min w/full charge.cann't believe it's panasonic brand."
1,It is NOT hair clipper.,I BOUGHT IT FROM BEST BUY AND RETURNED NEXT DAY. IT DOES NOT CUT HAIR. IT IS NOT HAIR CLIPPER.
5,Absolutely the Best,"Wife talked me into growing a beard. I thought that meant less prep time in the morning - so I agreed. Not True! Having a decent looking beard takes a bit more attention than shaving. This trimmer is PERFECT. It is as close to ""fool proof"" as I can imagine. Mistakes are virtually impossible. It did take me some time to trust using it in the shower without a mirror, but it worked flawlessly. For anyone new to growing a beard, I highly recommend this trimmer."
3,Did not get as much life out of it as I thought,"I liked this trimmer for the year or so that I used it. The adjustable settings used with the guard allowed me to clipper my arm and leg hair to a comfortable level while removing the guard let me get up close on my head and face. I expected the unit to last longer than 1 year in terms of battery life cycle as it will now no longer take a charge. Being a sealed unit, I am not going to attempt to replace the batteries (probably ni-cad AA equivalents.) I hope to have better luck with a different brand and battery technology (lithium ion.)"
3,Poor plastic design attachment,I use this machine for haircuts only. It gives a great cut but the plastic attachment is not very easily disconnected to remove hairs that get caught underneath it. After about a 10 uses the plastic attachment fell and broke. I've been cutting my hair for over 15 years and I've dropped the plastic attachments numerous times before and never had an issue until now. I am still willing to give Panasonic another shot since I have been using their various trimmers for a very long time and have had much better luck in the past.
2,Started off well....finish? Not so much,"I purchased this beard trimmer ~ 2 years ago.It did a decent job of trimming my beard, though I wish it it's lower (closer shave) settings were a little finer.unfortunately though the Li-ion battery's longevity left a lot to be desired. obviously any Li-ion battery is going to be limited to a certain number of charge/discharge cycles (and capacity will degrade over time), but it just seemed like this puppy's life was inordinately bad....within 6 months I noticed a difference. I'd much rather pay 20% more for a quality battery, yes?Worse than that though, now the unit won't function even when it's plugged in. Really disappointing..."
3,Less than expected,"This shaver looks very nice, but it does not perform as well as it looks. On average my beard stays about a 1/4"" thick not a whole lot there but this shaver still has a tuff time for me and pulls alot of hair. I also have an issue when I get to my mustache as I cannot get just under my nose because the tip of the adjuster sticks out a little to far. I also am losing power after only 2 full face shaves. I kind of wish the adjuster was easier to remove for cleaning and that it came with a bag to keep it in."
5,Beyond Expectations,"Not only is the TABASCO product better than expected, but the service from the supplier is outstanding. The product was shipped and delivered as promised and the quality met the expected standard. If you are looking for spicy brown mustard, purchase TABASCO brand and purchase it from from Crescent Provisions!"
2,It's OK...there are better resources,"I ordered this book with great expectations but found it disappointing. I think it's hard to publish a book like this because it would need constant updating. I thought someof the ""great"" deals were outdated and the ""great"" adventures not as great as hyped. You can find better, more current information just by doing some searches on the web. This book might be a good intro for beginner dog owners who don't have a clue as to what kind of activities are possible but the knowledgeable dog owner who is really into their dogs would already know all the stuff in this book. Save your money and get another book."
3,"Good, but not great imo","I was introduced to Orchestra Baobab with the Specialist In All Styles (released 2002) and was blown away. It was tight, punchy and full of warm grooves. Nearly every song on it amazed me. After hearing that one, I kept hearing that Pirates Choice was the holy grail for this band. I bought it, listened thoughtfully to it and don't get it. Is it good? Absolutely. Is it great? Not to me, but that's me. It's a laid back recording session so it lacks the tightness and snap of Specialist. If you too were intro'ed to OB by Specialist, be prepared for a much different sound on this one."
4,infectious groove,Good stuff. Warning--You might get the urge to quit you job and wander West Africa.
5,wlangan,"I love this music. I was on a Caribbean island and tried listening to classic rock and modern rock and country music but nothing hit the spot like this double CD. To the average North American ear this music may seem to meander or to have too lackadaisical a sound but that is only because the virtuoso performances with regard to horns and guitar and vocals are completely pure and free from pretension. Like an athlete that makes a difficult play look easy because of an advanced skill level, this band has this wonderful sound that must have required a lot of hard work but that comes across effortlessly comforting and soothing. This CD, I can say from experience, can bring a tropical spirit to even downtown DC rush hour traffic. It is also so subtly complex that it always contains something interesting to focus on even if you listen to it over and over. Like a tropical sunset on the ocean it has beauty and warmth and yet great depth simultaneously."
2,Disappointed,I love some of Orchetra Baobab later work. The sound quality on this is a little muted and lacks the great fidelity one expects of more contemporary recordings. Also this music is a little less impassioned than other work I have by them.
1,Box of Mildew,"I bought this product as a gift and was really embarrassed that when opened, it was found to have mildew inside the boards that you put the shapes on. This mildew also fused the two boards together such that when separated, the black board's finish became damaged. I wrote to Amazon Customer Service who informed me that another one was on the way and that I could send mine back when I received the new one.... however it was due to me more than a week ago, and never arrived. Bad marks all around on this purchase !"
5,Oh! those incomparable 70's!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Colorforms......COLORFORMS!!!! What better way to escapethe rainy days,Mom's hamburger(instead of McDonald's)the 5ft.10 9yr old named Buddy Ruppatkin who punch you inthe arm and take your bike,all the times you have towear clothes your family had bought you and you couldnot stand,eating healthy cereal,going to the automotivestore with your Pop,chicken pox,egg salad sandwiches,lemoncandy,Lawrence Welk 5:30pm NBC SUNDAY,CHURCH(remember I am 6now..GOD understands)homework,and last but not leasthaving to count to a 100 before it's your turn on theswing!....Colorforms.....COLORFORMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I will always love my colorforms."
2,A little disappointing,"I was disappointed because I expected this set to have shapes like people, houses, trees, flowers, etc. to make pictures, not just triangles, squares and circles."
4,Limitless creative value,"I was there when the first edition was released. It was magical then and when I opened the very attractive box of my new version, it was magic all over again. No guidelines, two background boards, bright basic primary colored shapes; it's tantamount to having a nice building block set in your lap. Use on mirrors, windows, and other smooth glass-like surfaces to unleash new energies. It would be even more fun to have extra colorform pages from which to cut one's own shapes. I rate my Colorforms with an A+."
1,A huge disappointment!,"I bought these as a gift for my granddaughter and they had to be returned twice, both times because they were moldy. Perhaps a new factory is needed to produce this product."
2,They don't stick to the board!,"Just purchased and received this for my 2.5 year old grand daughter. Sadly, our Colorforms do not stick well to the two included boards at all. The Colorforms fall right off of the boards. I saw other reviewers mention this as well and should have read the reviews first. I would be so greatfull if someone would be able to tell me what number to call to ask the manufacturer for another set of boards. I sent an email but received no response."
5,Children's Enjoyment,Bought this as a gift for grandson. It's educational and yet enjoyable. My children enjoyed this and I know my grandson will.
2,Colorforms,These did not stay on board. Kids played with them once and it became a big mess. Lots of small pieces.
3,Disappointed; changed to Tangrams instead,"I enjoyed Colorforms when I was young: making extensive pictures and stories with shapes was a delight. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed in each Colorforms purchase over the past 10 years. Finally, my husband introduced me to Tangrams. They are not as extensive or small as Colorforms, but at least the kids play with the Tangrams (magnetic)."
3,dorie,I found this movie a bit slow and not as good as the Nicole Kidman Australia movie. Then again the pace of life was slow in Australia 130 years ago. I will watch it again and hope to get more from the story line.
1,northernrivers,"I hate to admit it, being an Australian, but this movie is a shocker. There's only one word for it.....TERRIBLE. Mostly because, as used to happen back in the 50's when it was made......it has American actors and actresses playing the part of Australians......and failing miserably with how we speak and, more importantly, the words we speak. We don't use the term ""ranch"" in Australia. We have farms or cattle stations. I bought this dvd purely on account of Chips Rafferty, a very popular Australian actor of that era, but he had only a miniscule part. Don't waste your money on this film.....you'll fall asleep with boredom before it finishes."
2,Cute but quality could improve,"I adored this set. But after washing the set a second time, the corner of the sheet was completely ripped apart. I am afraid to wash any of it again. I read the reviews for the matching toddler set and they all agreed to poor quality. I am going to check with the company to see what they will do about it."
4,Good but what about twins or more??????,"I loved the complete set. I have purchased everything I can, but I have twin granddaugthers and one more 10 months old. So I needed an extra bumper pad, crib ruffle and sheet. But the sheet is all I can Purchase seperate. I also need a toddler bedding set for my old granddaugther not found. Please I ask for your help. I lost a child at age five my older daugther has all my grandbabies and to Granny and Pawpaw they are answered prayers for us. We lost our home to a house fire last year we will be moving into our new home, with new memories with our new grandkids please help us make this so special to them as well as us. Help us find the items needed for thier room at our house to be extra special. thank-you so very much . Please let us know if you can help.Granny And Paw PawPeggy and William Owens(251) 765-2707"
5,Value and quality all in one bedding set!,"This being my first child and a girl, I really wanted to make her nursery a little girl's dream. When I saw this bedding set online I knew this was the one. Not only do you get the complete bedding set, including the dust ruffle, but you also get the window valance and the diaper stacker!!! What a deal for the price considering that most quality bedding sets only come with the comforter and sheets for the same price as the La Petite Bebe bedding. When the set arrived I was so excited, the bedding screams quality. You can see it everywhere, not just on first visual inspection but in the design and the construction! We also ordered the wall border, which matches perfectly with the bedding sets. Sometimes the border color and bedding colors vary slightly but these colors are an exact match!! My daughter is a dream come true and so is her nursery with the addition of La Petite Bebe bedding!!! I highly recommend this bedding set!"
4,GIRLY GIRL BEDDING,"I HAD NOT BOUGHT ANY NEW BEDDING WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND CHILD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FIND OUT WHAT WE WERE HAVING. I HAD LOOKED AT A FEW DIFFERENT STYLES OF BEDDING FOR EITHER BOY OR GIRL AND WAS REALLY HOPING I WOULD HAVE A GIRL SO I COULD USE THIS AWESOME LOOKING BEDDING. IT IS REALLY ""GIRLY GIRL"" AND FEATURES PRINCESS AND BALLET AND A LOT OF PINK. AFTER HAVING MY GIRL I PURCHASED THE BEDDING WHICH IS SO CUTE AND I HAVE HAD A LOT OF COMMENTS ON.THE ONLY THING I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THE SHEETS. I ENDED UP GETTING THE SHEET THE SET COMES WITH AND 2 ADDITIONAL. WITHIN THE FIRST FEW TIMES OF USING THEM THEY ALL HAD RIPPED BECAUSE THEY DON'T FIT THE CRIB MATTERESS CORRECTLY. I WAS STILL ABLE TO USE THEM BECAUSE THE RIP WASN'T UP TO WEAR THE BABY SLEEPS - BUT AFTER SOME MORE WASHINGS AND USINGS I HAD TO THROW THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE REALLY BAD."
3,Very Pretty but a couple of flaws...,"This set is very pretty and the price is reasonable compared to others. It's a very girly-girl set and the colors work well together. I only really have two negatives: first, the sheet is paper-thin and rips easily b/c it doesn't fit over our standard size mattress. Secondly, the bumper only has ties on the top and not the bottom which I think would be much better. Other sets out there have on top AND bottom. I think it's safer.The quilt is very plush and can be used on the floor during tummy-time. However, one side is very decorative and I worry about a child being able to pull the ribbon or tulle off and possibly choking. I only put my baby on the plain, striped side of the quilt."
5,"Beautiful, high quality, and worth it!","I LOVE this set! It is very high quality. Everything is durable, and it is definitely a good buy. It is a cut above the other, less expensive sets, and just as nice as other sets that are much more expensive. We get lots of compliments on our daughter's room. She also really loves the mobile. I love the lamp because I can turn on just the nightlight part of it to go in and check on her. We painted our daughter's room pink and sage green, and it looks great with this bedding."
4,Great set!!!!!,"If you're having a girl, you can't help but love this set! It's not over the top, so your friends won't think you've lost your mind, but it's girly enough to be fit for your little princess. We just love it! The only reason I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is because the quilt does not fit in the crib at all. Not that it should mind you, because babies shouldn't have it in while they are sleeping, but it doesn't even come close to fitting while the baby is out. It's not long enough to fit all the way across. We have a standard size crib, so I'm surprised that they didn't think this through. Everything else fits: the dust ruffle, sheets, bumper etc so I'm confused as to why this doesn't, especially since the quilt is a lot of the money you are paying for this set. Oh well, just get it anyway!"
4,More hose than I bargained for,This hose may hit your hood blanket as its a tad taller than the factory hose I pulled off. A quick minute with the hose cutter and its fitting good.
5,Excellent on-line shopping experience,"Purchased product at a great price, it was shipped VERY quickly, and it arrived in perfect condition. I will continue to buy through Amazon.com with great confidence. Thank you."
4,My favorite episode/episodes in this season but WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS?,"As I have stated in reviews for the previous 5 seasons. I got into this show early this decade in reruns.Enjoyable. Not the best show ever made. Errors, plot lines from other programs & they repeated some. Actors in different episodes playing different parts.This is, however, my favorite of the 8 seasons. Why? As a Disney fan, the 2 part The House Meets The Mouse I always enjoy watching to see Disney World & the attractions.However, we have the SAME PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN ON OTHER DVD PACKAGES FOR THE PREVIOUS SEASONS. WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS? Again, no cast commentary. WHY CAN'T WE HEAR FROM STARS OF THE SHOW ABOUT IT, THEIR MEMORIES? ANYTHING?And, a tacky for Warner Brothers. Putting an advertisement brochure instead THAT IS OUT OF DATE. Example, it said seasons 1 to 4 of Full House are available but season 5 would be (AND WAS) released in December 2006. TACKY, TACKY & OUTDATED."
4,Very good season,"Come Fly with Me- 8/10The Long Goodbye- 6/10Road to Tokyo- 6/10Radio Days- 4/10Lovers and Other Tanners- 8/10Educating Jesse- 7/10Trouble in Twin Town- 7/10The Play's the thing- 4/10Nice Guy's Finish First- 6/10I'm Not D.J.- 6/10Designing Mothers- 8/10A Very Tanner Christmas- 7/10The Dating Game- 5/10Birthday Blues- 7/10Be True to Your Pre-School- 8/10The Heartbreak Kid- ?Silence is Not Golden- 9/10Please Don't Touch the Dinosaur- 7/10Subterranean Graduation Blues- 6/10Grand Gift Auto- 2/10Room for One More- 7/10Prom Night- 6/10The House Meets the Mouse, part 1- 4/10The House Meets the Mouse, part 2- 7/10"
3,Okay,"The book is good for any of those that want to learn how to play slide guitar. It teaches you the basics. The CD is very hard to follow and keep up with, and I really feel it was done poorly. If you need a starting point, this will head you in the right direction."
5,Why I wanted the Disney VHS format.,"I ordered this Disney feature on vhs, is because I have Westward on DvD through the Disney Movie Club and its the most disappointing this I've ever encountered because on DVD,there's 30 minutes of the beginning of this film choped off,and the vhs originally has 94min of running time. My biggest disappointment with the both of these formats is, They're not in the WIDESCREEN format as they originally should've been."
1,Weak Link in X10 Family,"I've been using the X10 modules for several years now, but decided to introduce my computer into the process. I have to admit, this is the first X10 product I've been disappointed with.1) The interface is a SERIAL CONNECTION...amazing in this day and age, when newer computers don't even have serial ports. This was apparently designed in the dark ages (5-10 years ago). For $50 more, X10 offers a USB version.2) The included software reminds me of Windows 95, both look/feel and reliability. I'm told the ActiveHome Pro Software ($49.99) is far better, but haven't been able to find it anywhere to check out. Nor have I been able to find out if the software works with this module.The Active Home Pro kits for $49 basic and $99 with control modules and software are MUCH better deals. Unfortunately, while Amazon has many of the Pro Modules, switches, etc, they don't seem to have either of the Pro Computer interfaces."
1,Junk,"I've had two of them fail, after the crappy one year warranty was up. I woulnd't buy anything else from X10. It's only a marketing company - witness their bling-bling web site with everything ON SALE every day. Gimme a break. They don't give a damn about customers."
3,loudness,i have recently installed these mufflers on my 1971 chevelle ss 502 big block and you can barley even hear the exhaust. i ran true dual 2.5 so if you are going to use these mufflers get 3.00
4,Witty satire of politics and culture,"First, the amazon.com review of this book contains two errors. The American spin doctors were hired by Hannibal's opponent, not by Hannibal. And, although Hannibal certainly likes his Brown Death and ""strong coffee,"" I would hardly call him a ""hopeless drunk.""Although I was less interested in Eggert's past affairs than the author seemed to be, I really enjoyed this book. Set in the fictitious island nation of Freeland, it is in many ways a good metaphor for politics in small U.S. states and cities and for the sad struggle against the popular uniculture many small traditional cultures face. The book is anything but sad, however. Lots of wit and humor. Rut (Freelandic for Ruth) is one of the more appealing female characters I've read. Some nice nods to Icelandic Nobel laureate Haldor Laxness (author of my favorite novel of all time, Independent People, for which Leithauser wrote an intro to the new English-language printing).Highly recommended."
2,Everything you never wanted to know about Iceland.,"This is a long, long book about a little imaginary country (a sort of like Iceland on acid). Since Leithauser is a good poet (read ""Hundreds of Fireflies""), with an admirable talent for compression, you have to wonder why he would blather on about so little. Actually his other novels (""Equal Distance,"" ""Hence"") weren't long on plot; but the eye was sharp, the writing, well, poetic. ""Freeland"" just doesn't have music, or life, or lift. Did an editor at Knopf see the MS"
1,Have you ever watched an iceberg thaw (in cold weather)?,"I have to confess that, even though I used to be a fan of the author's writing, I couldn't finish this book, probably because I kept waiting for something to happen, or for there to be a payoff. Is Leithauser getting paid by the word these daze? If possible, ""Friends"" is less interesting than Ishiguro's ""The Unconsoled,"" which is saying something. I think the problem lies in a tremendous straining to be entirely original and ""creative"" in a nouveau belletristic way. Sorry, Brad"
1,Just never got to anything useful!,"This book sounded like a good one...I loved the title and hoped for more than I found inside. The author keeps teasing, ""If you went through the death of your parent, read on for practical help!"" Chapter after chapter is filled with this entreaty. It gets annoying to read this plea in every chapter! Finally, the very last chapter in the book consists of 10 suggestions for moving on from the death of a parent. They are very simplistic and not worth reading the entire book to get.I lost my mother when I was 10, and it is something I will never truly recover from. It has shaped my life from that time forward, and made me who I am. I read a lot of books about people who lose a parent in their childhood, just to see what other people have gone through. My dad was not a very interactive parent either, so I consider myself an orphan in some ways. I think there are better books about healing from the loss of a parent."
2,There are better books out there,"I was so hopeful when I picked up this book. As an adult who lost a parent during my childhood and as a professional who has worked with grieving children for more than 25 years, I was looking forward to reading this book with the hope that it would be an invaluable resource. Unfortunately, although easy to read, I was disappointed. There are better books out there. I recommend anything by Alan Wolfelt or Never Too Young To Know by Phyllis Silverman. If a child has a serious or terminally ill parent, I highly recommend Wendy Harpham's books. If you are an adult who lost a parent during your childhood, take a look at The Loss That Is Forever by Maxine Harris or Hope Edelman's classic, Motherless Daughters."
2,Not what I expected...,"I purchased this book when I lost my mother. While I am sure the book is of value, it is geared toward those who have lost their parents as CHILDREN, not as adults. I didn't find it applicable to what I was looking for."
4,"Sexy heist comedy with Reynolds, Down, Niven","A good chance to see Burt Reynolds in non-""Smokey and the Bandit"" mode. Reynolds is Jack Rhodes, a debonair American jewel thief who's pursued by dogged Scotland Yard investigator Willis (David Niven) while pursuing gorgeous kleptomaniac Gillian (Lesley-Anne Down) and a fortune in jewels, which all ends up in a complicated operation to glom the valuables in Amsterdam. Exceptionally diverting!"
2,too boring,this movie is set in england and its the wrong scipt for reynolds not interesting at all reynolds tries to get a girl whos a burler
5,Good,It is a very good book on the tribe of Ephraim and the tribes role in biblical times up to today as the nation of Great Britian and her colonies.
3,All too brief.,"""Tell Me Baby"" is the second single from the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""Stadium Arcadium"". Like all recent Chili Peppers singles, Warner Bros. released it as a two part deal, splitting three b-sides over two short discs.The single itself is clearly a Chili Peppers classic-- a funky groove is laid down throughout with guitar and voice creating dense, nervous, verses and open, breezy choruses.The b-side on this part is the brief (about two and a half minutes) ""A Certain Someone"". Sitting on a delicate, Fender Rhodes driven melody, it's a decent enough piece, slowly loping along, with vocalist Anthony Kiedis singing almost awkwardly above it all.No doubt any fan of the band is going to want this one-- I'm rating it three stars because of its brevity (it's a hard to find good value in two and a half minutes of non-album tracks), but the b-side here is probably worth the investment. Recommended for fans of the band."
2,Too much superpowerful magic,"The Sullanciri can now teleport, cast spells to shapechange other people, mindcontrol dozens of people at a distance, hear a whisper from half a mile away, and casually break into enemy castles to kill people. There is way too much magic on the human side also.Excerpt 1The Apprentice gave him a witheringly depreciative glance. ""You dulls. This will take forever."" She gestured once and a blue spark flew from her right hand. It hit the broom dead in the middle of the stick and wrenched it from his grasp. Whirling and twirling, the broom danced through the flour and drove it in a wave to the waiting sack.Excerpt 2Thaumaturgical enery surged from him in an invisible wave that swept out toward its target. It swelled and gathered the ship up into its grasp. He raised his right hand and the ship emerged from the sea. Twenty feet, forty, higher and higher."
1,Awful.,"Alright ,if you want a book about sex and violence,go ahead .If not ,go for someone else.In the beginning basically all that happened was action.They solve every problem involving the enemy with action.Also ,as soon as Wil meets a woman,he falls in love with her .Unrealistic ,isn't it?I looked ahead a bit ,still fight fight fight.Even Eddings awful Belgariad is better than this .If you want really good stuff ,try Terry Brooks ,Robert Jordan,or maybe Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman.Don't waste your reading on this."
3,Not great,"I'm a huge fan of Stackpole's. Once a hero is a fantastic book and his Star Wars books have all been great. This book is not not bad, it is just not exciting at all. I never got into the characters that much even though some of them could have been very interesting. Stackpole's writing made it easy for me to finish the book but the I won't be reading the other books in the series."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"I went into this book with the highest of expectations. i really enjoyed the Dark Glory War a lot and couldn't wait to see what happened. i'll tell you what happened...not a lot....lots of traveling back and forth from place to place without much action in between. Although the ending picked up a bit, i really missed the action and adventure and excitement from the first book. Although I'll definitely read the next book (i already own it) it'll probably be awhile. overall I thought this book was about 300 pages too long...there was no need for this book to have been 700 pages long. I loved the swords and socerery and fighting and action of the first book soo much, i can't say enough how disappointed i was in this book. I hope the action and excitement picks up in the next volume. By the way could the character of Kerrigan be any more boring???? Sorry Michael but I expected more..."
3,"Nice enough, little depth","I really enjoyed this album when I first got it. And there are still some songs on here that get me every time. But most of the tracks faded with time, as the songwriting and production didn't give me enough to keep coming back. If you can pick it up used for 5 bucks or less, then I would get it. As the other reviewers mentioned, it's pretty, very poppy, very emo."
2,Overpriced and not very flavorful,More like a cross between white and natural sugar - disappointing and too high a price to pay for that kind of disappointment. I will seek another brand.
3,he must have millions of kids,"The majority of the book is about sex. That makes it a fun read, but i doubt if klaus made all them conquests. One minute he's eyeing some chick at a railway station, the next thing you know they're makin whoopee. It's quite a fun book to read, even if klaus is the biggest egomaniac. Just read the last page of nonsense 'i came into this world in human form,but the suns stars deserts..mountains,skies,oceans were trapped inside me..' 'i am the gentle puff of air that caresses you eyes'. He could also have written 'i am a sex maniac and bs artist of the first order'He claims an incestuous relationship with his sister. He takes part in the universe. He's a force of nature. He's the greatest actor...too great for herzog.He must have been a monumental pain...!it's a good read anyway,but you'll want to hit the guy"
3,It's not the style change...,"It's the lack of individualy appealing songs on this album that bothers me. I don't mind the inclusion of the 'Death' growl, or the reduction in the 'black' screech so prevalent on the previous two releases, but the songs, by themselves, just aren't very listenable. I've run the disc through several times but nothing seems to stand out, and there aren't really too many layers in the music to sift through, so what you hear the first time is pretty much what it is entirely. It's certainly not a 'bad' album, but rather overly simplistic, with a minimalist feel in it's melodic structure and songwriting. I believe this to be intentional by Hecate because the eleven tracks only account for a thirty-three minute long recording. An album that on the surface bares a 'pop' minded template but comes across as an 'ambient death/black metal' experience. It's a different Hecate Enthroned that released KOC, but still worth checking out."
1,A transition from good Black metal to mediocre Death metal.,"This band had a very good start and all three albums released before ""Kings of Chaos"" were absolutely marvellous. No comparison to COF can be done here. Styles may be similar, but Hecate Enthroned are totally different from COF. ""King Of Chaos"" is impossible to hear and is a huge disappointment. They performed a transition from very good Black metal to some more than bleak Death metal and they had done that badly. Waisted [more money] on a CD which I had to throw away when I was cleaning my apartment this weekend. One star goes for the fast Amazon.com service."
5,Not for smaller children,for people who love pokemon and love monopaly will love this game. It gives a new twist on monopaly.
3,It's another monoply!!,"This game is ok. I mean if you like collecting the different monoploy than you will love this game. But if you are just like me, it's just another monopoly! The only thing different is the characters, the board spaces, and the cards. If you like monopoly, just get the original."
1,The Pewter Pokemon Mixup - HATE IT,"The pokemon monopoly figures pictured on ToysRUS.com were not the same as what was shipped to us. They were pictured to be made of rubber and in color, and what we received were figures made of pewter. My daughter was very disappointed because she collects the colored half inch kind that are pictured in the pokemon monopoly on your website. You should really make sure that what is pictured is exactly what is shipped out!"
5,You'll love it!!,"I use this equalizer for transcribing cassette tapes and digital uploads in my home business. It works like a charm at eliminating most background noises, adjusting bass voices for better audibility, and provides up to 75% volume increase for soft voices. Would be great for secretaries whose bosses dictate on airplanes or in the car, too. It also works well for MP3 players and all kinds of stereo systems. Simply plug your headphone into the equalizer, and the equalizer into the headphone outlet of your stereo or dictation equipment. Great little gadget!!!"
1,Agreed: horrible product DO NOT BUY!!,"Unfortunately, I disregarded the pervious reviewer and purchased this product anyway. It is very noisy (heavy hissing)--totally unacceptable. I'm highly disappointed in Koss."
4,"Good Product, Good Price","I use the Koss with my mp3 player and a small 2.1 speaker system at my desk at work and it's well worth the $20 price tag. The EQ does a great job of adding extra kick to the sound and the settings are quite responsive. There is a slight hum, but this can be eliminated by turning up the volume on your player and turning down the volume on the Koss EQ. I only have a couple of complaints. As said in another review, since it's designed to be used with portable players it really needs a belt clip. Also, there is no option to hook the Koss up to a wall adapter, so I must recommend using rechargeable batteries. The 20 hours that Koss says you get from a set of batteries, though, is lowballing it. I've gotten over twice that much time from one set of rechargeable AAAs before I had to recharge them. This may be due to the fact that I keep the volume on the EQ low in order to eliminate the hum. To make a long review short, you can't go wrong with this product."
2,Weak quality; not as good as the previous version,"I have the the older Koss EQ30 portable equalizer to help clean up the sound of my TV when run via headphones. It's pretty good, but over time has gotten some loose wires, and occasionally crackles. I would love a replacement but, sadly, that item is no longer available.The new version, the EQ50, is a poor substitute. It relies too much on the strength of the source signal, and does not do a very good job. It works OK on some equipment, but still not as good as the earlier version. Plus, the EQ30 was more compact and easier to clip onto a short pocket. Why in the world Koss decided to discontinue a better product is baffling.Probably best to keep looking."
2,Hiss is more than slight,"Granted the product is very cheap, but I decided to try it out. It is pretty noisy, about like a old cassette tape with no dolby. If you listen to rock and pop, you probably won't notice it that much. The 3 eq bands do what they should and help warm up the the smaller ear buds and phones."
1,Koss EQ,I am not sure how anyone can give this product more than 1 star. It is absolutely horrible. Extremely noisy. You hear hiss noise more than music you play. Worse thing is that the noise does not get less when you turn the volume down (and turn mp3 up instead) as someone said above. It also grabs all sorts of noise and interferances around including your hand when you grab it. It is bigger than many mp3 players with no clip on it. The equalizer part works however in general it is useless due to the noise. This product should be definetly taken out from the market.
1,"This is a bad product, waste your money on something else.","Total garbage. No only this thing is huge, bigger than most mp3 players and it doesn't have a belt clip or anything, it sounds awful, absolutely horrible. The hiss others complained about is very loud, it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping, buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises. Besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible, low dynamics and distorts easily. This is a bad product that should be taken off the market. It's not even worth the price here. Heck, even $1.99 would be a waste of money. Avoid!"
4,"Great product, bulkier than it could be","Great product with good sound (coming from a profession sound engineer of 10 years) and the volume control proves useful as well. It's light weight and very thin, but still somewhat larger than it could be, I suppose that's because of the batteries. I'd still buy it again though."
1,Purchased at Amazon,"Seller shipped the KOSS EQ50 3-band stereo Equalizer promptly.I inserted this unit between a RODE stereo Videomic microphone and the line input of my ZOOM H2 portable sound recorder.(to boost the mike signal by only bout 3 db).A strong hiss - nearly as strong as the signal! - makes the Koss completely unusable for this purpose.Some hiss with a high gain is normal, but not with only 3 db of gain.Amazon authorized the return promptly and without hassle."
5,A HEADPHONES' BEST FRIEND!,"As we all know, most portable electronic devices come equipped with substandard-sounding headphones. This little gadget greatly enhances the sound quality in a cheap set of headphones, so you can imagine what it can do for a good set. I've been using this EQ for over three years now and frankly, I can't listen to music without it. For the price, you just can't beat it! Yes, it has a slight hiss but once the music starts, it seems to disappear entirely. It's etremely light weight and it's built to last. I bought another one just in case my first one would break but it's still going strong! If you're a headphone buff like me and have a discerning taste for quality sound, this little EQ will satisfy you immensely! Highly recommended!"
1,Junk,"This thing kinda stinks. It's noisy, there is a hiss. I wanted to like it... But it's really not that good. I recently just threw it away..."
5,Wookie Catamaran Review,"This was an excellent toy. I am a 13 year old from Chatham Mass. And I love Star Wars. This particular set was awesome. The mini-figs are so cool, especially the clones. Yoda's pretty cool. It cost 10 dollars more than that ARC 170 starfighter I bought but its worth every penny. I started collecting about the time when the Episode 3 toys came out. I dont really like the random legos that arent based on something. I have all but 3 of the lego Episode 3 sets. I must admit that this set was the best. It has plenty of minifigs and cool featuers like the rocket, and the neon bombs.Its worth every penny."
3,Not what I expected.,"Nice book, but was not what I was looking for. Returned it and ordered another book from the same author, and was very pleased."
5,Great collection,Songs 4 Worship: Great Is the LordThis is a wonderful collection of worship music. It will fill your heart with joy when you listen to it. The Maranatha Singers and many others are on this disc.
5,great,thank you cause i still could use this cd that i brought that was used still in good shape n sound great..
1,not worth it,"I'm usually pretty good at making lemonade out of lemons. But there is nothing here that is any good. Make your own, PLEASE. Don't waste your money. I made one out of clear vinyl tubing from Ace hardware (about 3ftlong). Make sure it will fit your bleeder screw thingy. A empty pickle jar with a lid, poke a hole in the lid with a screw driver, run the tube down to the bottom and punch an air hole in the lid also. Connect the tube to the bleeder screw and for me what worked well was to set the jar up on two milk crates so when you pump the brakes the fluid has to work its way up the tube this way there is always fluid near the bleeder screw. I saw so many tiny air bubbles come out of my system.I love the way my brakes feel now. Fresh fluid and no air in the system. Nice and tight not spongy. Always keep your reservoir full."
4,Never once failed me over the years,I've owned several of these over the years and never had a major issue with one. A little bit of force always gets the plastic needle seated in the bleeder until its time to pull it out and switch wheels. Remember to empty the bottle into a bigger bottle when you move to the next wheel and you shouldn't have an issue with leaks or spills. I've never had a problem finding a place for the magnet to stick but have heard of people using part of a clothes hanger to hang it in place while pumping the brakes.
4,Works as expected,Bought this from Autozone. Worked perfectly on my old T-bird. Only compaint is the magnet is not very strong as several others have said. I just used the magnet to hang the bottle on my springs. Supplied nozzels fit my bleeder screws fine without much mess at all. Made bleeding my brakes by myself an easy job.
2,Bleed-o-matic Not user friendly,Tried to use this on my brake bleed job over the holidays. The tubing are not flexible and hard to expand. It is better to buy a tube kit fro Autozone and cut them to length and grab an empty water bottle. I do not recommend this product...a waste of money.
2,works ok,"Only problem is magnet is almost worthless, which is the whole purpose for a one man job. Otherwise works fine."
1,Junk,Pretty much useless. The bottle it probably 2 oz capacity looks like a nail polish size rather than brake bleeder
1,useless,Magnet is too weak. Point won't stay in the bleeder hole and air leaks and fluid spills everywhere. Air leaks into bottle. This kit is worthless.
5,the best for the money,i have 1992 ford f150 2wd and just wanted little more to the truck and it set very low. This kit was easy to install and fit exactlly the was it said it would. the only thing that it doesnt say is that the fan shroud and the clutch fan will not work after the install. i had to get electric cooling fans to keep truck at normall temp at idle and to be able to run my ac. The steering adaptor does fit it may give you some trouble but if you spread it open were it goes on the gear box it will help.
3,No Boom for your Buck!,"The sound on this system isn't very good. But if you were like me and looking for something that doesn't take up the entire desk and don't need to crank the volume then these speakers are decent. But the sound value goes down the farther you turn up the volume. If you are looking for speakers to turn up and let the whole building listen, then this is not the right system for you. If you like just a mild to low sound then they are good mainly because they are cheap."
1,Not what I expected,"I didn't like the music, others may like it, but it was not my taste. It was too religious for me."
5,Hot!,"This dvd was shot on the cheap, but the quality is pretty good except for a few out of focus shots and most of the performers' faces/heads are not shown, but their bodies are so hot so this is not really a problem. Loads of p***y and a** shots so look elsewhere if raw, unabashed nudity offends.Most of the girls are shown doing the booty clap or shake dance, but a few of the girls do a full, sexy, hot performance. There's even a chick who does a really hot floor routine that will leave you throbbing! Another hot part of this dvd is a pregnant dancer who gets hot and nasty despite a slightly protruding belly and two of the performers will leave you wondering, ""male or female???"" Hot action all over this one and there's even a nice scene for all you fisting affectionados out there!"
3,What the...?,"Sounds great. Real CD quality audio, just as I had hoped for. But ""Shi no Buto"" cuts out during the guitar solo. A total track time of 4:18. The actual song is 5:25. I find this to be more of an annoyance than anything. Had I known, I wouldn't have payed for this crap. I would have just payed more and bought the albums separate. However, I am overall pleased with the CD, fake or not. It's better sounding than MP3s."
1,Please be aware,"Any Malice Mizer c.d., such as this one, that combines two seperate albums, is a fake."
4,eckhart,"ok, not one of his best, still interesting and thought provoking. not too keen on the music which accompanied the programme."
2,Make sure you are in the right frame of mind for this one!,"After listening to ""Practicing Power of Now"" I thought I was ready to move up to this set. I was wrong!!! This set is VERY heavy in concepts, and the first 4 discs are a lot about history and theory, and not a lot about actions and putting it into practice in your life. You definitely have to be patient, and be willing to devote your entire attention to this. It's not one you can listen to in the car while you are driving."
5,Music a no-go,"As always, I loved listening to Eckhart. The guided ""Gateways"" are great but I feel the music was awful. I found it to be very irritating. I am sure I will not listen to the second CD that has the music on it again. There is music here and there on the first CD too and it would have been better had it been left out."
3,Disappointed,"I was interested in listening to Eckhart Tolle speak and this was advertised as a 2 CD set. However, while Mr. Tolle's voice was strong, fascinating and convincing...he lectures on only one of the CDs and the second CD is only the music used in the interlude between ""chapters"" of his lectures on the first CD. So it was more music than education and I was disappointed.The only plus is that now that I am reading his books....I can still recall what his voice would sound like as I read his words."
1,Not worth the money,"Lights jump all over the place, has a hard time telling which string your plucking. Definately not worth it! Might as well spend a little more money on something that will actually work."
2,You'd Find Better Information on the Web,"This book is a disappointment. Honestly, you'd find better information on Portland Citysearch or any website that compiles family stuff.The book doesn't list hours and days that places are open. That's a drag when you drive your whole family somewhere (not easy with a baby!) and it's CLOSED MONDAYS."
1,"Horrible, stopped working after 1 week.","This product is junk in my eyes. I installed it per the instructions, put it UNDER an overhang and after 1 week, the light would not come on. Complete waste of money. Amazon should pull this product from it's website or fear ruining their reputation."
3,"Solar Powered, Motion/IR Detector Outdoor Light","Low cost, easy to install and set up. Perfect for walkways and any area around the home where a little more ""light security"" is needed but where outlets or electricity are not accessible. Multiple settings for light and detector position as well as for motion/IR and light/dark sensitivity, and ""light on"" duration. The manufacturer says that the battery should last 3 years - with minimal/modest use that is exactly how long my unit's battery lasted! Besides the hassle of having to take the entire unit down and apart to replace the battery, it is probably overall more cost effective to just buy another unit and put the new one up anyway."
4,Excellent Photographs and Anecdotes,"Glaviano captures the beauty of each model with amazing composition and attention to detail. His use of light, shadow, textures, etc. is marvelous. Almost every photograph is a gem and demonstrates the astute eye of Glaviano. The accompanying anecdotes are nice as well; giving us a look at the personality of the photographer as well as his personal take on the models he has photographed."
5,This CD is amazing,Alycia has an amazing voice that is mature beyond her years. I highly recommend this CD.
3,Pretty Fun....despite blatant Mountain Dew plugs...,"The Hulk for Gamecube is a good time. The controllersa re easy to use, the levels are challenging, and the interface is fun. The only downside, and it's enough to lower my rating from 4 stars to three, is the insufferable Mountain Dew plugs. Can't we at least keep the advertising out of video games?"
2,Fun For About 20 Minutes,"I'm sorry all you Hulk fans out there, but this game is one of the worst games I've ever played. It brings me back to the super nintendo days. Graphics are horrible (except in the cut-scenes), terrible camera system, and the Banner missions all make for one bad, repetative game. And when I say repetative, I mean you get deja vu everytime you walk into the next poorly designed ""factory"" or ""science lab"" level. There are only about 5 different enemies, which you will face many, MANY times. The story is so convoluded, there shouldn't have even been a story in the first place. And the objectives, oh the objectives. Since when does destroying a giant gamma orb solve all of life's problems? I'm serious, in every friggin level, it has you destroying a gamma orb (or something closely related to one). It does have its high points though, it's a little fun kicking waves of mutated dogs around a big empty room until they die.Overall- 2/5"
2,The Hulk is the hulk,"It is green, it is huge and you smash and kill. Being Banner is a nice feature to it because for once you have to use your wits! For the rest - just smash, smash, smash - boring."
4,Actually a great game,"This game might appear to be another botched film to game conversion at first glance, however upon further investigation it reveals itself to be a highly satisfying romp. The different powers the Hulk posseses are great fun and the controls for the Hulk are smooth and his actions are highly satisfying to control. When you aren't playing as the Hulk you must stealth through a few levels as Bruce Banner these aren't bad but not much fun either just there to further the storyline and make you appreciate how much fun it is to destroy stuff as the big green guy. The game also looks and sounds terrific. There are some side games and unlockable items that make it a fun game to return to as well. Recommended for the comic book/vg fan."
4,Fun to be the Hulk bad to be Bruce,The game is fun to play you can beat the light out of any enemieswhen you are the Hulk .But being Bruce is a little to hard if your enemie hit you 4 times you will turn into the Hulk and the next thing you know you faild. The game is challenging those of you who like challenge shoul get this one. I got my for $18.
1,Short lifespan.,I have been through two bulbs and I have stoped replacing them. They don't last very long.
3,"Interesting, but falls short","I'm a deticated Myst/D'ni fan, and I was a bit disapointed by the BoD. The begining of this novel is as enchanting and interesting as the other two novels in the series, but once they link to Terahnee, the plot becomes very limited and predictable. A deadline took a great toll on the ending as well - it's confusing, rushed, and unclear. Also, There isn't much to learn about the D'ni culture from this book. The sole purpose of this book seems to be to raise a countless amount of questions about the universe. Despite this, I still recomend it, but it's certainly a change in the series."
4,The Best of the Trilogy,"This book was the best of the trilogy, I thought. With that being said, it was more enjoyable having the knowledge of the other 2 books though.One of the blessings and shortcomings of the book is the speed in which events happen. Every page/chapter has something new happening and doesnt weigh you down with dragging monotonous occurrences and detail. BUT, sometimes events take place at an alarming rate which makes one wonder how the hell things happened that quickly. One example is toward the end of the book when a council seemingly forms and is organized overnight with no mention of it beforehand.Anyway, anything negative is small and really not an issue with the visuals and story within the sentences.For any Myst fan, this is a great read but I would consider reading the other 2 books beforehand. For any fantasy fan, this is still a good story, but its not as action packed as most fantasy novels, and you may be missing much if you, again, havent read the prior books."
1,The MYST mystery!,"As soon as I started the original MYST game I was hooked. The preceding two books were excellent and intriguing. I was absorbed and transported to the MYST universe. However, this last book was an incredible disappointment. The logic of it still puzzles me today. If the series was a show of fireworks, this one represents the falling cinders."
4,"Good storyline, a little dry at times though","A very interesting continuation of the myst storyline. It was interesting to discover how and where the previous myst characters ended up. The beginning of the book is slow to get started (about the first 1/3 of the book). The first time I started reading it, I didn't finish due to the boring beginning. After that, however, it picks up. The style of book is quite similare to the previous books, and is filled with beauty, awe and mystery. As compared to the previous books, it is not as good, but good enough. I give it four stars."
4,The Myst series is a must if you enjoy the game,"This book is a wonderfull mystery about the rebuilding of D'ni and an incridible find while sifting through the ruins of the ancient city.Another realm is found to explore....a land of great wealth, beauty, plenty, which holds such wonderfull promise for the survivors who the inhabitants of this land invite to join them in thier land of plenty.....but a dark secret soon turns everything upside down."
2,"A strange, confusing, and mediocre book.","I felt this book to be not as good as the other two. I found the plot dissapointing, and the title awkward. It seemed to lack the wonder and the magic that was apparent in the other books. Further, while the other books, (The Book of Atrus and the Book of Ti'ana) had strong endings, this book had a very weak one. I would suggest it only to someone who is either extremly bored with their lives, or is dying of curiosity to find out what happens to Catherine and Atrus after you last see them in Riven, and really, I would rather have left it up to my imagination, then buy this book."
2,Totally out of character!!!,"The third in the Myst series, this one is the worst! The authors obviously didn't put as much thought or work into this story as the other books. Atrus' character is definitely not what we were led to believe in the first two books...how in the world (especially in D'ni) could he not be more observant and find out WHY things were the way they were for a person committed to studying detail. Transition was weak and rushed from the rebuilding of D'ni to get to this other world to tell the REAL story. Ending was rushed and predictable."
4,Not as good as the other two,"This book is a good book to add to your Myst collection. But it wasn't as good as the other two. It seemed like they rushed to finish it throughout the second half of the book. If you haven't read Myst: The book of Tiana or Myst: The book of Atrus, I recomend you read them first."
2,"Okay, but not a lot there to sink your teeth in.","Maybe I missed something by not having read either of the first two books or played the computer games. However, be that as it may, I found MYST to be relatively tedious and almost completely devoid of any kind of action. I guess I am too used to the likes of Tolkien, Eddings, etc. and their kind of fantasy-adventure story. If you want a lot of fast-paced action and sit-on-the-edge-of-your-chair type suspense, I would suggest that you avoid MYST."
2,Myst: The Book of D'ni great book or waste of time?,"This book is definitely a well written and very descriptive one however after getting over half way into the book I wanted to call it quits. This book is time-consuming and tedious I wouldn't recommend it to people that want to just cruise along quickly through a book. If you do choose to read this book I propose this to you that you are a person that pays attention extremely strong to every last insignificant facet of the book. Even though the worlds are well described and very comprehensive they are somewhat exhaustive in the level of detail and lack of a good story line. Yes there is of course the dark evil twist to the story, but still it is my personal opinion that unless you are completely enthralled in all of the Myst related paraphernalia and have lots of vacant time to burn then yeah go ahead read the book. Best of luck to you... hope you enjoy."
1,Awful. Target audience appears to be 6th-8th graders.,"I am a huge fan of the Myst and Riven games. The richness and detail of the games left me wanting to know more of Atrus' world.I read all three books and this one has to be the worst of the bunch (the other two were not good either). The characters are shallow and the plot predictable. The story was straight out of a bad B movie script. The writing is directed at middle school levels.There was tremedous opportunity to tell a compelling tale based on the games. Instead of exploring the richness of detail introduced in the games, the books wimp out and offer nothing thought provoking. A big disappointment."
5,The Best Book,"Myst The book of D'ni is very interesting book. It was intriguing and easy to read. This book is about how master Atrus and his wife, Catherine, survivors of fallen D'ni came back to rebuild a once beautiful city.Traveling form one age to another, Atrus and Catherine were looking for survivors, who were willing to go back and help rebuilt the D'ni. Every age differ from each other and not in every age Atrus were able to find survivors, but every survivor took the offer and moved back from the ages they once escaped for survivor. One of the ages that Atrus and his helpers visited was an age of Terahnee - the world of utopia were everything is perfect, the world they only could imagine, with spectacular waterfalls, lush fields, rich music, and astonishing architecture. But is the world as Atrus and others saw was real or what they though it was? Finding out the truth about Terahnee made change Atrus and his helpers mind.I enjoyed reading this book. It was intriguing and easy to read."
4,"Good, but not the best.","Somewhat of a let-down, especially since it allmost all takes place in Tehranee, not D'ni. But good none-the-less."
5,THIS BOOK IS UN-BELIEVABLE,"Jeez, how can I describe this book in ONLY 1,000 words! It's just the best. I already read it, but am still carring it around because I love it so much!! I've read several great classics, for example, The Good Earth. This book is just as good and ranks right up there with shakespere, etc. I am 11 years old, but will remember this book FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!"
4,Read before buying a Grey,"I was set on buying an African Grey so I purchased this book in advance. It has wonderful specific information on Greys. I haven't read any other books specifically written about Greys, but this book convinced me that a Grey was not for me. It helped me to realize that this type of parrot was too much for me to handle. Great book to read prior to buying a African Grey for the first time...or for the new owner."
3,Adequate book for parrot enthusiasts,"This is an adequate book and a good value for the money. The color prints make it a good buy so don't hesitate to buy it as a gift for a youngster.Still, THE AFRICAN GREY PARROT HANDBOOK, and KEEPING AFRICAN GREY PARROTS are far better in every respect for those adults among you.Buy AFRICAN GREY PARROTS for your loved one. It's well worth the eight dollars! But buy KEEPING AFRICAN GREY PARROTS, or THE AFRICAN GREY PARROT HANDBOOK for YOURSELF!"
5,VERY GOOD BOOK,"It is a great book, answering everything an owner has to know for an African Grey parrot."
5,Must read for Grey owners,"This book covers everything a Grey owner needs to know. Very informative, easy read, concise and will help you understand your Grey and how to care for it properly and avoid health and behavioural problems. The better you understand your bird, the more rewarding your relationship will be."
5,works great,"I like this product so far. it preforms how I expected to. I would buy it again. the resistance is perfect for a female beginner. not too hard and not too easy. the length is perfect too, I am about 5'6."
1,JUNK!,"Ordered this for a ""gag"" gift. Box came like it had gone thru the war...broken and opened. Item inside was broken. RETURNED. Got a second one. Batterty door as said in other reviews was totally broken into bits. RETURNED. Just got a third one which looked exactly like the first one! Think they just resent it! Disappointed in lack of quality control AMAZON! Woud rate this zero if I could."
1,Hideous,Cheep and the olive looks like a plastic eyeball. I could not think of any reason in the world I would display it so I returned it.
1,no idea how to change out batteries,Cheap. Should have ease changing out batteries but no such luck. Plastic piece to connect batteries broke. Overpriced. Not happy
4,Fits contemporary bedroom perfectly,"Love it! The only thing is that the lamp isn't bright enough (so I'm giving it 4 stars) to actually light up the room, but it's a pretty little night-light. It also fits contemporary bedroom perfectly. First one was to try things on, and I'm buying second one right now for the bedroom."
3,Very cute for the bar area!,I got this for my sisters husband one year to put behind the bar in their house. Since mys sister had bought the pictures with the little olive people swimming in martini glasses I thought they might like this and they do. Its very cute!
2,Smaller than appears from the image.,"I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend's mother for Christmas. They have 2 Dachshunds, and I thought this would be really cute.They were received fairly well, but I was disappointed, they seemed much larger from the picture here on Amazon. They're really small."
5,GREAT gift for the weenie-dog-owner,"Our receptionist at work has two weenies and she LOVES weenie-dog themed gifts. I've never seen her as happy as i did when I gave her this for her birthday. She even likes that they poop out the salt/pepper. She insists I give it 5 stars..I'd also like to note, as another reviewer did before me, that they are smaller than they appear in the photo. they're about 2-2.5 inches long per-dog. The brown part of them is a soft pliable rubber and the mid-section clearly a stainless steel."
2,Cute but super tiny,"I wish I would have paid better attention to their actual size. They are very small. They are cute for a novelty gift however, they are definitely to small for any practical use."
3,Novelty,"Pretty much a novelty item. We being Dachshund people, they go well in the house but be careful when using. The single hole in the back side requires care when dispensing salt or pepper."
1,waste of money,"I love dachshund dogs, and saw this product. it looks great at the picture but it is really small and uncofortable to use, I put it away-for me it was a waste of money"
4,"not a toy, but good","The questions on the review are calling this a toy. Its actually salt and pepper shakers. Its a wonderful product, but not a toy."
4,"Very nice, but not the reddish color shown...","This vase is a nice size, and very sturdy; however, it's more of a walnut color. Even though it wasn't the color I hoped for, I still thought it was beautiful and decided to keep it."
5,Great Anniversary Present...,"Great service through Amazon.com! The perfume, Spark by Liz Claiborne, has been off of the regular market for a couple years now. However, my wife love it and was thrilled I was able to find it in several locations. Never ordered non-literary items from Amazon.com before. Had expected it much later than it arrived. As my wife had used the last possible drop from her previous bottle, the elegant bottle of Spark had a timely arrival, albeit a few days before our anniversary."
5,Great price on my favorite perfume,I got 1oz. of this favorite perfume of mine for $23.00 in a store and I'm getting 3.4 oz. for $18 on Amazon..amazing deal..Thanks Amazon
1,very disappointed,"I ordered this perfume for my mother for mothers day, it came in a yellow manilla envelope with no box or anything it did not have a lid on the bottle and the spritzer was taped to the side of the perfume bottle. It looked very strange and I was very leary of it. I went ahead and just gave it to my mom the day it came since it was not worth giving as a gift, and she sprayed it and it had a very funny smell. She has used this perfume brand many times before and it was not the same. I was very disappointed and will never buy anything online again like that."
5,kids love these,"I am not old enough to remember the original fizzies, I bought a package of green apple fizzies as a stocking stuffer for my diabetic son 2 years ago.He loved them, and I have been buying them ever since. I love that they are fun and different but sugar free - it can be hard to be a kid and can't have all the fun candy like your friends. My other (not diabetic) son loves them as well - I don't buy soda, so they are like a special treat.Make sure you use the 6 oz. water as directed, the first time we made a drink we were so disappointed with how watered down it was - ooops! we used about 3x the amount of water."
3,useful,"This book won't write your bood for you...but it ever gets finished, this provides some tips, expecially for writing query letters, etc."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Manic, comic strippy silliness. Occasionally a little hard to follow. Monkey Punch man obviously likes all his girls exactly the same, looks, build and level of sneakiness. Did not thrill me at all, I don't think I would bother with any more of these. I can't fault him on the former, but if he keeps falling for the latter?"
1,QUALITY COMPLAINT.,"Bought as new, the picture quality of this video can only be described as AWFUL. After only a few minutes viewing I trashed it. It is a disgrace that unsuspecting buyers should receive goods of such a low standard from both ""Timeless Video Inc"" and ""Madacy Entertainment""."
3,GOOD AT FIRST BUT...,"I bought this and the male counterpart for my twins when they were just one year olds. It was a great toy when used in its rocker stage. They spent that whole winter on them. However now that they are almost three, they are able to reach the pedals but the trike doesn't move. My creative kids have found a way to solve this, they start at the top of the driveway and coast down a small hill. It was a great toy when they were younger, but I am disappointed that the pedals don't work."
4,"My grandaughter loves to rock,roll and ride","The rock, roll, and ride xl trike is perfect for a young child. My grandaughter who just turned 1 will sit and rock on it for hours before her mom takes her for a spin around the park. It is solid and has many different ways to move."
5,Exemplary,"This is Blessid Union's first album in a post 9/11 America. What we must be cognizant of when considering an album like this from a deeply personal and intelligent such as BUOS is that they are going to sound different; there is going to be a different feel altogether. Life in America has changed and musicians reflect this in their music. Listen to the lyrics of this album, the instrumentation and Elliot's magnificent vocalizations. You will not be disappointed, you will be moved."
3,"""BUOS Not At Their Best"".","This is not what I expected from this wonderful & talented band 'Blessid Union Of Souls', in the 2005 CD release titled ""Perception"". I own their previous wonderful, solid & inspiring CD releases, ""Home"", "" Blessid Union Of Souls"" & ""Walking Off The Buzz"". This CD is certainly below parr when compared to their previous releases. The CD has 16 tracks, with solid two tracks, ""I Still Believe In Love"" & ""Better Side Of Me"" [rated 5 stars each]. Other six notable track include, ""Could've Been With You"", ""Wild Side Of Me"", ""A Thousand And One"", ""Let's Get Out Of Here"", ""Say Hello To My Little Friend"" & ""I was Never Here"" [rated 4 stars each]. The remaining 8 tracks are either ordinary [rated 3 stars] or weak [rated 2 stars] tracks.My overall rating of this album is 3,44 stars which approximates 3 stars : it is a good effort from this great band, but they can certainly produce a better release/product if their past releases have something to go by!"
4,Blessid keeps it awesome!,"I have been a huge Blessid fan since Home. Their style, their lyrics, their harmony - it's always struck a chord (no pun intended) in me that no other band has. Perception is no different. The ballads on the CD are by far the best: Better Side of Me, I Still Believe in Love, and (my favorite song on the CD) Lets Get out of here. They can really stir up emotions. The faster songs are good too - like ""Wild Side of Me"" and ""Could've been with you"" sound like the fantastic Blessid that we know. Overall, it's amazing Blessid. And I'm counting down until I can hear them live again!!!!! I hope they get everything settled and get out on tour soon."
2,Not Nearly as good as the others...,"I am a big Blessid Union fan, and this CD was not nearly as good as the others. There isn't any strong ballads at all on this CD. The songs seemed quickly put together, and there isn't any one song that stands out as being great. I am very disappointed!!!"
5,Y-cable,"Although the pictures on the Amazon site didn't actually show that this is a Y-type cable, I knew from a visit to an Apple retail store what I needed to make the correct connections for my 2nd gen iPod and my new MacBook Pro. Price was OK and shipping was quick. Everything works as advertised."
4,a pleasant read for history buffs,"This book will give you a clear picture of a much-maligned family, and will certainly present you with an altogether different image of Lucrezia Borgia. The book itself combines good history-writing with reasonable storytelling. Mr. Mallett is a university professor and it shows in his style; the backflap review suggesting you will be ""riveted"" by his storytelling-talents is only true if you are easily riveted. For more entertaining writing, Marion Johnson's book on the subject just has the edge. This is a good effort, though and the story itself has much to entertain you."
2,Slow and to be taken with a grain of salt,"Plodding and dull and, what's worse, not even objective. He defends the Borgias no matter what. It was okay for Alexander to have about 8 children, and one possible after become Pope. But he did (Alexander, that is) keep his affairs private. That makes it all right. Whatever Cesare did, it was justified, including murder. Whatever bad they (Alexander and Cesare did) was only rumor, innuendos or reported by enemies, and not based on facts. However, when it comes to the enemies, the rumors are accepted as ""most likely."" Evenhanded does not apply to this book.And worse, it is boring."
1,"Boring ,overly-loaded with irrelevant detail","The author treats his audience like a class of students who have signed up for a last minute exam review of Italian rennaissance political history to which the Borgias are a footnote. This class is obviously doomed.He needs to read the works of Carolly Erickson and Al'Tabari atleast to learn how to make history a pleasure to read whilst providing focussed information.At the very least, man, read Antonia Frasier!Though dry she is at least succinct.A disappointing read."
2,iffy at best,"This review book is helpful in that it gives you a lot of background information to study, such as pages of prefixes and suffixes. Unfortunately, they didn't double-check the answers in the practice exams- I've found 2 errors so far in the first practice exam alone. My advice would be to purchase the book, and study it, but don't take the exams- they'll only confuse you as to which answer is truly correct."
1,Old Pronouncing Dictionary of Musical Terms,"Old Pronouncing Dictionary of Musical Terms that is nearly unusable with an index and some organization. I'm not sure that this possible, but I find this Kindle product nearly unusable."
1,Only good for aimless browsing.,"My first reaction upon opening this book was a teeth--clenched ""Oh COME ON!""It didn't get better.Switching to Landscape mode makes it marginally readable, but this book is unusable as a reference.At $.99, it's no more than a heartless tease...>>PLEASE Understand: This is a review of the Kindle Edition ONLY.The Paper-and-Paste edition is probably delightful!"
2,the girl who leapt through time,i bought this movie from the 5 star reviews it got here.after watching this movie i gave it 2 stars .this movie is one of the hardest to get into and my kids lost interest after 20 mintues.i think these movies are really over rated here.for the price i think this movie was a dud!!!
4,Delightful and Tight time-travel yarn,"I found this movie to be thoroughly enjoyable and fairly solid - for the time travel genre.It's like a mystery and a teen coming-of-age story, wrapped up in the mind-bending logic of time travel. And for that last distinction, it does fairly better than many with only one or two holes.It's family friendly and not so disorienting as to be indecipherable."
5,Really nice done,"Really interesting idea, will be nice to see a long development of the movie maybe a short series. overall really good."
4,Thoughtful anime gem,"My husband and I have been Miyazaki fans for some time now, but haven't explored other anime films that much. We just had the opportunity to see TGWLTT and were utterly charmed. It's a big encouragement to widen our anime horizons. Not only is it a memorable love story between two remarkable youngsters, it is a morality tale about adult responsibility and how a teenaged girl is compelled to grow into it--nearly at the cost of the lives of innocent people. What she is doing--jumping back in time to make trivial changes in her life--proves to be fantastically dangerous. The time travel schtik is merely the fuel source that enables the engine of the story to tick along. This is all about making bad decisions and good decisions--the stuff of adult life. Also, the lankier, sparer look of the anime style (vs. Miyazaki) is enchanting in its own way. A little more minimalist, but that's fine. Just a terrific film and highly recommended."
5,"Not much to say besides, ""Perfect in every way!""",Exactly as described; on time shipping and even receiving!; good communication...the whole process was quick and a pleasure to work with. I couldn't have asked for better :)
4,Great family movie,"Bought this movie for my teenage daughter and she loved it. This story is appropriate for all ages, which is very nice for a Japanese movie. The story will most interest tweeners and teens but it is a film that adults will find interesting. Best of all, as a parent, younger kids can watch too, but they may not be able to follow the story which jumps back an forth through time."
4,The Girl who leapt through Time,"Another good movie,interesting and definitely worth adding to a serious collectors collection,it really is down to personal preference so my opinion is yes,worth buying,and again,it is my own opinion and I am sure there will be those who agree and those who dont."
3,Teen age angst,"If you are into teen age angst you will like this. Otherwise, not so much. I fell in love with summer wars but was really disappointed on this one"
3,Leapin' lizards!,"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time - Yet another movie about sensitive girls and time travel, the story is exactly like the title describes. Makoto is a sensitive tomboy who hangs out with her two male buddies, playing baseball after school. Through an accident that is explained later, she develops the ability to leap into the air, causing her to return to a moment in the recent past so that she can solve some small problem or other. They are generally quite trivial, but she does save a life or two. She also engineers relationships, while also learning about her own love."
3,the girl who LITERALLY lept through time,"This is a cute film if you're looking for something short that is of the anime genre. However, I wasn't aware that the title and the cover illustration were so literal. That aside, it's not bad for rainy-day entertainment."
3,Decent Beginner's Guide to Rotisserie Baseball,"Okrent and Waggoner can take credit for basically inventing Rotisserie baseball; however, their analysis of the game hasn't progressed at all since the early 80s. If you've just started a league, you could do worse than to use their rules and game structure; it's been tested by time and it works.However, their player analysis is guaranteed to be months out of date, and their suggested prices do not -- repeat, do not -- work in any league that pays attention. It's fun to read, and a good governance guide, but look elsewhere for strategy, tactics, and pricing."
4,Best Overall Rotisserie Book Available,"I have bought this book for years and every year it comes in handy. A must for any commissioner who is starting their league. Rules are from the founding fathers (of Rotisseire) and probably the best available. The author adds wit to the evaluations which make it easy to read. I couldn't recommend a better book on Roto. Michael Sinco, Commisioner, Willow Creek Rotisserie League"
3,The best rules reference available. Fair player predictions,"If your a first or second year player, or you've recently started your own league, this book is a perfect rules reference guide. It's easy to read, and provides rules for drafting, and conducting business throughout the season. Glen Waggoner also gives his predictions (player value) for the upcoming season. These are fair, at best. Prior year stats are given, but there's little information given about the intangibles."
4,Useful and Well-written,This book is required reading for me in a psychiatric nurse practitioner program. This book has great ideas for learning diagnostic criteria and for eliciting information from our patients. It is also well-written and pleasant to read.
4,A wonderfully useful read,This a a useful book for those seeing psychiatric patients in a clinical setting. It offers pointers and summaries that are particularly useful to clinicians.
1,Not recommended,"I cannot recommend this book. I'm an avid collector of Zep shows, and was amazed at the falsehoods printed in this book. This is also not a complete guide. I found myself looking in this book for several widely available boots that are either not listed, or lists tracks or other info incorrectly. If you're interested in reading more about Zep in concert and live tapes, get Luis Rey's Led Zeppelin Live."
3,So So,"I was waiting to recieve this book for a long time, but was dissapointed with it. I felt like there is not enough information about cosmetic options. The book says a lot about ""dentist fobia"" and how to brush your teeth properly, but not much about cosmetic dentistry."
5,What a debut!,"This is an excellent debut CD. The title track, ""Slow Down,"" also written by Michelle Walker, is my personal favorite on the CD. Ms. Walker's voice and her interpretation of the other songs she performs on the CD make it a great listen."
2,Don't get this one THERE's MORE!,"I unwittingly purchassed this not realizing there is a two disk version. Don't get me wrong the concert is amazing, perhaps one of U2's best ever, but let's be honest a superfan like me is after the extra features, this single disk version doesn't have those. GET THE TWO DISK EDITION!"
2,A little dry,"This is one of the few books that I have started and then quit part way through. I had to force myself to continue reading after about page 50 and then quit at 200. It was very dry content and read too much like a doctoral dissertation. In addition, assumptions were made about the readers knowledge of court cases related to civic rights."
2,A shame.,"A great song selection, a great singer, but some lousy production. ""Only Women Bleed"" is the only number that shakes loose of the smooth-jazz format this CD is killed by. She's made better before and since - get this only if you REALLY want ""Only Women Bleed"" in it's 90s version. It's excellent."
4,Etta records great selection of standards,"I am always surprised at how natural Etta handles cabaret songs. She brings her feel for the blues and bends her vocals just so to totally capture the jazz feel of some of the great standards. Not every song is a standard, however even the newer ones have the same style. On most tracks, the band gives the songs a combo feel. When the production is a little more full blown, it is still very simple and never feels heavy handed. Almost worth the price of admission, is Etta's updated treatment of her hit ""At Last"". So turn the lights down low, cuddle up with someone special and enjoy Etta as she explores the Heart of a Woman."
4,Great Music,"This is the perfect album to listen too at night when you are relaxing. Etta James has a great voice and I found this album very good. The one song I found surprisingly well was her version of the Alice Cooper song, ""Only Women Bleed"". The album has a jazzy vocal sound to it as oppossed to straight easy listening. ""You Dont Know What Love Is"", ""Sunday Kind Of Love"", ""I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good"", are a few more of the outstanding songs found here in this collection. the one thing that will have listeners playing this over and over is the sound of Etta's amazing voice."
3,Pretty Good,ETTA JAMES CAN SING/SANG PERIOD.but the material here that she has to work with doesn't match Her GREAT Talent.HER OLDER ALBUMS have more Grit to them than this one.still Hearing Her Sing is Fantastic to the Human Ear Drum.SHe is one of the Baddest Female Singers ever.&one of the Greatest SOUL Singers ever Period.but this disc doesn't showcase it fully.
4,Based upon reviews -have decided to purchase book,"From what I have gathered, it sounds like a fun book, although from the reviews, I'm not certain if it completely adheres to the traditional recipes. Being born & raised in Cuba-one thing is for certain, corn, meats, seafood, sugar & fruits here in the US have a totally different flavor-I appreciate all the helpful reviews, but people---For the love of GOD,,,Please stop referring to us as Latin or Spanish,,we're just CUBAN!Your bunching us up together in one group--and believe me,,there are worlds of difference-Example-Unlike central & south Americans, we only have 3 races in CUBA, black (strictly descendants of slaves) - whites (strictly descendants of Europeans-mostly Spaniards) and Mulatos (mix of the two)- That's it..We have no natives or native cultures, cause for the most part, the Spaniards exterminated them.Finally not to mention the fact that we do not SPEAK LATIN!!Thank you..."
4,"Great recipes, not so great banter","It's odd. I object not at all to cookbooks that are infused with the author's personal stories and flair. But this one, I'd rather just have the recipes. The recipes are remarkably good, mostly quite simple to prepare, and well-written. I use them all the time.I just pretend that the hokey over-the-top bonhomie of the authors isn't there. Mind you, this is only because I think in person, I wouldn't like them very much. But I like their food a lot, so I just focus on that."
3,I expected more.,I really expected to have a little bit more original cuban recipes. I mean the ones that are on there are great but I just expected more. It's still a very good cook book.
2,"Not a very ""Cuban"" Book","My family (who is entirely CUBAN) sat around reading the recipes of this book and began to laugh. I mean, what REAL Cuban cooks a steak in Olive Oil??? We also DO NOT eat gazpacho...that is a Latin American dish...not Cuban...why is it in a Cuban Cook Book? I was not impressed with the book and am returning it in hopes that I find something more authentic and true."
2,Cuban Food with humor,"This is an excellent beginning introduction cook book for Maimi cuban food.The recipes are very easy to follow and the ingredients are clearly explained. The only challenge I had was making Cuban bread. But I finally followed the recipe exactly and got a perfect loaf of bread. Yes I really had to roll out the dough with a rolling pin to get the bread to come out right. The writers comments just kept me reading recipes, not bad for a cook book"
2,shortfall,Not worth the money. I do not care about how the boys look. I wanted the native receipes for Cuba. I wanted some authenticity from Cuba or at least the true Miami environment.
3,Cuban Cooking???,"The recipes are OK...Some are really not CUBANIf you have not eaten REAL cuban food it will do,BUT I was not that thrilled with it.As I cook cuban I know what I am talking about.Flan=== 1 can evaporated milk 1 can condensed milk 6 eggs.. Blend well add a pinch salt & drop vanilla.Then proceed as per your instructions"
4,"Very nice, with attitude!","Some great recipes, with cultural anecdotes and the authors' witty style. I love the recipes and the ""local color"". I think you'll like it too!"
5,The best Cuban cookbook in my collection......,"Beautiful book containing 100 recipes that have been tested andperfected through the years by these three brothers-in-law who also happen to be great friends. easy on the eye, with well written and clean looking pages most containing beautiful color photographs of the food, the authors and Miami. In a congenial and chatty way, these three friends discuss each recipe in the book using short and sometimes funny ""sound-bites"".All the traditional Cuban recipes are included, some with an updated twist. They have also included recipes for other Latino food that has been quickly assimilated into the Cuban recipe repertoire such as the very rich and sinfully wonderful Nicaraguan Tres Leches Cake and the Colombian Arepas, a cornmeal and cheese delicacy that has become quite a popular snack to munch on during the many Miami street festivals."
3,Not bad,"This sophomore album from Chrisinti is not as strong as his first. However, the foundation that his first album laid has certainly garnered him more attention. This album is less rootsy than the first and the vocals are not as soulful and true. His vocals are allowed to shine on only 3 tracks:Oh SheilaRuff RideDo It AgainThose are the standout tracks. The others are ordinary works.Inspiration Rock is a wek track that they felt the need to remix, and hearing it a second time on the CD was irritating.I am still looking forward to a third album, and I do still collect Chrisinti singles. My advice next time around would be let your voice free and keep preaching the works."
4,Learn how acuupuncture really got started in the western world,"Acupuncture took off slowly in the West.This book validates TCM for those with a ""scientific"" mind. It is intereasting to see how it started and what the thinking towards holistic medicine was.A good primer. Not a sit down thumb through it type book...heavy and meaty."
3,not one of the best in the series,"If you love Hardanger embroidery as I do, you will collect as many of the annual Award-Winning Designs books from Nordic Needle as you can get your hands on. Each year, the books get more and more inspiring. How cool to design your own piece and wind up having it published! This book is over 30 years old and so somewhat old-fashioned now. But several of the projects are quite nice and all pieces are show on the front or back cover in color and closer shots in B&W; inside the book. You will NOT learn how to do any stitches. My favorite sources for stitches and designing are anything from Emie Bishop's Cross 'n Patch collection and Janice Love's 2 books below:Hardanger basics and beyondFundamentals made fancy: Hardanger"
1,The least responsive merchant that I have ever dealt with on Amazon,"The product is misrepresented on the website. I have sent 3 emails about an exchange but received no feedback. I was not given a refund and in fact I received no response to any of my emails. Also, there is no telephone number I could call. It's like dealing with a ghost. I was stupid enough to use the Amazon Visa card to pay for it; if I had used AmEx, I would have at least been covered by the purchase protection and received a refund."
5,The Technical Loomis,"Another amazing work by master Illustration Mentor Andrew Loomis. This is the most 'left-brain' of his five volumes. The technical detail can seem overwhelming, but careful reading coupled with practice will teach both your head and your hand to capture realist images that break the plane of the paper and seem to establish themselves in the space before you. I would recommend to those unfamiliar with Loomis that they start with one of his more approachable works, but make sure this one is on your list as you progress in your mastery of drawing."
3,Successful Drawing,"This book is really good but it is geared for the bigginner and intermediate artist. I will not be surprised, though, if some so-called advanced artist will learn from it. As for me, I was looking for something more advanced like his other books."
2,Very flimsy product.,This product is nothing like what I thought it would be. It does not have the strength to be anything more than a decoration on the door. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Works great!,"THe laser is amazing, seems to keep its size for ever, pen writes well and it is very solid. A bargain!"
1,Never even got to use it.,"This thing is a piece of sh%!t and not even worth a penny. I dropped the battery in backwards, no big deal right? Wrong. The battery is stuck and the pen is therefore totally useless. I've tried everything to get this thing out. It's not like I jammed the battery in backwards, it fell in, and now its in the garbage.Aside from that, everything about the material screams poor quality. looks good in photo but when you handle it you will see."
3,Pulp Checklist contains valuable info,"The great pulp magazines are unfamiliar territory to many people, and this Guide offers valuable data for both the serious collector, and people with general interest in the pulps. Publishing dates, number of issues, as well as an overview of the magazines and other great information makes the Guide a valuable item. While bits and pieces of this information on individual titles are available in other forms, this is the first effort to pull it all together, including data on some very unusual and obscure titles. I found the book very useful, and I'm sure other pulp enthusiasts will too."
2,not what I expected,I was hoping that this book would be an uplifting account of hope to encourage my husband who was recently diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. It was NOT. Would not recommend it.
5,Grown Up Stylish Watch,"After over a year of use, there are no scratches on this watch -- even though my 10-year old wears it daily. He likes it because he feels he looks ""grown up."" Time is still accurate and it looks as though he will have it well into his teens."
1,"Nice Styling, But Falls Short","This is a really nice looking watch, but it's not water resistant. My son wore his 2-month-old watch in the swimming pool once (11 year old boys are a bit absent minded) and water leaked into the watch casing. There's now condensation on the inside of the crystal, and I have to pay shipping both ways to get it fixed under warranty."
4,taste the pain,"A compilation of issues, season 1 focuses on Xavier's father issues, and season 2 on his mother issues.The story of a strange traveler, who comedicaly forces violence, intolerance, and stupidity into your face and then dances around the subject with a triple entendre. You can't just watch it once, you'll miss too much."
1,"Great pilot, everything else is utterly horrible.","I remember finding the pilot to Xavier extremely funny, innovative, and strange. I must have watched it 30 times. Unfortunately the show immediately plunges into pathetic mediocrity since then. When I catch Xavier on TV, I wonder how he is even able to support enough ratings to actually have a DVD."
5,THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ ON CARY GRANT!,"If you want to find out everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - about Cary Grant then this is the book for you. All other books, including the latest biog, are glitzy and frothy and tell you nothing you hadn't already read if you are a big fan. Also some are not as revelationary as they would like to think.If you are a serious fan then you can't beat this book."
1,Dreadful Narrator,This narrator is so awful that I returned the book unread. The audiotape was flawed to the extreme and could not be enjoyed at all.
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased this publication mainly to obtain information about how men might benefit from the use of natural progesterone. I was disappointed with what I received. Dr. John R. Lee just published a booklet about hormone balancing for men, and I recommend his publication as opposed to Dr. Shealy's. This booklet had some interesting information but, if you're interested in this subject, consider a book with more indepth information."
4,Finally some answer,I selected this book because at the age of 53yrs I thought I was losing my mind and I needed some answers. I got just what I was looking for and I recommendthis to any woman who needs help deciding what is best for her in the changing years.
4,Informational,I ordered this and other books about NATURAL hormones as I was having trouble with the standard hormone pills. After all the information I read (including this book) I am now using a compounded bio identical hormone that seems to be working the best for me.
3,BRONTE COLLECTION,"Well... loved THE TENANT OF WILDFELL AND JANE EYRE - However, WUTHERING HEIGHTS is really, really old version - sound is horrible, actors are not that good either.:/"
5,Best Christmas Video!,"I have loved this movie for a long time. It is my favorite movie to watch at Christmas. I make chai tea, get all my gift wrapping materials and as I wrap gifts I watch the movie. I find myself singing along. I feel that this is the best adaptation of the Christmas Carol story by Dickens. I may watch it 4-5 times during the Christmas holidays."
2,Find an extended life battery,"Really appreciate the ease of switching these out, but it only worked as promised for about a week or two, and then wouldn't hold a charge for more than an hour. Very disappointing performance for an OEM battery of this type.You might get more life out of it by not deep cycling, i.e., keeping your PDA in the charging cradle and not letting the battery drain almost completely before recharging.. or so I've read.After my experience with this battery, I would not pay more than $10 for a new one. In fact, I'd rather buy an extended life battery, so I could use my PDA for more than an hour.. or maybe two of these? Nope."
4,Great buy for the money!,"I have twins and they spend HOURS in these fabulous bouncy seats. The price was right and the fabric is really cute. They take a 'D' battery so they go forever and you don't need a screwdriver to change the battery like on some other seats I've seen. The toys are great any my babies love to bat at them. The toys also attach with velcro so you can remove them and play with them even when the baby is not actually in the seat. My only complaint is that I have tripped over the corner of the seat and stubbed my toes many times, but that could have happened with any bouncy seat of this style. I highly recommend this product!"
4,Episode 58 A Must See,They said that episode 58 in that series had the highest TV ratings in TV to that date.This was where Kagome was so emotional thinking Inuyasha died from a fall in human form but the plant saved him and the sun began to rise to make Inuyasha a half demon again. The ending was very funny.
5,Curse of the Dark Priestess!,"Volume 20 of the INUYASHA series proves pivotal with the following episodes:* Fateful Night in Togenkyo, Part II* Beautiful Sister Apprentices* The 50-Year Curse of the Dark PriestessOverall, these are great episodes!"
1,Never purchase from this company..........,"Purchased the product and waited......... and waited......... and waited. After numerous calls I finally was able to get through to the ""customer service"" representative. I was told that they sent the product, but they forgot to put a tracking number on it, (suspicious). Waited another week after they told me that they would send another ""express"". Just before my fingers did the dialing I received an email from the company stating that they will not be sending the product and they would attempt to refund my money!!!!!!!!!!So... I waited to long for the product from this particular company, and missed my opportunity for application, so I would not use them.I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN..........Thoroseal is GREAT, don't use this company for the product, look somewhere close to home to purchase it, because if you wait like me you will have missed the good weather to apply it, and then have to wait until it stops raining."
1,"Nice pan, but the coating has started coming off","I purchased one of these Vollrath frying pans at a local retail store. The pan did fine for a while, but then the non-stick coating began coming off the center part of the pan. We only used plastic and wooden utensils with this pan, so it is not our fault the coating is coming off. Vollrath only warrants their pans for 90 days, so I am just out of luck. I wish I had bought a $10 pan from Walmart rather than this one. I hope you have better luck than I did with this rather pricy piece of cookware."
3,Eh.. hmm...,"Personally, Rozz stands over Valor in any Christian Death version comparison. Valor hardly cuts it at times with the rest of the gang, but this album was done alone. Three songs have lyrics, the others are either brought down with repetition or it's more experimental/noise. The one song I found to be very interesting was Wind Kissed Pictures. Other than that, the first song was decent and one of the only two tracks that really sounded good. Valor's attempts in the beginning were ok, but not all that great. My advice, try the newer ""Valor Versions"" before you even think about touching the old ones."
2,When things get out of hand,"I caught part of this movie tonight. It was the funniest shoot 'em up I've ever seen.Two guys start shooting at each other in a bar/saloon during a show. The next thing you know everyone in the bar is shooting at each other, and anyone and anything that is moving. Furniture is flying everywhere, pianos are falling down the stairs, and soon the shoot out spreads to the streets. Horses are running, wagons are crashing in the street, flipping over for no apparent reason and fires are breaking out all over. It is right out of Blazing Saddles...strange."
3,Predictable horse opera,"Overall, this is a pretty good western, although I had to sit through it twice before I decided I liked it.Errol Flynn is his usual, hansome self. He plays a Texan who lost everything to rustlers. He was shot and badly wounded, but escapes to recover in Mexico.When he finds evidence that will convict the man responsible for the raids and rustling, he returns to San Antonio to deliver justice.Flynn and a black hat have to ""step outside"" for some gunplay in a truly suspenseful moment. The shootout finale in the Bella Union saloon is fantastic, worthy of classic Hollywood. And there's a couple of pretty good songs delivered by a barbershop quartet and Flynn's leading lady.She has one of the best lines I've ever heard: ""People in this town are so mean, they'd step on baby chicks!""Still, this one was predictable and ultimately unsatifying. I would recommend you try an earlier Flynn western, 1939's ""Dodge City"", for Flynn as frontiersman."
2,terrible for introductory courses,"I'm using this for my first algorithm course at college and I have to say that this is a terrible book for me at my current level. The book does not have a thorough explanation on any data structures. The analysis in algorithms are unclear. It skips a lot of fundamentals, too. And a lot of the time it gives superficial but confusing instructions on what you should understand. I'm assigned this book by a professor who basically can't teach, which makes this course a nightmare for me."
2,not a book for beginners,"If you don't know Java, don't expect to be able to learn the things you need to for a class. If you learned how to do alorgithms in mathematics, it may not be enough for computer science. You probably want to get a supplemental or two if you have to get this book for class. It is quite advanced and a hard read."
1,Get it if you want to waste money,"I got this book because it was rated 4-5 stars by the readers. But this is not the case. The book does not explain any of the assumtions it makes. It directly jumps to conclusions. The book is full of huge diagrams which have little or no relevance to what he is explaining. I would never recommend this book to anyone. If you still think I am wrong , go to your book store , check out this book...and you'll see that I am correct."
2,"Good for professors, bad for students","All of the practical algorithms are left as un-answered exercises! Great in depth discussion of introductory algorithms, but very few examples, mostly pseudo-code.INFURIATING FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY, but good if you have a professor to explain everything as you go."
1,What a book!,"Hi everybody Stop right away if you have the intent to buy this book. The author wrote this book not for readers but may be for himself.I can guarantee that no student can understand the book. It's even worse if you consider the price $US80 . I'd rather donate this sum to charity than buying this ""Written by a Ph.D from Princeton"" book. It does not worth one dollar. If you bought this book you would regret! Give this sum to a beggar on NewYork sidewalks would make more sense!"
3,"Decent coverage, but lots of little issues","PROs: decent coverage of the materialCONs: mediocre writing style (""Irregardless""?) and coding style; occasional bugs/typos in example code; poor explanation of Java generics"
2,Could have been better,"I felt the author has a firm understanding of the concepts and truly what he wanted to convey, but this book lacked a great deal for beginners or newcomers to Java. Far too many of the examples were tough to understand and in many cases simply un-answered. This is not a book for beginners."
2,somewhat useless,"This book is next to useless, because of its superficial approach to almost any topic it covers. You would be hard-pressed to find a single data structure, clearly presented and explained conceptually and with examples. Many times the author would skip on the concept and would attempt to explain to you something, from the start based on examples, which would be represented by the start point and the end point with no explanation in between.I would understand if the author would omit some topics based on the premise that students should already know them, but instead he chooses to contain everything( and as a result contain nothing in particular).On the other hand in more ""advanced"" topic sections it is not unusual to find statements of the sort ""beyond the scope of this book"". Which leads me (and many others) to ask, what is the scope of this book?"
4,Good deal,"So far, I've been very happy with this battery. I think it might not be quite as long-lasting as the original battery was when I first bought the phone, but this was a very affordable replacement option now that the old one has worn out. It arrived pretty quickly and was as described."
5,Battery replacement,"The battery replacements for our old cell phones work just fine, and it was easy to locate what we needed on this site."
5,new life for phones,"After having this phone for more than a year. It needed a new battery, like everything else that has batteries does."
1,Not that hot,"I bought this battery as a replacement and was promised that it will solve my frequent always dying battery problem. Guess what, same problem all over...think twice when purchasing this product..."
2,Reboot Loop,"I purchased one of these just under a year ago and it worked pretty well in my PPC6700 for a few months but then wouldn't hold a charge very long. I recently purchased another one and my phone won't even boot with it. It just continuously reboots. I had a replacement sent to me and it does the same thing. The original battery, and the replacement I received a year ago still boot up and charge so I don't believe it is the phone or the charger."
1,Not a good battery,"To be honest, this battery doesn't last much longer than the original I had for 1.5 years. I would look for a higher end battery. The price is great, but in this case it's worth it to spend the extra money."
2,"Looks used, doesn't last that long","The battery we received had scratches on the white label, came in a scratch wrinkly clear bag. It does charge but doesn't hold a charge long enough (less than a day). A new battery shouldn't look like it's been handled so much which makes me think it's refurbished."
5,Perfect Choice,This battery works perfectly with my older cell phone.Don't even give this one a second thought. Perfect.
5,EXCELENTE,"La verdad, no he leído éste, leí ""Yo a mo a mi mami"" y ""No se lo digas a nadie"". El primero es muy diferente a la temática de las primeras tres novelas. ""La noche es virgen"", ""No se lo digas a nadie"" y ""Fue ayer y no me acuerdo"" describen la temática gay. Yo amo a mi mami es una obra sublime, recomendada para cualquiera que quiera revivir en su alma las impresiones que tenía cuando niño, pero serà muy especial para alguien que viviò en Lima, como yo. Felicitaciones a Jaime!! PD:Si alguien sabe cómo mandarle un mail o como comunicarse con él, porfavor, comentenlo en amazon."

2,Honor Sin Patria,I actually had the pleasure of meeting some of the actors in this movie. They were filming parts here in TX and the plot seemed very good but when I purchased the movie I must say it could have been better. The movie was slow and forced you could tell the actors were acting. Ozzy you did a great job of editing. Better luck next time!
5,Fun and educational!,"We've had this since my son was born. He and his little sister have really enjoyed it. They love to have the animals move, search for the hiding animals, and have us read the text. A great book!"
5,I loved it.,National Geographic always put out a superior product. I bought two of these books for Christmas gifts. I always buy National Geographic if given the chance.
4,"A Good Little Book, Fun to Read","AS FOR THE QUALITY, there are tons of photos and examples in glossy vivid color. I think one of the best things about the book is that it gets your creating juices flowing. It does discuss a lot of Photoshop techniques, so those without an editing program may not enjoy it. And perhaps there is too much on printers; I prefer to send mine over the internet to companies like [...].Really advanced digital users may find it somewhat basic, but I think most users are basically intermediate, and this book fits the bill. It's chock-full of information, and there's just enough to send you in the right direction to go and explore on your own.I think it's a great ""intermediate introduction"" and I look forward to purchasing other books by Tom Ang."
1,A book for someone who does not yet own a digital camera,"I was very disappointed in this book. Perhaps this was my fault as I expected it to be more advanced than it was. The material on camera and computers was a complete waste of my time - I already have camera and computer...Also so much of the information is self-explanatory when you do your first digital editing. I already know a great deal of this and the explanations for what I do NOT know (the reason I got the book) aren't detailed enough.Also, he has a section on Quick Mask, which isn't even available in Elements 2, although he says it is... - for a new book, this needs updating NOW.I would not recommend it to anyone except a person just looking into getting a digital camera."
2,Photography? Where?,"This book, like all DK books, is very pretty and full of full-color graphics and pictures and so on. Unlike most DK books, the content is minimal and poorly written. Ang has great difficulty explaining things clearly. Of the books 220+ pages, about 40 deal (in a very nonspecific way) with the actual process of taking photos. The rest of the book consists more or less of a few dozen tips for using Photoshop. Some of the figures are wrong, and some of the sets of comparison photos are printed so small that it's impossible to tell the difference between them, stare though you will. Oh, and there's an annoying piece of Mac-evangelism towards the beginning. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
2,A Mediocre Work,"This book examines the Battle of the Atlantic from the viewpoint of code-breaking and its influence on the struggle against the U-Boats. The author takes the stand that code-breaking, radio-intercepts, and radio-direction finding were the be-all and end-all of the conflict. Very little of the other technologies and tactics are present in this book. Although the radio intercepts did play a role, they were not the decisive factor in battle. It is unfortunate that more attention was not paid to these aspects. All-in-all, therefore, it makes a meager contribution to military history."
3,Great if you have the time,"Only one complaint. If you only have a couple of weeks to come up with a proposal, it's a bit tough to implement some of the recommendations, particularly the insight legwork which comes from sales and marketing."
1,EGAD!!,"If you need to write a technical proposal to win a contract for a scientific corporation, and you like to have things explained to you with bubbles and arrows and charts, you may like this book. But my feeling is, if an author can't explain how to write a proposal with Words in Paragraphs, his proposals are going to be pretty stodgey. Maybe it's okay for proposing product purchases, but it's not going to fly for those proposing services that involve client-relation skills as part of their business."
5,Great book,"Great book, very helpful in revamping our process. We have won many more accounts as a result."
3,A well written book of limited value.,"As a person new to raising quail, I purchased this book as a guide. After reading every page, I feel 20 percent ready to start.The book is written with frequent reference to British sources. It is somewhat dated. That said, it covers many of the basics."
2,Cameta Camera Bait and Switch,"I ordered the Sakar 37mm 3 piece filter set from Cameta Camera.Instead I received the Merkury Innovations 37mm 3 piece filter set from Cameta Camera.Sakar and Merkury Innovations are DIFFERENT brands, promoted by DIFFERENT marketing companies. I've had previous negative experience with Merkury Innovations products (NiMh rechargeable batteries and battery charger.) AA batteries slightly too large to fit some devices and the charger was cheesy crap. Batteries failed in less than one year with only limited usage.Guaranteed that if Camera Camera had shown a photo of Merkury Innovations 3 piece filter kit I would not have ordered.Because I went abroad for a year in Asia within days of receiving my order it was basically impossible to complain or return the item."
3,Fair,"I bought it just for protect the lens, but filter is not really work. Not a professional type. Hoya is much better."
3,It's important but not well written.,"My name is John and I'm a history addict. It is probably never a good idea to say, ""This is the most ......... of the century"" but I'll say it anyway. This relationship, Churchill and Roosevelt, was the most important relationship of the 20th century. Only my interest in history kept me going until the end. The subject matter is critical for an understanding of WW II but unfortunately the pace of the book is slow and at times a little disjointed. I had the same problem with ""A Man Called Intrepid"" but that too is an important book for an understanding of WW II. I would recommend both books for their history but not for their style."
5,Morris brings Berlin to life,"Joan Morris is a mezzo-soprano who has recorded a number of albums accompanied by her husband, composer and pianist William Bolcom. She has a lovely voice, and sings the old Tin Pan Alley and similar genre songs straight in the way they were written, without a lot of jazz embellishment. (Not that jazz embellishment is bad, it just doesn't always work with this material.) I'm a big fan of hers, so my opinions may be a little biased; but if you love this music it's hard to not enjoy Morris singing it.This is one of two albums devoted to Irving Berlin.* While others may have written more sophisticated tunes or more profound lyrics, no one matched Berlin in term of just plain good, rousing , songs. And Morris is with him all the way. Great stuff to listen to around a holiday!*Girl on the Magazine Cover: Songs of Berlin"
2,Doesn't cover scuff mark on my dashboard..,Be careful not to lay the bottles down or else will spill...when you open the bottle cover it doesn't have a plastic stopper to control the flow of liquid...
3,I wear this to the gym...,"They fail to mention that there's a light blue picture of a giant high-heeled shoe on the back of the shirt...not in the middle, but towards the upper left. Still, I love the quote and the reactions I get. :)"
4,Call of Duty strategy is very good!,"A well laid out book, explaining most that is needed.Would benefit by having all the keyboard basics in there as well.But is very very good for understanding the basics of the strategy."
3,An average read,"Since the back cover description is already included on this page, I'll skip straight to my review.Though this book is part of a series, it stands perfectly well on its own (I never read any of the other books in the Bride's Bay series and I was not at all confused reading this book).This book, which is in the Supperromance line, read more like an Intrigue novel. Which is fine if you like that, but I'm not much of a fan of the Intrigue line. I read romance for romance, and I find the intrigues focus more on the mystery than on the romance.That being said, the mystery and suspense was very well executed in this book, but the romance aspect of it left a lot to be desired. But the plot twist in the middle was so unexpected that it kept me reading, and the conclusion of this book was exciting.While not a keeper, this was enjoyable for a one-time read. If you're a fan of the Intrigue line, then you'll probably like this. If you're not, then you may or may not like it."
2,"Very adhesive, not very durable or cohesive, March 16, 2009","I have used dozens of brands of pad electrodes for TENS. These are the stickiest I have encountered, staying stuck in situations others would fall off. That is, sadly, their only saving grace. The adhesive tends to pull off in small sticky gobs during removal and cleaning. The leads are held in place very poorly, ripping completely out of the pads in some instances."
5,A Good Curling Iron for Overseas Travel,I bought this product because I needed a dual voltage curling iron to use overseas. It worked great! The cord is nice & long and it was the first time I'd used a ceramic curling iron and I loved it.
4,It is 4 stars for the midia...,"... Not to Sagan. He is, as always brilliant and enthusiastic about science and our place in the cosmos, but the midia... well, the first observation on almost every article is about ""his looks"", for me, it is emblematic of the image obsession of the general midia: first the appearance, then the caracther. Most of the time, in the interviews, you almost can see the interviewer hardly listening to Prof. Sagan, as if looking at the clock and sometimes (lots of times) cuting his speak short, it is announcers time!But you can't help getting a glimpse of this great man, shinning through the midiatic maze, if it is your first reading on Carl Sagan, buy others, this is it, just a glimpse, he is worth every word."
2,Waste of time and money,"i had worked in a restaurant for sometime and i wanted a Chef knife at home. This had the lowest price in Amazon.com. i bought one and i regret it now. it is not as sharp as the manufacturers claim it to be. if you plan to cut vegetables(esp greens) with this knife, you will have the hardest time in your life. please do not even think of buying this knife just for its cheap price. for a few extra dollars you will earn 5-10mins extra cooking time and lesser kitchen-rage(with knife in-hand!!) with a better knife."
4,"A great gift to someone unable to visit a nearby museum to see first hand, paintings by these two important artists.","Gave it as a gift to a High School girl. She is interested in art...she loves it!I think it is well presented, and the interviews show both painters were influenced by one another---an important communication, and respect!"
4,Intriguing story,"""Birthright"" is a good mystery: well-written, lots of suspense, and good characterization. I never lost interest, and the plot was not contrived. I really liked the Civil War as background; the time period added to the story's meaning. I highly recommend this book."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book in response to the other customer reviews, which raved. I'm sorry, but I certainly cannot agree with the other reviewers. This book is not well-written, is historically inaccurate, and is dull to me (and I'm a War Between the States buff!!)."
3,Now very out of date,"This is the original program guide, written while the series was still in production. Some small errors, and only good up to the 20th season. I bought mine almost new, so rereading fills me with bitter nostalgia, knowing that the show had only a few years to go."
3,Mediocrity At Its Best,"Not that its a bad CD. But this one does not distinguish itself in any fashion from the rest of the field. One can hear pretty much the same arrangements, rhythyms, and vocals from countless other wannabee latin artists and herein lies its fault.If you want to listen to adventuresome latin rhythyms look elsewhere. But if you just want to listen to background music while trimming your toenails, this will do just fine."
4,to whom it may concern...,"this is definitely one of those albums that you really have to have a taste for. quite different from their older more punk rock sounding album Spudgun (self titled) (i think). anyways, it is more of a mix between crust, hardcore, and ""some"" punk influences. the lyrics are totally for God. you rarely to never see lyrics like these. a total must have though if you are a fan of their old band. and also a fan of crust/hardcore/punk. i love this band. and their heart. or, at least, what it was. since, they are no longer around. peace out"
5,un viaggio al centro dei nostri tempi,"Tondelli descrive, con la forza evocativa delle sue parole, un viaggio al centro del nostro tempo. In Leo ritroviamo l'egoismo e la generosità, la ricerca del divino e il compiacimento nel degrado morale, lo slancio verso la frenesia delle metropoli e l'ansia di ritrovare le proprie radici culturali nelle tradizioni della campagna emiliana. Parlando di se, Tondelli parla di noi, di quanto sia faticoso assecondare ogni giorno la mutevole direzione dei nostri desideri e della nostra missione."
5,Worth it,"If you guys think about it, the book only costs 16 dollars.... and the wealth of knowledge inside this book is imcomparable to the book's price. On the other hand most people that have been racing for a couple years already know everything thats in the book. Overall it is well written and gives beginning racers the knowledge they need to be competitive. Did i forget to mention that the book is new? that means it has all the newest parts! thats why i gave it 5 stars; its current, well written, and informative"
2,Too high level - not enough detail,"This book's description and title gives the impression that there are detailed procedures illustrated in the book however it is VERY high level with no detail whatsoever. If you're only looking for mod ideas, this book is fine but if you're wanting down and dirty details, go elsewhere."
2,Doesn't say how to tune or modify,"This book is more like ""what you can do to tune or modify your 5.0L""This book doesn't explain things like adjusting timing, modifying EEC programming parameters, etc. Instead this book explains that you can buy a new set of heads, or intake manifold, or cam, roller rockers. etc. Doesn't tell you how to do the work or give tips on getting the most from these upgrades, just says you can buy the stuff and install it.The book explains nothing to you on how to do it."
2,Superhero meets super disappointment,"One word describes my feelings after playing the first level: 'Uninstall'Cons:Graphics, gameplay (unless you like the waddling grunts and mindless smashing), control."
2,Borring,the game is really cool at first. it gets repetitive fast. by the second level you will be bored DONT BUY IT
2,Gets old fast,"I rented the hulk with my game pass from blockbuster because I heard it was grest but I ended up returning it within 2 hours to rent a new game but by the fourth level I got bored of it. The levels with Bruce Banner take no skill and are boring. The levels when you are the hulk are fun in the beginning of the game but all you do is beat people up which gets old fast because he has no special moves. Easy and medium are way to easy and hard is imposible. Do not waste money on this game even to rent it, just borrow it from a friend."
4,Much Better Then Wolverine's Revenge,"This game was pretty good. It doesn't really seem to follow the storyline of the movie, but it is a decent game. What makes this game a little more exciting then just running around as the Hulk is that you also play as Bruce Banner in certain levels, which requires stealth. The fights are pretty nice, because instead of just fighting General Ryker's soldiers and guards all the time, in certain levels they challenge you with the Leader's mutant army, or some robots. Most of the sorroundings are completely interactive, such as in one level you can smash the wall to break off some pipes that you can use as weapons. The fact that you can use the enviorment as your weapons is great, and you can pull of certain combos as well. The boss battles are pretty fun, and in fights against characters like Madman, Flux and Ravage you can pull of special grapple moves. The game is ultimately fun and is a great improvement over Wolverine's Revenge."
2,Not bad,"The best part was some of the ""Extra"" challenges in this game. The rest of the game unfortunately was awful.The cutscenes and some of the gameplay graphics aren't all that great. Some of the story missions can be fun, but for the most part kind of boring or way too hard. And in the case with the Bruce missions, just down-right annoying.I wouldn't recommend this game at all. In fact, there's another Hulk game out there that really lives up to what a Hulk game should be, and it's NOT based on the recent movie: ""Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction."" Almost fully destructive environments, more unlockable Hulk abilities, and not only that but it's fun to play. Just roam around destroying things and increasing your abilities/combos."
4,A pretty good game.....Short though,I liked this game knowing that it is a direct sequal to the movie. I thought it was pretty good and the cinematics were awesome!The stealth missions were laughably easy. But the graphics were great.The parts were you turn into the hulk are great......Rend this game for fun but dont buy it. Its really short.I hope the PUNISHER game will be good.This game could have bin better. But they ruined by making this game so fast and making it just in time so they can have it in stores by the time the movie is out. Oh well lets hope 2 will be good.
2,"Slow and bad, but a bit fun","This game honestly sucked like the movie, if you liked the movie then buy this but the graphics is bad and the gameplay is fake."
1,"rent it or buy it used...better yet, don't play it at all","Don't waste much money or time on The Hulk for PS2--you'll regret it if you do. Sure, it looks pretty good, and you get to beat people up, but that's about it. Did I mention there is a lot of brainless fighting? You run around as the Hulk (sometimes as Bruce Banner) while hordes of haz-mat looking dudes run up and try to jack you. So you get mad and start throwing them around, punching them, etc. This happens over and over, to ""infinity and beyond"". Skip this one, it blows."
2,repeatative and boring,"everyone was raving about this game, but I should have heeded the advice of one review in particular. Don't buy it - rent it. I bought it - silly me. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!.Yeah so HULK SMASH. Sure it's fun enough, but save your money - half life 2 is coming soon.After level 2 it just wasn't fun anymore."
2,Hulk Smash!,"This game gets boring fast. Most of the levels involve you as the hulk chasing after somebody, trying to dodge and fend off the hordes of military soldiers firing at you. The ""special moves"" aren't impressive. The stealth missions as Bruce Banner are awful and the little puzzles you have to complete to open doors don't make sense in this game. It's fun to play if you like the hulk, but overall the replay value is low."
3,Meh,"It's an OK game, but kind of frustrating to control and boring at times. Great if you like the Hulk since it uses a lot of the background stories."
5,HULK=100% DESTRUCTION!!!,"The HULK is gonna be an awesome game!!!! I'm a big fan of the Marvel Comics and the HULK is one of my most favorite characters!!!!! Here's why, he's cool for one thing, but mostly because he can lift or press 100 tons, posesses a high degree of resistence to injury, pain, and diesease, immune to all terrestrial diesease, his skin is capable of withstanding great heat without blistering, great cold without freezing, and great impacts without rupturing, he can leap 300 ft. and cover 3 miles in a single bound, he can mentally locate where he became the HULK, and he has over 800 lb. of bone, marrow, and tissue. Now if I ran into this enormous, powerful, man-like creature, this is what I would do.....RUNNNNNNN!!!!!"
5,Great set of clippers!,This is a complete set of toenail and fingernail clippers. They are very strong and sturdy. I am very pleased with the quality. The case is very nice and easy to use. The clippers stay in place and do not fall out.
3,Manicure Set?,Should have been titled Pedicure & Manicure Kit...many more pedicure tools than manicure. Great tools just much more pedicure tools than needed and not as many manicure tools as expected!
3,they are good could been better,i bought this kit thinking more of pedicure some reviews said it had many pedicure tools i was very dissapointed with the pedicure instruments it does not have a tool that can reduce the toe nail and the only set of big pliers is not functional at all it has a hook on the back and it doesnt help when you try to cut your nails the small scissors are fine for your hands and feet but it definetely needs a couple of more things for the pedicure if you are more interested in the manicure i think it will be ok
2,Too dark and dreary,"I haven't seen as many versions as others here, but I really didn't care for this one. It was dark and dreary and the sound of the wind, at times, nearly overtook the dialog to the point that I missed some of what was said. I realize they were trying to portray the mood, but watching this was almost uncomfortable. I'll look at some of the other versions available but this DVD will most likely just gather dust on the shelf."
2,The Book Was Better,"Not a bad rendition of the story on film, but nothing special. It did tell the entire story from beginning to end and I give it credit for that. Somehow, the characters were as listless as the black and white DVD. In my opinion, there are better versions of this story on DVD including the one with Timothy Dalton and Anne Calder-Marshall. It was disappointing to see Ian McShane in such a lackluster performance as he is a much better actor."
2,Wuthering Heights,"This was almost unbearable to watch with Ian McShane as Heathcliff, and I did not like it. It's very long, and follows the book closely, but Heathcliff did NOT slit his wrists in the end as this movie portrayed. The earlier one with Olivier and Oberon was shorter, but better, and I liked Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff as well - even Ralph Fiennes was most believable. But, McShane became more like a gorilla than a man toward the end, or would make an excellent Wolfman."
1,I'm at a loss for words...,"Having never read the book, I picked up this movie off a shelf at the public library. I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. I've never seen anything like it. I thought the acting was terrible. I thought the constant wind sounds were terrible, and I thought the film making in general was terrible. Example: You go from a scene which was winter and then to transition to spring all of a sudden you're looking at the moors and there's a lamb standing there. That disappears and you're back to the story. All this dysfunctional family does is scream at each other and hate each other. It seems like everyone is cruel to each other. The doctor who delivers Frances' baby is heartless. I was so horrified while watching this, I couldn't NOT watch. I had to see if it could get any worse. I don't know - in a strange way, I'm so intrigued by this production, that I might just have to get the book to compare!"
5,Happy with product,"Received the item as described, the CD was in good shape and so was the manual. I had an old Microsoft Picture it, 2001, so I wanted to upgrade a little. The Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 has more selections in the software them my old one and I didn't have to spend a-lot of money for a new one.Happy with the seller and I received the item in a short time."
3,Save your money,"While I will say that this is a handy, easy to use program, it's not worth buying. Why, you ask? Cuz you can get it for free. I was using ""Microsoft Digital Image Starter Edition,"" and after 30 days or so, the free trial ended and many of the functions were disabled. The program's still available from Microsoft's site, but you can no longer purchase and unlock it, so I bought this version... and was disgusted to discover it's a downgrade.All of the functions that are usable past the trial on the ""Starter Edition"" are available here. However, NOT ONE of the great functions that were disabled after the trial (clone brush, exposure/color settings, eraser, red eye removal, paint brush, etc.) are available in this software.Not a bad program, but having used a better version for a trial period, it leaves a lot to be desired."
1,"Poor quality rehash of old clips, movie previews","I own dozens of Beatles videos and this sounded like it might offer something new, but alas, it failed miserably. The footage is recycled bits from already available video, and the quality is HORRIBLE - fuzzy, color washed out, hard to watch. Obivously this was made from a copy of a copy of a copy.... The only clear footage is some uninteresting scenes from an early 1990's Beatlefest, with a couple of boring interviews with attendees and very amateurish shots of items for sale. In between are poor quality trailers from the Beatles solo movie projects. Even if you don't own a single Beatles documentary video, DON'T get this one!!! Better choices are, of course, the Beatles Anthology, plus The First U.S. Visit, Fun with the Fab Four, The Beatles Unauthorized, and Imagine (John Lennon) to name a few."
1,Not worth it unless...,"Unless you are teaching someone from another planet about the Beatles, this ""documentary"" isn't worth much to real fans. It's so basic. I found myslef fast forwarding. Save your money and get a real Beatles biography like the Anthology or The Compleat Beatles."
4,"Enjoyable read, interesting characters","I found this book very enjoyable. It is a murder mystery where the prime suspect looks good for the crime but so do all the people around him. The PI investigating the case is a flawed ex-FBI agent down on his luck. I hope this author takes a deeper look into the back story of Colton Parker in future books, because his troubled childhood, career and marriage would be worth reading as well."
5,Essential Reading for Missions Students,"This is a graduate-level missiology text. Lingenfelter offers some important theoretical insights into cross-cultural ministry. The ideas help the missionary to think critically about several areas of the target culture: social order; property; labor and productivity; generosity and exchange; authority and family; authority and community; disputes, conflicts, and communication; and transforming culture. This is important reading for missionaries; if you are in a graduate missions program, this will likely be a text for your worldview course."
4,A Fun Name Book to Read!,"The Beyond Jennifer and Jason name books are fun name books to read. Yes the lack of meanings can be a little frustrating but there are so many fun catagories in the name book and I have found some names that I like and I found out that I don't care for what they call feminissima names. Don't get me wrong, the names in the femminissima catagory are beautiful names, it's just that after reading this book I discovered that I prefer plainer less fancy names and I also discovered that I like old fashioned classics and also some more unusual names and I recommend these name books to anyone looking for a name book that is fun to read though if you also want meanings of names you may want to buy another book but I would still recommend buying this one too!"
4,Nice change from the norm,"Bought this to get something different. It gave some interesting background and sorted names by categories rather than alphabetically like other books, which was a nice approach since we could see names that were similar to ones we liked."
2,Not as good as others,"I am an avid Amazon shopper, and I was disappointed with this book. It's just pages of a bunch of lists of names. A lot of names are repeated in different categories. I would recommend the book, Baby Name Wizard."
2,Eh... It was ok,"It's not a bad book but it wasn't really what I was looking for. I was hoping for more names, and less detail about the names. But if your looking for a crazy amount of detail... this is the book."
3,Beyond....,I did not find this book to be very helpful. It was poorly organized & did not give name meanings. It could have been much better & more useful.
2,"Same names, different lists","This book has many of the same names, listed again and again in different lists. I was looking for a book that had more of a dictionary style, without all the chit chat. This book was a waste of money, in my opinion."
3,This book is fun to look at,"but it wasn't really helpful to us in picking a name. It has a lot of strange catagories and everything is broken down in a list. There are no meanings of names. There are certainlly some very Unique names like Twilabelle, which were a little to unique for us."
3,Buy it ONLY if you do NOT have a previous addition.,"I had a child two years ago and had the previous addition to this book, which I found invaluable. I was thrilled to see a new book for the new millenium, however the ideas for the ""next millenium"" baby naming is outradgously stupid, telling you to basically ""pick words out of the dictionary"". The rest of the book is basically the same as the previous addtuion. Buy it ONLY if you do not have a previous addtion and skip the first section (unless you just want a good laugh)."
2,Not the best,Not very helpful. Would have liked more names and meanings rather than lists of names by type. Some food for thought though.
5,Helps you find the right name for your baby,"I have had several editions of this book and they have all been great. In fact this is the second time I have bought this edition because I keep loaning them to friends. This book has a different format from most baby name books in that it arranges the names in lists that give information about style, popularity (including which ones are ""so far in they're out""!), and other helpful categories. Reading this book helped me come up with ideas when I was having difficulty, and gave me the courage to choose a less common name for my daughter. I highly recommend this book to any expectant parents."
2,Overrated and not very useful,"I have had a difficult time selecting which baby name books to buy as they all seem very similar. I selected ""Beyond Jennifer & Jason"" because it seemed to stand out from the crowd of Lansky, etc. I was about halfway through when I realized that the author was just listing the same names over and over again. She came up with different types of lists but inserted names she had used for previous lists. This book is a waste of time and money and was not at all helpful to me. I probably would have been better off sorting through a baby name ""dictionary"" type of book."
2,Boring.......,"The names in this book are boring and really quite ridiculous. We didn't like any of the names in this book.I wouldn't recommend it. If you want to look through it, go to Barnes and Noble and browse. Not worth the $$."
1,Do Not Recommend,"Although the book contains several names, it does not provide definitions as it leads you to believe. Some names contain the origin, but they are the ones that are obvious. Also, the format of the book is confusing for the reader. It simply is not a good buy. I will be purchasing another book for the detailed data I thought I was getting in this book."
2,I didn't find this book helpful at all.,"I am returning this book. I needed a book that gives lists of names, not lengthy explanation about cultural choices for names. If you are searching for a name and just want information on names, origins, meanings, etc. this is not it. Interesting information but too much to read for someone expecting a child soon!"
4,Name Trends 101,"This book is a wonderful way to get an idea of what's going on, at the moment, in names. It's certainly not for those seeking accurate meanings, but it's still a good book to have if you want to know what's hot and what's not."
5,Klingons they way they were meant to be.,There is little I can add to Allyn's excellent review of Diplomatic Implausibility. Character development was what the book was really all about and the story served that purpose well. It was a pleasure to see Worf being independent and in charge. Like Allyn I look forward to seeing the Gorkon crew again. I highly recommend this book to anyone liking Star Trek
4,"Great book, despite the god-awful cover....","Ignore the cheesy as hell cover, this is a pretty damn good book. I love books that are smartly written, and have tension and conflicts between governments. Good stuff."
1,THIS TOILET IS BLACK!!!,"VERY GOOD TOILET, BUT PLEASE NOTE, THIS ITEM IN OFF-WHITE IS OUT OF STOCK. WE WILL RECEIVE A BLACK TOILET. THE SELLER DON'T WANT TO MAKE RETURNS FOR THIS!!!"
5,Jolie's Surrender,"I loved this book. I was impressed with Jolie's strength and the way she goton with her life despite the fact she lost Alvin when he broke up with her.Jolie had a lot of stress and trauma to deal with at a young andimpressionable age. She seemed to have had some issues with trust butresolved those issues. I particularly like the fact that Jolie wasnon-judgemental towards her young brother and was so supportive of him andhis girlfriend. Alvin is a guy who despite the macho world of professionalsports, showed a wonderful sensitive side towards everyone. Youngsters,friends and family alike. A number of the problems Jolie and Alvin facedcame from outside forces, out of their control, but despite these, bothended together happily ever after. A great plus for readers who lovebasketball as well as a terrific romance story!"
5,I want more of Jolie's rolling thunder!,"I read Jolie's Surrender from end to end in two days. It's a real page turner. I'm a male reviewer. This novel has a great collection of real life value nuggets sprinkled throughout it. The love scenes are hot (WARNING: blazin' hot). The passion was thunderous in the love scene after Jolie's near-death experience (whew...where's the fan!). The story also reinforces the differences between the female and male species. Alvin (lead fella) had to work damn hard to solve the complex Jolie-equation. It shouldn't have to be that hard ladies! Alvin's prize, however, was well worth the wait. My judge of a good book are the ones that keep me thinking about the chapters long after I'm done -- I am still thinking about Jolie's Surrender one week later. A very good read from Edwina Martin-Arnold. I'm buying Eve's Prescription now!"
1,Where are the clues?,"In this Nancy Drew book Nancy is the detective along with her friends George and Bess. A mystery develops as the team is researching a class project on ice cream. While the girls are doing the research they discover that someone is trying to sabotage the towns new ice cream shop, the Double Dip. The story is told from Nancy's point of view, she does not tell the reader about the clues that she discovers during the mystery. This book did not give the reader the feeling of suspense, there were no cliffhangers or motivation to continue reading. Each chapter ends with a dull ordeal that is solved in the first few sentences of the following chapter. There are better choices for a mystery available."
4,No recipe index ruins a great book,"I can't add anything to the effusive praise in other reviews. We use this daily and anyone on fat flush plan must have it. But the lack of an index for recipe titles and ingredients--something found in every other cookbook published on earth--makes it impossible to be creative. You can't look in the fridge, see what's getting old, and flip through the index. Since for many fat flush folks this is the only functional cookbook, that would be a big plus and you have to wonder why it was left out."
2,Disappointing,"I've been following the FF on and off for a couple of years and think it's an excellent diet overall. I observe the phase 3 principles as much as possible even when not on the program. However, the cookbook is a disappointment- the recipes are not particularly imaginative, and there seem to be more recipes for phase 3 than the other (more challenging) phases. The recipes are not culturally diverse, which is a shame given how limiting the diet can feel. I need far more variety in spicing to keep my palate interested. I've found the internet a much better resource for interesting/exotic FF friendly recipes."
4,Good supplement to the Fat flush plan,This was very good for providing more ideas and information for the fat flush plan. There were just a few recipes that are repeated from the fat flush plan book but still has lots of great recipes for all phases.
2,The Fat Flush CookBook,"Book was OK. Written for everyone, house people, career people, etc. Different occupations require different time allowances."
2,"Loved the diet, but HATED the cookbook","Let me start by saying that the diet works. I lost 40 lbs over three years ago, I feel great and I look great. The cookbook is one of the worst cookbooks I have ever bought. A few of the recipes are good, but most were dreadful. Titles like ""Cauliflower and Peas in Yogurt"" and ""Brussel Sprouts With Curry"" are about as tasty as they sound. It's the only cookbook I have used where I have baked an entire dinner only to throw it away. It's happened a few times, so now I don't use this book. Look elsewhere for good, low glycemic-index recipes using non-processed food and flax oil...."
1,Not a very sane idea.,It was to dramatic for someone with diabetics and high blood pressure . Some of the ingredients needed I wouldn't know where to find them. Also I cannot stomach the idea of eating the same thing for any meal every day of the week. I have tried this other book by another author where the food needed can be found in my small town grocery store. May I also add that I lost weight using it without really trying .
4,"Rarities interesting, rest has been seen before","The promotional videos from ""Totally Hot"" are fun to watch, especially if you're a fan of ONJ circa 1978-79. In my opinion this is when she looked her best - and she definitely is totally hot in the album cover photo session. Even though she's trying to look sexy, and does, the warmth of her personality is still evident. Unfortunately, the rest of the DVD is from the ""Physical"" video collection and the 1982 concert, both of which have been available on VHS for years (and the concert clips look like they were transferred directly *from* the VHS version, no digital enhancement, no nothing!) Video Gold 2 is definitely better as it contains more rarities, even if the majority of the songs are post-prime ONJ - although _Soul Kiss_ still sounds great."
4,Thank you Olivia!!!!,"I, for one, am estatic about this dvd collection. I have been a fan of Olivia Newton John for decades and it is so good to finally have all her videos together on DVD. My personal favorites are Stranger's Touch, The Rumour, and Livin' in Desperate Times. If you are a true Livvy fan you have got to pick up these dvds. They sound and look great.."
4,Olivia Newton-John - Video Gold 1,Not a big fan of the last few live videos but the rest of them make this DVD a worthwhile purchase.
3,"Overall, a good collection of videos and concert performances","Olivia Newton-John Video Gold I, is overall, a good collection of videos and concert performances.The DVD starts off, with what seems to be promotional videos from her Totally Hot album. The rest of the DVD is a mixed bag of videos and ""staged,"" live performances from the video collection, Physical. These are not very interesting, yet the band keeps things lively enough.Carried Away, is a good song, yet the video plays like an exercise video. The videos for Falling and Silvery Rain are very good. Silvery Rain is an interesting video, yet the song isn't one of her strongest.I was disappointed in the video for, Hopelessly Devoted To You. I would have preferred a live performance of the song instead of the video.The selections included from, Olivia In Concert, are OK, yet it may have been better to add more content from the concert."
2,"Great songs, horrible videos","Don't get me wrong, ONJ has some great songs, but the videos that are included on this collection lack any sort of creativity. The first two are shot to look like they are in the recording studio with her as she records the songs, you also see shots of the photo session for the ""Totally Hot"" album. After that the videos are mostly pulled from the ""Physical"" video album, in which cuts from that album were lip synched in a night club setting. The conceptual video for ""Physical"" is included, but that has never been a favorite of mine, song or video. I realize these songs go back to the early days of video, but there were some very cool videos coming out back then. The songs are great, the videos are just very boring."
2,Sharp Toner Cartridge,"Item was advertised as New but was received refurbished. Seller said item was ""wrongly displayed on Amazon website as a genuine product""."
3,Pop Vs Raga,"TANA MANA sounds more like an attempt to ""westernize"" Indian music than the traditional Shankar sound.Gone are the extended ragas, replaced by 3-minute, uptempo tunes. Gone are the tabla-sitar exchanges, replaced by synthesizer coloring.That doesn't mean this is bad stuff. In fact, most of it is very good. This might be the perfect album to introduce western ears to eastern music. ""Chase,"" ""Village Dance,"" ""Friar Park,"" and ""Reunion"" are stand out tracks."
4,Enjoyable,"This is a very enjoyable CD. This would be a great addition to anyone's Shankar collection or a good starter CD for someone not familiar with his music. For the more adventureous check out the Ravi Shankar - Phillip Glass CD ""Passages"" another excellent CD by two brilliant musicians.Passages"
4,Interesting Read,"I had to purchase this book for a freshman level political science course. It was the most interesting reading in the course, compared to the relatively dull and simplistic 'We the People.' The book is divided into debates over hot political issues and does a pretty nice job of representing multiple viewpoints for the sake of argument."
5,Excellent Buy,The book came very quickly and in the condition that was advertised! I was very pleased! I hope to buy from you in the future!Thanks!
3,Buy the game on the other consoles not on GBA.,"This isn't that great of a game. It only has 21 levels and there's nothing to unlock. Buy The Hulk for Game Cube, PC, Playstation 2, and X-Box instead of for GBA."
4,cool,This game is cool but verry hard!! You have to fight your way to distroy a genarator and then find your way back! It can be hard at times! the fighting is simple nothing real cool hear. over all a cool game.P.S.the game saves by itself (i was playing for hours wating for a save game pont!)
5,Lexar 1GB JumpDrive Mercury,"Because my work involves both the Mac and Windows platforms, I am quite pleased with the Lexar because it is easily recognized on either. I am very happy with the accuracy of the memory readout, too."
1,broken!,"After 1.5 months of moderate use, being carried around in a backpack pocket, the part that sticks in the computer totally broke off today. Unrepairable unless we wanted to get someone to extract the info from the memory stick. That piece had seemed slanted for a few weeks now, and you already had to jiggle it to get it to work.I've had the 256MB ""Sport"" Lexar (red, with a black rubber thing around it) for about 2 years now and frequently carry it around on my keys. I'd recommend THAT one (comes in larger sizes now), but not this one. No cap to lose, and hey, it hasn't broken!Buy another jump drive if you plan to carry it anywhere. NOT this one!"
1,Junk,"This is crap, waste of money and a sorry excuse from Emperor members. Sominum is stupid boring classical music."
3,"Victor Mature, the original ""pec man""","I saw this movie when I was about 6 or so. I could not decide between Mr. Mature, Howard Keel or Robert Taylor who was my favorite. All tall, dark and handsome, all pretty much bad or ""hammy"" actors. When Victor fought the lion with his bare hands and brought the columns down, I was enthralled. Hedy Lamarr as Delilah was the first female villain I remember in the movies except for the Wicket Witch in Oz."
2,Where's the meat?,"The book's hypothesis is a good one and Anthony may be on to something here, but he never quite delivers on how exactly to go about it, which is retire when you want to but keep on working on your own terms. The answer, of course, is the same as other retirement books dish out. Have a fat portfolio. It is really another investment planning book in a different guise, and, frankly a lot of the figures he uses are still based on the roaring bull market of the '90s and not the reality of today's market. It is a book pretty much directed at a target audience of the upper middle income baby boomer who wouldn't mind keeping on working after retirement because his work is not all that taxing to begin with. A policeman who has been walking a beat in Watts for 30 years or a Detroit assembly line auto worker would get a big chuckle out of this."
2,Not Riverside Drive or West End,"I'm now fairly addicted to van Wormer's books, but this just doesn't live up to her previous work. I was never that interested in Jessica, which may be the main reason Talk didn't make that big an impression on me. I know the author can weave a much finer story and I'm just waiting for something more and a continuation of Cassy and Alexandra's lives. Maybe, Expose will fit that bill. But Talk is okay."
2,"If you can get through the first 200 pages, it gets better","Laura is not a very strong writer, and her characters are annoying at best. However, the story does improve after the first 200 pages."
1,What a dissapointment!,"I've read all van wormer's other books and enjoyed them so i was suprised by how terrible this novel was. Most characters are flimsy, underdeveloped repeats from former novels, the plot is far-fetched as well as difficult to follow. It was really diffcult to sustain even the most minimal interest in the last fifty pages. A real dissapointment. Skip it."
5,Crawdaddy,"I purchased 2 of these and installed them on my flat standing seam metal roof. I used butyle rubber instead of silicone because it's stays pliable and doesn't dry out and shrink like silicone. These babies are almost constantly spinning with the smallest amount of breeze and has reduced heat and humidity in my attic space wherein is contained my daughter's bedroom also. The room is cooler in the summer but, amazingly, not colder in our very mild winters, Northern Bahamas. They do not leak and make no noise."
4,based on PS2 Version........,"Bought out of a bargain bin, I actually found a small treasure. Yeah the graphics for this game cannot compare to some others, but it more than makes up for that in gameplay and story. It is repetative at times, but you can't just go into every battle with guns blazing. There are times when you do have stop and plan a strategy.I love the real voice acting. It was fun trying to figure out where you heard those voices before. Also the rock music comes on a erfect times during gameplay and gives a whole new feeling to the action. If you ever get a chance, listen to ""Breaking Benjamin"" the band in the game.This is not one of the best action games out there, but it is definatelty above average and in my opinion worth the money."
2,**DO NOT BUY THIS GAME**,"Mediocre graphics, only 3 pre-set control schemes, overly long and boring cut scenes, terrible camera angles and really horrible game play. I only gave it two stars instead of just one because they somehow got Lance Henriksen and Kate Mulgrew (Millenium/Star Trek Voyager) to do character voices. I guess it's back to fighting ""The Flood"" again until ""Brute Force"" ships."
3,Growing Up Fatherless in the Fifties,"I commend Madeleine Blais for her effort to record her childhood experiences. She recalls her reaction to her father's untimely death and draws nicely described vignettes of her five siblings and their not-quite-able-to-cope mother. The scenes are linked with mentions of songs, current events and other minutiae of the 50s. Unfortunately these sound like they were gleaned from an almanac to serve as fillers.She has some pleasant moments in the book, and I was reading it just for that ""growing up in the 50s"" ambience. I grew up as one-of-six and was interested in her experience in a large family.There's nothing much wrong with the biography, but it just seems lacking somehow. The account lacks the elegance of language of Trevanian's The Crazy Ladies of Pearl Street while their middle class life lacks the drama quotient of The Glass Castle. Maybe if I hadn't read those first, I'd find Uphill Walkers more compelling."
3,Great game plan; okay execution,"Entertaining trip with an NBA team. Predictable with no twists or turns, but the authors kept it moving. A real fun read. If this is ""dead-on"" as Bill Walton says in the cover blurb, then the NBA life is just as good and bad (and as R-rated) as you imagine it to be. A couple minor irritations:- As another reviewer says, the authors use unnecessarily obscure words. Sample: ""... Kwaanzii would be ushered to center court, in mufti, and panegyrized by Padgett..."" This is in the same paragraph where they use the word ""redolent"".- The lingo and feel of the religious player is so thoroughly wrong that it makes you wonder what else is phony. Fortunately, this player's lines are few.All in all, I enjoyed the book. I wish there were more like it."
5,Great Satire of the NBA,"This was a really quick read that was funny cover to cover. It got the NBA satire down to a T. The bratty billionaire owners, the arrogant young players, the way Stern spins everything positive even though half the players are criminals. Some great specific jokes about A.C. Green, Doug Christie, and Stu Scott (names changed of course). It's also well-written and has compelling characters that make it a joy to read. I highly recommend this book to any NBA/sports fan, and even to readers with little interest in sports."
2,"Hard to get into, so I didn't","I bought this book because I love the NBA, covered it for a few years and enjoy reading even fictional accounts of it . As others have mentioned, this book starts off agonizingly slow, and never seemed to pick up for me. The word choice was also difficult to ignore. I think you'd be better off withMVP: A Novel. I read about a book or two a week, and this was one of a few that I simply stopped reading after about 50 pages."
5,A book even a non-sports fan woman can love!,"I picked up this book with trepidation, given its pro sports basis, on the recommendation of a friend. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a good story, well-written with a good page-turner quality to it. I recommend it without reservation."
5,The Persona of the Lonely Doll,"My mother had always read me the Lonely Doll books when I was a child, and I did the same with my kids; I was so excited to get the chance to see who Dare Wright really was and I actually bought the book for my mom, and then had the chance to read it myself. It is a crushingly real tale of such a tragic creature, Dare, but a wonderfully written book. I never expected the things I learned by reading this book, and for anyone who is a Lonely Doll fan, it really drives home the feelings behind Edith (the Lonely Doll), makes her even more real. Definitely not a book for children, though."
4,deeply moving,Dare Wright's book The Lonely Doll was one of my favorites as a child so when I saw this book I was mildly interested. Once I began reading it I could not put it down. Wright's emotional growth and life were stunted by a domineering mother. The book does not take the easy path by making Edie the complete villain and I think if Edie could've looked into the future and seen what was in store for her daughter she may well have done things differently. There was love but it was the smothering kind. By the time her mother died Dare Wright had no idea how to cope without her or how to live like an adult.The section on Wright's decline was incredibly disturbing and when I cried when I read it. But this is not a totally downbeat biography. It celebrates Dare Wright's work. It celebrates her career and those quicksilver years when it seemed that there was nothing she couldn't do. This is a well written biography about a remarkable subject.
2,"Interesting, but so are a lot of things","This book held my interest, was well organized and went into great detail. I felt as though Dare came across as snobby and conceited. I don't think this was the author's intent, but it was never explained why Dare wore such revealing and questionable clothing. She seemed obsessed with herself with so many photographs of herself (yes, the mother took many, but Dare herself took some). The book made mention that she did it without realizing, but I don't know how anyone could not realize. If someone was self conscious about a past or had sexual insecurities, then I don't understand why they would go out of their way to dress provocatively. I hope they don't make a movie about this. Yes, it is interesting, but it's no different than what is found in most of Hollywood."
1,Breaking The Lonely Doll,"Rather than illuminating the shadows in Dare Wright's life, this book plunges into uncorroborated conjecture and amateur psychoanalysis that only obscure Wright's true story. Joyce Carol Oates has called this literary form of character denigration a ""pathography"". The multi-talented Dare Wright, www.darewright.com, deserves much better."
1,Ghastly,"This biography of children's author Dare Wright is filled with inaccuracies and speculation. Poorly written, it does nothing to illuminate Ms Wright's fascinating life."
1,Not all that good,It seems to me that these women (Dare and her mother) had accomplished so much and were way ahead of their time. This book focuses mostly on the negative and alludes to things without much proof. What a waste of time. Who isn't a little eccentric among us. I think I would have enjoyed a book that focused on their accomplishments rather than one digging for dirt in their personal lives. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,another stupid Saddle Club book,There is less horse-related stuff than the description says. More typicial Saddle Club ... about snobs trying to look down on people. Don't waste your money--read the THOROUGHBRED SERIES instead of the SADDLE CLUB.
2,"Odd mistakes, so far","Well, I bought this book because I saw some promising baby patterns but, so far, I'm disappointed by the number of odd errors in the pattern I'm knitting. I'm making the cable sweater at the beginning of the boys section. First of all, the sizes are *way* off of usual baby sizes, which I didn't realize until I had gotten going on it. Then, the directions for the cable don't match the picture -- they're twisted the wrong direction and in a four row pattern, not six (and four looks better). Then, I noticed that there are no ribbing instructions for the end of the sleeve, and there is definitely ribbing in the picture. Fixable, but still. Why so many mistakes when this is a pattern reprinted from the magazine? It doesn't make me want to try the other patterns in the book, that's for sure."
5,50 Whimsical Projects for Babies and Toddlers,"Great selection. Patterns are well written, pictures accurate."
4,Not a toy in my opinion,I purchased this to help track my husband's busy travel schedule and other commitments. I stacked two on the side of our refrigerator. It has been handy so far.
4,Makes you want to go out and ride,"This book follows a professional rider who is relegated to the role of a domestique or supporting rider to other famous foreign riders over in Europe. In a short period of time his luck changes and we are taken along for the ride. This book will definitely appeal to any avid cyclist, endurance athlete or a person looking for insights into the requirements of professional cycling. The book does a great job showing the commitment, hard work, and perserverance required to achieve results in professional cycling. We get to know our main character and how he came to ride in the world's greatest bicycle race through flashbacks.In many ways, I am sure this fictional rider is a composite of many of the American riders who currently ride over in Europe.I really enjoyed this book and read it straight through in a single evening."
3,Good insights into the life of an American rider in Europe,"This is light reading, with only a modicum of character or plot development, but the story is enjoyable and the bike racing details a genuine kick for anyone who enjoys the sport. The sequal has a stonger story line and actually gets pretty intense. I'd recommend reading both, even if you've never raced. Some interest in the Tour is probably necessary!"
5,I'm exhausted!,"Wow! I just read The Race and I feel like I've ridden it myself. It's been years since I've ridden a bicycle and I've never watched one in person. I think I ought to change both those things. If you love a good story, whether you're in to cycling or not, READ THIS BOOK!"
5,The Race,"What a great, fast paced read. I read the book while on my stationary bike and I feel like I was apart of the race!! I gave the book to friends for birthdays and they loved the book and we all can't wait to watch The Tour this summer. We feel as if we visited the French countryside and we can't wait to return. I have heard that there is a sequel in the works. When will we get to return."
2,"Addictive, yet truly awful","What a conundrum this book is! From an adult's perspective, the style, plot and character development are simplistic, hackneyed and 'cheesey' in the extreme, more akin to what you'd expect in a pre- or early-teen novel. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the book is unbelievably addictive, and virtually impossible to put down; for that aspect, I give it an extra star. In summary: Junk food for the mind, of the finest/worst variety."
5,Excellent Book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced book, which has just the right amount of cycling mechanics and human interaction. By far one of the best cycling stories I've read. Mr. Shields draws you into the intricacies, passions, and rivalries of the Tour de France, as well as bringing back to life the thrills of youth tearing down a descent and the freedom of a bike. Whether you're a cyclist or not, you will enjoy this story of physical and mental struggles, and will likely identify with many of the dreams and disappointments of the main character, Ben Barnes. Tres bien!"
3,It was a fast read,"It had all the weaknesses pointed out by other reviewers, but I have to admit that I sat in the one-stall reading library so long that my legs went to sleep hooked on reading several chapters. It's a long way from great literature, but it does paint an interesting picture of the inside of the peloton. It ain't War and Peace, but that's a good thing. My legs weren't the only things that went to sleep trying to read that."
5,A Pedal Turner with a sprint finsh!!!,"WOW!!! I must say Dave knows how to get the reader to grip just a little harder. This is a page turner you won't be able to put down till he end. I wish this was a hardcover because I was pushing and pulling on the cover just like they were my handlebars. The book looks like it went through the wash or something. It's just a terrific book!!! I meet Dave in Dalton, Ga for the Tour de Georgia and told him how much I liked the book and that I'm waiting for the next one. Dave is a great writer."
2,Altec Seems to be Slipping,"I've had Altec speakers for less that were better than these. These are light weight, the wires are small gauge, and to make matters worse the volume control is on the sub! It's always weird to have to reach under my desk to change the volume."
4,A quick ease reference... and translator!!!,"This book provides not only the basics and some extras on the built-in Oracle utilities for regular expression handling, but also provides a nice ""translation manuscript"" if you are used to working with regular expressions in languages such as Perl, Java, C++, etc.Great little reference and especially useful for translating your regular expressions between engines."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a concise reference/tutorial for using regular expressions, especially for programming in .NET, and bought this without giving it a good overview. This isn't what I expected or wanted.This book reviews the use of regular expressions in SQL SELECT statements, apparently a new feature in Oracle SQL. It does go over a number of details about regex that will be useful, but I am having to wade through all the SQL stuff.The error is mine, but I thought I'd give a warning just in case someone else thinks of doing the same thing."
1,full of errors,This book is full of errors and inciendiary statements about the Koran and Islam. In short it is doing a dis-service to humanity!Instead of understanding it is furthering hatred among the people of this earth.
1,Shallow and biased,"This book is written with bias. If I didn't know many things already about Islam, I would have probably started to dislike a faith and a large part of our humanity, immensely. This book has combined true facts with biased hasty generalizations about muslims and wants to spoonfeed people who only see black and white. All humanity, All faith must coexist: winning a war against this, is an illusion that humanity does not believe in anymore. God Bless and spend your time making peace rather than starting hate and bias."
1,Secrets of the Koran,This is a dumb book and it dosent tell the truth about the muslims.This should not be put in public and should be wrote by somebody who knows alot about Islam not by Don Richardson who knows nothing but garbage.
5,Secrets of the Koran,Excellent information about a religion that plans to replace all religions. Detailed facts about Mohammad and his rise to power on the back of the Jews. Violence being at the center of this religion makes it different than any other I have investigated. Join them or die.
3,Big orange blob,"It was kind of startling to look at this big orange blob in a box. The whole family got a good laugh when we seen it. It is still in the freezer since Christmas. No one has the courage to eat it. I guess it is ""fun food""."
3,No data passthru,Item does as advertised and let's you charge from your PC. When your IPAD is connected using the adapter it is for charging only. No itunes or pc connection.
2,Not working for me,I tried it with both an iPhone 5 and iPad 3 and neither said it would charge from my CyberPower USB 2.0 7-port with/Power Adapter hub.
3,"does what I need, sort of","I've had a Boxwave USB AC/12V combo charger for years that's worked fine for my older iPod and other devices. When I got a 4G iPod touch I ran into the problem that I couldn't charge it using my old charger, which was simply ignored. It wasn't 100% clear if this device would solve the problem, but for the price figured it was worth a shot. And it works, sort of. Maybe 1/3 of the time I plug it in and it charges fine. Sometimes I plug it in and it says charging is not supported with this device, but it works if I unplug it and plug it back in. Then sometimes it charges for awhile, and at some point it stops and the iPod says the device is not supported. Once, after appearing to charge for awhile, I came back to discover it had proceeded to almost completely discharge the iTouch. So it's sort of useful to me, but not reliable, and I'll probably have to do what I was trying to avoid and buy yet another charger."
4,Works as advertised,The ProsCharges my IpadCharges my verizon MiFi 4510L via USB without issuesThe ConsSomewhat expensiveThe RelevantBought this originally because some devices are configured not to be charged off a regular USB adapter. This gets you around that limitation. It works fine on my IPad and MiFi and lets me charge on the go. Would have liked to see a 5-7 range for the price though.
4,Great Stars of the Broadway Musical,"Fans of the Broadway musical and costume design will love these paper dolls. The illustrations are wonderful.Among the highlights are Eve Arden, Elaine Stritch, Bernadette Peters and the gorgeous Diahann Carroll, as well as the costumes from ""The King and I"" and ""Evita"".I wasn't so sure about the likenesses of Lena Horne and Carol Burnett.I would have preferred it if the book had been chronologically divided into two volumes so that each star could have been outfitted with more outfits."
3,"Good Text, Slow Delivery","Galileo is classic. Reading it was like jumping into a world of old science. Sure, Galieo was wrong about a few things, but he was bold enough to take advantage of the printing press and stick to his guts. I would recommend this book for anyone interesting in science history or astronomy.The reason I only gave this book three stars is because it arrived so late. I needed it for class, and I actually had to buy another copy because this one didn't come in time. I mean, what am I supposed to do with two copies?"
4,a dramatic first hand account!,"I loved it. Galileo was a very opinionated man and he really shines through. I felt like I was looking through his telescope and seeing Jupiter, the sun, moon and Saturn for the first time."
1,Has To Be Used With Windows Moviemaker,I removed Windows Moviemaker years ago- now the Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 I bought on Amazon is useless- nobody said that Windows Moviemaker is required to use Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006.
1,Dont get this game,This game is just a run around as a green booger destructing stuff. I always rent a game b4 i buy just in case. I rented this game and its just running around smashing things. save your money or rent it first if u like it but i doubt anyone would like to play a booger on steroids.
4,Better than the movie,"Nice game, can get repetative though, great graphics, The parts where you are bruce banner arnt so hot though. You can pick thinks up, throw them at helicopters, destroy tanks, other mutants. The Game is the best thing to come out of the hulk craze"
3,"Hulk=Fun, Banner=Drag","I will admit, playing this game as the Hulk is pure fun. You get to smash nearly everything in your path. Puny humans are no match for the Hulk when he is really p.o'ed. BUT, you also have to play as Bruce Banner in stealth missions and he is just a drag. Sneaking around, whining and just being useless. It's irritating to say the least. If one little thing happens to him, he hulks out and it's back to the start of the level for you. Still, the game is better than I thought it would be and the levels you play as the Hulk make up for the whiney cry-baby Banner. I would suggest you rent it first to see if it's right for you."
4,Good change of pace game,"I was skeptical at first in buying this game. After playing for a few hours though, I found both functioning as Banner and as the Hulk interesting. As Banner, you're forced to sneak around to accomplish goals to move to the next level. It's not as easy as I would have thought, but atleast makes you think a little. Being the hulk is REALLY fun, as you get to smash virtually everything in sight. Bosses aren't impossible to defeat either, which makes it a little more fun than the average frustrating level game that requires 19 special moves to finish off a boss. The one drawback is the limitation of continues if you die (i.e. especially as Banner). You would think that game makers would get a clue from games like Halo. Unlimited continues good. Limited continues bad."
4,Awesome,"This game is so much funu can grab troops and throw them off cliffs, at helicopters, or other troopersi picked up this guy and threw him at some person with and electric sheild. He bounced off and was electricutedEven though playing banner is a little difficult u have to be stealthy and swift in order to complete the level.I personally liked being the hulk because it is like you cant die and u have the ability to crush everything.When they say what u can see u can smash, they mean it.u have a wide variety of weapons from yor fists, to pipes, to cars.This game rating on a 1-10 scale is a 20"
5,best u2 video ever,"nice video !!!! simply the best of u2.... nice quality images and sounds...recomendo à todos, inclusive os brasileiros !!!!! moro no brasil e sempre compro aqui...."
5,A great show that all should see.,"I didn't have the opportunity to see you U2 n the Zoo TV tour and never watched the tape version of the show. I enjoyed watching the DVD, the quality is great with a few twitches here and there but that OK. You really get to experience the show and how huge it was."
1,Stay away-VHS video quality,"Be aware this DVD looks and sounds like a bad, multi generational VHS copy. Audio mix is extremely poor with lots of distortion in the lower frequency's regardless of the audio track selected with DTS being the worse. But the biggest disappointment is the video quality, VERY soft with washed out colors. No way this was remastered from the original film. The video quality looks like a third generation VHS copy, its THAT bad. This show is U2 at their best with some of the best camera work and sound you will ever see in a live show so either wait for a re-relase or find a laser disc copy and have it transferred to DVD. I sold my laser disc copy when I saw the DVD release announcement but now will have to find another copy and make my own DVD. If you have never seen this show go for it, but if you archive music like I do, this disc has so many problems it is unwatchable more than once and doesn't even come close to a laser disc or original VHS tape.."
3,Great and Disappointing at the Same Time,"Short and sweetDie Hard Fan, seen them many many times. Was eager for this DVD to come out. Visually stunning, quality is amazing. Band was great, I saw this tour at Yankee Stadium. HOWEVER, the sound quality of the DVD, specifically Bono's audio was highly disappointing. Music is very loud compared to his voice and he is drowned out. Major disappoitment to me.Again though, visually, DVD is spot on. But overall, not what i had ultimately hoped for."
2,"Bad video, average sound","The concert itself is one of the best ever. But we have to wait years to have this DVD edition, so I expected much more about the sound (average, too bassy) and specially the video (very bad, seems like a bad VHS. And 4:3 aspect ratio)."
1,Vunder Boot,"For the bleeding hearts of Euro-romance in the mirco-tonic, teutonic, ironic age this is Vunderful! The big plastic bag of ideas that surround U2 is poked to release everybody's imaginary history -- even the band's own. Meaning: U2 has no idea of real ideas. It's rock and roll pretension on a slick stage with staged antics, rolled into one big Cheeseball hamming it up with a pre-packaged LOVE LOVE LOVE (hold the HIV cream) to hedonists everywhere. And a surly lot they are with wondrous wisdom to boot.OK kids, just remember they are rich and you would dodge paying taxes in Ireland too, if you had a just as refined social conscience."
4,Must have for all U2 fans!,"I remember the first time I saw this concert footage (on VHS) and thinking that surely it must rate as one of the greatest live shows ever - right up there with Peter Gabriel's ""Secret World Live"" (among many others). So I was very pleased when the U2 camp finally decided to release this monumental event on DVD.And this DVD is great! But it could be better.The main problem is the audio - Bono's vocals in particular. His vocals are too quiet in the overall mix. I had read that in another review before purchasing, and it's true. But that's my only complaint and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.This DVD captures a very special moment in time for one of the best rock bands in the world. They finally had the clout and the resources to put on a show like never before - a visual music experience that they had always dreamed of doing.And if you like U2, you will love Zoo TV."
5,U2 at their best!,"Well, I am an unconditional fan of U2. I am from Peru and when they came to South America last year I could't help going to Argentina to see them. I was in the Golden Circle and it was an experience that I will never forget. This DVD -although it is from the Zoo TV Tour- is just an approach to how amazing a U2 concert can be. A MUST for any U2 fan, old or new."
4,"Stunning concert, poor quality","The concert is excelent. But the picture and sound quality could be better. Much better, in fact. I think my VHS tape was not much worse."
4,The fun continues,"I am really enjoying this game.I never finished DS I, I thought it was tedious. DS II fixed the problems of DS I and I played the sequel through to the end. There wasn't anything about the gameplay compelling enough to make me want to go through it a second time for the extra charactor slot, but it was a REALLY enjoyable H&S; while it lasted.I haven't experienced any of the bugs the one reviewer did, my characters imported right away. I'm having fun well into the second act.If you enjoyed DS II, you should buy this."
3,Dungeon Siege Broken World,"This was a let down from the 1st part. I finished the 1st part at level 84 and found that Broken World was either to easy or hard. You need it to be right in the level or it was to easy or hard. Their was not an even leveling system in place which made the game un-fun or boring. Game play was very short for the money too!!!!! About a weeks play 3 hours a day or if you where not leveled correct just sucked!!!! Graphics excellent, interface very good and overall feel very good...."
3,Doesn't do well on Win 7 after level 40 ish,"This has a major issue with Win 7 after level 40. I've tried nearly all the tips, tricks and work arounds. I do have one, but is a major pain. You have to save the ""working copy"" character before exiting, then moving that ""working copy"" over the saved copy as it will reset otherwise."
4,Good service,"Exactly what I asked for, quickly shipped, in great condition. I in fact may have to buy another one of these for a friend so Ill be sure to come back here."
3,broken world,"this expansion is fun but very hard. if you're in for the long haul,you'll like it. i started at level 45 and by the end of part 2 it was real hard. i feel it's worth the ten bucks i paid for it. bush hog"
2,broken game,"I don't know about broken world; I would call it broken game. Its very frustrating that you can't import characters from DS2 in any meaningful way. I enjoyed DS2 a lot, and just wish that broken world worked as suggested by the documentation. There's no mention of patches on the official site."
1,Dungeon Siege 2: Broken World,"The game was extremely short. Even with the 2 new characters and weapon recipes, I did not think the game was worth anywhere near the money it cost."
5,Something about this band,"There's a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, Scott Radinsky, who is in this band. Cool."
4,DAMN GOOD CD,I REALLY LIKE THIS CD. I DON'T THINK IT IS WORTHY OF FIVE STARS BECAUSE EVERYONE KEPT ON TELLING ME HOW GOOD IT WAS SO WHEN I GOT IT I EXPECTED IT TO BE AS GOOD TEN FOOT POLE'S REV. IT IS STILL GOOD
4,Pulley's best.,"So far to date, this is Pulley's best album. A notable improvement over ""6o Cycle Hum"" ""working-class-whore"" and ""soberbean"" are great opening songs. Solid effort. Good good."
4,Resco lead,I like this lead. Feels sturdier than some for my medium sized dog but still fits nicely in my hand.
3,Leather cleaner watery,"The viscosity is like water. Softened the leather, but did not remove stains. Somewhat of a funky smell. I have used it twice which isn't adequate time for a thorough review."
5,Sobre Nocturne,Great album! This was my second copy and I would buy it again if I ever came across the need to do so.
1,baaad book,"Seriously, don't buy this book. She touts ""The 3 secrets"" that will ensure a great big ""O"" every time. I'll save you time and money and tell them to you here: here they are: Be on top, use a vibrator, and fantasize. Yep, that's it! This book makes heavy use of italics and bold print."
1,Don't bother to stop and smell the dasies on this one!,"This book is for someone COMPLETELY naive about anything sexual and is devoid of sexual common sense. It tells you the 3 basic ways that every woman knows already and if those things don't work or what you were trying to go beyond, you jipped out. It's not a sure thing ,and, le'ts face it, that's what we are looking for! So please keep walking past the dasies..."
1,Not impressed,This book was not at all beneficial to me. It mostly works on you pleasing yourself by yourself and not with a partner.
2,This is just for beginners,"If you are just now getting into the intimate part of your relationship and all this is new, this is the book for you. It offers good tips for the shy and beginners (virgins). For all others, read How To Be A Great Lover. The men I have talked to absolutely love this book. For those who know nothing about being a good lover for him, combine 5 Minutes To Orgasm, since you are a beginner, and How To Be A Great Lover, for his enjoyment.Perry Rose, author of I Love You...Will You Marry Me?! & Women, Sex And Dating, For The Single Man"
3,Good for You only,"This book is mostly about learning how to make YOURSELF have orgasms, and for women who don't know how, it is an excellent introduction..."
3,Not for Romantics,"This book is not for romantics. It's about the mechanics of having an orgasm during sex - if you are a woman who has been unable to reach that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. The technique is simple, concise and to the point. If you are looking for something that talks about mood setting and flowers, you are out of luck. Just practical down to earth advice."
1,Dissapointing,This book is not anything that is new. If your partner likes to please herself and you like to watch then this is a good book for you. We found it dissapointing and very unrevealing. We sent it back!
1,save your money,"I bought this book based on the other customer reviews, and I wasted my money. You are better off going to a library and reading magazine articles about making love and orgams. It's all the same information. If you want a long orgamsic history and want to know the 3 steps, which she takes forever to ""reveal"", then waste your money. But basically, do everything they always say, be on top, and add a few candles."
2,Read ANY other sex books? - Then don't bother with this one!,"If you're an avid reader of sexual ""self-help"" books, then this book will be a complete let down. Yes, it has some good basics, and yes, it's easy, quick reading, but if you're hoping it will provide some real enlightenment on how to reach more/better orgasms (as I was), then don't waste your time. The information is extremely topical and not worth the money. Personally, I recommend Graham Masterson's books - they're all great; full of useful information and interesting reading."
3,good but for specific problem,"I bought this and The Elusive Orgasm. This book has very good information for women who can orgasm by themselves but not during sex. If you have trouble orgasming at all then this won't be helpful, I recomend the Elusive Orgasm for these problems. The book is a really quick read (100 pages) and not by an expert, but has good information still. I think this book is good for the specific problem of not reaching orgasm fast enough during sex but not for any other problems."
2,Don't buy this,This didn't tell me anything I didn't already know from health class. Maybe i'm a sensitive guy. If you aren't maybe you'll get more than I did: feeling frustrated I shelled money out for this ...
3,"Women are NOT ""slow cookers""","My wife and I were fairly skeptical about this book when we ordered it. I've always read that men are like ""microwaves"" and women are ""slow cookers,"" like the author says, but this author puts that myth to rest. This book really lives up to its name. As a man, I'm glad to be relieved of responsibility for my wife's orgasm by following the instructions in this book."
3,An unusual premise,"For years, I have needed oral sex in order to have an orgasm, until my partner convinced me to try the formula in this book. This book takes the unusual point of view that it's often a woman's fault if she doesn't have an orgasm, and not her partner's responsibility. I resented this idea at first, but the author made her point. If it's my ""fault"" then it's also within my control. I tried her approach, and it worked after a couple of times when I got over feeling awkard. My partner says he's relieved."
1,Nothing New,"At first I thought the history of women's sexuality in this book was interesting, but once I read that the author recommends fantasies that include incest, I threw the book in the trash. She states that ""fantasies aren't sick; only hurtful behavior is sick."" In my opinion incest as a fantasy is sick no matter how you look at it. Other than that the book had nothhing new in it, stating that women should not depend on a man for pleasure and they should use vibrators, masturbation and pornography to please themselves during sex. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Waste,"I bought this as a instruction book after reading the reviews, but really it was only about helping woman feeling comfortable and relaxed about having sex and touching themselves. It was not insightful, but was a waste of money."
3,Good book,"I recommend this book if your having a problem in this area. although, it didnt work in five minutes like she says, it is very simple and informative."
3,Worked for Me,"The simple one-two-three technique worked for me, but be forewarned, not every woman will like this book. You have to be open-minded enough to take control of your sexual response."
1,Save your money,This rehash of 1960's pseudofeminist sex therapy is for libido-lost matrons who can't find their clitoris and their husbands who don't know what one is.
3,Good Gift,For years it has taken oral sex [...] for me to have an orgasm. This book really helped. I've started giving it at wedding showers. A too-slow orgasm seems to be a problem for a lot of us and most of my friends have been happy to get it.
1,Awful Book,"It's difficult to write a review of this book within the constraint of not ""spoiling"" the contents. Perhaps the best way would be to say that I have read numerous sex guides, and been involved in professional counselling, and this book offers rotten advice to those who would want a closer bond with their sexual partner. If sex means more to you than a quick fling, don't buy this book. In fact, don't buy this book no matter what."
2,Just get a cattle prod!,This book reads like an artificial insemination guide for farm animals. Pick up a cattle prod and a Farmer's Almanac for half the price!
1,the title says simple,"i just ordered this book and am waiting for it. i do take alot of time to read reviews on items that i buy. even down to the clothes i buy for my son. the thing is- the title simply has the word ""SIMPLE"" in it. thats the point. its not supposed to be all technical and using big words. i mean, face it, when u wanna get ur rocks off u dont wanna have to take ten years to do it.....5 minutes is sometimes all u need.ecspecially when u have kids lol. im going to read it and if i hate it i wont be disappointed at all. its all about how u use the information, good or bad, to better what u like."
2,Anti-Climatic,This is one woman's opinion of the best way to do it. It only took me one hour to read (with interruptions). Half of the book is the history of women and orgasms (completely unimportant information). I returned the book because it didn't suggest anything I haven't already tried. Definitely anti-climatic.
2,A Beginners Guide to Masturbation,"This book is designed for women who have never fully explored their own bodies and do not know how to bring themselves to orgasm. For the rest of us who know what we are doing but are just frustrated that we cannot climax during intercourse, this book's ""three-step guide"" is rather disappointing.1) get on top2) masturbate3) fantasizeThat's it. I thought this book would be a guide to finding different positions and activities that would help with the process, it isn't. You hardly NEED your partner to experience what she is talking about. If I wanted to just perch and masturbate I could do that some other time. I was more interested in making my climax PART of the love making rather than this pause in active sex.If you are looking for a more complex and dynamic approach to the ""problem,"" look somewhere else. This is a guide for the masturbating novice and for people who don't mind the awkward ""perch, rub and dream"" halt in intercourse."
2,baby steps....,"Perhaps it was just my initial surprise upon recieving this book and realizing it wasn't a book, per se, it was actually nothing more than a glorified pamphlet...Whatever the reason, Claire D. Hutchins' wisdom was a great dissapointment. The ""advice"" consists mostly of deconstructing historical Western attitudes towards a woman's role in intercourse, and is anything but technical. If you are interested in breaking down your psychological subservience during sex, this may be a gentle baby step for you.However, if you are looking for even quasi-explicit tips and technique, look elsewhere. Every sexual advice column in Cosmo or Jane that adresses the same subject is going to offer the same basic advice, or in most cases, be more useful and informative (...) It's elementary, dears."
4,Nobody's Fault,"I am so glad this book came along and has released me from being responsible for my girlfriend's orgasm! I used to feel so guilty because she couldn't come. Now I know it's not my fault. It's not her fault - it's not anybody's fault, but she has learned to control her own orgasm response. We use this technique in sex all the time and we both are a lot happier now."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book, which enjoys the literary qualities of an article in the back of a hairstyle magazine, contains virtually no information. There's a reason it comes shrikwrapped. If anyone could look inside they would never buy it."
4,Big and foofie!,"This thing is MUCH larger and heavier than I thought it would be. I'm 5'10"" and nearly 200 lbs. and it's more than enough chair for me. When I curl up into a fetal position, it makes a great sleeper too. In fact, if you were to put 2 of these in tandem, it would be 8' long and make a great bed! Very comfortable and supportive; I can use it to play X-Box and watch TV for hours. Compressible, but regains its shape very well when you fluff it (just kick it a few times). It does have some kind of new foam-vapor smell to it, so if you're allergic to that stuff beware, but the smell has started to dissipate over the past few days. Overall, I'm happy with it, but probably would've been better off with the medium size chair."
5,Nice chair...huge!,This is a comfortable chair. It takes up a lot of room but the kids love to watch TV or read a book.
3,Beautiful and dull.,"Bruce Wayne discovers he is descended from the line of Gawain, and, presto, the Holy Grail comes to Gotham. This is, unsurprisingly, completely outside of DC's normal continuity, which is a real shame, as I'd love to see what happens when the Justice League starts brandishing the Sangraal around.The Chalice is campy - the scenery-chewing dialogue and irregularly-paced plot infused with a false solemnity that's about six times less grand than Indiana Jones 3.Fortunately, John Van Fleet's art is simply spectacular - miraculously giving this graphic novel a bit of otherwise-absent depth. As an example of an uneven pairing of art and writing, The Chalice is right up there with Alex Ross and Mark Waid'sKingdom Come."
3,"Interesting art, good premise, but...","Batman finds himself in the position of being the protector of the fabled Holy Grail. An intriguing concept, but, as some of the other reviews here state, this graphic novel is ultimately unsatisfying.While the art is interesting, and there are some nice moments, there's no good resolution to the story, and no real explanation of Batman's ties to the Grail. The ending feels rushed, and with the villains assembled here (including Ra's Al Ghul), this could have been a very strong story.It's worth a look for the art, if nothing else, but certainly not a ""keeper."""
1,poor design and sound quality,"Whoever thought of this set up for speakers should be shot. The subwoofer does not disconnect from the small speakers so it makes most desktop configurations difficult at best. And to beat that, the sound quality is poor. There is a lot of static like I'm listening to a car radio. It's just not balanced sound. I guess you get what you pay for though."
2,Studio recording ruins the natural guitar sound,"These guys are great players. But the CD sound really sucks. It's recorded in a NYC studio and artificial reverb is added to it which has totally destroyed the natural guitar timbre. It sounds chemical and cellophane. Also, the Piazzolla piece really downgrades the selection. Otherwise, nice work."
4,The Little Red Wagon.,I bought the Flyer Wagon for my granddaughter as a Christmas present. She loved it.
2,Conflict and Communication,"I was expecting more concentration on verbal, non verbal skills used in communication and conflict between the parties involved rather than puzzles, centering, diversity, and teamwork, although I realize all those could be involved in the title mentioned. There were a few that focused on the actual dialogue that I did find helpful. Also, many involved anywhere from an hour to a full day's participation. In my 4-12-hour presentations, I am looking for shorter, such as 15-30 or 45-minute activities to emphasize points I have made and let the attendees actually particpate using those. It is easy to hear someone say something works; much harder to ""do it yourself."" I think activities are important in training sessions and rely on them a great deal for a total integration of the subject matter and diversion of presentation, but most of the ones in the book were way too long and not on the points I needed."
5,Great resource!,"I looked at a lot of books before I ordered this one from Amazon, and I'm glad I did. The training exercises are great and exactly what I needed to complement my planned training. The exercises are well explained, interesting, and provocative. The only thing I'd add is that as an HR professional, I'd make some slight changes to one or two exercises to not focus on physical characteristics.Worth the investment and a great source even if you're just looking for icebreakers for other types of training."
2,not useful,This attractive book is packed with a hodgepodge of activities the authors evidently enjoyed in their workplace or other setting. It is not at all useful for my setting as a prison therapist.
3,Not a bad little sword.,It's not the best quality sword out there but it is inexpensive and the blade is functional and sharp. The only drawback to this item is that the scabbard is pretty cheaply made and makes unsheathing the sword difficult.
3,Buy a Size Larger in These Wranglers,"My husband likes these pants but wishes he had known they seem to run a size smaller than he normally wears. The length is fine, but the waist seems a little snug compared to the same size pants in other brands. He does love the cotton material, though. Would be very comfortable if a size larger."
4,nice fit,nice fit the size is good and a lot of room a little long but not hard to fix but over a nice pants and good for work
4,Have these in several colors,"The run just a little big but are great. So far it seems nearly impossible to stain them. I have gotten grass, mud, various foods and even a little blood on them and all of it came out."
1,Sizing not consistent with prior purchases of Wrangler,"The waist was smaller than other Wranglers purchased in the past. Sad to say that it was a significant difference so they can't be worn right now. If other pants and a less expensive pair from a local retailer had a similar fit I might view it differently but all others of the same size are comparable in fit. These are definitely smaller than all others that have been purchased, Wrangler included. They are also more expensive. Won't buy again."
3,Thin thighs in 30 days,"I received this product timely, in good order and for a okay price. It was a much older version than I was expecting. It was done in the early 80's, but it works."
5,Great,I've had cats for a decade and have tried all kinds of litters. This one is by far the best. I just adopted a kitty and the litter is right at the foot of my bed. I can't smell a thing and I have a very very sensitive sense of smell!
2,Bad Yanni,"How can there be BAD YANNI? Isn't that redundant? But, this album really does demonstrate that such a phenomenon exists. Truly impressive.So why two, and not one, stars? The music here is hilarious. He is trying to play instrumental Styx. And, my god, it's almost worth owning this album for that humor value alone."
2,Not my style of fantasy,"I have only recently discovered Piers Anthony. The first two books of his I read were 'Isle of Woman' and 'Shame of Man'. I classify them as ""prehistory/early historical fiction"" although the library had them classified as ""fantasy"". I enjoyed them so much that I went looking to see what else this author had written and found his Xanth series. This is the first one I picked up. If you want a description of the story, read the review by Arthur W. Jordin; it's excellent. Personally, I did not care for it. I like fantasy novels, but this one is not my style. I know this author has a huge fan base, but I found this novel boring and the puns got old very quickly. So, this is an author that I will just have to be selective about which of his works I read."
1,Currant Events,"I know I am in a minority but this has to be the most boring, and poorly written book I have read in a long. The description of people and places left me with very little to work with pictorally. I have been writing short stories for children for many years so I don't lack imagination.I will try other of his books but if they are a bad as this one I will probably give up on his work as a source of entertainment."
3,I have never forgotten this book,"OK, so this book is more fiction than fact, atleast as it pertains to this one case, since it's a composite story. So, as a work of fiction I think it's phenomenal. I randomly picked this book in highschool off the library shelf. I was interested in becoming a social worker at that time in my life. The story was moving, horrifying, and will make you angry.It's hard to believe these things still happen, and we live in a society when this form of abuse is not uncommon.The story might horrify you, but it will move you, and inspire you as well. I decided later in life that I did not have what it takes to be a social worker. I know I could not leave work, and leave behind the children whose lives have been broken. I think it would destroy my life, as I would never be able to seperate or detach myself from them. This book always stayed with me, and I never forgot it. The folks who do the work of Mrs. Craig are nothing other than heroes!"
2,Very disappointed,"I looked forward to reading this memoir, as I liked Celestine Sibley's books so much; however, it appears her writing abilities were not passed on to her granddaughter. After too many sentences starting with, ""Me and so and so..."" instead of ""So and so and I,"" the incorrect use of lie and lay, and so many short, choppy sentences, I quit reading except for searching out the letters from Celestine Sibley that were included and the circumstances surrounding her death."
3,Celestine Sibley: A Granddaughter's Reminiscence,A nice little book to be skimmed through in one night. Don't look for anything new or revealing about Celestine. Numerous grammatical errors and skimpy on the photos.
3,Nice Read,"This was a good book. A story about Reese Delaware, a reporter with the ability to seek out the truth, except when it comes to her own past and the handsome Maxwell Knight with a shadowy past of his own. The book and the movie have two different story lines. I have seen the movie and read the book and they are very different, I personally perfer the book because it was written with more detail and gives a better veiw of the characters and what is actually going on in their lives. Not one of my favorite Donna Hill books but, a nice read."
4,So Many Secrets,"This is a great story as I see it, with so many secrets. I really enjoyed the mysteries and secrets . I found myself trying to count them all. I kept thinking there's enough secrets in this story to have written two books one being a sequel. However that certainly did not take away from the story I think Donna Hill does a great job with mysteries."
1,"Yuck, boring, horrific writing, the movie was better","I have hardly ever advised this before, but to all potential readers, I have some advice to give you: Skip the book, watch the movie. Intimate Betrayal was a betrayal alright, I felt betrayed from the first words to the last. This is the most heavily cliched piece of writing I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Had I not seen the movie first, which I usually do not do, but it had some up and coming actors I would never have picked up the book. After reading the introduction of the book I was mistakingly optimistic, thinking it could only get better. WRONG! It got worse and worse and worse. Dont' waste your time."
5,"Complex, enjoyable story.","I picked up Intimate Betrayal the book after seeing the movie. The movie only whet my appetite for the book. And, I'm glad I did! Reese and Maxwell are two interesting people who have secrets and empty spaces in their lives. The similarity in their struggles to succeed is subtle at first, but it becomes obvious. The attraction between them was obvious and it went from smoldering to hot. Ms. Hill has written a very enjoyable story with multi-faceted characters and situations. Read this and savor it."
2,Glad to be done with this one.,Finally it's done. I struggled to finish this one. Too many side stories of confusion for me. Not what I expect from Ms.Hill. Sorry to say...this one was a full miss for me.
2,Fails due to lack of examples and clear explanations,"This book seems to be more of a reference to complex analysis theorems than a book that one can study from. There are very few examples, and even fewer are clearly worked through. There are no solutions or even answers to selected exercises. The text itself is rather formal and dry, not particularly difficult to read through. Other books tend to follow a formal definition or theorem with a ""plain English"" description together with an apt example - this is definitely lacking here.So, if you know complex analysis and are looking for a basic reference book, then this may suit your needs. If on the other hand you want a book to study complex analysis from, then unfortunately I cannot give my recommendation."
2,Second edition is not suitable for study,"This seems to be a complex analysis book for people who already know complex analysis. I took an introductory course in complex analysis that used this book. I would not recommend using this text to learn complex analysis. The text mostly consists of standard explanatory material and proofs. As other reviewers have indicated, examples are scarce (some chapters have none!), and no answers to any (non-proof) exercises are given. And this is the second edition, which is claimed to have expanded on problems and examples (I suspect this claim to be a practical joke by Priestly). Overall, my experience with the second edition wasn't completely horrible, but the lack of answers to problems was a huge barrier to actually learning the material.In summary: if you are learning complex analysis, look for a text with better ratings. If you already know complex analysis and just need a refresher, this could be useful."
5,"If you're on the fence about buying this book, jump down!","Before I finished the first chapter of this book, I saw a dramatic difference in my writing. If you want to learn how to connect with the mysterious well where all of our stories come from, if you want to understand what really grabs your reader and connects him/her with your story, read this book! It's not just for short story writers. It's for writers. Period. Look through Colleen Mariah Rae's eyes as you devour this book, and you'll see your creative world in a whole new light!"
2,Basic & Boring,This book is way too expensive. The information is basic and obvious to the point that if you don't know it already then you probably weren't meant to be a leader.
5,Valuable research based information,Hall and Hord's concerns- based change theory is powerful and useful to any change agent.....also valuable for disciplines other than education. Research based .... Required reading.
3,The Lost Journal,"Imaging losing your journal which you have kept for the last five years, oh the secrets on those pages. When Sharonda Williams discovers her journal is gone, she is crazy with who, what, when, and where could it be. Why is she so upset? Because the journal contains her deepest darkest erotic feeelings. Indigo V jumps off to a wonderful start going through all the erotica in the journal, then it fizzles out to be no more than a poor X-rated movie. The plot of the lost journal was a good one which is why I gave the book a three..."
3,OK ROASTER,I LIKE THIS ROASTER BUT IT IS NO NESCO ROASTER I NEED TO GET ANOTHER NESCO ROASTER BUT THIS ONE IS OK IF YOU NEVER USED A NESCO
4,Great large capacity roaster,"The roaster was ordered for our church for cooking beans for public suppers. It also is used to keep sauces, vegetables, and soup warm. The new roaster replaces the one that finally burned out after several years of heavy use."
5,"Great ""Feel Good"" book","I gave this book to a friend last week who was mourning the loss of his brother. I hope he can find some joy and closure within the words on the pages.This book is full of people just like me and you have ""Amazing experiences"" taking the time out of their lives to share with us... True Blessing.. Robyn"
4,its a good remix album,"This cd is really good, only like 2-3 songs that werent. Good tracks to look for: This Is How We Do, Back Up (with Juve), Against The Wall, Down South(with Ludacris, Lil Wayne, and Jazze Phe. One of the best tracks right herre, Lil wayne sounds crazy screwed, luda is nice too), Gangsta Girl(with Rkelly.), and Big Money Heavyweight( check out the work dj mike watts does on the hook of this one). good cd go get it."
4,"Aladdin, the Perfect Hero","This is a great video for Aladdin fans of all ages. It is exciting, adventurous, and heroic. It is a wonderful video, teaching about the values of giving credit others deserve, keeping your promises, and that you can decide your fate (it isn't preprogrammed for you). The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there are two episodes on this tape, and only one of them involves the Pincess Jasmine."
5,Relaxing and beautiful,"Wai Lana's style of yoga is very peaceful, relaxing, and great for cultivating energy. This first series is as it says ""easy"" but that's not the point. The point is it makes you feel great. She knows how to teach you to breathe and listen to your body to get the most out of the yoga positions."
1,NO STAR RATING REALLY !!!!! RUBBISH!!!!!! SORRY NEVILLE,"Dear prospective consumer,Under no circumstances purchase this CD! This is basically a series of cover tunes sung by former member Neville Staple. I was stupid enough to buy this and it is now propping up the wonkie end of my coffee table! I was hoping for some serious fun boy three reminiscing of my home country and my teenage life spent kicking about the London Borough of Merton and other such wonderful fun zones, Brixton especially. Anyway this is not what you would expect it to be and if you really feel up to tossing your money away then go mad!Otherwise stay well clear of this dodgie recording. Sorry Neville I am sure you probably need the dosh!"
1,Misleading...,"When you purchase ""The Best Of"" this or that band, you expect the *original* songs. Unfortunately this is not the case, and this fact is not made clear until you have wasted your money.You would do infinitely better getting the proper ""Best Of"" compilations of the two bands on separate albums.One star for misleading the public..."
5,"Digital Image Suite, 2006 old version","Learned an earlier version of Digital Image Suite (2002), and used for several years. Decided to 'advance' to Photoshop 8 after being told it was a superior product. Mistake! Photoshop 8 is cumbersome, meandering, and way too heavy with complex rules. Digital Image Suite was listed as discontinued, however I was delighted to find that a more recent, unfortunately not current, 2006 version was available. I am back in business with software that is easy to understand, easy to find and assign photos to a group, and simple to do all the complex photo editing I enjoy."
4,"...from ArtsyFartsy News, June/July 2011","In the late 1940s, Mark Rothko explained, ""The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience as I had when I painted them.""Of course, he's well known for creating wall-scale abstract paintings that filled the viewer's field of vision and became a form of environment.With penetrating interviews from his daughter Kate and his son Christopher, this documentary is the best and most clear explanation on the famous Seagram's murals, and his now dedicated room at London's Tate Modern.Rothko was with the period of Abstract Expressionists who wanted to be unique. Existentialism was a popular influence on the painters' intellectual search.Imagine sitting in the center of a private room at The Tate, literally surrounded by huge Rothkos and listening to Mozart's Don Giovanni or Brahm's 3rd Symphony. You'll see and hear it all on this well produced DVD.[...]"
5,Laugh out lout funny,"Maybe it's just my age, but from the moment I picked up this book and started reading I couldn't top chuckling. Anyone who has every traveled, whether here at home or abroad can appreciate this book. Years ago I read one of her books on motherhood and I didn't find it nearly as funny as this one. Maybe because I am now in my fifties instead of my 20's? Great read if you love to travel."
4,Bombeck's travel don'ts,"This is not one of Bombeck's funniest, but it is typical of her humorous work, and provides some ""laugh out loud"" moments. There are also some poignant moments where Bombeck gets serious about connections that were made between her and women of another culture. If you want to know where not to go and what not to do on vacation, check out this book."
2,Trying Too Hard,"The first few chapters got me laughing, yes. But later on, I felt like I was reading a stand up comedian's script. It made me feel that everytime she goes on a vacation, she turns every moment as an oppurtunity to make it derogatorily funny. A bit too pessimistic for me.i liked however how she pointed out the 'usual' members of a travel group and the confinement of travelling with a group.sometimes the accounts are too exagerrated, bordering on slapstick: (when she decided to travel and not be a house-sitter anymore, she held up her hands to declare this, clutching the neighbor's hamster).This is a book that may be enjoyed by people who travel so that they could be reminded of how things are all better 'back home'. People who genuinely love to travel (for love of culture and other purposes) may find it a waste of time reading this."
3,Annoying,"I am a fan of Erma Bombeck and have enjoyed her (other) books for years. This book details the troubles she's had while traveling. It's funny, of course, but it seems to lack the depth and grace of her other books. As a person who cannot afford to travel, I found it hard to listen to her complain about the hardships and pitfalls of traveling the world. She rarely had a good word to say about most of the places she had visited, and didn't express gratitude for the opportunities she had been given. (I'm assuming the book is based on her real-life experiences, as it was presented that way, but who knows). She did strike the right chord in her chapter about Russia, but it was brief. I wish she had shared more of that type of sentiment. I think it would have been easier to relate to the book and it wouldn't have lost any of the humor."
5,Sidesplitting!Excellent,"Erma Bombeck is the most hillarious writer I have read!Please read this book,the humour is so devine.I couldn't stop laughing at this wonderful tale of travel and the experiences had by Erma and her husband.There's something in here that everyone can relate to even if you have never travelled abroad.Very well written with a laugh in every page.Thanks Erma,for a wonderful book!"
3,Leave your husband at home.,I would recommend this book to my friends who have a good sense of humour.Her discriptions are wonderful- no wonder she had such a following.
5,Mellow is not bad!,"Reading through some of the reviews of this CD might make many DMB fans pass on this album. True, this CD is not classic Dave Matthews Band. It doesn't have many of the grooves that ""Crash"" or ""Under the Table"" have. However, it is the most honest and most musically nuanced music that Dave Matthews has produced in a long time. The songs are generally not ""driving"" or ""fast"", but if all you like is driving and fast, grab some speed metal or some Britney Spears.Most importantly, this album is not a sellout to the tastes of pop America like ""Everyday"". It is a real album with real music that is often quite complex. Because real music often takes a little time to appreciate fully, listen to it at least two or three times before you make your final decision."
4,You can wrap up in it like a blanket,"As a huge DMB fan I eagerly gobble up everything these musical gods put out. And while I only fell in love with about half the songs on this album, the others are still worthy contributions that stand up musically. Furthermore, this is one of those albums where the entire album has a ""feel"" or mood that is fairly pervasive... get comfortable and explore the Davesphere. Lyrically, musically and sonically as brilliant as ever, even if in a quieter mood than you're used to. This album shows off Dave's vocal range more than any other, and he pushes himself as a singer much further on these songs. Only 4 stars because, even though I've worn out tracks like ""Dodo"", ""So Damn Lucky"" and ""Some Devil"", 5 stars still gets reserved for Dave's albums with the band. Buy if you're a Dave fan, if new to Dave Matthews, introduce yourself with DMB's albums first."
2,no groove for Dave alone,"Some Devil lets us fully understand how much importand the ""band"" is for the sound of DMB. Actually the disc lacks the groove and excitation of the records of the band. Dave does his best to be nice and clean, but the result is pretty boring, like a poor man editon of U2...Dave (and Trey): stand by your men!"
2,Depressing,"With the ill-advised miserable solo song ""Gravedigger"" (and its accompanying quick-cut video of equally miserable images) Dave Matthews essentially brought his career to a screeching halt, at least for those who aren't diehard fans. What on earth was he thinking? ""Grrravedigger..."" Who wants to listen to this dismal whining more than once? Diehard fans, I guess, but not me."
5,Amazing album,"What an amazing album!!! I personally did not think Dave could pull off a solo album without Carter, Boyd, Stefan, and Leroi, but lo and behold he has truly made a work of art. From the enviromental ""Dodo"" to the haunting tale of the people in ""Gravedigger,"" Dave has managed to create beautiful works of art that I thought he might not be capable of creating anymore. The haunting ""An Another Thing"" has Dave singing in all falsettos, giving the song a beautiful layer on top of a wonderful orchestra. ""Up and Away"" shows Bob Marley's influence on Dave, and even there Marley would be proud. Overall, the 14 song CD would be great for any person, regardless of whether or not you've always been a Dave Matthews/Dave Matthews Band fan. This labum is for people who like music."
5,SOME DEVIL,"Wow. Dave's first solo album is simply amazing. He writes his lyrics with such honesty and thought. He shows his voice range throughout. He has tons of guests- including tim reynolds (long time friend of dave's) and trey anastasio of phish. These songs have a beautiful simplicity to them. Yes, it is different than a DMB album, and that's what makes it so interesting and great."
3,Different...but still solid,"This album is not what you've come to expect from Dave Matthews, but since the release of ""Everyday,"" one doesn't really know what to expect. With catchy electric guitar riffs throughout much of the album, it fits more solidly into the ""rock"" genre than most of the music Dave has recorded with the Dave Matthews Band. However, ""Some Devil"" is still less polished and more musically sophisticated than ""Everyday."" Songs like ""Save Me"" and ""Oh"" have a pop quality that will catch your attention as you skim the album, but as you settle into the style of the CD, you'll begin to appreciate the depth added to most of the songs by the variety of accomplished musicians Dave has chosen to include on the album. This won't be a favorite of Dave's concert going, core fan base, but it's still a solid album and worth picking up."
5,Mmm Dave,I moved to Australia three years ago and I must say what I miss the most is Dave. No one here knows who he is! It's a pity and I doubt they/he will ever tour here.This album is the first I have thoroughly enjoyed in a very long time. I have always been a much bigger fan of Dave's ballads and this has a lot of 'em. Every time I listen to it I like it more!
3,certainly not the best,"Some Devil is similar to Everyday, with not much jamming. Dave uses electric guitar for most of the songs. I agree the lyrics are excellent, but compared to his older albums, Some Devil is just not as good. It might be because of the absence of the acoustic sounds."
5,"WOW, one of my favorites","I own just about every CD that Dave Matthews has ever released, and this is one of my favorites for sure. The songs on this CD are so full of soul and emotion. He really hit it out of the park on this one. A great CD for any DMB fan or anyone who like a little blues in with their rock."
4,Powerful solo effort by a musical genius,"Dave Matthews' first (and hopeful of many) solo effort is exactly what it should be. Full of emotion, powerful lyrics, crisp and original music and Dave's trademark (and exceptionally strong) vocals. Apart from a few melodic inconsistencies, Dave has put together a brilliant album that hits dramatic highs and somber lows. Some Devil is the kind of album that will appeal to both die-hard fans of the Dave Matthews Band as well as those who have barely heard a single tune from one of the best-selling concert performers. Especially remarkable are the title tune, Oh, Stay or Leave, Up and Away, and An' Another Thing. Listen to this album consistently and you'll develop an appreciation for Dave's lyrical prowess and ability to put together a group of musicians with unique talents.Purchase this album. Put it on repeat. Listen with your eyes closed."
1,Who are you and what have you done with Dave?,"When I first heard the music of Dave Matthews about 7 years ago, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It was (and still is) beautiful. This album is not Dave Matthews. It is crap. I want to cry when I think about it. Dave was my hero. I thought that neither he or his music would be influenced by radio or TV or money. But I guess I was wrong. The only reason I give this album 1 star is because of the presence of Trey Anastasio."
1,Dave at his worst!!,"This CD is absolutely awful. With the exception of Gravedigger, none of these songs will ever reach the radio. I purchased this CD and its the biggest waste of $15 Ive ever spent.I dont know what the deal has been with Dave lately, but there have been very very few good releases since the good ole days such as #41 and Crash. ""Some Devil"" makes Busted Stuff sound like a platinum super star recording. (and thats not saying much)Save your $15 for when Dave comes to town and just hope he doesnt play any of the pathetic songs off of this CD."
1,Gravedigger...please bury this song,"When I heard the song ""Gravedigger"" on the radio, I couldn't believe a star as big as Dave Matthews did it. The lyrics were worse than the music. ""Make your grave shallow so you can feel the rain""? Dude, you're DEAD. Weather patterns will be pretty much outside your senses at that point.Then I saw the video. Of course, we need to see clips of the vicious White slave-owner mercilessly whipping a Black slave. Yes, only White men in pick-up trucks run over children. Absolutely, little boys on bicycles are sent to die in America's wars. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Aren't we cool? We hate ourselves.Give me a break."
1,Dave Matthews Band,I have always not been a fan of DMB he sucks and his band is great there were not even hits off this one what can you say
5,What were you expecting?,"People people people. If you didn't give this album AT LEAST 4 stars, then you need to take another look at the cover. It says ""DAVE MATTHEWS""... without the ""BAND."" How can you expect the two to be the same!?DMB is by far my favorite group of musicians. But this CD just plain rocks. While DMB might be more uptempo, this CD has catchy riffs and lyrics that soothe the soul.By far one of the best CDs I've ever bought.Sorry if you were expecting different, but don't give this CD a bad review just because it isn't like any of DMB's stuff."
2,Disappointment,"I love the dave Matthews Band, but this solo album doesn't live up to expectations. I find it boring and lacking soul. I expected to like it and am disappointed I don't."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am a Dave Matthews fan and am giving this a two, just becasue it is Dave Matthews. Looks like he took a stab a changing his style but here is some advice from a loyal fan, change it back!"
2,MATTHEWS DEVIL IS HE SOUNDS LIKE THE SAME OLE SHTICK.,"""Some Devil"" is Dave Matthews Band without the ""Band"".Dave Matthews just keeps getting more droning and boring than ever. A big disappointment of a CD.One good song - Gravedigger which is acoustic. The only reason it keeps from getting one star.Just listen to your other DMB albums,...this is just a watered down version."
1,1&half to a 2 pretty Corny,i still haven't quite figured out how Dave Matthews gets over like He does? the folky vibe mixed in with His Down in the dumps element is like Magic to some but just leaves me sleepy.this Solo Set goes down the same road as much of the stuff He has done with the Band.nothing surprising here&His vocals are kinda flat through out as well.but again he will rack up as far as Sales goes.but His Music just doesn't move me to understand the full hype He gets.He might have a Ok song here&there but this Cat truly gets way over.
2,Terribly disappointed,"Let's not kid ourselves, what makes Dave Matthews great is the band! I have yet to meet a person who is fond of Dave's voice by itself. I don't really understand what Dave is trying to prove. I personally own all of their CDs and what I really like about them is their rock/jazz fusion. The band is extremelly talented (including Dave himself), but in this CD Dave made a big mistake. Seems to me he sort sold out for the more romantic, pop, bread-and-butter music. If you're a big fan there's nothing I can say that will stop you from buying it, however, if you're interested but not decided, I'd strongly suggest for you to skip this one and wait until the band re-unites.Obviously the ones who think what I'm saying about Dave's voice is not factual, dont know much about music theory and are just ""heart-broken"" than someone critized their idol. Good grief, you people should get a life."
2,What happened?,"I am a huge DMB fan. I purchased this album not knowing what to expect. I have read some of the other reviews, and everyone has rights to there own opinion, obviously. But I have to say after listening to this album only once, I find myself asking, where is the power and the passion that Dave usually has. People will say Blah blah, this guy thought he was buying the DMB, he has to think outside the square. Thats garbage as even when playing acoustically with Tim, there is more life to him than this album has.It seems to me that this album is just one long version of the same song. A lot of them sound very similar. I cant think of a fast tracked upbeat tune. Each one seems to moan and drag along and then almost melt into the next.Not to say I am never going to listen to it again, but thus far I am terribly dissapointed and was expecting better. Much better."
3,"Not DMB, but not bad.","This album has become highly overrated by some. It is NOT the greatest album ever. It also underrated my some. It does NOT suck. I thought it was pretty good, and it is one I will listen to once in a while. Although this album is good, it is not as good as Jack Johnson's Brushfire Fairytales, or John Mayer's Heavier Things."
2,Long Time Fan... Long List of Dissapointments,"I must admit I approached this album with both trepidation and excitment. As a first solo attempt I knew this would have to reflect superior writing, which I know Dave is capable of, and include great studio musicians. The musicians are up to par but the writing is not. Some of it sounds like it was written while in the loo! Many of the lyrics are actually childish and don't have the depth that comes with the experience of an accomplished songwriter. Has Dave become so big that he can't look at his work critically? If so, go on hiatus till you can find that place again that led to such early inspirations as ""Minarets"" and ""Warehouse"". I feel like I can write a review such as this since I've been a fan since 1994. No need to rush... true fans don't go away unless they've lost faith and unfortunately with writing such as this my faith is waning."
3,Dave slips on a Banana!,"I was anticipating this album along with new albums by Deep Purple (Bananas) and Neal Young (Greendale). My three favorite artists all with new albums in the same year. Yeah!Young was first and was a big let down, with only a couple good songs and sub-par concept vision. Does anyone really need to hear about Grandpas coffee pot. Then came Deep Purple's Bananas disc and what a great album and what a pleasant surprise, a 51 minute album that never drops the baton, from start to finish, inspired music making and great production. Bravo DP!!!This has got to be the best album of 2003, replacing Fleetwood Mac's Say You Will.Now comes Some Devil and it's almost as enjoyable as Purple's but Dave drops the baton a couple times with too many filler songs.It's great to have artists that still try to make ""good"" music and not rest on their laurels.5 stars: Bananas3 stars: Some Devil2 stars: Greendale"
4,Takes some getting used too,"I think that its about time dave came out with a solo album, i've been waiting for this album since i heard about it, and i have to say i'm not dissipointed at all with a great different sounding dave style such as ""Save Me"" and ""Oh"" a favorite so far. All in all i think that casual listeners probably would not enjoy this as much as dave fans, althought the addition of the bonus disc with Dave and Tim Reynolds live is awesome i also reccomend Tim Reynolds ""Stream"" album."
5,Spectacular,"I LOVE it! Gravedigger is amazing in both the studio and the live acoustic versions; Grey Blue Eyes is great to unwind with, provided that you have a dog, cat, cup of tea, or any combination of the aforesaid. The live acoustic rendition of Grey Street produces more dopamine than a strong cup of coffee. Knowing what I know, I'd gladly pay $150 for this album."
4,Worth Your Money,"Dave Matthews, a talented singer/songwriter. This CD is masterpiece SOLO album. Although it is great it is not a DAVE MATTHEWS BAND album. It lacks the certain energy and fun that the DMB albums create. It is definetly a good listen giving great tunes like So Damn Lucky and Gravedigger, also Save Me and Dodo. Most tracks are well written and have meaning. On a side note, if you ever get a chance to see DMB live take it, there live show are spectacular! Enjoy the album!"
3,Some Devil...Some Angel,"This, the first solo album from Dave Matthews, is pretty much a mixed bag. The songs, on the whole, are a bit more subdued and darker then you'll find on the last two DMB albums. Which i realize is the main reason he wanted to branch out and try something on his own...to be a bit different. But in all honesty, these songs COULD have very easily been part of the next DMB cd. so there really isn't anything THAT different about the music found here.There are a few really stand-out songs here...""Too High"" and ""Oh"" come to mind especially. But i guess i was left with a feeling of wanting a bit more variety, and a little less brooding."
2,I guess I just miss the rest of the guys...,"What can I say? I know I shouldn't compare this CD to the others in my collection by the full band, but it's hard not to do. Dave definitely has a great voice, but this CD is just lacking ""something"" and I believe it is what the rest of the guys contribute. The bonus CD is good if you enjoy all acoustic music, but again, I miss the drums, horns, bass etc. I guess I just miss the rest of the guys... Sorry, Dave!"
2,Better than counting sheep,"This is the perfect music to play at bedtime.Dave Matthews has certainly found a cure for insomnia.There is a lack of real passion in this music,it is so devoid of the special ""something"" you look for in a Dave Matthews release.It is a cd that will get a listen or two,and then be lost in the shuffle.Perhaps his music has some ""real substance"" behind it,and I'm just not getting it. Unfortunately I will never listen to this enough to discover any of that."
3,Something's missing,"Now don't write off this review as bias just because I am a huge fan of DMB, but I didn't really think that Some Devil was anything to really be excited about. It featured some of Dave's weaker song writing skills, but making up for it were some great players including Timmy Reynolds and Trey Annastaio. The album is good by pop standards, but weak by the standards that Dave Matthews has built himself up to."
3,Not bad.,"While this record is no masterpiece it is a good listen. Worth picking up if you want to hear Dave do something away from the band. And it has Trey from Phish, how could you go wrong?"
4,Different,"I love reading reviews saying ""This is nothing like (insert your favorite DMB CD). This is not a DMB CD and will never be a DMB CD. Dave once again proves that he isn't and does not really want to be mainstream. He writes and plays what is on his mind and more often than not a large minority of people aren't going to like it. Anyway the CD is well written, the lyrics deep and thoughtful and orchestration and mixing on the songs is great. Steer clear if you want classic DMB, pick it up if you want to hear a change from Dave Matthews.p.s. to the person who wrote that Dave played the electric guitar on most songs you are a moron! Dave plays the acoustic on most tracks while Trey Anastasio and Tim Reynolds back him up on electric."
2,Biased fans,"All of the reviews for this cd I have read are from the most biased fans in the world, DMB fans. He could put out the worst cd in history and most of the reviews would still be five stars. In my opinion, Dave hasnt released anything good since Crash. This album seems too slow and uninspired. Gravedigger is just too weak of a song. It has been recieving the most praise on the album, but it is my least favorite. The saving grace on this album is the support from other artists such as the immensely talented Trey Anastasio. He cowrote 'Grey Blue Eyes' and it is a nice slow jam, my favorite on the album. A 5 star album should be a great album. This just isnt it. Please keep your bias out of the reviews."
3,don't expect too much but to fall asleep,"I am BIG fan of dmb but I'm not into dave matthews solo debut. I do agree though that dave matthews lyrics are amazing but just the musicians he choose to work with just do not work well with his music. I seriously almost feel asleep listening to the cd after 20 minutes...none of the songs are up-beat at all. I do give dave 3 stars for trying a solo album but I'll be very disappointed if he continues his solo route, it's not what his fans are looking for."
1,Go Back to the Band Dave,"Dave's solo attempt isn't quite as bad as Boyd Tinsley's but close. What struck me was the lack of acoustic guitar. Dave is know for his acoustic axe, but most of the songs on the album play with simple electric riffs. I thought Dave would be able to transition out but obviously the instrumentation of DMB in combination with Dave's songwriting that produces decent music."
2,Where's the Band???,"I'm so disappointed, it's the first time that I'm being fooled by an artist.Where's the band? Dave worth nothing without the great guys that formed this marvelous band...:-("
1,who's buying this?,"I really liked his album ""Crash"" and his sophomore album with ""Stay"" (my favorite song by his band). Even ""I Did It"" was pretty cool. But while they had good songs, all DMB did was repeat themselves. They have their limits and the music prooves it. I respect them as a band but they need to be more innovative. This record along with its singles will probably flop. Buy ""Crash"" instead."
1,Overrated,Picked up the new album. Bottom line: Overrated. The album is actually painful to listen to. Yes Dave is taking another road to try and be creative however this is just aweful. I think this CD will make a nice coaster for my living room however. Looking forward to a new DM BAND album to be released. Perhaps their gig in Central Park tomorrow night will be recorded and released QUICKLY!???
2,Dark and foreboding,"If the difference between Dave Matthews and Dave Matthews Band is that Dave gets to sing about depressing subjects and turn out albums that are basically exercises in gloom, I think he should stick with the band.I can't tell if the tracks are just pretentious or outright dark, but this CD bums me out every time I listen to it. There isn't a bright song in the bunch or anything that really rocks.If you are a die-hard DMB fan, skip this one. If you are a gothic in search of reason to jump off a building, buy this and listen to it for a couple of hours."
5,GROOOOOOVIN,"Well, when I first heard the idea of a Dave Matthews solo album, I was thrilled, especially when I heard of the presences of the likes of Trey and Tim on this album. Reading boards and pre-opinions of how the album would turn out, I was worried of another Everyday. Having heard ""Gravedigger,"" ""Stay or Leave,"" and ""An' Another Thing"" (reworked ""Little Thing""), I should have been smarter, but I wasn't. This album is one of the most interesting albums out right now. I really really like it alot, so far, and I've listened to it thefull way through like three times already, and I've had it for but a day. Stand out tracks are ""Dodo,"" ""So Damn Lucky,"" ""Gravedigger,"" ""Some Devil"", well, pretty much all of them are amazing. I'm a fan."
3,some devil review,"I'll keep this quick......been a faithful dave fan since I can remember, so i'm not going to lead people the wrong way. This album is good, i like it as something to throw on at work while i'm zoning out at my desk or background music when i'm in the sack. its along the same type of theme as most of the everyday album. the tone and rythme is slow, you don't have the ""Drive in Drive Out"" or ""Jimi Thing"" of old. Dave does a great job of putting a sense of emotion into these songs, but i can only enjoy this for so long without wanting dave to bust out a song i can jam to. the lyrical value of these songs is awesome, i think dave puts him feelings on paper here......but i hope this style of music is out of his system and he can get back to the old stuff that got him to this point as a musician....if you are a deep down dave fan, buy it....if you are looking for another Under the Table, or Crash, or Before these Crowded Streets; you should probably sit this one out."
5,Dave does it better than ever,"With alot of skepticism I preordered the new Dave album from his website. When it came in the mail yesterday I put it into my cd player to discover its probably the best work he's ever done. With upbeat songs such as Dodo to So Damn Lucky, and haunting solos from Grey Blue Eyes to Gravedigger this album is truely a masterpiece. It shows Daves creativity and ability to function without his other bandmates. I definately want to hear more from the band, but if this Dave is going to go solo for good , that wouldn't be a bad thing either."
4,Patience,Sounds exactly like I would expect DM to sound without the B. Clearly not as charged and edgy as we are used to but awfully good nevertheless. Listen to it once and walk away. Come back in an hour and put it on again.....starts to get to you. Play it the third time and you are hooked. It's that simple.
5,Take a chance on something new.......,"I have been a Dave Matthews Band fan for almost 10 years now. and considering I am only 22, that is a long time. All of the other fellas from DMB have solo discs and I was elated to see that dave released one. I think with the artists he worked with like trey and tim, he blended all sorts of sounds. You can hear the Trey Influence on Dodo (I recommend Trey's Solo Album as well) and Tim's Influence is evident through out.Reguardless, this album is still unique, and subtly passionate. Alot of reviewers are saying the album is depressing or not as intense as DMB discs. Well if dave matthews made a disc that was just like DMB, then what purpose does the whole band have?! The lryics and artistry on this album are brilliant, I have listend to this cd for hours stright, it is addicting. It is a must have in my book."
1,I ran out of Wal-Mart screaming!,"I was happily shopping at Wal-Mart until all of a sudden, I began hearing a Dave Matthews song (don't ask me which one as they all sound the same to me). That annoying voice grated on my very last nerve to the point I felt as though I had just died and woke up in a pile of pop poo poo! Dave Matthews is one of the reasons I stopped listening to commercial radio. There's something so irritating about Dave Matthew's voice that every time I hear it, I have to put my hands over my ears and go, ""la la la la la la la la la !!!"" I'm hoping that with all the new advancements in space exploration, that Dave Matthews will soon be exiled to another planet (hopefully in another galaxy) and that there won't be enough air to produce sound because God forbid those poor little martians and other celestial beings should have to suffer like we here on Earth."
1,it sucks as expected,"i've only cringed everytime i've heard this guy sing. so maybe i though it was the music (his band) that didn't suit to my taste too well. i heard this album and thought, "" yep, it's him"". i don't understand why this guy has so many fans, he can't sing, blabs on too much and is particularly ugly. then again his band is pretty lame and pretty ugly as well.dont' buy this sh*t and save your hard earned money."
5,Some Devil,"I wasn't sure how I would like the new Dave Mathews cd sans the other band members. The music is different then the usual DMB stuff I love, but it is really good. I had to listen to it a few times to really appreciate it."
5,Evolving Sound = Great Music,"I am an avid Dave Matthews fan so this CD was a must for me. Some Devil has a different feel to it, obviously because it's a solo CD. This CD has a great vibe to it. After my first listen I couldn't wait to hit the repeat button. I would recommend this CD to anyone with a good taste for music. If you just bought the John Mayer CD and you're still in your ""I can't believe I bought this awful CD"" mood, Get this album! Seriously, buy the album! It's great."
3,SOME DEVIL REVIEW,"Just bought the cd this morning and all I can say is that it is at least better than BOYD's solo CD. People may not like some devil right now but may grow to like it in the future. I personally enjoy the last half of the cd, but am not a fan at all of the first half. It is totally different music from what DMB produces. Not ""pop"" music like in Everyday, but still very lacking in the creativity and musical genious of BTCS and Crash. I miss OLD dave...NEW dave sucks..."
4,True Dave - What a Great CD,"I'm a DMB fan, but not a die hard. And I gained a newfound respect for Dave when he hosted a musical round on Austin City Limits, featuring the like of Emmylou Harris, Buddy & Julia Miller, and Patty Griffin. In an age of fabricated bands, Dave is a true musician and this album only serves to emphasize that fact. There is no brass section, nor poppy violin...it's just Dave and a few, albeit very talented, musician pals.Gravedigger, Grey Blue Eyes, An' Another Thing, and Too High are the songs that really caught my attention. But overall, the album is a joy to listen to from beginning to end. It's actually a really great thing to pop into the CD player on a rainy Sunday morning. Another reviewer used the word ""meander"" which is exactly what this album does...it meanders through a quite journey of blues, soul, and Dave's own african/pop/introspective mix.All in all - a great investment for those DMB fans who appreciate Dave for his talent."
5,Unbelievable.,"This album is without a doubt the finest metal recording of the new millenium. The arrangements rival Meshuggah's benchmark ""Chaosphere"" for sheer complexity, and the tempos have to be heard to be believed. What really fascinates me about this band is the way they make such odd-time changes flow and breathe while keeping things tight enough to imply sterility. Don't take my word for it. Listen to this opus for yourself....""and then you'll beg"" to hear the next one they release."
5,Brutally Smashing!!!!,Cryptopsy is badass. Seeing them live very soon. 2005 tour. Hailz All who buy this album.
2,What?,"Cryptopsy is a band that has ruled the technical DM scene for years, so I eagerly anticipated this release. while the music is still strong, Disalvo's vocals are so inexcusably ... that it negates all the positive aspects of this album. I'll stick with None So Vile and Lord Worm's sicka nd twisted vox anyday. Whisper Supremacy was ok, but track down Blasphemy Made Flesh and None So Vile and you'll be that much happier for it!"
3,"So focused on being hard, usually forgets to amongst the excess","Unfortunate speed metaler's have way too much talent on their hands, with not much to do with it. Cryptopsy might just be the fastest metal assault you will hear, but that does not always translate to good songs. Rather here, it never really does, instead being relegated to onslaught after onslaught of technically astounding, but skull numbingly repetitive and fragmented ""songs"" that are simply shredding exercises for these speed junkies. Guided by the constipated vocal pace and a three note range, this is best left for fans of the genre, or those daring enough to appreciate talent in all it's forms. This over-excessiveness that people always confuse for ""heavy"", does produce adrenaline pumping violence into your ears at an astounding rate, but is best lest appreciated in small, small doses."
2,Stopped Working After Two Weeks,"I loved this at first, but the front trigger design must have a flaw. After a couple of weeks, the water would keep running after I stopped putting pressure on the trigger. It has a lifetime warranty though."
4,I love this CD!,"An obscure fact: in the book ""The English Patient"" - but not in the movie based on the book - the song that Hannah is playing on the piano that draws Kirpal Singh (the Sikh bomb defuser) to the villa is ""When I Take My Sugar To Tea."" Another fact: There is no finer rendition of ""When I Take My Sugar To Tea"" than Leon Redbone's! I love this CD! Leon Redbone's sound is truly unique. He plays fine old tunes and somehow delivers the ""grammaphone"" quality in the music. If you want to hear piano tunes that will transport you back to the early part of the 20th century, then Leon Redbone is for you."
5,easy listening,the slower numbers on this disc make excellent late night listening with the volume turned up and a glass of port beside the open fire.
2,Corks fell off after only a few uses!!,"I used this mute only 3 or 4 times after receiving it when a cork fell off (during a concert!). FYI, I am not one of those trumpet players who muscles their mute into the bell with a strong twist. In fact, I have a pet peeve against those who do that! In fact, after the first cork fell off, i was able to EASILY pull the other two corks off by hand!! I didn't return the mute because it is a good sounding mute and it was a lot less hassle just to re-glue the corks myself."
2,Only for the historian not the swordsman,"I have no doubt that the author did indeed put a great deal of research into this work as evidenced by the liberal footnotes and historical sources quoted. The sad fact is that it comes across a dry, scholarly treatise devoid of passion. What I was hoping for were the author's own opinions and comments on the role and use of the sword, and perhaps how they were made.Instead a major portion of the book consists of lengthy quotes from musty hidebound tomes. A disappointment especially considering the glowing reviews by other readers."
3,Difficult read,"Burton's style is rather rampling and often digresses into discussions of anchient gods and the like. If you want to put up with the poetic prose, there is still good information to be gleaned from this book. However, if you are looking for an easy to read book concerning the history of the sword, stick with Oakeshott."
2,THE book not about medieval and renaissance swords,"This book is not about medieval swords. It starts at the dawn of time and proceeds until the Roman times. In fact, it's the first book of a trilogy that never materialized. Medieval and Renaissance swords figure only in passing notes. Oh, and prominently on the cover. Front and back, in text and picture. Without any hint whatsoever that they are not in there.That said, I have not read the book. I hope I will find the time and I'm sure there's a lot to learn from it.Two stars because this book has a solid potential to disappoint - and squarely goes for it."
2,Too Much Detail,"The book contained too much detail on manufacturing. I would have preferred the book to cover less ground. The review entitled ""Words, words, words"", encompasses my view exactly. Unfortunately I did not read all the reviews first. I will not make that mistake again."
5,ABSOLUTE CLASSIC - THE BEST,"If you like swords..this book is for you. If you like Victorian writing...this one is for you. Please, before you read the book, realize who wrote it and when he wrote it. The book is very, very detailed. It is written in a style which most are not use to, therefore making it a difficult read for some. Burton, a Master Swordsman, did a tremendous amount of reasearch on this book and it was not written for those looking for a light hearted literary romp. If you are not particularly interested in sharp weapons, word roots or wonderful Victorian writing, then this one may not be for you. On the other hand, if you are a serious student of such, then this one is a must for your book collection. I do wish that more of Burton's writings had been saved. I highly recommend."
3,A third of the history of the Sword,"Written in 1884, this book is full of the history and lore of the sword. Richard Burton was a historian, an explorer, and a fencer. His love of the sword is obvious as he follows it from its origins in prehistory to Roman times. You can tell that Burton believed no detail too small when it comes to the sword. He had a burning desire to tell what he knew, and this he did with great detail. It is obvious that this was to be a multi-volume series. Though written well....I was looking for information that would have been in Volume II. Since the series will never be complete; the title should be altered to include the time period reviewed. (With that done it would be 5 star, but I would have not bought it.)"
2,Very disappointing!,"The reviews of this were so good, I was expecting to get a terrific, fresh view of using leftovers...not so! This was not at all what I was expecting. There was not much in it that common sense wouldn't tell you. However, I DID like the introduction--but that doesn't warrant the cost of the book, I don't believe!"
2,Disappointed ---,"-- by constant leaking, either from oil dripping down from the spout or an actual small leak in the bottom seam, and I am now looking for something else. The spout works well in directing the oil exactly where you want it, and the can is attractive enough to keep out in the kitchen, so if a permanent oil ring doesn't bother you, this might work. Otherwise, I can't recommend it."
4,Superman/Batman Vol. 1: Public Enemies,"Awesome read that leads into another read, definitely a worthy introduction to a well-written Series."
2,Buy It For the Art,"Jeph Loeb is the luckiest writer in comic books today.For some reason, I haven't a clue why, He gets' paired with the best artists. Who compensate big time for his mediocre and not well thought out stories. And his books sell well.I won't even bother to go into the plot in this book because there really isn't one. It simply involves a convoluted 'story' where Batman and Superman take down Lex Luthor. Like another review posted the book is more about just as many characters from the DCU as possible into a book than it is with any credible story telling.I bought this book primarily for Ed McGuiness' artwork. I love the way he draws Batman. But that, and a later apearance by Huntress, are the two strongest selling points on this book. Jeph Loeb is not a good story teller, and I wish that someone at DC would stop spoiling by pairing him with artists he doesn't deserve to work with."
4,Good Story Robust Artwork,"Coming from Jeph Loeb one expects nothing but the best. Having read his other Batman works (The Long Halloween, Hush etc) you can essentially always expect gold from this guy. The art is very interesting, almost a cartoon style, very robust and colorful character models with defined cleft chins and bulging muscles. The story is pretty good the dialog is a little cliche at times but the Superman/Batman comparison is pretty great. I watched the animated movie of this graphic novel first (not one of my favorites) but now I have a whole new appreciation for it. I rented this book from my local library."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Superman and Batman finally think they have enough to remove President Lex Luthor from power. He does have enough clout though to order some of their allies into the field against them.This requires some clever tactics and use of cunning and some recruited aid of their own to get through it, and bring old baldy down."
4,Characters Over Plot,"The plot of this story isn't all that great, it doesn't break any new ground or is even that original, but the characterization of both Superman and Batman, especially in their thought boxes, are spectacularly unique. The way they play off each other and practically finish each others thoughts is something that has been imitated since with nowhere near the insight as the original. McGuiness' art is, as always, cartoonishly appropriate."
3,Over the top story which falls flat in the end...,"Joseph Loeb has been known for his writing talents for a long time, since he teamed up with Tim Sale to do Batman: The Long Halloween, Haunted Knight, Dark Victory and Superman For All Seasons.This time, however, it's just not all that great. Sure, the art is fun to look at, and the characters retain their...character, but the time twisting storylines and over the top actions and...gaint robots just don't suit Loeb's writing talents. For great writing, he excels at mystery stories with down to earth characters. This story however is so over the top that it just falls flat in the end. The art is great, and Loeb's pacing is good, but the story gets so lost in itself that in the end it's not enjoyable.So better luck next time. By far the best part of this story was the first 10 or so pages."
2,Potty Power DVD,My boys were not interested in this movie at all. Unfortunately I don't recommend this movie for potty training.
3,Cute but...,It didn't work for my [..]child at all. The child sings the songs but it has not motivated the child to try potty training. I also didn't like the part where it says big kids sleep in beds and babies in cribs. It confused our child who has no desire to stop being called our baby...so being a big kid and not a baby is no reward for our baby.
4,This video encouraged your kids to do potty,"We have twin boy and girl. When they were 18 months, I got this video and as soon as my girl watched it, she said ""potty powel...potty powel"" and ran to the bathroom. She is still in training now and my boy has recently showed interest as well."
2,Not impressed,This didn't work for us and was not very exciting. This features a much older crowd where are the two year olds? They all appear to be about kindergarten and that is a bit old for potty training these days.
1,A Real Stinker,"We were very disappointed with this video. It is billed as a training video, but it was more like a basement recording of the same song. It didn't hold our son's attention, and we would not recommend it."
3,mixed feelings...,"After reading such positive reviews on this video I had very high hopes for it to assist me with the daunting task of training my son. He does love the video and wants to watch it often, however, it does NOT make him want to use the potty. He just likes the music. I am still hopeful though for it to work...I just wish it wasn't so annoying for ME to listen to!"
5,great potty training tool,"We bought this DVD for my daughter's ""potty training day"" (with the help of Potty Train Your Child Your Child in Just One Day) and it was by far her favorite. She wasn't interested in Prudence and the Potty, and she didn't sit through Potty Time with Bear. But this one she watched twice in one day, and I didn't mind sitting through it either. One song got on my nerves (the one about what do you do when you are sitting on the potty), but otherwise, it was a cute video with catchy tunes and a good message. I liked the fact that it had real kids and not cartoons or animals. It worked well for my daughter, too, because it had a princess in the video and we had a princess themed potty party and she loved it."
4,-,It has all the concepts of potty training. It doesn't keep my daughter (18-month) attention till the end of the DVD. My daughter might be too young for it.
4,My 2 Year Old Daughter Loves this Video!,"We recently started potty training our 2 year old daughter. She enjoyed sitting on the potty, but with her diaper on or she would sit with her diaper off and then demand that a diaper be put on when she needed to go.She seemed to love the video from the first time she saw it. We have had it for about a week and my daughter has watched it once a day. The past two night she has actually sat on the potty and used it :-)I found the women narrater's voice a bit annoying...but other than that I think it is a good video."
2,definitely more for girls,"..also, probably for aolder kids, closer to 3. my daughter is 18months old and gets scared watching this video. she is not scared of her potty or her potty books, so it must be the video."
2,Not what I expected.,My 3 year old son is not at all interested in this video. The singing is a little annoying. The skit about a princess and the potty is amateurish and a diversion from the issue at hand.
2,NOT FOR BOYS!!,Even though it shows boys in the video I feel it is more for a girl especially with a princess in the end. Don't waste your money if your looking for a video for a boy. My son kinda liked it but then lost interest when the princess came.
3,ok video but not helpful for toddlers,This video is narrated by a cute woman and is put together effectively and professionally. I found it to be a slight waste of money and space. Most of our potty training efforts were hands on. I don't think that watching a video helped my boys learn more about potty training. But sometimes every little bit helps.
5,100% AWESOME!!! Sanity saver!,"This is thy BEST potty training product out there. It's real kids in the video, instead of animated ones. The songs are really catchy so not only is your child singing it, but you are too. My son (3+ yrs. old) wanted to go potty immediately after watching the video. It took him four days to go #2 (which he had never done before). He had a two accidents, maybe. I would say it took him 2 wks. to really get it. He still likes to show us when he goes potty, it's a family accomplishment. I don't know what the difference is between the 2009 & '04 version, but I bought the '09 and we love love it! Highly recommended."
5,Awesome!!,"This DVD is motivating and cheerful! The actress that teaches potty training to the little ones has such a bright, beautiful face and her voice is adorable! The children and trainer sing their way through potty learning and if your child is motivated by peers, this will be perfect for your youngster. I was happy to see toddlers, pre-schoolers and what looked like even Kindergartners learning to use the potty in this DVD! So my child will see kids she can look up to and for those who learn later in life, they will not feel left out when they see kids their age.I just loved it and so did my little one. I was worried this would not be tastefully done, but it was great! Nothing made me cringe! This was recommended by several other potty training moms in my mother's group - now I am recommending it too! TRY IT! If your little one likes to do after ""seeing,"" - then you'll love this too. My little one is hooked on it. :)"
5,Son Loves Potty Power,My son has been very stubborn and has refused to read or watch anything that has to do with potty training. I bought potty power about a week ago. It got here within 4 days of ordering and my son has been watching it everyday. 2 to 3 times a day. he has yet to show interest in the potty but we have made progress with him watching the video. it is very cute and kid oriented. even grandma and i like to sit and watch it with him. very good buy for a stubborn child..
5,IT WORKS!,"I bought this DVD years ago for my middle son who absolutely refused to even discuss pottying. He got upset everytime we tried. So, I decided to try anything I could. Found this DVD and let him watch it everyday. I didn't talk to him about it, I didn't bother him, just played the dvd everyday for a week. That's all it took. He decided to potty on his own after watching it. I've since lended it to several friends who have had great success with it. Now that I have another child who is getting ready to potty train I'm having to buy a new Potty Power DVD for him since so many people got use of my old one and it was never returned. I like to think it's still out there helping some other parent and child. It's totally worth the money to get a new one. :D"
4,Good Job Good Potty Potty,"We tried a lot of things to help my son learn to be potty trained, and this helped a lot. It is well done and keeps even younger childern's attention. It does not scare them into going(like their is a monster inthe potty that wants to eat your poopy, it makes it a positve experience."
5,Finally interested!!!,"I have tried books, videos (including the episode of Blue's Clues and the episode of Bear In The Big Blue House), talking, and every other non-forceful way I could think of with my almost 3 year old. She ranged from partial disinterest to outright hatred of the potty, depending on the day and her mood. My older children were not this difficult to potty train, so I was becoming increasingly more unsure as to what to try next.After buying this video and having it shipped, she watched it twice in a row and I could barely get her OFF the potty the rest of the day. She told me, ""No more diapers."" and was even singing one of the songs right before she went to sleep. Within less than a week, she was completely potty trained. I'm impressed!"
5,My daughters favorite!,"My daughter will watch this 3 or 4 times a day if I let her. She wants to sit on her potty chair while watching it to try and go herself. It is SO motivating for little ones. She will walk around all day singing the catchy little songs from the movie, and constantly tells me ""No more daipers for me"". I love that it's just simple, and plain. No fancy gimicks...just a sweet, fun lady talking, and some kids that are probably about 3 that you can understand, but look like my 2 year olds size. She loves it!"
1,Boring...,"My son was completely bored within minutes of watching the DVD. I was bored, but it's not meant for me. Didn't motivate him. Didn't do anything at all in regard to the potty. He asked me to turn off the DVD. I'll stick with our Elmo Potty Time DVD. He loves that one. I just thought another DVD with kids using the potty would help more so. Waste of money! Plus, I bought it based upon the reviews. Now I'm hesitate in buying something with such good reviews. This is a bad potty DVD!!!"
5,If there was a 10 Star Rating that's what I would give this,"A wonderful way to introduce your post-toddler child to the potty. It's fun, it's on-message, it's informative, it makes potty training something our son is enthusiastic about doing.The songs in particular are contagious. They're so catchy that they'll infect not only your child but you too. I find myself humming the tunes while feeding lunch etc. The reason this matters is because each song has a central message in the potty process. Kids get it!The whole production is a lot of fun but it's also effective. What a combination! I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone with a post-toddler child who just hasn't shown much interest yet in potty training. This video is a breakthrough waiting to happen. It was for us. Of course there are no guarantees. Your mileage may vary."
5,Great DVD for the potty training experience,"I used this DVD during a 3 day weekend devoted to potty training my 34 month old son. He was interested and entertained; I used it as a ""friendly"" reminder each day. The DVD and the training were a success."
4,FUN for toddlers,"My son loves this video, it helped get him ready for potty training and he loves to sing the songs from the video while he sits on the potty. He loves the underwear song.....his desire to wear his underwear is what I think helped him finish the potty training process. By the way I always skipped the story about the Princess and the Potty.....its for girls."
2,Not so hot,"After watching Elmo's Potty Time for the last few weeks, Potty Power's low-quality production was hard to bear."
1,Hated it!,"The entire content of this video is demeaning and insulting to little ones. I agree with other reviews that it is simply trying to shame kids into going to the potty. It compares going potty to other ""big kid"" things that my 27 month old can't do either; tie her shoes, ride a trike, etc. I also thought there was too much focus on having to do the whole thing by yourself. Maybe that part is more appropriate for pre-schoolers that are still asking for help because it isn't appropriate for toddlers just starting out who will need some help along the way."
1,Disappointing,"I am extremely disappointed in this video. With all of its ""5 star reviews"" I was expecting a lot more. My daughther is 2 and 1/2 and is more interested in the one preview about the planets. The songs aren't that great, it doesn't even show to to use the potty. The woman on there does more time talking to the parents than the kids.It also says there is a princess scene in there but I never saw it, but on the other hand mine glitches so maybe it just got glitched out?I would not recommend this video to anyone, ever."
1,Not worth it,"I have 2 y.o. twins. They could have cared less. The kids in the DVD are older kids, which doesn't help at all. The singing didn't keep their attention, nor did the entire DVD. I hope I can find a better one."
1,Never received product,"I ordered the Potty Power dvd on April 28th. They said it would arrive no later than May 20...well by the 27th, I decided to contact them. No answer back (via email). I was refunded by Amazon. Really disappointed b/c this was a gift that never came and NO ONE contacted me about this!!"
5,Pottin Training DVD,"I bought this DVD for our 3 yr old granddaughter who has resisted potty training until this time. She loved the show. She went around singing the songs, ""no more diapers"" but it didn't help her in the training. She is now 3 1/2 and her parents just got tired and put her in underpants ""cold turkey"". She is now 60 % trained. She is too busy to go. But the DVD did help introduce the subject in a non-threating way and I would recommend it. It is well done and very cute."
3,"Video is good, but a couple of dissappointments.",The video itself is quite good. I would have given it 5 stars if not for these 2 disappointments. Not all kids use a potty chair. I am a daycare provider and a mom of 2 and we use the toddler seats that sit on top of the regular toilet seat. The video teaches kids only about potty chairs. Second disappointment is that I'm training 2 and 3 year olds. The kids in the video are much older (4 to 6 age range).
2,Tried this video for a 2 year old it was terrible,"We bought this video along with the Elmo Potty video and hands down the Elmo one was more engaging and interesting than this video. As we were playing this we both looked at each other and said, this is terrible. Maybe this would be better for older kids 4-5 who are still having problems, our 2 year old was totally not interested in watching this video, we were able to do away with diapers in one weekend mainly with the Elmo video, I would not recommend to anyone, the Elmo however I would recommend."
2,"Entertaining, terrible sound recording","My daughter is afraid to do #2 in the potty, so I am willing to try anything! This video got such great reviews, so I am giving it a try. She likes to watch it, and we talk about ""potty power"" after... exciting to her, but not enough to go #2. I didn't expect the video to solve the problem.Why the 2 rating? The sound recording is SO TERRIBLE! The sound goes up and down throughout and the woman's voice recording is very tinny. The end of the video with the princess is a cute idea, but so cheezy and home video like. The jester is frightening. They should re-cord and give the end a little upgrade with a less scary characters."
3,for older toddlers,"This video is more appropriate for older toddlers (3+) with longer attention spans. One thing I particularly dislike for my younger toddler (then 21 mos., now 25 mos.) is that the video has a ""quiz"" in the beginning which asserts that ""babies"" sleep in cribs, while ""big kids"" sleep in beds. I am very happy with our daughter still sleeping in her crib while simultaneously making progress learning to use the toilet. Like most of these books and videos, this stresses use of a separate potty chair, rather than using the adult toilet with a potty seat insert (one good exception to this generalization is a Dora the Explorer Potty Book with flushing sound button). This video has a ridiculous princess-theme story in the middle and cheesy songs that make an adult's brain cells line up to jump out her ear but they are catchy for children. I give it 3 stars for trying & because it doesn't seem like it could hurt."
