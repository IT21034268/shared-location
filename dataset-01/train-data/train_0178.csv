3,its okay,this is an alright little message that will hopefully change your life. I haven't been able to put 7 days of strict positive thinking together. I hope when I do. it will work for me
1,This is NOT a book but a phamplet,"any message from emmet fox is worth while reading - however:i was very upset when i recieved this book because it wasn't a book at all, but a 9 or 10 page booklet. in addition, it does not contain the seven mental laws. the 7 day challenge is much easier when you know, memorize and practice the mental laws. get the real book MAKE YOUR LIFE WORTHWHILE.it has the 7 mental laws and the seven day challenge and many other messages for making your life worthwhile..this booklet is a waste of your money"
2,How many trees die for this excuse for a book?,"Save your seven dollars. Even with extra-wide margins, the blank pages, and printing the contents twice verbatim there is little to this book that could not have been printed on one sheet of paper.In a nutshell:1. Your present life is the consequence of how you think2. Change the way you think, change your life and environment.3. Don't think negative thoughts.4. If you find yourself being negative, start the ""diet"" over.5. Do this for seven days to create new habits.Not that this isn't good advice but I don't think you need to spend 15 minutes reading this pamphlet or seven dollars to find this out."
1,"Great pamphlet, here it is for free!","[...]This pamphlet is actually in the public domain and can be viewed, downloaded, even printed and distributed free of charge.[...]"
4,A LOOK INTO ANOTHER TIME,"This is a very clever book that gives the reader a look at another time, over two thousand years ago. While not as good as the author's previous historical novel, ""Justanian,"" ""Wine Dark Sea"" is a excellent read. You won't find it in most book stores so order it here, you won't be disapointed! ..."
2,Disappointed,"I have been an electrician for 30 years. I installed 8 of these timers in my own house 5 years ago. Given that I installed them correctly they have worked wonderfully. I have never had one lockup on me. However, I have had 5 fail because the buttons broke off. They appear to rely on a set of very small plastic tabs that retain them against the spring tension. I have found that a tab will break off causing the button to hang crooked then eventually another tab will fail and the whole button will fall off. There is no way to repair short of total switch replacement as Leviton doesn't offer replacement buttons. The frequency of use certainly seems to be a factor as most of the failures are in the rooms most used. However, I think that they have a flawed design or material spec. problem. I recommend that you save your receipt for the warranty claim. Maybe they will get the message. I like the product just wish they would hold up better."
4,works nice.,"Hooked this timer to my bathroom fan. Already had modular style switches so it blends in well with other devices. Installed easily (make sure you have neutral wire available in your box). Works properly. Always left the fan running for a lot longer than I needed, so this was perfect solution. Cost of unit is pretty high, so going to take a long time to recoup cost in utilities savings."
1,"3-wire configuration is common - this switch requires a 4th, neutral wire","A year ago I replaced a fan switch with one of those dial-timer switches which was very easy to install. I thought this switch looked a lot better and the quiet operation sounded great also so I purchased it. According to the manufacturer's website, most new house's electrical systems include a neutral wire configurations and since my house is one year old it did not occur to me check before ordering. My configuration only has a 3-wire setup and without the neutral wire, the timer won't work. One of my friend's is an electrician so I called him and he said that generally only timers for HVAC systems in residential building have a neutral wire setup. So before you order, verify that your existing setup has a neutral wire, because it probably does not."
4,Made in China. Failed in two years. Replacement still running after four years!,"Original review: My Leviton 6230M bathroom timer switch was purchased in February 2006 and survived 2 years of moderate use -- once or twice a day -- before it failed to operate the fan. The LEDs still light up and count down, but there is no juice on the blue switched-output wire so I guess the timer circuit is okay but the relay is fried. Two years is not bad for a switch made in China, I suppose. At the moment I have installed a simple on/off switch while I search for a reliable replacement.Update: After failing to find a viable alternative, I purchased two more of these timer switches (one as a spare) in March 2008. The one I installed has been running well for over 4 years now, and I have yet to use the spare. I have given it three more stars.Note that there is now a newer replacement: http://www.amazon.com/Leviton-LTB30-1LZ-Countdown-Required-Assembled/dp/B002WTC91K/ref=dp_ob_title_hi"
1,Buttons Fall off,After five years of daily use the buttons are starting to pop off. Works well otherwise but must replace. Very disappointing.
5,Leviton timer switch,Great timer; easy to install. Saves on electricity as fan is on a timer and can't be accidently left run all day. We have four of these in our home and haven't had any troubles.
4,Works great,"Installed in a new construction bathroom to control the bathroom fan. Mounted it between the toilet and the shower so it is easy to access from both. Works great. Was a bit hard to fit into the electrical box with the incoming and outgoing wires, but I managed to get it all stuffed in to the largest single gang box sold by the local big box home improvement store."
5,Extremely reliable product,I am writing this review after a couple a years since I have purchased the item and I always said was one of the best investments I made in my house. Extremely happy with this product . I have one installed in each of my bathrooms .
4,Leviton 612-6230-W timer switch Functional but could be better,"The switch works as expected. However, the screws that came with it is cheesy. The head is slotted and different gap than standard slotted screw. I threw them away and got my own. The specification or someplace should've mention that this switch works only for certain wiring. I was lucky to be wired the way that it wants. Power, all three wires, have to go to the switch first then to the fixture for this to work. Make sure this is your wiring before you buy it otherwise the switch won't for you otherwise.Once it's installed, it works great. However, I only had it for a couple of weeks. Hopefully it will last a while."
1,Failed after 1 year,"Works great. No problems after couple months. Its really tough to get this unit in with all the 12 gauge wires of a double gang box like I had. Easy install other than stuffing it all in the box. Not as easy to use in the dark as a regular switch, but LED helps you find it.UPDATE: After exactly one year of normal use in a water closet it failed. IT seems the electronics failed: It will no longer countdown and turn off. The only way to turn off the fan was to reset the breaker. I really loved the look and functionality. But its not built to last, or cannot tolerate power fluctuations. Changed rating down from 5 stars and title was ""Works great""."
1,outdated info,"I'm glad I only paid 50 cents for this. This book is full of crash diets(grapefruits and eggs or tomato and skim milk)and the ""inches off plan"" is just a low fat, no protein diet. There I just saved someone else 50 cents!"
1,Bad item,"Item was sent to us in used condition. The original packaging was missing, the item is damaged and smells and the instruction booklet pages are stuck together. Shame on Amazon to send an used item!"
4,It Serves its purpose,"I wouldn't say this is the best product out there, but for the price it does serve its purpose. I have never been able to get it lowered, eventhough it will, or I should say is suppose to.All in all, I am happy with it. It does keep my son from falling out of bed at night. We have it on a queen sized bed."
3,"""Enya-esque""","The sound is sort of ""Enya-esque"" plus a fiddle. It's got some complicated percussions and soulful vocals all finely arranged around a traditional celtic framework. It is truly a unique Christmas record. I like to play it as background music for Christmas gatherings. Everyone who hears my copy falls in love with it. -I can't wait for the Easter project!"
1,Read these book reviews carefully,"I have only limited contact with the contents of this book - borrowed copies and people I have run into on the road who are using this book. What little I read is enough to make me want to pick up one of the many excellent Moon Handbooks on my next trip to Mexico. Some of the other reviewers site the fact that this book is terribly outdated. I would add that it is over-used... and the hotel owners and waiters whose establishments are listed in the book know it. If you are new to independent travel and have never heard of Taxco or Guanajuato or you want to feel like you are really beating a new path but still want your restaurant menus in English, maybe this book can help. Otherwise, consider one of the amazingly well-researched and up-to-date Moon Handbooks, such as Pacific Mexico, Archeological Mexico, or Colonial Mexico."
2,Very mediocre,"Very uninteresting guide to Mexico. I was shocked to see that Rosarito Beach and Puerto Nuevo were not even in the book.Seems kind of thrown together and not very well organized. Graphics don't stand out well, and info was very hard to find.I don't recommend this book."
3,Feels like an encyclopedia of practical information.,"OK, you'll get tons of practical information with this one, with pages of hotels sandwitched between listings of restaurants and yellow pages of bus lines. But beyond that, this book definitely lacks depth. If you want to learn about Mexican sights and understand their historical or cultural significance, you may want to look at Bruce Whipperman's guides or Alexandra's Travelogues serie."
4,"I have ahouse in jalisco, mexico","I have a house in mexico and travel there 1 or 2 months per year . I also speak spanish less than fluently. I have found the lonely planet guides to be very useful. As with any guide there are mistakes and shortcomings. But overall, these are the best guides for those who whish to travel on a low to medium budget."
5,Expedition 3X stove,"I purchased this stove for camping and hunting. I received it in time to take on my recent hunting trip to N. Central Montana where the weather was very cold (below zero). Because the wind was blowing so hard, we waited until the wind died down and the temp was up around 10F. Set up on the stove was a snap, I installed the two burner grill box and burned off any residual assembly stuff (I pre-cleaned the grates at home). I fired it off again and while I grilled some new york strip steaks and brats, another fellow used the third burner to fry up some hash browns. In spite of the cold temps, we had dinner done in around 15 min. I feel the flame tamers are a necessity for frying pans and coffee pots as it worked great for that purpose."
4,Great BBQ,"We use this monster for camping in our trailer. It's super heavy, but you can tell it's well built. We bought the carrying cases for it and it's griddles so the weight can be better distributed! It cooks the food evenly too."
3,A good read,"Only a Memory Away is a good read for anyone who loves amnesia stories. The prose is smooth and so is the pace. While I found some minor logic questions, I had no trouble following the story. St. Clair does a good job with her setting, and I could easily see all her scenes and characters. She really keeps you hanging right to the very end."
3,Its ok,"I bought 4 copies of this book for my daughter's teachers. I thought it would be a good item for them to remember her by(persian).So, I did not read it, but did browse through it and read some sections. I love the translation. I am a little disappointed about the quality of the paper and binding. Also, I think there should have been some illustrations. Actually, I was expecting illustrations and there are none.It seems to me this is just a cheap re-packaging of the much more expensive collection.S."
3,shahnameh,This is essential reading for those interested in Persian literature. If you like Beowulf and the Song of Roland and such works then you might want to have this. As with most medieval literature it's a little weak on characterization and the endless descriptions of battle scenes gets a little monotonous. For the casual curious reader you might just want to check it out from the library.
1,too much,Twice the price for kindle edition? I'm not looking for $9.99 but I'm sure it costs at least a few dollars to print this. I don't buy books that cost equal or more for paper.
5,question,"Does anyone know if this text is the same as that of the three-volume ""Stories from the Shahnameh"" also by Davis but minus the illustrations, or does it contain additional material not in those three volumes (which are excellent)?"
2,THIS IS NOT THE FULL TEXT,"Before anyone becomes excited that the Shahnameh has finally been made available - don't. It hasn't. This text is not noted as being abridged because it isn't, technically. Instead large swaths of untold length have been summarized in a paragraph or two as, according to the translator, he found them of lesser importance and gosh, the poem is really long. (Actually, the review does say, ""most complete version available"" or something like that. This apparently is meant to be read as 'translator's selection'.)I myself am no great scholar of Persian texts so I will leave a review of what has been included in the text to someone more familiar with the Shahnameh's various versions than myself. My two stars are because I felt like there was no fair warning that this was an abbreviated version."
3,"Great translation and cover design, but the worst book print I have ever seen!!!","When I ordered the book, there was no description on the quality of the printing! I received the book on time; the translation is very good and the cover design is good; however, the paper quality and printing is terrible. The book pages are cut unevenly and inappropriately which gives a really unpleasant appearance to the book and the papers are so low in quality ( they are almost yellow and I believe book papers are supposed to be white)! I need the book for the Haft-sin table and the physical appearance of the book is important to me; however, I don't have enough time to return this book and buy it from another publisher. I recommend you consider another publisher to buy the Shahnameh."
5,Best Translation out there,"A bit pricey, but probably the best translation of the Book of Kings that's out there."
4,Great book for beginners,"It's truncated and written in story form with random poetic inserts, instead of being the long epic poem it is in traditional Farsi. That said, it's great for someone who just wants to read the stories and learn some parts of Persian mythology."
4,A must-read for any Ali fan.,"For a casual boxing fan who's too young to remember Ali, this book might be a little obscure. But for boxing fans of my generation, who grew up on Ali, your boxing library won't be complete without it. Each of the 15 opponents featured here has an interesting story to tell, and the book provides a ton of material for serious boxing historians.What is particularly interesting is how most of these men's lives were profoundly affected by their encounter(s) with Ali. Henry Cooper, for instance, a national hero in the U.K., will still always be best known for a single punch he threw in a fight he lost: the left hook that knocked Cassius Clay (as he then was) on his butt. A few of them regard Ali with love or reverence, a few with indifference, and one, in particular, with undying resentment. Overall, one gets a remarkable education on the human condition by comparing the stories of these 15 very different men. Highly recommended."
4,"untold stories of those who fought ""the greatest""","A great book, adding a perspective on Ali from the least reported angle - namely 15 of his opponents. Most lost, a few knocked Ali down, a few defeated him. All have won or lost the corresponding internal battle they had to fight.the fighters range from well-known and immensely talented boxers (foreman, frazier) to some of the least capable and likely contenders for the title in the history of the sport. All are fascinating, not merely for their perspecitves on Ali, but also for the value of their own stories as minor players in the most turbulent and glorious period in boxing history.Now if these 15 fights were only available on a dvd....."
2,Promise unfulfilled,"The composer Xenakis brings most to mind is George Antheil. Both composers made a huge initial splash. But repeated listening to these pieces reveals that they are little more than empty effect. Although dates of the pieces here span two or three decades, all of the music is rooted firmly in the sixties. There are many composers who experimented with similar textures during this period. But for the best of breed, this kind of music became an important part--but only a part--of a larger toolkit. Without this experimentalism, we'd have never had Ligeti's ""San Francisco Polyphony"" or Lutoslawski's mighty ""Third Symphony"". But Xenakis appears to feel that the effect is the thing. There's not much in this music beyond theatricality.This has often been considered to be groundbreaking music. But it's important to build something after breaking ground. Xenakis has left us an empty lot."
4,Very practical solution,"Very practical solution if you need an outlet where all you have is a bulb.The pull chain is very short, the manufacturer includes a piece of string which you attach to the chain. Not a very good idea because the string expands when you pull it (my review is 4 stars instead of 5 because of this), luckily I found some chain at a hardware store to replace it."
5,Angelic Saengerknaben,"This album is one of the Wiener Saengerknaben's finest hours! Their voices are perfect, surrounded by the vibrant accoustics of the recording location.Accompanied at times by a small chamber ensemble, once by harp, the rest by organ, except for two acapella selections, the carols ring out with all that the Saengerknaben are best known for, crystal clear high notes, perfect intonation, and that rich unbelieveable sound which only the Wiener Saengerknaben can produce. ""Es Wird Scho Glei Dumpa"", ""Adeste Fideles""and Bruckner's ""Ave Maria"" stand out as personal favorites, but all the selections are just as good. ""Stille Nacht"" is simply Heaven come down to earth, exqusite, utterly perfect! This album has not as yet been given the cd realse it so richly deserved, so grab a copy of the Austrian orginal and transfer it to cd. You will NOT be dissatisfied!Froehliche Weichnachten!"
5,Best adaptation...,"This version of Huckeberry Finn is the best one I've seen. I love the older versions of films that were made in the 30s & 40s--and, this one is a classic."
5,Youth adventure story,"It isn't exactly like the book, but few movies are. I enjoyed it a lot, but you should know that it cannot be played on your computer unless it has a read only device."
5,whole family watched,"I bought this for my family. We have four children ages 17-10 and we all watched it-even though it was in black and white. The movie is a classic and although many years old still made my children laugh. It also made them think about issues that are hard to imagine now...like, kids didn't wear shoes? ;)"
1,Read,"I don't advocate this much, but when you compare the novel and this movie, I would say go read the book. This book leaves out and alters so much of the story that it completely changes the meaning of the book. Omitting the Tom Sawyer sequence at the end is a complete crock. When Peter Jackson set out to make the Lord of the Rings, yes, he had to cut much out in order to not make 3 different four-hour long movies, but he didn't decide ""Ok, let's change it from 'The Ring being destroyed' to 'Indians do a dance and then tell a story about how the White Man took his land'."" Someone wrote that it shouldn't matter if it doesn't follow the book exactly. This is a case where it changed just about every possible aspect from the book just enough to be able to still call it Huck Finn. In fact, I could promise that just about the only two things from the book that were not altered in at least one blasphemous way were the title and the character's names."
2,It was an okay movie.,"I think this book was very boring . But the movie was alittle better. I wish that he had published some better book than the ones that he has out.Mark Twain is a very creative man and I admire that. Recently i had visited his house in Conneticut. It was really nice and I enjoyed myself. Otherwise , the my most favorite book would have to be Tom Sawyer because it was an exciting aventure. Iy was also nice how he put Tom Sawyer as a continuation in Huck Finn Book, eventhough I thought that book was really boring. So to all the readers out there I would just like to say watch the movie and not read the book you will enjoy it more."
3,Interesting,The Miracle of Language was an interesting book which detailed the history of language and how and why it developed that way. Charlton Laird uses an easy to understand manner when giving relevant examples to support his facts. This book is somewhat outdated but is certainly a must read for the language enthusiast.
5,Wish I'd been In Tampa to Watch Walter Trout Live,From the moment I put the headphones on I felt I was in the crowd feeling the Walter Trout electric atmosphere. I have all his cd's and this is Walter at his best taking the guitar to great heights. Introduced on the first track and into a earth shattering start to send tingles down the spine and send adrenaline racing.He hits home his music with great energy throughout the CD showing why he is king of the guitar. How does he make his guitar talk to an audience in so many ways? After this CD and seeing Walter Trout Live already I won't be staying home when hes in my neighbourhood. Great CD.
3,Not bad,"Great guitar player, did not have anything by him before so decided to buy this. It's good but mostly flash compared to the greats who had or have the substance to go with the flash."
3,Slow down dude,"I finally picked up a W.Trout cd after years of reading about him. He is no doubt a talented guitarist. My problem is, (and I know most will say WHAT), I think he continually plays too fast. After awhile its like the solos all just blend together into one long blur. I really don't care for his vocals either. I think the best song on the album is Walking in the Rain. Great riffs and tone. To me there is only one heir to the throne of SR Vaughn and he is............Jimmy Thackery. Pick up Sinner Steet or Drive to Survive. Both are awesome...."
4,"Walter ""shreds"" the blues!","From the opening slew of licks to the last note, this live performance is top-notch. Players like Trout show that the blues is by no means dead, and he proves it in this performance. This man is more then just a guitar player that plays fast-he is an emotional guitar player, that plays with feeling, and he might play fast, but it sounds good, and has feeling.The vocals, however, aren't that great, but they're not that bad either. They're just no where, I mean nowhere, as good as his guitar playing. Walter Trout, Tommy Castro, Scott Holt-these are guys that keep blues guitar alive."
5,One of Cain's Best-- Completely Unclassifiable,"Everyone should read three James M. Cains: ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemnity,"" and ""Serenade."" His writing reached its peak with these three. The first two are hard-boiled and terse and nasty, and they move like bullets to their sordid ends. But ""Serenade"" is almost lyrically operatic, in keeping with the soap opera that is the protagonist's love life. This tremendously forward-looking and unpredictable (and brief and economical) book melds a number of Cain's loves into a tapestry of nearly ludicrous proportions. Read it! You won't be disappointed."
2,"a very strange, ..and not very good..., effort by James M. Cain","'Serenade' is one of the oddest books I've read, and unfortunately it is not among the author's better efforts. Although quite readable and, at fleeting moments, very interesting I found 'Serenade' to be a rambling mess. The characters were not well developed, or believable, and the plot was absolutely ludicrous. I think it would be merciful for fans of James M. Cain, and indeed mankind, to let 'Serenade' and his equally miserable 'The Butterfly' go quietly out of print.Oh, let me add some words about the plot. We have a washed up American opera star trying to scratch a living in Mexico, circa 1935. He meets a prostitute, falls in love, then brings her back to America. Miraculously his voice is restored to Caruso-level brilliance. Oh, they then run into misadventure. And we also discover our opera star had a homosexual dalliance with a rich British promoter. Shock, horror, boredom.Bottom line: a real mess."
2,Some great songs but not worth buying the cd for,"only 5 songs worth anything the rest is all noise. 2 of them are well knowns played millions of times, Walk Away, funk #49The REAL burners on is this are, Laguna Salada, Country Fever, and the best song of all is ""You're going to need me, Live"" oh man! if your only going to buy one song, this is it!!"
5,One of the best cd's ever,"Even though this is a greatest hits cd, it probably has songs you have never heard if you're not a huge James Gang fan already. I have a very large music collection and this cd is one I pull out a lot. It has The Bomber, which is one of the best songs ever- for real. This is a cd you'll want to take with you camping, listen to with friends, drink a beer, reminisce, dance, clean house, etc.. if you are any kind of music lover you must own this cd."
3,good compilation,"better to buy this than the ""Gang's"" albums... they were not prolific once Joe went solo - so this is the best way to get some good gang songs"
2,James Gang - Greatest Hits,"There were some good moments, but only a few. Honestly, I think the CD is mis-titled. There were only 3 legitimate hits. Oh well, sometimes you'll have that."
4,Connection with biographies,I enjoyed this novel because it pulled charactors and history from two previously and recently read biographies: The Orientalist and Them. The novel provided the fictional twist or color commentary to the historical events of the other two books. Good read.
2,"It works, but durability can be an issue","I bought this product prior to Officer Candidate School 3 years ago. It worked great though over time (6 months) the hinges began to wear. Eventually they broke and the lid would no longer stay shut and it had to be replaced. In future I will purchase a soap holder with a slide on top and not one that is hinged (of course, my dad bought a hinged design exactly like this one back in the 1970s when he was a junior officer and it still works to this day)."
5,this soap holder cost about 3 bucks w/shipping!!,"i couldn't believe it till i recieved it in the mail. it apparentlly only comes in yellow, but it has 3 hinges instead of just 2!! so it should last longer. they really should advertise the 3 hinge part, they'd probly sell more! to bad there aren't more color choices."
1,Coghlan's Soap Holder,"What a waste of money, I wanted the soap holder with a rope. I could have bought this trash at the dollar tree @ 3/$1.00"
5,Excellent Customer Service,"I purchased a coffee table that was out of stock. They found a replacement for me at the same price that works beautifully (I would have picked it first, had I seen it). They went out of their way to communicate with me about the problem and acknowledge my response. The table arrived far sooner than I was expecting and the price is very reasonable. I highly recommend Cross County Furniture and will use them again in the future."
1,Requiem for a Miserere,"Sarti's music is kind of a miracle: light and melodious. The kind Mozart would not have denied. But let in Placci's hands, it becomes a nightmare for the listeners. The orchestra is going apart as if each and every player was willing to play his own way. The soloists and chorus are not singing, they are yelling. It's a shame to dare recording such massacre, which Sarti does not deserve. As a world premiere recording, it undoubtedly is...for the worst performance."
3,"Not a Bad Book, but doesn't have a niche","This slim volume, an expansion from an American Family Physician journal article, attempts to come up with essentially a ""bare bones"" exam - a process that could be completed within a time-pressed patient visit (and what patient visit is NOT time pressed). I believe that it accomplishes what it sets out to do, but it really doesn't add anything new to your existing exam. I learned a few things from this book, but almost everything is either in your physical examination book or neurology book. It perhaps would make a nice pocket book, except it isn't pocket sized. In conclusion, not a bad book to read through once, but I am not sure if it is worth buying."
3,"Very concise, but not comprehensive enough","I'd say it's somehwere between 3 and 4 start.This is nice for a very brief review, but leaves a lot of common diagnosises out. I found Neuro examination made easy to be a better review. That said, I do like the full body picks with symptoms where you have to guess the diagnossis and then it gives the answer and explains why. They are very basic, but get the point across well. Would make for good test questions"
1,Not what I expected at all,Adult sized is debatable...the shirt didn't even fit my 12yr old son. He had to wear his last year's costume because he felt ridiculous in this costume. Poor quality mask and shirt. :(
4,correctous,great piece for lovers of the kenshin series. the dialogue could ve been better though. good video quality. glad i bought it. will treasure it.
5,FUNNY!!!!!!,The episodes start off with sano and siato going at it with siato's rude quips and sano's funny facial exsressions. Sano meats Cho the sword hunter and they are already make fun of eachother in one of the most funny scenes sano has ever been in.
5,a MUST for children of any age!,"I remember listening to this album (then on cassette tape - remember those?) while I was growing up. It's a fantastic set of songs that every child will love. As a teacher now, I realize the importance of the rhyming words, repeated rhythms, and even many play-on-words and puns that are included in the song lyrics. These songs stay with you and teach children simple, interesting ideas (like singing while finding your ""other"" missing shoe or differentiating between other ""buttons"" and your own belly button!), which is why I highly recommend this fun-filled cd for every family!"
1,still no trace,"I am not happy with this product, yet, since I don't have it, yet. Ordered on July 13th. It's now August 15th, and still no trace of the cd. Hopefully it will arrive, and when it does i will write a review of this product."
5,Best Kids CD Ever!,"Hands down, this is the best kids music ever! Our son is now 26 & we had this on cassette tape when he was young. He loved to sing, dance & laugh along with these tunes. I, too, had never forgotten the adorable songs on this tape & was so glad to find it again on CD for recent baby gifts. You can't go wrong with choosing this for your own child or as a gift - it's absolutely delightful!"
5,Great Fun!,"We got this music when my daughter was five years old, and as her Mom, I've enjoyed listening to it as much as she has! She is now seven, and she still enjoys listening. It's fun music, the lyrics are clear and easily memorized, and these are just songs that every young child should have the opportunity of hearing."
5,So Much Fun!,"I teach Pre-kindergarden at a private school and my classes of kids for the last three years have loved this music. I play it anytime of the day and they have so much fun with the ""Late Last Night"" and ""Wiggle in my Toes"" songs. I have been checking this tape out of my public libary, and now I'm so glad I can have my own to keep."
2,Sympathetic but not helpful,"While the author clearly understands what we ex-pats go through, she does not offer much in the way of substantial suggestions for making it all go better. I came away feeling like a good cup of coffee with the girls would have been just as helpful. There are a few pearls of wisdom, like thinking about how endings have affected you in the past and how that can add insight to frightening feelings that may surface during the repatriation period. But at the end of the day, this book is a list of reasons why you might be leaving your post (don't we already know that?) and much repeating of the need to give yourself time to readjust. There was not much meat here to be honest. I was disappointed."
4,Works good,"Switch and outlet are close to each other, yet sometimes it takes a couple of presses to get it to turn on or off. No big deal to me - I'm just glad I didn't have to cut holes in the wall :)"
2,Very faulty switch...,"I purchased two of these switches. One, thus far, has operated quite well. The other had problems ""out of the box."" Removing the face plate screws proved to be a challenge. Apparently one of the screws was so tightly fastened into threaded brass ferrule that the ferrule actually ""spun"" in the plastic receiver that was holding the brass ferrule into which the faceplate screw was fastened. This necessitated the removal of the faceplate by ""coaxing"" it off the switch box faceplate mounting screws. Then, after remedying this solution, the switch operated properly for two days, and then commenced to function properly only sporadically. I returned it for credit. For me, a 50% reliability doesn't cut it."
2,Choose another brand,"I have two of these remote switches , but they're made by Westek. They are about the same price, but much better quality. The only reason I went with a different brand was because I needed three different frequencies and could not find the ""F"" frequency made by Westek. (The have D, E and F)The on/off switch on this one just doesn't feel right and it's not as responsive as the Westek. The major problem with this one, though, is that it would not work at certain angles. It only worked when plugged into the same wall as the switch. The other thing that bugged me is that the switch has this ugly, large ""ON OFF"" sticker on the switch. I peeled it off and it left a sticky residue that was almost impossible to remove. It took nail polish remover followed by a magic eraser."
4,Works pretty well,"Sometimes you have to push twice to get it to turn on or off. It's also a bit annoying that the outlet is on the bottom if you wanted to put in something like a night light, since it will be facing the wrong way. It does make the attachment nicer for normal cods, though.Pretty good fit and finish, though."
1,Wrong form factor!,"The description says: ""It easily replaces a single- pole switch and fits into a standard wallbox."" This is not true. It doesn't fit in a standard wallbox and cannot be used at all in a ganged box. The picture of the item is rather misleading since the product is not just a wall plate with a decora switch. The whole assembly actually sticks out from the wall. Very disappointing, since this could easily have been created in the right form factor.Returned product immediately."
3,Perfect solution for adding a light,"My older home doesn't have overhead lights in every room. This has been a great solution, however I do wish that you could purchase additional separately plugs (for adding a second light), rather than having to purchase an entire set (plug and switch).In terms of performance, though, I have zero complaints."
3,Unfortunate Formfactor,"It works exactly as it says it does. However, the transmitter does NOT replace an existing switch in a wall box. So now, it sits on the coffee table. Happily switching the light on and off."
3,"Great concept, but isn't 100 percent reliable :(","I received the anywhere switch quickly, and installation was extremely easy. My only concern with the item is that it doesn't always work! Most of the time it functions properly, however sometimes the switch won't turn the lights off! (It always works to turn on, just not off) It's a mystery to me why there are signal issues, but for me it was still worth the hassle. We discovered that when the light switch doesn't turn the light off we can get it to work again by flipping the channel on the plug from A to B and back again to A. (Channel B didn't work well) Not great, but it is only about 25% of the time, and we barely use this light so it's not a huge deal for us. This would be a fantastic product if it worked flawlessly!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought two of these so I could have a switch on both sides of the room. Initially, everything seemed ok. Then, I frequently had to press the ON several times for the light to turned on. Eventually, it didn't work at all. I switched to Channel B and everything was fine. For a week. Then, the lights started turning off at random times unexpectedly. Now, if I turn the lights on, with a second or two it, they turn off. So I tried the other plug in module. Turning on is an iffy thing. Levitan usually makes reliable products: most every switch and outlet in my house is Levitan. But this Anywhere Switch is a real disappointment. It's not worth anything if it doesn't work reliably 100% of the time. As a follow up, I did go down to the big box hardware store and bought a similar product for $15. So far, it works exactly as it should."
3,A but not B,"I ordered 2 switches with receivers for use in 2 different locations. The switches and receivers work well on the ""A"" channel, but when the switch and receiver are set to the ""B"" channel the light will turn on but will not turn off. Both locations are near enough to each other that one switch will turn on the lights in both locations."
1,Remote switch doesn't work,Remote switch doesn't work. I tried various positions for the antenna still the remote switch doesn't work. It is waste of money.
2,"Should read, 'Solicitation for Zimmerman Lehman'","I was very disappointed for having PAID for this...it is obviously a vehicle for Zimmerman Lehman to market their services. Additionally, the information given in the solicitation material is extremely superficial. I found much more valuable information about nonprofit board governance, duties and responsibilities in books such as Curtis P McLaughlin, The Management of Non-Profit Organizations, HD62.6.M39 or James P. Gelatt Orys, Managing Non-Profit Organizations in the 21st Century, HD 62.6.G44 1992."
5,Brief but a valuable starter,This booklet covers pertinent information for all new board members. It is brief but offers insite into the information one should be thinking about for directing a board or participating in a board. It helps to stimulate further questions and study.
2,Marketing Crime,"I think charges could be brought against Alessandra for this offering. He banks heavily on the statistical knowledge that very few people who buy this kind of book ever read beyond the second chapter. Therefore, the first two chapters and the cover are merely razzle-dazzle fluff constantly mentioning ""charisma,"" but rarely saying much about it. He then offers a weak thesis that charisma is related to communication then proceeds to stuff the rest of the book with what is obviously old material on the subject of communication occasionally tying it to charisma. This ""filler"" material, I will say, is solid stuff, but, overall, this book, as well as Mr. Alessandra, are very disappointing."
4,Very Informative,"This book was very informative on ways to work on portraying oneself as being a outgoing, energetic, and charismatic person. I have read many books on Charisma and this is a very good book to start with. It looks at each aspect of Charisma separately, gives you a quiz to take to rate yourself on that aspect, and then goes about explaining how to become more magnetic in each of those aspects. If you're looking for ways to become more outgoing and charismatic then this would be a good book to start with."
2,"Big Promise,Little Delivery","This would be an excellent book on how to make an effective presentation.The problem is that the author fails to deliver the big promise of imparting charisma to the reader,which is what the book is supposed to accomplish.The author would like you to believe that anyone can have charisma,which is like saying that anyone can be a mathematician.Despite what the author says,not anyone can develop reasonable charisma,but if he had been honest he wouldn't have sold nearly as many books.People would be much better off if they better developed the tremendous abilities that they had rather than try to cultivate qualities that are hard to reach or don't exist at all.Another big lie in this genre."
4,A surprisingly useful and insightful read,"Since I ordinarily despise ""self-help"" books, it took me a while to get around to opening this one up...but when I did, I was surprised at the thoughtfulness and clarity of the content. The author (or writer) is down-to-earth and a lot of the advice is actually useful. I thought the approach was a bit westernized in that the definition of ""charisma"" was definitely rooted in our own culture, but that part wasn't a surprise. Overall, I think there is valuable advice in this book, particularly in the area of communication. If you're in a business where image projection and communication are important, you'll probably find this book valuable."
1,More Management Advice,"This book has nothing to do with charisma and everything to do with selling and management. If you want to learn how to sell cars or inspire your secretary, go ahead and get this book. If you want to sway crowds with your powerful words, look elsewhere. And no, I haven't found the book that teaches that yet."
5,One thing you can't do in heaven.,This was absolutely fantastic. It would have to be one of the best books I have read. Very very inspiring and helpful.
2,wrong focus,"Cahill focuses heavily on the afterlife as the reason why people should accept Christ.He doesn't focus enough on how Jesus changes people in THIS life here on earth; how we can have a blessed relationship with him on earth. Rather, his tool for evangelism is: tell people they need jesus or else they will not go to heaven.Great writing style doesn't mean great content"
4,Heaven,"I ordered this book for my brother who is in prison. We have not discussed the book, so I do not know what he thinks about it or what it is actually about."
2,Get a real pet thermometer,"In the past I've had occasion to use this Pet Temp. The last time I used it on one of my cats (a couple of weeks ago), the cat's behavior told me he was sick but the Pet Temp said ""normal."" I took him to the vet anyway and sure enough he was running a temperature. The Pet Temp has given me so many erroneous readings that I finally decided to buy a real pet thermometer (just like the one the vet uses). The vet remarked that he's compared the Pet Temp's readings with the ones generated by his thermometer and he said the Pet Temp is unreliable. That's good enough for me."
1,The songs are not the same as the TV show.,Don't get this if you are expecting the songs to sound the same as the TV show. We were expecting something different.
4,HUMM,"The CD was not what I expected. The CD was in great shape from the supplier, but the CD was not the usual barney singing, I felt the CD had the grown-ups singing instead of the barney or childrens voices you hear. My 1 year old does not even listen to it."
5,Great 60's Hits,"Superb & generous selection of CAMEO-PARKWAY Labels Greatest Hits of the 60's. Sound quality is great. I chose this CD over the box set because I didn't want all those non-hit songs on the box. This has nearly everything I needed. The only song that's missing that I want is Bobby Rydell's FORGET HIM, which was a huge hit & still gets played today. Other than that hearing all these great songs combining R&B, rock and roll, ballads & show bizzy swing like VOLARE by Rydell, which really swings is well worth owning! I never had ANY of these songs on record or CD, so these hits by THE ORLONS, THE DOVELLS, CHUBBY CHECKER, QUESTION MARK, BOBBY RYDELL, and more is a time capsule of 60's pop released at last."
5,Love this movie!,This is an excellent werewolf movie....gives you the chills. Also makes you think twice about staying out in the woods..... The movie is about a married writer who decides to take some time off out at a country cottage....who gets a little more than rest! Scary...dont watch in the dark.....
3,The 2ND best in the series,"I love horror movies point blank!..It's just my thingone of the things i love doing the most is following up on squealsI must say The Howling IV is the best in the series after the first onenone of the other parts have that creepy ,grim feeling that the first Howlinggave us Part 2 is just garbage Part 3 i own it but have not took the time tosee it Part V is the only one that's good enough to stand by part 4Howling VI:The Freaks sucks the big one & new moon rising i can't find anywhere.The Howling 4 sets out to capture the first film , a writer who as a nervousbreak down heads out to the country with her husband to relax and enjoysome days off but it quickly turns into a nightmare when see starts to hear howling outside her window and gets involve in solving a local mysterywhen all is said and done this movie is worth a watch and worth the buy"
1,The Howling IV:The Original Nightmare.,"With Each sequel Howling gets worst and worst and worst, and less scarier and more boring. oh well."
1,These are the Days of our livesssssnore............,"Do you like soap opera acting for 2 hours? Do you like countless dream sequences in slow motion? Do you not like seeing any werewolves in your werewolf movies, well then. This is for you! Please don't listen to these other reviews saying"" Oh this is so much like the the book, or this is so under appreciated"" If this is like the book, then thank goodness I never read it! I enjoyed the first three Howling movies, which had their own charm in different ways. The original just had really cool werewolves, the second had Christopher Lee ,and cool gothic architecture(plus Sybal Danning ,wink wink) the third had alot of humor,and that strange Australian sensability to it, but this? Come on there is nothing to this movie but words,words,words,words,words,then two minutes of werewolves. I love b movies, I love schlock, the was just too dull for me. Yes the end is okay, but be sure to rent this one before you buy. I wish I had."
2,WHERE ARE THE WEREWOLVES??????,"WHERE ARE THE WEREWOLVES IS WHAT I KEPT ASKING THROUGH OUT THIS MOVIE,,I THOUGHT THE ORIGINAL HOWLING AND HOWLING 3 WERE GREAT, THIS ONE JUST DON'T MEASURE UP,BORING BUT WATCHABLE, ALSO WHO DESIGN THE BACK COVER???????WHOEVER DID, DIDN'T DO THEIR HOMEWORK, BECAUSE ALL THE PICS ARE FROM HOWLING 3."
1,"This movie is an ""Original Nightmare""","This movie was boring from start to finish. It was devoid of any special effecta and devoid of talent. I beseech everyone to save their money. ""Nightmare"" indeed!"
3,A decent movie,The first Howling was the best but this is a good one to own if you like having the collection of a Franchise!3 out of 5 stars for me
2,Worst Werewolf Movie Ever!!,"The only good thing about this movie is my all-time favorite singer, Justin Hayward from the Moody Blues, sings ""Something Evil, Something Dangerous"" during the opening credits. That's all."
1,Beyond bad,"The fourth entry into the Howling series finds that after three films the series had already outstayed it's welcome. The story is similar to that of the original film, involving a colony of werewolves that has one thing on their mind. Howling IV: Original Nightmare, isn't original in the least, and despite some solid makeup effects, nothing can save the film from the atrocious acting (from Romy Windsor and Pretender's Michael T. Weiss) lackluster directing, and predictable story. It's a terrible film, but believe it or not, there would be more Howling films on the way after this, which would get even worse! Do yourself a favor, skip every Howling sequel and stick with Joe Dante's original tongue-in-cheek classic, because no Howling film after that is even worth seeing."
1,This movie sucked !!!!!,The best part of the movie was when you get to see the shopkeep naked . Otherwise dont buy this film unless your collecting the Howling series .
3,Spoken Here,"I was required to purchase this book for my global languages class, very long strung out chapters with irrelevant information."
2,Abley Just Can't Pull It Off,"How wonderful a book dealing with the impact of language death on speakers of all the world's languages could have been. Unfortunately, Mr. Abley's odd, irrational fear and mistrust of linguistics and linguists has done him, and his book, a grave disservice. Maybe if Mr. Abley had taken the time to better acquaint himself with a few linguistic basics instead of dismissing all of linguistics wholesale, he might have created a more lucid and coherent account of a truly important subject."
5,A Good Read,I can't comment on the accuracy of the translation but I liked the easy to read style and the supplemental maps that helped place events and travels in context.
3,Intresting....,"Not a perfect translation, but a useful paraphrase of the New Testament that will stir your mind, and hopefully reveal the ""the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."" (2 Cor. 4:6)"
3,jb phillips,"The book was very worn, but it was meant for information so I have another translation. So, it that sense it is good. Just seem more worn then described, but will do."
1,NOT HAPPY,THIS BOOK CAME TO ME WITH A BROKEN BINDING AND WAS IN HORRIBLE SHAPE. I WAS GOING TO USE AS A GIFT WHICH I COULD NOT DO BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE IT WAS IN. IT WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VERSION THEN THE PICTURE THAT WAS SHOWN. VERY DISAPPOINTING.
1,New Testament in Modern English,This is a simple book and is not much like The Bible. One would find it hard to fine a book/verse as it is written more in pargraphs. And there are key verses missing. My copy went into the recycle bin.
5,Great translation,"Phillips had some great insight to the Greek, and I appreciate his translation of the original text into (near-) modern words."
5,Still the All-Round Best Available New Testament in English,"Canon Phillips has chosen to tread that very thin line bordering mainstream ""orthodox"" Christianity and the more liberal ""advanced"" thinking of apologists like Andy GausThe Unvarnished New Testament, Hugh J. SchonfieldThe Original New Testament: A Radical Translation and Reinterpretationand myselfEssential Bible Wisdom: GOOD NEWS by John, the Beloved Disciple, and John, the Elder. Of course, there are still murmurings on the far right and Canon Phillips is never likely to be accepted by Fundamentalists. But for those who wish to steer a middle ground between rival camps (or simply those Christians who are content with their own mainstream beliefs and don't really wish to get involved with factions on either the right or the left), the Phillips translation is ideal."
4,Understanding the Word of God,"The 400 year old King James Authorised Version of the scriptures has been and will always be a wonderful exposition of the Word of God and is the version I will always cherish and adhere to.""New Testament in Modern English"" gives clarification of the more difficult to understand passages of the AV."
5,Interesting Translation,The Phillips translation of the New Testament makes for a good source if you don't understand what the Bible says. At times I found he put his own thoughts into it rather than what the original text says but all in all this translation makes for a good handy reference.
2,"It was such a good idea, too!","Oh, what an attractive idea... finish a worthwhile sewing project in an afternoon. But the follow-through falls very far short of the concept. The so-called step-by-step photos are very unclear. There are text references to points 1, 2, 3 in the photos and the photos have no numbers. (See ""Bob's Bias Tape Maker"").Plus, why in the world would a round gathered bag need grommets if this is a shortcut book? I gave the book two stars because (1) the intention is a great one, and (2) the large photographs of the finished projects are beautiful. Almost made it, but alas, didn't ring the bell."
1,No whiz at gathering information.,"How can you trust an author who can not even get his information correct? The pages available for review talked about a boy growing up on the treeless tundra of Fairbanks, Alaska.Well I live in Fairbanks and it is a green leafy town that is surrounded and filled by millions of trees, birch, chokecherry, willow, black and blue spruces as well as cottonwood trees. and several rivers and hot springs. Those are surrounded by hills and then mountains. He was writing totally away from reality!I then went to the library and found other erroneous parts of the book. With this type of sloppy writing, how can you treat it as anything more then hearsay?"
2,Far from being a good book,"I can recognize Dan Verton really did a lot of researching for writing this book but, despite all of it, it's a bad book. Excepting HD Moore I never saw any of those hackers interviewed. The tales are very unintersting. A mom from a friend of mine liked it and probably my mother will."
2,"Not Much New Here, Hardly a Breakthrough Title.","I have read plenty of books on this topic and this one contains nothing that hasn't been regurgitated in the countless other titles. Hackers are an interesting breed and this title does not adequately explore why they do what they do. It isn't as simple as the author makes it out to be.If you are looking for a breakthrough title that presents some new, startling information, keep looking because you haven't found it here. Aside from that, the book is of average quality. It isn't poor, but at the same time there isn't anything exceptional about it."
5,A great book to read...and great place to order from!,My book arrived sooo quickly I was shocked and extremely pleased. I would highly recommend ordering from them.
1,Parenting a Child With Seneory Processing Disorder: A Family Guide to Understandiung & Supporting Your Sensory-sensitive Child,"I found some usefuly information in this book and have shared one chaper with my sons' Kindergarten teacher. In general I found this book very dry and hard to read, I kept falling asleep reading it no matter when I tried to read it. It just did not flow and keep my attention nor did it read like a text book, it just was not for me and I would not recommend it. I would like to offer I have read about 15 books on sensoery integration so I was knowledgable in this subject matter, maybe to a person just starting the sensory issues it would be better suited."
5,Best Book Out there on SPD,"Great author who offers many perspectives on raising a child w/ special needs. I will read this one over and over, and will make sure my husband and parents read it, too. Every aspect of life is considered; it informs you, challenges you, and inspires! A must read for anyone who has a child with SPD or any similar ""diagnosis""."
2,"Disappointing, too little about parenting","I expected this book to focus more on parenting. Instead, it primarily talks about sensory processing disorder. There are a lot of books that do that. It does have good info about SPD, but not nearly enough about parenting for me. Sensational Kids (by Miller) actually has more helpful tips."
4,Good for being stationary,"First of all, for the $3 i payed for it, I can't really complain about anything.I bought the flag to put on my wall, and it does that perfectly.There are 2 holes on one side of it that you can attach to whatever you like.The material is pretty cheap, but I had no need to touch it all the time, and It is sitting in a closed room, so it there aren't any elements to wear it down.If you want to put the flag on a small pole or something like that, it might be better to look for one with a sleeve on the side."
3,money's worth,"For the price it was worth it. Quailty, very thin, didn't hold up well on a windy day!"
5,Great Flag!,Once again another fine quality flag for the price and size. You will not be disappointed with the Isreal National Flag. Put it on proud display along with your Christian Flag.
4,Poly 3x5 Israel Flag,"Good flag. Slightly see-thru, but if that's a problem, you probably want a cotton flag."
1,Israel Flag,I choose this rating because one of the flags was ripped. I thought the flags shouldn't have been so thin. I had ordered other flags and they were of better quality
5,Love It!,Hangs out nicely and soft fabric. I live by a school and I could hear many talking about it. Lovely flag and great service!
4,Good flag for the money,"This isn't the best made flag Ive owned but for the 6 bucks I paid for it I can put one up each year, and I do. This is the second one I purchased in two years and it stays outside all year round. It's a get it!"
4,"GLoWEAR Class 2 Economy Vest,",This is a nice Visibility Safety Vest for riding at night. Has plenty of stripes to be seen. Cheap too.
4,Good product,"I bought this for my husband as his line of work requires he wears it constantly.I do not see it much, but in over a year we have not had the need to get a new one so I will guess the workmanship of this product must be good."
5,"Recovering from Sexual Abuse, Addictions, and Compulsive Behaviors: ""Numb"" Survivors","This book opened the door for a patient in therapy to feel and understand how childhood abuse affected her. She has suffered from prescription drug abuse and alcoholism most of her life. She was particularily able to connect with the ""Numb"" aspect of her illness."
2,Simple Visions was it for me.,"I bought this for 99 cents in the cut out bin. I absolutely loved ""Simple Visions"" and can't understand why it wasn't played or hyped more. Guess I was the only one....lol. All the rest were ordinary (Only Want my Love, Papal and Close), but the rest of the songs absolutely stunk. But, to me, ""Simple Visions"" was a monster and was worth the 99 cents....easily! Therefore 2 stars for that song alone."
3,r mid-late 1970ies folk rock,album good for about 4 to 5 cuts which remind me of earlier versions of the strawbs with their unique sound and energy. a couple of fillers okay and a couple of others that don't fit my expectations of this group.
4,check this out!,"All I knew about this title was that it was an Italian horror film. I'm glad I took a chance on this DVD, because Creatures From The Abyss (AKA Plankton) turned out to be a hoot. From the bad dubbing and inane dialog, to the cheezy, but fun SPFX, this one reminded me of later films by Lamberto Bava (Graveyard Disturbance, Prince of Terror) and Lucio Fulci (Ghosts of Sodom, Zombie 3). The plot is simple: 5 kids out for a good time take refuge on a deserted ship, where they soon discover mutant plankton, which attack them one by one. Some of the effects reminded me of Carpenter's The Thing, but much more crude. So grab a six pack and enjoy. THIS ONE'S ONLY FOR THE MOST TOLERANT ITALIAN HORROR FANS! you'll love it."
2,had some and lil more action to the end...,"needed more action and creature action, longer creature closeup time. kinda fake and dumb movie. i like the flying fish and grosse creature stuff later. they could have made this picture more fun and interesting tords the end somehow."
1,Dont Deal with JAFRUM! Customer Beware,"Jafrum provides the worst customer service. They are eager to take your money and make promisses to get your business, but if you have aproblem and need to return a product they will find any excuse why its not the products fault but the customers and try to get more money out ofyou. There response time in handling complaints is horrible, instead of the promissed 5 days expect 3 weeks. They will delay your return hopingyou will forget or go away then make up a story which isnt true and deny your warranty on the item. I paid $5 to ship my item back to them forwarranty for an item that went bad in 6 months, after rejecting my warranty they said I have to pay the $15 If I want them to ship my item back.Stay away this company should be closed down for their horrifficcstomer service!"
3,okay,"It's okay, bigger than I thought it would be, but it works. Nothing wrong with it, just not exactly what I wanted."
3,Screen too small,I love this Nav with all of the features and PC interface. But the screen is too small for me to see so I had to give it to my son.
1,too complicated to use,"this was very hard to use, the seller was great and refunded my money upon its return"
3,Functional,"This thing works as advertised. A bit clunky, sensitive to vibration, and lacking style; but it gets the job done."
3,KEEP THE PACKAGING,I bought 2 of these. And yes they look so old. But one worked perfectly. The other is very sparatic and tends to turn off after 5 minutes of being on. very fustrating because I threw away the packaging.
1,Unfortunately appears to be a Leviton knock-off,"Can't be certain, but this appears to be a knock-off and not really made by Leviton. After a phone call to Leviton, and being told this item 6697-I is no longer being made, Leviton's packaging is green and blue with white writing.There were a few other indicators that this may not be OEM, like the crudely cut off drinking straws included as battery sleeves, but I doubt this seller even knew they are selling counterfeit product.Never installed. Still sitting in the packaging."
3,"Excellent music, mediocre recording","Although the drama on stage was disappointing, Muti and the vocalists create terrific music. It is unfortunate that the recording quality is only mediocre. Furthermore, the stage lighting was inappropriately dim for capturing the opera on tape, and most of the scenes are excessively gloomy. All in all, this performance fails to demonstrate the strengths of the DVD format."
2,A dark and often dismal 'Don',"Disappointing -- buying the cheapest version is not always wise. The biggest problem is that the darkness and distance of the view serve to destroy all or most dramatic intensity. The single highlight -- for me and seemingly for those present in the audience: Gruberova singing Donna Anna's ""Non mi dir."" But only a true ""collector"" would buy a DVD just for that."
2,A waste,"Don Giovanni is by far one of my favorite operas, so when I saw this DVD I bought it immediately. Big disappointing. The video quality is old-fashioned TV, illumination too dark. The most disappointing part was not technical, but artistic; in the scene when the Comendatore comes to Don Giovanni's house (my favorite scene, I was astonished when I first saw it in Amadeus) the Comendatore is NOT THERE, just his voice. It lost all its impact when you see Don Giovanni talking to the audience. People usually wait two hours for this scene, and then it comes THIS? Sometimes originality is not better. I suggest to keep listening a CD version of the opera, and use your imagination for the rest."
5,A Real-Life Motivational Narrative,"Loree Hirschman tells her story with candor and lets the drama of her story speak for itself. She serves as a role model for women who are passionate about their work, especially in male-dominated environments, and her narrative is an encouragement. Ms. Hirschman paints a complete picture of her life as a Navy pilot- both the personal and the professional."
4,Hot Shots,"The Outside Shot is about a guy named Lonnie Jackson. In the story he plays basketball for Montclare. Many of the guys on the basketball team, including Lonnie, play some bums for money. The problem is that the guys from the basketball team could get kicked off the team for playing the bums at basketball. If that isn't enough the same group of guys from the basketball team bet on their own league games, and betting on your own games can sometimes even get you in jail.recomm I think that I would give this book eight out of ten stars. I rate this book with eight stars because it wasn't the best book but it did keep me wanting to read more. I end this book if you like sports books."
5,I grew up with this book!,"My mother, after 40 years of marriage, still has the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook she received as a newlywed. I grew up on a lot of recipes out of this book and I finally got one for myself. It has a lot of great basic and simple recipes as well as a classic favorites section."
3,"Wrong Edition, my fault","I ordered this as a gift, and when I got it it was the wrong edition, oops. Actually gifted it to someone else. Good condition."
3,Like the original better,"I have the original of this book (ok, I've had it over 35 yrs!) Bought this one for a neighbor who hasn't really learned to cook. Have to say I like the original much better; this is full of glossy pages and fewer recipes. Wouldn't have bought it had I looked inside it. Hopefully she'll get good use from it, however."
3,A valuable examination of an ignored topic,"Although written in a very dense, scholarly language, A People That Shall Dwell Alone provides a firm foundation for examining one aspect of Jewish ingroup and outgroup activities and behavior. More accessible, is MacDonald's second book in this series, Separation and Its iscontents: Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Anti-Semitism.If you can only afford one book, buy the second. Those interested in this subject, however, will want to buy both. MacDonald is also working to complete the third volume of this trilogy which, together with these two currently available volumes, should serve as the definitive works on this subject for years to come."
5,"A candid, compelling, compassionate, illuminating novel.","Seventy-year-old Texan Jimmy Heron, shattered by the tragic death of his wife, takes to the road as he tries to outrun his pain. When he is befriended by Cory Miller and Leigh O'Brien (a lesbian couple living in Reliance, Oregon) the possibilities for a renewed life, for trust and commitment, open up for him once again. But his two new friends are the target of a vicious harassment campaign fueled by the bigotry of the Christian Right. Spreading lies and fear couched as ""family values"", the fire and brimstone of the Mt Goshen Church of the Righteous spills over, igniting an all-too-rel conflagration. In its heat, a community is forged and a town remembers how it got its name. The Second Coming of Curly Red could be torn from today's newspaper headlines and is a candid, compelling, compassionate, and illuminating novel. Highly recommended."
2,"PROGSTERS, SKIP RIGHT TO JESTER","Machiavel was a 1970s and 80s band who had several identities. Followers of the progressive rock genre will want to skip this collection, which has many short, straight-ahead rock and pop songs. Their symphonic masterpiece ""Jester"" is the one you want. I bought both on amazon.com, and will likely jettison this Anthology CD. Jester is what I need."
4,Sometimes life does imitate art. . .,"A heartwarming and profound novel about an Eastern European who surprisingly becomes pope. No, it's not a fictional account of the election of John Paul II -- it was written many years before the current Pope's election.Surrounding the main plot are a number of sub-plots dealing with the very human problems of abortion, infidelity, divorce, homosexuality, and many of the other issues which continue to plauge the world and the Church.This book is highly recommended."
4,Thoughts of a Pope,"A prescient book about the future Popes, evidently published the day John XXIII died.Prescient in that John Paul 1 evidently wanted to give much of the Churches wealth to help the poor and John Paul II was from Eastern Europe (Poland).Interesting extracts from the Pope's 'diary' where he writes his personal thoughts about wanting to make his mark on the Vatican and the world.I was a bit disappointed in the end where it was rather left hanging without a final climactic action but overall an excellent read.The film of the book had a better finale but was only loosely based on the book (inspired by?).The Shoes of the Fisherman"
4,Morris West thumbs up,The Shoes of a Fisherman is very well written. You have to put yourself into the setting of the early 60's. The combination of action and contemplation keeps up the interest and makes you think. The events in light of what has actually happened shows deep research and insight into the times.
2,Abominable drivel for 2013,"When I read this as an 11 year old kid in 1964, I just LOVED it! But then my taste was all in my mouth. Now the lengthy internal monologues, stilted conversations and sexist language would make a modern reader toss it in the garbage. Sure, it's been overcome by events, having been published 50 years ago, but that's not the problem. The problem is the nearly unreadable style. It would now rise as high on any popularity chart as a Thomas Hardy novel. Maybe not quite that high. It's possible to write about the past and make it engaging, but West is too busy sermonizing and pontificating (Sorry!) to write an interesting story for people today to enjoy. It didn't age well. In retrospect I wonder what the hell I found so compelling back then."
3,An Interesting Old Book,I had heard of this book a long time ago and decided on a whim to order it. It was a book with a unique perspective regarding the role of the Pope and his restrictions. With the Soviet Union as its background it gives an interesting slant on how things work in both politics and religion behind the scenes. Although fiction I can imagine the events depicted actually taking place. It's an interesting read if this type of literature appeals to you.
3,Delivery disappointment,The book arrived in good condition but it took almost three weeks for it to arrive from Florida. The book club came and went and I still didn't have the book. I don't think I will be ordering used books from Amazon again.
2,Other Books,"The pope is dead. Always a cause of a bunch of shenanigans and nastiness. They go through all the rigmarole that surrounds finding a new bloke. Amazingly enough he turns out to be a russkie, and a halfway decent guy, to boot. All in all, sounds pretty unbelievable all around."
4,Excellent book on what to expect after a suicide,"I read this book 10 months after my husband committed suicide and I wish I had read it sooner. After my husband's death I read several books dealing with loss and death. Those books were very good at describing grief and what to expect, however, suicide was not covered. And in no way did those books prepare me for what I was going to go through. I found myself in this book over and over again. I found out that it is NORMAL to feel guilty, to withdraw, to punish yourself, to be blamed for the suicide, to blame others for the suicide, to love and miss my husband but also feel relief that he is no longer in my life, to feel that life will never be anything but a living hell.I have had significant insights about myself and other family members after reading this book that will help me continue to live on."
2,Grieving sister,"My sister killed herself two days ago and I am so lost and heartbroken. I went looking for a book to help me get through the pain. This book was not helpful. It seems like the author is trying to educate you on the subject of suicide rather than help you deal with it. I dont want to read a book full of other peoples stories. I am living my own nightmare I dont need to hear about other people's horrible experiences. It tells you the normal symptoms a suicide survivor experiences and tells you that they are normal, so what. I dont need to be told its normal to have nightmares, I need to know what to do about it. This book might be better for someone who lost someone several years ago and wants some things explained to them, but for someone experiencing a recent death this book does not offer any comfort, I am returning it."
1,"Heartbreaking, but realistic story of a competitive Pointer kennel.","I read this book about 10 years ago, thinking it was a child's book. I got it off a 50 cent library table. It is intelligently written, but a heartbreaking chronicle of the life of a purebred Pointer kennel, and the greatest product of that kennel. It describes pointer trials in detail, and is interesting. However, the cruel beginning and sad end make this a little too much reality for any child. This might be a good read for a hunter, but I'd never give it to a youngster."
5,Rolling Stones meet the Beatles,"This is the third album from Mando Diao, and is their best album. All their albums are great, but this one is excellent. If you ever wondered what the Beatles would sound like doing the harder songs of the Rolling Stones, then this is your band. There is not a bad song on the album (or on the second disc that came with the import version.) The highlights of the album are Long Before Rock n' Roll, The Wildfire, The New Boy, TV & Me, and Ochrasy."
1,Lousy sound quality.,"Some nice touches feature-wise including dual headband, which seems comfortable, and auto retractable cord.Now for the negatives:* Cord is very short, as long as is typical for on-the-go portables, not suitable for a full-sized set.* Sound quality sucks! Sounds muddled, no mids, no highs, just mush. And heavy distortion from one of the drivers.Pass this one by."
2,Don't waste your money,"I have been purchasing each of the pieces for Dinosaurland toddler set, I have been disappointed with everything that comes in, this is just the latest. The drapes are thin and almost like a cheap bedsheet. As the other reviewer stated, valance doesn't come with it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!"
5,"Great, Safe Family Entertainment!","This is one of those rare cartoons that neither demeans parents nor encourages crude behavior.This series, in fact, encourages children to obey parents and authorities, respect the rules, and always be nice to others. You'll find this DVD and the other-larger DVD set-to be well worth the price of purchase."
2,"good sound, but mine was broken.","Mine was broken when I got it --- after playing a CD for about 15 minutes the sound would start getting really noisy and full of static. For the first 15 minutes, however, the sound was nice. If you get one that works it is nice. Also, note that for MP3 playback, there is no ID3 tag support --- basically it is really primitive and only shows a number (for which track is playing)."
2,ok for limited use,"i bought this to play old radio shows in mp3 that don't play on alot of better machines (the encoding is low i think). they play fine but it's very annoying to fast forward one show at a time and sometimes the buttons aren't responsive at all. it stays in one spot so it isnt getting alot of movement which might increase it's life. all in all , it does the job and the sound is fine on my machine for my purpose but it certainly isn't worth any more than i paid for it. When i have the time, i'll probably test other machines to see if they will do the job better. It does give better sound than my Rio portable mp3 disk player which i play thru a headset or speakers. the Rio has very low volume (which is probably why they lost the market to IPOD and are now not making them)."
1,Piece of crap,"This is an unreliable piece of junk. I never could get it to play a CD-RW disc, it would not play mp3s very well (sometimes only recognizing the first 3 or 4 tracks), and the cd player quit altogether after a couple months. The sound was pretty good though, I guess."
2,Not pleased with it,"It works well except for two large problems. I can clearly hear the spin-up and spin down of the disc during mp3 playback, and there is a relatively loud ""pop"" sound as one mp3 finishes and another starts. It's very jarring, esp. as I wish to use this at work and don't like to be distracted from my music. I tried using a better quality CD-R and burned it at a relatively low speed to avoid any other problems, but nothing helped. This one is going back to Amazon, and I'm getting something else."
2,Did not work well for my old radio shows,"It did not work well for me. I had originally owned the RCA Rcd148, which had features the 160 does not have. The 160 has no search feature. It only has fast-forwarding. I could not choose the program I wanted to hear, as I purchased it for old-time radio shows. I could choose shows on the RCD 148."
1,Died Without Warning in Less than a Year; Bummer,"We bought this RCA RCD160 Portable MP3/CD player boom box with AM/FM tuner for strictly limited use, just to play a couple of hours per week, as we practiced our dancing. We certainly never took this item to the nearby beach, there was no sand in this baby. We used it, in fact, only in AC mode, never with batteries; only the CD player, and that only sparingly, and extremely gently. We could hear the songs we played well enough, and found the sound quality acceptable for our limited needs. However, the product suddenly, without warning died on us, and that in less than a year. What a bummer!"
2,Good sound while it lasts.,"I bought this CD player specifically for it's mp3 playing abilities. And for about 30 hours of disc playing, it worked very nicely. But, then the CD part of the box died and it ain't coming back. Now I have a very nice looking doorstop.Before that happened this boombox sounded very nice with good bass and a hefty volume. One peculiar problem I had was that while playing MP3 discs, I would occasionally hear a loud electronic beep coming from the speakers during the music.This model has been around awhile and is on it's way out, I'd suggest just skipping it."
2,"need to reset daily, good bass though","I bought this back in October. I have not been able to get the radio stations to even funtion and tune in. The cd player does work on this one. Mine does have good bass,(on the custom setting) but the settings for bass and equalizer need to be reset each new daily use. Mine does get alittle warm, after about 40 minutes.The audio cds and mp3 cds played fine, no skips.For my boombox to shut completely off, I do have unplug it from the wall...LOLBest option: Buy a portable walkman style mp3/cd player, and a set of fully powered speakers. You would probably pay about the same for good working mp3 player."
4,THE MESSY SITUATION AFTER THE CIVIL WAR MAKES AN INTERESTING BOOK,"THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN USING MUCH OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE 1860'S AND SOMETIMES THIS MIGHT THROW YOU FOR A LOSS..THIS BOOK FOLLOWS A FAMILY THROUGH THE MESSED UP WORLD AND ENDLESS DISASTER THAT THE CIVIL WAR CREATED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH--THE BOOK IS NOT A BATTLEFIELD THAT HOLLYWOOD WOULD PAINT, BUT RATHER YOU FIND YOURSELF WADING IN THE SLIME OF ROTTING BODIES,AND THE BLACK HUMOR OF PEOPLE HOPING TO SURVIVE AS BEST THEY ARE ABLE.."
5,Eminem? WTF!!??,"Hey yo, I saw these guys Giddy Motors open for Eminem in Detroit last summer. They came onstage and blew the white baseball caps and fake jewelry off all the bros and mooks in attendance. This dude I went to the show with, I think his name was Kel, dropped his near-beer and ran for the exit, crying like a little girl. He couldn't handle anything this explosive and damaged and devastating. Last I heard, Kel was washing snot and tears out of his All American Rejects t-shirt while listening to ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and thinking about how, like, poignant the lyrics are man!I recommend this record to anyone who doesn't listen to All American Rejects."
2,Shop Around,I purchased this watch for my Mom as a gift and the band is heavy and for the price you can find a better watch out there.
4,This is some funny ish!,"Commodore 64, throw in a fresh new sound to the ever evovling world of hip hop, their crazy songs are definitely worth the listen. songs like ""Straight out of CompUSA"" make parody of all the played out gangster rappers of today, and shows their immense creative talent along with their definitely brilliant lighter side."
5,"Top book, should be a six star option.","This book consists of a collection of essays by H.A.R Gibb that have been collected by Stanford J Shaw (he who wrote probably the best books on Ottoman and modern Turkish history you can find) The chapters concern issues such as the early history of Islam, Saladin, the armies of Saladin, the development of Sufism and Islamic law and Arabic literature.This has got to be one of the best studies of Islamic history you can find (it was put together specifically for the American reader by the way) He rightly points out the multi national forces of Saladin (who were made up mostly of Turkomans and Kurds unlike the popular belief that they were 'Arabs') His essay on Sufism is excellent as his essay on the development of Arab literature.This has got to be a 'must buy' for any student of Islamic studies at University. Then again, if you are buying anything written by Gibb you know you cant go wrong."
4,battery,the batteries were just what I was looking for; but the cost of shipping such a small item was too costly.
4,Batteries needed yesterday...,I recently lost power in my Streamlight stylus flash pen. So I went on line to Amazon and found this great offer. I received my replacement batteries within two days...nuff said!
5,Trust Energizer,"The product arrived a day earlier than estimated...good job! I have not had to use the batteries yet as the unit I ordered came with a battery of the same type, but I trust Energizer and the price was great for my pocket!"
4,Streamlight Batteries,Batteries purchased by Police Officer for Stylus light; difficult to find locally. Light is effective in daylight when dealing with subjects suspected of DUI.
1,9 Volt Battery = 6 AAAA Batteries,"A low cost alternative is to remove the casing from an alkaline 9 volt battery, which has 6 AAAA batteries inside!"
1,My order contained expired batteries,"My device uses three at a time. The first three lasted for only a couple of minutes. I swapped out the batteries for the remaining three. Same thing. I then checked the expiration date stamped on the batteries. it was ""0911"" these batteries expired nine months ago."
3,$$$$ not AAAA,"Overpriced batteries. Unfortunately, these batteries cannot be easily found. Therefore, you must pay the price. I suggest staying away from products that require AAAA batteries."
2,O.K. performance but poor fitment for being labeled product specific.,Only one gripe but it seems to be making itself more and more apparent to me. The batteries rattle around inside the body of the Stylus and the feel completely changes. I had been using Radio Shack batteries prior and never even thought about fitment because it was never a problem. Won't be purchasing these again. I plan on keeping the remaining three as a backup set.
5,aquafun,"really like these original sryle aquarunners and would be happy if they were also available in wide.The follow-up model is next to impossible to wear on feet, the fixtures press hard on bones. So please- Aquajogger- make this model available againthanks, jm"
5,Gorgeous and Great,"I bought this watch a few weeks ago, and so far I love it. The only difficulty I've had with it is a stiff clasp. Once or twice I've needed help to get it off my arm, but it is getting easier to unclasp every day.This watch is simple and stylish, but elegant and it goes with everything."
5,masterpiece,"even though the songs on it are now a bit old, it is still a great buy for those who just want a compilation cd of rap and dont really know the songs.. i highly recommend"
1,self-serving arrogant blowhard hypocrite,"Nancy Grace is a hilarious pathetic circus act. She's the most offensive example of the very 24/7 media spin machine that she pretends to criticize. If you enjoy being preached to by a know-it-all media whore, this is the book for you."
1,"IF you know the person who wrote the book, you will not buy it.",This person who wrote this book is like a snake with a venom. She judges pple by their outward appearance and also without knowing fact would like to Judge pple.. So I dont think what ever she write is readable.. only ignorant pple will read the book and appreciate it.Better avoid if you dont want to think like a loser!!..
1,Nancy is both ignorant and opinionated--an appalling combo,"Nancy is so blinded by her agenda--attacking defense attorneys and defendants--that she manipulates or ignores facts that are contrary to her extreme views. I have rarely heard anything worthwhile come out of her mouth on CourtTV, and this book is no different. I hope readers (and CourtTV viewers) who are less informed about the judicial system (I am a lawyer) realize not to take anything she says at face value."
2,Not Much There!,"Nancy Grace's theme in this book is to bewail the tricks and successes of defense lawyers. She cites some cases where this directly led to tragic crimes committed by a defendant getting off for a prior crime.While I sympathize with her point of view, I don't know what can be done about it. On the other side is the problem of people being unjustly sentenced for crimes they did not commit - fortunately new DNA evidence has exonerated a number of them. However, the reality is that tightening the system to release fewer guilty people will more than likely also lead to more innocent people being sentenced to life in prison, or even death. (See Bill Kurtis' ""Death Penalty on Trial."
1,She's Nuts!,"It is impossible to read this pitifully bad book without also conjuring up the image of Nancy Grace on CNN. She appears nightly with her face invariably twisted and contorted in rage and disgust, while bullying the weak and hapless and hopeless. It is beyond bizarre that CNN allows this embarrassing, demented freak to continue to appear on its programming. Nancy Grace may be the meanest and most cynical person appearing on television. And she's crazy."
4,Nancy Grace rocks,"Being a big fan of Ms. Grace, I was not dissappointed with the book. The end was a little dull, but most of it was interesting."
3,cuckoo! cuckoo!,"It's a hoot to watch Nancy Grace on television, trying to keep her demons under check. Reading her is less amusing, as her mania does not come through with the same smoldering weirdness.I don't necessarily agree with her opinion that Nambla should open branches in elementary schools, nor with her unprovoked attack on Rosa Parks (who she calls a ""sedentary, no-account, trash-for-brains criminal""). But her admission that she likes to watch animals eat their young is certainly courageous and gives us greater insight into what the Bonzo Dog Band might have called the ""caverns of her mind."""
1,Hypocrisy of the Highest Order,"Nancy Grace disgraces my friend's mother's television set every so often. Seems to me she's part of the title's ""24/7 Media"" problem, but here she is banking on readers' hard-earned bucks by trying to appeal (pun intended)."
1,Passionate... but WRONG-HEADED!,"Nancy Grace would indict a HAM SANDWICH. EVERYONE is guilty when DISgrace is the host!Nancy's shrill screams about Gary Condit and Chandra Levy still ring in my ears. THAT wasn't her first (or her last!) mistake either, and there is NEVER a mea culpa!Pity the fools who follow her blindly. When she's right, she's terrific. But when NOT.... YIKES!"
3,Good but empty,"If you've watched Nancy Grace over the years, you've heard ALL this diatribe before. Lightly amusing, alas, murder and mayhem are not. Grace points that out in these writings. This book does draw the reader into her mind. Well written and worth a trip to the local library. As one closes this book, you're left wondering ""what just happened?"" Grace, although an effective attorney, you'll find is MUCH more leading in a vocal way rather than in a literay way. My advise, read and return yet continue viewing on CNN Headline News and Court TV. A talented attorney doth not make a great read."
3,OVERRULED!,"Slightly repetitive, she's better on tv than in the written word. Still, as an RN and former police dispatcher, I found the overview of our present legal system to be eye-opening. There's plenty of outspoken men; it's essential to have Nancy's voice - speaking for all victims of violent crime - heard in any shape or form. I have less respect for defense attorneys and alot more for prosecutors after reading this inside story."
1,Please remove this woman from public space!,"Nancy Grace is a joke. I would have thought that, by now, most of her ""entourage"" would have figured out what a self-agrandizing bag of air this woman really is. Standing up for Victims? Really? What about the 'victim' who is the falsely accused - hands up everyone who has heard Nancy sympathize with a falsely accused person.Your 'tell it like it is' idol only tells it like she'd like it to be in order to bring her the highest ratings. She doesn't even have the 'grace' and decency to apologize to the individuals whose names she has attempted to drag through the dirt.Come on America - open your mind and think about what Nancy Grace actually stands for. CNN - get this person off the airwaves - before you lose any remaining credibility as a 'news' channel.I have no 'love' or 'hate' feelings for Nancy Grace. I just find her repugnant and pathetic and I truly can't understand why anyone with the slightest of intelligent thought would think her 'great'??"
5,An attorney who tells it as it is,"Nancy is as honest and straight forward as any attorney can be. A must read for anyone interested how twisted our judicial system is. If anyone can possiblly ""fix"" it Nancy would be the one would be the one. A must read!Mildred L. GehringFt. Pierce, FL'fix"" it"
5,You are all wrong!,"I think this book is great. If you don't like Nancy Grace then why are you on here reviewing her book? If you haven't read the book why even leave a review? Ignorance doesn't make sense to me I guess. But if you are a fan of Nancy Grace then you will definitely enjoy this book. Even some people who aren't fans will enjoy this book. Nancy may be very opinionated and apparently that hurts some peoples feelings, but take this book for what it is. Its not here to change the world. Plus all of the proceeds go to charity."
3,Turning Justice Into A Circus - Loud & Brash - A Sad Day,"Nancy Grace and other TV Stars like her and their exploitive TV shows are a very deep American tragedy as they are turning our society's quest for justice into a terrible circus. This book is no better than the hundreds of TV shows she has been on convicting persons of crimes without a trial again and again. There is at least one famous case in Utah where Nancy Grace convicted a man on TV who was eventually proved to be 100% innocent, but who died in jail where he was placed for no reason, in part, because of the ranting and raving of Nancy Grace and other TV stars who jumped to the wrong conclusion without knowing the facts. As I write this the jury is in deliberation on the Jackson case, and Nancy is mocking Michael Jackson for going to the hospital and she is ""telling the world"" that she thinks he is guilty. Keep in mind that the jury is not even sequestered. Where is the justice? Not to be found here."
1,drivel,Pathetic nonsense. A waste of time. The same shrill tone and draconian remedies offered on her show. A real loser.
4,Gender difference of opinion on this 1945 spy mystery,"My husband and I agreed on much of this book. It's a solid enough mystery. The historical and geographic settings make for very interesting reading. We both started out knowing virtually nothing about the atomic bomb project. We now know much more of the history and personalities of the projects -- even if we are still clueless on the science.Where we diverged strongly in opinion concerned the romance between Mike and Emma. My husband says that ""it's the stuff of guy fantasies."" As the daughter of WW2 era parents, my reaction was that the romance was just that -- such a fantasy that it interfered with my ability to enjoy the story. I just can't buy Emma's promiscuity in the context of what I know of women during those years.So, three stars from me and five stars from my husband = four stars."
5,You'll Also Want To Know About...,"Amazon's ""similar subject"" links are useful; they will lead you, for example, to the fine novel titled ""Principles of American Nuclear Chemistry"". And you should also check the IMDB, under Plot Keyword ""nuclear-weapons"", for films (good and bad) about passions in that time and place, such as ""Desert Bloom"", ""Eternity"", ""Fat Man and Little Boy"", ""Mulholland Falls"", and of course, ""Oppenheimer"".But the closest novel of all, in terms of the the narrator's role and voice, the literary quality, and the moral issues is ""Who?"" by Algis Budrys. Ignore the sci-fi cover art (and the Canadian movie); just remember what Kanon has Oppie say several times: ""What a man's faith is, he is."""
2,"Stallion Gate, Anyone?","Though Los Alamos was competently written as the old saw goes; what was good wasn't original and what was original wasn't good. Most of the intrigue and paranoia of life on and around the Hill was originally done by Martin Cruz Smith in Stallion Gate, and the parallels between these novels were just too close for comfort. All Los Alamos made want to do was re-read Stallion Gate which I did, confirming that it is the far superior novel. If you like Los Alamos definitely pick up Stallion Gate and also Rhodes Making of the Atomic Bomb."
4,Great read,"The historical aspects of Los Alamos are very educational although somewhat fictional. The characters are believable, especially the love interest for the main character and the small town sheriff. I have read this book twice and enjoyed it both times. The ending is a little to much of a fade out for my liking, but might symbolize the tensions that lay before us in the cold war. Would make a good movie with the write screenplay and believable actors."
2,"shallow, a fantasy for men only","Los Alamos is a book by a man, about a man, for men. As a female reader, neither the story nor the characters had much to engage me. I did enjoy the setting, and wished he could have devoted more space to describing how the bomb was built and tested. The love story left me cold. I felt uncomfortable with his treatment of Robert Oppenheimer, not knowing if it was accurate. By the end of the book, I was caught up in the whodunnit, but still felt unsatisfied with the characters, especially the female ones."
3,Some suspense at Los Alamos in the 40's,"The story was interesting in that it gave an insite into life at Los Alamos during the Manhatten Project in the 1940's. Woven around a murder in Santa Fe, the book references the atomic bomb effort, some of the famed scientists, and the hero, a New Yorker, who is brought to Los Alamos to solve the crime. Little does he know how his life will be forever changed. The author provides a good glimpse of Los Alamos and the Santa Fe area. Makes you feel you are there!"
2,Readable but horrible,"Characters are wooden dolls, intrigue is primitive, principals act stupid just to keep the action going, and the whole thing is melodramatic to say the least. Second star is for being well written."
2,On the FaZIZZle,"(Spoiler) So when the protaganist gets hit by the murderer, he curls into a ball and gets saved by his girlfriend? And it's not a comedy? This book had a promising beginning, but the Irish Connelly turns into a schlemiel."
4,As good or better than Stallion Gate,"Stallion GateI suppose if security at Los Alamos had been better, the idealistic friendswouldn't have been able to ship the plans out.All these words on sex, cheating and spies and never a mention of Klaus Fuchs.I had read all this before with pretty much the same characters and scenes in Stallion Gate.We actually need the equivalent of a Manhattan project for fusion in these days of global warming,but they already have the Teller-Ulam-Sakarhov H-Bomb! The government seems to only get up for weapons?The question will always remain: was Oppie a spy or not?Even after Fuchs was uncovered, a probable spy remainedwho leaked the H-bomb plans.Candidates are:William TellerStanislaw UlamJohn von NeumannJ.Robert OppenheimerMy guess is that it was a team effort.They were a brotherhood of idealists."
2,Jumping Off the Shelves?,"I purchased this book in an airport because the clerk said it had been ""jumping off the shelves."" After reading this book I can assure you that the books were ""jumping off the shelves"" in an effort to avoid a more painful death. I was disappointed. Don't pick this up unless you are looking for something to put you to sleep."
2,"Overrated, too long","This book was so hyped that I really wanted to read it and like it. However, after struggling through the first 100 pages, I still had no interest in the murder of Bruner. Instead of building the murder case/investigation up, Kanon opts unsuccessfully to develop the romance between Connolley and Emma. Their stilted conversations became tiresome, and Kanon's feeble attempt to portray the two as flirtatious fell quite flat. As a thriller, the book is okay. As a romance, it is unsuccessful. If you must try this book, go for the paperback version"
2,Predictable. Almost Silly!,"Totally predictable. Thin plot. A giant waste of time and money. If you want a thriller avoid this book, if you want a love story surely there must be better ones out there"
2,I wish I hadn&#65533;t finished this book.,The reader is treated to an investigator who's approach to investigating is to hang around and sleep with a married woman as much as possible. His big break is as a result of a chance encounter. And we learn the details of the plot from ploters who become astonishingly loquacious when confronted.
1,Horrible Horrible Writing,"This was the worst book I have read in a long long time. The writing was full off cliches that were like one liners in a bar. The unnessessary love scene was not even written well. It was like a teenager describing sex for the first time. The only reason I finished was to see who did what. Even after you find out, the book continues to drag on after. To much time was spent trying to set up the back ground and the chemistry between Connelly and Emma. From the get go this was a horrible trash pulp novel. And Like a cherry on the top I even found a typo. Go figure from a printing executive."
2,"Not as good as ""Savage Day""","If you think that this book has an intriguing or interesting plot idea I would suggest you go to your library or local used bookstore and try to find a copy of Thomas Wiseman's much superior and well written novel ""Savage Day"". It's basically the same premise but Wiseman pulls it off with great literary flair."
4,Better than nost,"I only figured out ""who dun it"" very near then end of the book. Almost all the details fit together, making this a very satisfying mystery. It may have helped that I was born and raised in Los Alamos and most of the details were right."
4,"Though flawed, an engrossing and entertaining first novel","Picked this up to relieve the boredom of commuting by Metro North and it did the job - and then some. Though there was a curious lack of depth to some of the characters and seemed to take too long to get to where it was going, I found it hard to put this book down. A more convincing portrayal of the Los Alamos portrayal than it's Martin Cruz Smith 'cousin' ""Stallion Gate""."
1,"""Los Alamos"" drops a bomb on readers","Joseph Kanon takes a great detective setting, Los Alamos during the last hectic days of the creation of the atomic bomb, but proceeds to lull the reader to sleep with his dull and plodding writing. The only reason I give this one star is that it provided the necessary airplane relief from a yacky neighbor."
1,A dud.,"What a disappointment! This novel does nothing to set the atmosphere, reading more like a modified screenplay (which I'm suspecting was one of the motivations playing in Kanon's mind). The characters are poorly (re)imagined, the settings dismissively portrayed, and the writing style unremarkable. Also, I had the feeling that the author didn't work on immersing himself in the circumstances of New Mexico, WWII, or the Project. It's all too contemporary in parts (seems like it's pulled out of the 1980s instead of the 1940s). Finally, the plot is too simplistic and rather dull. A dud."
2,Like Soup Diluted with Water,"The subject is very ambitious and intriguing; Los Alamos in WW2. But unfortunately, this book is extremely poor as a novel. It is lengthy and tedious, and I felt like drinking soup diluted several times with water. It contains several interesting matters such as a guilty conscience of the scientists for creating the dreadful weapon, but they are described only superficially and not appealing at all.And the characters are all dull and flat, especially Connolly, the protagonist. It might be a little better if he were a mechanical narrator who just reported the life in Los Alamos to readers. But he artificially displays his ""personality"" with an abrupt adultery. That makes the story increasingly diffuse and boring.I won't accuse this book as a complete waste of time, because it let me have a glimpse of the inside of Los Alamos in WW2. But I feel terribly frustrated why such an intriguing subject could not become a better novel."
4,Interesting read,"I liked this book, partly because I lived in Los Alamos as a child and partly because I am interested in the historical aspects of the Manhattan Project. As a thriller it was pretty good independent of those aspects, because the plot was complex enough that you couldn't see where the author was going with it from a million miles away. Of course the guy gets the girl in the end, but it seemed fresh and interesting to me."
2,Too bad,"Curiously dissapointing. Might have been the hype, the setting, (and the cool cover art), but pretty forgettable all the way around."
2,"Good Plot, But didn't connect",Kanon has an excellent idea and plot line for a good book but it just doesn't have the pizzaz I was looking for. At times it was slow but I finished it. I hope Kanon can write something better cause I'll give him one more chance.
3,While it kept my interest it did not captivate me.,The book is fairly well written and the subject interesting the mystery is weak. The strength of the book is the examination of the scientists view of the process and implications of making the gadget. I was disappointed in the end -- I thought so much more could have been built into the story.
3,"One eye on the plot, one eye on the movie version","During World War II, Michael Connolly is sent to Los Alamos to investigate the murder of a low-level employee. Is it connected to the top secret work of the Manhattan Project, or just a random crime? The book expertly re-creates the unique atmosphere of a mini-city stuffed full of geniuses desperately trying to discover the mysteries of nuclear fission in time to win the war. Unfortunately, the plot becomes bogged down in formulaic thriller devices, including Connolly's affair with a beautiful married woman and an improbable cast of international spies. Like so many other recent works, this novel seems written with one eye on the plot and one eye on who will be cast in the movie version."
3,"close, but no cigar","I really wanted to love this book. At times I DID love this book. But like so many books today it's 100 pages too long. Which precludes it from delivering the promised thrills. I did like the characters and the setting a lot. Some of the writing is very evocative. But in terms of the mystery, when fictional characters intermingle with real-life people, it is not hard to figure out who done what. I am a fairly fast reader and this book took forever to finish"
2,300 pages too long,"well, i finished the thing. took DAYS because it just was not captivating. but i couldn't believe that all of the hype on the cover was wrong - there had to be some wonderful nuanced ending. but no, the book had too much repetition of the ""secrecy"" thing, not enough plot, gratuitous sex, and...as i've said before, 300 extra pages. wait. make that 350 extra pages. save your money."
3,Historical Fiction done well.,"This was my first Kanon book, and while I found the history surrounding the A-Bomb development interesting and believable, the mystery was strained at times."
3,Somber novel about somber spectacular time....,"Somber, thoughtful novel seasoned with science (a soupcon) and sex (a pinch). Plot unfolds through characters that could be more interesting. Oppenheimer in particular is a genuine missed opportunity -- shoulda worked harder on him (many people have). A murder mystery."
4,Facinating Historical Perspective-A Decent Novel,"What makes this book is its historical setting. With a facinating perspective, the reader is able to watch the characters as they take part in the US government's most contraversial project. The novel reads well, with likeable, mostly believable characters and several interesting plot twists. But read this one for its look into wartime America."
3,Success around the edges,"This book succeeded with me some as a mystery, very little as a romance but much as a fiction of its setting. I enjoyed the stories of the bomb and the characters involved in the project; I often paused to compare the novel's anecdotes against memories of nonfiction works on the making of the bomb and the people involved. Having spent a good part of my childhood touring the sights of northern New Mexico, the setting was warmly nostalgic, adding to the pleasure. It's not a classic but it's a decent way to pass some time."
5,earthy and very soothing melodies and uplifting nushies,"The album is truely very peaceful and serene.the producers have great insight into what peaceful vibes are about and depth is definately proven in the beats, to say the least.I would of hoped the cd lasted longer than expected, but the duration was just enough to entice your ears to tickle you body for more.pleasurely recommended for the quility of listeners, within the rubbish bin around which we are surrounded by much of decay with music these days, this album will urge you to move on ambitously to hold hope for more pure and good nuggats of music in the future.pleasure oakes, pleasure truely to listen to your music.Cheersmitchy"
4,Freak in!,"I remember watching Freakazoid as a teenager, looking forward to every episode. The reason being, it truly has the touch of the original Looney Tunes. The music, the gags, everything feels just as silly as when I was a child, able to understand how Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies alike reached out to the mature audiences as well. Worthy of remaining in my collection. My only beef with the art directors is it was unfortunate they could not always utilize the best talents and inkers in all the episodes--the same crews that drew and inked not only the title intro for Freakazoid; but many of the episodes that followed. I understand it's budget-related; but cheapens the experience as well."
5,HUGGBIES!,"If you know what that title is all about, I don't need to convince you to buy this set. Heck, you probably have your own review on here about it. This is right up there with Animaniacs in the best things Stephen Spielberg and Warner Bros. have ever produced. If you haven't seen it, you need to see this, because if you missed this, you missed what it meant to be alive in the 90s. This is cartoons at its best."
3,Ripoff off The Mask is far better than original,"Hmm, does no one think, like me, the main reason Freakazoid exists was the unexpected box office of Jim Carrey's The Mask?Regardless, Freakazoid is a hoot, and way funnier than Jim Carrey. The parodies-within-parody - notably Toby Danger - are excellent. Sure it's mostly lowbrow, but throwaway lines from Ed Asner and other superb voice talent is worth listening closely for.Long overdue."
4,Freakin' Fantastic,"Although I originally bought this DVD for my husband, my six-year old daughter loves it! We really enjoy watching it together. There is a lot of humor that adults can appreciate. But, my daughter finds it hilarious. It is a great DVD."
4,Nice cult classic cartoon,"This is one of those really weird and under the radar cartoons that came out on the WB with Animaniacs, Tiny Toons, and Batman: The Animated Series. You should get this show because its so different and off the wall but its very fun. Sucks though they only had 2 seasons of this. It's also a very cheap show to purchase and I recommend getting it to add to your collection because it is truly a one of a kind show."
4,And now remember to watch,"This show made me watch the credits. It made me video tape it to watch the credits. For embedding in the credits are often ""fake"" screens filled with in jokes, or references to the times ""Emmet Nerveend"" shows up. It was always funny.Maybe the DVD show's sales will be compelling enough to allow for the show's character to be resurrected (like FUTURAMA) in a movie or new series."
5,Excellent Vietnam book,"One of the first books I read about the Vietnam War. Accurate and well worth while. Bruce HoffmanAnd My Mother Danced with Chesty Puller: Adventures of a Marine in the rear, to combat in Vietnam"
5,I agree..This is the finest of the Vietnam novels,"I just finished reading this book. I nearly cried near the end of the book when two of the characters were killed. I felt like I lost two good buddies. That's how vivid the story is. I feel like I need to make a pilgrimage to the An Hoa Basin, Go-Hoi Island, and the Arizona Valley. For closure.I never served in the Marines. Never saw combat in Vietnam or elsewhere. But I feel like I experienced it while reading this book.Read this book. It will make you feel something. Each person who reads this book will have a different reaction. But I can be certain you will have a reaction to it. What a heck of a story! A love story. An anti-war story. A story of men in battle. You can't read this book and not come away at least a bit changed."
5,A non-stop action book about grunts in Vietnam!,"This book was absolutely amazing. I was always interested in the Vietnam War but I only found out about FOF after Richard Pittman (a Congressional Medal of Honor winner) recommended it -- in ""And Brave Men, Too."" I could NOT put it down! And the fact that James Webb WAS in Vietnam makes it seem as if it were true instead of fiction! It's a must for anyone's collection of books!"
5,One of the best books about the Viet Nam War,One of the best books about the Viet Nam War. The book unites unnique prespectives on the conflict from all different view points. Excellent reading.
5,One of the Very Best Vietnam Books,"This is an amazing work when you consider it's Webb's first book. The writing is so compelling you may feel like you've been dropped into a rice paddy with Webb's/Hodges' platoon.In Robert Timberg's book, The Nightingale's Song, Webb is a featured character. He describes Webb's experiences from the Naval Academy through his stint as Secretary of the Navy. The real people who were main characters in Fields of Fire are discussed. He also tells the amazing story of how Webb read Hemingway at the urging of a law school classmate and decided he could write like that. I'm sure glad he did. All of his books are among the best I've read."
5,Dire Fields indeed!,"Having been through the thick of it, and survived I reluctantly read ""yet another Nam book"" this one hit me. What a great piece of writing! I lent it to a friend, who was also in country and he never gave it back. So I picked up another copy for the shelf. I still read it from time to time. Whew! Took me back. I could feel the sweat dripping and the searing heat and cool flights at altitude back to base. I even tasted the red grit again. Alright I'll quit trying to pump it up... just read it. Highly recommended if you weren't there... it will take you there."
5,Grandpa's review,"James Webb is a straight shooter. It verbalizes the action, nonsense, self-serving behaviour of some officers and the bravery of others and the people who have to carry the orders out. I was in during the latter end of Korea so I did not see combat. This book goes hand in hand with Oliver Stone's movie ""Platoon"".The book is visceral and true to all that I have learned about the Vietnam conflict. What a horible waste of life of young and old alike.It seems that a country fighting for its life can not be subjugated forever whether we like its politics or not.I have great respect for Jim Webb as an author and as a new Virginia Senator. I enjoyed his book very much."
3,Interesting book,"I knew very little about Vietnam prior to reading this book. I still dont know too much, but it was a very interesting read. It had a lot of very graphic details, I think some could have been omitted and still made the point. Honestly I wouldnt recommend it to folks I know based upon that. But once again it was a decent read."
1,Way better books out there..,"I stopped reading in the first 100 pages when the author went on and on about how Robert E Hodges lost 3 ancestors on Picketts Charge with the 9th Kentucky Infantry. There was not a single Confederate Kentucky unit any where near Gettysburg.If you want to read a good book on Vietnam, read: Rumor of War, Loon or Matterhorn."
3,Fields Of Fire,"This is a far different view of what I heard happened there,but leaving out boys hanging out there in the buch,I can see some of this going on. We did not do right by these G.I.'s"
3,Not as I expected!,"I have not finished reading this book, but so far, it is not what I thought it would be. As I am a Veteran of Vietnam. Maybe it will get better!"
5,From A Former Marine Officer,"James Webb, now a US Senator, formerly Secretary of the Navy, and once upon a time, a Marine Lieutenant, has captured the essence of brotherhood, duty, hardship, and sacrifice that all former Marines can relate to so strongly. This book brought back so many of the long-buried ghosts of my own service 30 years ago, and then resurrected my pride in serving. Anyone with an interest in the Vietnam conflict from an infantryman's standpoint will find this book indispensable."
2,so many problems,I agree with a lot of these reviews about this film being propaganda. There is a lot of missing evidence throughout this film. I hope people do more research about the issues brought out in this film before they fully form opinions on prescription medications.
1,SSRI Madness,"I'm no big pharma fan but what a joke. This film is like a mid-century propaganda film. It does nothing but make false claims. It claims antidepressants actually cause neurotransmitter deficiencies. That there is zero evidence that they help depression and that depression is basically made up by the drug companies. It shows footage from the Columbine shooting several times when only one of the shooters had been previously prescribed antidepressants. Obviously antidepressants weren't the common link in that situation. I could go on and on. If you watch this, research the claims online and you will get a different picture."
2,"Not a documentary, more of a propaganda film","Statistics are misused continuously in this film, coincidences are treated as prima facie evidence, and the film makes no pretext of actually investigating psychiatric pharmaceuticals. Now, I'm not saying that 4 year olds be routinely placed on psychiatric drugs, but this film is pure propaganda."
3,Earlier Edition of Apparitions,"I purchase both this book and Treece's ""Apparitions of Modern Saints"".... Apparitions is merely an updated, revised edition of this book."
4,great reference book,This is a great reference book even for resident physicians. I highly recommend having it in your library of medical books.
5,excellent reference,"I did not have to have this book for any of my classes; however, I purchased it to serve as a reference. It has excellent descriptive pictures. I like the writing style as well- it is not too verbose and complicated."
5,Excellent!!!!,The book was in excellent condition and the packing was very secure.I am very happy with my purchase and I will be shopping with Amazon again.P.S.The book was very cheap for the excellent condition it was in.
2,not so new,The pages were no longer bound - falling out of the binding. Fine other than that. Good for the very cheap price I guess.
3,Anatomy book- used,"I'm happy with the purchase of the 4th edition, however it was rated in good condition if I remember correctly and the spine is breaking down each day. I've only had it for 3 1/2 weeks and it will definitely be toast by the end of the semester. It's sure as heck beats the $180 cost of the new edition at school though. I would do it again"
3,Why so large?,"I am a University of Minnesoota student and we use this text for our introductory Human Anatomy course. (Unfortunately they came out with a new edition and I couldn't sell it back to the bookstore.) Strictly in terms of the content this book was average because I often needed more information on certain aspects of the human anatomy. My real frustration was due to the fact that I feel the publisher should have supplied a carrying case specifically designed to carry such a large, awkward book. I realize that the size contributed to larger pictures but I feel it was a bit overboard! Finally, as I mentioned before, a new edition came out very recently. The new book resembles the previous edition too much. It's unfortunate we live in such a capitalistic society as to allow such a situation to take place.."
4,good value,Works as advertised. All required hardware included. Upgraded from 3 prong to 4 prong no problem. Great price. Will be back for another if I need one.
2,What a preposterous storyline!,"I agree with another reviewer here about how the storyline andcharacters for this novel are just utterly preposterous! If theprotagonist of the novel really was an ultra-Orthodox Jew, nothingthat was expected of her after marriage would have been a surprise.The husband is originally portrayed as a sympathetic character but almost immediately becomes a caricature. He starts beating his wife and torturing her. Her parents don't give a hoot when she calls them to tell them that her husband is abusing her. Supposedly their lives revolved around her before she married. All of a sudden, they stopped caring. Real people just aren't like that.While the writing style was engaging, I finished this book merely for the entertainment value. The plot twists were so outrageous that they were quite amusing."
5,Could not put this book down,"Once I started this book...there was no putting it down.Heartwrenching then Heartwarming! The author portraysa side to people regardless of religious affiliation, whichalthough sad, there is always a way to overcome the evil inthis world... This is an example of personal triumph."
3,A good read,"Jepthe's Daughter reveals much about a closed society. While the story flows dramatically and ends in triumph, the reader is somewhat conscious of final events. It's a good read and Ms. Ragen has opened the readers' eyes to a little-discussed problem within the Haredi community."
4,Gripping read,"I found this fiction both enlightening and startling. It was certainly a different view of Jewish life to mine. However, the struggles that each of the protaganists battled with showed a thorough understanding of the human condition. I thought Naomi's story line was superb, I couldn't put the book down."
5,Goats,"Here is a comprehensive, practical, and extremely readable volume for children to learn all about the wonderful creatures: goats. Learn where they came from, different kinds, how to raise them, and much more."
5,easy listening,"I highly recommend these tapes, particularly for older or extremely busy people. You can pop them into your cassette while driving or in cassette player at home and listen to them while you are doing your house work. They make studying the Bible much easier and relaxing. The acting on these cassettes ranges from excellent to average. Thankfully, they spent the extra bucks to get high quality narrators to protray the Father and Jesus. Though both are extremely valuable, the New Testament segments seem better produced than the Old Testament segments. Quite obviously, the original author deserves considerable credit. The tapes cover the entire Old and New Testaments, but do not include the Apocrapha from the Catholic Bible, as this is the King James Version. I bought two sets."
1,Terrible,"My son got this toy for Christmas from a family member and I put it together for him today. This toy is so frustratingly terrible that a one star rating is too high. Once you put it together and press the button on the remote control it falls apart immediately. The toy dances itself to pieces within seconds. It will not stay together no matter what I do. I will be returning this toy to the manufacturer, if possible. Avoid."
3,"Too optimistic, but a decent overview","This book paints a bright, sunny picture of the Utopia that will be created by the spread of communications technology such as the Internet. Work will become more fun, governments will be forced to cut taxes, people will talk to each other more, and world peace and prosperity will soon follow. I don't buy it; the analysis is far too one-sided, and, while there will doubtless be benefits of increased communication, there will also be downsides (though it's probably impossible to say what they'll turn out to be) and it won't fix all the world's problems, as Cairncross seems to think."
3,A what may occur in the Info Age diary,"The book is a good read if you are just beginning to learn about the Information Revolution. If you already know the author simply states the obvious: the Internet connects people to information, services and entertainment. Nothing new."
2,Bland,"Bland and simple. Writing style boring. No information a 5th grader couldn't figure out. Reads like instructions for programming a DVD player. Overly predictive with little supporting evidence. Like this review style? If yes, you'll like the book."
3,They only fit so-so,"Although they come in different sizes, the shape of your dog's face definitely effects how well these fit and how much coverage they give."
5,Memories from Fiedler,Its a pleasure to hear Boston Pops Orchestra conducted by Arthur Fiedler. The recording is excelent.
5,VERY GOOD ALBUM,Very good album with classic soft listening themes. I recommend it while eating or driving.
1,Not my mother's White Shoulders,I am very disappointed in the scent of the White Shoulders I ordered. Many years ago (over 40) I received White Shoulders cologne as a gift. It smelled wonderful and the scent lasted for hours. I opened this White Shoulders cologne spray and used it on neck and arms...it barely had a smell at all! It was a surprise-and not a good one. It seems a faint imitation of a once gorgeous memory. The company making White Shoulders should be ashamed!
4,mom loves it!,"This was purchased as a gift from me to my mother. I don't particularly love it,but she does and always has!"
4,White Shoulders set,"The products arrived promptly, and were in good shape when they arrived. I thought the shipping costs were a little high, but over all a good value for the money, and easy to transact."
3,welll ughh.......,ok so im a guy i purchased this item for my mom for xmas i took a wiff of it and frankly i didnt find it so appealing or sexy or nothing i made this purchase without even smelling it in department stores or nothing. I just went with my instincts and saw the reviews saying it was a great perfume for women and yada yada yada. If my mom opens this for xmas and takes a whiff and says she likes it ill see if i can change my review but if not i really dont reccomend this to any one and shipping took FOREVER it got here like at night one day late i was like WTF.
4,My wife's favorite,My wife used this cologne when we got married a long time ago.Whenever she is about to run out I replenish it for her. It is muchless expensive at Amazon then at some retail stores (that is if youcan find it).
1,complete bore,i can not begin to describe the utter boredom experienced while reading this book. i can not fathom how anyone would consider something such as a ghost who carries on conversations and does tricks for the family it is supposedly haunting a horror story.
2,Fall out!,"I bought these for a cartilidge piercing. I like small earrings, but these were almost too small to get in my ear. After 20 minutes, I finally got them in, but I could not close them. This was about 5 days ago and I still have not been able to close the darn things. I have already lost one because it fell out. I would recommend a slightly larger earring with a HINGE clasp."
2,Poor quality,"I bought 2 pairs of these for my second and third lobe piercings to wear on a daily basis. They were the perfect size, however, they were surprisingly hard to put in. The clasp was incredibly hard to get into the hole in 2 of the earrings.I've had them for a little under a month now and the silver is turning brown/black on the inside of the hoop in all 4 earrings. You do get what you pay for, seeing as they were so inexpensive. These might be good if you plan on taking them out daily. I wouldn't buy them again."
1,Ridiculously small don't be fooled by the picture,I have made a number of purchases from this vendor through Amazon and generally I have been pleased. These earrings are not suitable for an adult and indeed would probably be too small and too difficult to open for a child. I am returning this pair. They were inexpensive but I would not keep them even if they were free
4,hoops,"They came in a good amount of time, and look really cute. Thank you so much!! I will look here next time I need earrings."
4,Hey Guys,"I bought these earings for my 2yr old dtr. I think they were excellent value for money and small enough so her tiny fingers cannot pull them out. I would only recommend them for small children as they are very very small. All the same,I do like them!!!!!!!"
4,Sigma EF 500 DG Flash,I was looking for a Minolta flash but after reading about the Sigma I decided to give it a try. It was about 1/2 the price the Minolta and had more power. I like the way the flash sinks its zoom setting to my camera's zoom lens. The wireless feature is easy to use and gives a person quite a bit of flexibilty with lighting the subject. I'm still learning but so far the flash has done everything I expected.
3,Questionable compatability,"This is really nice strobe. I works great, better than expected with my FILM camera (Minolta 800si). It does not seem to like the Digital Camera (Minolta Maxxium 7D). I have to over expose 2 stops to get a usable photograph. I'm not sure if it is the programming of the camera or flash unit. With the wireless, it does not always fire all the flashes, or some fire prior to the shutter releasing. The 7D uses a double fired flash to get an exposure reading. Disable this feature and you might as well get out the old Manual camera. If you need a flash with these bells and whistles - buy a Konica-Minolta/Sony original."
5,Perfecto!,"I'd been looking all over for this particular key chain and was pleasantly suprised to find such a high quality, affordable item that arrived quickly. This made a great Father's Day gift!"
5,Great adventures and real life fun stuff to try,"I read this book over many times as a kid and used the companion book by Seton, Woodcraft, to build most of the things the boys in the book build. Lots of practical pioneer and American Indian culture. There are wonderful adventures and mishaps written from a kids point of view. Great for boys or girls. We built a real teepee from the dimensions in the book and camped out in it many times. I highly recommend it for kids and adults alike."
4,"Very good book from childhood, as good as remembered","I read this book as a preteen in the early 60s; I had good memories of it, and rereading it now, saw that it was as good as I remembered. Lots of woodcraft, and a very entertaining story of a boy's childhood in Canada. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,"Very classic, humorous veiw of shakespeare's funny side.","Very classic, humourous veiw of shakespeare"
1,BUGS Galore,"Who checks this product? Lots of bugs this year and no one to call. I've been using Turbo Tax for many years, but I think its time to find a new product (or dare I say it -- go to an accountant?). It is easy to transfer the prior year information which is why I haven't ditched it before. But the numerous problems with this year's ""enhancements"" have tried my patience."
5,Exceptional product,Able to handle all aspects of tax preparation. Easy to use. Almost makes taxes fun!
2,Not impressed,"This is not a very informative video on day trading. It is very repetitive, uninformative and slow. Definitely not worth the five stars in the original review."
5,Excellent Compilation!,"Features all of Randy Travis' greatest hits from the late 80's and early 90's. Also includes his latest hit, Three Wooden Crosses."" Sound quality is excellent; crystal clear. I highly recommend this great CD to any country music fan."
4,A true american treasure!,"Nobody else can interpret and sing a piece of music as Randy Travis. One of my favorites that he sings on this cd is: ""I had a little talk with Jesus."" Imus played this on his show one morning and it is now one of my favorites."
5,RT,This CD was in excellent condition and as it sounded very good. i am impressed with the cost and the quality of this CD as it was exactly what i was looking for in both cost and quality - thank you!
5,Pricky,"The combination of the steel Guitar and Randys one of a kind voice just might make this one of the best all time, must have album for the true country music fan, has a lot of his all time classics if thats what your into."
4,Randy now playing on the Paris Metro,"I do like Randy but this was actually bought for my friend who is Algerian / French and had to move back to Paris for awhile . Apparently hard to find Randy in Paris . . .His band plays Berber new age but after years of living in the USA , he became enamoured with american country music and Randy is his fave . He listens to it on the metro . . . NOW you know what is going through those earbuds on the Paris Metro . . . OK !"

2,Not to much info here...,"A nice collection of maps and general info, however, this title doesn't supply much more information than the NH Gazetteer. Can't speak as specifically to the VT and ME sections. Little info on when to fish, just general descriptions of how to get there and what may or may not be stocked. Really just a surface survey."
3,very average,"Initially interesting to a non-local; however after visiting northern New England, I feel the book is very average. Not up to par with some of the other regional fly fishing books, I felt it was quite lacking in the number of smaller streams covered."
5,Great for doing things quickly!,"Sure, if you know enough about Photoshop you could create many of these layerstyles, textures, etc. by hand. But why? It takes far less time and effort to load it off of a CD. The book includes photographic examples of the layer styles, actions, brushes, etc. as well as instructions and tips on how to use these tools. It is MORE than just a 'layer styles on a cd' book.For the price it is well worth it (I paid just over [price] for the book through Amazon).You can use this book if you have Photoshop 6, but certain actions may not work, and the brushes may not work. You need Photoshop 7 to fully take advantage of everything in this book, but it is still worth the price if you have not yet upgraded to 7.0 yet.I highly reccomend this book.Alex F."
5,You're gonna love this book and the effects it allows.,"It took me a while to get around to loading this program onto Photoshop 7 but after doing so I can't figure why I waited so long. It's easy to use and so-o-o forgiving. I particularly like being able to reset the copy and retain the total effect. Some of the effects are much better and more useful than others, but once you get past the fun of playing with the process it will save you hours in creative time and make your work more unique. A great investment."
4,a handy collection of instant f/x...,"...with an extreme temptation to overdo it. I remember the early days of ""desktop publishing,"" when suddenly we were given more fonts than we knew what to do with (literally) and by golly were going to use as many as possible in every single document we created. The same holds here. Effects in general (I'm not picking on these) should be used sparingly.That said, the [$] I paid for the book here at Amazon.com to have the catalog and CD will save me lots of time and provide both the inspiration and starting point for styles of my own."
4,Adobe Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow,"As an avid Photoshop user, I have been studying and using Photoshop since it started with Photoshop 4 and have moved up with every update. If you are famaliar with Photoshop's Actions, and Tool Presets, this book is probably not the one for you. The book will confuse beginners and be repetisious to informed users. The actual part that I did like is the easy way to edit text by using one-click instead of going thru all the steps. As for the other one clicks, I prefer to use my own methods. Still, as I collect all the Photoshop 7 books that look interesting, this is one that I will keep with my others."
2,Wrong size,Not knowing about fuse sizes I ordered this to go with the fuse holder I bought on Amazon. These fuses are large size and not the normal fuse size. Therefore they didn't fit in holder.
5,"Sony 27"" Flat Screen TV","I would love to get a great stuff with great deal!Especially Japanese items!As I have bad eyes,I need to get a good flat tv.It is just right size for my house and great qualityfor my job as I am working for a tv company!"
5,"Simple, lovely lullabies","This is a lovely collection of simple lullabies, sung sweetly by Julie Chapman. I first heard this CD at my son's daycare, and decided to purchase it after witnessing how quickly and easily it soothed the infants to sleep. Take special note of the title song...it always brings tears to this new mother's eyes."
5,A special gift to give to a special child,"This is a children's book...but it is more than that! This beautifully written and illustrated book has universal appeal, with messages for any age. When I read it, I thought at once of my grand children and how much I wanted this book to share with them. In addition, I felt I really wanted to share it with friends who, like me, appreciate true beauty in nature, the written word, and in fine art. As a former teacher, I recognize that ""Look About You"" is a special book that has the qualities we continually seek in a ""good"" book. You will want to own this book and savor visiting the ""wild places"" with someone you care about!"
3,An interesting concept,"This film caught me a bit by surprise. I had expected it to be a serious, full-on action flick in the same vein as Ninja Scroll. I was mistaken. While the film is loaded with action and some of the weirdest ninjas I've ever seen, many scenes are played more for laughs rather than drama.This is another film that I would not recomend for younger fans. There is quite a bit of blood, some nudity, and a couple of the scenes involving the construction of the puppets are quite disturbing.If you're a fan of ninja anime I'd take a chance on this one, but don't expect it to be on par with some of the more popular titles."
4,"Unusual, in a good way?","Like many, I'm not sure what to make of this one... It was odd. But I think that I liked it overall?There was a bit of blood and guts and some unabashed nudity, but nowhere near the gut-churning amount inApocalypse Zero(which I really DON'T recommend for ANYONE).The characters were at least interesting, and the animation was good in Puppet Princess. It was short, but sweet. And a bit out of the ordinary, for better or worse.If you like this one, you might also likeWrath of Ninja - The Complete Yotoden Saga,Ninja ScrollandSamurai - Hunt for the Sword."
3,AN AVERAGE ANIME,"This is a one time see nime.Its approximatly 3o min.The story is about an ex princess trying to get revenge on the king who took over her fathers land and get revenge on his puppets.The few comedy scenes didnt fit.The story isnt deep or touching and it focuses on japan and japanese literacy.If you havent seen it,i recommend you dont or watch it once, its not for everyday."
5,Great value,"My house is 17 years old and I had so many plugs that were loose and would not grip what was plugged into them. I have replaced about 10 of these so far without any issues and their ""grip"" is very tight."
4,A great double record,This is definitly stevie at HIS BEST!! But there are some filler like the instrumentals but the rest are wonderfull. I recommend it.
4,Never tire of this album after all these years,"I used to play this album over and over again. I still love all the music and it has held up all these years. I'm asking myself though whether or not to invest in the remastered cd or download my favorites as mp3 files, considering the cds price. I don't have high end stereo equipment so I may not even hear the remastered sound difference. At any rate the songs themselves are wonderful."
3,good reissue but not the best,"I buyed the Latest Japan not hybrid SHM SACD version (that is curiosly printed in just a single disc) and the sound is really better of any other previous releases in my opinion.This AF gold double CD is good but the difference is not so impressive if we compare it with the standard latest Universal remaster. I think there is a problem in the master that the labels uses to prepare the new remastering, probably not the real original master. The only way to produce a great sound improvent is to work on the original multitrack master like EMI did for the Beatles catalogue reissue. It would be interesting discover the real origin of the master used by the AF engineer to produce this version of the Wonder's masterpiece.Stevie Wonder's ""Songs In The Key Of Life"" is a seminar album and the new remasters are a good opportunity to rediscover the genius of this unique talent."
5,One Of The Greatest Double-Albums Ever,"I always wanted a Stevie Wonder album growing up, I would always hear his music in movies and everybody always had good things to say about his albums so as I got olders I had to do Research on Mr. Wonder and what I found out was astonishing the man has over 20 Grammy Awards, Classic Albums, Talented Musician, Great Voice to go along with it but there is one album during his Classic Period I find very addicting and that is Songs In The Key Of Life to make a long story short you will never really have to hit the skip button, this truly is his best album of his career but enough talk go and buy it U will be Amazed."
1,Original master tape,"Audio Fidelity does not use the Original master tapes on this and about all of the CD releases. They claim the sources they use are going to give the consumer a great sounding CD.If you're not using the Original master tape then you're comparing HDTV to analog TV.This version sounds very slightly better then the Motown release but compare the cost.I wish Mobile Fidleity would release this because they use nothing but the Original Master tape and the sound comes through.A great Stevie Wonder CD, but all of his CD's are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Songs In The Key Of Life!,"Songs In The Key Of Life is great album featuring so many good songs. The compositions are great, the production is flawless and the arrangements are top notch however when it comes to Double Albums some of them will contain fillers. This one does.Not that many songs on this album aren't good. 80% of this album is brilliant. However some of the tracks don't seem to belong there in the mix. Though lyrically they're good. musically they don't float and are often boring and I just wan't to skip the track and go to the next one.Other than that. Stevie Wonder created a fantastic album and if he had skipped some of these tracks he would have recieved 5 stars."
2,"Great Album, Poor remaster","Many people will look for the gold copy of an album to offer superior playback - it would be a given you would think. This is one of my all time favorite recordings. It has been butchered and sent back a notch by Audio Fidelity. Not sure what went wrong here - I compared several cuts back to back - The AF Gold and the latest Tamla remaster from Universal/ Motown on two players, Sony SCD 555 and Ah Njoe Tjoeb 4000. The dynamics are gone, the detail is down, the recording is veiled. To smooth a recording is acceptable - until you loose the dynamics.What a bring down. I would like to send it back.."
5,A wonderful album that you can enjoy again and again,"Once in a very long while, an album comes along that influences artists for centuries to come. Stevie Wonder's ""Songs in the Key of Life"" is one such album.Many of the songs on this disc were recognized by more recent artists and reused, including ""I Wish"" (Will Smith's ""Wild Wild West"") and ""Pasttime Paradise"" (Coolio's ""Ganstaz Paradise""). In commercials, Stevie's ""Isn't she Lovely"" can be found, and the soundtrack to the movie ""The Best Man"" includes the rousing ""As"".There isn't a single song on this album that made me reach for the Fast Forward or Stop button on my CD player. Listen to it once, and you'll be humming along; twice, and you'll be singing along; three times, and you'll be hooked for life."
5,Great album,Love this cd. Remember hearing it when I was a kid. Although the release is older than I am. The seller delivered the cd on time and I will purchase from seller in hthe future.
3,"Musically moving, innovative and original","I really only bought this for the magnificent ""I Wish"". I still marvel at the syncopated way that track begins, and works into a phenomenal groove. It's worth it for that alone. But ""Sir Duke"" with its unbelievable Tower of Power sounding sax's and trumpet section is a brillaint song as well. I bought the cover single that David Parton did of ""Isn't She Lovely"" back in 1976, and now I can appreciate the original.One thing worth commenting on is the superb production of the album and recording which is second to none. Although an analogue original recording it has transferred to digital remarkably well. Some albums fare worse showing up the hiss and noise of their original recordings. The instruments sounds incredibly ""tight"" and well produced."
3,Stevie's Finest Work,This two disc set is Stevie Wonders' best. It qualifies as one of modern R&B's finest recordings as well.
5,"I,TS WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","A masterpiece that five stars can,t begin to tell the true magic of this cd.From knocks me off my feet to sir duke to ebony eyes i can go on and on.This cd has got to be one of the best albums ever made if you have not heard this cd where have you been? enjoy!"
5,Brilliant,"I grew up listening to this album. From as early as I can remember, when my dad actually taught me how to use the record player, I would listen to this. It's absolutely brilliant from start to finish. Songs such as ""Sir Duke"" and ""I Wish"" are enormously popular, or were, and still should be. I absolutely love the Zappa-esque ""Contusion"" and things like ""Ordinary Pain"" and ""As"" are so completely heart-felt and true, that's it's impossible to compare it to something else. This is definately the absolute Holy Grail of Stevie Wonder's career and something that every musician who takes themselves seriously should strive to achieve. If you don't own this, you are cheating yourself. Buy it now and overnite express ship it. You will NOT be sorry."
2,Still undecided,"These candies have a good taste and they seem to be made from natural ingredients which is nice but they had a slightly stale texture, sort of chewy. I bought them for the office and had several people taste them and agree. They are supposed to have a soft middle so maybe the chewiness was by design. Unfortunately you have to buy six bags at a time so you can't find this out without making a bit of a commitment."
5,great,"fast shipping, great product, sounds like they were still recording! would order from these sellers again i love the rightous brothers and happy to add to my collection"
4,Bill and Bobby...You couldn't possibly mess this up,"Just some great tracks. Rock and Roll Heaven is one of my alltime favorites.I love the compilation, and how can you go wrong with the Righteous Brothers?Only one complaint- whoever did the remixing on the cuts seems overly impressed by cymbals.Someone evidently thought it a good idea to punch up the sound of a $500 set of cymbals over the voices of the finest tenor/barritone combo in rock history. It ruins Soul and Inspiration."
4,Good watch!!,I bought this for my mom last year and she loves it! She's had it for a year now and it still looks new (granted she takes good care of it) but it's a nice watch and I got it at a good price.
5,Excellent book! A must-have for ESL Learners,"I have spoken English for 9 years now, but my grammar and spelling were in bad shape. As an ESL student, this book helped me understand most of the complicated grammar rules. This book is concise, well-written, and developed gracefully. Although I have to work on my grammar and spelling skills, I would say this book improved my written communications by a 200%. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their writing skills."
1,Angel Tarot,"These are not the cards for someone that is just learning the Tarot. I was not happy at all with these cards and it was very hard to get the meaning out of such an awful drawing. If you are a seasoned tarot reader then these may be a little easier for you. To someone starting out I recommend the Robin Wood Tarot Deck, it is a great deck."
5,Good chair for bigger folks,"We purchased two of these chairs for office personnel that are in the 250lb range and it supports them very well. The bottom cushion is similar in size to a ""C"" sized Aeron chair. After using an Aeron chair for several years, mine broke at the bottom. I am going to replace it with one of these. If I get a few years I will be happy. It's well made and worth the extra $$ I think vs. some of the cheapies."
5,A magical collection of Joe Hisaishi's vocal songs,"This album contains newly arranged and recorded studio tracks of vocal songs spanning Joe Hisaishi's career, containing songs from his solo albums and also some songs from films such as Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service (Hush).Those already familiar with Hisaishi-san's solo projects will find a very rich and texturally deep selection of vocal tracks by the maestro, recorded to the utmost detail. The session musicians and orchestras are of the highest order and put in a very spirited performance, and the singers (most, if not all of which are American artists) are surprisingly competent (I say 'surprisingly' because I find a lot of western artists working in japan that are not well-known to be rather hit-and-miss to be honest).All in all a treasure of an album. Don't be put off by the reviewer below - if you are already a fan of Joe Hisaishi's solo work you will not be disappointed! 5 stars."
2,I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT,I loved Mr Hishaishi's music for the Ghibli Studio productions. I did not care for this album.
5,US Male is a scorcher,"U.S. Male by Kristin Hardy is a tantalizing follow-up to Certified Male.Joss Chastain feels responsible for the missing valuable stamp that was stolen. After all she hired the jerk that took them. She is determined to get the stamps back. But Joss needs help and hires a PI John ""Bax"" Baxter.John Baxter security specialist has just finished a big case and needs some major vacation time. In walks Joss Chastain in dire straights and all thoughts of a vacation leave his mind. Joss sweetens the deal by given Bax a taste of their chemistry.As the pose as lovers in Europe they are on the trail of some serious bad guys. As the danger increases, the sex with no strings changes into something much deeper.Kristin Hardy writes hotter then smoking hot. The steam just leaps off the pages. The emotional connection and intrigue grasp the soul and won't let go."
4,Who knew we were not first?,"Did you know that there was another race that ruled the Earth before humans did? No, not the dinosaurs, a highly intelligent race of sea creatures. They were amazing bioengineers who could change the life forms around them into tools for their own use. Turns out they put themselves in a state of suspended animation millions of years ago and have now awoken to find the human race misusing their planet. They are determined to put an end to it by using the humans own weapons against each other, causing humans to totally eliminate their own race. Can the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough do anything to prevent this? Should they, or would the Earth be better off without the human race?"
4,"Kodak Camera bag, Cobalt Blue","Good, sturdy little bag. If you buy this for use with the Kodak Easy Share V803, note that the camera fits in the bag only if you stand it on end and secure it with the velcro."
3,Damaged parts and difficult drawers,"Pretty piece, but the original shipment had 2, out of the 4, damaged drawer fronts. I've also had issues with the drawers not shutting all of the way, despite fairly good alignment of the drawer glides on the drawers and cabinets. The company provided replacement parts without issue, but had to wait another 2 weeks to finish construction and be able to use them. Not too difficult to put together--the longest process was screwing on the glides."
4,Will Do the Job...,"Instructions are not very clear but once together, this is a solid piece that does the job in my home office. Note - this item comes with the ""made in China smell"" to it, though I didn't like that it is of course made out of the US, I couldn't find another the same size and in the price range. I don't expect this piece to last forever but it will serve it's purpose."
3,file cabinet,had a paint smell for weeks. could not go into the room because of strong paint fumes It went away about 3 weeks after assembley
2,Lot of work to assemble.,"Every piece must be assembled, very time consuming. Drawers not very deep and unit is top heavy.I would not recommend buying it."
3,Looks great,I rate this a 3 star because there were missing parts with my order. Otherwise this filing cabinet would get a five star rating. It 's drawers slide effortlessly and the quality and sturdiness are fine. The instructions could have been more precise in showing how to construct the slides for the drawers.
5,Just what I needed!,"I love it! It was fun and easy to assemble, it looks great, and does what I need it to - store files! My office looks SOO much better now!"
1,NOT RECOMENDED FOR PURCHASE,"I SPENT TWO WEEKS THINKING ABOUT PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. IT TOOK ME ALL OF ONE DAY. BY THE END OF THE DAY, I WAS CONVINCED IT SIMPLY COULDN'T BE DONE BY THIS HUMAN BEING. IT PERPETUALLY FELL APART AT EACH STAGE OF INSTALLATION. CAM SHAFTS AND LOCKS GAVE WAY, THOUGH IN OTHER MODULAR FURNITURE I HAVE ASSEMBLED, THEY WORKED GREAT. I WOULDN'T ACCEPT THIS FILE CABINET AS A GIFT, LET ALONE EVER RECOMMEND ANYONE ACTUALLY PURCHASE IT. THE WOOD CRACKED IN SEVERAL PLACES, THE FRAME WENT TOGETHER CROOKED AND THE OVERALL PIECE IS SO HEAVY AND CUMBERSOME THAT IT IS NOT SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE WOULD EVER WANT TO TAKE ON."
3,The end result was worth the effort...,"The finished product is a beautiful and functional file cabinet with the necessary dimensions to fit in the available space. I would have given it a five-star rating if not for the effort involved in putting it together. Assembly would have been a piece of cake if not for the misfitting decorative piece, the so-called ""low panel"", which was cut too wide and prevented the cabinet from coming together properly. I ended up leaving it off. The only other option would have been to trim it down and repaint it. My other complaint is with the cheaply made castiron cam locks which are integral in pulling the piece together during assembly. Several failed during the assembly process. Luckily, my local Home Depot had the correct size in stock, and I was able to replace the cam locks and complete the assembly. I don't get it. Every other part in this package seems to be of excellent quality, but the cam locks are junk!!"
4,Good looking cabinet - wrong dimensions,"Looks really nice - almost like a piece of bedroom furniture, just its wider than the description says (description says 17 in wide - its really close to 21 in wide - the drawers themselves are 17in)"
5,Great buy!,"I went to Raymour and Flanigan, where I originally bought my office furniture, looking for a matching file cabinet. They had a file cabinet, but not a match and what they had was around $400. So I saw this one on line. The only thing that came close to this price had been metal. Yuck. I read some descriptions about how it was difficult to put together and not that great, but then others had liked it. So I gave it a try. It was easy to put together. Like Sauder furniture. It works very well. I think it's an incredible deal. And it looks like it belongs w/ my office furniture. I'm very pleased with the purchase."
4,nice piece,Piece was fairly easy to put together but a little time consuming. It appears to be sturdy and is working out well. I am happy with the purchase.
3,Belt Clip Middling,"As far as the case itself - great. As mentioned before, it fits tightly and protects the iPod's iSurface well. A great case if you want to stick the iPod in your pocket and get on with your iLife. My iBeef is with the belt clip.The belt clip is centered on the case, meaning that it is also centered on the iPod. Unlike Contour Design's belt clip for the first generation Nano, the clip is only about an inch long. This means that the iPod can see-saw when clipped to the belt. Not an issue if you are stampeding around with the rest of the iFlock, but if you are a runner or avid weightlifter (necessitating frequent ups and downs), the iPod might fall off.Also, the case extends a bit too far beyond the earphone iJack. I have to re-seat the earphone connector from time to time because of this. Maybe other earphones don't have this problem; iWouldn't know."
5,The Original,This one is the original book on packing. Everyone interested in the craft should have it.
4,Entertaining and Enlightening,"This charming book is sure to please anyone interested in good old-fashioned prose created around the subject of packing into the wilderness. Not only is the writing and story-telling fascinating, the artwork that accompanies each of the pieces is wonderful. Joe Back is not only a writer, but an artist, wildlife sculptor, a rustic poet, back woodsman, and most of all, a humorist.The book covers the method of packing into the wilderness for both the amateur and the professional. Most of the information in the book has never been written down before. Western Horseman magazine reviewed it as the ""greatest little book ever written on packing into the back country."" For my money, just looking at the detail drawings is worth the price of admission."
5,Essential,"I can't imagine my music collection now without ""Streak of fat, streak of lean"" or ""I got your ice cold NuGrape."" These two and others on this disc, and in this amazing series, are just fantastically fun, essential American music. I'm collecting the entire series and it has really caused me to seek out other authentic recordings from this period. Also check the essential ""Music From The Lost Provinces""."
5,Precious Lord,"A favorite already, I searched for this CD. It's as good as I remembered. Al Green's ""Precious Lord"" is an all-time classic. The combined two albums are great."
3,Lasted less than 4 months,"Bought this less than 4 months ago and the zipper for the screen door has already busted away from the material. Repeated zipping is not what this is made for. It is a functional greenhouse, but I'm already looking at alternatives just 4 months after the initial purchase, and Amazon is only willing to refund 50% of the initial price minus return shipping. This was not a good purchase for me.EDIT:Amazon replaced the greenhouse completely, however it is the same story in a different box. Thank you for the replacement Amazon."
1,What a waste of money!,"I set up this greenhouse to protect my roses from the harsh winters in Colorado. I have had it up since October and it is already useless. The plastic froze and cracked or shattered in about two dozen spots and the door no longer zips. This is a terrible product, and yet if I want to return it, I only get a 50% refund and I have to pay shipping. What a WASTE of money."
4,Ahead of its time.,"The author wrote this work some time before9/11 Terrorist attack. Even then, her well researchedcharacters had a very thin veil between Osama Bin Ladenand what the rest of the World now knows. Some of us werefollowing these events prior to 9/11.I read this book as I had been given copies of the Authors'prior works and enjoyed them. Read it the weekend of Sept15 and 16 Sept 2001. It was just here. And timly, I mightadd... Kat."
1,full but empty,"Yes, this book is full of addresses to so many different types of people. Unknown to us if the mail ever arrived to the addresses we used all we can say is we never received any replies to any letters we sent out. Quite disappointing."
1,Compilation of infomation found on the Internet,"Overall it had good information. The fact that it can all be found for free on the Internet is another item all together. If you don't want to spend the time online, or don't have Internet access at all, this book will be of benefit to you.Keep in mind addresses change frequently and they are all not guaranteed to provide a result."
1,save your money,"I waited months for this book and what a disapointment when it arrived today. The book is a total waste of money, just some black & white photos of U-Boats I have seen before. Large color photos of other builder's finished models, side profiles of boats I have seen else where, photos of parts and box art.No hints or information on building a Type VII U-Boat, ""THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS BUILDING A U-BOAT!"". Look on the net if your looking for hints to help build the perfect boat."
1,Cannot get this book new,"Don't bother ordering new from Amazon, I waited almost 3 months before they finally admitted they could not get this book. Order it used from somebody else."
5,A healing book for me.,"In the beginning, I found myself staying up till the wee hours in the morning unable to put the book down. It became a movie in my mind and the writing brought me through the emotions of anger, disappointments, tears, and ultimately joy. If you have experienced the devastation caused by adultery (the bitterness) and its effect upon the children, read this book. At times, the emotional anguish was recreated in me and I had to put the book down; still I felt compelled to find out what would happen next. The writer helps you heal though the actions of the characters in the book. It opened my mind and gave me a new perspective. This book changed me. My thanks to the author for being brave enough to remind us that Christians make mistakes and forgiveness is the answer and Christ will never leave or forsake us. In a hurting world, we need more books like this one."
5,Accurate story of Christian struggles,"As the daughter of a minister, I found ""Something that Lasts"" to be a realistic story of heartache and pain many Christians bring on themselves before submitting to the wonderful love and grace of Christ. Often church members look up to ministers and their families as the model and ideal of Christian living, without realizing that ministers and their families are simply sinners in need of the same mercy and grace essential to the people sitting in the pews each Sunday. This book is powerful and thought provoking. It is one of the few books that will challange you to become a better, more forgiving and loving person."
3,Feel is not quite right,"I got a wood bow, a carbon fiber bow, and this fiberglass bow. All about the same quality. Inexpensive. The wood one is decent enough for practicing and so is this fiberglass one, though it feels off. Balance is not the best and it seems a bit heavy. But it is as good as the wood one. The carbon fiber one I found actually pretty good."
5,Ellen Burstyn's best picture,"The movie on which all the TV shows were based, this is Ellen Burstyn's hard core, smart mouthing film about a woman whose husband dies, and she takes her son and goes in search of her dream of being a singer. Along the road of life, she encounters some fascinating people. The person who stands out the most is Harvey Keitel, who plays a mean, nasty husband who woos Burstyn and stirs her passions until his pregnant wife shows up. He kicks her out the door of Ellen's motel room while trashing the place, scaring the bejezus out of Ellen and her son. She moves on.Playing the piano and singing in lounges for meager pay, she meets Kris Kristofferson and falls in love. At this point, the only job she can get is as a waitress, where she meets a fellow waitress with a mouth worse than Ellen's. The restaurant scenes are hilarious, and the basis for the TV shows. It's one of those not to be missed films, filled with wisdom and cynicism."
4,When Marty Was Good,"An early Martin Scorsese film when the director was good, bringing out great performances with a sparce script.Ellen Burstyn is a hard luck wife with a wife-beating husband. The husband is out of the picture suddenly and she must make it on her own with her young son in tow. Burstyn's acting style, just short of bursting into hysteria at any moment, very interesting really.Harvey Keitel has a small part, but steals the show as usual. His cowboy accent is a little odd, but that actor can menace.A small cameo of young boy-like Jody Foster. What were her parents thinking? You could see it coming."
3,Good acting but a bit dated,"The Oscar-winning performance of Ellen Burstyn keeps you glued to the screen. However, the movie has dated a bit over the years and does not ""flow"" in the way that movies do nowadays - partly due to the script and partly due to the directing. Still worth seeing though!"
2,Disappointed with This one,"I should have known. Filmed in 1974 it has nothing to offer. I just watched it on Turner Classic Movies. Everyone is praising this film. How Come?? It is a dreary account of a widow trying to get to Monterrey Ca to be a singer. Her 12 year old son is a spoiled, obnoxious, foul mouthed brat and she is so naive it is ridiculous. She does absolutely nothing to parent her son, the problem being she is trying to be his friend, not his mother, which would NOT be typical behavior of a woman of her generation. It was disgusting. I will not be buying this one, I do not recommend it to anyone, unless it is to show how NOT to bring up a child."
4,Held My Interest,"The characters are well developed and have depth. The story line is interesting and has enough twists to make it worth buying not just borrowing. I found myself not putting it down until I finished the book. I've lived in Vegas most of my life, and believe the protagonist to be representative of many down and out in the industry. I've never experienced the South, but felt I got a true window to the South in this story. It was an enjoyable experience. I look forward to Schramski's next novel."
3,"Advertisements for Disney films, but has merits.....","Okay, these miniature board books are virtual advertisements for Disney films. But the books themselves serve a surprising utility in engaging children and first readers with books.For infants through two year olds, these are wonderful first short books for them to learn about what a book is. Simple pictures, five line stories, with a beginning-middle-end structure. Yes, your infant will ""get"" what a book is very quickly with these as part of his or her library.For slightly older children, while you are reading more complex books to them, you can let them try out reading a story to you with these simple and familiar stories.The board books are nearly indestructible, though Lord knows mine tried.I recommend them."
1,Rancid nuts,"One of the big problems with the black cherry bars are the almonds which have exposed meat in processing. The exposed portion of the nut goes rancid, even when fresh. YUCK! Skip this variety, unless you like that strong rancid taste."
4,This is a wonderful book.,"I purchased this book for someone else, but I'm going to keep it and get him another copy. Set on black pages with white writing, this book covers mountains, oceans, forests, valleys, and some very ethnic, old-world inhabitants of Columbia. It's large and very heavy; a definite coffee table kind of book. I'm very happy with my purchase; my only regret is that I didn't pick one with Columbia's cities in it also."
5,absolutly wonderful,"What a beautiful book. I got it for my husband and I am truly happy that that means it will not leave the house.The fotografs are super, half pages, full or often double. The first chapter is about the sea and underwater animals, later come mountains and people. And to remind us that the world as beautiful as Aldo Brando can show it to us is not save at all the last chapter shows the destruction people can do to our poor planet.The black background pages give the book a special look, paper and print are perfect.I am really happy with this, a wonderful view of the tropics!"
2,"what about*dorsey,bradford,cleveland,walker","Well,needed more thought who should have been on it m2k traditional and m2k contemporary 2 seperate cd's instead of one 2disc.ea.how can we forget the people who brought us to this point."
2,Uh Tom is not Boston,"I am a huge fan of Boston's first 2 albums. I saw this album at the record store and was very excited. I bought it out of loyalty without hearing a song on it. I really gave this album every chance. I really tried to like it. Bottom line is this CD will be collecting alot of dust. The first song is good but sounds just like Amanda. This song alone earns the 2 stars I gave this album. The rest of the album is a waste of space I'm sorry to say. I can't beleive it took what 7, 8 years to put this out. I won't be buying or even thinking about buying Corporate America. If you want somthing that sounds like bostom. Get the RTZ album. You won't be dissapointed. It's too bad but the real Boston with all the original members will probably never happen again."
2,This does stink...,"I've read most of the other reviews & some people are just too loyally blind to recognize this thing for what it is.... creatively bland. You've got to call the baby ugly sometimes. I'm a huge Boston fan & will always see them in concert when they come around, maybe these songs (if played) will translate better live than on record/tape/CD... just like KISS Rock & Roll All Nite on ALIVE & Thin Lizzy's Cowboy Song on Live & Dangerous."
3,Boston without Brad Delp? Gimme a BREAK!,"... as I listened to it in my car, I kept thinking: 'Something SOUNDS WRONG here...' and I finally opened it up and studied the credits and found the glaring problem: the album was recorded WITHOUT BRAD DELP. ... when you start to meddle with Mother Nature, well the outcome is 'Walk On'.Let's face it, even IF Brad HAD been the lead singer on this album, it would easily rank as their worst album--but without BRAD?? in this case, it just doesn't have that Boston 'feel' to it (at least not much) and you can't sell many albums like that, and it hasn't. To date this is Boston's worst selling release (even behind their greatest hits collection which came out AFTER 'Walk On'). What do I want? I want Brad Delp back where he belongs: IN the studio singing--and I am obviously NOT the only one. The dismal sales of 'Walk On' speak for themselves."
1,Just Get the 1st 2 CDs,"And if you are feeling ambitious, download the single of ""Amanda"" and burn both CDs pus ""Amanda"" to a blank 80 minute CD (for personal use only) and that is all the Boston you will ever need."
3,"From 1994, This Is Boston's Forth Album.","I am a big fan of Boston's self titled debut album from 1976 and the follow up, Don't Look Back, from 1978.Next came Third Stage, but I've not heard it so can't coment.Fast forward to 1994 and Walk On.I already knew three songs, I Need Your Love, Livin' For You and We Can Make Itfrom a sampler of five tracks of both Asia and Boston.I Need Your Love and Livin' For You could easily come from the band in the late 1970s, however I found We Can Make It and the remainder don't seem to be of the same quality.I recommend Boston fans check for themselves."
4,1994...,"i bought this on cassette the very day it was released. i honestly had no idea that brad delp wasn't on it until i started listening to the first few lines from ""i need your love"" and thought ""something doesn't sound quite right."" that's when i read the liner notes and discovered he was no longer the lead singer. at the time i was not happy. but this album grew on me quickly. sure, it's not the greatness of the first three albums, but it's still great. it also really helped that i bought and listened to this during a very formative time in my life. proof that music really shapes moments in your life. any time i listen to this i am immediately transported to that moment in time...june 1994.RIP brad delp..."
3,More like 3 1/2 stars,"Yes, having Brad Delp(R.I.P) on lead vocals would have been great on this album but sometimes things don't always work out the way you plan them. But a Boston album is not a Boston album without Tom Scholz who has always been the guiding force behind their success. While not the strongest album in their catalogue(I leave that to Third Stage)Walk On still has positives such as the Walk On Medley and my favorite, Magdalene which has a very catchy riff."
3,THE TITLE TRACK IS AWESOME!!!!,"I wasn't too sure about the CD when I first started listening but, with each additional listen it gets better and better. I especially like the title track, it has a hard-rock edge with the signature BOSTON guitar and organ riffs along with great vocals. A must have for rock and BOSTON fans alike."
3,Boston - 'Walk On' (MCA) 3 1/2 stars,"Review no. 69. Follow-up to Boston's 'Third Stage' album (see my review). Obviously their fourth lp in eighteen (18) years. I'm giving it a 3 1/2 star rating because after listening to this CD twice in one night, I believe Tom Scholz and crew gave this disc a full hearted effort. Tunes here that sort of grow on you are ""Surrender To Me"", ""Walking At Night"" (now, this is like the trademark arena rocking Boston I remember), title track ""Walk On"" and well written ""What's Your Name"", Maybe not a classic, but still worth checking out."
3,Walking On?,"""Walk On"" is a weak and disappointing effort by Tom Scholz, the creative genius behind Boston. It lacks all the things you associate with Boston -- creative guitar solos, great musicianship, and soaring Brad Delp vocals! 90% of the album was done by Tom Scholz, and, as a consequence, is quite bland. Also, the drum machine Scholz uses is terrible, especially on ""What's Your Name"" and ""Magdalene"".Only the first and last songs, ""I Need Your Love"" and ""We Can Make It"", have the successful Boston formula. Scholz needs more songs like these two -- with finger-picking, clapping, and catchy guitar riffs. Unfortunately, Walk On is not vintage Boston, but a weaker incarnation of a once brilliant band."
1,what a disaster,"I would like to say I'm a fan of this band but having only one good album to their (or Tom's)credit makes it impossible. The worst part about everything they've done since Don't Look Back is that it tries to ""sound like"" the Boston from the first two albums and that's just not a good idea creatively. Focus on the writing first and not the surface appeal. George Lucas made that mistake in everything after the first couple Star Wars movies and Scholz does the same. The difference is that Lucas probably could have done better. Boston reminds me of other artists like Alanis Morissette, who have their time in the sun but never really know what to do with themselves after their place in time is passed, but at least Alanis has done some occasionally decent soundtrack stuff. I can't see at all what others see here and I'm astonished at anyone giving it more than two stars. Stay away from this album..."
3,Worth a listen.,"Walk On is pretty good and sports talented playing, decent songs, and a nice production. While Fran Cosmo does get the job done vocally, Brad Delp still had the signature vocals that were part of Boston's sound. The songs that I think stand out are ""I Need Your Love,"" Surrender to Me,"" ""Livin' for You,"" and ""Magdalene."" Walk On is a worthy album from Boston, but I still prefer Third Stage to all of their other stuff."
2,Walk Away,"Tom Scholz is a perfectionist and he takes a tremendous amount of time recording albums. It took eight years to follow-up 1978's Don't Look Back with 1986's Third Stage. Along the way most of the original band left leaving just Mr. Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp, but those losses were easily overcome. In the seven and half years in between Third Stage and Walk On, Brad Delp left and this was no minor bump in the road. The secret behind the band's success was not only the orchestra of guitars but Mr. Delp's roof raising vocals. While Mr. Scholz replaced him with sound alike Fran Cosmo and a second vocalist, David Sikes, neither have the depth and range that match Mr. Delp and the songs suffer. There are a couple of decent tracks like ""I Need You Love"", ""Livin' For You"" and the title track but basically the rest of the album doesn't offer much."
3,Bleh,"Boston's Walk On sounds like a potentially good Boston album infected by predictable 80s hair metal. Some good Boston songs mixed with some songs that could have been written by any unambitious 80s metal band. We all miss Brad Delp, and that's bound to affect our view of Boston albums released after his death, but his contributions to Boston's songwriting is painfully and noticeably absent here."
4,underated!,"I think this Boston album was sort of underated. When my friend started jamming this cd at his house i was like "" hey this is awesome"" he was playing What's Your Name, which I think is one of Boston's best songs. Livin' For you is another great one. This album overall is ok but doesnt compare to Boston or Dont Look Back"
2,Another 8 years for this!,"Not one of my favorite Boston releases. 1994's ""Walk On"", hit #7, hard to believe since grunge was all the fad at the time. This album just doesn't cut it for me. They did release a few good tunes in their only chart single, with the galloping guitar chords of ""I Need Your Love"" #51 in the 100. And one of my favorites is the gooey ballad ""Livin' For You"" and the ""Walk On Medley"" #14 mainstream rock. The rest is forgettable junk. A greatest hits collection would come next in 1997."
3,Great Boston sound but...,"The fourth cd from Tom Scholz and crew has that great Boston sound, but seems to be lacking something. When I listen, it sounds good but just doesn't grab me. I suggest that if you're looking for an album from this great piece of rock and roll history, try Third Stage or the first one instead."
5,50 Amp recepticle,"Easy to install. Great quality innerds (connectors, screws, plates, stress relief) and cover. Don't think I've ever been disappointed with Leviton quality and this is no exception. Very good product for the money. Would definitely recommend to friends and family next time they need a 50 Amp circuit..."
2,The Curse[It wasn't The Farm when first saw it.],"I remember renting this movie and how I could't wait to see Wil Weaton in a horror flick.I was a bit disappointed in the boring plot in which he plays the wimpy hero.It's not that scary and may put you to sleep.So take a nap before you sit down to watch.I was being generous on giving it two stars but as a pre-teen[as I was when it was first released]I was a big Wil Weaton fan.If you are too,then stick to watching Stand By Me."
3,"MOSTLY BORING, BUT HAS ITS MOMENTS","I like the scene where the farmer thanks the lord for the apples, then finds out they are all filled with worms."
5,"Looking for the gift for that ""hard to buy for"" character?","This book will pull anyone out their daily boredom, depression, or malaise! Open this Hot Bold Orange and Black tome to any page and your mind will instantly be teased and tantillized. You will be seduced into having new thoughts, pondering thrilling actions, and scheming brilliant real life adventures! No idea is too crazy or impossible for the mind to chew on, and this book is the ultimate giant pack of juicy fruit! It has 365 pages of delicious fun inside."
4,A page-a-day funfest,"Not really a life changer, but you might have to change your underpants from laughin so much. Don't try all the recommendations in this book unless you have a good attorney."
4,Not for serious reader -Awesome Book!,"I bought this book for the reason I am retiring next month. Perfectchoice. You will laugh, mess-up or even get mad!!! The wholephilosophy of this book is to enjoy & think about that ""Life is too short""-- cheers!Highly recommended, period"
4,Great Gift for the person with a Sense of Humor,"This is a great book. It's hilarious if you have a sense of humor or know someone who does. Just doing a few of the activites in the book brings back your childhood and makes you laugh. It's just a good time book. Even if you buy it just to lay around on your coffee table, it's a good ice-breaker! Enjoy!"
2,Hasn't changed mine yet!,Disapointed - this is a good 'couple of pages a sitting' bathroom read of occasionally amusing stuff. Perhaps a week's worth of quality turned into a year with silly suggestions and pictures! For a life changer I'd go with Danny Wallace's Join Me
3,You better be ready to spend some money,"This book was fun to start, but the farther I got into it the more I realized I need time and money to do most of the day to day assignments in it. As fun as most of them were or sounded, being so busy with my school schedule and little money this book just started to suck. So before you buy this, make sure you're ready to book your trip to France."
5,this book WILL change your life,"this book is amazing. i did so many things that i would have ever done otherwise. i have become more confident as a person, inside ad out. i recommend this book to anyone whose life seems mundane and repetitious. i look forward to every new day as a challenge with this intriguing book. it's awesome!"
4,It's OK,"I found this book at a local Urban Outfitters at nearly double the price here on Amazon. After spending a few minutes at UO, skimming the book, I thought it'd be a fun challenge to try to go all 365 days and complete all the things they tell you to do. I found some of the things in here a little strange, but I guess that's how they get you to ""change your life"". I found myself forgetting to do these activities after a couple weeks."
1,Numbingly terrible,"I had high hopes for this book, if for nothing else, then as a chuckle-inducing bathroom read.I must say, I was gravely disappointed. The book literally did not elicit a single laugh from me, and most of the ""suggestions"" would only lead to you quickly becoming the supreme village idiot. The only reason I read the entire book was because I just had to know HOW bad this book could get. Quite bad, indeed, it reminds of a train wreck: so bad you just can't look away.Now, I consider my self to have quite the sense of humor, yet this book just did not deliver on any level. If you consider yourself levelheaded, I'm sure you will agree.If you want to read some real good chaff, go ahead and get this book. My copy is in the trash. I'm ashamed to have owned it."
4,Weird but humorous!,"Some of the stuff is just gross. Yet again, this is not for kids! A grand majority is funny or amusing or even informative. A cool book to use as a guide for when you are feeling bored."
4,Inspiration!,Hilariously unique book. Gives you great ideas about life. Not sure I would actually try most of the instructions but it's sure fun to think about what would happen if I did. The illustrations and photography alone are worth getting this book. I consider it one of my nontraditional design references.
3,"""this book will change your life""","This book is a little weird.... I saw the author had other good books, but i picked this one bc it was the cheapest..... little did i know it was ALL pictures...no reading to it...but I still think some parts are funny, and kinda crazy. I def. want to read other books by this author."
1,Poorly Done,"These are poorly executed performances, lacking professional-level tuning, tone, and balance. All of this music is better performed elsewhere."
5,Great canning cookbook,I got this from the library to see what it was like and fell in love with it. My mom liked it a lot also and it took me weeks to get it back from her.
5,FARM JOURNAL'S FREEZING AND CANNING COOKBOOK,Fast delivery and just as described. This book is an old friend to a young bride of many years ago that never made it through the moves. I'm so happy to have a copy for so reasonable a price. It is the most practical and inclusive cookbook in my stash.[One on-line antiques dealer offered it for over a hundred--what a joke]. Thank goodness for sellers like your Amazon folks!
5,Best basic freezing and canning,I have used this for 30 years. Best for basics on freezing and canning.great relish recipes. JDB NYC Minneapolis
3,dissapointed,"This book hooked me from page 1. I didn't want to put the book down. My rating is only a 3 because I feel that the book fell apart in the last chapters. While, I like happy endings, this book wrapped things up in hardly more than a paragraph."
2,Unfair expectations?,"Larry Bird was one of the greatest forwards to ever play the game. He was blessed w/great physical skills as well as an unbelievable work ethic. He shares his life story about his humble origins to his rise to worldwide celebrity. Unfortunately the book is poorly organized and poorly written. It's written in an overly simple manner and needed more personality. It reminded me of Larry's game, solid and fundamental but not overly flashy. I guess I was looking for a more entertaining book, and not a simple recounting of his life. The book could use more personal anecdotes and behind the scenes sharing. Overall, I was disappointed and wanted much more."
4,Great story....Poorly told,"to any larry bird fan this is a very good book. if you play basketball it is ok. And if you are just an average reader who reads this book for whatever reason, then this book is Ok. The story without a doubt is inspirational to young basketball players, however the story is weakened by its lack in structure. bird constantly bouces from subject to subject in one paragraph. The book is definetly worth a look."
4,Good read for Bird fans,My 12 year old son enjoyed this book about the life of Larry Bird. I purchased this book for a very low price & it was money well spent. This book will stay on his shelf for years to come.
4,LARRY BIRD SCORES ON THIS BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS A GOOD READ ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE NBA SUPERSTAR. MOST OF IT'S CONTENTS ARE CONCERNING HIS CAREER, HIS LIFE OFF THE COURT IS MENTIONED VERY LITTLE BUT THAT IS WHY IT IS CALLED A PRIVATE LIFE. HE DOES A VERY GOOD JOB GOING THROUGH HIS LIFE IN BASKETBALL MENTIONING HIS OPINIONS AND INSIGHT ON SEVERAL OPPONENTS, TEAMATES, COACHES, AND WORK ETHIC. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS EASY READING AND INTERESTING STORY. JUST WISH IT WAS A BIT LONGER. RECOMMENDED FOR ALL NBA FANS."
4,High Visibility,"Really like this vest. I bought it for high visibility while riding my motorcycle. It is very bright and stands out nice. The reflective strips are super bright. The only complaint is that these vests run small, so get one two sizes bigger especially if you're going to wear it over a jacket."
2,Not as good as the first season,Not as good as the first season. The NASCAR themed episode made me want to shoot myself in the eye. And it's streaming on Netflix now.
4,Easy to watch.,This not a great cop series but the cast is well put together. Everyone is likeable.You can be sure someone will find a 'body' or 'body parts'at the beginning of each episode.The lead Jim Longworth is probably the kind of guy many of us would like to be and the kind of guy many women want. Part of his charm is wry wit and subtle sarcasm. What's not to like.Everyone in this series is somewhat vulnerable. Perhaps we sense that and for that reason we relate to this series. They do MINUTIA in a way that many of us can relate to....ie when his girlfriend tells Longworth's character about her day at the hospital and about a female Dr. that is giving her a rough time.This is not a gritty series and is suitable for most family viewing IMO.It has most of the elements of a decent series...drama...humour...romance.
2,Big Mistake Making the Whiny Girlfriend a Co-Worker,"The whiny, self-righteous girlfriend is ok in small doses, but the ridiculousness of having Jim's boss tell him to stay away from her and then turning right around and hiring her as a 'forensic nurse' - really? I am midway through the second season and if the writers don't cut back on her intrusions and preachiness, I am done watching after this series."
1,Preachy; liberal slant.,"Season 1 was great and I couldn't wait for season 2. I'm about 3/4 through season 2 now and found it to be slanted and preachy. In particular, Ep 9: Iron Pipeline & Ep 10: Swamp Thing. Ep 9 - Oh noes guns are bad! Unless cops have them. Apparently if you are a liberal cop that hates civilians having guns, you get the freedom to assault a buff dude buying an AK in a sporting goods store. That's ok, it's probably just because he's some back country redneck, so all is forgiven. Which brings us to Ep 10. How many times did they snidely refer to ""swamp rats""? Hey, those rednecks are dirty and live in the swamp shootin animals and not buying their meat at the store. GIT EM!PS - Please stop asking the question ""why do {you/they} {need/want/have} [insert firearm]?"" It is annoying and not a valid question."
5,Excellent series,The second DVD in the series. A hit on A&E tv. It's a don't miss show for me. Added to my collection.
5,LOVE IT!!,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHOW! I love crime shows, and this by far is one of my favorites. The characters are witty and intelligent. My only complaint is there aren't enough episodes!"
5,Great Entertaiment ! ! !,So neat to have a cop show with a twist. The Glades is such a great show. I saw one episode on TV one night when i was on a trip. Came straight home and logged on to AMAZON to hunt for the show. Downloaded both seasons and it has become the new favorite at my house. My wife and teenage son and I have watched one episode every night and now we are waiting for Season 3 !! Love this show and love Amazon. Awesome.
3,Show is passable- but can't make me buy a KIA- Ever!,"The show by itself is okay, some episodes better than others, but I have never seen such blatant product placement anywhere. When the dialogue in the episode (mostly in the second season) deliberately steers (no pun intended) to the features of a character's KIA SUV and another character is holding up a bag of reese's pieces in a way that is slightly more subtle than having a big neon sign over his head, something has to be wrong. Aren't legitimate commercials every eight minutes enough? This is tacky and it takes away from the show, which is too often predictable and needs all the help it can get."
5,GREAT PIECE OF MUSIC HERITAGE!,I just listened to my copy of Feuding Banjo's that I just received. What a GREAT musical experience it was! A beautiful blend of foot stomping and toe tapping of some of the best banjo music that we all have come to love over the years. The artist's renditions were exactly what I was hoping for when I purchased this banjo collection clasics on CD. GREAT BUY and well worth the price if you love banjo bluegrass!
5,One of the best golf movies out there,I have recently started playing golf and over a couple of months i have bought several dvds to help me learn. this is BY FAR the best dvd there is out there. i have also let several other people watch it (from beginner to experienced) and they say the same thing!
3,Decent instructional video,"I found some useful ideas and techniques here, but given Phil is the king of the short game, I really thought the materials would go deeper into how to build a solid short game. The real depth is focused on putting and how to practice putting to improve. The rest of the materials are useful, but kind of like a video version of a Golf Digest tips article."
3,Cool Video but not for everyone,"Phil is amazing with the short game, he shows some pretty cool things in this video.The average golfer will never be able to take advantage of his technique.Just my thoughts."
2,90% Marketing 10% Substance,"The two disk package is not worth the money!!! There is very little substance as it relates to game improvement instructions. I was surprise at the lack of game improvement information on these two discs. Before buying the discs I read numerous reviews. Needless to say, I am more than disappointed in the product!The one good point is the fact Phil has a lot of personality and very likable. Unfortunately, that doesn't help my game any. With the hinge and hold technique you will get the ball in the air but controlling the distance and speed is the problem. I would only use the technique if I want to lay up out of very very deep rough."
5,Inspiring and effective.,"As a beginner golfer I really appreciate the simplicity, clear/concise instruction and passion for the game that Phil shares in this DVD. I am now practicing like a pro and inspired to improve my short game. I sank 4 one putts in a row from a distance in my first round after watching it and practicing a bit. Brilliant DVD!"
2,Golfer Beware,"When I look at a two-disc set, I expect two discs full of instruction. Well, Disc 1 does present lots of tips for putting and chipping. But Disc 2, except for a brief segment on bunker play, is mainly an infomercial for the set, 2/3s of the disc devoted to great short game shots Phil hit during tournament play and some behind the scenes, self-promoting footage.Just be aware that you're really only getting one disc of instruction for your money."
3,Disappointing,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this video. Not much substance and not a lot of production value. Just because something works for a golf pro who has been playing golf since childhood, doesn't mean it will work for most golfers. For example, I suspect the ""hinge and hold"" is not great for most amateurs. I think this severe hinging introduces a lot of error and most amateurs will be able to do it well. No one advocates the severe hinge and Mickelson uses. Most golfers who try this will wind up decelerating as the club head approaches the ball. Just go the golf channel and watch instructional videos on chipping. Brad Brewer, Tom Watson, Rich Beam, Annika Sorenstam hardly hinge and most advocate chipping with a putt-like swing with the club finishing low. This technique will be a lot easier for 99% of golfers. On a positive note, I did like the way he explained how to set up after opening up the face of the club."
5,Hinge and hold works!!!,After watching this video a few times and taking the included booklet to the range I can honestly say that I have lowered my scores by at least 5 strokes!! I'm not afraid of bunkers or even a flop shot. Best 15 bucks I have spent on golf.
5,Brilliant,"I have been an avid follower of golf instruction for many years. Some of the information and insight here from Mickelson is brilliant and won't be found in any other instructional material from ANYONE. His explanation of his flop shot was so simple it made me sick!! If this doesn't improve your game, give up."
4,Phil Mickelson..short game secrets,"This is a well produced golf instruction video. Shot concepts are simplified and well demonstrated, it was easy to go and practise the techniques after watching the video.Excellent product and good value. Taken shots of my game."
2,Secrets of the Short Game,I expected so much more instruction on short game technique...glossed over the most difficult shots from 30-50 yards...average golfer doesn't need the ridiculous never going to be used shots...too much feeding of Phil's giant ego...very disapointing CD.. and very expensive.. considering the limited instruction
2,"More like ""secret"" of the short game","I was really disappointed with this DVD. The program consists of 2 sections, putting and chipping. The reason I bought the DVD was for the chipping. Basically, Phil shows how he chips without going into much detail about it. That's because he chips ONE WAY FROM EVERYWHERE. He explains that he had a chipping green in his back yard and grew up practicing all the time. That's it! Great for him, but didn't help me much. Better to get Dave Pelz short game instruction (if you want instruction). There are also some of Phil's trick shots, but I could have seen them on YouTube. Actually, I could have gotten all of the benefit of this DVD by seeing the clips on YouTube."
5,"Pricey, but well worth it.","I balked at buying Phil's DVD in the PGA store for $50, but bought it here for less.Worth every penny - Phil's (and Dave Pelz) approach is remarkably simple. And Phil does an excellent job of explaining what he's doing & how he does it (and also what he is not trying to do). His verbiage is clear & concise & easily understandable. OBW, so far, his ""hinge & hold"" approach seems reliable on the course too.I think any skill level could benefit from this DVD. This DVD is a good value vis-a-vis a lesson with pro - I can re-watch it later."
3,Video Problem,Video breaks down. Looks like a red tinted negitive for 5 to 10 seconds at a time. This happens two or three times on each disc.
1,Wrong Region,"It surprised me when I received the DVD and tried to play it that it was only to be played in Region one (US) and the order was delivered to Europe [...]. I have an old laptop which has no region restriction and as such, I was able to watch the DVD in lousy quality ... Five stars to Phil and his secrets, one star to Amazon for not understanding international business."
1,Phil Mickelson: Secrets of the Short Game,I bought the video on May 7 and as of June 3 have not received it yet. I am very disappointed!Ralph Monge
5,Fantastic Golf Instructor,This is the best golf DVD you can buy. It would be worth it at 10 times the cost. Phil is an outstanding instructor and can deliver his knowledge in a fascinating manner. Of couse he can make any shot look easy but he really explains the concept behind the shot.
3,Not Bad,"Interesting insights into how Phil approaches the short game. I've been able to incorporate some of what's included in the video into my game but ultimately you have to practice, practice, practice. Even Phil points out in the video how how his dad built a green in his back yard when he was a kid and he spent hours working on his shots. There are some very good tips in the video but the video alone won't fix your short game."
3,Slow but steady,"You'll have to get used to the slow pace of this film, but somehow, after awhile, you won't notice it. I wish I could better understand the director's overall vision, but suffice it to say it will hold your interest despite the lack of plot and action. Very unique. Unfortunately very bad cinematography. The darks are too dark and the soft fuzziness just serves to make it harder to view. But even so, the psychological interest is there.The few characters (the very unhappy young woman and her sordid father, and the grieving man) won't be taking you by the hand over to the pile of their troubles so you'll have to go alone and sort through them yourself. That's the unique vision, I think."
4,This stuff is awesome,We received a sample of this where I work. We tried it and really liked it. My hands and my sisters hands get so dry they crack and bleed! You don't need a lot of this and its not greasy. I would recommend this to anyone who wants smooth hands.
1,America The Horrible,"Seeing this documentary it leaves you wondering who were the bad guys in this war. It thoroughly trashes America. Ken Burns took great pains to paint the US as this awful, racist country. He doesn't explain the fears and mindsets of the time. The narrator goes on and on about how badly the blacks & Japanese Americans were treated, despite them serving. It is a constant theme in every episode. Ken Burns is definitely a hardcore, left wing propagandist."
3,Can't really give it a rating yet because I purchased for my husband,"I am sorry but I can't put a rating on it yet. I didn't want to be biased either way so I just put 3 stars. It arrived on time, but I am planning on giving to my husband for Christmas. He is a history buff, and loves reading and watching about the war.You will have base your purchase on others who have already watched for an honest opinion.ThanksCindy"
5,The War - Amazing Documentary of WWII on Both Fronts,"My husband and I are fascinated with this World War II documentary! We both have fathers and uncles who fought in this war. We are grateful to have actual footage of both the European and Pacific fronts. The voice-over is superb and the film is a must see for everyone who wants to understand this war, and in fact any war. It makes one quickly realize that there is no 'good war'..."
5,Well Trusted,"Everything came in perfect condition, at a great price. I recieved it in a very timely manner, thanks!"
4,Gift,"I pruchased this after my husband was so intent upon DVRing all the episodes on a PBS chanel. He was thrilled, now he can watch it when ever he wants! Great for the war history!"
5,Very Powerful,This is an amazingly powerful documentary. It is one of the best made wwii docs I have seen in a few years.
5,outstanding epic,The War is probably the best of all of Ken Burns epics. Whatmakes this so outstanding is that those telling the story arestill alive and following 4 towns through the war makes thewhole film wonderful and a real classic
5,For All Our Fathers,"I just finished watching the final episode of The War. My father, who served in Africa and Italy, as well as Korea, passed away January 19th of this year. I am so sorry he and my mother were not here to watch this extraordinary documentary. As much as I loved them both, I never knew what heroes they and all our parents were for their courage and bravery during the war years. Thank you, Ken Burns and team, for making sure their stories will never be lost."
5,History lessons,"I watched the first part of ""The War"" last night and couldn't believe my eyes. It saddens me deeply when I saw the pictures of dying soldiers. I almost never watch war films, but this one is so touching that I'm buying the complete DVD set for my two daughters to watch. Great history lessons we can all learn from this film."
5,Thank you,"This film should be in high schools, it would help educate our future on what our past had to give for them."
2,"Mis-marketed: Should have been part of ""The American Experience""","I think most of the reviews here reflect that people came to this documentary with very different expecations. Many were expecting a thorough history of WW2, which is wasn't, and probably didn't intend to be. But Burns made things worse by being inconsistant himself as to what the documentary was about. I think the piece should have been heavily edited and shown as a part of ""The American Experience.""My added complaint, though is that I think the material was presented with too much over-ripe emotional manipulation (ala Spielberg who never trusts the material--or his audience--or both!) The series didn't let me decide for myself that this material was powerful--I had to be hit over the head with a hammer to make sure I knew it was!"
5,The War-Ken Burns,I bought the book first. Then after seeing other videos on PBS by Ken Burns I knew I had to have this DVD. I wasn't disappointed. Outstanding film.
5,Incredible film.,"This is an incredible look at World War II, by a master film maker. My son and I watched this as part of our World History course and I highly recommend it. Moving personal stories about the men who fought and the women who supported those men and the war effort."
4,WAR IS HELL,Ken Burns is a genious when it comes to telling the stories of America. Here he takes on WWII. He really hits home. It shows the war not just from a military look but a human look at those at home. It tells the tragic tales that only war can bring. It celebrates the human and american spirit as we see and hear from those that gave there all to protect our country and stories of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.
3,"Excellent, but...","In the initial TV presentation, the wrong home town was given for the five Sullivan brothers of Waterloo, IA, who died together when the USS Juneau was sunk. It is a well-documented event which changed military policy, and not to state information correctly is egregious, in my opinion. Perhaps, as an Iowan, I am especially sensitive.Excellent, as are all of Mr. Burns' projects. The omission disappointed me; hence the lower rating. If this has been corrected since, I am not aware."
4,Very informative,"As a history professor for 35 years, I feel that Burns' chronicle of WWII in this format is excellent. It focuses on the effect that the war had upon individuals. Both those that fought in the war and family members who waited at home, are represented in a clear and engaging way.Using three different areas of the country as a background is an excellent way to personalize the war and draw us into these experiences and feelings.The sacrifices made by those on the home front, as well as those who served, enable us to relate to these experiences in a way that other documentaries have not done as successfully."
5,Worth 14 hours of your life,I think this should be required viewing for all high school age children. It would give them a perspective on life and what it took to make this country what it is (or was). Amazon has the best price on it.
5,Sorry I'm late!,"Thanks for the reminder, and I'm sorry it's taken me so long to review. This was a gift for my kid brother, and it came in plenty of time for me to wrap it, even though I waited too long to order it. It looked great and I have heard no complaints from the sibling, so must assume that it works well, too! I'd be glad to shop with this newcomer again."
4,Good But Not Great,"As a major history buff, I enjoyed this Ken Burns documentary on WW2 and I recommend it. There's alot of great war footage never seen before. Also, there are many excellent war stories that bring home the horror and brutality of war.However I have 2 criticisms. I felt that that focus on the four towns was ponderous and caused the film to drag at times. Also, I would have liked it better if there was less human interest/home front coverage and the documentary was shortened to ~ 4 DVDs, instead of 6.Overall, this is worth watching but not great like Burns's Civil War documentary."
3,My fathers war,"My father was a combat engineer: Company C, 7th Combat Engineer Bn., 5th Infantry Division (General Pattons Red Devils), XX Corp, 3rd Army. He had wonderful stories, of the bravery of men under fire, when you could get him to talk about the war. The home front stories were very touching to the heart, but I wish Ken Burns would have covered more of the battles in each Theather. The real story should have been about the men who put their lives on hold to go fight and die in foreign lands for the most noble of reasons, freedom and liberty. The film should have been more about them."
5,An enduring masterpiece!,"This is a masterpiece, and is already changing the way the American people think about WWII. Although I had already seen the series on PBS-TV, having the DVDs is well worth the cost, since the supplemental material is such a rich resource."
5,"Ken Burn's ""The War"" on DVD.","As with everything else I've seen that was a Ken Burn's production, ""The War"" was an excellent series. I loved the way the story was told on a very personable level, either through the words of the combatants or those on the homefront. With every passing day, more and more of these people who experienced this conflict are being lost to us. It was a pleasure to hear from these people in their own words before their stories are gone with their passings."
4,"Watch, then visit the WWII Museum in New Orleans, LA","Thorough documentary of WWII and its affect on America through the stories of families and veterans from four United States cities. The series is long -- similar to Burns' National Parks documentary -- but satisfying. I watched this series after visiting the WWII museum in New Orleans, but if I had it to do over I would watch the doc first to prep myself for the excellent museum experience. The design of the documentary and the museum are similar (small booths located in the museum that recount personal stories) though the museum emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi and Imperialist Japanese armies a bit more effectively. The documentary covers the same content regarding the cruelty of the enemy yet lacks the impact the museum had. Ken Burns's style is a perfect match for the national parks and not quite as great for WWII, but still a worthwhile documentary overall."
1,"""AMERICAN RACISM DURING THE WAR""","By changing the proportions of actual events, Burns rewrites history. Now, if he'd called his film ""American Racism During the War"" instead of ""The War"", he would at least be honest, and the film would be more credible as a history.The definitive documentary on World War II isThe World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)by Jeremy Isaacs. Being admittedly slightly Anglo-centric, the series is believable as a history.Just remember proportion. The War (not The American Racist War) was overwhelmingly centered around Germany's desire to conquer the Russians - 20 MILLIONS of whom were annihilated, not about a handful of mistreated American Negros."
1,The War: Film by Ken Burns,"The first two segments, Disc One and Two were defective.How does one get to talk to a 'complaint department?'Poor merchandise for 70 plus dollars."
2,The War begins without most of the world,"Two episodes into The War & I can find absolutely no cohesiveness in this film.Prereading about this series, I read that the producer's viewed over 1000+ hrs. of film. So far a lot of it is stock footage & readily familiar. My disappointment only increased when seeing a German unit at Stalingrad, exposed backwards, or the narrator trying to describe the invasion of Poland with scenes of murdered peasants. This short clip, these dead peasants, were filmed in the Ukraine in the summer of 1941, almost two years later.With these examples, there is a lot to be desired not only in content, but quality control.The producer's have mounted a inward-looking narrative, & so far are succeeding. K. Burns & co. like mirrors, & because of this lose any hope of capturing the true reality, the real scope of something so enormous as WWII.Ken Burns has made premium Americana, but now he's decided to try & go international; I'm afraid The War just won't cut it."
3,It Always Comes Down to Race,"All of Burns' epic films have race relations as a central theme. With over 50 million killed in WWII, to make this movie largely about how blacks and Japanese were discriminated against is questionable at best. We get it already: Discrimination is a bad thing. Half of the Baseball movie was about the ""tragedy"" of the Negro leagues. The Civil War justifiably had the exploitation of slaves as a central theme. Why make this movie as another vehicle to beat us over the head about the sad history of race relations? Burns should just do a project called 'Racism' and get it out of his system already."
1,America Won WW2,"I have no argument with this being an Americacentric series-even if they did come in, as usual, 2 years late but why does it neglect or underplay the allies role? American victories are portrayed as such but non american victories (yes,there were some) are depicted as allied victories. The link up between Russian and other allied forces were described as 'American and Russian' yet clearly there was a British (soldier holding Union Jack)contingent.Where were the Australians mentioned or given adequate credit-they did after all stop the Japanese in New Guinea. For a series titled ""The War"" it should be more inclusive-after all the war started in September 1939 not December 1941."
2,In A Word...TEDIOUS,"The war footage and comments by the survivors are riveting, but there's way too much (repetitive) filler in every episode. I have yet to make it thru a 2 hour segment without dozing off. I had to resort to taping the episodes and fast-forwarding thru the ""homefront"" portions. Glad I decided to watch a few episodes before buying. I think I'll just edit out the fluff from my tapes instead."
5,ANOTHER TRIUMPH FROM KEN BURNS,"After all the documentaries available about the Second World War, one would think there's nothing more to be added of interest. But Ken Burns has hit upon a most original and imaginable approach, by focusing on men from four American towns stretching from coast to coast. This serves to personalize the service experience, and we become involved in their lives and their fortunes. Burns intersperces his individual histories with footage both rare and known, and introduces a haunting melodic theme, ""American Anthem,"" which ties the whole together. ""The War"" is a fitting companion piece to Burns' ""The Civil War,"" and both belong in the libraries of caring Americans."
5,The War - A Film By Ken Burns and Lynn Novick,"Beyond my expectations. Ken Burns never skips on details. This film shows all the gory details of the real ""War"". It makes you appreciate what our troops went through so our great USA could be free. I am proud to be a free American and have a right to vote thanks to the heros shown in the film ""The War"". Every American should see this film."
5,The War,Great movie about THE WAR. Things Shown I never knew before!Good for education and History!!
5,Achieved its goals well,"The documentary has achieved its goals well. It never set out to be a definitive history of WWII so trying to compare it with other documentaries such as `World at War' is not fair. Yes it is American orientated, but it clearly defines that at the start and never tries to be anything else.Looking at the various campaigns and finding the errors in the military command is a fair assessment as it is all done from hind sight. To claim that the campaigns were executed with excellent precision and divine clarity would be ridiculous. I think there have been few if any military campaigns that have been performed successfully in a test book fashion and WWII is no exception. All side made monumental mistakes in assessing the opposition, deployment of troops, supplies, strategies and tactics. Invariably it was decisions made in the field and the morale of those on the front line that won or lost actions. All we can do now is sit back view where the mistakes were made and debate why."
5,History gets personal.,"As the years pass, a documentary such as this will become ever more priceless, as fewer of the Greatest Generation will be around to remind us of how terrible war can be, and always has been. Never before have I seen as deeply into the heart and soul of war as I have in watching this series. Many may put ""The War"" down as lacking in historical completeness, but that's not the focus anyway. Others may say that it puts too much emphasis on racism, but I think that was to show how people were willing to sacrifice themselves for our nation, in spite of how they were treated by it. Without talking directly to one who has been there, you cannot get a clearer view of the human side of ""The War"" than this.If, however, your questions are more historical in nature, I highly recommend the global perspective on the trials and atrocities of WWII found in the BBC series, ""The World at War"".Both are excellent documentaries I suggest at least giving a try."
5,Informational,This DVD is excellent source for information. PBS and everyone put so much work into it. The footage is amazing and gives many different perspectives on WWII!
5,So far it's amazing,"I have found it to be brutally honest, both in reinforcing the good parts of our national mythology about The War and in reshaping it in something more durable and useful for the future. With vintage film and current interviews, The War spans the years since it happened and makes real what for a 30 year old is hard to imagine."
2,Ken Burns's War,I watched most of the series on TV before buying the DVD.I would have never bought the DVD had I known that it was going to include the commercials.As for the movie itself it was better on TV because with the time delay between episodes I did not notice that each episode started out similiarly and that there seemed to be only about 25% new material after substracting out the commercials and repeated material.
3,typical ken burns,"I attended the premier in Ct. It is a well done series but essentially, for WWll readers/docu viewers, it is a been there, done that. Moreover, it had the usual Ken Burns spin."
2,Ruined by the Music,"I really looked forward to this, but having seen a portion of it on PBS, I was appalled at the selection of music. A single violin, or that's what it sounds like,screeching away, is extremely inappropriate to what might've been a great work. I cannot understand how Ken Burns could have sunk this low, after turning in a masterpiece like his The Civil War. What could he have been thinking? Not only is the music dreadful, but it's distractingly loud and there's no way to turn it down without losing the narration as well. This is a terrific disappointment. Shame on you Ken."
1,Not Happy,"I purchased the DVD three weeks before Christmas as a gift. I never received the package. According to your tracker, there was no such address. I had it shipped to my office. We receive lots of mail everyday, which indicates that the address does in fact exist. Nobody contacted me that there was any problem with the delivery, it just went back to Amazon. Thanks for nothing!"
1,The War - A Film By Ken Burns and Lynn Novick,"Buyer beware. As the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The packaging was the first clue as the glued areas seemed incomplete or coming apart a little. But the real telltale was the disc markings or lack therof. Zero hub marking (barcode, etc) and a little bluring of the white on black fine print on the disc cover. In my opinion this was an obvious knockoff. I feel violated."
3,mediocre and full of holes,"Frankly after the first episode I was appalled at the amount of information being left out. Not little inconsequential battles either. Many events were glossed over--barely touched. After the first episode I did not want to watch any more, but I did and it did improve, but it is hardly spectacular or educational. I learned more from Herman Wouk than Ken Burns about world war II. I didn't expect it to be in the same class as the Civil War, I can understand wanting to be different, but I expected so much more and I was so very disappointed."
1,My first -- and last -- Ken Burns video.,"I'm writing a book about World War Two so I've bought a lot of videos and books for research. I had to stop watching this video after one hour. Referring (only) to this first hour of film, if I had wanted to look at a few black and white photographs, I would have gone to the kind of thrift shop that carries old photos and asked for five or ten of them.Also, the narration is annoying and inexplicable. Must all words be of one syllable and spoken so slowly? All I've learned so far (Spoiler Alert) is that there are some American cities wherein lived a handful of people a number of whom had one thing or another to do with WW2.I'm not sure I have enough time left in my life to work through four disks of this."
4,SLOW-MOVING BUT DETAILED HISTORY OF WWII,STILL VIEWING IT BUT A FINELY TOLD HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE WAR. KEN BURNS DOES A MASTERFUL JOB. WELL WORTH THE TIME
5,A must have for WWII/history buffs,"This is a great series from Ken Burns. He and his staff put much time an effort into collecting the stories of everyday Americans. These firsthand accounts are a part of the priceless history being lost everyday. I'm so glad they collected them. The video, photos, and audio are compelling. This is a no holds barred account of a challenging time in history that forged the U.S. and that generation. Buy this series it is well worthy the money and the time."
3,Not close to his Civil War documentary.,"What a strange take on the war.There is no music, at least so far as episode 3, that compares to the music from his Civil War film.There is so much emphasis on the ""home town"" people, that I felt like going down to the local soda shop rather than watching this movie.I guess I was expecting something as good as the Civil War.I am sure that everyone will rate this documentary very high and I will be one of the few that thinks it isn't that good.Sure wish they had used that year making the sound effects into making this a better film."
2,"""The American Perspective of WWII""","I wish I had read these reviews more carefully, as the information is here. If you're already familiar with the detailed history of WWII then this would make a nice addition to your perspective. But most of the narrative is either ""at home"" in America during the war, or endless interviews and letters of the people involved. Some of it is quite good, but much of it is boring. I know the general historical arc of the war already, and that's about all you get from this."
3,Cloyingly PC and anti-American,"Burns repeatedly goes out of his way to stress the injustice of the Japanese internments, racial segregation of Blacks, isolated U.S. war crimes and U.S. military tactical errors. At the beginning of each episode the Bank of America tells us that ""by learning about the past, we can do better in the future"".While America certainly was not and is not perfect, I think Burns was way too negative in his treatment of a heroic generation which sacrificed so much for us.Also, on a purely technical level, I don't think the composition worked very well. Possibly this was because Burns for some reason gave very little attention to the political and military leadership on both sides of the war.Overall, I was quite disappointed with this series."
5,"Ken Burns' ""The War""","The War - A Film By Ken Burns and Lynn NovickCan't say enough about the value of this product. Tasteful, informative, riveting insight into the times, the people, the perspective, the drama of the times."
5,Should be required viewing for some,"Yes, there's a lot of bodies. Others have mentioned that. It's war, and war isn't pretty. But overall the series is wonderful. For the amount of information covered, they covered it beautifully and the personal stories add so much. High school aged kids should have to watch this. It's no worse than a lot of the stuff they already view and this, unlike the shows on t.v., is REALITY. It makes you appreciate what the Greatest Generation went through so that we could have stuff like Real Housewives and the Jersey Shore, although I don't think they were fighting for that. They were fighting for something our kids today take for granted, precious freedom that isn't free."
4,Good look at WW2 America,"The War is a good look at WW2 America, focusing on 4 cities, both fronts and the stories of the vets and those on the homefront it never drags. Some stories are funny, some are sad i got sad when the ones they were telling about died. The combat part is interesting,the social part is told a little differently at times, its great how Japanese Americans from internment camps become great soldiers for America. The growth of Mobile is intresting how quickly it declines after the war is understandable. The combat part is enough to satisfy with out over doing it. The War is a fresh look at WW2."
4,The War,"I think this should be shown in all high schools in the U.S. The sacrifices that were made during WWII should never be forgotten. If people today were to pull together as we did in the early fourties, perhaps there would be fewer problems in our country today."
2,A grade school account of WWII,"After viewing the first 4 episodes, I'm very disappointed. There's no mention of the Hitler-Stalin Pact and that the Soviet Union invaded and occupied eastern Poland only weeks after Germany invaded western Poland. No mention of the Soviet invasion of Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in the late 30s. There's no mention of the other Axis countries such as Romania. The war was much more complicated than most Americans realize and this film will not help educate the viewers."
3,Factually Challenged,"I normally like products of this type, however after fact checking a number of assertions, I found myself severely disappointed. It is well worth watching, but be prepared to take some notes, or have your laptop handy for verification."
2,Ken Burns loses his way...,"Ken Burns is an extremely talented filmmaker. But with, The War, he has lost his way as an objective documentarian, exposing his political point of view in this most sensitive and important subject. I stopped watching this film within Disk 1 when he allowed an interviewee from Minnesota to state that the young men who joined the service did so for every other reason than patriotism. ""It had absolutely nothing to do with patriotism."" This is both blatantly false as well as an insult to the hundreds of thousands of WWII veterans. To allow this template to be placed upon the motivations of our American servicemen at the outset of the film was all I could take. I don't need to see any more of a film like this and will prefer to spend my WWII doc time watching unvarnished documentation of the war with the far more comprehensive, unbiased and educationally important serires, The World at War by the BBC."
3,Not the greatest,"I'm going to go against the tide on this one. The War does offer some new and novel perspectives, and its fairly well done. But throw in a few pictures of dead Americans, quote some statistics and ANY documentary would be rated as ""great and powerful."" To me, the most annoying thing about this DVD set is the repeated use of news footage of combat. Did Mr Burns think we wouldn't recognize it when we saw a repeat of a battle scene? And if one battle scene is shown for the report on 1942, and they show the same scene for 1945, you realize it cannot be authentic. This is cheap, lazy and dishonest to the viewers. Spoiled it for me."
5,Both DVD and book are fantastic,"This is great documentary on the 2nd world war,from a distinctively American perspective.the big difference between this and others is that it focuses much more on what was happening on the home front.the content,arrangement & naration are also great(typical of ken burns films)when I saw ""the world at war"" I thought no other ww2 documentary could come close,but this one does."
5,"I felt pride, admiration and sadness","I was thoroughly engrossed in these personal stories from a few US towns. It reinforced my enormous pride and respect for America and Americans, while reminding me that war is a horror, and brings out both the best and worst in people and governments."
5,"AWESOME, I CRIED SEVERAL TIMES","This is not just a great documentary on WWII, it is a sentimental journey through the hearts of America's finest generation. As challenging as that time in history was, watching and listening to this film makes me wish I were part of that generation. The world is too complicated and self absorbed now. Oh well, just watch it and you will be touched."
4,A great synthesis of history,"I read this book and Jared Diamond's Guns Germs and Steel back to back, and they're really similar books about the relation between civilization and the environment. But Civilizations looks at history from a historian's perspective, and therefore it brings specific insights from historical anecdotes, rather that something akin to Diamon's grand theory. I have a beautiful hardcover, and it's still nice to break it out once in a while and reread it."
2,Flooded with data,"This book is great if you are preparing for a history quiz. I'm glad I bought it, but only because I also have access to google. The writer touches on various events without discussing them in sufficient detail. The book is organized by geographical elements, which is novel. But it fails to dwell. The fleeting descriptions may be ok for someone who is a history student at Oxford and already knows enough, but not for me. Like I said, I ended up googling more content than what is presented in this book."
4,Jungle coming of age story,"I enjoyed reading this book. I had a better understanding of this novel than I did of another book version. The only problem I had with it was when Mowgli ordered the elephants to destroy the man village. Now that's a little mean spirited. And the ending is sort of confusing. Does Mowgli stay in the jungle or go to the man- village. All they say is wise speeches. Oh well, I still liked reading it."
3,the viewpoint. seeing by women's sight,"Some months ago, I read this book by korean edition. This book let me think about the unbalance between women and man. I recommend this book if you are man, you must read this. if you do so, you can understand women more deeply. this book was translated in 1996, seoul, korea."
1,Why reading this book is a waste of your time.,"I really did not enjoy this book. I understand that this is supposed to be a satirical look at American gender roles, but it was probably a lot more applicable back in 1970s. I am a feminist and this book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Maybe if you're a raging chauvinist, this book has something to teach you. To me, Brantenberg's prose seems trite. The writing is simplistic. The sex scenes are graphic, but moreover, so are the non-sex scenes. I felt as though the author was secretly smiling to herself and saying, ""I'm so clever"" while she wrote it. It's hard to define what makes for a great book, but here's something I can define: this book is not great. Or good. Or even tolerable."
3,FREDDY FENDER,THIS WAS AN OK CD BUT IT WASNT THE FREDDY FENDER THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. WE WILL TRY AGAIN..
5,Encore,"I saw Diane several years ago at ""Park in the Pines"" south of Seattle. She did ""Christ Means More to Me..."" which I have never heard sung more beautifully. With no physical or vocal theatrics, she just stood behind the pulpit and sang. The beauty of her voice and clarity of words overwhelmed the audience. The message and beauty of that song remains vivid in my memory to this day. Of all her music I have acquired through the years, ENCORE has become the one CD I value above all the others."
2,Seems OK but I did not trust the tool.,"I purchased this router on a whim and quickly returned it. It seemed good and might be, however the supporting documentation was horrible, the tool did not exist on Freud's (dissapointing) web site and no specs were available. They did supply a CD with the tool, but it didn't work and several requst to Freud for another went unanswered. Without this information I question Freud's commitment to the tool and worried about future parts and service. I ended up with a Porter Cable and more spec and user information than I would ever hope for. Bottom line was comfort .... I simply did not trust the tool or the company. Do yourself a favor .... stick with a quality brand that is willing to support their tools."
5,Router Table Use,The Freud FT1700 router is great for use in a router table. The ability to change bits without removing the router is a definite plus. Two options are available - either using the special adjusting tool above the table or actually looseing the router lock and raising it from below.
2,"Attractive features, but poorly built","I purchased this router a year ago for permanent installation into a router table. I was attracted by the height adjustment and spindle lock from above the table, and thought I could save money over an expensive router lift. However, from the start, I noticed a lot of backlash in the height adjustment. Also, the spindle would shift from side to side if the height adjustment direction was reversed. I decided to live with it. Then, the height adjustment socket in the base (made from plastic) stripped, forcing me to reach under the table to change the height. Recently, the spindle lock stopped working. Today, the motor died. I'll stick with Freud blades and bits, but avoid buying anything from them that plugs in."
3,Swayzak can stand the test of time,"Americans have been deluged with all manner of European electronic artists for a while now, and London's Swayzak lack the sort of stage presence orcelebrity connections that might make most of us notice them. But on Snowboarding in Argentina, Swayzak offers a passel of moody and sombertracks, such as ""Speedboat"" and ""Bueno,"" that recalls the best elements of Detroit's pioneering techno sound without falling prey to robotic minimalism. Swayzak do displaytheir limitations on digressions like ""French Dub"" or the failed jungle of""Cone."" But when they stick to their strengths, as they do on highlights like ""Burma Heights"" and ""Low-Rez Skyline,"" Swayzak can fill a room with whatever emotion they wish to express. And as long as understated successes like theirs continue to be made, electronic music will with stand the hype.-Justin Hampton"
4,Delivers as promised,"Tha' Hot Club iz what it sezz. One jammin' cd that may not jam as hard as some would like but comes thru as faithful, listenible and fully worthy of very loud quakin' in the street machine. Fully 8 out of 9 songs honestly rock. Go for it!"
1,Wanna be Wrapped,I was looking for something like Mike Phillips and the group Unwrapped. This is far from it if you know the group that I am talking about.They did absolutely nothing with the hip-hop hits on this cd. A total waste of time and money. They even messed up Barry White's hit. I can't say here what I really would like to say about this cd but it stinks some kind of bad. Try it for yourself and good luck.
4,A GREAT LITE ROCK ALBUM,"LIVIN' ON THE FAULT WAS RELEASED BY THE DOOBIE BROTHERS IN 1977 AND WAS ONE OF THE BEST LITE ROCK ALBUMS OF THAT YEAR. I'VE OWNED THIS OVER THE YEARS ON 8 TRACK,CASSETTE,AND NOW CD. THIS WAS THERE SECOND ALBUM WITH MICHAEL MCDONALD. I LOVE THE HIT SINGLES ""ECHOES OF LOVE"" AND ""LITTLE DARLING(I NEED YOU)"" AND ""YOU BELONG TO ME"" WHICH BECAME A BIG HIT FOR CARLY SIMON IN 1978. THE MUSIC IS KEYBOARD DRIVEN AND SMOOTH AND SOLID,WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SHORT COUNTRY ACOUSTIC INSTRUMENTAL SONG ""LARRY THE LOGGER TWO STEP"" WHICH SEEMS TO BE AN ALBUM FILLER SONG AT THE END OF THE CD."
1,"GREAT ALBUM, BUT YOU'RE BUYING THE WRONG VERSION!","The Japanese imports of the Doobie catalog are remastered.Warner Brothers here in the U.S. is still selling the old LP-EQ'd, terrible-sounding masters they released on CD in 1990.If you love these albums, get a set of the Japanese editions. They cost more, but they're worth it.Here is the link to the Japanese remaster ofLivin' on the Fault Line."
3,Faulty Effort,"Livin' On The Fault Line was the first Doobie Brothers album in which Michael McDonald took control of the band's sound. Their prior effort, Takin' It To The Streets, mixed the old rock sound of the band with Mr. McDonald's pop-soul leanings. This album is almost exclusively in the pop-soul vein. There are some excellent efforts, especially ""Echoes Of Love"". This is a hidden gem which ironically finds founding member Patrick Simmons embracing the new sound. ""You Belong To Me"" is another strong song Mr. McDonald wrote with Carly Simon (who would score a top ten hit with it). ""Chinatown"" and another Motown cover ""Little Darling (I Need)"" are good, but the rest of the album is a subpar effort from a group dealing with a new musical vision."
5,Soulful Gem,"A personal favorite of mine. Very tight, very smooth and very soulful. This album really brings out the best in McDonald's 'blue-eyed soul.' Great vocals and very tight production with beautiful guitar riffs, and subtle horns. You Belong To Me, You're Made That Way and Nothin' But A Heartache stand out and they're the type of songs that you need to listen to a few times to pick up the raw emotions, desperate lyrics and beautiful melodies. Top notch production and except for Larry the Logger Two Step, each song is solid. Some people may think this a bit too slick of an album, but it's always had a way of getting to me. An essential."
1,QUE QUE QUE!,Hold up iam not kid to start of.But what is freakin true is that these guys suckkkkkkkkkk. These guys are like those out of nowhere rappers.NOT Even rap.straight up stoopED!
4,Missing hits,"While this collection if a fine budget-line collection of Reba's hits, in reality it was probably issued to make up for all of the missing hits not found on the two-disc set ""#1's"". None of these tracks are duplicated on that set."
5,Not just for parents,"Jean Liedloff has done lots of thinking and experiencing that everyone should read about. Not only is this book helpful and needed in this world, it is very interesting. I have been recommending left and right to parents and non-parents alike."
5,Can be recommended for everybody,"This is one of my three favorite books, together with ""The Wild Girl"" by Michèle Roberts and ""Journey Of the Heart"" by John Welwood. It is about how to care for children in order to let them grow up in a happy way. And it's never too late!"
5,A Better Way to Raise a Baby and Beyond,A must for all prospective parents and grandparents who want the best for their offspring.
3,My mom used this on me,"I have never read this book but my mom did and used this concept on me when I was a baby. She said it was supposed to promote a secure inner feeling like everything is right with the world. Now, everyone is different and there are always many different circumstances contributing to everyone's raising, but she has said many times that she regrets using this. She said for the 1st 6 months of my life I wouldn't go to anyone but her, not even my dad. I'm now 28 & am still very attached to her, which I don't see as too much of a problem (LoL) but she sometimes says she feels like I'm smothering her. I don't feel like everything is right with the world, I mean, how could anyone really, and I'm not very independent. I don't know how much of this has to do with this concept but my mom thinks it has a lot to do with it. I really don't mind being so attached to her except that I don't think I could handle ever losing her."
3,Radical insights for all western humans.,"Heartbreaking deductions and radical insights. A well written and compact book, however Liedloff could have done ever better by leaving chapters 1, 2 and 5 out (unless you like socio-babble)."
1,an interesting look at childrearing attitudes of the 70s,"This book has some very nice ideas and supports a truly loving nurturing environment. I'm sure there are some parents who treat their children as the author describes as common in our society, but I have not witnessed it. Perhaps these attitudes were more prevalent when this book was written. I was born in 1965 and I was held almost all the time as a baby. While I appreciated the hold your baby message as well as other, I truly did not like all the conclusions that were drawn from the author's observations. In most cases she offered no supporting evidence other than her observations and I found myself thinking of numerous other causes/effects for the behaviors she described. I found her unscientific conclusions to be irresponsible and just plain silly at times. I have 2 young children and I did not feel inspired to change my childrearing methods at all by this book."
2,"Acceptable, but not the most interesting book I ever read.","Contradictory in the intended messages, and I would love to see a revision of this book. The homophobia is offensive. Yet, it's an interesting read about how we have lost sight the simple pleasures in life."
3,Sweeping assumptions,"It is a book with some great and some not so great ideas on raising a baby. It does make sweeping assumptions about human life in general. It feels like author is very inexperienced in raising children herself, so you won't find much of the practical advice.There are many great practical books out there about raising kids bonding style, so I would just cherck this one out from the library, if you are curious."
4,"Good, with a few outdated ideas....","If I could have given this book 3 1/2 stars I would have, because though I think it's above average, I found a few of her more outdated ideas a little hard to swallow (such as her theory about the causes of homosexuality). However, the overall thesis of the book is very compelling and thought-provoking. Though she relies heavily on her experience with only two tribes of hunter-gatherers, so one could argue that her conclusions can hardly be considered universal, it is still an interesting book, inviting readers to consider child-rearing practices in a cultural context."
1,Reality check: she hasn't got kids!,"Hello! This women hasn't got any kids! Don't take parenting advice from people who don't have kids! Seems elementary, but OMG -- when my kids were born back in the early '90s, I knew parents who were trying to do this. Their kids were like little bats attached to the mother's chest 24/7. One thing it might be useful to point out is that in cultures where this is still practiced, the men hold all the power. The women are basically farm animals, and their children are the product -- belonging to the farmer. If you want any power of your own, Girlfriends, you have to put down the kid now and again. Meantime, why are you taking parenting advice from a single woman? You think if you do what she says, you're going to have a nice life like her?"
1,The worst book for parents!,"I was excited to get this book. However, I hadn't read far when I realized this book had more about evolution than anything else. It had little about the indian tribes who were of more interest regarding parenting. I was offended as a Christian with the constant referal to evolution. This book insults we American parents quite a bit also. The main theme is how we should continually (24/7) hold our babies. That's impossible. We can hold our babies quite a bit of the time, but how about driving a car, bathing, etc... This puts an unnecessary burden on wonderful parents who are doing their best, not to mention a backache. Save yourself time and money and leave this book alone. I threw mine away! Let the Lord guide your steps."
4,Amazing,"A must for everyone, this book can change lives. A little drawn out out for me, but amazing, I wish I had read years ago. Thinking of buying a copy for all my adult children! Read it!!!"
3,"Important, but badly in need of updating","One aspect of this classic book that I haven't heard much about is the extreme homophobia it contains. Liedloff suggests the likelihood that homosexuality is a result of ill child-rearing and unhealthy relationships with opposite sex parents, as well as some other very stereotypical nonsense. This was ignorant to say in the seventies, but in the late 1990's, it is extremely insulting and disrespectful. An updated edition is needed, as well as a discussion about how very insightful ideas can be attached to very ignorant ones!"
3,Fan failed,Liked the sound and picture quality until the cooling fan failed after about a year. Now DVDs and some CDs freeze up after it gets too hot unless I keep a portable fan blowing on it during operation. Purchased it at Media Play which has since gone out of business. Having a []time finding a replacement fan. Also wish I would have invested a little more and purchased one with a multiple CD changer.
3,Aux audio is not capable of Dolbly Digital,"Not a bad system, but beware if you are looking to process Dolby 5.1 from a satellite system through this product. The Aux-in only passes analog Dolby Pro-Logic.Dolby Digital sounds great from DVD source, unfortunately the engineering folks decided for whatever reason not to include an input (or two) for 5.1 outboard sources."
2,Not my theology,"He has interesting points to consider but Chamber's theology often differs from mine. So, for me, I won't purchase another one of his books. You'll have to decide for yourself. It also was a little ""choppy""...I believe you could find a more cohesive book on the subject."
3,Playful music which cheers you up!,"Good points:The instrumental part is amazing,especially""Icek w Kolomej"". Bad points:The voices are awful."
3,rack clips,the did what it's suppose to do keep the rack on the roof.the clips work well for a recent model elantra.
5,Great Review,This part worked perfectly and was in excellent condition. Shipped fast and will definitely order more in the future!
2,Need more info,"Your website was unclear as to how many clips came in the box. For 30$ I expected. Usable set of 4 clips but instead I had to make a second order and spend twice as much as I expected to eventually mount my rack. Does Yakima think I only need one crossbar on my roof rack? Anywho, I was less than satisfied. DK"
4,Yakima Q Clips make for good Fit on Toyota Prius,The custom Q clips made for a really good fit on my 05 Toyota Prius.Only complaint is that these didn't come with the same feet as the Q124's that I have on the Rear. The feet on those are half cut so they fit in the rain gutter and are much easier to setup.
5,Get ready to ride!,"I received an old Yakima sytem previously used on a huge car. I drive a little BMW and really needed a carrier for my mountain bikes, kayaks, etc. I was excited to get the whole system but quickly discoved the clips which secure the system to the car were not going to work. After a bit of research I found these clips on Amazon and ordered them right away. The arrived quickly and are the same durable quality you would expect from Yakima. I was able to assemble the carrier system and mount it securely to the roof of my small BMW 323i. Without these clips the system would have been useless to me and still be sitting on the floor or my garage. In the future when I change cars all I'll need to do is change clips and the Yakima system will stay with me forever. Great product!"
1,$70 for 4 tiny metal clips?!,Give me a break -- WAAAAAAY too expensive... and never on sale anywhere...and hard to put together and get on your car without scratching it up.
1,"Clips are fine, until they're gone and your rack with it.","I had a Yakima rack for years and it was fine. Did what a rack should do. The high price maybe was worth it, maybe not but that's up to you. The problem with this expensive system was made clear to me one day when I came out to my car and the rack was gone. Yes, I bought the expensive locks and it was locked. How could it possibly have disappeared? Turns out these clips aren't really designed to stay on so seriously. Apparently you can just jam a screw driver under the clips and pry them out from the door recess. You're thinking, but won't that scratch up the car quite badly? Yes. Yes it does. Beware this system. It's not as secure as Yakima wants you to believe. I'm just glad there was no expensive bike on it when it left. Getting better mileage now and I don't have to worry about parking garages!"
3,Q18 clips,"I bought these for my 98 m3 4 door, they are working fine but I was disappointed with the price and fitment. There are two studs available for each of the roof rack mounts and these clips only use one of the studs. I bought my Yakima rack used, and it came off of a jetta with Q103 clips. The Q103 clips actually used both studs for each mount but the bend in the clip was slightly off and I want to have the correct fitment. It would have been nice if the Q18 clips used both available studs, and remember the package includes 2 clips, you will need 2 packages (4 clips) to fit your car."
5,GOOD STUFF,"Yakima makes good products and these prove that out. Easy to install, the painted finish is nicely applied, and they are well engineered."
1,is this a joke?,"having read many julia quinn books in the past, i was looking for one i hadn't had the pleasure of reading before, and came across brighter then the sun. wow, this was awful. so awful i never finished it i was THAT bored. [and i will finish anything, just because i can't bear to leave something incomplete.] i am really stunned that this was published or that julia herself considered it worthy of her name and talent. such a disappointment and waste of time. sigh:("
4,Always great dialogue,"Another good book by Julia Quinn. Not her best, but definitely a notch above what others are writing. If you like Julia Quinn, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Not her best, but ...","...Julia Quinn is such a wonderful author, even her not-so-great books are still better than most! In BTtS, we meet up again with Ellie, Victoria's little sister from Everything and the Moon, and watch her make her way through a marriage of convenience with Charles Wycombe, Earl of Billington. Both characters are fairly likeable in typical JQ style. The plot is just a little thin and the nearly constant stream of injurious incidents can get a little irritating. However, it is a light, fluffy read that may see you through a rainy afternoon. And if you are a JQ fan, you will probably want to add BTtS to your collection anyway, so who cares if it's not up to speed with the Bridgerton books and How to Marry a Marquis? It's still head and tails above much of the rest."
3,Not up to Julia Quinn's standard,"This book was not up to Julia Quinn's usual standard. The plot was thin and predictable, the heroine was annoying, and the conversation between the two leads flat. I'd recommend you read it only if you have absolutely nothing else to do."
2,Yawn,"I've read all of Quinn's books and I usually like them enough to give them a 4 to 5 rating, but this one is just plain boring.Although the idea seemed decent(the main characters marry before they really know each other), it was just poorly executed. Charles and Ellie get married within first 50 pages of the book and the rest 330 pages or so is just constant fighting. In the last couple of pages they do 'realize' that they actually love each other and they live happily ever after.I know that Quinn's trademark is humor, but it seemed that it was just overly done in this book. There is no real romance,no real character exploration, no real plot, no building up etc., just (cheap) laughs and some sex."
1,Disappointing and Annoying,"This is Regency romance at its worst. The characters are unappealing and unrealistic. Can you imagine a lady, especially a vicar's daughter,chattering to a stranger familiarly,cutting off his boot from his injured foot and letting him lean on her shoulder to limp back to his carriage?I was particularly upset by the scene in which the heroine walked in heavy rain by herself to the Earl's home. She turned me off by not only looking bedraggled and dishevelled, but by seeking out a bachelor in his home to discuss their marriage.She even changed into his married sister's clothes. No lady of good upbringing in polite society at that time would ever stoop herself or be brazen enough to compromise herself in this way. The whole story sounds unconvincing because there is no chemistry between the Earl and the lady.I got some very enjoyable books based on readers' reviews but I didn't get it right this time. Bad luck for me"
4,Like Quinn,"After reading all of her books some of them seem to blend together, and this book was one of them. If you like her as an author you would like the book. If you are looking for a new romance author to read she is good. Stories take place in the past, usually poor girl, or working girl, or girl who has a problem meets a man that can help, or loves her, or wants to take care of her. They are an easy read that are enjoyable."
4,Nice change from the ballroom,After reading a lot of historical romances lately it was nice to have one set in the country instead of London. Great characters and secondary characters.
2,A Monty-Python Argument....,"The two main characters, Ellie and Charles, argue and bicker with all the maturity and absurdity one would expect of 12-year olds. Occasional wit made some of the dialog fun, but overall, it was an eye-roll. The book was pathetically short on plot. And what little it had encompassed the cliche elements of ""someone"" trying to create accidents designed to kill the Earl. Charles is forced to marry Ellie, a complete stranger, to save his inheritance per his father's will. And, oh my, how coincidental that Ellie has a soon-to-be stepmother who is forcing her out of her father's home and into marriage with anyone who will have her. I do enjoy some of Julia Quinn's books, but this one was not at all credible and was a waste of time to read."
2,Clumsy,"I have enjoyed several other novels by Ms. Quinn but couldn't force myself to get past the first 200 pages of this one. I thought the beginning was interesting, but the vast majority of the book so far has involved the protagonists arguing with each other or falling down. A lot. Clumsy characters and clumsy writing."
3,Kind of lame,"This book had a pretty good story but it was kind of lame. They didn't really seem all that compatable. There should have been more time spent on building their relationship instead of showing how well the can make each other mad. The romance was not there and neither were the love scenes. I have like other books of her, but this was a let down."
4,Wonderful book!,"I think this book is great. I read it over and over. The romance between the characters is sweet and just left me sighing in the end. I liked this book better than Everything and the Sun. I think in general, this is a cute story. It's nothing intense or passionate like the other books I've read but it's still lighthearted and sweet."
3,if your idea of romance is constant fighting......,"then this is the book for you. I usually love Ms. Quinn's books. This one was well written and witty. The only problem is that through the many incredibly stupid ""mishaps"" that move the plot along, all the two main characters do is argue, bicker, argue and fight. I read to escape this sort of childish bickering. Also, these characters behaved completely wrong for the genre.The book had some very bright moments, but overall, it gave me a sunburn."
2,Not the Best I've Read,"I was looking forward to this book based upon the first book I read ""How to Marry a Marquis"" from Ms. Quinn. This book fell very flat in terms of plot - no intrigue, no chase, and no thrill. However, I am still willing to consider reading other books since I thought her dialogue was well written and clever."
5,You'll Laugh Yourself Right Out Of Your Chair!!,I just loved this book! It was so funny. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire book! I loved how light-hearted things were throughout most of the book. It was rather refreshing reading a romance that was more on the side of pure fun than stiff seriousness. Although for those who have not read this novel the characters do find themselves in a serious situation at the end.You've just got to read it! I'm having trouble now deciding weither BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN is now my favorite Julia Quinn novel or if it's still THE DUKE AND I.~*sigh*~ Desisions... desisions...Thanks again Julia! As always your books are wonderful!
4,Charming book,"Eleanor Lyndon is minding her own business when Charles Wycombe, the Earl of Bilington falls out of a tree very drunk. Both Charles and Ellie are trying to deal with there own problem when they realize by getting married will slove their them. They marry but they don't really know each other. But dark forces that could end it for them.""Brighter than the Sun"" is the first book that I read by Julia Quinn and I really liked it. Ms. Quinn gives her readers charming characters and romance. This was the first book by Ms. Quinn, but it will not be the last."
5,Really Great Read!,the book was wonderful and came in perfect condition! arrived within the designated time. I loved it.
4,very funny,"This book was very funny! It made want to turn the page and read on forever!! A very clever story that makes you feel as if you know the charactes personally. I think that it was very interesting, but not as great as Julia's To Catch an Heiress."
2,A real disappointment,"I have read all of the Bridgerton series, and a few others (such as To Marry a Marquis), and LOVED all of them. This one I found extremely disappointing. No chemistry - at least on her part - and as others have said, it is just not realistic in terms of behaviour in the period. I never would have pegged this as a Julia Quinn book. I guess I would recommend buying it based on the many reviews that are far more positive than mine (and about 3 or so others who felt the same way!)"
2,Money better spent elsewhere,"I have not found much use for this book. It provides a rapid-fire introduction to many VC++ topics, but not much more. Several important details are left out, there are quite a few errors througout the book, and the examples are of no real value. I have tried to use the book as a quick reference many times, but have given up entirely and gone quickly to Richter, Swanke, Prosise, or Solomon. I was able to use it recently to add some wieght to a linoleum patch I applied to the master bathroom floor - no kidding.Knowing what I do now, I wouldn't waste my money on this book. Instead, check out Prosise MFC 2nd Ed. (indispensible), MFC Internals (misc. authors), Jeff Richter's (superb) Win2k references, Swanke's VC++ MFC by Example, and Solomon's Inside W2K. Each text mentioned is a must-have, IMHO, with special mention of Swanke's MFC by Example, which has earned me a couple of ""cool, how did you do that""s from fellow developers.Hope this helps and good luck."
3,Visual C++ 6 Unleashed,"This book has lots of errors in PART IV, and author show you nothing, MSDN reference has all of them and useful, The examples are trivial. It is not for beginner or experienced reader. Professional MFC with Visual C++ 5(wrox)is much better than this one."
5,Best book I've read so far,"I was looking for some contextual reading to help bring the Bible to life. It feels like ""magic"" sometimes and the people in it seem like ""characters"" and not people who shared this same earth. Well, this book did that. This novel about Luke - whether fictional or partly true, is so moving, so real. I love his struggle. I love that his emotions as a physician back then are so close to my emotions as a physician today. He seems so human to me- and clearly blessed and called by God. I love his ""human -ness"" and God's ""Godness"". I love how he misunderstood God and had such conflicting feelings about life. I love God's understanding, patience and gentleness with him. I love how he crosses path with people (formerly know to me as ""characters"") in the Bible. I am not sure what type of impact it will have on someone who is not a physician, but as one, a very ""ordinary"" one , compared to Luke, It's the best book I've ever read."
2,Too Mystical,"I found this book too farfetched, some description too graphic, and too much emphasis on the mystical and too ""wordy"". If you enjoy detailed descriptions of the places and times of ancient Rome and Greece, this is the book for you."
3,Dear and Glorious Physician,"When it was written it was a best seller. It just seemed datednand slow in style. The subject (the life of Saint Luke) matter, of course, is never out of style.Dear and Glorious Physician by Taylor Caldwell"
4,"Spiritual, historical fiction","Taylor Caldwell has gone out of style, but her work is eternal. This book is obviously the product of years of research and a wonderful, easy-to-read writing style.The physician is one familiar to us all, yet his identity slowly unfolds in the most delightful ""biography"" ever! Rich in imagery, the author's work takes the reader way back in time, while keeping all the characters fresh and believable.Good addition to any Chris-Lit collection."
5,Great book,This is one ofbthe best books I have ever read. I read it at least once a year. The story of Saint Luke is a tale of love and compassion.
5,Dear and Glorious - Wonderful,"I can not remember ever reading a book this good - in every way. What a great writer! Her work is in such great detail and the descriptions of places, people and events is beyond anything I have ever read. No wonder it took her 25 years to complete it. The human and spiritual insights just grab your mind and drive you to re-read some parts. They are ""glorious"" in and of themselves. I wish I had read this book when it came out in 1959, but I was far too young to have appreciated it. At 67, I love it! Caldwell Taylor is the best! I found myself standing with Lucanus in every scene. The spiritual underpinning from the start through the middle to the climactic close was so powerful that it made you sense the spiritual power grow in yourself - overpowering story of St. Luke."
2,Disappointed,"That's how I felt when I finally finished this book. It was LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG. And easy to put down. And difficult to pick up again. I forced myself to finish the book and when I did, I was disappointed."
5,I can't believe how quickly this came.,I think that I ordered this on a Friday night and it was delivered on Tuesday.
5,An amazing story!,"I have loved Taylor Caldwell for 25 years, since I was in my teens. This book is hands down my favorite. She brings Luke and the historical events surrounding him to life with her stunning prose and descriptive text. I have read this book no less than 4 times and each time enjoy it more than the last. It renews my faith and brings me closer to God with every read through. I also recommend Great Lion of God, The Earth is the Lord's, and I Judas."
1,Is not like at Store,"I changed my EDT from D&G; light blue to Eternity because it smelled good and lasted long. However, this one from Amazon is not smell like from store and is not last when I used at Store.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P250SA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Wonderful cologne that gets the panties dropped!,"This is one of the best Men's cologne ever. I always get compliments when Im wearing this cologne. Definitely gets the ladies' attention. I would categorize this as an old school sophisticated scent. It's definitely not a cheesy cheap scent and not like that garbage Axe smell. It's pretty strong and long lasting as well, and for the price, it cannot be beat."
3,Weak perfume,Eternity is a rather weak perfume. It's barely perceptible after application and its effects wear out in a few hours. It is not suitable for a full day use - especially if you have long working hours and a high-stress work enviroment. I am going back to Chrome Azzaro
1,FAKE !!!,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON.COM. IT IS NOT ORIGINAL. DID A SAMPLE TEST WITH THE ONE FROM MACY'S AND ONE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE.
4,good article,to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations
5,Eternity By Calvin Klein - Great Value,This was a wonderful surprise for my husband for our anniversary. He was super impressed with how big a bottle it was and I thought the price was very reasonable. The transaction was easy and the product was flawless. Thank you!
3,Not as pictured in ad,I ordered 3 of these items to give as Christmas gifts and I was disappointed when I opened the box and learned that the products delivered were in plastic tubes rather than the glass bottles as pictured in the ad. I doubt if I would have ordered this as gifts if I had know how it was going to be packaged.
1,Quality,"I think Eternity no is original, no long mor that half hour that reason is cheap.No good.SorryEsteban Orellana"
3,NOT LONG LASTING!!!,"This perfume smells good, but its effect lasts only for 3-4 hours even after having 14 sprays all over the clothes.I recommend this to those guys who want to finish the bottle in 10-15 uses ;)"
2,The cologne itself is great; but not this particular unit.,"As the title states, this was a bad purchase. To clarify again, this review is NOT about the CK Eternity for Men cologne in general, but this purchase in particular.I tried the cologne at the store before I decided to buy it on Amazon. I liked it a lot, it has a fresh and invigorating aroma, and stayed for a long time after I tried it *at the store*. Indeed, I should say that CK Eternity for men is still among my top choices for a cologne.This particular purchase from Amazon, however, disappointed massively. Although the aroma is still fresh and invigorating, it doesn't even last more than an hour! I suspect that's because this particular item has been in Amazon's stock for several years."
3,Phoo phoo,"I was a gift for my son, he supposedly loves it! I know nothing about it, apparantely it is his favorite."
5,Great Product!!!,It's the really deal. I love Eternity for Men by Calvin Klein. They got the item to my door very fast.
5,Great!,Both my husband and I LOVE this perfume; truly amazing. Delivery was great and item is excellent. Will definitely purchase again and again from amazon. Great price too!!!
2,"Its just Ok, there are better choices","It smells ok, but no attraction factor. It does not last long, the smell is gone within an hour. For the price there are much better perfumes."
1,Fake Eternity for Men,This is not the original Eternity for Men. Doesn't smell like the real one. Please don't buy this product. It's a waste of your money.
1,prdoct and service bad. Seems like I got wrong cologne in original cover.,"I love this cologne when I bought from others. Dealing with Stores123 was not great, their price change several times a day. The smell vanishes away so quick. The smell stays whole day when I got it before from stores and others. When I cancelled the order they informed that it was already shipped. When I received the package found they shipped 2 days later their claimed date."
1,Smell vanished,"I love this perfume. I bought it from amazon as it was cheaper compared to any other place and thought it must be original. But when I receive it, it looks original but when you spray, smell vanishes in few minut"
5,great product.,I Have used this product for many years and I still love this. still have people want to know what sent this is. eternity is a great cologne.
5,"Oh, what the heck...someone has to review it!","ETERNITY is the only fragrance that I use, a practice that I have done for over seven years. It has a subtle, never overpowering scent, assuring me that I will make just the right ""impression"".What else does one want from a cologne?"
5,"The best men's fragrance, hands down","I have been using Calvin Klein's Eternity for Men since it appeared back in 1989. I had previously used Calvin and Obsession for Men from CK, but I found a certain distinctive appeal to the clean, fresh scent of Eternity that is never overpowering or intrusive. What I especially like about it is its staying power...many colognes or EDTs lose their ""charm"" later in the day after application. Of course, the aroma of Eternity weakens in strength on the body from its initial spray, but even its mellowed state is recognizable. Fragrance ""layering"" using Eternity's Body Moisturizer and Body Powder adds to the experience. There's something to be said about finding a fragrance that works with one's body chemistry, and I know that Eternity is the one for me. The ""greens, crisp jasmine, sage, and basil"" notes do make a difference, and that is why it continues to be a top CK seller even now in the highly competitive and crowded fragrance market."
3,Pretty Good smellin but...,"I bought this cologne merely after reading a few reviews on amazon... may be i should have tried it on personally before i bought it. The cologne actually smell nice. Its got a nice fresh smell to it. The only thing is since it was made in the 80's all the older people have used it and kind of smells old. If you are in your 20's i wouldn't recommend this, may be if in you late 30's.The smell remains for 4-6 hrs depends on various factor, fades away nice smelling too"
1,Counterfiet,"I love this perfume. I bought it from amazon as it was cheaper compared to any other place and thought it must be original. But when I receive it, it looks original but when you spray, smell vanishes in few minutes. I tried to reach the seller to take back, but they will not take it back. I love this perfume, but dont buy it from here. No wonder why it was cheap."
1,not original,"I bought this perfume and the smell does not stay even one hour, not original, and I bought in stores and not the same scent.do not buyed this seller, it's a scam!"
1,Fragnance does not stay longer than an hour...,Before this order.. Everyone recommended me NOT to order fragrances from Amazon ..But being a lazy and had trust on Amazon I have ordered this from Amazon and realized I really made a mistake .. because fragrance does not really stay longer than 1 hour...I used eternity before and that have log lasting fragrance and that I bought from Calvin Klein storeShipping was great .. I got this on next day only...but not happy with the quality of this..
4,A perfect workhorse scent.,"This stuff is a favorite standby of mine. Girls like it and it mixes well with your own body scent. It is a great cologne for a change of pace, because it has an old school style to it - yet still luxurious and mysterious. You can do a light spray for daily wear or a heavier spray for a date. Girls will recognize the scent, but never guess what it is because it mixes so well with your own body scent. It's a great game I always play with Eternity. It only gets 4 stars because the scent is not seductive. You smell great, but ladies aren't instantly turned on by the scent alone."
2,Horrible spray unit,"I ordered this coz I had this in the past and obviously like the perfume very much. But the damn doesn't work at all, it's gotten stuck and I dunno what to do now!!"
4,Eternity,Great winter cologne. I alternate it with Obsession. I always recommend using the same deodorant as the cologne you are wearing so nothing clashes. Usually the gift sets are the best way to purchase these products.
1,I've got cheap counterfit.,I use Eternity all the time and know its scent. Buy it in Macys or other trusted stores.
1,I might have got a fake one...,"I got this for the first time after trying it in a local store as the smell was great. Once I got this and after using this, I was disappointed because the smell does not long last after spraying, So I thought might be this is not that great, but after couple of months the bottle started to leak from the bottom, then I got the impression that I might have got a fake one, that is the reason might be the smell isn't lasting long. So, I would never buy Cologne here again."
1,does not last more than a minute,for some reason the perfume purchased from amazon does not smell or last the same way the same product purchased at the store does. I heard this once before an thought it was hogwash but I will tell you that the fragrance dissipates soon after you put it on.
4,great gift idea,"I originally bought this for myself and loved it so much I bought it for all of my employees. The great thing is no cords dangling down. The massager has two speeds which are perfect, plus the squishy feel of the pillow is light and comfortable around your neck. You will enjoy it!"
2,I'm not impressed at all.,"All it seems to do is vibrate. It's pretty, the material feels nice; it just doesn't do anything other than vibrate."
1,"If you have a big neck, forget it","Perhaps, I got a neck pillow that was a lemon and the rest are all wonderful - but this isn't about the batteries or the vibrating it's about the fact that the neck opening is not big enough to keep the pillow on my neck. I know my head sprouts directly out of my shoulders, but I can't imagine that it's supposed to be that small. Anyhow, if your neck is not of the slender swan-like variety, this pillow is not for you. It is nice and squishy, though."
3,It's Ok,"For the price, this is an ok product. The fabric and filling are comfortable enough. The massage vibrator works good for what it is.......a $15 pillow."
2,small,it is very small and it just have one little piece that vibrates in the back so it just rest on you neck and nothing else. i am sorry i purchased this item
3,Not sure what I expected.,"This has a purpose and does buzz the muscles, but the buzzing sensations in my ears is annoying to me. . Works great to wrap around an arm or thigh muscle strain. It's not a massaging action like the HoMedics massage mats are."
2,Disappointed,This is a product that I was hoping would help my neck pain. It is bulky and fairly worthless.
3,just clicked purchase,"I just kind of bought this Album on a wim. I listen to the samples on the Amason and though it was cathy. It has hints of bands like Knapsack, Hey Mercedies, and Jets to Brazil. It got some pretty up eat guitar riffs and some catchy beats."
3,This is some good Music,"A really good cd. Not as good as thier first ep, but still good stuff. If anyone is intrested they have another ep on deep elm titled The Reason I Failed History. Supplies are limited"
3,This book's got the same info as Mega Speed Reading!!,I got the Mega Speed Reading program from the infomercial and basically it's Howard Berg reading off his book word for word. Does it really work? Well I can't read like Howard does on TV but he does teach you certain techniques you can use. I would definitely get this book instead of the Mega Memory Program!!
5,Our 2-Year-Old LOVES this!,"Our daughter, who just turned two in August, absolutely loves Sesame Street. When we bought her this movie we hoped it would keep her as involved and interested as the TV show and it has far exceeded our hopes. She has watched it over and over since the beginning of October, (along with her 9 year-old sister and 10 year-old brother if you can believe that!) and she now not only sings some of the silly songs, but says some of the lines with the characters, too!It is very informative and yet it keeps her attention. Every time she sees the part about the apples and the cider mill, she asks for an apple to eat!I am now in the hunt for the perfect Sesame Street holiday show, (maybe Elmo's World Happy Holidays?), so that the Halloween shows can be hidden away until next year."
4,Excellent Sesame Street Special,This is a great Sesame St. show! My kids like the ones where there is an actual storyline as opposed to the show itself that goes from skit to skit. This one is very cute and they watch it year round.
2,Not What I Expected,"I wasn't impressed with this dvd at all. My daughter is an Elmo freak, but even she barely paid any attention to it."
5,Amazing Little Penlight,"The AAAA batteries are the only negative thing I have to say about this penlight. They're not easy to find. Regardless, the light is bright, constant, and very well built. I use it for checking pupils and such in nursing. It is the perfect size and really high quality. This little light cannot be beat."
3,Not for medical,"I purchased the item for use a a medical student, but found out that the lighting us not suitable for examination of live tissue. The item is not for medical use and is very useful as a shop/mechanic/ emergency flashlight. It has a very bright light and is very slim in design"
5,Excellent Light,"This light puts out a really bright beam for its size. It's just a little bit longer than I'd like, but nonetheless it still fits into a shirt pocket. I believe it is rated at 10 lumens, which is plenty bright for finding your way in the woods and you can be assured the batteries will last a long time. A click on-off button would be nice, but it's not difficult to turn on at all by twisting the end cap. The plastic hood that fits over the bulb end really helps to focus the beam instead of having it spread out wide. I found that it works well on the brim of a cap simply by taking the clip off and reversing it. All in all, this is an outstanding flashlight."
4,Handy Pen Light,"This item is handy for instant light - although not the brightest as compared to a regular hand-held flashlight. Good for close-up inspections such as documents, etc. or within small, confined spaces."
2,Connection Fails,I have owned three of these and all three have done the same thing. Afer a month or so the light works intermittently and you have to shake it or hit it with the palm of your hand to get it to work. It seems like there is a loose connection or something. If it didnt have this issue I would give the light a great review but since all of the ones I have had failed in the same way it falls short of being a solid tool in my opinion.
3,Good for HGN,"I have used this type of pen light for over five years. they are rugged and tough enough to take the abuse I give them. I dislike the plastic nose cone, which on this one I glued on. Its an optionl add on for the end user, but for my application of doing HGN its a solid move."
5,good product,"Fast shipping, great product as described, about that, the description is the best i've ever seen online; it's accurate and precise. I strongly recommend this pen light."
3,Nothing great,"Doesn't turn on when you need to turn the thing on. You have to fight it at times, twist the top just right, etc. Half the time after pushing the top for some light, it doesn't light. Once it does light, it works fine."
5,Hubby loves it,"This was a gift for my husband since his old one finally died & he was crushed. He loves this one as is very slim but has good light, so he keeps it in his backpack at all times just in case he needs it."
5,Bright and Durable,Item is exactly as described and has a strong and well crafted feel. The light is very bright and I use it to examine patient's eyes so it can be a little blinding but I just warn them ahead of time it will be bright.
2,Product Warning says to AVOID EYE EXPOSURE,"I purchased this to replace a medical penlight that had broken. Once I received it, the package had a warning on the back that said...Warning: Class 2 LED Radiation, Avoid Eye Exposure.That ruled out using it for the nose and eyes of my children, which is why I purchased the light in the first place. I had to ship it back and purchase a different light.I wish someone had mentioned that in the product description. It is a very bright light and would be useful for other things where eye injury would not result."
2,Not that great,"I bought this penlight and had to buy another brand since this one basically fails on most levels. First of all, it's really long, about two inches longer than a regular pen, so it doesn't really fit well in a coat pocket. Second, the pen doesn't work like a normal penlight, e,g, click the button it's on, click the button it's off. Instead the button has to be held in to keep the light on, or you can twist the end to keep it on. Not a very convenient set-up since it takes two hands to turn the light on and keep it on. And finally, as a diagnostic tool, the light is way too bright for most patient's eyes.On the upside, the light is really bright. That may come in useful someday. For now, I have a very nice $3.00 penlight I got elsewhere."
5,Handy,How can you not have a handy little light like this? It's extremely bright for such a small package. Very cost effective as LED's are energy efficient too.
5,AAAA,"firstly, i dont own this but the concept is amazing for the price.obviously, anything with a non-marking tip can be a stylus. anything that wont scratch or mark on the screens of pdas and such. however the LED feature is to die for. basically because i would never go and buy AAAA batteries from some highdollar store, nor order them online. the trick people is a 9V batterypack. simply take some pliers and pull the hard shell off of a 9V and you have 6 AAAA in your hand. they're unmarked, sadly so you need to do a voltage test OR just trace the polarity as they are in the package, it's pretty obvious with each cell connected end to end."
4,Like the Stylus Pro much better.,Maybe it's not fair to judge this compared to the stylus pro light by Streamlight but we like the pro much better. This penlight is just too long and I'm not as fond of it's bluish light it emmits compared to the overall light out put of the Pro. We find it easier to carry the pro in a pocket and find it fits our needs more. But thought we'd give this one a go. Wouldn't recommend unless you are looking at very similar pocket penlights say for medical field. And I actually like some of the plastic body models years ago that did not emmit that blue light but a warmer yellow....yes I know it's the type of bulb that makes a difference and these bulbs last a lot longer. I can't fault the quality of this light and it does like the other streamlights it has a stay on button which is one reason we like the Streamlights over most other brands.
4,Good light,Good for small places Great for showing crowded areas to others Computers small appliances Teaching other people how a machine works
4,Great pen light.,"I work in a hospital. I am a department where the light is always dimmed. This is a great penlight because it's not only light but its bright enough for my job. I would like to give it a five but I had issue with the length and It has a tint of blue. I order a white thinking that Its going to be bright white but the light has a blue tint. I thought the 6 1/4 in. length will fit OK with my uniform, unfortunately it did not plus if you add the glare guard that came with its going to be longer. It is not a big deal, it still fits in my pocket, it just sticks out a little. Over all I still recommend this product. It is a great pen light. Just be aware of the length and the pocket of your uniform."
3,Shiner,Not to bad thought it could be a little brighter but it is just a pen light. It doesn't matter much I already misplaced it.
4,Streamlight Stylus Penlight review,"I like everything about the light, except it's finish is too slick. I also have a number of these lights in the black color, and they are all too slick. They need a rougher surface on the light.If this was corrected, it would be pretty near perfect."
3,"Caution: ""Silver"" model doesn't look like the picture","The silver model is no longer a nice shiny finish.It is now halfway between shiny and that crummy metallic light gray plastic which is called ""silver"" when used on cell phones. It's still a metal tube, but it looks cheap.The pocket clip is a darker color now, I guess so they can use the same color clip for all models.It's no less functional, but if all you want is function, and not appearance, there are more practical flashlights available which take AAA batteries instead of the slim AAAA batteries."
3,Pen light,This pen light is actually longer than a pen. The light is quite strong but the whiteness makes it rather harsh with reflective glare. Probably better for making repairs than viewing art work. I prefer a light that one can click on with one hand. Here you need two hands to twist the top in order to keep the light on. The light can be turned on for a brief period by just pushing the top.
2,misleading,"it is a good flashlight but that's all it is... i bought this thinking i was buying a stylus with a flashlight but it is just a stupid flashlight pen with just the design of a stylus... none the less, disappointed."
5,Great Purchase!!!,"I work as a Paramedic and wanted a dependable Penlight I could use when assessing patients* and for miscellaneous things that might come up during calls. So far It has been a great and useful tool when out on a dark scene and you don't have a flashlight available. It's small, and fits into the Pen pocket on my shoulder sleeve so its easily accessible at all times. I would highly recommend this for anyone working out in the field or even for everyday use around the car or to put in a glove box should you ever need it.*Be careful when using this Penlight to assess a patient's pupils. It is much brighter than the usual generic Penlights that might be provided by your department so use with caution. Personally I don't shine it directly in their eyes, I find that bringing it up on the sides gets the job done very well because it's a very bright light."
4,nice light,"Very bright, long 6 inches which makes it easier to hold/use and more comfortable. i wish it had a switch that kept it on without holding down the button."
3,Penlight is OK,"I like the penlight but I don't love it. It functions okay. I guess the primary problem I have with it is that it is a bit too long to fit comfortably in your shirt pocket. It needs to be about 1.5"" shorter in my opinion. Other than that, I think it is fine."
5,Too BRIGHT for my needs,"I intended on buying this for use in the medical field (eye examination, etc) but this light is just too bright! The sleeve that focuses the beam is a nice add-on and produces a nice tight intense spot-light. Without the sleeve the light easily illuminates a dark room. Love this light but will need to get a cheap LED for my patients :)"
1,I don't trust Streamlight anymore.,I've owned eight Streamlight flashlights and only one still functions. My original Scorpion is still going strong after years of use as a Peace Officer working in the Criminal Warrants Division of a large law enforcement agency. I owned three Stylus flashlights and all of them quit or became glitchy. Five of the eight Streamlights used LED's and the electronic guts in them just didn't last. I wouldn't depend on one in a survival situation.
4,Great Little light,"I'm a computer tech - lots of time spent crawling around under desks, in closets, trying to find tiny serial numbers stuck on faded stickers in odd places in the dark. I had previously owned the much more expensive Fenix pen light. This one compares very favorably. While not as bright, it's certainly bright enough for most purposes, including the occasional sojourn through the empty warehouse; it's also less than half the price of the Fenix, so when (not if) I lose it, I won't be out quite as much as with the Fenix. The momentary switch plus the constant on is also a simple but very useful feature. Feels solid, and hasn't let me down yet."
5,holy sh*t you have to read the ultimates!,This volume of the Ultimates is truly amazing. Thc character development is phenomenal and the story arc is just as spectacular. I highly recommend buying this and all the past Ultimate graphic novels. Also picking up the next volume is a must because the current story arc blows this graphic novel out of the water. This is by far the best comic series out today!! It is far superior than other great books like Y: The Last Man and Invincable. Buy it now!!!!
4,Ultimates 2 With Ultimate Consequences,"This one is set one year after the original storyline ends with The Ultimates now under public scrutiny after it is mysteriously leaked to the media that Dr. Bruce Banner is The Hulk and that The Ultimates were behind the cover-up! Now, the public is calling for Banner's execution!Captain America and The Wasp have been in affair while Giant-Man has been outed from The Ultimates due to the domestic problems between him and The Wasp and the P.R. mess it made. Still, The Wasp still shows some mercy towards her former husband though she hasn't shown any interest in hooking back up with him. This hasn't made old-school gentleman Cap happy at all.Getting back to the leak on the Hulk, it may be coming from none other than Thor himself, who was already not very well trusted to begin with! Plus, we discover some new revelations about this Thunder God!All in all, a good follow up to the original Ultimate storyline!"
3,"A lot of detail, little dialogue, kind of boring","The attention to detail in this story is incredible; however, the short story of ""The Prussian Officer"" was rather just BLAH."
4,Good Collection of Stories,"The collection of short stories I read in ""The Prussian Officer and Other Stories"" were a good selection of what life was like in Nottingham, where the author was born. D.H. Lawrence's pieces like ""Odour of the Chrysanthemums"" and ""The Daughters of the Vicar"" reflect on his childhood and the city he lived in. The reader has that feeling that reminds them of their town and the people that lived there. The people in his stories have some influence on what their lives were like.I read some of the pieces in class and actually found myself immersed into them. The use of dialogue, details of the countryside, and the tensions between class, gender, and sexuality. Reading these pieces I grew to appreciate literature and its structure."
5,Our cat loves them,"Don't know how they work as a bungee cord, but our cat just loves to play with them. We have to pick them up at night or she will wake us up playing with them. Best cat toy ever."
3,Little too hard,I guess it depends what you use these for. The the cord is very hard and not very flexible. For the tarp or canopy i guess its ok.
5,Tarp bungee ties,Purchased 3 sets of 25 to tie down tarp shelter cover.These had heavier cords and larger balls than original shelter bungee balls.A very good buy.
2,Its a waste of money!,"To tell you the truth, I did'nt enjoy reading this book. If you really want to learn more about 1911's, go to the nearest gunsmith."
5,excellent- absolutely recommended,"i cannot reccomend this book enough, i have been shooting for almost 16 years, been a police officer for almost 5, consider myself pretty knowledgble about firearms. this book answered questions i didnt even know i had, or ideas as to why/why not on the 1911. dave lauck is also an excellent craftsman, a real gentleman with whom to deal, takes great pride in his work, and if you have ever read any reviews on any of his work in the gun mags, all come back 'superior'. also to his credit, there is not a sentence of pitching his work, it speaks for itself and his reputation is known among operators as an excellent craftsman"
2,Tells you junk you already know.,"This book isn't worth it. It tells you lots of nonsense about how to customize your 1911, but not much how to deploy it in a ""tactical"" sense. Lauck pushes expensive customization of Colt 1911's but doesn't even touch the newer (and much better) clones. (Kimber, Springfield, etc.)."
3,Not quite pleased,"The book mainly centered on customizing the 1911, very little on tactical application and hardly anything on maintenance. Not quite pleased with it."
4,Good Book For Understanding The 1911 ACP,"I haven't had time to read the book but, since I know several associates that have one, I can only assume it a good one. Price is right."
1,Not so good - buy Korky brand,I installed a Fluidmaster Pro to replace a leaking toilet control. The instructions were not very good and the illustrations were poor. I have repaired toilet valves a number of times so the instruction quality was not very important for me. I am very handy at fixing things around the house and I enjoy repairing things not just for me but for the neighbors as well.The Fluidmaster would not stop running. It would turn on every 10 to 20 minutes and run for a few seconds. It was in our bedroom so I would hear it wasting water. I purged it several times per their instructions and it just kept running. I purged it and adjusted it again and again and nothing change. It kept turning on for no reason every now and then. I finally got mad and bought a new one but made by Korky. The Korky one installed more easily with better instructions better quality and worked fine right away.So my final advice is to buy Korky and avoid Fluidmaster. The Fluidmaster valve is just too finicky.
3,Beware Gerber toilet owners,"I have an older (mid-1990s) Gerber toilet tank. The Fluidmaster repair kit would work fine EXCEPT that the red tank-to-toilet gasket supplied with this kit is too small. I installed and uninstalled the kit 3 times, hoping that I could get it to seal properly, but it gushed water from beneath the tank each time. Now I need to find OEM-style replacement gasket from plumber's supply store. So it's not truly a ""universal"" kit."
3,Revised Buyer Beware,"Bought from Home Depot. The only type they had in stock. Installed easy. Lasted approx two weeks, and then the float began sticking. Attempted to reinstall thinking that was the problem. The Fluidmaster was installed correctly. Waste of time and money. Am going to find the original ball style and remove the fluidmaster and throw it in the trash.Update: Ordered the ball type. Before installing it, I again attempted reinstall with this device.... Honestly couldn't tell you want I did differently, however now it seems not to stick and fail to fill the tank. It has been working like a champ since I noodled with it for the 10th time.So far so good. Just put the ball type on the shelf as insurance. Maybe it just needed to feel competition..."
1,"I've tried several times to fix it, I give up",Bought it at Home depot. Instructions could be better but I got away with it. The design seems odd the way the leak control lever connects to the float and good luck if you have to go back into the tank to re-attach or fix any of it. After a couple of months the leak control and float stopped working - I fiddled with it and it seemed to work for a short while. Now the flapper seems to leak (a lot) and since the leak control lever broke (see previous comments) the toilet refills frequently.Bottom line is that this should be very straightforward and reliable - it is neither!
1,"cheap materials, shoddy design durability","The kit was easy enough to install, though I cringed when comparing these lightweight plastic components to my worn-out but heavy duty American Standard parts. After a few months, the fill valve water level sensor started sticking -- so the tank wouldn't refill -- I had to open the tank and tap so it would drop to the water level. Then the flapper started getting stuck in the open position. Tonight, the whole damn valve failed, and my bathroom had an inch of water in the few minutes it took to turn the water shutoff."
4,it's ok...gasket not universal,"I also had a leaky fix.Turns out the gasket in this kit will not work on a Gerber toilet...therefore, i had to buy the gasket seperately. After all this, it does seem to work well. cheaper than buying a new toilet."
1,"not ""universal"" and crappy flapper!","My toilet was dripping into the bowl causing it to drain and refill. A new flapper didn't solve that problem, apparently it was the inside gasket.First problem was the gasket to tank to bowl. I have an old Gerber toilet and the gasket included is nowhere near the fit it needed, and the directions don't even allude to that possibility. I went to three hardwares before I found the right one.Now it flushed without gushing from tank to bowl, but constantly ran into the bowl, causing the water to continually turn on and off. I took off the weak, poor fitting red flapper, and replaced it with the black ""bullet"" style one I took off. Problem solved. I wish I had seen these reviews first. Others have complained about the flapper not working.Fluidmaster seems to have the toilet repair market cornered. It would nice if they would address the differences in toilets. Nicer if their parts worked."
4,"A wonderful book, but where are the tapes?","I like this book very much. Hausa is definitely an underappreciated and underrepresented language. A great deal of Hausa scholarship is evident in the book and a real feeling for the people and the culture. The section on pronunciation is particularly valuable. Grammar and syntax are dealt with very clearly and very thoroughly. My one criticism of this book is that it needs audio support (read: tapes and/or CD). Although the explanation of the sounds of the tonal and intonational contours of Hausa is good, there really is no substitute for hearing it. The UCLA Hausa page will help a lot with learning to make the individual sounds (if you have sound files, of course) but there's no substitute for hearing spoken dialogues. I hope that there will be a new edition of this book which includes audiotapes."
1,"Good Setup, bad Followthrough","When I first saw this book, I thought what a great title. I couldn't wait to get the book and sit down to devour it. When I got it and looked at all the subtitles - I thought I was in for a hilarious read. I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there are a few laughs. Often, however the author goes a bit too far and the satire comes off as being mean and cruel, not at all funny. I thought he had a great outline for the book, but didn't know what to do then. I'd like to see someone who's actually comical try and write it."
2,Not for non-americans,"The book and its layout are nice and some jokes are funny, but most of the time I was asking myself what they were talking about. If you're not from the States or you don't know much about American 'culture', you might want to read another book."
5,Simply and Truly Delicious!!!,"This is one of those books that make you laugh outloud in the bookstore, on the drive home (careful!), in the tub with a glass of wine and at a dinner party with ten of the best and brightest in your group. Kudos to the duo who wrote it. Can't wait for the sequel!"
4,Medium-Funny,"Honestly, this book is a solid ""B"": definitely not an ""A"" and definitely not a ""C"" or lower. What is more amazing, however, is that Cathy Crimmins must have written it during her husband's recovery from a traumatic brain injury (See Crimmins's excellent ""Where is the Mango Princess?"" for an account of that). How should could have written this light-hearted fluff while going through that Hell is beyond me."
1,"Not a bad title, at least.","But that's the only thing charming about this little clunker. If this is what passes for Gay wit these days, then Oscar Wilde, Ronald Firbank, Cole Porter, Talullah Bankhead and even Paul Linde have died in vain."
3,No second hand,"I wish that I had noticed that this watch does not have a second hand before I purchased it. I could have bought a similar watch with a second hand for only a few dollars more, and it would have been worth it to me. The digital portion keeps good time, but the analog was off by an hour and five minutes. After I reset it, it went right back to being off by an hour and five minutes. I wanted an analog watch with a second hand that keeps good time, and I didn't get it with this purchase."
1,Do no keep speakers in place.,"I bought these to mount the satellite speakers for my Sony Home Theater System. They are not good. The screws that hold the speakers at the correct angle cannot be tightened enough to keep the speakers in the right place. With a minor bump, they droop. Spend the extra dollars and buy a more robust product."
4,Very Good Mounts for the Price,"Overall, these mounts are quite good. They mount very easily and tightly to the wall and can be snugged down just right, holding the speakers in place. They obviously aren't going to be as 'firm' as metal mounts or as attractive, but for the price I'm not sure you could find much better.A couple of things that keep them from being 5 stars in my opinion:- Depending on how they are angled, it can be difficult to access the hex to tighten them down. It looks like the hex could easily be stripped. I didn't do this, but be careful so you don't.- If you move your speakers a lot, the plastic could wear down as the hex screws are pinched on the plastic. Any movement could slowly wear away the material; however if you plan to position them and not move them, this is a non-issue.I would definitely recommend these if you are looking for nice mounts that don't cost as much as your speakers. For most people's common speaker use, these be just perfect."
3,"Good essays, but book is poor value","These three essays are crisp, clear statements of Wallace Stegner's beliefs about the influence of the American West on American consciousness.Please note, however, that these three essays appear with 13 others in Stegner's book _Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs_. With a total of 16 essays, that book is a much better value than _American West as Living Space_."
5,DeLonghi Dragon Heater,"This is a very quality product made in Italy. It is better than 2 other heaters I have. It is quiet and very safe, and it heats a room of 14'x14' very efficiently. But do not expect to heat whole house, you will need several of them. As a supplementary or temporary heater I would recommend this brand."
2,Customer Review,"I have just bought another heater this afternoon because this heater, Dragon DeLonghi is not giving me what I needed. I rate this 2 stars"
2,Not happy,"when I got this it did not work and it was smash on one side, I took the loss on it, because I did not pay much for it. It was not worse the effort to send it back."
4,Keep the Heat,"I bought two of these babies to survive the hearty winters of San Benito County (CA). OK, so the winters are pretty mild here most of the time. But it still gets down to near freezing in the dead of winter.I've used this type of heater for probably 10 years. The Delonghi units have easy to use timers that can be set to turn on and off multiple times in a 24 hour period. Great for keeping the room warm to watch TV and cool to get a good night's sleep.My only problem was with the wheels on one unit that kept falling off. Turns out the screws hadn't been inserted. Fixed that and then no more problems. The units do use a bit of electricity so recommend careful us of the timer mechanism to save money."
1,Junk,"Don't buy recondition stuff from Amazon because they don't know what their selling. When I open the box I was shock to see how anybody will try to sell this, it had no wheels, stand or manual. I didn't bother pluging in the heater. It was dirty and smells like it been kept in a basement for years. What a disappointment from Amazon for them to offer this item."
4,God's Armorbearer,"Amazing book!! It completely changed the way I see ministry. God has given the pastor the vision, and as God's servants, we help uphold that vision. Ultimately, holding up God's. Great book! Both challenging AND encouraging :)"
5,A Closest with God,"There are chapters with information that help you understand how you can have a closeness with God. This book should be read from the beginning to the end and mark references as you read. This is a book that will keep you searching.It answers questions that like how can I please God; how can I love my enemies. After reading this book, I advise everyone should read it, especially if they want a closer walk with God."
5,everything you need to khow,"as a servant of god , this book give you a complete illustration of what it means to be a true servant of the most high GOD"
5,We are all called to be Armor Bearers,"All of the reviews are correct. This is an awesome book, as is Armor Bearers II. Our entire church participated in bible studies on these two books. All Christians are called to be Armor Bearers, not just the leaders. Our leaders need our support. We need to be a help, not a drain. Read the building of the wall in Nehemiah. We are all called to build our part of the wall with a sword in one hand and a tool in the other. And while we build, we need to stand firm with our leaders."
4,Russian ballerina stars in this Swan Lake,"Fans of ""Nina Ballerina"" (Nina Ananiashvili) will treasure this book, because the Swan Lake story is illustrated with beautiful photos of the Russian ballerina. You can see how she uses her whole body to change from the loving Odette (in white) to the cruel Odile (in black). One reservation: I wouldn't use this book to introduce children to the ballet. The bold theatrical makeup, designed to be visible from the audience, is almost overwhelming in the closeup photos. For a child, Rachel Isadora's illustrations are a better introduction to the story. Still, Ellison's book is a ""must-buy"" for balletomanes and Nina fans."
5,Awesome book!,"Pictures are engaging and the text tells a great story. This book is regularly requested by both my car-obsessed 5 yr old (who rec'd this at 4) and my nearly 3 yr old. Highly recommend. The TV program ""Turbo Dogs"" is based on this book."
4,Will become one of your favorites,I found myself a little tongue tied the first few times we read this but it is a great story and well illustrated. A favorite for any child who loves dogs or cars. (And grown ups too!) Another book we don't tire of reading.
5,Great preschool book,My four year old son's favorite book. There are lots of words and many detailed pictures and phrases to keep your little one interested. I love the way it comes to a soothing ending as all the dogs go to sleep at the end...perfect for a bedtime story. You won't be dissapointed with this purchase!
1,The worst book I've ever buy,"I don't understand how an editor could publish this book. It's only attribute is a cool look, but it's content is null.Reading this book is like reading a lot of magazine headers, in wich you read what can dreamweaver do, but not how to do it.If you plan to buy this book, don't do it, it's a very bad choice."
5,Great fit...,my favorite pullover. It is very soft and feels great and I really enjoy wearing this without needing a jacket.
4,Gundam movie,"This DVD is the beginning of a wonderful and amazing series that started something truly awe inspiring.Amuro Ray a fifteen year old boy, pilots a mobile suit to combat the all powerful Zeon forces.Originally released in 1979, Gundam has been a favorite for nearly 22 years. The story in this series is on par with a lot of American stories, but done a lot better"
3,Buy ONLY if you are an AVID fan of this series!!!,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the movies (which are the 49 episodes of this series compacted into 3 movies). But, an English dub (which is always asking for trouble) to a 20 year old series? This is a great deal if you really like the series, but if you are a newer fan to Anime or Gundam, this isnt for you. The animation is old, I mean old. The story is what keeps you interested. I would suggest you see an episode or 2 if you dont know what this is."
2,"An Epic, but Intolerable","I am not thrashing Mobile Suit Gundam. I've been around it since I was a little kid, and am a big Gundam fan. However, the dub for this was TERRIBLE!!! For those of you hard-core anime fans who want the original series, I suggest one of two things: Buy this and associated DVDs and watch it in Japanese ONLY (w/ subs) or... Save your money and watch the bloody thing on Cartoon Network. If you still aren't satisfied, just pick up the movie trilogy. The dub is much more prepared in the movie version and the voice acting is more realistic, not the tweaked out voices you hear on TV. The English version of Mobile Suit Gundam was completely rushed. I'm giving it an extra star because all of the footage that is not in the movies is incredible. The scene in which Garma is ""assasinated"" doesn't come until the second or third DVD, but is very, very, very much more fulfilling. And I can't wait to see the Odessa campaign and the Battle of A Bau A Qou."
5,More Than Just Mecha,"Here we have it, Tomino's classic ""Mobile Suit: Gundam."" The first disk sets a lot of groundwork, but you can't really say that it sets all the groundwork. Throughout the series, characters come, go, and change; there's a lot more to the story than giant robots. The beginning of the series is also great for drawing those stark lines that seem so clear but blur so quickly once the story progresses.You'll probably watch this for the mech battles, which are really fun, but you'll most likely watch it again for the characters and the story.Seig Zeon!"
3,"Mobile Suit Gundam - The Battle Begins (Vol .1, Uncut Edn)","What can I say?! Well as a person who enjoyed Gundam in Japan when it first came out I can say that I'm happy to see it out now in English.... However, the english script leaves a lot to be desired.... it seemed to fall flat and was not really felt by the voice actors..... still great to see it out.... if you want top quality dubbing and moving voice actors definately get GUNDAM 08 MS-TEAM (That ROCKS).... maybe the directors of the ENGLISH dubbing for the 08 MS-TEAM series can redo the originals to the same quality. Pity the DVDs don't have the original japanese voices. But then Gundam is generally great stuff anyway."
3,No Japanese!!!!,The series is great and it brought back a lot of fond memories for me. The first is the best. Its just too bad that it only features really horrible English dubbing and NO ORIGINAL JAPANESE vo. Buyers beware.
3,Could of been better,"I think its great that they are now releasing the original Gundam series on DVD for the North American public, but this will only have the usually bad english dub on it. I would only suggest this if you do enjoy Gundam, and you don't mind not having the original Japanese translation and voice acting."
3,What who!! is bottom this Mask,"What Char!!!! why you remeber Char in Mobile Suit Gundam (1980-1981) if you know you will see the old Char the Same in Counter Attack and Mboile Suit (1981)but his Red Zaku, WHAT!!!! it that the Red Zaku Soilder a Cameo or the Same Character Find out soon in S.D:Gundam Force, if you see him will see his voice look the same as two.March-April 2004"
5,an unsual samurai movie,"It is not the kind of the movie I would recommend to anyone who loves the samurai film genre. The ones who prefers the sterile romanticism of the type of the Tom Cruise movie possibly will hate it.This ones offers a bitter insight to the harsh realities of the Tokugawa era. It chiefly tells about sin and crime, and about human weaknesses. Death is not heroic, but cruel, gory and painful.But the story is very interesting and the swordplay is outstandingly remarkable. A masterpiece of the less known but very talented director Hideo Gosha."
3,THIS LITTLE HOUSE . . .,"I'm giving the movie ''three-point-five stars'' because it's a good movie for writers to watch and learn from. I thought the script held promise except for parts in the middle and end -- where it sagged -- and where my suspension of disbelief dimmed.The acting was fairly decent but I thought the personna of the interegating police officer seemed off kilter in relatonship to the entire mix of characters, which included John Savage (""The Onion Fields"").I like movies where you are absolutely confounded as to who is the culprit or culprits -- and given the foundation that anyone or anything could be evil. In my book ""The Game"" is a pretty darn good movie becaus it kept me guessing, kept me off balance and involved.But ""Christina's House"" is definitely in my movie collection."
2,Not the best thriller,"A not so original scrips with less than talented actors. BUT, not bad when you compare it to other lower budget films."
1,My Thoughts on Christina's House ...,"I saw this movie ...and read the back and it looked interesting..The cast did a good job with it all, but some parts of the plot and storyline were not fully brought out like the way the father and the boyfriend acting. It leads you on in many ways to think that its either Christina's ... boyfriend or her overprotective father making the noises in the house taking her belongings, but i have to give it credit for not making it obvious who the psyco killer is in the beginning like some movies..overall it is worth renting but I dont recommend buying it."
1,"dear sweet god, who let these people near a camera","This movie is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is wretched, the storyline is predictable, there are some things that happen that are so completely random that you have no idea where they came from, and I don't mean that in a good way. It feels like they started to go with something and then changed their minds and failed to keep up with the consistency. This movie is laughably bad. I am begging you to not waste your money. Also, if you choose to waste your money, don't let this movie color your opinion of other ""teen"" movies, as some of them are quite good. This one is just exceptionally awful."
1,Holy mother of god,Back in 2001 my girl at the time rented this cuz I like horror movies....I dumped her soon afterwards. Stay away. Just stay away from this.
1,HORRRIBLE!,"There should be a law against previews that make a movie look worth seeing than the movie ends up being terrible. A so called suspense thriller about a girl who thinks her house is haunted. Predictable, boring, badly acted, and horrible written Christina's house could go down as one of the worst movies ever.Brenden Fehr of Roswell fame is the only saving grace and yet he can't even overcome the lame plot and writing. Brad Rowe ( so good in Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss) is miscast and a complete bore as the house handy man...and Allison Lange tries so hard to be Julia Stiles( looks alot like her as well) that she comes across as a bad wannabe. Other performances are so bad there not even worth mentioning. I urge you to stay away form this film no matter how good the trailer looks. It fooled me."
4,Dad Needs More Fiber...,"Christina Tarling (über-hottie Allison Lange) keeps hearing odd sounds from the attic above her room. Her terminally constipated dad (John Savage) tells her that the house is simply making ""settling"" noises. Meanwhile, someone is murdering young gals in the neighborhood, and dumping the remains on Christina's property! Could the killer be grumpy ol' dad? The crazy, hormonally explosive boyfriend, Eddy (Brendan Fehr)? Howie, the ultra-nice handyman (Brad Rowe)? Or is it the pushy, downright creepy sheriff (Jerry Wasserman)? Christina grows increasingly terrified by the prospect that she may be going insane like her mum (Chilton Crane). This all culminates in a wham-bang, violent finalé w/ an interesting little twist. As an added bonus, Christina takes a relaxing bubble bath! CHRISTINA'S HOUSE is a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to die there..."
4,Horror wins again,The movie really got a jump out of me. That has not happened in a long time. Seeing Allison Lange topless didn't hurt the movie either.
1,Christinas` House is TERIBLE!,I hate this movie. I hate it because Of The fact they have A puppy being Murdered. Im disguseted that they would put stuff on like that. I liked how it started . But Then I noticed How could anybody miss a puppy poor puppy being murdered I hate it!
5,Rowdy Mozart!!,"It is delightful. And ROWDY. We just love it."" Rusty, writer/actress and Bill, newspaper editor, Fort Myers, Florida."
5,No Need to Twist My Arm,"Teaching students, let alone middle school students, to write the persuasive essay has always been challenging for me and frankly, one that I loathed to teach because it was difficult to present it in such a way that reached the diverse learners in my room. However, this resource book has been my saving grace. It is packed with fantastic & fun ideas and breaks it down to a level that my middle school students could understand...all of them (and so many of them felt successful)! I had such an enjoyable time this past year teaching the persuasive with this book that I actually look forward to teaching it again (with Twisting Arms right by my side). If you are a middle school teacher, I highly encourage you to buy this book. Now, I wish the same author would come out with a resource book for the narrative and response to literature."
2,Dissappointing,"I teach persuasive writing and I was hoping this would give me a few ideas, but I was disappointed. I didn't think it was written all that well and it didn't really give me any new material. It probably would help some, but this just isn't my style."
5,Recommended for serious students of the paranormal,"When her son Paul died suddenly, Judith Chisholm discovered that death is not the end of our existence, but merely a change of form. She found that our loved ones are just a heartbeat away in another world. Voices From Paradise: How The Dead Speak To Us is the story of her discovery and her consequent journey from death and despair to revelation and hope. Very highly recommended for serious students of the paranormal and metaphysics, Voices From Paradise clearly lays out how we can access our beloved departed and communicate with those that have gone before us."
4,Miffy books,Daughter enjoyed them as a toddler - buying for grand- daughter. Large simple pictures appeal to 8+ month old baby but text is too long. We flip through pages with baby and simplify the story.
5,Lovely book for little ones,"Our 3-year old daughter has loved Miffy for a while. The simply pictures and stories leave much to the imagination, and generally apply to real-life toddler and pre-schooler situation. Very recognizable."
4,cover,I have qustion is this item have world cherokee in the chrom or we dont have any world in the itemI mean this item is this clear or have print chrokee inside
2,Goofy,"I found this book after doing a search of Julia Quinn's novels on Amazon. I saw it received rave reviews, so I bought it. I literally saved it for a special day when I had time enjoy a good read; boy, was I disappointed.The two main characters were constantly bickering. Their encounters were supposed to be humorous, but they were goofy and ridiculous. The parts that were supposed to be laugh-out-loud funny were only slightly amusing. I did not feel like these two characters got well enough aquainted to fall in love, so the romance fell flat for me.This book was too cheesy to recommend. Instead read the Bridgerton Series ~ The Viscount Who Loved Me, When He Was Wicked, and It's In His Kiss were my favorites."
3,Not as good as her others,"I loved her previous romances, especially Splendid and Brighter than the Sun, and appreciate her wonderful sense of humor. Unfortunately, the characters and plot were rather flat. This book did have many amusing moments, but it was disappointing in comparison to her best works."
1,2 hours squandered........,".....so this unmarried unchaperoned 20 something year old (England 1814) just got kidnapped by ""the most frightening man she has ever seen"" and she is busy playing games with him not in the least bit fearful for her life, or at least her reputation???Such is Ms Quinn's writing style...This book and its idea is very immature, asinine, undeveloped, humorless, witless and ridiculously interminable.Such is Ms Quinn's writing style.......Why do I even bother anymore???Once bitten, twice shy......."
2,AN OK READ....,"I have just discovered Quinn. Fortunately, I have read some of her previous novels before reading this one. If I had started with this novel, I would not have continued reading her works. I was disappointed with this book. The zaniness (is that a word?) is still there. Her work is generally light hearted fun. But I didn't see a whole lot of warmth in the hero. He was just one lost tortured soul clinging to memories of his dead love. He just didn't deserve the heroine. However, I did like his friend. The plot was interesting in a convoluted manner but something I could forego in the future. This book was ok...but if you could find her other books, I would recommend those first. You could probably bypass this one and not be missing out on much. I am currently reading ""Minx"" which I am very much enjoying."
2,Diappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. I special ordered this book and, was all excited to read it,Boy was I in for a let down. I didn't even finish it, it was sooo boring! The hero was always so angry at the heroine through most of the book, and the heroine was always joking it was like she didn't know how to be serious. now I love a humorous romance but when the time warrents seriousness The heroine just couldn't or wouldn't get serious.Then there was the hero's dead fiance that had died five years previous to the start of the book, and he felt so guilty over her death that, thats all you read about. GET OVER IT already! As for the passion and heat in this book there wasn't any. I like my romance books with a lot more passion and heat,I also like my romances were the hero and heroine are not at each others throats from page one till the end. I like when the hero and heroine get along through most of the book."
4,Another JQ hit!,I loved this book! It was wonderful! I felt some parts lagged a bit and that the scene was longer than needed but it was still a great book. The characters were funny and believable and I loved them. Great read!
3,Silly but somewhat entertaining,"This story borders on the absurdly silly but it qualifies as a ""to read"" if one is desperate for an escape that requires no thinking.2.5/5.0"
2,"Sorry, Ms. Quinn","This is the third book I have read by Julia Quinn. The first was the Duke and I (I loved it!) the second was An Offer from A Gentleman (Equally loved it!)- the third, To Catch an Heiress -- I haven't even finished it. I just can't get thru it. Caroline seems more like an 11 year old girl and Blake at times seems younger than that. I enjoy the romances where the hero and heroine spar off of each other - it keeps me interested, but this was just pure ridiculous. I haven't yet looked up the copyright to see if this was her very first book ever, but I do know that this is not going to sit up on my keeper shelf with the other two of her books I have read. I hope this is the only bad apple in her list of books, because I just bought all of them based on what I enjoyed with the Duke and I and Offer from a Gentleman. This is a library or book exchange book only - do not waste your money. Sorry."
3,Cardboard-Cut Romance,"To Catch an Heiress is a fun, easy read, but it's no classic; what makes the book so easy to read is its light banter and thin plot. Most of Julia Quinn's novels follow the same structure - but who cares? As long as the girl down on her luck gets the dashing duke, it's all good! As a high school junior, it was a relief to take a break from studying physics to read this romance."
5,A must read book !,this is a very good book and everyone should read it! =) this is my fifth book by her and I love her writings! SHe is the best! one of my favourite authors....
3,Buy it used,"This is my next to the least favorite of Julia Quinn's. Although she writes about interesting characters, I found the story too light, and too predictable. I suggest if you want this; to get a used copy of it. If you want to read something well worth the price, I would try Duke and I, The Viscount Who Loved Me, Dancing at Midnight, and Splendid. Now those are great books!"
2,NOT ONE OF HER BEST,"I generally enjoy Quinn's works, but I found that I did not like the main characters in the book. He had way too much emotional baggage. It seemed like he was brooding about his dead fiancee constantly throughout the book. The story line was dull and the characters never did seem to hit it off. I prefer reading about characters with less psychological problems. However, I did enjoy the subsequent book - How to Marry A Marquis."
2,IT'S AN OK READ...,I bought this book after I read Minx. I bought several other books by Quinn too. I hope her other books are better than this one because I was very disappointed with this one. There were some funny moments in the book but it couldn't make up for the boring characters and the dumb plot. There was no spark with the hero and heroine. I really would not recommend the book.
1,"The story was captivating at first, but quickly became dull.","This is the first book I have read by Julia Quinn and will be my last. Perhaps, I should say ""started"". The conversations between the main characters were asinine and I lost interest with only one-third of the book read. If you are looking for a strong-willed, and intelligent heroine, as well as humor, I suggest you read ""Hearts Aflame"" by Johanna Lindsey."
3,Not my favorite...,I was really looking forward to this book and wasn't impressed. Too much bickering and fighting between the main characters. Boring and draggy.Ms Quinn has done much much better than this.
2,NOT A TERRIBLE BOOK BUT....,"Not a terrible book, but not one of her best. Some humor but still very boring. The dead fiancee that keeps appearing is somewhat distracting and not at all romantic. I have read a couple of her other books so I will not give up on Quinn. Lets hope the next book is better than this one."
4,Be sure to catch this story!,TO CATCH AN HEIRESS is a delightful story that not to be missed! Follow up with How To Marry A Marquis!
4,Julia Quinn is the best!,"Caroline Trent needed to get out of her living situation and fast! Blake Ravenscroft takes one look at the woman escaping into the night, and mistaking her for someone else, ties her up and captures her. When he realizes his mistake (with the help of his friend James Sidwell) he also comes to learn that Caroline has no intention of being returned to the care of her abusive uncle. The two soon unite, both for the good of their common cause and by falling in love! I loved the characters and their interaction. I also loved the roll that james Sidwell had in finally getting them together!Don't miss James' own novel ""How to Marry a Marquis"" which also has an appearence from Lady Danbury of the ""Bridgerton"" novels. I love that her books are all interconnected! She is a brilliant author!"
1,DId not fit,This was a piece of junk and did not fit my 99 RAM. The defrost holes didn't line up and was a very poor fit. Don't waste you $$$
5,Explores the new concepts of living and working,How should individuals and businesses be changing in order to succeed in a digital world? Evolve! shows answers may be found not in cyberspace but in communities where people interact: Kanter explores the new concepts of living and working with computers which are likely to change organizations and how relationships network.
1,The worst novelisation I have ever read,"The Gladiator is the best film I have ever seen, and this book is an insult. All the events are mixed up and and the dialogue is from another script. As I always do while reading novelisation, I tried to follow the book while picturing the film in my head but with this piece of garbage it was simply impossible. Take my word for it do not buy this book"
3,"Entertaining, but not very well written.","This was an entertaining read, but it isn't written very well, and it was very different from the movie. and don't buy it unless you've seen the movie, as it does give quite a lot away."
2,Disappointed,"I have seen the movie twice now - and loved it - but there were holes in the plot that I was hoping the book would fill. It didn't. I was hoping to find out about Maximus' and Lucilla's previous relationship and also that of Commodus and Maximus. Unfortunately, the book is basically a script for the movie with very little additional story or depth. Save your money and go see the movie again."
3,"mediocre, could have been better,go to the movie instead","i never did like movie tie-in novels aka novelizations, they took away the essence of the movie, it usually borrows the info directly off the screenplay which i highly recommend reading rather than the novelization, in this case, the novel Gladiator doesn't do much credit to fully accentuate the marvelous plots and visualry of the movie, Ridley Scott made a stunning thought provoking historical drama that is very hard to condense into a paperbook..the language is off and it tries too hard to be more informative about the movie..honestly, dont read this before watching the movie, the only benefit of this book is that it may enchance some parts of the movie..a really good novelization is Randall Wallace's memoir of his ancestry in Braveheart...yeah Maximus! definitely stick the movie! OSCAR here we come!"
5,Perfect for Toddlers,"My daughter LOVES this soap! It is perfect for potty training in learning to wash hands. The green color is fun and gives a child something that is their own, making hand washing fun. And the smell is great! I was disappointed when our local stores quit carrying this in stock but SO excited to see it's an AMAZON!"
3,Australians are fat idiots,Australians eat this crap as much as Americans but they're also Euro-trash wannabes. G'day!
1,No More Junk Food. Hit the Jim.,"This documentary should have never gotten anywere near an oscar nomination. ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was robed. All this documentary is about some guy who loves eating burgers and fries at fast food resturants what the point in that, how can people love this. America is the fattest country enough as it is and this dvd is a bad influnce."
1,Who cares?,"Well I am proud that this man has proved fast food is not healthy. He has now shown us the truth, thank god for him! Without him I would have thought McDonalds was a nice weight loss diet, but after I saw this I was clearly convinced that McDonalds is, indeed, bad for your health!Don't waste your money on this, it's common sense, people!"
1,Aweful,"no plot, it was more like a bad documentary...bad camera, bad actors, not funny, and boring all of the time."
3,flawed,"I must say I was a little disappointed with this film. Although it was very funny to watch, it did not prove at all that all that McDonald's is unhealthy! I still go there every now and then. Of course you get sick when you always take the biggest meal three times a day. You will get sick NO MATTER WHAT YOU EAT, when you consume 5000 calories a day!! The film has a smell of cheap sensationalism. It does not make the effort to prove that MD is unhealthy in a scientific and serious way.A women, I forgot her name, made the same experiment, but she took healthy food choices and limited calories. She actually LOST WEIGHT! Her cholesterol stabilized and she did not feel sick at all.I still give the film 3 stars, because it was at least great fun to watch."
4,4 stars only because now my craving for fast food has gone,I can't imagine why this person did this 30 days of McDonald's food - but it was a good study - not only McD's is mentioned. I think every adult should see this - every parent surely who thinks running through the drive thru a couple times a week is healthy for young children. I think parts of this video are a bit graphic for pre-teens for sure - but I plan to show it to my grandchildren in a few years. If I could trust my daughter in law to do something about it - I'd give it to her to view. Whatever happened to family dinner in?
4,Very Interesting film - I get the same reaction...,"This is a very thought-provoking film (if you are not a McNeocon minion). I get the same reaction as the filmmaker whenever I ate that McGarbage - this film just reinforces my willpower to continue to stay away from that ""food"".I think the most important point, the one that the critics of this film (Madison Ave. mind-slaves) missed, is that corporations are drowning our society in this garbage and that the fast-food ""healthy"" menu items are mostly just as bad as the ""regular"" stuff.I agree that people have to accept responsibility for eating this junk but the McCorporations have to do the same for selling it in schools to kids and for pressuring the government to give them carte-blanche to distribute this junk.They should show this film in every school in America."
4,Good movie!,"I saw Super Size Me at a film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I just saw Muffin Man and these movies are saying the same thing - in very different ways. Super Size Me is just for the quick laugh. Yes, it's very funny - but somewhat superficial in my opinion. Muffin Man is a sly, dark, subtle jab at all of society, not just the obese. Get them both and have a double sized double feature!"
5,Fast Delivery,"Good film to watch, especially in the academic arena. I use it for teaching argumentative writing, but should be viewed by adults. Contains some foul language."
3,porno for judgemental health police,"I think this was an interesting film so I give it 3 stars, but it left me cold. It was too long a piece for such narcissism. He seemed to lasciviously enjoy his revulsion for the fast-food industry and for fat people. ""OOOOOhhhh, it is so disgusting! Let's look at some more!"" What a turn off. He seemed to really exploit that little fat kid, and have contempt for the Subway guy, who at least should get credit for losing 100+ pounds and trying to help other obese people.It seems like food, fat, and fear of fat is like the new forbidden sex. Change the words and images and you'd think the new food police were preachers talking about sex 100 years ago. This push to be ""pure"", to deny the body, to restrict, to look with disgust at the self-indulgence of others....it all seems so petty, fear-driven and judgemental.Incidentally, I am not obese and I never eat at McDonalds. I don't eat there because the food is awful, not just because it is unhealthful."
3,Junk movie about junk food,"I found this film to be mildly amusing but not much else. Spurlock would have made a better case against junk food if he had eaten only one major meal a day at a variety of fast food restaurants, not just McDonalds. If Spurlock suffered any negative health consequences from this more reasonable and realistic approach, then that would show something. Eating one type of food all the time, even broccoli, is not healthy. Also, Spurlock did nothing to show the converse, that eating healthy food leads to better health. The only fact of value that Spurlock presented was the woeful state of public school lunches. But the movie wasn't really supposed to be about that."
5,Supersize me,"Yeah, so its not a big break through that Mcdonalds is bad for your health, but nonetheless this documentary entertains me. The part thats really humorous is when he visits the schools and asks him how they serve their lunches while he tracks down people that buy outrageous things as lunches. Its worth the rental if you want to have some fun"
1,Garbage.,This is independent filmmaking for morons. Of course if you pig out at McDonald's for a month you'll gain weight. This guy is an ass. If you want something more intelligent that will inspire you to eat healthy and avoid fast food read Fast Food Nation.
2,Mildly interesting,"While this film has it's interesting statistics I can't help but find the entire point to be so obvious. If you do ANYTHING three times a day you will find that it is harmful. The ancient Greeks said ""everything in moderation""!! They should film a documentary about a man exercising excessively everyday, I bet he would have many health problems as well. McDonalds is on the hot seat while the movie theater you're sitting in is putting extra butter on your popcorn. In other words people....you have choices in life. If you need a movie to tell you Big Macs aren't a healthy alternative then I weep for you."
1,glutton,"Watch the obnoxious glutton jam greasy fast food in his mouth, watch the obnoxious glutton attempt to talk with his mouth full of same, and, finally, watch the obnoxious glutton literally puke his guts out.Hey, we know greasy fast food can kill you, so why stuff yourself silly (like a damn fool) to prove this point?I gave the DVD away; I didn't want it anywhere near my other DVDs."
3,"Entertaining, yet highly unscientific","Morgan Spurlock conducts an ""experiment"" on McDonalds food resulting in conclusions that have no scientific validity based on the fact that he violates almost all the guidelines of the scientific method. None of the outcomes should be taken seriously, only as a matter of entertainment. For more information read about proper experimental control, dependent and independent variables, spurious relationships, and the scientific method."
1,"Not a documentary,Just a [...]satirical mess",This is not a documentary but it seemed like a satire about fast-foods.Morgan Spurlick embarrasses himself by being an [...] and eating McDonald's for a month and just to see how fat he gets and the movie is slow and not interesting and for a so-called documentary it seemed gross like the scene were Morgan barfed up his food and the director shows us a shot of the puke and the movie was badly made it looked like somebody got a camcorder and made this on a shoe-string budget(even a cartoon has a higher budget than this).Avoid this [...]waste of time and eat McDonald's.Make your own mind what to do.
2,"Slightly Entertaining, Slightly Informative","I just finished watching this DVD. It has about ten minutes worth of useful information about the fast food industry. This information includes nutritional data, the industry's marketing tactics (targetting small children), alarming statistics on the obesity ""epidemic"" sweeping the U.S., and... well, actually that's about it. The rest of this 'documentary' is Morgan Spurlock stuffing his face with the largest, greasiest meals that money can buy and sitting around - he even uses a pedometer to make sure he doesn't get too much exercise - attributing every little ache and pain experiences over the course of a month to the ""toxicity"" of McDonald's food.If you have been somehow deluded into thinking fast food was actually good for you, this might be an informative watch. Otherwise, I'm sure you can dig up any useful information contained herein by simply searching google for five or ten minutes."
4,McIcky,"Morgan Spurlock's documentary - in which he consumes nothing but McDonald's food for a month in 2003 - is funny, cleverly produced, and somewhat alarmist. It's not good science, but does offer some interesting social commentary on the power of the fast food/commercial food industry and is one man's rather striking video exercise in culinary self-abuse. The personalities (girlfriend, medical/nutrition folks, people on the street) were interesting. Most importantly to me Spurlock makes his point without being unnessarily mean. His various asides were also quite good, especially his forays into what public school systems can do to more responsibly exercise their in loco parentis duties as they care for our children."
4,"Hilarious, informative and silly","This guy makes a documentary that says if you eat nothing but McDonald's for 30 days and you eat the whole freaking meal everytime, then you will get fat. Big surprise. But quite comical. I think it is a good wake up call that America really does want fresh, good food, there is just nowhere to get it. Hopefully this will spur some entrepreneur to start a new chain of good food - rather than fast food.As for the allegations of wrong doing on McDonald's part, I still don't buy it. McDonald's offers a very convenient product at a great price. It is unfortunate that some people overindulge. Perhaps we should tax them more to pay for the increased medical costs of obesity. But they are indespensible on road trips when I don't know where else to go! And the kids need a little playground.Still, a good warning to cut down on fast food, eat healthy and exercise!"
4,Super Size Me,This movie makes you think about what we are doing to our bodies by eating all this junk. Because of this we eat very little fast food.
3,be careful before you share this,I liked the film content.however I shared this film with some clients I hardly knew and they were shocked at the language.There is supposed to be a family friendly version coming out.
3,Exaggerated movie..plenty of options,"The movie was rather interesting, however, I noticed several areas where it was exaggerated. First, he did not exercise while on his McDiet. Second, with severl healthy options at McDonalds, he chose to eat only the foods with the high fat content. A hamburger and small fries has less than 500 calories. You can also have the salads without dressing, and that constitutes healthy. Also, holding back on condiments such as mayonaise on a McChicken sandwich drastically reduces the calories."
1,Pointless & Absurd,"I saw this during a ""free"" viewing of Showtime on DirecTV. Okay, so this guy eats what amounts to eight or nine meals a day at McDonald's, doesn't exercise, and blames the corporation when he gains weight? Oh, please...Hey, Spurlock and those of you who love this so-called documentary; IT'S CALLED ""PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY""! LOOK INTO IT!I agree that the typical American diet is far from ideal, but far-fetched, ridiculous stunts like this add nothing to the discourse."
2,Who knew that fast food was bad for you?,"McDonalds food isn't healthy? No! Next you will tell us that Krispy Kreme donuts are bad for you. Seriously, this movie was at times entertaining and even funny. However, it seems to me that it just buys into the whole ""everybody is a victim"" and ""nothing is my fault"" mentality that fuels so many ludicrous law suits in America. If you want to see a great documentary, try ""Spellbound"" or ""2000 Miles to Maine"". If you want to see a movie with an axe to grind, then you will probably like ""Super Size Me""."
1,Tedious,This has to be hands down one of the most boring storylines the so called script writers in Hollywood have ever dreamed up. I thought he was going to become the size of King Kong and go on a rampage destroying buildings and stamping on people with his feet. Instead he just put on a bit of weight then lost it again. Boring. I'm suprised the good people of McDonalds put their name to this - if anything they came out of it looking bad.
5,A MUST see for everyone...fat and skinny!,"This video is a real eye-opener for me, about obesity and Americans. I am not considered 'obese' in the medical field....but, I have now lost 30 lbs and this movie kept me motivated (or disgusted) enough to make sure I make this life-change forever. I recommend this movie to everyone!!! I showed my son, 13, my boyfriend and his son, 9, to make a serious impression on their futures. I know you can watch this movie for free over the internet, but, I bought it so that I can offer it to anyone, friends, co-workers, family...etc...so they would not have an excuse to NOT watch it! Way to go Morgan. You did not jeopardize your health in vain. I am very grateful to you, for changing many, many lives.Sincerely,Lighter in Texas."
3,"An, er, revelation","In which we learn that fast food, when consumed excessively and for long periods of time, can cause some health problems."
4,"good info, but a bit slow","The experiment performed in this documentary is an important one. The outcome, though expected, is still amazing. Hopefully this will encourage people to eat healthy and to work on our children to make sure that they don't get hooked on a lifetime of fast food."
3,Lots of skips,"I received the item very quickly. The CD would not play in my laptop ... wrong zone or something. I'm not sure if that could have been corrected on my laptop. So, I put it in my DVD player. The CD has lots of skips and didn't play smoothly."
2,Overrated,"While a fairly interesting idea, this movie doesn't really bring any scientific or sociological insight into fast food. You mean if I eat at McDonald's every day, every meal for a month, I'll get sick? D'uh. Combine this conspicuous insight with Mr. Banzhaf's banal stage presence and you've got yourself a pretty mediocre documentary."
2,McDuh!,"I'm sorry, but it is not McDonalds fault that America is so fat. America is fat because people eat to much and exercise to little. Get the freedom fries out of your ears and make some changes! I just can't stand this ""it's not my fault"" attitude! Is McDonalds holding us at gun point? Are they forcing us to eat this greesy crap? NO!!!! The choice is ours if we smoke, drink, eat fattening foods and so on. So let's stop blaming Phillip Morris and the food giants and take a better look at our fat, lazy, irresponsible selves."
1,Super Size Me Movie,I was very disappointed in this movie. It was listed as a PG movie. My son was getting it for a class project. When we got it in the mail it was a PG-13. We watched it and I couldn't believe the bad language. It also talked about sex and drugs. I couldn't believe they put it on the internet as a PG. Even as PG-13 it was very dissappointing.
2,Super Size Me,"I assume you know the premise. Dude eats nothing but McDonalds for a month. I shall furthermore assume you've read my newsletter before, so you know my opinion of McDonalds is not high. My new neighbor loaned me the DVD that I'd spent months searching for. Let's watch it.I laughed out loud more than once during the first 20 minutes. Culminating with the McPuke. But eventually, there was a sense of being beaten over the head with a blinding flash of the obvious. Yup, I just mixed some metaphors.Is there anyone reading this who doesn't know that McDonalds is unhealthy? Filmmaker knew he was riding a one-trick pony, so he threw in some interviews with folks who should be interviewed for such a film. At first, informative. Later, silly. Finally, he lost all credibility in my eyes. I hate to say that. But this film took a perfectly good premise and did nothing with it."
2,a great movie for people who can't think for themselves,"its a shame that people can only learn about the sins of mcdonalds from a movie. i for one don't need a movie to tell me that mcdonalds food is bad for your health. to me, this film isn't about mcdonalds, but the culture of people who choose to eat in these kinds of places. the movie had the right idea, and i enjoyed it, but there is nothing groundbreaking to me about the facts in this movie. to all of you who won't eat at mcdonalds after seeing this movie: there is no sense changing this habit b/c i'm sure you will replace it with another that is equally bad for you. or, just wait for a pro-mcdonalds documentary to tell you what to think."
1,silly,"Morgan Spurlock is overyly dramatic, lacks charisma, and just gets annoying. On his first Mcdonalds meal he pukes it up because it was just too much, what a whimp. This could have made an interesting segment on a show like 20/20, dateline, or 60 minutes, but not a full lenght picture. Don't waste time with ""Supersize ME"""
3,Good stuff!! ..,"This documentary has a few flaws, nobody will have 3 meals from McDonald for 30 days unless he/she is crazy, but point is well taken. I use to go to McDonald sometime but after watching this dvd I have stopped going to McDonald. Every parent should watch this and educated their children about Fast Food."
1,Lies,Watch Fat-Head and you will understand. You can't even get a copy of the food log he made during this to see what he ate.I watched this then I watched Fat head.http://www.amazon.com/Fat-Head-Tom-Naughton/dp/B001NRY6R2/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top
3,Worth three stars for humor.,"Hmmmm...where to start. First off, this documentary was apparantly released in order to confirm what anyone with an elementary school education already knows: junk food is bad for you. The film maker, Morgan Spurlock, is so fed up with the way Mcdonalds abuses the benefits of capitolism, that he puts his foot down in protest and patronizes Mcdonalds exclusively for one month, in turn, proving that eating like a pig makes one fat.This man portrays his actions as if he is making some type of revolutionary public service announcement, but in reality he is only adding to the profit of the very corporation he is against and leaving himself out of shape. He does all of this for one reason and one reason alone, to sell the film and make money. The irony is priceless.I think I am going to sue Morgan Spurlock for the constant headaches I recieve after bashing my face into my coffee table repeatedly while watching this film."
1,This movie is just plain silly,"What was so groundbreaking about this film? He stuffs himself daily with fast-food (3x a day to be exact) for a month and viewers are supposed to be shocked that Mr. Spurlock gains weight and doesn't feel well after the month is over? Is this some sort of revelation? Shall we call call 60 Minutes? Even the doctors he consults with prior to going on this binge warn him that his experiment might have some unwanted effects. No kidding!I know a lot of people who are overweight, some to the point where it's now affected their health drastically. It's not because they eat McDonald's 90x a month. It's because they have poor dietary habits in general and don't exercise. One can gain a lot of unhealthy weight simply by eating home cooked meals high in fat and being a couch potato. That's all it takes."
4,Never buying McDonalds again!,This dvd was very good but has also ended my consumption of McDonalds food...I guess I should thank them for that!!!
5,A Real McEye-opener,"I just saw this film this evening, and might I say I am shocked. I am proud to say that I have not eaten McDonald's in years. Just the same, this movie was horrifying. What happened to this man was just insane. To gain 25 pounds in a month! That is amazing. The facts that he presented are also alarming. I cannot fathom why schools would give in and serve this disgusting food. My old high school was strongly considering it, last I heard. I think everyone needs to see this movie. America needs to eat better."
4,"Good satire, social criticism","Finally rented Super Size Me last night. Not quite Michael Moore, over the top, laugh a minute satire. In fact, he seemed to be trying to do more of a documentary with funny moments. (The guy who's rail-thin and eats 2-5 Big Macs per day, every day, was a hilarious addition.) And although McD's bears the brunt of the examination, some other segments are more disturbing, especially the school cafeteria part. I did think it lapses into some yellow journalism some of the time: I thought the dark, whispering, gasping for breath confessional to the camera (a la Blair Witch) that death could come at any moment, was a bit much. Oh, and the stomach stapling was pretty gross. But certainly an enjoyable film."
4,Recommended along with the Fast Food Nation,"It is funny and outrageous at the same time. Everyone knows that fast food is not good for health, but I never thought that the film-maker would actually go ahead and perform that kind of experiment on his body. Now you know what happens when you eat too much fast food. Even if nobody will actually replicate that kind of experiment for his eating style, you know that in the long run it will poison your entire body system. So wake up, eat healthy food, exercise, get plenty of rest, sleep well, learn about nutrition and how our country is being run by corporations."
4,Not too preachy...,"One of the things I liked most about this film is that it does not take itself too seriously (most documentaries--Michael Moore included--do). I'm sure that, for the most part, Spurlock is preaching to the choir, but hopefully some parents who see this will think twice about taking their kids to McD's just because it's quick and easy.Sure, most people know that fast food isn't healthy, but unfortunately too many of us need an occasional (or frequent) reminder of the consequences of unhealthy habits. This movie is as entertaining as entertaining as it is educational.There were a couple of scenes I could have done without (particularly his first 'Super Size' experience), but overall, thumbs up."
4,Mc Donalds,"I will never eat Mc Donalds again. This is not a slick film, but it is real and shows the ups and downs of this type of project. It is clear that anyone who eats this type of food for every meal is a nutter. What about a sequel though run over the course of a year? On second thoughts don't, I don't want someone's death on my conscience."
5,Will open your eyes about what you eat,"Do we all know fast food isn't good for you? Of course. But we don't know just how dangerous it can be-and that one of those dangers is a drug-like addiction that will keep you coming back for more, which is exactly what the fast food companies want.Want to know the details? Watch this movie. But be prepared to second guess your eating habits when you do."
3,title,"I don't think the film is really made to criticize McDonalds as a company, it's clear that Americans decided to make it their favourite fast-food restaurant. What it really hopes to do is take a place people love to eat and show what obesity over 3 or more years will do to your body. He managed to show this in 30 days and its a great reminder for anyone."
4,Where's the Beef?,"I was late in discovering this movie, although certainly I was familiar with the title. In all honesty it doesn't surprise me that eating Mickey D's for 90 meals straight would be unhealthy. But I enjoy independent film and it took some chutzpah for Morgan to do what he did, not only in terms of taking on Goliath but also of challenging his own health. In the end it took him much longer to lose the weight than it did to put it on, but such cost did not come without reward: soon after the movie premiered, McDonalds got rid of the SuperSize menu (even though they won't admit there was any connection!).The commentary (with Morgan and his girlfriend, the vegan chef) is very fun and the bonus interview with Eric Schlosser is excellent."
5,Super Super Size me!,"In the manner of Michael Moore, Spulock has created a wonderful documentary. Funny, revolting, scary and suspenseful are just some of the many and conflicting tags you could put on this film. A should-see for parents; a must-see for anyone on a diet. So much information, you need to see it more than once. Can't wait for the DVD, so I can have my own copy"
2,ok...they forced me to watch it in school! but ive seen it before then,this movie was good the first time but after that it turned REALLY anoying really fast...
2,This is somewhat misleading,"While in general terms, junk food is obviously bad for you, I found this document somewhat misleading, mainly because the reporter went on a 30-day diet of only McDonald's products for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Throughout this time, he always oversized, overate and of course, he fell sick.The average person who eats at fast food restaurants don't do so every day, nor do they eat such exhorbitant amounts at once.This whole thing was a gross exaggeration."
2,Tell me something I don't know,McDonalds and fast food is bad for your health. Yeah and? This film didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. The only reason to watch it is to see this moron almost kill himself. I had McDonalds for dinner right after viewing this film. And I enjoyed it. And I'm not over weight.
2,Blech.,"There was some disgusting truth in there, but the whole thing was entirely too unscientific for my tastes. The facts could have spoken for themselves without working himself into vomitting drama over it. What kind of man can't eat a fast food meal without throwing up? His sense of humor, biased tone, and creepy girlfriend were all annoying."
4,Fun documentary!,"The movie was entertaining. It was not so much an indictment of McDonalds, but of the whole fast food industry. He picked on McDonalds because it is the most well known and its market focus is children. Yes, we need to take personal responsibility for our decisions on what we eat and how much we exercise. However, the food industry's budgets for advertising and their lobbies are gigantic. They focus on children and they market to schools. The movie is one sided, but so is advertising. The experiment is extreme, but not that extreme. Some people eat at McDonalds every day. He is one-sided; however, he does identify his biases and tries to make his case in an entertaining way.I was convicted, educated and entertained by a movie. Who can ask for anything more in a documentary?"
1,DEATH OF COMMON SENSE,It's hard for me to believe that so many people think this is a brilliant and startling film. How could you not know that eating so much fast food is unhealthy? If this film is considered groundbreaking then I fear for our Republic.
4,newlydeds,"like faster pussycat, this la glam/goth group is fronted by singer taime down. not overly great, but not terrible either. should satisfy some tastes. they are in the vein of london after midnight, but definitely not as good. most tracks are very listenable. give this a try. great name for a group."
4,TAIME HAS LEFT THE CATS BUT STILL KICKS AND CLAWS TO THE TOP,Faster Pussycat industrial style? Not exactly...Taime proves he is multi-talented and lyrically superb with the self-titled c.d. Very simaliar to NIN yet the Newlydeads stands in a class by himself. If the Self-titled Newlydeads c.d. is any indication of where Taime is moving lyrically and musically - his future looks bright. It's not exactly Faster Pussycat (I loved them) but the Newlydeads Smokes!!
4,Taime kicked ass with this one!,Almost perfect. Taime Downe deserves more credit and recognition for his wonderful music.
5,Extreme Sports: American Samurai,"Bill writes in a straight forward, no-nonsense style. He gets straight to the point and he is right on target. Bill explains the what, why and how of 20 of the most important concepts for anyone wishing to create an effective manufacturing organization.For example, lesson 1 is: Management's obsession with outcomes must be abandoned and replaced by process improvement activites. And it gets better from there."
1,very unhappy,i was very upset about how the product quality was the item worked for 20 min the completely ceased i had to buy one from a local show for more $$ and it took even longer for me to get my car back working on the other hand the shipping was quick i paid for 2 day i got it in 2days yet it was 27 more bucks whitch i probly wont get back i returned the item this morning in the same packageing it came in with the ups information provided for return i am now going to wait for the refund this is the first time i have had to return a item on amazon i hope this works well and doesnt turn into a head ach
1,This book lacked information and was poorly written.,"This book had a ""yeah"" for homosexuals and I believe that that was very unproffesional. When I found this book I was interested in reading what the cover told about it, however all it did is supply me with useless information and I wish I could get my money back for not liking it!"
2,Mediocre For Quick Recipes,"This book was not bad for quick recipe ideas. However, please note:If you are looking for recipes with meat full of flavor, this is NOT the book for you. The meat will not be flavorful. This cookbook basically combines ingredients and one can of your favorite Campbell's soup. In the end, the result will be mediocre gravy over a bland piece of chicken/meat.On the plus side, since you are using canned soup, you could replace regular soup with low salt/fat soup, which would be very healthy. However, you would be compromising more of the flavor, which I would not suggest.So, if you are looking for a quick dinner and are not too concerned with flavor, this would be fine."
2,Not a Microwave Book,This is not a microwave cookbook. I don't know why it is in this section. Waste of money since I only have a microwave.
5,DDRock Rocks,What can I say? This CD rocks! Every note of every song stays with you and affects you potently. Dean is a great artist and a great person ...his live show is full of energy .BUY THIS CD NOW....go on...what are you waiting for....BUY IT....NOOOOOW
1,Warning about washing,"We initially were pleased with the quality and how well it fit our extra deep mattress. The terry top is very plush and adds an extra softness to the sheets. However we recently spilled orange juice on our bedding and washed the pad just in case it had gone through all layers of sheets. We followed the instructions on tag and washed/dried it separately on low/gentle heat. Horrible results! The pad came out with holes, burn marks, and the elastic in the sides completely melted. If you need to wash it, I would do so by hand and hang dry. I had planned to do that until the tag said machine washing was fine. Manf. should update tag so others won't ruin an expensive item so easily."
5,Love this Mattress Pad,This mattress pad is so soft I almost didn't want to put a sheet over it. Very easy to fit onto the bed. I am very pleased with the product!
2,Too big and low quality,Those switches are much bigger then you think they are.Low quality and flimsy.However they do work.
5,Great,"My movie came on time, it was just as described, and with no damage. I am very pleased with my product."
3,not bad,The movie claims to be better than Napolean Dynamite but it's quite far behind in my opinon. It made me laugh a little here and there but it's not something I would recommend.
3,The Sasquatch Gang,"""The Sasquatch Gang"" is okay if you don't mind watching a silly movie. It is probably a waste of time to watch, but I did anyway. I hoped it would be better.I think I would recommend it more for teenagers and maybe 20 somethings. I am much older which is probably why it was almost too silly for my taste."
5,Such a funny movie,"This movie is a lot like Napoleon Dynamite, so if your didn't like that movie, you might not like this one. I, however, thought this was a very cute movie. Clean and family-friendly. 5 stars!"
4,"""Seriously? You're Havin' Nuggets Tonight?""","This delightfully offbeat story concerns a group of teenaged fantasy-obsessed outcasts who spend their time sparring with giant foam weapons and watching ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""The Crow"". When the main character's neighbor, Zerk (Justin Long, in what may be his best role yet as the quintessential 'townie') needs money to pay off a credit card he used 6 years ago for $5.17 and never paid back, he decides to stage a Bigfoot sighting, complete with a giant ""Sasquatch Dumpling"". When the outcasts stumble (literally) upon the spoor, they alert the media and suffer the effects of jealousy and first loves. Don't expect a lot of depth or even plot, but do expect enough unusual characters and one-liners to keep you entertained. Joey Kern is quite good as the character, Shirts, who is a dead ringer for Mike from ""American Movie""."
5,WATCH THIS MOVIEEEEEEE,The Sasquatch Gang is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life. Its so good that I watched it 5 times in one day... its one of those movies that you can just watch repeatedly and never get tired of. Give it a chance! Its hilarious!
3,Glider,"Not bad for the money, pads are thin and small, arms are not very sturdy. Mechanism on the glider works fine. Basically you get what you pay for."
2,Awesome Movie Junk DVD Production,"I originally saw this movie on Showtime and loved it. So of course when I found a palce that actually carried the DVD I was excited to purchase it. I recieved it only to find there was no menu and NONE of the special features that are advertised on the back cover of the DVD case were there. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed, I returned it and got a replacement and THAT DVD didn't have them either!! I was appalled."
5,Soldier's Girl,The movie started out slow. The charters played there parts every well. I also liked the music that was played during the movie. It was tromatic off and on threw out the movie. It was a excellent movie!
3,Soldier's Girl from a sister,"The movie is interesting, but I don't care much for the violence, however realistic it may have been and faithful to a terrible situation. I think the movie does a service to show some of the unbalanced aspects of the military towards those outside of an accepted group, in this case, those whose friends and lovers do not conform to the stereotype of the opposite sex and gender. I am not sure why the movie does not engage me; rather it scares me. I have been scared enough in my life, and I would rather have more hope each day, and not less. The acting is convincing; the story true; the issue important, but I guess I would rather be left with hope that my countrymen and women in the military wouldn't be able to see who I am, and if one of their own were to fall in love with me, would have the decency to afford him the most basic of human rights.Paula"
5,this movie is based on a true life i love it.,this movie is really heart breaking the guy in this movie gets the raw deal you really must buy this and watch i gurantee you you will fall in love with this one.
3,An intriguing subject to follow!,When I first saw this DVD I had no idea it featured a ransgendered male and was transfixed by it as the 'story' unfolded. It was not a film of coersion - more of a deep loving friendship which turned to love for one another
3,Disappointed in recipes chosen for the book,"Purchased the book because of the promise of each chapter beginning with a recipe for one of the dishes from the movie. While technically this was true, I was disappointed in the recipes included in the book. Was expecting to have the recipes from the Big Feast - especially a recipe for the famous Timpano. It was glaringly missing as were recipes for just about all of the dishes served at the Big Night.On the plus side, since a book needs ""a lot more words"" than the visuals of a movie, there was much description of what was occuring while preparing the meal. Still, that did not make up for the lack of the recipes."
2,TIMPANO,"I have not read the book, however; the Timpano is in a cookbook by Tucci and Tropiano among others titled ""Cucina & Famigila"""
2,review of Big Night novel and recipes,"I was expecting more in the way of recipes with this book. Many of the wonderful dishes from the ""big night"" dinner were not in the book, including the spectacular Timpano. That was a disappointment. I would not recommend purchasing the book if you want to find recipes for the items in the movie dinner."
2,Tilts...,"We bought this because of its simplicity and accuracy as a gift for aging parents, but we had to return it when it tilted too readily when they tried to step on and off of it. The scale is simply too unstable for someone who might struggle with balance."
3,It's okay,I don't understand why home scales are so different from doctor scales. I can't really tell if this scale is accurate but it does give the reading very quickly.
2,Expected more,Kind of disapointed .The songs are not what I expected from an Elton John CD.This Christmas party may be my grandma and even her does not like it!
2,Elton John's Christmas Party,"Love the song ""Step Into Christmas"" and that is why I bought this. However, it is mainly hard rock - not traditional Christmas songs - and I got it initially because of the song by Elton John and it was one of Starbucks. However, not what I would normally by. Gave it to someone who loves Hard Rock and was happily received."
2,"U2's ""New Years Day"" = holiday song ?","U2's ""New Years Day"" = a holiday song ?I wouldn't bother except that the money goes to charity (hopefully)."
2,Boring Party,"This album has some good songs on it, but it has some weird choices for a Christmas album and doesn't seem to be very well thought out. I would prefer to have something else. Seems like someone took Sir Elton's name slapped it onto a package and put together whatever songs were easiest to get the rights to use."
4,Fun!,"My alto recorder students were not happy using the soprano recorder books I had. They loved having their own. There are only a few pictures that are very old fashioned. However, the fingering charts are traditional music were great. There are some duets to play with soprano recorders as well."
2,"Remedial Sales advice, not Insurance","I buy numerous sales techniques books, way too many as a matter of fact. I bought this book because as a beginning insurance sales agent, I thought it would give me some tips ABOUT INSURANCE SELLING. Not to be, this book is a very basic sales technique guide to selling ANYTHING. If you want basic sales guidance, buy ""The Accidental Salesperson"" or the Sandler Sales Institute book ""You Can't Learn to Ride a Bicycle...."".I bought this book through Amazon because I have never seen it in a bookstore. Do not waste your money on this book...my apologies to the author who undoubtedly could provide insurance related ideas but took a very remedial road with this book. If it is self-published, more power to the author, I wish I could get the guts to commit some of my sales thoughts in a book.Alan Erickson"
2,principles of principled life insurance selling,too basic. i would like a book revealing a total life insurance selling system. thank you.Frank X. Netter
3,NOT really unrated...,"I already bought this back in 2007 b/c I grew up watching the VHS version time after time. I was pleased as punch when this arrived in the mail & I promptly watched it. There are some inconsistencies from the original VHS. the DVD is missing blood spurts & some gore. Cutaways are used instead. I was looking through the reviews to see if anyone else had caught them, but did not see anything mentioned. I'm going to pick up the AmazonUK version to see if their version is closer to the one I remember from my younger days. Great little movie, though!"
3,What's wrong Brad Pitt?,"I heard Pitt tried to buy every copy of this film because he was ashamed of this film. I didn not really find anything wrong with this movie at all. The acting was very good for a B film and it probably would have been better if they upped the gore a little. The main problem was the kills in this movie were the worst in the history of horror films. Ive seen tons and tons of horror movies and I cant recall the kills being as bad as this film. Other then the kills, it was enjoyable and worth a look. I found it a brand new copy at a discount store for two bucks, so I got my moneys worth."
3,Witty little slasher flick.,"Made when Pitt was a kid and it shows. But the story is told with a tongue-in-cheek style that elevates it above the genre it represents by about half a degree. Martin Mull steals the show. But the young leads provide eye-candy and I enjoyed myself despite myself. This edition is an import with the English sound track pasted over the picture, or so it seems, but since there is no official release in the U.S. it will do. It is entertaining in it's own way and worth it to see Pitt begin his career inauspiciously."
3,I didnt like it as much as I thought I would...........,"I was expecting this movie to be much better, much more exciting, and surprising, especially since one of my favorite actresses, Jill Scholeon, who I met at work by the way, was in it. I found myself not enjoying the movie at all, and waiting for it to be over. I sat through it, thinking that during the end it would get better, but it never did. It was just too slow and boring with no surprises at all. I didnt enjoy it at all.........."
4,"Jill Schoelen Brad Pitt perfect beauties , crafty horror","I love cutting class. It's more comedy than straight forward horror but the finale of the film shows even a high school can be scary. Also this one has the original trampoline impalement, move over Eli Roth's Thanksgiving trailer. Not so bloody or scary, or even sexy, perfect introduction to young tweens who might be getting not scary movies. Jill by the way has never looked better, here playing school princess paula in a deadly love triangle."
3,What a HOT actor!!!!!,"This movie was a laugh 8 years ago and still is. I can't believe it is actually offered on video. It deserves at least 3 stars for its blood content, disturbed student cruelty and innocent girl on the run routine. But you know, playing a crazy killer makes Donovan Leitch look truly sexy and appealing. He's a better madman than model!!!!! Truly attractive....If your attracted to evil men this is the low budget horror film for you, oh yeah, I guess some bonus points go to Brad Pitt as well."
5,It's a hilarious horror movie!!,This movie (although a horror movie) is very funny! Brad Pitt was an exceptional actor (and always will be). His co-stars were just as good. And I give this movie two thumbs up!! :o)
5,You'll never cut class again!!,This movie is a hilarious horror set in a high school. Brian Woods(played by Donovan Leitch) is totally weird but at the same time sensitive and caring - he can be so decieving! Classic storyline and some of the scenes are a killer!! The comedy keeps coming and the murder scenes are original. A movie I could watch again and again. Has all the elements of an entertaining movie - it may be a bit tacky but hey thats what makes it so great!!
3,80's Old School Horror Fans Would Enjoy,"Omg, I haven't seen this movie in years! Yes, ladies and gents, that *is* Brad Pitt on the cover, but the cover tries to fool you. This isn't Brad Pitt's breakout roll, that was the hitchhiker in Thelma & Louise. But this movie may be one of his first films. He plays a minor character with one scene of his own.Cutting Class isn't a great classic like The Haunting or The Legend of Hell House. So why three stars instead of two? Because it was a favorite of mine, and anyone who enjoyed movies like Chopping Mall, Night of the Comet, Prom Night, or Return to Horror High, etc will find this movie to be an enjoyable addition to your collection!"
2,What was that???,"Kid comes back from a mental hospital, acting all creepy & hiding in places and watching this girl, following his old friends around. Her jealous boyfriend doesn't want him around her. Then deaths start to happen around the school and the creepy kid and the jealous boyfriend are the suspects. Who is the killer? Do we really care? Bad Dialogue, Bad Acting, Bad Story, No suspense and predictable ending. Jill Schoelen is the only good thing that makes this b-movie watchable, Even Brad Pitt can't save this movie.."
1,Cutting Class,"No wonder I've never heard of this movie, til I was surfing Brad Pitt...it certainly is ""B"" flick movie, and thank gosh his acting got better as he got older!! I am a big Brad Pitt fan, and he is definetly very young and cute in this movie, which is the only thing it has going for it!! I wish I would have rented this movie before buying it! I would not recommend this movie unless you are a serious Brad Pitt fan, and want it in your collection."
2,This One is the Pitts,"Typical slasher film is noteworthy if for no other reason that it boasts a typically charasmatic performance from a young Brad Pitt, doing his best 90210 impression. Jill Schoelen bounces around most of the movie looking cute and little more, but what can expect from the actress being molded as the 90's Queen of Scream (of course the horror movie bubble bursts before she could make much of a name for herself). Still there are a few unintentional laughs and the filmmaker's insipid, down-right ridiculous stance on the treatment of mental illness can be taken with a grain of salt given it comes in such a poor film, which can't possibly be taken seriously."
2,Not a very scary horror movie!,"To tell the truth, i did not find this horror flick scary at all, and did not find this very amusing. Rated M+15 in australia...my 10 yr old sister was laughing through the whole thing! Good cast though. I like Brad pitt and Roddy Mcdowall. The story: All about a guy from a mental hospital who kills a couple of people...and gets killed at the end."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible",This is not a good horror film. It's very very very boring. This movie is dry. I will not recommend this film to any one.
1,ridiculous thriller,"a cheesy slasher film with a lot of bad acting. Though I only gave it 1 in a half because of Brad Pitt, Roddy McDowell and Martin Mull's premise. Otherwise it's just a pile. Pitt in one of his first starring roles. It's too obvious who the real killer is, ths story thins after a while. Roddy McDowell as the principal with problems is very funny. Martin Mull talking to the dog to get help was funny also. But this doesnt make sense and it tries to but a bunch of otherthings fall in its lap and crumble it. In one scene Pitt is rehearsing Hamlet's To Be Or Not To Be speech, I had to do that same thing for Advanced Theatre, just that speech"
2,Great book...horrible ebook.,This is an excellent book that suffers from a horrible conversion to electronic format. The font is almost completely unreadable and unscalable as well. It is tragic how publishers charge almost as much as print and make no effort to ensure a quality product.
4,Good textbook.,The chapters are a reasonable length. The text is well written and has a definate voice. If you are a student this is a nicer size to carry than an enourmous biology book. The only annoying aspect is the first page of every chapter has the text alligned to the right. I loose my place for a few sentences. This is very minor though.
5,Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in America,Very good review of preservation in the United States. An easy read.
1,Don't buy this recording.,"Absolutely awful recording of a great opera.This CD is in mono and sounds like a member of the audience left their cassette recorder on. Several other ""good"" reviews refer to how all the words are ""intelligible"" and there are the usual ""shuffling of feet on stage"". What kind of recordings do these people usually buy?Buy this if you don't mind tossing your money in the garbage."
3,Pretty Weak,This is not one of Betina Krahn's best works. The hero is unpleasant and the plot fails to make sense or capture one's imagination.
5,"Unique, witty, and romantic","Honesty I did not think I was going to like this book but I decided to give it a try. I absolutely loved it. The plot was fresh and moved along at a perfect pace. The humor was a bonus and highlighted the hero and heroine's thoughts and motivations along with their building chemistry. I finished this book in one day which should tell you something about what a smooth and interesting read it was. I like Krahn's style (this was the first book of hers that I read) and intend to read more of them. If I had one little pet peeve it would be the extraordinary amount of detail included about things that didn't add to the story for me. Still, it shows the author did her research and I respect and appreciate that when reading a historical. The end of the book is satisfying and romantic."
3,Decent easy read...good way to past the time and relax!,The ending could be better but otherwise I thoroughly enjoy reading. It's a good way to relax after a hectic day a work.
3,Trilogy of Fantasy,"When I bought this album originally it had a green cover and it was entitled Trilogy of Fantasy Part One. I truly was expecting two more parts to this album which are never coming out at this point in time and it's very dissapointing as the music in this first installment was very good. The artist is not trying to create anything similar to LOTR he is actually creating his own story in music. The music is very relaxing but it ends leaving you with a desire for more, a desire to see how it all ends, and as I said before this will never happen which makes it a big dissapointment.If you like something different definitely get this album and enjoy the journey as it is relaxing, epic, enchanted, magical and eerie all at once."
4,I Know These People Well,"Years ago, a friend read this book, then immediately gave it to me because, she told me, I'm also an astrophysicist who once lived in Buffalo, NY. Those facts are irrelevant -- I would have loved this book in any event.Charles Baxter created the people in his book so exquisitely that I always feel I am there, traveling along in the story with them whenever I read it. I've never had such a close personal experiences with written characters.He defines and develops his people as they alternately live in their present, and in their receding pasts; his creativity results in characterizations that are very strong.I find myself unexpectedly writing this review after wanting to check if the book is still available; I'm not surprised to find that it is. And happily for me, as my copy is in pieces."
4,Hope,"One of Eudora Welty's most celebrated stories, The Optimist Daughter won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.This story is about a sweet old Judge and his family. His daughter Laurel McKelva Hand had left the south and returns. She rediscovers her roots and finds her own voice, finally feeling comfortable in her own skin.This story is sweet, caring and tells a tale that you can go home and make it be whatever you heart desires."
4,"Was Initially Pessimistic, But...","My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
2,Much ado about_______?,"I've always wanted to read a Welty book and I picked this one. Unfortunately, because now, I don't think I'll try another.Why must praise be heaped upon books that make you dig into them to uncover meanings that are obvious human truths? What Laurel(the title character) comes to realize at the end was plain to see at the beginning. Human beings are complex and may have motives that are different from what you assume or what yours would be in similar situations. Laurel knew her parents all her life and only after their deaths does she ""get"" this."
2,Thank goodness it was short,"I was just glad I was able to finish this novel in about an hour - while it isn't the worst I've ever read, it was overall dull and sort of pointless to my liking. I never really cared for enough of the characters to really connect to the book, and whenever there was a glimmer of amusement or cleverness, it passed as quickly as it had begun. I never mind literary vagueness, but most of the points in the story were just a tad *too* vague. That having been said, I will comment that the ending of the book did please me - I won't give it away for future readers, but what Laurel does with her life is an enormous relief; had she done otherwise I would probably have dashed the book against a wall!"
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"I picked up The Optimist's Daughter on advice of several recommendations. It is supposedly Welty's best work. Ha! This was certainly among the worst novels I have ever read. The language is poorly structured and she seems to go out of her way to dribble meaningless streams of words. I read it to the bitter end only in the hope that it somehow would get better....it didn't. If you want a great Southern writer I suggest Truman Capote in Other Voices, Other Rooms."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I was expecting more from this Pulitzer Prize-winning book.It tells the story of Laurel, who spends her father's last days at his bedside, together with his second wife, Fay. After his death, she and Fay go back to his home, each to react to the past and future in their own way.Some reviewers say this book is character rather than plot driven. And that's correct. But I never got a full sense of the characters. For example, I couldn't see either Laurel or Fay. I could only hear their voices and imagine their actions.This book is a great example of showing rather than telling. Readers induce the characters from their dialogue and reactions. But I found the dialogue to become long and tedious, the secondary characters confusing, and I longed for more description of the places and characters. I finished the book unsatisfied, longing for something more."
4,A concise and evocative novella,This is a very tightly written story (almost a novella) about a daughter's coping with the death of her father. The plot involves an obnoxious second wife. There is plenty of good dialog and evocative writing about the South.
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to read this book because the writing style of one of my favorite authors (Fred Chappell) was compared to that of Eudora Welty. My expectations, therefore, were high and I felt disappointed and wholly unsatisfied when I finished reading it. Perhaps this is due to some failing or intellectual lacking of my own (after all, the book DID win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction) but I found her characters to be rather flat and her attempts at abstract descriptions difficult to follow. If I had reread certain passages a few times, I might have been able to follow her train of thought but I read fiction for pleasure, not to practice my study skills. Throughout the entire book, I got the feeling that she was simply trying too hard to be poetic. While her writing must appeal to others, I, most likely, will not pick up another one of her books in the future."
1,A phone book of characters in an inane novel,"This book cannot be read without, to quote Peter Medawar, ""a desperate gasping and flailing around for sense."" Although it starts off promisingly enough, this book quickly degenerates into semi-philosophical musings and one-dimensional characters. To make things worse, the reader is expected to keep track of a multitude of minor characters who crawl over and mess up everything, like ants at a picnic. Save your money and read the white pages instead."
3,good story,read this for my Classics book club - read it in one afternoon but 2 days later could barely remember what it was about - had to look it over again - ok story -
4,A Beautiful Book,"This is a beautiful book about relationships, the past, and the present. Welty's language is moving while the story she builds is so wonderfully simple that it allows a reader to focus on the subtleties of character and language."
3,Optimist's Daughter is very zen,"The father lived loud and proud, but died with a whimper not a bang, that is pretty sad. The daughter was a wimp, but she became assertive. Redemption is always a rewarding end to a story. The (2nd wife/ step-mother) was the only consistent character throughout; loud and abrasive from beginning to end. The kind you love to hate. I liked this short story turned novel, I would recommend reading it. Especially after reading a big thick book. This one is short and sweet and cleans your reading palette just perfectly."
3,Other Aspects of the South,"This is a book by Eudora Welty.Ms. Welty was what you would call a great ""Southern"" writer. Even though I am a southerner myself, such authors are not often favorites of mine - often too slow, wordy and tragic for me.Anyway, I thought this book by Ms. Welty was OK. It had some interesting subplots, characters and settings, but it seemed to end rather abruptly and not say as much as it seemed to have the capacity to say. I gather she liked the short story, so maybe this was just her way - this was a very short novel. I think that the title may be a bit ironic too.In addition to some great handling of local color, the book offers a view of the South in a transitional time of recent years, but it concentrates on issues other than race. That might make it of interest especially to people from outside the region; the South is about more than just racial issues (among the magnolias).For some reason, people hate this review. Well, to each his/her own."
3,"Adddirondack Sisal Area Rub, chocolate","The rug seems well made and looks nice, but it was not what I expected or wanted. The border is a dark chocolate brown that is much darker than it appears in the photo. The weave is large with a pronounced pattern of gold, dark brown and beige."
1,This product did not work,I bought this product from Amazon. Product did not work and I have spent hours trying to get it working. Don't buy it.
2,Product was defective,"The switch & remote were within 10 feet of each other (maximum range said to be 50'). They were even in line of sight. It worked marginally the day I installed it (requiring me to hold the remote switch for 2 seconds to get it to work). Went on vacation & came back a week later, and it failed to work entirely. I changed the batteries, re-adjusted the antennae, and went through trouble shooting with the company, but the unit was deemed defective. I returned it for a refund. Other reviews said it did not work reliably, so I never purchased a new one."
1,Installation nightmare,The swith fits too tightly into a standard wall mount box. I had to file the box down to get it in. Unfortunately the box was so tight that the antena wire got caught between the switch an the box. It shorted out and destroyed the switch. I now have a $27 hunk of plastic. Don't try to mount this in remodel box. In fact I would not mount it in any metal box as the metal acts like a shield for the signal from the transmitter.
2,Light Switch,I have had nothing but problems with this since I bought it.I installed it as shown in the instruction and it did not work.after rereading the insturction and reinstalling it it still did not workI took it to my shop and was testing it when I noticed a very very small switch that turned the unit off and on. There was no mention of this switch in the instruction at all. Of course it came turned off.I reinstalled the switch and it worked great except with flousant lights they flicker very fast so could not use the floursant light bulbs. Also the unit when on interfers with every radio in the house. It is now not working again and not sure why. This only worked for 2 weeks.
4,"Works as advertised, but would prefer standard rocker switch.","Don't care for the decora style switch. Since everything else in the house is rocker, I still fumble to turn this one on, even after several months. However, it is better than rewiring. Interferes with DSL internet connection when light is on!"
3,OK for the purpose,"Does the job, better than running a wire in my situation but also not 100% reliable. Turns on due to interference often. (my hardwire half is in a 3 gang with 2 other swithces on the same circuit the other switches activate the remote often..)Will do some x10 stuff next time..."
1,Leviton Wireless Switch,We purchased this wireless switch because we do not have access to the wires in the old plaster walls upstairs. It did not work. We sent it back and tried a Heath Zenith. It worked right away and is still working.
3,Cannot be used for CFL,This product works but cannot be used with Fluorescent bulbs as the switch works as a dimmer till the light turns off.Most Fluorescent bulbs cannot be dimmed.It is unfortunate because I purchased this one specifically thinking it did not dim the lights like other models listed.
2,New design MUCH better,"I ordered 2 of these.After installation, I found one of the remote switches not working. I returned it to Amazon and they sent me a replacement.The replacement's remote switch uses 4 AAA batteries as opposes to the 2 that the broken one and the 2nd one from my original order.After a few days, the other original switch stopped working. Amazon is sending me a replacement unit. I'm just hoping it's the new design that uses more batteries.I truly believe that the transmitter using 2 batteries is just not powerful enough.I'm keeping everything crossed that the 2nd replacement unit is to 4 battery version. That one seems to be working perfectly."
3,Works but not for long,"Unit was satisfactory in all respects but failed after 3 years of light [bad pun] use, in a dressing closet."
3,Surface mount - beware of picutre.,"When I saw the packaging I was suspicious that the remote switch was SURFACE mount! Unfortunately I had to open the package to see for sure and turns out I was right. It looks like a wall switch but sticks out about 1/2"", not what I wanted. I was hoping you could cut a whole and install the remote switch so it would look like a real switch. Nope. Cant comment on how it works because I won't be using it, I will be running wires and installing an actual switch the right way. If your looking for convenience and it will be in a place where people won't see it then it might work well for you. They really should show an picture of the actual unit and warn the person before they buy it."
2,Warning! This is not compatible with fluorescent lights!,"There were no mentions of this on the web site description, but this product is for Incandescent ONLY.I found it out the hard way when the fluorescent light flicker badly after I install it.Other than that...PROS:- Great idea if for incandescent application. Easy way to add a 3 way switch without rewiring.- Reasonable priceCONS:- Not compatible with fluorescent- The switches (both on the receiver & the transmitter) does not have a good feel. You have to apply a bit of pressure and it doesn't not ""click"" or give any kind of mechanical feel.- The receiver (the part that goes into the wall replacing the original light switch) is really big and pretty much occupies the entire opening of the metal box in the wall. So, it is tricky if you have other wires in there. I also had to enlarge the dry wall opening a bit so that this can go in.- Takes 4 AAA batteries!"
3,Works but doesn't work...,"I had to return my unit because it will not work with my application. My bathroom light is tied to my bathroom fan and apparently the fan/light combo draws too many watts for this unit to handle. It is rated at 300 watts but from my test it won't give you all 300. When I did disconnect the fan just to see how it would work it worked perfectly and solves my problem of putting the switch on the inside of the bathroom as not to disturb the other person sleeping. The wall unit is kind of bulky, won't look great but not awful. They should make a recess kit for it. I will recommend this unit, it works for most applications and solves a huge problem and is a great value. I'm now looking a lutron PICO unit instead."
3,Incandescent only,"I bought this on the recommendation of another who seemed really happy with it. I have not used it. I returned it as the package made it clear it was for incandescent lights only and our application was fluorescent. The 3 stars are not for the product as much as they are for the description at Amazon which did not, IMO, make it clear it was incandescent only. The good news is that returning a product in a situation like this is very convenient with Amazon. 5 stars for the return process!"
3,NEEDS MORE SENSITIVITY,"The switch works very well, even with fluorescent lights; HOWEVER, the range of the remote unit is EXTREMELY limited. I had to add additional wire to the antenna on the base unit in order to allow the remote unit to work from only 10 feet away! Suggest that the manufacturer improve the antenna in the remote switch and do some serious R&D; on improving the range of the unit.H K Atwood"
5,Works perfectly as described.,"I installed this kit in an entry room where the light switch was clear across from the front door. It works perfectly with zero interference. A slimmer remote switch would have been nicer, but that would have meant some kind of watch batteries vs. the 4 AAA batteries it uses (which are easily replaceable). I wanted to buy a kit from a reputable company vs. ""as seen on tv"" junk. What more is there to say, buy it, it works."
1,Never worked,"I have had this product for almost two years and it has never worked consistently. In fact, I just keep the lights on now because the remote doesn't do anything. I have tried it on both channels, with both incandescent and flourescant bulbs, with new batteries, and nothing works."
4,Nice Switch,"This switch works well if used with incandescent lighting. The ability to dim the light is also a nice feature. It would be nice if the switch worked with fluorescent lights, but I have yet to find a wireless 3-way that does."
3,"Useful, but with limitations","I have installed it in a basement to control compact fluorescent lights. The lights started flickering, but I solved the problem by adding a regular incandescent bulb in the circuit. I found that it works even if the incandescent lamp is very low power (I used a 5W bulb from my Christmas ligths). The antenna wire has to be away from the metal box, otherwise the range is very limited. Overall I'm not impressed."
1,Please Don't Buy this Product,"Got one of these; didn't work. Got another; didn't work. Searched several non-Amazon sites and found a Heath-Zenith unit that, after I re-researched the Amazon site, found it buried in its bowls. Obtained this product (from Amazon), installed it and it works GREAT! The unit is Heath-Zenith SL-6133; why Amazon doesn't have this on its primary search venue is beyond me and disingenious. Yo! Amazon...save your clients the trouble and yourself the return shipping fees; put Heath-Zenith SL-6133 on your primary site and delete Levitron."
1,Works Poorly,"Remote switch often fails to turn circuit on (may be related to fluorescent lighting, but fails even if I place an incandescent light in the ceiling set). I know the signal reaches the base unit, because the remote unit will always turn the circuit off once the base unit is used to turn the circuit on. Bottom line--poor design, would not recommend."
3,"Fine product, do not use with fluorescents.","Fine enough product but does not work with fluorescent bulbs at all. Do not try to use. Hard to find a product that can do this with fluorescents. Swith is large, make sure you have room in the gang box. I'm sure it would work fine with incadescents but doesn't really work with ""going green"" CFL's or any other fluorescent bulbs."
1,Defective product,"I bought this switch inspite of negative feedback because I wanted the rocker style to go with the other switches in my house. I installed the switch and got it to work. It worked (most of the time) for two days and quit. I checked the connections and the were solid. I have returned the switch to Amazon. Please save yourself the grief, don't buy this product"
1,Absolute Garbage,"I have gone through two of these--the first one, which didn't work at all, was replaced by Leviton. The second one worked for a month or two and then stopped. Leviton is refusing to do anything, despite repeated calls. The company simply does not stand by its products. I've been told to buy the much more expensive (by 4 times) product the company now sells, as it is ""much better."" Meanwhile, I'm stuck with this lemon. Do NOT buy."
3,"Works, but not evertime",I installed this switch about 12 feet apart and it works most of the time. About 2% of the uses fail.
2,Be aware as listing does not mention this is a Dimmer,This will not work with LED or florescent lights due to the built in Dimmer which isn't mentioned in this listing.
4,remote lightswitch,"Had to send first one back, didn't work. Replacement now installed and working. Easy to install, uses two AA batteries. Has dimming ability. Original one that was being replaced after 10+ years had 4 batteries and unable to dim. Overall very satisfied."
4,Okay,I bought one a year ago and it quit working after 6 months. I bought another and it has been working fine. I have and normal rocker switch that has worked for three + years.
5,A foundation for change,"Prof. Hamilton's work on apprenticeship is based on modifying the centuries-old German apprenticeship program to the different culture of the US and Canada. This important work was picked up on early on by Bill Clinton, then Governer of Arkansas (the book jacket has a quote from Bill!), and was largely responsible for the School to Work Transitions Act. Necessary reading for anyone who is interested in a way to make education more meaningful for the majority of our high school students."
3,When Jessie Came Across the Sea,"We like the book because Jessie was succesful in NYCand she saved up her money,so her grandmother couldcome over to see her get married.The book was OKAY!"
2,"John's, Glenn's, Adam's, & Shane's review",It was a confusing book. It was an O.K. book. It was very touching at the end. I liked the part when Jessie helped the people on the boat.
5,Great Book to Read to 7-8 Year Olds Learning about World,"My son really enjoyed this story of a young orphaned girl ""chosen"" (to her dismay) to leave her country and go to America by herself, leaving behind her grandmother. The pictures are excellent, and the story moves quickly. The story provoked frequent questions by my son such as: ""Why did Jessie have to leave her homeland and her grandmother?"" and ""Why did the villagers think going to America was such a good thing?"" Because Jessie was a child, my son identified with her. A beautiful story."
4,Godd book to learn English,"The book is great and my teacher recommended, The price is good but the only thing it was that I had to erased every answer. Thanks God the previous owner wrote it with a pencil."
2,Complex,I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science so consider myself an educated person. I would like a little more explanation on the wiring diagrams.
2,I thought the information in this book was lacking.,I did not feel this book gave adequate information consistent with the title.
2,very limited,I would not recommend this book - it only has a few plans and is not much help in deciding on a layout design.
3,The Rocking Horse Winner,"The Rocking Horse Winner is a deliteful short story written by D.H. Lawrence. The story is about a young man named Paul struggling for the attention of his mother. He feels he can accomplish this by riding and riding his rocking horse. With under-lying sexual tones and a unique twist on the story of Edipius, this short story makes for good reading at the highschool and college level."
2,strange,This is a fantasy movie about a Hollywood moviemaker who falls in love with a woman from a TV Soap who magically appears from his TV.The move starts very slowly and confusing. The beginning and the ending were annoying.The most pleasant thing about the movie was the performance from the actress Kimberly Oja.
3,tiny but good craftsmanship,"The gears are miniscule but have been machined well. If you genuinely want to work on a watch or clock - this is your item, but if you're looking for steam-punk gears you will be very disappointed."
5,Really good book,Gives you lots of different examples when explaning making sure that you understand from at least one angle.
2,More polemic than history,"Price-Jones seems less interested in telling the history of the demise of the USSR than he is in attacking the left. He spends the first chunk of the book talking about how evil communism was, which is not debatable. However, Price-Jones' target is not the Soviets; it's Western liberals who did not share his views on confrontation with them. The author attacks those who tried to promote coexistence as unwitting stooges or active collaborators with the Soviet regime. That's not the kind of book I expected from the title. I kept reading, waiting for the history to start, but I gave up after more than 80 pages of Price-Jones' ranting."
4,Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History (5th Edition) - Review,Boght this for my nephew as it was an assignment in school - i had a read too and enjoyed it very much
4,Useful Tool,This book was chosen by my professor for our German History class. An easy read and very informative. There are great pictures and quotations. I would recommend it for a class or history buff that wanted a good read.
3,Typos,"Fun read, even as a 33 yr old. My only complaint is, there are A LOT of typos. Still totally readable, but the errors are very noticeable."
3,Well written but a little confusing in spots.,I thought this book was good but when I read it for the Stettler Elem. Book Club I had to take time to read it and really understand it. It a really interesting and exciting.
3,Story Student,"The Borrowers is a really good book. Borrowers are little people who live in the bottom of peoples houses and borrow their things. There is a family called the Clocks. There are worried and lonely for other Borrowers! Are there any borrowers left in the world? On day they go out, and they try to find any other Borrowers. Then they run into a cat! The cat grabs Mrs. Clock, and I recommend this book for all its joy and charm, and the author wrote this book for the short people of the world."
5,A wonderful story to share with a child!,"I am 24 years old, and I cannot count the number of times I have read this book (and the sequels). It is my second favorite book of all time (next to Gone With the Wind) and I think it is superb! Mary Norton makes the characters very believable through her accurate descriptions of how things must look to the Borrower family. I cried at the end of this book because I did not want it to end...imagine my delight when I discovered the sequels!!!! I went to the new Borrowers movie a few weeks ago, DO NOT go see it if you are a true Borrowers fan, it was NOT the same storyline AT ALL! Just a warning. I was disappointed. READ THIS BOOK, YOU WILL LOVE IT. I re-read it every single summer!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The Borrowers are tiny little guys, but otherwise people. They get along by using junk that is lying around and adapting it for their own use. This book is about what happens when a human boy actually discovers them, after moving into their area.Not a particularly uncommon theme, and this one is pretty dull."
4,Classic kids story marred by several typos,"Mary Norton's ""The Borrowers"" is just as much fun as I remember from reading it 40 years ago. Maybe even more, since there are a few jokes there that might go over the head of a 10-year old. The Kindle edition had several annoying typos, but nothing that prevented you from understanding the story. Unfortunately, the Kindle (or at least, my Kindle) can't display the illustrations that spread across two pages, like the one of the Borrowers in their sitting room early in the story."
3,Pleasant but puzzling,"After owning this book for 40 years, I finally read it. I blazed through it, wanting to find out how it ends and what the truth was. Disappointing as it was left up to the reader what to believe. Was a very accurate peek into Victorian England, but in the view of miniature people who live inside the walls of old homes. As someone who knows the differences in words/languages, was easy to read, but may not be for others who don't. Love the story idea. Very similar to another series called ""The Littles."""
3,A great book but confusing in the first chapters.,I thought this book was a great book and I enjoyed it. Me and my friends read it for a Book Club in Stettler. When I first started it I did not understand what they were talking about.
2,depressing,"I never found this story to be a fun read. It was given out as a reward for good test grades in my grammar school. It is about a miniature (1:12) family in hiding, living in constant worry and fear and under siege. Their lives are essentially subsistence living and in survival mode. I only liked the chestnut they ate for tea. I preferred Stuart Little. There just didn't seem to be anything nice or happy about this story. The writing is very good especially in evoking the sadness of being broke, not having enough money which I think is a frequent theme in English books and films."
5,My son wanted this book.,My son is an advid book reader and wanted this book in his collection. He is enjoying it tremendously!
4,Awesome book!,"This is a really good book! I highly recomend it, it has a slow start in my opion but once I got into it I could not put it down. This book is fun and exciting for any age group."
2,Spend a little more for the LED version,Mag lights are the standard for all flashlights but spend a litle more for the Mag-Lite ST3D016 3-D Cell LED Flashlight. I own both. They have the same brigtness and focus but the extended battery and bulb life of the LED more than makes up for the price difference. Go green!
3,Not so much about coaching...,"I've got this book hoping that I can get some coaching specific advice for running my coaching practice. I was disappointed to see that actually only three chapters are clearly specific to coaching and that the rest of the information presented (how to manage your work space, your promotion activities, your accounting challenges, etc.) can be found in many other (and better) books about self employment an and running your own business.The book seems like it has many parts writen by people outside the coaching profession and noone cared enough to make them much more specific to coaches...Also note that some information is UK specific, like Chapter 9 (""Other financial matters"")."
1,"Great bag, WORTHLESS Company.","Company cancelled my original order for 5 packs saying the item was discontinued, but reposted the pack the same day at a much elevated price. Discontinued? Then they tell me that they are sorry for the inconvenience, but do not offer any solution to the problem. OPTICSALE....probably better off sending someone Western Union over Craigslist."
3,Very Good Overview,"This is a concise and well written introduction to the history and historiography of the 1st World War. Joll does an excellent job of reviewing the opening of the war and the background of the European diplomatic system. He then presents a series of critical chapters reviewing the some of the proposed causes of the war including imperial rivalries, capitalist competition, and domestic political needs. Joll is judicious and evenhanded in his analysis and leaves readers with the conclusion that there was not one or even a few causes of the war. Instead, readers gain a clear picture of the complexities and instability of European society prior to the war."
1,a path to nowhere,"the authors make a very profound review of all the political ,economic and social facts active in Europe in 1914 ,But the very disappointing fact is that in the final chapter under the pompous name of Conclusion they conclude nothing at all!!."
3,Dry but informative,"Short, very short, look at the First World War. Overly dry and academic, even for a scholarly contribution. Too many other books out there to waste time on this one."
4,good boot,"last year bought the same boot, but with a 5in top. did something dumb with a friend and hurt ankel. got the higher boot for support. so far i love the boot. it fit tights, and helps take the pain out of my feet. work in car oil and grease all day. will buy again when the time comes. hope it last a year like the last one."
3,"nice, but...","sturdy, lighter then herman survivors, but the cushion is a bit hard if you want to stand all day long. they are of good construction so far.no obvious flaws."
1,Hard to Read Dial,"If you notice in the picture of this scale, the individual pound markings are hard to see. That is exactly how it is in real life. Because the lines are almost the same length, it is almost impossible to distinguish whether the reading is at, for example, 107 lbs., 107.5 lbs. or 108 lbs. My glasses prescription gives me better than 20/20 vision and I can't see if I have lost or gained a pound with this scale."
1,Very volatile....not accurate at all,This was the worst bathroom scale ever. The weight gauge can swing 5-10lbs in either direction by just stepping on and off the scale in succession. We sent it back and opted for a digital scale.
3,a nice handy scale,I bought the scale soley for the plastic knobs attached. It aids one in following the direction of the weight.
1,loaded with bad advice,"I almost don't even know where to start with this book. It is just loaded with bad advice, such as not squatting below parallel, (squatting parallel which they recommend is bad for the knees due to torque). They also recommend useless exercises such as curls. Completely leave out one of the best exercises you can do: the deadlift. They include machines which are completely or near useless, some of which are actually dangerous. Such as the back extension machine which is notorious for blowing out discs in your spine. I think this book should be renamed Weight Training written by Idiots. Honestly though, you can find much better information on the internet and for free."
5,Very well planned and complete.,"This book is more than meet's the eye. It has muscle diagrams for each exercise in the book so you can see exactly which muscle you're targeting. For instance, some exercises only target the middle deltoids, while others work on the rear or front.Also, this book takes a more scientific approach to weight lifting instead of just repeating common sense and personal intuition of some olympic weight lifter. For example, it says that contrary to popular belief, multiple scientific studies have shown that just doing one set of an exercise is just as effective as wasting hours at the gym doing 5 or 10 sets like some guys do. Doing 1 set is MUCH more efficient than doing 5 or 10. Especially for beginners.This is the only weight training book you will need: A+"
5,Awesome book in great condition!!!,This was an awesome book in great condition!!! Irt really helps beginners to understand the basic knowledge they need for weight lifting.
2,Only the first 100 pages are useful to U.S. recruiters,"The book offers an introduction to recruiting, with some good suggestions. However, more than half of the book deals with international recruiting and is therefore not that useful for recruiters dealing mainly with the U.S."
1,do not purchase if you have the ipod touch,"I purchased this product last week because a few people i know have used this and said it is the best fm transmitter for the ipod. 5 minutes after it came in i went to my truck to hook up my ipod, there was nothing. I am not sure why, but the radio station will not appear on the ipod touch screen and will not allow you to know what station you are tuned into to set your radio to. On monster's website ( as of 12/3/07) this is the first product listed on the page for touch accessories. After waiting on hold for over 30 minutes to talk to a tech support rep. from monster, i found out that the page on www.monstercable.com was wrong and that if you have a ipod touch, you should not buy this. Monster agreed to send me the correct one in exchange for this one. The one that is being sent to me is the Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus."
1,"Good design, poor performance","The auto scan feature invariably stops on a band with interference, while I have no problem finding one manually. The sound quality is disappointing (and yes I have a decent stereo in the vehicle) it sounds almost muffled; I still much prefer playing a CD. This is the second monster transmitter that I have found disappointing. It may be that all FM transmitters suffer from poor sound quality, but a few years ago in a previous vehicle the CD player that transmitted in this manner had no such problems. Very disappointing for the money."
2,Could be better,Does not charge the ipod at the same time. Description did not state this. Auto scan is convenient but uses up only charge port in the car. Seller also was not very responsive.
3,"Great product, but....","While the benefits sited in the other reviews I agree with, here are 2 showstoppers for me.When power is applied it automatically starts playing. I like control, and I hate devices that assume what it is I want.But the really rotten issue is, for most iPod mounts, like my belkin tunedok and Nyko Universal Car Mount you will need a sendstation dock at about $30 to extend the connector past the dock slot. Some designer was not thinking!Finally, when you shut off your engine, it keeps playing - unlike the iCarPlay Plus , which stops the play. If you are gone for too long, your ipod battery will be dead.Look at the Monster iCarPlay Plus instead."
4,Stationary Transmitter is the key,I tried several other types of transmitter units for my Ipod and this is by far the best. The stationary unit that plugs into the lighter works better than the Belkin where the transmitter is down the line and is apt to pick up other signals through the wire. Now I can move my Ipod and it doesn't affect the signal. Plus now the transmitter is located very near the radio and it picks up the signal much better with less interferance.Not perfect but as good as I can get without a direct plug into the radio.
2,Have had better transmitters for the iPod,"We used this Monster product for a year or so after a prior FM transmitter for our iPod died. We found the sound quality okay, as good as any other transmitter-type FM/iPod product - but it was difficult to find a station we could stay on for more than a few minutes, and switching stations was a pain. We had a cheaper product than this before that we liked better - we could read the display better, there was FAR less static and we didn't have to switch so often. We do live in an urban area and that may explain some of our problems. But we finally decided to give up on this one and try another one. It's just too much of a pain in the neck to use."
4,Works how it should,"The iCarPlay works how it should, but be WARNED that it doesn't work on the OLDER iPods.I am able to listen to my iPod while I drive my car and the static background from the radio is kept at a minimum.The AUTOSCAN feature is easy to use and saves you the headache of finding the ""best"" station."
3,Would probably work a lot better outside of the city,"I bought this product for my wife. In her old car she used to be able to play her iPod through a cassette adaptor. Her new car did not have a cassette adaptor so we got the Monster icar play. Problem is we live in NYC and almost all of the FM frequencies are in use. Even if you find a frequency that is clear, say in Brooklyn, when you drive into the Bronx it will be tied up so you are constantly trying to adjust frequencies. Now she just listens to the radio. Thank goodness my car is hard wired for the ipod :-)"
2,First hand experience.,"First of all I don't see any reason why you could not ship this item to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a territory of the USA and if you can ship a book you can ship this type of merchandise. It is not nuclear material is just a transmitter.The thing failed in four hours of use. I had to open it to make it work again, still with difficulty. After that it has been working as I expected."
4,Monster iCarPlay,"Easy to use, but some times the quality of the sound is not the best.The power light distracts me when driving at night.Generally, good product, fair price."
1,iCarPlay,"This did not work in the 5-6 ipods i tried. the one it did, it had lots of static and did not function very well."
1,not happy,product doesn't work wel. we couldn't find one station that would have clear signal. we're very disappointed and wasted our money. perhaps this product might work well for people who live out in the unpopulated area with not too many radio stations.
2,"Not a surprise, not appropriate for a city","2 Stars -- I'm sure this FM transmitter works somewhat okay if you are in a rural area or small town where there are only a few radio stations available. But unfortunately, this product performs very poorly in the city, which should not be a surprise. When I finally found a frequency that had no interference from radio stations, the sound quality was entirely unacceptable, even coming through my car's high-end sound system. I recommend either burning MP3s to CD or having your MP3 player professionally installed in your car. Skip any FM Transmitters if you care at all about the quality of the sound.5 Stars -- To Amazon for giving me a full refund on this item!"
1,terrible experience,"I bought this item expecting it to work for my ipod touch. Of course it did not. The packaging was in some japanese/chinese language therefore i couldnt even read the directions on how to use it. After contacting the seller, he/she didnt even acknowledge the problem and blew me off. Worst purchase in my life...stay away from this seller!"
1,What a disappointment! Don't Buy!,"This transmitter does have good sound but it's flaw is fatal. Everytime the signal is weak or lost it cuts off with a loud ear-piercing static sound requiring you to physically disconnect the transmitter from the iPod and reconnect it. It's an absolute nightmare. My old transmitter would simply get staticy when the signal was lost or weak and you could try picking one of the other presets - not this horrible device. This one requires you, while driving, to disconnect and reconnect to get it to play again. It's simply a nightmare. 5 times in one hour this happened yesterday. Most of us listen to music while driving to calm down and relax; this little terror device could make you get into an accident. My old transmitter by Aerielle finally died but it was perfect and simple to use. This one is, like I said, a nightmare. If I could give it no stars I would"
1,dislike,"I do not reccommend this product. It rarely works and when it does, the connection is awful. If i move my ipod or the wire at all, the connection is lost. Seeing as I bought the product brand new, there shouldn't be any issues."
3,works great with older ipods,"This item works great with my daughters older ipod video but does not work correctly with my newer 160 gig classic. With the classic, it plays only the music. The vocals do not come through. The problem is not with my ipod, as I have taken it to the apple store and had it checked out. My ipod plays fine in docking stations and through my headphones it just does not want to work with this FM Transmitter. The FM Transmitter does work with my daughters ipod so the problem must be a compatability issue. The wierd thing is I have had one of these Monster FM Transmitters before and it worked just fine with my ipod. However this new one does not. How wierd is that? Up until this problem happened I would have given the transmitter a 5 star rating as my old one worked great and lasted a decent amount of time."
5,Got an iPod? Then you have to buy this!,"I purchased this after buying a less expensive FM transmitter which worked once in a blue moon. The price difference is definitely worth it. If you have an older car and/or can't get a factory-installed system with an AUX jack (and even if you can), this device is definitely worth purchasing. Manufactured by Monster, able to be ported to different vehicles, awesome sound quality -- hey, how can you go wrong?"
1,Did not work at all,"I tried this with both 2nd and 3rd gen nanos. The 2nd gen one would continuously attempt to tune on it's own. It would occasionally stop on an even tenth of a MHz which was completely useless as here in the US we use odd tenth MHz intervals. I tried to see if it was on the wrong region selection but the unit I had also had issues with scrolling through menus on it's own.With the 3rd gen it would only display the currently tuned station. I got an open box unit, so I don't know if this unit was already broken. I just returned the unit for a refund."
2,"Finally, the scan feature I've been waiting for... wait, it doesn't really work...","Good signal output as far as these things go. The scan feature would be phenomenal if it didn't take 120 seconds to scan and then pick a less than optimal channel. Scanning on your own while driving is dangerous, but this thing didn't solve that problem for me. It's almost there, keep trying Monster.Even though I only gave it 2 stars, it's still perhaps the best transmitter on the market as of Aug. 2007:-("
4,"Great Product, Great Price","Works great in my car and was 35$ cheaper than off of the Monster Cable website. However, my car's reception on it is a bit fuzzy when I put my iPod in the console between the seats. It works great when I place it on top of my dashboard. Also, I received it about 5 days sooner than the earliest expected date of delivery."
4,Finally a FM Transmitter that works,"I like the fact the frequency can be changed using the ipod display.Yes there can be static during playback, but that is due to using an already occupied frequencies.I found I got the best results when I changed the region to Japan and used used 88.1.I would definitely recommend it, I have used 2 other transmitters and this looks like the final one.Hope that helps."
2,Poor reception,I bought this at CompUSA. I live in rural Vermont. The AutoSearch works fairly well. The static when connected is acceptable. A big problem is that suddenly you'll get blasted by static when the FM signal is interfered with. I'm bringing it back for refund. I agree with the previous reviewer - it's NOT worth it. My wife's old 8 station Monster works much better.I'm going to try going back to my old Belkin charge which connects to a cassette.
1,Returned after 1 week,"I ended up returning this after a week. The auto-scan never seemed to work right, and the reception had a lot of static."
2,Not Thrilled,"I wasn't thrilled with the Monster Ipod transmitter at all. Actually I returned it to Amazon and am awaiting their judgment on my return. I did n't like it because there was too much static, breaking up of transmission. I live in not so crowded area but do have hills, ocean, and mountains around. Nevertheless, I thought it was much trouble to operate and the clarity of the music was surely lacking."
5,Great Product,"Does go out from time to time, but that's mainly due to the fact I live in LA and there are no free radio stations anymore. Great deal!"
2,Not for use in a Prius,"This item seems to work fine in a vehicle where the antenna is near the device. HOWEVER, it does not work in a hybrid. I have a Prius and Civic Hybrid and the device overheated in both cars."
5,Works like a champ!,"The auto-search really helps out in big cities, like the Houston area where I live. On road trips I had absolutely no problems with channel bleed-over. Of course, with a saturated dial, some distortion may still creep in. However, this is the best product I have used so far to play your iPod through the stereo and charge the unit at the same time. The cable is long enough to be able to hold the iPod close to you to be able to change/locate songs, which was a major dilemma w/ my previous stationary cigarette light based unit. All in all, this is the best product on the market in my opinon, well worth the extra cost of the unit."
5,Monster iCarPlay is great!,"Already had an earlier version which worked well, but this is even better. Easy to change stations. Great having station display on the iPod. Strong signal. Keeps it station setting even after being disconnected from power for days.I ahve had Griffin and Sony adapter/FM transmitters before and this is the best yet."
1,AutoScan just doesn't work,"The AutoScan feature seemed like a good idea but I have tried it repeatedly following exactly the instructions on the product, but after selecting ""Auto"" nothing at all happens. Yes, it says to wait, but you can wait and wait and wait and nothing at all happens. It works in manual station mode but you don't need to pay this much for that technology. This one is going back where it came from. Oh and BTW it's not wireless (the FM transmission is wireless but the transmitter is on a wire so it's not wireless)."
2,Bummed out about this transmitter,"We bought this transmitter for close to $100 after trying out a cheap Belkin model that didn't work well. We thought that you get what you pay for, so it was time to pony up. I'll agree with other negative reviews about the reception being bad, and since I'm usually using this when traveling across the state, it would be nice if the change-station function was more user friendly. But worst of all for me is that I now have an iTouch, which will not display the station on the screen. It still works, but changing stations on the transmitter and making sure the radio correlates is close to impossible."
1,"Not wireless, didn't charge, not for my iPod!","I bought this thinking that I could use my 2nd generation iPod touch with this in my car....WRONG!!! It doesn't charge, it's not wireless, and it won't work with my style of iPod! I'm going to try and return it. But in all fairness, the description does say that it will only work with the classic iPods, you just have to look carefully to find it. And trying to return it there's a 15% re-stocking fee, they won't pay for shipping, and I won't be buying from this company/brand again."
2,"For the $$ you'd think it'd be almost perfect, but it's not even close.","I got this as a gift last year for my Ipod Classic Video 30GB so I'm so relieved that I didn't waste my own $100. I live in the metro nyc area and would love to use this everyday but it's not worth the headache.This only has 3 buttons, so why is it so hard to use!!! The autoscan takes minutes, not seconds, to go thru the entire radio network and ends up picking the same 3 stations all the time. When I press the main button sometimes it scans, sometimes it picks a station, and sometimes it just does nothing. During songs, I hear blasts of static. Sometimes the Monster turns off and then then I'm listening to the radio station. I also need to hold the ipod up by the steering wheel while I'm driving otherwise it gets even worse reception. I know my cheap new corolla's radio is partially to blame but the Monster cable should work well enough to make listening to my ipod in the car a pleasant experience but it doesnt."
4,great product,"this is a great item, especially for the traveler. the sound quality is great, and the auto-scan feature is incredibly useful. would highly recommend."
4,Wireless ipod tranmitter,Generally a very good device. It does fade in and out dpeending on recpetion areas. Very easy to install and use. Simple directions.
5,Great Performance,"The ICarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter does work as advertized. Very simple to use, just follow the directions. I had similar products in the past that used FM stations, but none come close to the strong signal broadcast of thie iCarPlay. I am very pleased with the overall performance and quality."
4,Monster iCarPlay Wireless 200,TheMonster A IP FM-CH 200 iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter for iPod w/ Auto-Scanworks great on the road or in a large metro area. I bought it for a 6-hour drive to NC at Christmas and was completely satisfied with the reception and the auto-scan feature is sweet. Its easy to use. I can recommend it and give it 4 stars. Why not 5 stars you might ask? Well its because I believe Monster could have made the plug a bit slimmer and streamlined which would make it fit better into the power outlet in most cars that come with attached outlet covers. I previously tried theMonster iCarPlay Wireless Plus FM Transmitter/Charger for iPodwhich had good reception but didn't have the auto-scan. It was too distracting to change while driving because you had to look at the read-out to change the station.
1,Make up your mind.,"Ok, as I've said in the past, he is talented. The problem is, he hasn't made up his mind on who he intends to be...and he is too old to be that indecisive. This professional review says it best (www.splendidezine.com/ review.html?reviewid=10815329601128299), where the folks at Splendid Ezine ask if this 40 year old Spaniard is really trying to break onto the dance scene with A-Chi-Li-Pu and expect his more contemporary fans to take him seriously. Was that girl doing the english vocals ( Danielle Garrison ) really a singer or was it just some silly girl he dragged into the studio to impress? I would guess that latter. Get back on track Jose...or your fans will desert you!"
2,Rescue me from reading this....,"This book is slow, seems half-written and I thought the ending terrible. After finishing the book I felt cheated. I don't think the characters were fully explored, the story was sometimes muddled and the end felt like it should have been the begining of the real story! I say pass on it and take something else to the beach to read."
2,Too Much Like a Screenplay,"The storyline was interesting but Grazer failed to fully develop her characters. Instead, she jumped around from one scene to another. The plot was uneven and, IMHO, underdeveloped. Grazer looks like she has great potential (Stepmom was an excellent story). She's very creative & inciteful. I would definitely watch out for her next work, though."
1,Did I read a different book?,"I really hated this book. I didn't like any of the characters, and the writing was so uneven. Amanda made no sense, and the rest of the people in the book seemed paper-thin - so many things would happen for seemingly no reason. I kept waiting for everything to somehow tie together, but it really didn't. Gabe was too perfect - we are asked to believe his life pre-Amanda was just working in a car factory and hanging out with his drug dealer buddy. Also, why did Amanda end up marrying James? Even with the events leading up to the marriage, I find that hard to believe. And what about her boss at the TV show? Why was he even in the book? I honestly had to force myself to finish the book. Not recommended."
2,okay/fine but not great,"I loved Gigi's book ""Maneater"" so I was interested in other works by her. This one was an okay read but not super great."
1,Oh Please!,"I'm very surprised that this book comes from the writer of Stepmom, one of my more likeable movies. This book is TERRIBLE!!! With my job especially allowing for a lot of reading, I can get through a book in two days. This has taken me over a month and I'm still only halfway through it. In the meantime, I've finished about 5 other books because this is the one that I dread going back to. To be honest, I may not even finish it it's that bad. Either that or it will make for good bathroom reading when you have nothing else. Don't waste your money!!!"
5,Rescue Me by Gigi Levangie Grazer,"Wonderful Anytime Read...I bought the book because I really enjoyed The Starter Wife. Gigi impressed me with this book and I would highly recommend this book to others. It's a good book that one can talk about with friends, or in my case co-workers."
