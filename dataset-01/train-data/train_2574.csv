3,Expected much better,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the initial TPB of Hellboy, as the only real experience I had with the character (and series concept) was the movies, of which I enjoyed the first quite a bit (the second one, not so much).Having now read the story that inspired much of the plot of the first film, I have to say that I vastly prefer the way that the movie took the direction of the ideas presented.While Hellboy himself is somewhat of an interesting character, there's just too much time expanding on superfluous characters that don't provide either advancement of the plot or insight as to why Hellboy (or Liz or Abe) are the way that they are. Some of this could be chalked up to ""freshman writing jitters"" were it not for the fact that John Byrne - a rather experienced writer of the medium - handled the actual script based off ideas by Mignola.Byrne should have been able to craft a tighter story than this."
2,quality not good,"The binding fell apart in the first reading. Not the sellers doing, but the product was defective. It wasn't worth returning."
3,"Holy crappy binding, Hellboy!","The story was great, fantastic art, much love for Hellboy, but that's all been covered already by other reviewers. Here's the thing: I love my books, and treat them all with special care in the hopes that they'll last forever. By the time I had read through this graphic novel ONE TIME, the cover had fallen off in my hands, and pages were coming loose from the binding! For the price they're charging, I'd expect a book that doesn't self-destruct after a half-hour. (To be fair, I also bought volume two, which did not fall apart...yet.)"
4,From Hell It Came,"This is the first book in the Hellboy series (soon to be amajor motion picture). This is the only book I have read in the series, so far. It's an good start. The characters are intriguing and the artwork is fantastic. It made me want to read more of Hellboy's stories, which of course is what the first comic in a series is supposed to do. I would recommend this book to comics fans who like their heroes to be a bit out of the ordinary."
3,"5 star story, 1 star binding","Great story, great art, book fell apart in my hands on the first read through - something that's *never* happened to me before."
3,"Quite Good, but Byrne's dialogue weakens it.","If you're looking to get into the world of Hellboy, I would suggest any of the other better trade paperbacks as a starter--paticularly Right Hand of Doom, since it recaps Hellboy's origins.First off, the main problem with this book is John Byrne's dialogue--not that it's bad in and of itself, but it doesn't ""read"" like Hellboy. Byrne chose to give the character the typical tough guy talk--not bad, but much better done by Frank Miller.Another problem with this book is the colors--they're terribly green and dull, not evoking a mystical or scary look, just a ugly looking color job.Mignola's gorgeous art is the saviong grace of this book--his brilliant character design and sense of storytelling are fantastic."
4,Rich art work,"I like this a lot more than I thought I would. I wasn't too crazy about the movie but I really like the books. The art and colors are great, and the story is more sophisticated than most comics. I plan on reading more Hellboy."
3,5 star yarn on a 1 star binding = 3.,"This is good and its praises are all over.. but I think the terrible binding should be pointed out yet again. Falls apart quick. For a twenty (well 18) dollar (most comparable volumes'd run you 15 on lesser paper) book, the thing falls out of its paper pretty fast.That's all I gotta say about this. If you want it, get the Library Editions."
3,Go further back than this one.,"As an Australian fan of You Am I, I feel considerably aggrieved that Amazon have not stocked their first two albums, 'Sound As Ever' and 'Hi Fi Way'. These two releases probably represent the best work produced by any Australian band since the Birthday Party, outplaying The Who at their own game. 'Hourly Daily' on the other hand, represents the downturn in Tim Roger's career. The simplistic pop and garage rock of his previous work is here replaced by the dull and over-indulgent use of a horn and string section, as well as a commentary on the 'little people' of suburbia. This work is NOT the best this incredible Australian band can do; only on minor gems like 'Mr Milk' and 'Soldiers' do they approach the standard of their oldies. Look elsewhere."
4,Another landmark album in Aussie rock ...,"You am I continue to deliver the freshest and most energetic sounds in ""Hourly Daily"" their 3rd album....reminiscent of the sixties Kinks, and other great pop bands Tim Rogers and the boys deliver beautifully catchy tunes with a hard guitar edge. Standout tracks ...""Mr. Milk"" , ""Soldiers"" in fact there isn't a bad tune on it. Their fourth album , titled ""You am I's #4 Record""..and ,like their 2nd album ""Hi Fi Way"", strangely not listed by Amazon...should be complusory listening for all rock fans....as should Tim Roger's recently released (in Australia) solo album ""What Rhymes with Cars and Girls"". Buy all the You am I albums ....and hear the best Aussie rock has to offer."
4,The Best Children's Choir Around,"There's no doubt these kids are good. I have never heard a better children's choir. They sing extreemly hard material almost flawlessly. The biggest problem with this CD is some of the songs are downright boreing. Mediocre folk songs sung in unison are not highlights. But some other songs are quite interesting. My favorite is Aglepta. You can't describe it except to say it is strange, and absolutly wonderful. It is one of my favorite choral compositions of all time and this is the best performance of it I have ever heard. Overall, I would recommend this CD, but have your finger on the skip button."
3,Virtua Tennis 3,Good game to play with you pal however very short game. I wish they had included few more levels into the game
4,Real like players physics,"Federer, Nadal, Monfit, etc... They move as if you were watching them in a real match. The only thing is that the graphics could be better on the players. Great price too."
5,"Fun to play, very realistic and great graphics","I already had the previous game on PSP and I loved it. Now, this one comes out on PS3 and it is soooo gooooood. Has excellent game play, very real movements, graphics are breathtaking. There is nothing wrong I can say about this game. If you like Tennis, this is a must have.The best tennis game out!"
4,Virtua Tennis....,"Well let me start out by saying that I absolutely detest sport games I have never owned a single one for any of my consoles,But my friend (whom I met at a line up for the PS3's ^-^) Swore by this game and said I had to get it. So I went and bought it on the cheap for $11.75. And all I have to say is WOW what a game,You can make your own player and build his stats as you see fit,Pick were in the world you want your home base and do alot of fun mini games (aka training).Overall a very good buy considering all the features it has to offer,only complaint...no online for PS3 :'("
3,"Graphics are good, but the game is useless after a few hours(PS3 version)","Firstly, I am not a fanboy of any console. Here is my unbiased opinion on Virtua tennis3. Get the XBOX 360 version if you want to play online. The ps3 version might look a tad better graphically(in offline mode), but lacks online functionlity and I know for sure that many of you folks would love to play any sports game online since CPU based challenges are quite boring.Everything else about the game is pretty good. Definitely better than Topspin 2, but Topspin for XBOX is still the best tennis game(unfortunately Topspin does not play on the 360).As for the PS3 owners(including me), we have to hope the SEGA magically develops some interest towards PS3 and gives us online play(both Virtua tennis and Virtua fighter) or Sony needs to develop more sports games inhouse too."
3,"Great game, but short story","I was very excited when i first got this game.It has great graphics, and is very fun to play.The only problem that i see, is that even though it has various game modes, they are not so exciting, they help you to improve your in game abilities, but the get very boring after a while.I finished playing with the story mode in 2 weeks, its kind of hidious because all you do is play and play the same thing over and over, but there is not much to do about it, its a tennis game, the same happens with soccer games, basketball games, etc.I havent tried it by playing with somebody else, none of my friends are PS3 fans, but it looks like a great game to play between 2 or more people.I am a huge fun of tennis, and thats why i got it, when i cant go out to play real tennis because of rain or other reasons, the game makes me feel almost as excited as playing in real life.Its not a must have, unless you are a big fan of the game!"
4,"Good, but not perfect!!!","Great graphics an all, but lack: multiplayer online, outside balls (pros do make mistakes same times!!) and Djovich!!!!"
4,The Chinese Ginger Jars,"The book content is great: well written, progresses naturally and fast enough to keep interest, makes one feel that the author is a real person with whom the reader can easily identify. A book to be shared with joy, but the cover is not at all attractive and did not meet my standards to be used as a special gift--which was one of the reasons I bought it."
1,Tiny,"This must be the smallest 1/6 figure I have seen. It measures about 8 inches. The Oneechanbara 1/6 figure I received in the same shipment from Hohotoys measures 11 inches and looks Amazonian next to this one.Also, the colors are way different from the pictures on the box. The shirt is unevenly yellow (not ecru): lighter on top and ""yellower"" on bottom. The hair is a rather deep bushy green. The flesh is quite splotchy (like a bad tan) and not very attractive.If you like questionable paint job and midget-y 1/6 scale. This is for you."
1,Not for a beginner,"I did not like this book. I sent it back. I found it to be limited in useful items and full of silly items, the picures seem to be more about Miss Bordhi than showing a clear view of the item to be knitted and the instructions were brief at best."
5,"Knitting out of ""the box""",Cat's book will have you thinking about knitting in an entirely different way than you've ever thought of it before! You'll certainly find something in here to nudge your creativity and be thinking of doing many new things with your needles and yarn. The book is a special memory for me after having a mobius workshop with her. She shares both her personality as well as her love of the craft of knitting in the book. It is a treasury you will treasure because of the clear instructions and explanations.
5,Warning This Technique is Addictive,"I love this book and I love the Moebius knitting concept. I know others have created patterns based on the Moebius strip, but I have to say that beginning to end, once you master the cast-on, this technique is a blast. The cast-on is tricky, but after a couple false starts, I was using this cast-on like a pro. I made my first scarf in an afternoon and couldn't wait to move on to the second one. Fun, fun, fun and very satisfying. Certainly, not a beginner book, but once you have mastered the basic knit & purl skills, you should have no trouble with this technique."
2,Interesting but not enough meaty material for an entire book,"Cat Bordhi is creative, innovative and enthusiastic so her books are a pleasant read. However, this one is very thin on substance that a knitter can actually use.The mobius cast on and mobius scarf technique are interesting and worth a try but the technique belongs in a book with other innovative techniques as it is not enough in itself to support the entire book (never mind the second one as well!) The number of unappealing variations make one feel as though the author was straining to come up with enough material to fill the page quota."
4,great fun,My friend turned me on to moebius scarf knitting and this book is really great fun. I am a beginning knitter and even I can understand most of the instructions and it has great photos in it too.
2,not satisfied with the instructions,I have been a knitter for over 40 years and am adept at reading patterns. This particular book was written assuming people had taken her class. If you haven't the insturctions are skimpy at best. I was very disappointed. I tried to email her at her email from the book and received no response.
4,Marvelous Moebius,"Cat Bordhi's book on the moebius loop is a bit of a one-trick pony, but you gotta admit, it's a really good trick. The patterns are the same thing over & over again in different gauges, but the cast-on technique is clearly explained & was quite easy to pick up. This one's a good addition to the knitting library."
4,For the mind and the fingers,"Cat writes engagingly about the mobius and the creative process she experienced in channeling the projects in the book. I appreciated her encouragement along the way with guidance like ""If something goes wrong, rejoice and dive in to see what treasures are revealed"" and ""Find something to do more or less of and see what happens"" and best of all, ""Have at it"". Sure, if you stick to her patterns you'll have great projects, but if you stick to her advice to engage your creative muse you'll also have the satisfaction of a one-of-a-kind reflection of you. One caution with this as well as any other knitting book: do an internet search for errata before you start any project."
5,Quick get my needles!,This book is luscious. From the pictures to descriptions and easy to follow instructions. You will want to knit at least one of everthing. I am eagerly waiting her Treasury of Magical Knitting ll.
1,One Trick Pony,"The author is overly enthusiastic about the techniques she ""invents"" or more accurately ""publishes."" Her marketing is what I'd call magical as the infamous moebius cast on is nothing more than a provisional cast with a twist at the end."
3,too much like the second,"I bought the second book before I bought this one, so obviously almost all of it was redundant. I would recommend buying the second and skipping the first. The second has many more ideas, whereas the first one has only one thing to contribute really."
3,"If you own volume 2, read this first!","I purchased Volume 2 first and found this a bit of a let down, even though there are some very nice patterns in it. I had already experimented with the moebius form and I'm into freeform so find Cat's techniques and ideas inspirational, but I could also have lived without this particular volume, especially with international postage on it! That said, if you have never ever played with a moebius, or find the instructions on the web too confusing, this is for you! Her instructions are brilliant, so that even a novice knitter can follow them easily. And I certainly learnt an awful lot about knitting and following patterns, and self-discipline ( rueful grin)."
2,For Amateurs.,"To me, this isn't really even a hotsauce. It's strictly kid stuff with all the heat and power of a mitten. As for its flavor, I don't think much of it. I'm not sure what buying a moped recipe like this does for someone. I wouldn't even bother with it."
4,Good Passion -- Probably not by Bach,"This performance of the ""Apocryphal"" St. Luke Passion is performed in a light and fresh manner. It is thouroughly enjoyable. The work is most likely not by Bach. If it is, he wrote it when he was very young. (Handwriting analysis suggests the manuscript was copied by Bach and his son, later in his life.) The composer's taste is not as mature as Bach's in his genuine St. John and St. Matthew Passions. (The opening chorus, ""Fear and trembling . . ."" is way too upbeat and happy.) The recitatives sound very much like Bach. The chorales are similar to Bach, but the melodies are slightly different from those used by Bach in his Passions. I would reccomend this recording to those who like Bach's Passions, and who are curious about works that have been attributed to him. Great performance, great recording!"
4,Season Of Change Review,"I find this movie brillaint and loving, I watched this film about 4 years ago on tele and I hadnt been able to find it in the UK on video. So luckily I found it on this website and I've only recently bought it. Apparently this movie has only been realsed in the United States and where I live it's wanted by many people."
3,ok for an anthro book,"I was made to read this book for my anthro class. It was interesting to read about teh family situations, I read all of this book. This book contains a lot of diagrams and charts, so there is even less text to read. A little outdates perhaps though!"
3,Nothing special,"I agree with the reviewer who found this performance nothing special, with poor sound, to which I would add that the violin playing sounded lightweight--possibly the fault of the recording, but I am inclined to think not. Interpretively, the performance was fine, and there were many things to admire about Ms. Morini's technique; but overall, I can't get worked up over this rather underpowered performance. A disclaimer, however: I only heard the Tchaikovsky; maybe the Brahms was more convincing."
4,"""Wouldn't you like to know?""","Terminal Games begins a bit slow, progressing in pace as the story progresses. I, personally, am not an avid reader. I found it difficult to put the book down, wanting to know what happens next.I also found myself speculating the end, as well as the possible perpetraitor. I began to suspect everyone's involvement.Overall, I think this book was good, there were areas that obviously were more fantastic than real, but the author kindly explains this in his Acknowledgements.Good job, ""Mr. Perriman.""Augie is Augie!"
4,Insights into how one very successful fund manager invests,"Bill Miller has been outperforming the stock market for more than a decade but he isn't as outspoken as other fund managers. Fortunately, Janet Lowe has been able to learn how Miller chooses investments--how he evaluates companies, decides when to buy and sell and more. She has interviewed Miller, his colleagues as well as industry experts to provide an interesting and enlightening portrait of Miller."
1,Not Much Here,"This book contains few new revelations about Miller. If you've read any magazines articles about him, you've got the just of how he invests. This book adds nothing to this. His record of late is also showing that he's no god. Maybe his time has come and gone."
5,gluten free comfort food,"We bought this months ago, but it sat in the pantry because our pasta experiences have been rather gross. My daughter finally talked me into giving it a try...I like it so much better than the old Kraft Mac & Cheese! This has a great cheese flavor without the plastic aftertaste. I followed the directions exactly (6 minutes was perfect), and was happily surprised. The texture and flavor of the pasta was excellent. I'm going to use it as a base for GF tuna casserole."
2,"Edible, but not as good as Annie's","This Mac & Cheese product is passable, but not what I would call ""good."" The best part is that the noodles don't fall apart too much (although I suppose if you overcooked it, it would -- like all rice pastas). But the texture and flavor were both very blah. The color is also unappetizing, if that matters to you. Note to DeBoles -- If you must use a brown pasta, you might consider compromising a bit and using a little yellow food coloring in the sauce. Brown Mac & Cheese really just doesn't look yummy. After trying it, I added a can of tuna fish and that made it ok. I'm glad I bought one box at the store to try instead of a case from Amazon. It's worth the extra money to buy the Annie's Rice Mac & Cheese product instead. Annie's is MUCH better."
4,Great mac and cheese!,"My son has a wheat sensitivity and we are always looking for good rice mac and cheese. We tried Deboles one time when we were visiting our grandparents and the kids loved it. I wasnt able to find it in the local stores where I live. So, I found it through Amazon. All three of my children could not be happier eating this yummy, creamy mac and cheese."
2,Yuck - like cardboard,I thought this particular brand of gf mac n cheese was disgusting.. I threw it out - painful considering how expensive it was! It had no taste.. Buy tinkiyada elbow rice macaroni and make your own cheese sauce.. It's much closer to the real thing..
1,Save your money,"You could hear the rain on the metal roof as they waited for it to stop before they went ""naked into the wilderness""."
1,i feel like an idiot,I'm so mad i didn't think to read the review on this dvd because it was dead on. This was one of the worst dvd's I've ever bought. They just dink around with arts and crafts and they don't even show you how to do any of the things they do. I learned nothing from this dvd and i strongly encourage you to never think about this dvd ever again.
4,Entertaining and Informative,"I bought this video for my boys, who love learning primitive skills. They did learn a lot from this DVD. It is entertaining in the fact that the participants, especially the creator of the film, are real Mountain Men (and a woman) who aren't afraid to act the part. I didn't give it 5 stars because the quality of film isn't spectacular, and the music is a little off-putting. But the boys love it, and would probably be able to use some of the tips in here if they wanted."
2,"Hmm, not so good.","I purchased this book for $1 plus shipping. I paid $1 to much. Very poor reproductions. Lawrence is an artist that deserves to be seen and this book does a poor job in presenting his work. There are much better books on his work, seek them out."
5,so sweet,this dvd includes various stories of the miracles of the humble and gentle Saint Martin de Porres - you will love it very much though in Spanish - is well translated and you will have no problems understanding it all - we highly recommend it
2,Awful looking,"Our Queen puppet looks like a deranged geriatric mental patient without dentures in. Her bottom jaw sticks out so much further than her top lip that my girls 3 and 5 will not play with her. She does not appear like this in the photo here, so I am guessing it is not how she was intended to be. Because I am a busy mom, I didn't contact Amazon before 30 days so I wasn't able to exchange her. Several of our M&D puppets looked 'wrong.' Too bad."
5,Panasonic DMC ZR1 Fits Great In This Great Camera Case,"I had purchased a compact Panasonic DMC ZR1 and actually contacted LowePro for help. Emailed my camera dimensions and model. Got back 3 choices, which saved me going through the many choices they have. I then read the reviews and was grateful that people gave the camera models they had for the case in question. This helped me figure out how the inside dimensions would work with my camera. I could look up their camera and dimensions and work from there. By comparing their camera dimensions and comments on fit to mine I knew that this case was my best choice. BTW my camera dimensions are: 3 3/4"" (W) x2 1/4"" (H) x 1"" (D). I took into account the zoom lens sticking out some and chose this case. Not too tight. Not too loose. Just right. Thanks to Lowepro for their help and to all the reviewers. A great case. Protects the camera and gives versatility with its carry options. Just right for my needs."
1,"Five stars for the film, but 1 for the region 2 DVD being sold","Yes, this is a great film - I can understand why people rave about it. My review is a warning about the import region 2 UK DVD being sold by some Amazon sellers. It's absolutely dreadful - the sound is ok, but the picture is a mess and clearly taken from an old VHS tape (zoom back on the picture and you can see signs of VHS head switching). It's also been through an NTSC-PAL conversion, so watching it in North America will mean giving it another conversion back to NTSC - the DVD already has barely any detail in it, so another conversion will likely finish it off completely. The disc is from Orbit Media, who are a public domain specialist (the film is actually be owned by Universal). It looks worse than any bootleg."
3,the cat and the canary,"Bought this movie ,relying on memory of a great Bob Hope movie,but this was not the movie I remembered.(The movie I really needed is THe Ghost Breakers),waiting on this movie to arrive in Australia by post from Amazon ,However The Cat and the Canary is quite amusing,Hope is his usual comic self and Paulette Goddard is very easy on the eye (don't tell my darling wife ! )By the way,Amazons service and delivery to Australia is terrific,could not be more happy"
2,A little boring. 2 1/2 STARS,"I had high hopes for this movie but it was somewhat of a let down.If you are interested in the spooky but funny movies, you will enjoy The Ghost Breakers, Arsenic and Old Lace and The Ghost and Mr. Chicken. All are part of my spooky but funny classics library. HAPPY HALLOWEEN!"
2,"Great film, awful DVD","I agree with everyone else that this is a great film, but this DVD is unwatchable on a video projector. This is a second-or-third generation 3/4"" video tape copy and is totally smeared and fuzzy. And this piece of doo-doo cost me $19.I thought this was an official release, but somehow this Paramount film has apparently fallen into public domain. I only hope that some other video company can track down the negative and do a proper transfer. Until then, you can watch this on your laptop in a tiny window. It shouldn't look as bad as it does on my 6' screen.If you've got a mojo for a Bob Hope horror comedy, his next film was ""The Ghostbreakers"" and is available from MCA in great condition."
4,"Great film,okay dvd.","This review is really to confirm what a couple of other (British) reviewers have said:although this isn't a pristine copy of the film of the standard of Ghost Breakers it is currently the best version available.Both sound and picture are far superior to the Region 2 version and well worth buying simply for that.That's not to say there aren't faults with this copy,there are,but even so I would defintely recommend this until someone like Universal gets back the copyright and issues a decent version worthy of this classic film.As for the film itself,well,it's a classic,one of Hope's best movies.Funny and scary,a formula that's often been copied but never been bettered,it is the pinnacle of the old dark house kind of movie.If you're going to buy it,then currently,mid-2008,this is the copy to buy."
4,Not available at the time...,"At the time I made my purchase these episodes were sold seperately(not 2 dis in 1 box)I still like them...the quality is poor but, I finally have all that I canget of George and Gracie on dvd.I thought by purchasing the dvd there would be no commercials, well boy was Iwrong. Gracie used so much Carnation cream that she forgot to add coffee inone episode...:)"
1,Hunk of junk,"This would be a lot of fun, if it worked. It was broken, right out of the box. Main rotor was cracked and shaft was stripped. Epoxy fixed this and got to fly, for about 1-2 seconds. Then, the lower motor gear slipped off. This happens every time you start the motor. When the main rotor spins, it takes flight, sans the rest of the helicopter. I will say that the rotor flys well, if only the rest of the copter accompied it."
1,Lower quality than I expected,"I'm not sure what the story is with the 5-star reviews listed here. Maybe they got a different product. I tested this out five times in the same spot while out hiking (got it out of my pocket, opened it up and leveled it to find magnetic north, then closed it and put it back in my pocket) and it pointed four slightly different directions. My old Silva clear plastic compass, on the other hand, pointed the same exact direction each time. To its credit, this compass was apparently correct on the two occasions when it agreed with itself.In a survival situation, this compass would be better than not having one, but that's all I can say for it."
3,Juts Ok,Don't think its of a great quality as anticipated.You get what you pay for....It's not super accurate either and looks fancy from the outside....
3,got moneys worth.,"shipped and received without any problems. it is nifty and has fun gadgets, but is what i paid for. inexpensive but does the job."
2,Cheap,Buy cheap you get cheap. It works but I don't know how much abuse it can take. I have to tap it with my finger to get the pin to move but when it is done I have found the readings to be consistent.
5,The best compass I will ever own...Period,"Where to start, the product is in a small Velcro pouch to being with and its very resilient. The compass is impressive, all the things it does are really helpful, even can range out meters with a small measurement tool so it's multifunctional. Not sure whats wrong with the other reviewers, this product is so good, i'm buying another one right now."
3,Not Bad But Not Great,"When the compass arrived the sighting wire was far too loose. While attempting to tighten it the wire snapped. Part error on my part, but I think they should be shipped with the correct tension on the wire. As for the rest of the compass, I rather like it. It is not the most precise instrument ever made, but it is good enough for my purposes. For the price I am pleased enough to keep it and use it. I'll just use a strand of hair or paracord to replace the sighting wire."
2,POOR VISIBILITY!!!,"This is not a bad compass...for the daylight hours! Doesn't glow @ night & that would be because there isin't any ""tritium"" that's what makes the real compasses glow! ie: the ""COMENGA"" I think it's spelled that way...The cost is extremely higher! So...if you're looking for a cheap comp-a$$ for occasional daytime hike etc...then this is what you need! If you want a decent compass for your BOB...Then you need to look at the Comenga! ~~ just a little side note, read all the fine print when purchasing one because they...""Comenga's"" are calibrated specifically for certain areas ie: Countries ~~ end note! Thanks for reading & remember...Rubber side down...(wheels on the ground)& keep your powder dry...NORSEMAN"
1,Junk!,Dial is sticky and must perfectly level then tapped in order to get a reading. USELESS! Not even worth returning so it is now a toy for my 5 year old...
4,"Good - Not The Best, But Still Worth The Money","This isn't a bad compass for the money.I ordered two, and compared them against one another. They both point north, but disagree to a small degree.I think what is throwing people is that this compass is not real fast. You have to open it, maybe tap the glass, and let it ""find"" magnetic north. It's not the strongest compass, but it does work. It is good for pointing in the correct direction, but you do have to give it a few seconds.I was actually impressed with the casing. It has good weight, and is very solid.One day, I will probably upgrade to a better compass. But, I wanted one in the BOB now, and this one is just fine for that purpose."
5,I feel like a King in my Royal Elastics.,"I love these shoes. After years of flirting with sneakers I am finally ready to settle down. Personally I like the Classic and Mesh styles. I wore my first pair of Royal Elastics through a nasty New York City winter and they kept my feet snug, dry and amazingly comfortable. The design of this shoe is quite remarkable - the dark days of fraying shoe laces are at an end. Also, if you have wide feet like I do, or any strange shaped feet for that matter, they are a god send. My only complaint is that the logo is a bit prominent and a bit loud for my taste on most shoe designs, and some of the designs are a bit flamboyant for my taste. Still, that's just me. Buy these shoes - you will be hooked. I would love to buy the Mesh or Classic styles in red - if anybody from RE reads this. I feel like a King in my Royal Elastics. Your loyal subject, Eoin."
5,Amazingly beautiful collection ...,"Whatever the source, this is one of the most beautiful collections of so-called chill I've ever heard. If you're looking for wallpaper music, this may not be it, because one cannot help listening. From the almost operatic vocals (along the line of Emma Shapplin) to the loungey mixes (and excellent sound production), no one will complain when you put this in the player."
5,This is your awakening call !,"To all you synthpop fans out there , who haven't hearded yet of ""Iris"". this album offers a different sound from their debut album (disconnect) , a more mature one. they've also addes few guitars riffs th this one - and made this one even better than""disconnect"". all the songs here are very good."
5,You will not be able to get this CD out of your head!!,"I was a fan of Iris's first CD 'Disconnect' but when I heard 'Awakening', I was blown away! There are so many people that I'm sure would absolutely love this CD but just aren't aware that it exists. The vocals are fresh and passionate. The synth work is clean and incredible."
1,More Cheesy Techno,"If you like really bad, generic house music with simple lyrics, you'll adore this cd. Otherwise, if you're more into real electro-clash music reminiscent of 80's new wave, try The Faint, Danse Macabre."
4,Hooked on Iris,"Best Tracks-* Whatever - I like the dark mood of this song* Unknown - love the near-falsetto parts of melody and complementary vocal delays; great song* Sorrow Expert - for me, undoubtedly the best track on the project; I was singing along even with the first listen; A+ melody. Impressive programming as well.* You're the Answer - as soon as I read they were covering this, I immediately pulled my copy of the 7Red7 cd and listened. They did it justice. Overall a great cover, and a good upbeat track for the album.* Vacant - dark; a song you can sink your teeth into, is the only way I know to describe it* Wait Move On - great programming, melody & my second favorite album track.The vocal production is amazing as well. If you're an electronica or an Iris fan, you must have this CD. Brilliance! And if you don't have the Disconnect album, order it with this one!"
1,This game stinks,"Unbelievably bad game. No season, no roster management, the homerun derby is boring...I have a 6 year old baseball game for original gameboy that beats this garbage hands down. Don't waste your money."
1,The worst game ever!,"If you want baseball, buy All Star Baseball 2001! This game stinks! The game play is extremely slow, the graphics stink, and I guarantee that it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to hit a ball. I do not have one positive comment about this game. EA Sports should be ashamed of themselves for making such a horrible game. I mean, no season, no playoffs, and they call this baseball! ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,Still looking for a good baseball game.....,"I have almost always enjoyed games made by EA Sports, however Triple Play 2001 has taught me not to trust the game producer just because they have made a good game before. The game play is slow, the computer has zero intelligence and the control of the players is horrible. EA Sports must have know it was a terrible game because they didn't even bother to make a season or playoffs available. I guess they knew that no one would have the patience to play this game through an entire playoff much less a 162 game season."
4,a good game,I thought this game was pretty cool. I had a spanking good time playing it. You'll probably like it.
1,Terrible,"This is a horrible game. One of the worst things is that they claim that the team rosters are updated when their not at all. Kerry Wood is not on the Cubs, while Trachsel is still on that team; Rod Beck is still on the Red Sox; Mike Hampton isn't on the Mets. None of the rosters are updated. That's very annoying! The gameplay itself is not too bad, but having year old rosters is too off putting!"
3,"Uneven, but worth the time and trouble","If you are already a convert, you'll love this stuff. But if you're a curious scholar, like me, you're going to find this tough sledding at times. I don't like the way the book is organized. But I think most thinking people will find it a useful roadmap into the minds of feminists and it's a good place for men to begin if they want to get a handle on this important movement. Like it or not, the feminists are here to stay."
5,Should be required reading in school,"Feminists of each generation, I think, have to do a lot of reinventing of the wheel. We don't know our own history, and although in 2001 we take for granted the ideas that women can be professional athletes or CEOs, that families are not all alike, that equal pay for equal work is fair and right...these ideas were once radical, and not that long ago. Likewise, in the 1970s universal suffrage was taken for granted...and the struggles of women activists in the 1920s were forgotten. This is a valuable collection of writings which gives us some of that history back. It covers important feminist thought from 1949 to 1993. This book holds important lessons for all of us, on religion, rape, health, pornography, family, race, sexual orientation...all manner of relevant and fascinating work."
4,My first Fem Book that I read-,I am reading another one-but have gotten more into this one... it is connecting the dots to things I have known but not full scale. It was a relief to see things in words- written- the guts to write what I have thought- not in anger but in truth and enlightenment. Women need to know the truth of what we have gone through so we can continue to teach the youth so they do not take it for granted our rights and freedoms.
4,nostalgic and heartwarming,"My father grew up in the north end of Boston, and it brought back lots of fond memories of mygrandmother and the great meals we had at her home with lots of family and friendsgathered around. The recipes are great, although I would have loved more photos!"
1,Kindle Edition is Awkward,"This is an excellent cookbook but not very usable in the Kindle Edition.It is very difficult to navigate through the book and the index is not linked (and is difficult to read)...And speaking of Kindle...I think if we buy the hard copy book on Amazon, it would be great for us Kindle owners to be able to buy the Kindle Edition for a couple more dollars!"
1,Kindle version is bad,"I bought the kindle version of this book. It is missing text, photos and other pertinent information to make the book useful. I prefer ebook versions over hard cover. I should not get a different format than the hard cover, nor should I get less information. Their are ingredients missing for recipes making this book useless for me. I intend on trying to get a refund for the ebook."
5,"""Atlast "" Some Helpful Information","I have suffered with this disease for over 20 years and this (plus a book called Striking Back - which I just also found) have the most accurate description of symptoms and treatment of this disease. Extremely helpful for patient and friends and family members who don't understand the disease and are at a loss to know what to do to help.I was amazed that the description of the pain that I have given friends and doctors for years is the exact same wording for the pain used in this book.It gives a person with the disease information on doctors, meds, treatments etc. and hope knowing someone out there is doing something to help. Buy this book if you have the disease or care about someone who does."
3,"Source Book, Research Handbook","As anyone knows who has TN, there is always an answer to a problem around the corner. I thought this book would have some of those answers waiting for me. Instead it is a research guide to finding your way through the maze of scientific date concerning this curious and painful malady. Somewhat disapointing, but then again it really is a research tool. In that respect it provides a considerable amount of data all in one place."
5,Hard Christian Rock similar sound to the Wallflowers,Dryve is a great band! Thrifty Mr. Kickstart has fast paced rock tunes to moving ballads complete with harmonica and hammond organ. Subject matter focus on issues all of us face such as why am I here? What is my purpose? Who can I trust? Thrifty Mr. Kickstart leaves you no doubt that God is there for you always! A great album for young adults facing tough struggles.
5,Awesome! A must have!,"I have over 250 CDs, and this nearly unknown jewel tops them all. The songs are just a plain joy to listen to. The music is both soothing and emotional and the songs are fantastic to sing along to. It's hard to compare this CD with any other, although I'd say Dryve's music is comparable to the Wallflowers, Old 97s, and U2. I couldn't praise this band or the CD enough. I bet you'll come to the same conclusion."
4,"""I can't rent a prayer""","This CD doesn't really get up and running until track 4 (""Thrifty Mr. Kickstart""). The song ""Manifold"" closes out the album with a longing and long song. There's a lite kick to the music but it's an often quiet and alternative rock sound that pervades the album. References to The Wallflowers (especially the ""Bringing Down the Horse"" CD) are appropriate. Very similar in tone and style to a great little (and gone) band called Dimestore Prophets. If you like this CD you should check them out."
4,excellent,"Excellent piece and good execution, what more? In effect not always convinced by the conducting at times erratic or is it the music that is not what we expect? Cool down and listen again, all things go in place and it is a cd to buy for sure, if nothing else for the other rarities included."
3,Good looking; doesn't withstand dishwasher...,"We really liked how this product looked in the picture and were impressed by the positive reviews on amazon. It looked quite good out of the box too, and we immediately thought it would be perfect for everyday wear. Now, ""everyday wear"" for me really means withstanding the dishwasher, and some of the pieces have done poorly in the dishwasher, showing signs of rust on several of the knives. The instructions warn you about using dishwasher soap with lemon in it (which we don't use) so it's a mystery about why they're rusting so fast. I think for the money, they really should be dishwasher safe. So, we're torn, because they look good and the weight is great for daily use, but having some of the pieces corrode after just a couple of weeks of use is upsetting. We're probably going to return them."
4,Nice Stuff,"Nice style. Good weight. Great price on Friday Sale. Bought two sets. However, as others have noted, I do see occasional rust spots on the knives. A little polish and I am good to go. Yamazaki has a trade-up program I need to investigate."
1,Expensive price for cheap product,"Plain and simple - the product is made of cheap Chinese stainless steel that is NOT stainless. Will rust, pit, etc.Don't purchase. Consumers should demand a higher quality. The only way to do that is force manufacturers to create a product that will sell. Keep this one from selling: look elsewhere."
4,Great Product,This Rice Cooker is a great buy. Its a no hassle cooking gadjet. The retractable power chord & the design is really good. The steam which condenses on the lid does not fall into the cookpot & drains out into a plastic collector that can be easily cleaned. Its been the best one we used so far.
4,Blazing performance.,"Hi folks, well I'm not nearly the jazz expert that many of the other reviewers here seem to be but I would like to add my two cents. It's a shame the sets are not complete but it can't be denied that the quartet is BLAZING on these cuts. Boy, once 'One Down, One Up' hits about the fifteen minute mark you have no doubt that you are listening to something special. No question there are other Coltrane recordings a new listener should start with, live or otherwise, but for a Coltrane aficionados this release is a real treat.However, I have to say I was rather shocked to hear the numerous dropouts in sound during the title track. I realize that this release is a large step up in fidelity from the bootlegs that are floating out there but proper jazz companies on the whole are usually quite honest about sound quality issues.Having said this, don't let it prevent you from picking up this double cd. Any chance to hear the quartet in a live setting is a real treat."
4,no compulsory,"Let's be clear about the music on these two cds : it's great music, both compelling and stunning. One Down One Up is the most exciting piece. But some other pieces are shunted (Afro Blue), interrumpted by radio presentation (My Favorite Things on its coda....). So an album for musicians and completists only. I should advise the wonderful Live at Birdland and The complete Village Vanguard sessions... Save your money or borrow it at your library or to a friend of yours."
2,FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES ONLY,"I cannot see the hype this reissue has generated. Not counting the sound, this sounds like every other live Coltrane recording, bottleg or authorized. The ""My Favorite Things"" has to be one of the lamest ever issued live from Trane and almost sounds like a preconcert warmup. Sorry folks, nothing new or earthshattering here."
2,What is up with the shorting out on the one up and down,Dont Get Me wrong I love Coltrane i cant sleep unless im listening to him. Also the sound quality is very good except on the song one up one down the microphone or the recording shorts out atleast 20 times during the song. Now The positives AFRO BLUE is my favorite song he plays even though its mambo santamaria i give trane lots of credit for doing covers of songs most stubbern jazz players wouldnt do that also my favorite things isnt the best ive heard but its decent. so in closing theres only 4 songs one is great but the one up one down mix is all screwed up but i still can recomend this album rip trane the best
2,No big deal,"I happened to be at the Half Note on many nights during this run, although not on these nights, if I remember. I though that Trane was battling the rest of the band and the rest of the band didn't want to do this anymore. It sounded overwrought. I had the bootlegs and I thought this release would have better sound. It doesn't. Save your money. Other than the 'historical' aspect, this is no big deal."
1,One waste of time,"Sorry, I should have known better. Not my favorite Coltrane period but I thought what the hey. Impulse usually delivers the goods. This is god aweful. The sound quality on the title track is just terrible with drop outs and distortion galore. Yes I know when and where it was recorded and there will be some Trane-iacs that will just have to have these discs and that's fine. I'm not one of them. I do own just about every side Trane ever did including all the Riverside/Ojc discs, Blue Notes, Atlantic (the deluxe Atlantic packages are the ones to have here, the sound quality is several notches above the previous cd issues), & Impulse. There is just too much good Trane out there to have to listen to this. I am very disappointed. As one music magazine back in the 70's used to say, ""Savory, but for special tastes."""
4,Audio Excellence,"I understand that this was put on DVD so you get more time and something close to the long extended concert of this music, and I love this DVD. I just wish Robert Rich would have put at least a few photos up to go with the DVD music. I suppose that would shorten the length of the music too much. Nice work thought. Masterful."
3,Quality of the book,"It was a bit shabby when I opened it, with dust over the cover and on the side. It looked like it had been on the shelves for years. A bit disappointed considering it was brought new and didn't look like it was new, and especially when it is for a present. A bit disappointing when this is my first and maybe only purchase on Amazon."
4,1909 Catalog Springfield Armory Museum; Arms and Accouterments,"This final 182 page catalog includes photos of about 200 arms in the collection and lists and describes hundreds more. Collection numbers for each entry greatly facilitate locating and identifying a particular weapon for the serious researchers. This 1909 catalog includes, updated information from the 1925 and 1939 inventories plus further data from the National Park Service. This catalog is an invaluable reference guide to the Springfield Armory Museum Collection. For the money you can't beat it."
5,Virtua Tennis 3,Game was purchased as a birthday present for a coworker. He reports the game is great. Career mode is challenging. Graphics and animation are very good. Great game overall!
4,Best tennis game so far,"This is definitely the best tennis game so far for the 360. The action is great, and so are the graphics. You have Roger, Andy, and Maria which are most of my favs. But to make this the ultimate, it would be nice to have some of the legends in there too. Otherwise, this game is good enough for me to get rid of my others. It is great to sit down, relax, and play tennis with Maria Sharapova..."
1,Terrible Game,"I decided to sell this game right after I played it once. The gameplay is just terrible. It's too easy to hit the ball, and it's just too unrealistic. By simply pushing one button, you can almost cover the entire court. It's not what the tennis game is in reality. So I would say if you really wanna enjoy the tennis game, go for Top Spin 2. Even though Top Spin 2 has been almost one year old, it's still way much better."
5,Probably the best tennis game out there ....,"This is a fun and challenging game for tennis buffs .... I would say it is probably the best tennis game out there ....The world tour is entertaining and enacts with a great similarity the life of a Pro (training, rest, tournaments, practice matches ....)Give it a try you won`t be disappointed ...."
5,Very Fun,"played the demo for this game for a while on xbox live so i decided to pick it up the game is tons of fun, i have played it for hours, didnt cost much either, great combo."
4,Mother's Day present,"This was a present for my Mother on Mother's Day. Except for the fact that it was in a plastic bottle (as opposed to the glass one pictured), my Mother was very happy with it. She has been a user of the product in question for many years. It's harder to find in stores because it's an older woman's fragrance, and stores only stock what young ladies want. Thus the on-line order."
2,negative,"Crash of my expectations considering other books of this author. Expected thriller, detective whatsoever, however this book is nothing to do with it."
3,A concise history of the 1st world war,A fairly complete narrative which includes a reasonable treatment of the air and sea war as well as the introduction of mechanized warfare. Nicely divides the war into phases to help the reader understand the big picture. Hardly any stories of individuals but rather deals with armies and ideals. Dry reading if you are looking for a novel but still an excellent resource for someone who wants to learn more about WW1.
4,No nonsense account of the War,"This is a very good book, especially for a more passive reader of history. It is relatively short and sticks to the major events during the war and does not get into meticulous details. The format is standardized with each chapter focusing on a particular year. The majority of each focues on the Western front but each chapter also details events on the Eastern, Italian, and Naval fronts. For anyone looking to increase their knowledge of WWI, I would recommend reading this first and if a particular event, campaign, etc. interests you, go get another book specifically written on that topic."
3,Tolerable reading that comes to conclusions about war.,"A long polemic about war - the horror of it, how we glorify it, how we think it gives us meaning. Note: the title of this book is misleading. Hedges does not argue that war gives us meaning, just that it seems to, and this meaning is shallow compared to love. A very personal account, probably best for those who already have some background on the balkan wars and political science in general. not extraordinary, but has some valuable content none-the-less."
2,Gray did it first and better.,"I would strongly suggest you first read _The Warriors: Reflections on Men in Battle_,(1959) by J. Glenn Gray. SAME major themes, better written. That said, get a copy of Hedges' book for his examination of recent US foreign policy."
2,overrated,I just could not figure out why I kept finding glowing reviews. It was average at best. Not recommended.
4,"Brutal, honest, painful.","This book is... profound. It's basically 200 some odd pages of Hedges ranting, almost drunkenly, in fury and despair, about everything he's seen and been through as as war correspondent. It's hard to read but impossible to put down. Arresting is the best way to describe it."
4,"Well written, makes you think...","This book is poignant and very well written. It digs deep into why war is so glamorous on the national level, and so ugly on the personal level. By sharing personal experiences and that of his colleagues, Hedges shows many different facets of the progression of war on the personal and national psyche. You may not agree with his conclusions, but you can't argue that he has the requisite experience to form an expert opinion. Not a happy, uplifting book by any stretch, but well worth the read."
2,disappointing,"Hedges is an excellent reporter and when he is telling a character's story or painting a scene the book comes alive. However the argument of the book is a meandering restatement of the ""war is hell"" theme, with all the various conflicts blurring indistinguishably together. It does not add much to our understanding of why it keeps happening. The book also falls somewhat short as a personal narrative. In contrast to some other journalist memoirs (such as BANG BANG CLUB) we don't learn much about Hedges's tradecraft - how does he work, does he speak the languages, etc. All in all it feels like a book Hedges felt he had to write, but we do not have to read."
2,Hypocrisy Incarnate,"Having made a good living covering--and ENJOYING (""I was an addict"")--war for several decades, Hedges now chooses to preach to us as a ""pacifist."" In fact, he has become an apologist for the terrorists who seek to destroy our society. We're asked to understand the ""rage"" of the WTC bombers. Indeed, when it comes to blaming the victim, Hedges has no peer. Hitler too was motivated by ""rage."" Did we fail to understand him?Well written but resolutely wrong-headed. Hedges simply cannot bring himself to oppose evil."
5,Taking down the glorious myth of war,"Chris Hedges' book is a graphic and eloquent description of the personal and social forces that lead to war, and its brutal reality that few see or believe. He has seen war up close and writes frankly about its horrors, and their effect on him and others he has known in that context. War, he writes, is a drug that hooks most people who come anywhere near it with a promise of being part of something greater than themselves. But he makes a convincing case for another path that is constructive rather than destructive, and that leads to both happiness and meaning in life. This is no self help book, but a cold look at something that eventually touches everyone."
4,Interesting theory,"I finished reading War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning by Chris Hedges. It is a very interesting book. Chris Hedges is a foreign correspondent that specializes in war correspondence. In the book he makes some very true statements:""We are tempted to reduce life to a simple search for happiness. Happiness, however, withers if there is no meaning. The other temptation is to disavow the search for happiness in order to be faithful to that which provides meaning. But to live only for meaning - indifferent to all happiness - makes us fanatic, self-righteous, and cold. It leaves us cut off from our own humanity and the humanity of others. We must hope for grace, for our lives to be sustained by moments of meaning and happiness, both equally worthy of human communion.""I recommend the book for those who wish to understand the meaning of war and how any people react to war."
4,Read this book,"Hedges opened my eyes to the inevitable role a nation's martial mythology has on its soldiers. I am grateful he wrote this. Regardless of your opinion of war, you need to read this."
5,Thank You Chris Hedges!,"After hearing the author interviewed on NPR I immediately rushed to purchase this book. I applaud the courage it took to present this timeless perspective on war in an age dominated by limited vision and devoid of understanding of the psychological and spiritual laws which govern all of our lives. I do not normally read about war, but the our President's insistence on the polarizing perspective of the ""evildoers"" being 'out there' has made this book even more relevant now. Mr Hedges speakes from the heart of his humanity, as well as his hard won, highly educated perspective on war. I hope to meet the author one day so I can shake his hand and tell him his battle scars are a blessing to us all."
4,getting the message through,"While the book is imperfect (other reviewers have, I believe, accurately noted the limited analytical material), it is very accessible, easily read, hits key points about the human propensity to make war, and articulates some of the elements that characterize all wars--plus, his spiels about the addictive nature of war are compelling, palpable. I could feel the adrenalin rush...I have shared this book with many friends and acquaintances precisely because it is so readable. It is a reminder to all of us--regardless of our political persuasion--about the mindset that takes over when a nation goes to war. I don't think we can hear too many such reminders."
1,Pathetic Pandering to Peaceniks,War is hell. I love it. I am ashamed that I do. There it is in 12 words. Save your money.
1,"An argument, not fact","Hedges book is an argument. But many reviewers seem to think that it is fact because a New York Times reporter said it. That is not the case. The Jayson Blair scandal at the Times proves that Times' reporters are no longer presumed to be credible. Whether Hedges' argument is persuasive is doubtful. In May 2003 at Rockford College in Illinois, the audience booed Hedges off the stage because he spoiled the graduation ceremony by presenting an antiwar and anti-American speech at the graduation ceremony. Many readers will react to this beek in the same way."
1,Perfect example of the today's liberal 'journalist',"Although I read this book with an open mind, I quickly learned that Mr. Hedges is not surprisingly just another ivy-league liberal elite journalist. While our leaders like President Bush have to make the hard decisions and support our brave men and women in uniform, those like Hedges critique from the background. He seems to come from the same mold as the ivory tower activist pro-homosexual judges who wreak havoc on our justice system. I saw Mr. Hedges interviewed on PBS and was not at all surprised to learn that he supported Kerry in the last election. That alone tells you how far out of touch this guy is with American values. Spend your time supporting our courageous troops before you delve into this book. I would reccommend other authors such as Ann Coulter or Andrew Sullivan well before Hedges."
4,"Very good book, well written, voice a little dry","The only problem I had with this amazing book, was the low, dry, monotone voice of the author/narrator. His experiences are truly amazing. He does a very good job of describing war in it's entirety. He describes the 'myth' of war and the tools leaders use to wage war. The descriptions are very detailed and even a little graphic at times. But I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to better understand war."
2,What a disappointment,"- The songs are not extended -- they are just played slowly, maybe with an extra measure or two thrown in.- The singer sounds like an old, tired smoker, nothing like on the studio albums of the past.However- The musicianship is top-notch- The audio quality is better than I expected (which was a recording from 20 or 30 years ago). I would have taken a performance from their prime with average production instead."
2,WATCH OUT,"This game is a little boring.The fight engine is slow and dull.No awesome moves.Tekken is WAY better,even little big planet is more fun.........."
4,Worth tweny bucks,"Not a great game, but very good and definitely worth a twendo.Highly recommended to those with fight sticks"
3,FUN FOR A WHILE,I AM NOT A FIGHTING GAME FAN BUT IT IS OK I EXPECTED MORE ON THE GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY BUT IT IS ALRIGHT FOR ME I GOT IT USED FOR LIKE 8 DOLLARS SO I CAN'T COMPLAIN BUT I WOULDN'T BUY IT NEW
3,Fun But Lacks Competitiveness!,"Virtua Fighter 5 is a great game but it lacks the online feature especially for an next-gen console. Compared to VF4 it's a huge step up, but I preferred the VF4's style it was somewhat more entertaining. It does have stunning graphics as promised. Lots of customizations with bolts and screws for you to play with. It may not be a must have but instead a ""Good To Have""."
3,Score 8 for Virtua Fighter 5,"scored an 8 and a half ????!!!!!!! , Come now, but if this game is very good, but it still exceeds Tekken5 or Soul Calibur IV."
2,Fun for about 5 minutes,The game play is fun until you finish it the first time...then you realize how bad the controls are and how hard it is to learn the moves. I pretty much traded it out within a couple of weeks.
4,First BLOCKBUSTER on PS3!!!!,"This game is great overall. As a long time fan of Tekken, I must admit I came in very skeptical, even hated the game after the first hour or so, however, after playing it more and giving it a legitimate chance, I'd recommend it to anyone.What's Good:A good array of fighters, each one very unique, you never feel like Fighter X is just a palette swap of Fighter Y.Physics engine is finally at a point where the game is not an absurd juggle-fest, this has been my biggest critique as long as I've known about the game.Grapplers can actually grapple! Thanks to ""buffering"" and 0-frame throws the game is not rediculously unbalanced between the strikers and grapplers.Graphics are spectacularGreat variety of arenasThe Bad:Characters do not have storiesNo FMVsA.I. ranges from rediculously easy to rediculously hardIt takes forever to unlock itemsOverall, I highly recommend this to PS3 owners, but I will be honest, once Tekken 6 comes out I probably won't play this as much."
1,yawn...,"What a waste of a game. The modes suck, no online, difficult for newbies/friends, and playing alone the game has very little attributes that make it worth the money. WOw, great graphix, if you enjoy sitting around playing with yourself might enjoy for a little while."
2,"Great Graphics, Thats it!","I bought this game thinking wow, finally a good PS3 game. The graphics blew my mind, but then I started playing. The 1980's style d-pad controls along with no online play makes this a rent only game. If you have to buy this game go to online auctions and save yourself some money. I have to say this is just as disapointing as the PS3 launch."
2,meh,"Something about this game made it feel dated, and not in a good 'classic' way either. Gameplay is slow and often boring. The graphics are very nice and this game can play at high resolutions if you have a nice TV. They released Tekken: Dark Resurection on the playstation store for download, and its a better game for less than half the price of VF5."
1,Virtual Fighter 5,I'm sure the game is great atleast good but since I have yet received my game I wouldn't know. After sending a couple of e-mails to Amazon and Hi-Def to inquire about my game and getting no reponse I feel ignored and fustrated so I think the only recourse I have is to no longer purchase anything else from Amazon
5,Fun game!!,"Im a woman, well young women in my 20's and I bought my hubby this game for the heck of it. We were surprised at how fun it is. Dont know too much about the combo moves or anything but I know I did a few playing against him. It is ""Teen"" rated so there are skimpy girl fighters and some violent scenes or scary looking characters for the young kids but overall its a pretty fun game."
4,Awesome,this game is awesome.. at first i tought it was boring and hard to play then i went to the dojo section to train and within a week i rank up to 6 dan...
4,Decent game ^_^,"Pretty good game, the graphics, the sound, and the areas is awesome. The only problem is there is no ending for the characters, but it still a cool game."
4,Good Game,"This game is excellent in graphics, sound, realism, but, i disliked the game modes, I mean, there are not a lot of ways and modes to play, only in versus (two player), the single, and a carreer that is not so easy to understand. I did, like in an hour. Everything else is great, I recommend it if you like a fighting game"
3,No online gaming No Analog Stick Control,Playing with computer becomes boring after a while. No online gamingand no analog stick support. They could have done a lot better for a 60 bucks games. The only thing great about is graphics.
2,Huh no Multiplayer!!!!!!,This game would have been alot better with Multiplayer. But having no Multiplayer makes the game become a low score.
2,Amazing graphics........and nothing more!,"I would have thought that after 4 versions of this game, that SOMEONE would have thought about the controls.....or gameplay, in general.....The good:The graphics are great! Vivid colors, smooth action sequences, nice fighting moves...etc etcThe bad:Controls SUCK!"
3,How to overcomplicate a video game...,"This is the perfect example of how to make a game more complicated than it has to be. For a while I thought the Mortal Kombat games had the award for needlessly complicated. this just takes the cake, I mean you literally have a 'frame' system to work with, I mean come on, some of the moves in practice mode are just perplexing, you could be doing the combination perfect and it will just not execute. There is no story, no online, however the graphics are superb. And the computer, well someone already said it, either ridiculously easy, or ridiculously tough. Play the tekken game, this one isnt really worth more than 30 bones."
1,Worst pieace of junk of a game,"This game was terrible, the gameplay was hard the storymode sucked, the combos are terrible, and it's real boaring. This game was a massive breakdown after virtua fighter4 evolution that was the best virtua fighter game but this was a waste of time and money. The customization is not that good, the 2player sucked, the movement is a little to heavy, i perfer dead or alive4 cause thats more lighter and the attacks are more eaiser then this trashy game. The training did'nt help much just some attacks but then after awhile it was a waste of time being that its hard to even use the great combos, the graphics were good but thats really it. Theres no new characters there all from virtua fighter4 evolution the stages are the same and theres not much to do in this game, so this was a terrible game."
4,Best Fighting Game -No Doubt!!,"Virtua Fighter 5 has blown me away...the graphics , the intricate moves unique to each character and most important ..the compulsory training one must under go before venturing out continue to make this fighting game the best one out there. Like a previous post stated...this is not for the button mashers, quick wamm bamm thank you mamm crowd..this game actually requires patience and discipline..the closest elements to Virtual Fighting one can get in the world of Gaming.LOVE IT!!!"
3,Virtua 1-2-3-4-5 all the same,"Just for the graphics I can say this game is not the same as the rest, but in gameplay is the same thing, I got bored really soon, better bought Smash Brawl for wii instead of this one, eventhough this was a great bargain when I bought it at $10"
1,amateurish effort,Somebody just cut-and-pasted jokes together. Many were repeated and there seemed to be no organization.Don't waste your money
1,"""The Email Jokes You Wish You Would Have Saved""","A prior review said -I cannot believe how many spelling errors and typos there are in this book! The copywriter should be fired!Even the short title of the book contains a glaring grammatical error. ""The Email Jokes You Wish You 'Would Have' Saved"". Please."
1,THE NAME SAY'S IT ALL,"For a film called UNSPEAKABLE they sure do alot of talking, what a waste of two fine actors, Dennis and Lance, could only feel sorry for them as the film just dragged on and on,I did end up fast-forwarding and the film was still too long, only two scenes worth mentioning and they both involve brains, (ones at the very beginning and the other towards the end)at least the fx artist knew what he was doing, too bad the producer and director did'nt give him enough to do!"
1,Don't bother wathcing this one,"This movie really was not a good one. It sounds like a good psychological thriller, the cast is decent, but the movie is just not that good, there are many other great hosptial-prison thrillers, like Gothika. This is no match for Silence of the Lambs. The ending is dumb and it makes no sense at all. The gory effects are over the top, almost all of it is blood which is red and obviously fake. The lady that plays ""Diana"" is a good actress though. Save your money!"
1,"A great idea, but...","Because I've heard excellent things about the actor/director of 'Unspeakable,' I hate to give it a low rating. But I was sorely disappointed at the lack of plot development. The idea behind the film, that of unravelling the mystery behind a twisted serial killer's mind, is compelling. However, none of the film's elements receive enough attention. The acting is good, but the script contains predictable and uninteresting dialogue. I expect a psychological thriller to engage my mind. This film fails to delve deeply enough into its plot to do that."
3,"A Good Movie That Makes You Go, Huh?","I actually enjoyed this movie to my surprise. I thought it'd be B-movieish but it wasn't. The plot was way over-done for a Sci-Fi flick. I'd say the acting and soundtrack made this movie. Dennis Hopper was pretty much the no-talent actor in this. I found it sickening yet probing. It made you think. How do you define evil? The villain is a monster, but hey he doesn't deny it. He doesn't know what he is really. Sure he has supernatural powers but at the same time there is this search for an end to his madness. He is what I'd call a lost soul looking for someone to understand his need and help him. If your into movies that are character studies this is for you. If not, try Hannibal."
2,"""i need backup!""","i saw this film with my parents and we were expecting a good full scary film, you know, with dennis hopper and all but we got this weird jumble that got off topic and didnt give enough info. plus they had to show dennis tearing off his face, maggots in a brain, and the disturbing scene when the felon/murderer was severly electrocuted. without hopper's performance, this film wouldnt have made it very far"
1,"""Unspeakable"" Falls on Deaf Ears","...and flat on its face...Dennis Hopper's that is. If it weren't for Dennis, this film would have deserved falling stars. The gore is in abundance...if you like the sight of brains, oozing blood...skin being pulled off one's face...a buzz saw doing a labotomy...and creep crawlers (namely brown and yellow worms) slithering out of brains. The best acting job is by the worms...if you get my drift. Granted...Mr. Hopper is first class...but what compelled him to do this film (must've been a tough first quarter of the year and he needed the extra $50). If you want to see Hopper at his best, go rent/buy ""Blue Velvet"", Tarantino's ""True Romance"" or the little known ""The Apostate"". Further insult to injury comes with its near 2-hour length. Gosh...I should have given my dog a bath and mowed the lawn. This one's only for the Hopper fans. He really does a great job as ""The Warden"". Other than that, lock this flick up on death row and send it to the electric chair."
2,Unspeakable is Unbelievably boring.,"It sounded like it would be cool, a shrink with a brain machine that could tell if criminals awaiting execution were actually guilty or not by reading their brains. Unfortunately the script is not well written, characters and their purpose are unclear, the acting is choppy and direction is none existent. It's kind of like the X-Files, you get drawn into the story, but lose interest when you realize that nothing will be answered for the simple reason that the writers and directors would rather be cute instead of telling a story."
1,This movie is unspeakably ...,"so bad!!!! Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing...bad everything!!! The movie is talking about the antichrist and God, and all through the movie I kept on saying ""Oh, God, oh my God...."" It was so bad I was speechless...It was soooo bad I couldn't even see the end of movie...It was so bad it ruined my whole week!!! Aaaaarrrrggghhhh...don't even borrow this movie even it is free...This movie should be played only, and only when you need to torture someone!!!!! I would need counseling after only watching part of this movie. Curdled milk seems fresh compared to this movie!!!!!"
1,Just aweful,"I am usually able to watch a movie and if I don't like it, watch it again with another perspective in mind and usually am able to at least enjoy them a little. I tried watching this 3 times and just didn't like anything about it. Our characters here are just not convincing. I'm not saying the acting is bad but the movie in general is bad.If you want a good B movie about a serial killer that gets into our doctors mind, see The Ugly. For a low budget film made in New Zealand, it blows away Unspeakable.Look up trailers of this movie first before watching it all. Trust me. I bought this because it was $5 in my local store. I never thought I'd miss $5 so much."
3,Straightforward exposition with little analysis,"This DVD gives a good overview of videogames, but offers little in the way of history, sociological and psychological analysis, or even the science behind the games. If you just want an overview of what some games are and roughly when they showed up, it's great, but if you want to know the deeper questions - who, how much, why, gender, industry, education, trends, etc. (in other words, the really interesting parts of videogames), you might not get satisfactory coverage from this DVD. Given the high price, I find it a, well, ""high price"" to pay for what you get. The KCTS video ""The Video Game Revolution"" is much more satisfactory in those deeper areas. But still, this is a good introduction."
2,"A passable look at video games, if you are bored.","If you are a fan of video games, this is a look at video games. Nothing especially insightful or interesting. Maybe something to play on the tube while you are doing your homework or ironing."
3,Loss of Biodiversity,"The book deals with the multi-dimensional aspects of the loss of biodiversity. Where biologists consider loss of biodiversity generally as the reduction in the number of species in an ecosystem due to habitat fragmentation, unsustainable land use and related subjects, this book puts loss of biodiversity in a wider perspective. Issues as the ethical perspectives, environmental economics, politics and policymaking, and international cooperation on the loss of biodiversity are raised. All issues are illustrated by examples from practice. Unfortunately most examples are from the U.S., where the majority of the biodiversity hotspots lie in the tropics. The topics raised above might work out differently in these regions of the world. Nevertheless interesting subjects to consider when studying biodiversity and it's rapid loss of it."
5,A Modern Poet Amongst Us,"Circumstantial Voiceby Ginger MeederA poetry book that's eminently approachable, ""Circumstantial Voice"" has something for everyone.The poem entitled ""A Childless Woman's Cries Unto Heaven"" is an astounding and moving piece of art. I'm very visual, and I could see the poet's pain.Some of the Haikus are like a punch in the stomach:""Torments of a Homeless Man""pained eyes peirce through cappiss runs down his frozen legwarmth for a momentThere are many wonderful poems and photographs in this book. My favorite photo is of the poet on her bicycle as a child in the 1970's.For a long time, I avoided poetry, but this book breathes life back into the artform. It scratches at your soul. The wide variety of styles and emotions in Ginger Meeder's poetry book provide fuel for thought.There is humor and heaviness. Perfect for the living. It will be read again and again."
4,Only hearts chair and ottoman,"I play with this myself. I think because of the OHC dolls' anatomy it's a little bit of a challenge to sit the dolls properly in the chair. However, when you get the doll set up it's tons of fun. I like to sleep in my recliner, and I imagine that me and my dolls are having a slumber party. I dress them in jammies and put them in slipper socks, and even put on them the little sleep mask that comes with one of the OHC princess pajama sets. They get pizza, chinese food, you name it. I wish I had a daughter to play with so I could justify this, but alas I have no children."
5,colorful doll house furniture,these pieces are adorable and very colorful. My grandkids love playing with it in my dollhouse.
4,An unforgettable account of children's struggle for survival,"I have read and re-read this book. Never before did I realize what hidden children went through to survive. It is assumed that they were safe in homes, attics, or barns and far removed from the fears of other children in worse circumstances. However, this is untrue. These children had to, in many cases, hide their identity, learn whole new life stories and names, and sometimes even religions. They had to worry about family they may never see again, and their own possible discovery or betrayal. It is a testament to their courage that they survived and have gone on to live honorable lives, even while still struggling to deal with all the psychological ramifications of such a life in their formative years. A wonderful read that would be good for young people as it does not bog down in technicalities."
4,Great Music,This film has some very nice music. My 2 year old and wife both find the movie very relaxing to watch.
2,sergi,Two questions:First:Why amazon is not available in spanish?Secon.The DVE Tales of Wonder. Music and animation classics is for Region 1 (USA & Canada).I ask for the product in Spain.I can see!!I wait for an answerGratefulySergi SalgadoBarcelona-Spain
5,Not a fan of poetry BUT........,"I'm not a big fan of poetry, so I was surprised by how absorbed I have become in reading Ms. Mintzer's work. I find each poem to be a mini experience, and each experience is compelling and intriguing. The author subtly guides the reader to see the deeper meaning in the most commonplace events. After spending time with Natural Selections, I find myself seeing poetry all around me - even in a drop or water or a speck of dust. Thank you, Ms. Mintzer, for opening my eyes."
3,You get what you pay for,Decent book. I would have given them double the price for glossy pages and a hard cover. The information is excellent but the black and white photos are dark and hard to see. Most of the book is about the keeper's lives with a photo of the ship named for them being launched. The last chapter is about the shipyard and the ships themselves.
1,Second Worst Episode,"This episode is so bad. The first 20 minutes is bad television. Then Kirk and Sulu beam down to the planet to retrieve the evidence. This is stupid because later in the episode the crew said that once they return to the future, none of it would have happened. And then the biggest turd is the ending. It offends all logic. So, the first 20 minutes suck, the second 20 minutes was filler because it was not necessary, and the last 10 minutes make no sense. Tomorrow Is Yesterday is the second worst episode, coming right behind The Alternative Factor."
3,"Hey, what's this!","This is a very entertaining episode with one of the best ""teasers"" in the history of the series --You'll find yourself saying ""Hey, what's this! I thought this was a Star Trek episode! ""Also great: ""Kirk, I'm gonna lock you up for 200 years""Kirk (under his breath): ""That oughtta be... just about right""Fun stuff! Rumored to have been part two of ""The Naked Time""."
4,Nice Remixes,"This album remixes most of the classics and has some songs missing that we're remixed like Playas Only, Did You Ever Think & Fiesta but it is still good1) Slow Dance (Hey Mr. DJ) 10/102) Sex Me Pt. 2 (Extened Street Version) 7/103) Bump N' Grind (Old School Remix0 10/104) Your Body's Callin' (He She Remix) 8/105) I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) 10/106) Down Low (Nobody Has To Know) (Live To Regert It Remix) 9/10- It Did Better On An Explict CD7) I Wish (To The Homeies That Were Lost) 10/108) Feelin' On Yo Booty (Hypnosis no ""ass"" remix) 10/109) I Mean (I Don't Mean It) 8/1010) Ignition Remix 10/1011) Step In The Name Of Love Remix 7/1012) Slow Wind Ft.

5,Gets the Job Done,"I bought this book for my sister to take with her on a trip to Italy, and she told me it helped big time - of the conversational books that she had, this one was by far the most useful. Just Enough Italian contains lots of content, is easy to browse, and really helps with effective communication for English-speakers in Italy."
3,Just enough,Good little book - small enough to pack. Read it primarily before I went on Italy trip however. Helpful in learning a few key words and phrases.
5,Almost NOT enough,"Just enough Italian covers just about everything a traveler could want. It leaves you in fact wanting to know more, wanting to know how to say things not just to those you encounter in your travels, but with those you travel with. It makes you want to learn Italian more fully."
5,Great book for my fiance,I got this book for my fiance and he loved it!! He is actually going into Landscape Architecture but he still loves building architecture and he can interact with the book and it makes him a kid again!
5,The Architecture Park,"This book is a must for anyone interested in architecture and pop up books. What a wonderful learning tool. So sorry it is out of print. Actually having bought it through Amazon as a used book, it was in GREAT condition."
5,exceeding digital interactivity,"As a New Media designer, I appreciate the interactivity nature of this book. A book that you HAVE to turn around to read, structures you have to build, and the lighting of MY room falling through the building skeletons - all these are things that ""interactive CDRoms"" cannot offer."
5,Great introduction to architecture.,I have been a high school teacher of Engineering Graphics and Residential Architecture for 34 years. This book is a great introducer to architecture and becomes a magnificent motivator. This is a superb effort! It saves a lot of time & explains major theories beautifully. The reaction of my students to this book has been tremendous. I am really pleased with the results and highly recommend it.
2,This Isn't Enough For Me!!!,"I own several George Duke CD's and really like them all. For some reason I don't care for any of the songs up to track 11 on this one....How About You, Laid Back Sunday, and Thinkin' About You... are the best selections. Other than that this isn't enough for me!!!"
3,too much,"This collectionlacks cohesion and the great Duke spirit that shines so brightly on other releases. I wish 'Thief in the Night' would be released on cd. that one, along with 'Night After Night', are a couple of my favorites. I noticed that 'Night After Night' isn't on this list either, but other entrys such as 'Don't Let Go', 'Master of the Game', 'Reach For It"", and 'Rendezvous' are here ...and they are all GREAT!"
4,One of the great forgotten swing bands,"As even the liner notes to this CD admit, bandleader Sammy Kaye represented the squarer, more commercial end of the Big Band era, taking his cues from the workmanlike Glenn Miller, but restricting his dance music to an even more controlled, brisker, less lyrical style. It's fine stuff, though, emblematic of the times and well-packaged pop music... This generously programmed 26-track set features a wide swath of Kaye's postwar work, from 1945-50. Almost all the songs feature vocals, with lesser-known singers such as Don Cornell, Laura Leslie and Johnny Ryan, as well as the Kaydets vocal ensemble. It's not immortal, timelessly poetic music (like many of the big band records were ), but it is a nice slice nostalgia, and perfectly fine in its own right. Worth checking out!"
2,Rent it Before you Buy it. .,"As with volume 1, it could be a great anime but rent it first. If you can't watch it, it doesn't count for much. The discs don't play on all machines, same problem in the coding as the first. Bandai knows of the trouble with the discs but hasn't said anything about it or if they'll be doing anything about it. So again be warned."
5,Can Can Bunny Extra: Summer Fun,"This video actually contains episodes 4-6 of the series. If you've kept up with the storyline, this continues with the main characters taking a summer job at the beach and the feelings that Suwatee still has for Kenta. I definitely liked this series, and the involvement of Suwatee and Shuree made it fun to watch. I do wish that the series would've continued on for more episodes, especially since I started getting into the storyline, but it definitely ends on a good note. As has been mentioned with the other reviews, this is a Hentai title, so this isn't for those under 18, due to the sexual content."
4,"Entertaining, interesting. A conversation piece.","I just reviewed this book for a newspaper, because, even though it was published a few years ago, I discovered it recently and really enjoyed it. It is well put together and it has a lot of fun information for anybody who has made Florida their home and wish to discover it or show visiting friends around. It is short, to the point and funny at times. I loved it. Well done."
2,work good for a while but then not,"I was happy with the Koss collapsible headphones when I first got them, but after a couple months of use the foam pads would not stay in place (kept coming off) and shortly after that the thin cable started fraying where it comes out of the inline volume control and finally stopped working."
4,No problem until now - after 2.5 years,These were everything I looked for: cheap decent-sounding behind ear headphones that still let me hear what was going on around me at work.Only problem similar to other reports is sometimes need to adjust the volume slider to right position or one side would cut out.After having these for 2 1/2 years the cord wore out (with some help from me - sometimes I'd stand up and get the cord caught on a desk corner). I'll purchase a higher quality set next time
1,Not Worth Buying,When I received this product the only way to get both sides to work was to hit them repeatedly. Loose connection I believe. Not worth it to try and return them. Threw them in the trash can and bought a better pair at a local retailer.
2,Poor Quality,"I've gone through two pairs of these headphones, and won't be buying them again. On each pair, the ear cushions were too big for the earpiece, and fell off easily, which gets quite annoying. Much worse though, was that after about a week of use, the jack started doing this funky thing wherein it would play at a lower volume, or only in one ear, unless it was rotated to exactly the right place in the headphone outlet (testing with other headphones confirmed that the problem was indeed with the headphones, not the walkman.) Though the behind the ear style and folding ability was nice, it wasn't worth these annoyances."
4,great headphones,"For Christmas last year, I got a new CD player and I did not like the company's headphones so I bought this set at a local borders. Despite what the other reviewer has said, particularly about the ear cushions, my experience with these has been very good to excellent. I really have had no problems with them except for the fact I can't get the two sides to clip together anymore, but that is completely my fault. It delivers very good sound quality, has almost no distortion, and is very comfortable."
1,Just don't,"Usually, KOSS makes a good quality product at an inexpensive price.This time, they must have laid-off the quality control guy.An increase in volume is just an increase in treble, no boost in bass. Might as well stick with the sub-par ear-buds your device came with than use these."
5,Decent set of headphones for the money.,"These are a decent set of headphones for the money. I can't speak for others, but they sound good to me. I also recommend the headphone case."
1,Aches and Pain,"Purchased the headphones in June 2009; so had used them for more than 12 months.+ Like +The sound response is adequate.- Not -The neckband is poorly designed and pinched the ears and head to a really uncomfortable numbing pain. So much that even if the headphones produce good sound, it is a moot point.Not recommended to others."
3,Fits well but sounds kind of tinny,"I like the look and feel of these headphones but when I plugged them into the Nano, I was surprised that there was so little there. I have had headphones in the past that were smaller and of similar size but they had much more fidelity. I found myself wishing that the Nano had Bluetooth so I could use my good old Sony headphones on it.Koss has always been a respected name in audio but I don't think I would blindly buy another headset without listening to them first."
2,Skip This One,"This is the album that almost ended his career. Warner Bros. and Tiny Tim himself are embarassed with this album.Its released on an indie label Bouquet records.Tracklist1.Oh, How I Miss You Tonight2.Let Me Call You Sweetheart3.On The Good Ship Lollipop4.Secret Love5.Animal Crackers6.Indian Love Call7.Don't Take Your Love From Me8.If I Didn't Care9.You Make Me Feel So Young10.I Got A Pain In My Sawdust11.Be My Love12.Toot Toot Tootsie (Goodbye)Tiny Tim said this was the worst record ever made! It was recorded at a club in Greenwich Village in 1962 and was almost released under the name ""Darry Dover & The White Cliffs"""
5,Fantastic purchase!,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item! I ordered it as a gift for my son and his girlfriend and just saw it this weekend (she had admired a larger one that we have in our home). It is very substantial, not cheap plastic - it is actually quite heavy, which gives it a nice feel. It is not huge, but will look great on a smaller wall. They plan to put it in their entry way, which will be perfect. I was happy to have found this item and as a gift, it really seems much more expensive than it is! You will not be disappointed! And...it's good for Feng Sui! :)"
4,good quality,I bought this mirror to hang in my entry in a small space at the bottom of the stairs. It looks more expensive than it actually is and I've received numerous compliments from visitors.
3,El Deseo en Otono(1972),"El Deseo en Otono(1972) is a drama/horror/mystery film starring Maricruz Olivier and directed by Carlos Enrique Taboada. Olivier plays Elena, a chemistry teacher who has to deal with two spiteful students and a verbally abusive, insane mother. She endures happier times as her ""hippy"" friend moves in with her and she finds a good looking boyfriend. For some reason, the opening credits have a mellow English language song. Carlos Enrique Taboada makes us feel just as schizophrenic as Elena. Are people trying to harm Elena or is all this madness just in her mind? El Deseo en Otono is similar to Carrie(1976) and Psycho II(1983). The only extras on this DVD are a video spot for another film and a chapter index. El Deseo en Otono is hardly a simple good guys vs. bad guys story. Olivier plays a predator in this film. In one scene, the director films a spider in front of Elena's face. El Deseo en Otono is a solid film from 1970's Mexico."
2,Doesn't make me yearn to put on my tap shoes,"Although the tape provides a good introduction, its production values are not particularly appealing. It was much shorter (30 minutes compared to 90 minutes) than another tap dancing tape I purchased, and taught fewer routines. It also went on too long on basic steps. It features a dance demonstrator with an off-camera teacher's voice--a less attractive teaching method, I think."
2,"Beautiful dancer, please turn around.......","Because the dancer is facing the audience, the learner is always on the wrong foot or struggling to dance opposite her. Additionally the tape is too short for the money. Mr. Le Tang's instruction, however, is quite clear and the dancer is a joy to watch, if all you want to do is watch."
3,Almost 50 and might be able to dance,"I was so excited to get a tap video ... I had never tapped danced before, but I still found the tape helpful. I had to stop and practice on my own and then played the tape again in order to catch on. I still enjoy getting the basic steps down from the video. I have one more tap video ordered and anxious to compare."
2,No Lyrics!,"I bought this book hoping to learn a few folk songs to play for my daughter. Unfortunately, without yet more work on my part, I can't do that. The arrangements for guitar are very good, and will satisfy many levels of players. However, THERE ARE NO LYRICS! So I can't just open the book and play along and sing. Am I really supposed to know all the lyrics to ""Go Tell Auny Rhody"" and ""Never Said a Mumbling Word""? Would it have been too much trouble to add the lyrics along with the music? My advice is, don't buy this book."
4,ARCADE FUN FOR BARGAIN PRICE!,"After Burner: Black Falcon for the PSP is a blast to play, perfectly suited to the PSP's pick-up-and-play style of gaming. Not to complicated, fun, and great in short bursts. Just like the PSP (I have an Xbox 360 for the hardcore stuff), right? After Burner: Black Falcon is like a trip back to when arcades ruled video games with its simple and exciting game play. With Amazon's amazing price, this is a can't miss steal!"
4,Fast paced fun,"Another great game translated over to the PSP; if you only have a short time to get into some great gaming, this game is pretty good. Graphics are nice and gameplay is easy."
2,Not very good,This game is a fast action air combat game. Its too fast and you just end up button mashing. I'm not that impressed. I bought this game hoping it would be similar to Ace Combat which seems to be very difficult to get a hold of on the PSP.If I had rented this game before playing I would not have bought it. Even at $10.
4,"Not your classic-style After Burner, still solid fun.","Regardless of what the back of the game says, this game isn't exactly arcadey-feeling in the sense that it's not as fast (not exactly a big deal), not straightforward (you're still on rails, but now there are goals to accomplish), and weapon/engine/exterior upgrades can be bought. It's also American developed, as in the case with most current entries for older series. Still, I would recommend it at it's current bargain price and it definitely feels like a game with a good home on the PSP. It's a great mindless game for long waits in airports or in public transportation (if your city is blessed with that)."
2,Not the best game out there.,"This game provides high vacuum suction, and I am being kind. It stinks like a water reclamation facility. I would have rather have had the game just burst into flame when I opened the packet. Just take the money you are thinking about spending for this game and light it on fire, you will be better off, or give it to the homeless, a relative, a stranger, whatever."
3,good for sweet valley fans,"The first Sweet Valley Saga told the story from one side of the family,this one tells the other.Ancestory is always interesting so find out about all the people who made Jes and Liz what they are."
4,Superb music and excellent performace,"I took a risk. This is Handel's first opera, written while he was still a teenager, learning his craft. I had not heard of the opera before, but the price of the 3 cd set was very attractive and, inaddition, the performance was directed by Andrew Lawrence King -- who has a wonderful reputation for bringing colour and imagination to any score. I could not have been more delighted. The recitatives -- normally the things I dread -- are full of variety, colour and invention -- harps, harpsichords, theorbos etc. The singing is mostly very good - but at this time Handel's writing was still very 'instrumental' and not always kind to the voice. But above ll, I was delighted by the MUSIC. This is definately one not to miss. The recording is very good, the price is excellent and will convince you -- without any doubt -- of the genius that was Handel ( and IS Andrew Lawrence King)."
1,Not the book I expected...,"To be fair, I've been using InRoads for a little while now and consider myself an average user who only knows what he needs to know to get his job done. I bought this book along with the Zen Guide to help me expand my understanding of InRoads beyond my present level. The contents of this book are way too `cookbook' for my tastes and it doesn't explain enough about why some settings are defined a certain way. The book just says to do it, but I'm interested in knowing why. I've also found, based on what I already know, that some of the instructions and tips in this book are misleading and incorrect. It's not about the cost of the book, but at only 250 pages, the full explanation about how InRoads works just isn't there."
4,Worth reading,"Although this book has its flaws (namely placing Gillian at the heart of every single thing that happens to Macbeth) this book was still definitely worth reading. I loved the descriptions of medieval Scotland, and the castles and the lives of the kitchen staff. It inspired me to reread Macbeth which I hadn't done for at least 10 years, and it really served to ""flesh out"" the story. I recommend it highly--especially to any Shakespeare fan."
1,Gritty!,"This has a really gritty texture and tastes terrible. I had high hopes because the apple oatmeal is FABULOUS. Sadly, this is not!"
2,Bleh. Not a fan,Had this for lunch today. I did eat it so I guess it wasn't completely inedible but it smelled and tasted a lot like cardboard...I LOVE the black bean with lime soup though. Yum!
2,Gritty and Gross,"I bought 2 varieties of Dr McDougall's dried soups, the black bean and lime, and the tamale. The tamale soup is crazy gritty and gross. You can let it sit and rehydrate as long as you want and stir forever, and it is still like eating a mouthfull of tortilla chip flavored sand. I went back to the bean soup just to make sure my stirring technique was correct, then tried one more of the tamale. Nope, still gritty and gross. If you can get past that though, the flavor is alright. My boyfriend's son tried it too. I found it in the fridge with one spoonful missing. He said he put it in there ""in case anyone else wanted it"". Yeah right. Straight into the garbage."
5,Love this soup!,"I like the McDougall's soups!They are all low, low FAT!Great if watching your Blood cholesteral I have it all the time"
2,Just okay,The soup is okay. It would be much better without the chips. They have an odd flavor and they mush up with the rest of the soup. I won't order this one again.
2,tamale Mc Dougall product,not one of my favorites though the other soups are better and I like them.. Maybe some would like it.
5,SOOO good!,"I agree with the reviewer that said ""Ugly but good"" I love the flavor but the color and consistency make it look ugly. If you aren't picky about what your food looks like then buy these they are sooo good!"
4,Short Chain but otherwise Great Product,This products works perfectly the only reason it would give anyone trouble is because the chain is a little short.Take off the old hook off of the old chain that you are going to discard and attach it to this new chain. Set up the chain as it was with the old hook and it will fall right into place. It works great stopped the leak and only cost me 3 dollars. Really easy to do. thanks!
1,it didnt fit my toilet,I was very disappointed about this product because it didnt fit my toilet. it even leak more water than my old one I had over 20 years.
3,Toilet flapper works as expected,"This device works as expected. You can find the same thing in a good hardware store, but I live in a small community. So my choices are limited. Shopping on line for this item was easy and I got what I expected and needed."
5,The Upside-Down Kingdom Review,"The book, The Upside-Down Kingdom, is an excellent book. I would highly recommend it. I also would highly recommend your services. You, again, were very prompt and very accurate in your response. Thank you. Agnes Goertzen"
5,"If you like Kraybill, you will love John Howard Yoder","Kraybill won the National Religious Book Award in 1977. His accomplishment was putting into layman's language the insights of John Howard Yoder in ""The Politics of Jesus"", still in print.If you are prepared to go deeper into the question of actually *following* Jesus, not just worshipping him, it is Yoder you want to read next. Thanks to amazon.com for offering a reduced rate on buying ""The Upside-Down Kingdom"" and ""The Politics of Jesus"" together."
5,Best Book I've read,"There's many reasons why I'd call this the best book I've ever read, aside from the Bible. Kraybill's writing style is informative, and engaging, you really learn a lot of history, right along side of the philosophy. You can't go wrong with this book."
1,Not as good as others in this line,"My boys were very excited to get this mooing tractor but it just didn't work as well as the other CARS characters in this group. The sound was inaudible and parts were very breakable (smoke stack, side mirrors)."
3,great toy,This product is very cool. For all of you who have a child that loves the tipping tractors this was great. We have bought two different kinds and they are both great. this one makes noise and tips but it is tricky to get it to tip every time. we have figured it out and so has my 3 yr. old son! Worth the money and the excitement from our kid!
2,Pieces broke off the first day!,"My son has been wanting this tractor for months, this was his potty reward and it broke the first day. Okay not the whole thing but the exaust pipe and rear view mirror broke off. My son is very careful with his toys because he doesn't like it when something breaks. And now he will not play with it because it broke. It is a very cute tractor but not the one we were expecting. There is another version of this tractor that you press the exaust pipe to make it tilt. It is much better."
2,"grainy, cheesy, throw together to make a few bucks","don't buy - just a bunch of old clips so grainy you can hardly make them out. - a lot of irrelevant material is thrown in to complete a whole disc - I already threw away disc 1, I suppose I will watch disc 2 & throw it away afterwards"
3,Misses the mark.,"If you are looking for a movie of the caliber of ""Jeremiah Johnson"", this is not it. Although this movie has all the makings of a good one, it never puts it all together. Seems amateurish and forced. Even the musical score just doesn't fit. Hate to sound negative but unless you are buying this for a younger person, you will probably be disappointed. I admit that I have read good reviews that rate ""Hawken's Breed"" in the top three western movies of all time. But those review must have been written by the cast or their family members. Nice try, but no cigar!"
3,Wonderful time line....,"There are other books about Thomas More that I prefer, but I did like the wonderful time-line of his life which it includes."
1,Horrible software,"It took me 15 minutes to install Microsoft NET ...(luckily I'm an experienced computer user), half an hour to enable its macros in vain, and half an hour trying to close it. Finally I had to resort to Windows Task Manager to kill the program. What a nightmare!"
3,apa style helper,"It was very difficult to figure this product out! Once figured out it is helpful. However, the reference page will not print with your paper. The software help page state that they are working on a patch to fix it."
3,New Student writer,"A mentor reccommended this product to me. He is working on his PHD and found the program to be very useful. I am just beginning my masters, and found the program to be a bit more than I was willing to invest. Currently, my projects are collaborative and usually initiated by another class member all i have to do is add my section. This program does not allow me to go back and rework my completed document. However, if you are the only writer and the originator of a document... this program is for you."
4,APA Software,"This software is good...saves time...fill in the blank processing of documents. Only problem is that sometimes, there will be an error in a document for no real reason and then you have to start all over. Overall, good software."
1,buy APA format software online,I recommend PERRLA. It's cheaper and it works in tandem with your MS Word.Download it at www.perrla.com That's it. Much easier than this program and so so so much less expensive.
1,It Sucks!!!,This product was a complete waste of my money... I have not been able to use it since I purchased it. There has to be a better way.
1,do not buy!,This software is a piece of junk! It is cumbersome and it ate an entire paper of mine....I never could find it through Word or the APA style after accessing it multiple times without difficulty. The citations help did not match the APA handbook. Do not buy this product...it will only cost you time!
3,Update version needed,"I was disappointed, the APA was incompatible for MS Word 2007. It will work with MS 2003."
1,Demo scared me off,"I downloaded the demo, which was clunky at best. It hung when I tried to register for the full version. Several of the features were unavailable without the full, so I looked around to see where it was available. Then I read the reviews here. Now I know I should not buy this product."
1,Don't waste your money,This program does not let you view your references until you export the program. This program is not very helpful.
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"I'm studying to be a Social Worker, and this software would have made typing papers easier... had it worked. I downloaded the software to see how it worked, and not only was the demo not fully functional, but was also no uninstallable, either with the Control Panel or with System Suite. I had to delete the folder that was created when I installed the program."
2,APA Style helper 5.0 software,"Im a bit disappointed with this software. First I had to download the 5.1 addition. It would not install at first, but I did get good customer support to help with this. The program offers no information on how to format references correctly like the book does. The help section only explains how to use the program, and not that well. I had difficulty exporting the finished papers so I could email them to my instructor. When I did get it to work it had page breaks showing up. It has locked up and asked for a password but nowhere does it ever talk about this. I would have been better to buy the book and use my word program. The only thing that is helpful about this program is the reference section. I do like how it automatically formats them, but when listing it to begin with is a challenge: figuring out which category it falls into."
1,dchijellis,"Slow and cumbersome to use. Does not integrate well with MS Word, operating almost as its own software as opposed to an add-on. Online tutorials from Purdue University or the APA Style Helper book would be much more useful and not slow down your computer or cause you (trick you) into losing your work."
1,A complete waste of money,"This software added hours of frustration to the already long and boring task of writing an APA paper. I uninstalled and reinstalled it three times, paying careful attention to resetting my macros and it still didn't work. Now I just just use the APA format helper through microsoft works and my papers are formatted correctly."
1,Not at all helpful,"Do not buy, is my suggestion. Use the good old fashion way--get the manual and read it."
4,Behind the Scenes,"I worked on this movie and it truly was ahead of it's time. It was shot in 1991 with anamorphic (widscreen) 35mm cameras. The sound design was different than any movie up till that time and probably since, in that surround sound is almost always the 'gravy' of the audio meaning it has a part in the audio, but isn't as important. Well this movie dared to make the distinct digital surround channels as important as the front channels. The problem we ran into is 99% of the theaters couldn't handle the powerful surround channels that this movie had! They would crackle and distort. But when we found a theater that could handle the sound, wow, watch out. 90db of pure digital power especially with the afterburners in the SR-71.Unfortunately, only a DVD with it's discrete digital channels could show you how it's supposed to really sound. I'd like to see this release in Blue-Ray or similar. Who knows, maybe this movie will have a resurgence."
4,Very neat movie!,"A bit slow at times, but very philosophicaly stimulating. Decent effects.If you read the Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy you'll see a vauge connection... Look at the top of the toilet tank in the bathroom sceen. Funny, eh?"
1,What the H***,"After reading all the great reviews I purchased this film. All I can think of is this the same film the reviewers saw?? I was tempted many times to hit the stop button but because of the reviews, thought, ""it's got to get better soon"". It didn't. It simply ended with everone watching saying ""what happened?"" It seems to simply be a vehicle to try out some special effects. Go back and watch 2001: A Space Odyssey if you want FX."
4,"Well made, wonderfully acted.","Intelligent viewers can understand and appreciate this film without needing the over-the-top Hollywood hype (explosions and gunfire every 3 seconds). It tells a powerful story, in a very respectful way.Karl Urban delivers a genuine performance. While he has thrived as an action hero, he shows he has a sensitive side as well. Worth watching for his performance alone."
2,Police/Crime Narrative,The narrative is poorly written but makes a good police/crime story. This is a pass the time reading venture for a weekend.
2,Fragile,"These break way too easily. I thought they would last a little longer being hickery and all, but nope. Decent enough for practice sticks, I guess, though."
4,Pretty good,Overall very impressed all the sticks are good except one when did the roll test.For the price highly recommend would buy again.
1,I wouldnt buy them,"i bought these cuz i go thru sticks pretty quick and am tired of patin 7 bucks for a pair. i thought this was a good price, which it is, but i cant even play with these things. there really thick, not balanced, and really light. they feel really short but its because u gotta hold them like at half way for them to be balanced. it looks like a really good deal, but i proly wont even end up using them because i think im gunna break a cymbal. im gunna buy quality sticks for no on."
3,Too bulky and too heavy for kit playing,"The sticks are really too big, too heavy, and too inconsistent for an enjoyable bout with the drum set. All around kind of awkward, but cheap and disposable."
3,you get what you pay for!,"I thought what a great deal and it actually is for the price however a few things that should have been noted. The size of the stick i.e 2B 5A etc...picture shows wood tip... received nylon. They appear to be brand new wood so out of the whole pack 4 sticks were useable. All of the others were warped. Gave 3 stars because the nylon tips seem to be pretty well attached and stick is strong. There are no markings, but I would guess it is like a 2B nylon tip. If I was still on the road playing every night I would buy them. Now that I play once a week they last a lot longer. If you go through sticks fast anyway this is a good bargain. You get what you pay for is very true."
5,"Great price, and feel okay.","I figured I would try these sticks because they were so cheap that I really couldn't lose. I feared they would break easy or just feel awkward when playing. I've used painted stick before that tore up my hands, and thought since these were at such a low price point, that would do the same. Thankfully they didn't. Not the best sticks in the world, however for the price you can't really go wrong. I've read how others got some bad sticks, but so far all look great. I will say I'm using an electric set, and don't seem to play as hard as I normally would with an acoustic, but that doesn't mean I'm not hitting hard."
5,Great Deal.,"I placed an order for 3 of these. What can I say, 60 drum sticks (30) pairs for 36 bucks is a steal. The sticks are all somewhat the same size,I'm guessing around 5a - 5b, each pack I got had a different type. So far, the ones I haved used were of great quality. As mentioned before, these are not really the best quality out there for as far as drum sticks go, but for drummers that rock out alot and break alot of sticks this is a good deal."
2,get what you pay for,"These sticks are obviously well priced but the ones I got were these thick, heavy sticks that I guess they call ""rock"" style. One already broke in half within the first 15 minutes of play. Given their quality, I'd have to say a pair of Vic Firths may cost much more but will hold up longer and sound better."
4,"Durable, consistent, cheap","At just over a dollar a piece, these sticks stood the ultimate test: teenagers hitting buckets, pots, and tins. They are a bit thin at the tip, so I expect this is where they will break first, but after over 24 hours of aggressive use, there are no cracks, splinters, or breaks. Great beginner sticks for the price!"
3,AVERAGE,FOR AVERAGE DRUM STICKS.... THEY DO THE JOB..... SOME DISCOLORING IN THE PRODUCT BUT THEY DO THE JOB.... GREAT VALUE
1,Poor Quality,"This record player spins approximately 10-15% too fast when on the lowest setting. It's not a huge difference, but it's just enough to get annoying and ruin the music. This brand has put out multiple machines with this problem, so I would recommend getting a refund for the purchase rather than exchanging it."
2,Crosley Stack-o-Matic Record Player or Crap o Matic?,"I purchase this player hoping to relive the 70's and 80's using my old LP's. Well, the unit looks good and does have an automatic arm and a long spindle for dispensing more then one album or 45 record at a time but that's where the good stuff ends! The sound is just horrible! I don't know if it's the speaker in the unit or a poor amplifier or both but the sound is week and isn't that why you are buying it? I say go to Ebay and bid on an oldie but goodie vintage record player!"
3,Crosley Collegiate Record Player,I bought this record player about three years ago. I wasn't too impressed with the sound. It has just two small speakers on the front with little amplification. I had to modify this product somewhat to create the sound that I was looking for. I took the bottom of the record player off. I then spliced speaker wires and connected them to a sub woofer amplifier. This amp. had speaker out connections to amplify the sound to external speakers. I kept the front speakers as well for the higher end sound spectrum. Sounds more complicated than it really was. Now it plays loud and clear. It is quite hard to find a record player that has stack ability so this is the feature that I enjoy most. Now I have a great record collection and am able to listen with pleasure.
3,"Great at first, poor in cold weather","I replaced both the left and right lift supports. The name is most appropriate as these gas struts are definitely stronger than the original. That said, they are poor performers in cold weather.The original Toyota part had a service life of seven years. I doubt the Strongarm lift support will last half as long. They are about 1/3 the cost of the genuine Toyota part though."
4,FYI,"This ""A Haunting"" dvd was compiled of episodes that are in seasons 1-2, I ordered it because I've enjoyed all of the ""A Haunting"" dvds to present, but was disappointed to order this one and had already seen it, the same goes for the ""A Haunting""-The House, it had mostly duplicate episodes. So if you purchase any of the mentioned above I would recommend purchasing the complete seasons."
4,This set of DVD is entertaining and spine-chilling in some scenes but it's a waste of money,"This set of DVD is entertaining and spine-chilling in some scenes but it's a waste of money. Why? It's because it shows only 4 episodes out 38 original ones.It's too bad I did not know this before buying this set. I've ordered the whole series called ""A haunting"". It consists of 9 DVDs and it costs only thirty dollars!"
4,seems like an ok compressor,"compact, very strong magnets in motor, can be felt outside case with steel bar, compressor seems like it is well made, even being an offshore import. i've had these two pumps in service for a month and they sound good and pumps well, will update in another 6 months if still no problem.looks like this compressor could be mounted out in the elements as long as the intake port was piped to a clean location, i typically pipe these to the truck cab so it takes in cleaner and already partially dehumidized ( air conditioned) air."
1,Lacks good examples and makes learning a chore,"This book will leave you high and dry on many occassions. Gersting explains the obvious in each section with her practice problems and then throws problems that are impossible to do without an extra book at the end of each section. Unless you have a very good professor that notices and makes up for the grey areas in this book, you are in big trouble my friend. Discrete Math is a fun subject, this book makes it a total hassle."
5,Mathematical Structures For Computer Science,This is an excellent text. It is great for anyone who is interested in Computer Science. Professor Gersting covers all of the basic mathematical structures necessary for through understading of Computer Science. The material is presented on a low level initailly to facilitate understanding. The relationship between Math and Computer Science is one in which Professor Judith Gersting presents well without explicitly stating it. This book is well organized and detailed in every way. The problems presented are appropriate and timely. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have.
2,Makes a Simple things Harder than they should be,"This book makes simple things harder than they should be. It lacks good examples and explanation which makes it hard to learn some topics as the reader has no clue of how the author came with her solution.In the exercises, only 15% of the questions have solutions and are not concise enough to give the reader an idea of how to solve the harder questions with no solutions. It does contain practice questions with solutions but alot of the solutions are just answers with little description. Again, the practice questions are elementary in comparision to the exercises."
2,Big Gap in Explanations,"Each section of the book starts out nicely, but the examples jump from moderately easy to pretty tough quickly. For example, in Chapter 2.4 on Recursive Definitions, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively which is relatively easy to comprehend.After this, there is a practice problem that asks you write the first 8 number of the Fibonacci sequence. No problem.The very next question is: ""Prove that in the Fibonacci sequence F(n+4) = 3F(n+2) - F(n) for all n >= 1."" Although this problem is worked out in the book using the second principle of induction, the gap in the material is obvious."
3,Needs better explanations,"This book definitely needs a teacher who thoroughly understands the material. Should not be used as a self teaching tool. Instead of every other exercise question having an answer in the back of the book, only a few starred ones are available in each section. Also, each lesson and practice problems don't cover all the areas in the exercises. There will be some exercises for which there are no examples in the book, including symbology not explained in the book."
2,poorly written,"Where were the editors? The author presumably knows the subject well, but she doesn't write clearly and has no clue how to organize a chapter. Critical new material is introduced in the middle of ""examples,"" where it is hard to find. Explanations often assume key steps without explanation and are pitched at wildly different levels. At some times, she assumes no math background beyond HS algebra, but at others she uses symbols learned in calculus without explanation. Use another book instead."
2,Making simple things Harder,"This book lacks examples and clear explanation. It is hard to follow and has made simple things harder rather than the other way around.Only 15% of the solutions are provided for the excercises. Alot of the questions in the excercises are of a different level than those questions for which solutions have been provided. It does have practice questions with solutions for each chapter, but again, not enough explanation has been given in the book to do them and alot of times I just found myself looking at the solutions of the Practice questions and try to figure out how a problem is done."
1,First one hundred pages were a waste,"I was forced to buy this book for class. The first 100 pages have been useless for me. I can't understand why my school is using it. From this point, I'll be reading a Discrete book my wife used 5+ years ago and I'll just work the required problems in this text."
4,Great Reference Book,"If you are new to blogs or an experienced blogster, I recommend having this book on your reference bookshelf. I suggest that you refer to it often. Its a GREAT How To reference guide.I read this book before Naked Conversations. I think it should be the other way around. The most valuable part of this book is after you have a strategy and focus. Blogging for Business has a couple of chapters that are pure gold and should be reviewed continually especially the section on search engine optimization."
1,NO NO NO,"OK, if you live in a cave and know NOTHING about Blogging you might find a tip in this book. Good luck!"
5,WOW!,WOW! This has got to be one of the best country albums I've listened to in a long long time. TP's honky tonk style never lets up throughout every song. I enjoyed this album so much I purchased TP's other 2 and enjoy them just as much. I highly recommend TP to anyone looking for a unique and refreshing sound in country music. This album is excellent. Enjoy!
4,Not an introduction- a very difficult text,"This book is an excellent text on stochastic calculus. As is commonly done, the text focuses on integration with respect to a Brownian motion.However, there are several important pre-requisites: the reader must be intimately familiar with measure theory, probability theory and stochastic processes. For those new to stochastic calculus it is generally recommended to read Oksendal's book on stochastic differential equations and then come back to Karatzas and Shreve.Please be warned that even with reasonable background to probability theory and stochastic calculus, this text is very difficult to understand mathematically- it requires a certain level of dedication from the reader if the book is to be read back to back rather than act as a reference"
1,Hmmm.,"I can't tell you how insulted I was after I read this ""IQ"" test. Not only is the trivia simple, but they even got the facts wrong on some of them. They quoted lines incorrectly and attatched quotes to the wrong people. But the most unforgivable sin in the entire book would probably be the fact that the spelled Mulder incorrectly. If you consider yourself even halfway knowledgeable in the area of the X-files, this is not the book for you. Please. Don't waste your money."
2,Not for serious X-philes,"If your a serious X-phile, you'll find that most of these quizzes are nothing new. I was hoping to find questions that I could ""test"" my friends with, but most of these facts I already knew, or disagreed with the answers, with the episodes to prove it. I was dissappointed that it wasn't more in-depth."
5,A must-read for any X-Phile,"This book is one of the best books about The X-Files. Not only can you ""test"" yourself after every episode, the questions help you discover details that you never caught. It also has questions about David and Gillian. After going through this book, I found myself making up my own questions. Once again, any fan of the show should get this book to add to their collection."
4,An appealing book for toddlers,This story and its illustrations evoke the gentle magic of a snowfall. The text is rhythmic and pleasantly repetitive. Small children would love the simple paintings of familiar animals. The climactic 2-page spread has plenty for a toddler to pore over without being too busy.The language and sentence structure are simple enough to make this book useful as an easy reader as well.
5,Great for toddlers,The text is simple but flows beautifully. The art is great. My 19 month old asks for this to be read every day.
4,Toddler bed,"Well-made, looks great, solid. I ended up getting mine at a very substantial discount because the supplier shipped the wrong color and offered me a discount instead of exchanging, which was fine with me. Only 4 stars because considering the price and length of time you'll use this product, I think you can get a comparable product, either on line or at you local baby store, for a lot less money."
4,Just what I needed!,I bought these for essential oils. These bottles seem like high quality. The cap firmly seals and the dropper works great. The only drawback is that the dropper is a little too short and does not reach close enough to the bottom.
2,the cap is too flimsy,"The price is very good, but the cap is very flimsy.It breaked when I attempted to turn it.the tube is also glass which is good.the only problem is the cap."
5,Better Than Being There!,"Viewing this beautiful footage of Bali gave me the feeling of ""being there."" I could almost smell the smells and feel the warm breeze. I got a feel for these beautiful people on the island of Bali and a sense of their sacred culture and insight into the role of art and creativity there. I thought, ""I can be a world traveler without ever having to get on an airplane again!"" I am going to get all of Michael Heumann's Blu Ray Living Landscapes. The photography is amazing."
2,Possibly the most violent film ever made.,"This film is so graphic that it would be reasonable to assume that it is the most violent film ever made. It's not really a good movie, because although gory, the violence is very fake. It's rather funny though. I must warn you: If you are queasy you will vomit all over the place because this film is very bloody graphic."
5,WHERE IS THE SIX STAR RATING,"A perfect film, love, friendship, devotion to family, monkies, zombies, and priests that know karate. What else could you want in a movie. Peter Jackson puts an incredible love story on film in only a way that he can. If you can handle gore and even think it is funny GET THIS MOVIE! It's the only horror/comedy that I have seen with no nudity or bad language. This is art."
1,Too gory to be funny,"The cult film, Dead Alive, won't be for everyone's tastes, not even for certain horror-comedy fans. I loved Army of Darkness, but I was to the point of despising Dead Alive. It had certain clever moments, but too much of it was buried deep within the facade of blood and guts. Gore fans will certainly appreciate this film, but those looking for a great plot will probably be disappointed."
1,Anybody could make this movie!,"This is a movie with a horrible plot and even worse humor. I can't believe this movie has so much popularity just because it's the goriest movie ever made. It doesn't have the originality or wit of Re-animator, the hilarious hero of Army of Darkness, or a good zombie story like Dawn of the Dead. Since lots of people gave this movie 5 stars, I'm going to assume that if you love gore then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, don't even look at the cassete box."
2,Funny sometimes but then it gets plain disgusting,"The gore in Dead Alive is abundant, very, very abundant. But that doesn't necessarily make it a good film. It has some decent scenes in the beginning but then it just dissolves by the gore packed finale which basically runs out of laughs by then. For a truly good horror-comedy watch Army of Darkness."
5,I Love This One A Lot,"Great work by a fine singer and musician. My special favorite is ""No Love to Be Found"" because of its great harmonies with Wendy Moten, background vocalist. Another favorite is ""You Can't Make It Love"". It is a great blues song done as only Michael can do it! I am surprised that this song wasn't a bigger hit. I hope to see more selections like this on amazon.com. If you're new to Michael McDonald, this is a great one to pick up. Thanks Amazon."
4,Finally...,"Michael McDonald has finally put out an album worthy of one of the greatest voices in music. The overblown ""L.A."" production values that have destroyed everything he's done since ""No looking back"" are gone and instead the listener is treated to a real band with fat drums and bass, B3, guitar and soulful arrangements. Stylistically, it's much more like his great take on Jackie Wilson's ""Lonely Teardrops"" from the Rock and Soul Revue disc. His cover of Neil Young's long-forgotten ""Down by the River"" reminds you how a great singer can redefine a great song. (He could have let the guitarist stretch out a little on that one but who's complaining?) If you like MM but have been a little disappointed in his lackluster material, this is his strongest release in years."
2,MMD in Minor,"As much as I liked Michael McDonald's former CD's Sweet Freedom and Take it to heart, I hate to say, that this CD is a big disappointment. The songs are too much alike and the overall tone is dark and melancholic. So, if you prefer Major to Minor, and want to buy Michaels best CD this far, my recommendation is Sweet Freedom !"
3,Not Up to Standard,"Michael McDonald has one of the most distinctive and expressive voices of our generation. Who can forget his renditions of ""What a Fool Believes,"" ""Real Love,"" ""I Keep Forgettin,"" ""I Can Let Go Now,"" ""All We Got?"". These songs were the key to Michael's power. With ""Blue Obsession"" Michael still has the pipes but the tunes are really pretty boring. The ""blues"" venue limits his style and his creativity. Round up his earlier efforts and hear Michael doing songs that deserve his voice, instead of these run-of-the-mill tunes."
5,Blue Obsession is finally here,"I am so glad that Blue Obsession has finally been released. I am a big Michael McDonald fan, I love his voice! He has the perfect voice for the blues and gospel. Album has diverse sound. I love the cd, especially the blues sound on several of the songs. My favorite songs on the album are No Love to Be Found and Blue Obsession. I also like the way he did Ain't That Peculiar, very unique. GREAT CD!"
2,He needs to rethink the gospel bent,"I was looking forward to Michael's new cd and I must admit the lyrics are very good. However, his voice strains to be gospel'like which results in a less than pleasant experience. His B-3 Hammond is great but not featured really. On the whole Michael needs to seem less strained, loud, and obessed with over production instead of the sweet sound he can make when he tries. There are good moments but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,His weakest effort to date,"This album might have had a lot of social significance lyrically,but I'd go to Dylan or Cohen for that,if it was what I was looking for.Good changes,fresh & funky arrangements,and incredible vocals are what McDonald is known for,not predictable writing,static arrangements & melodies,and basic production.The album isn't pure dreck by any means,but for McDoobie(and Tommy Sims as well),it's regrettable and forgettable."
3,Michael's disappointment.,"If this were coming out six years ago, it would not be too bad. After seven years though, I expected more poetry and music.On this album, you'll have to wait for cut 6 to get a memorable melody, and for cut 12 to get any meaningful poetry.Not to worry, these two songs are worth the price of the album and then some!Welcome back Michael!Larry"
1,What is this?,"I eagerly awaited the release of McDonald's ""comeback"". Boy, was I disappointed!. Could hardly get through the first listen. The second listen was unbearable. That voice is still in fine form, but what has he recorded? The duets on the album are awful. This cd is definitely not up to Michael McDonald's previous work. Sounds like it was recorded in somebody's garage. Even if you LOVE his previous work, I'm telling you, SKIP THIS ONE."
2,"waited so long, what a shame","I am a classic Michael Mcdonald fan. I am old enough to have heard ""Fool"" on the radio, some of the fans that write on here are like 20 and were born during the break up of the Doobies so what do they know. This album has its good points, but mostly is a mess. Down by the river should be received as an ok track, while kikwit plain out stinks. The best song by far is ""build upon it"". Michaels voice is very strained and you can no longer hear his high notes like on the earlier hits. He is a one of a kind talent, but without finding a true hit, I fear he will continue to languish at the venues he plays at now. Rod Temperton wrote sweet freedom for him, he needs to look him up again, that was truly his last hit, or worthwhile song. There have been three albums now since 1985, none hitting higher than #90 on the charts, something has to change, not just for Michaels fans, but for his legacy."
1,Michael McDonald has lost it,"I love all his Doobies material and his first two solo albums, his subsequent recordings were below par. All of his work with Steely Dan and Christopher Cross is excellent - how can an artist of such stature produce such a crap album? This album should never have been released. His voice sounds very strained on every track and most tracks are over produced. The two voices on the opening duet don't gel very well and they try too hard to sound gospel. Pickwick is unbearable and is badly written and performed. On the positive side, there is some nice organ and guitar work on a few tracks. Unfortunately, this is not the album that McDonald fans have been waiting so long for. Perhaps a live album of his greatest hits would be good, but he needs to lay back a little and start singing again instead of this irritating strained voice throughout this album"
5,"Real Music, Real Musicians, Real McDonald","This is the kind of music that you dream of hearing live in a small room for that once in a lifetime, up close and real connection with intelligent R&B and the ""Once in a lifetime"" voice of Michael McDonald. Thank you, Michael for giving us this album. It was worth the wait."
3,Not sturdy,"For the price charged, this item should have been made more sturdier. As my child was putting on the costume for the first time, the shields on the knees started peeling off. The cloth used is too thin. He wore it for threee times and for the third time I pretty much had to stich the whole costume as the stiches peeled off. Frustrating."
1,"Beethoven, Diabelli Variations",Terrible sound. Westminster recording was delivered instead of Poligram Records #471203. Substandard recording quality.
1,One star for durability,"I agree that this is a really fun toy--my kids loved them while they lasted. We bought two for Christmas and they both broke within a few weeks, and it wasn't because of rough treatment. You can tell that they are definitely cheaply made. Too bad, the features were cool, as other reviewers have described."
3,Not for chewers,"This phone seems to cater to chewers...the antennae is knobby. While the area around the keypad is very rounded, the top (screen) part is sharp. After chewing, my son has red irritation on the corners of his mouth. Needless to say, this phone has gone in the drawer until he is much older. Yes, my son is younger than 18 months, but nothing else about this phone seems dangerous.For the phone itself: the record-your-voice function is pretty cool. It can hold an 8-second clip. The screen isn't really an LCD, just an image with a backlight. The voices and music (two 15-second songs) are very pleasant.As for reliability...we have not used this phone enough for it to fail or prove itself."
2,"Fun toy, but RECALLED!","We have this phone and have enjoyed it. There are a lot of toy cell phones on the market to choose from. I have liked all of the Parents line of toys. This cell phone looks less toy like than most. It's not really ""educational"" but it is a toy version of a real world item, and children enjoy mimicing and pretending - that in and of itself is LEARNING to live in the world around them. The record a message feature was nice. I would leave my daughter messages when I left for the day so she could still hear mommy's voice. There are many cool prints to choose from.I was dismayed to learn this toy was just recalled however. Which is unfortunate because I did like it. It looks like ones manufactured between certain dates are the culprits.[...]"
1,"Good idea, poorly made","This is a very fun toy. There are numerous buttons and sounds that my children enjoyed very much. After you close the phone, it rings a couple seconds later, and the kids loved to answer it and pretend to talk to people.Unfortunately the two I bought quit working within a short time of buying them. I bought the first one last year for my son, and it lasted for about a week. First the recording feature stopped working. Then none of the sounds worked. New batteries didn't help, I even opened it up to see if any transistors had burned out or there were any shorts. Didn't find any problems...it just refused to work.We bought a second one for Christmas 06, and it's already quit too. We'll try to stay away from this brand."
2,disappointed,"ordered this for my 18 month old, thinking he'd leave our phone alone. I thought he'd love it, but the "" record a message"" part doesn't work and it goes through batteries way too fast. Have contacted seller, and seems cooperative, but with a 3 hour time difference, and busy schedules, we can't seem to catch up to each other to resolve the problem."
2,Great for Little Kids,"I have a 9 yr old great niece that loves to have pretend phone calls with friends so I thought it would be fun to give her a ""cell"" phone that wasn't one of the baby toy phones on which she's been playing...my idea to help her grow up a little. This phone was really too young for her...it's very plastic and really geared for a 4 or 5 year old or even younger.That being said, the seller was great about accepting a return; they handled the transaction very quickly and easily for me.I would recommend this phone for a young child; it just didn't fit what I was trying to accomplish."
2,Not well made,The phone was nice and my daughter liked it... for as long as it worked. The phone just quit after less than a month and nothing brought it back to life... not changing the batteries... nothing. There are similar more durable toys that I would suggest over this one.
4,Very Nice,It was hard to choose - I really like this set but the dishes were a bit bigger then I thought. I would have liked a smaller bowl available.
4,Good quality lock!,"Seems durable and heavy duty. I use it indoors, not sure how weather resistant it is. The combination was easy to reset and I appreciate the full stop at zero."
2,worked great...for 6 months,"Used this on an outbuilding since we were always forgetting to take the key to the old lock. it worked great for 6 months, then it wouldn't open. nothing i can do to make it open except buy some expensive bolt cutter now."
1,Winning Gifts canceled order after two days,"I ordered flowers for mother's day, with 4 days to go, and Winning Gifts cancelled the order two days later, saying that cold weather and high demand had reduced their flower supply. This left me barely enough time to find an alternative. I would never order from them again. Their name should be ""Losing Gifts."" So my rating is for the company, not the item since I never managed to get it."
2,"Great optics, overall strangely awkward.","First, let me start by saying the optics in these binoculars are amazing. The sky is clear and you can see many stars I didn't know were there.That being said, the binoculars are very uncomfortable to use, and it is very hard to figure out exactly why. The ""hole"" you look through with your eyes is very, very narrow. This means you have to hold the binoculars very still with that hole directly in front of your eye. For me, that is a very awkward place to hold the binoculars---they are not against anything that would steady them (like the bone on your eyebrow ridge). Because of this, the binoculars are very hard to hold still and are quite jittery. Combine this with the narrow eye slit, and you have binoculars that are quite annoying to use and keep still."
4,A great toy for all year around,"We purchased this as a 3rd birthday gift for our daughter and she loves it. We placed it in between her toy room and the living room, so she feels like she has her own space. Plus it's really darn cute.The other playhouses were so expensive and cannot be used year around (easily), so we thought this was a better purchase.Highly recommended for people who like Step2 items and who want something different for their child."
4,"fun, but expensive","this is a really fun toy, my doughter love this, she puts mail in the door, and it is really important that we are ringing in the bell before entering her room. But buy this at walmart instead almost onehundred dollars is way to much money, as always Walmart has good reasonable prises, you save thirty dollars....;) I highly recomend this toy."
1,NOT GOOD FOR THE SHOWER,I slipped and fell with this in my shower. The little suction cups did not stick well and down I went. It is in the trash at the moment.
4,excellent product but...,"This shower mat is excellent, so soft to step on, it doesn't really get a grip on your shower floor but it doesn't slide either... just great but it took forever to get delivered!!!"
5,Cables to Go Toslink passive Splitter 27027,"Works as designed (splitter) Prefectly. Great price for what it does. 1 in 2 out. No power required, passive.It's just zeros and ones.I used it to connect the output of my Samsung LED TV to the 27027 with a 1.5 Ft Toslink cable. Split it to my Samsung Soundbar with a 3 foot cable for day to day quality listening from broadcast TV. The other split I connected to my Denon AVR Toslink input for TV with a 6 foot cable for the few times where I want real surround from broadcast TV programming.My other option would have been to use my M-Audio Midiman CO2 to do an active split but I would have to leave it powered on all the time.The cable that came with my Samsung soundbar fit very tight. Almost like it was not completly in but it workes fine."
3,"Works, with caveats","For the price, this does what it's supposed to do. The signal strength appears to be cut in half but proved to be ample enough to power my wireless headphone amp while connected to both my PS3 and Xbox 360. There are 2 main problems, however. 1) It won't auto-detect signals and ""block out"" the one not in use, so if both sources are turned on, the signal will constantly flip back and forth between the two, causing me to have to either turn off one of the devices or unplug it. This leads to: 2) constant unplugging will eventually cause the connections to fail.My suggestion is to plug it in once and leave it that way. After plugging and unplugging the sources about two dozen times so far, the connections are starting to degrade. It's almost useless now."
5,Works as advertised... but,"If you order this, or any TOSLINK splitter, you should remember that runs over 25' may require an amplifier. I have two of these in place for a HTPC setup and the signal is intermittent with the adapter in place (50' run). I added a signal amp between the source and splitter and all is well."
3,"It works, however...",even if you can feed two different outputs the signal tends to get weak so it interrupts itself with some frequency in any of the two outputs. I guess you need a signal extender to go along with it
1,Garbage,"Does not work. Tried several functional cables, both directions, all orientations. Not even close to functional. Absolute garbage. Looking at a functional cable I see 1 red dot. Legit right? Looking into either end of this thing, with a functional cable with signal plugged into the opposite end, I see two red dots. Shocking that doesn't work. Selling something this overtly function-less is either malicious or moronic. Take your pick."
1,Only One Side Would Work,I could see light going through both sides but only one side would work. As that kind of defeats the whole point of a splitter I returned it and bought this switch instead. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104XCWS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 The switch works much better.
3,Bad Signal Loss - Scratchy Audio,"I bought this so I could connect my PS3 and Xbox360 to the same receiver. Of course, they cannot both be on at the same time, but I thought this would be a lot easier than swapping the cables manually each time I wanted the other console.I'm not sure if this issue would be with the fundamental nature of optical tech, that the signal would degrade so badly after being split, or if this is just a junk splitter with a poor throughput.Eitherway.. I have tried glass cables and everything, but I cannot get a super clear signal from both consoles. There is always a faint popping sound. Games are still playable and movies are okay, but there is a lot of room for improvement."
1,No-Link Toslink,I purchased this so-called digital audio splitter to allow non-simultaneous audio connection between my Blue-Ray DVD Player and my new 3rd generation Apple TV with my older but high-end Onkyo TX-DS747 Audio Video Control Receiver that unfortunately has only one digital optical input. I have great sound with either connected alone to the Onkyo but have difficulty switching the cables when changing video sources. Too many cables and cabinetry prevent easy access. So I hoped with reservations (due to the significant poor reviews) that maybe I would be lucky and this splitter would solve my selection problem. It just doesn't work. No sound from either source. This wan't a costly mistake but a disappointing result and waste of time. I've now purchased an optical to digital coaxial cable to use in one of several digital coaxial ports available and hope this will solve the problem.New - Toslink Digital Audio Splitter Black - 27027
1,Garbage,"Bought 3. Went to split the signal from my LG LED TV to my Polk Audio Sound Bar (HT6000) and to my Yamaha Receiver to get the sound to my external speakers outside, it was a total fail and I bought 3 units, all of which failed. I am returning for a refund."
2,Doesn't Work,"I tried to hook my DVD player and DVR up to my receiver using this product. When I just have the DVR working, the sound is good, but when I put the DVD player on I get nothing. So, no, this piece doesn't work for hooking up multiple components."
1,SCAM! DO NOT BUY!!!,"I purchased this despite having read the awful reviews, hoping that it would work in my case. I wanted to use this to split up the audio from my Xbox to my receiver and to my Turtle Beach DX11 (on days when I don't want to bother the wife). It seemed to work from only one side the first time I tried it, then it stopped working altogether. This item DOES NOT WORK, this is a SCAM! Not worth the hassle trying to return it since I only paid a few dollars for this. I willl do more research and try to find an optical cable splitter that actually works and I will update this review once I do.Be warned, don't burn $6 like I did! It WON'T work for you, neither!"
1,Doesn't work,Thing doesn't work for me at all. Tried plugging everything in in different ways but it still doesn't work. Don't waste your time on this.
5,It also works the other way around!,"I used this optical splitter the opposite way as advertised. I got it to connect two digital audio outputs to one digital audio input on my home theater.I have an old Home Theater system (with a broken DVD) that do not have HDMI input, only Toslink Digital Audio input. So I used the product to get the digital audio outputs of a Blu-Ray player and an Apple TV into the Home Theater system. It works perfectly but you can only use one device at a time. Obviously you are either watching a blu-ray movie or watching Netflix on your Apple TV, but not both anyway (I have not tried it but I suppose that if both devices are on and sending audio signals to the home theater then you will get mixed signals and noise, basically).So make sure then you only use one (input) device at a time and have the other one turned off."
2,Severely degrades signal strength,"Unless you have a signal booster, don't buy this product. I gave it a try with some low-end cables and it never had a solid signal. You might be alright with higher-end cables, but mine were 1.5ft each. No-go."
1,Junk what a Waste,Needed this to split a cable and go only 6 feet to a separate device and it immediately destroyed the signal to both the short and the longer cable. I read the reviews here and took a chance....wish I didn't....
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,Ignore the bad reviews - people are clueless. This splitter is awesome. Sound quality isn't affected. Split an XBOX 360 and Sony Blu-Ray player. Would highly recommend.
2,Obviously not the best,I ran out of optical inputs on my receiver so I bought this to help. It took about 20 minutes of wiggling cables and adding electrical tape to hold cables just right for this to work. Might wanna try another one.
1,Don't waste your money,"Didn't work when I received it, tried it every way it is meant to be used, cheap POS."
1,Product Simply Does Not Work,"Purchased this product to connect a PS3 and Xbox 360 to a Bose Lifestyle system that only has one Optical Input. Each cable coming from the consoles was 6 ft long (both Monster brand) and the cable coming from the splitter to the Bose unit was 3 ft (unbranded). The product does not work. There is a signal (red light) coming from both console cables as well as from the 3 ft cable coming out of the splitter, but the receiver simply will not pick the signal up. Tried simply using it as a coupler with one of the video game consoles - still nothing. I recommend purchasing the TOSlink A/B switch. I bought this a week later and it works great."
1,I Should Have Read Reviews First,"Like 15 people before me, this product does not work at all. Looking over the reviews it seems to work for about a quarter of the people who buy it. My guess is that those of us having issues with it are using longer cables (I have to 6 ft, and one 8 ft optical cable) whereas those who don't have problems are using shorter cables and therefore less signal is lost. One would think that these limitations would be explained in the product description."
3,Sends signal but not strong enough,I wanted to use this to connect both my xbox and playstation to my home theater set up but my reciever did not pick up the signal. I could see the light coming out from the cable that was running into my home theater but it looked like it was too weak for the reciever to be able to recognize it. It seems like its doing its job but the signal gets weakened.
1,Did Not Work in Any Setup,I was going to use this item as a 2 into 1 setup with a DVR and Xbox360 going into my receiver. Did not work. I tried to use the unit as a simple pass through to see if it even worked. No good. I could get no signal to pass through. Complete Junk.....Cost of shipping item back to get a $3 refund made no sense. Item already sleeps with the fishes.......
1,Causes too much signal loss,"Too much signal loss for EITHER device connected to be able to process the digital signal, rendering it COMPLETELY USELESS!"
1,Didn't work with my sound bar/ home theater system,"Using the TOSlink splitter to split signal from tv to sound bar to Home Theater system. No sound to sound bar (TOSlink Input) or home theater system, tried different cables. TOSlink cables work, splitter doesn't. Returning for a replacement, perhaps it's a defective unit."
1,Shipped quick but dosn't work so....,I bought this to minimize the difficulty connecting my laptop to my Home stereo system but it just don't work. I fully assumed I did something wrong but there are only two ways to connect this thing and neither passed a useful signal.
1,Worthless,I found the signal attenuation on this device to be so great that it didn't work in either direction for any of my digital devices. Cable length didn't appear to make any difference as mentioned in another review. The only good thing I can say about it is that it was cheap enough that I could just toss it in the garbage rather than take the time to send it back.
1,Doesn't work well...,"I am using this item as intended....as a splitter, not as a combiner as some people are.My main complaint is that the splitter degrades the optical signal too much. The cable jacks are tight and work well, it's just that signal isn't strong enough unless you use a booster. I'm using good quality cables, with short 1m runs so splitting it should not require a booster."
2,It can work - sometimes,"I tried one of these to get an additional optical input on my HTiB to connect two TiVos at once. It's fiddly, but it can work.1) The optical cables have to be polarized in the same direction. The sockets on this thing have a key on both sides. Try one source at a time and flip the connector 180 degrees until you hear it. You can mark your cable to indiacte which way to line it up.2) ONLY ONE source can be on at a time. You can't have have two live active signals at once. I was able to get by by putting my inactive TiVo into standby mode.If your application can turn off the unused source this can work fine for you.In the end I decided that it was too much hassle and I've got this device out of the loop."
4,"Great price and quality, unfortunately",This did not work for what I wanted to do which was run a 360 and PS3 to one reciever. It might be my reciever as I know other people have been able to do this. On the upside it only cost me 3.00$ so not a major loss and I'll probably use it for something else down the road. By the way I have a Panasonic 5 disc changer 1100 watt home theatre surround sound system with Ipod dock so if you have the same system it might not work for you as well. 3$ isn't going to end your life though.
1,Don't waste your time/money,"DOA. I was looking for a passive Toslink splitter like this, but this didn't work at all. I tried hooking up each device one at at time testing each input and it did nothing. It's not worth the cost of shipping to send it back. DO NOT buy this product. This company is making money off of a phony product because they've priced it in such a way that most people won't bother to pay more to send it back!"
1,"May work, but did not for me.","This is a simple product that splits the optical signal from two accessories in to one digital receiver or splits the signal from one accessory in to two receivers. I am sure for a lot of people this product will work great for them, but for myself I ran in to a problem.Too use this product you can't have a signal coming from both units at the same time. In my case I was trying to hookup a DirecTV Tivo and a Panasonic DVD recorder to my Sony Reciever. However, I quickly ran in to a problem because while the Tivo would turn off its Optical transmitter when put in standby, the Panasonic would not."
1,DO NOT BUY,so it didnt work... i gave it 1only because i couldnt give it 0 stars...i cracked it open...and it reallly doesnt work... the craftsmen ship is terrible...it was shrink wrapped...with some shotty fiber inside(different sizes)...they didnt line up in the holes that they were supposed to split to...just get a optical to coax convertor...it worked 100% ...this thing...worked 0%
1,Did not work for me!!,"I tried to split the optical output from my H20 satalite receiver to power two audio sources. One output to a Bose 3-2-1 system and the second output to a surround amplifier to run powered sub and rear surround speakers. The Bose system worked good in either output socket, but my amplifier would not work in either socket. The amplifier works good with direct connection to H20 receiver. Going through this splitter weakens the signal that many audio components will not work. Waste of time & money trying. My next try will be a powered optical to coaxial converter and then split the coaxial signal."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This piece of garbage didn't work from day one. It degrades the signal so badly that no device will pick it up. I tried everything to get this thing to work, wasted a lot of time and money because I really wanted the result that this POS promised. High quality cables, check. Optical signal amplifier, check. Boatloads of frustration, double check. The signal degradation is so bad that it takes an amplified signal and degrades it to almost nothing. Now I have unused high quality cables and an unused signal amplifier just sitting around. DO NOT BUY! I will be posting this review on every single listing for this product. That's how badly it sucks."
4,Works,"I bought this to use it as a coupler and be able to connect two cables together. When I first hooked it up to my Logitech Z-5500 speakers, it wouldn't work. The signal must have been too attenuated in order to decode it properly. After I played around with the order of the cables and which I used on the splitter, it worked and has given me no problems yet.I guess this works fine, but I really haven't tested it as a splitter. Beware, though, the signal may be too weak or poor and may not work."
3,Its ok,"Does what it says, but what you should know is that most equipment is never fully powered down making this product hard to use.&#8203;"
1,Degrades Signal Too Much To Work,"This product it pretty useless. It degrades the optical signal too much. The receiver will not even pick up the signal after it is passed through the splitter. I don't even have a long cable run. I'm running a high quality 6ft cable to the ""in,"" and a 1.5ft patch cable from the out. It is definitely a splitter problem as well, because I can get the receiver to pick up audio by simply holding the 6ft and 1.5ft cables together, but nothing if I hook it up through the splitter. I know the price is enticing, but save your self the time and buy a different product."
1,its reaily totally does NOT work,"I bought it together with two optic cables. When I connected it between my i-tv and my receiver, it did NOT work. If I use the optic cable connect My I-tv to my receiver directly, it works. It means that the splitter does not work. Do Not buy it, it is a waste of money."
1,Piece o' Junk!,One side worked fine. The other side didn't work at all. But at this price it would have cost me as much to send it back. Don't buy this!
1,Didn't work for me,I tried to connect my PS3 and my Dish network reciever to my sound system via fiber optic cables using the Toslink Audio Splitter. It doesn't work. My Dish DVR transmits light signal whether on or off and I believe that is the problem. Don't bother with this splitter if you are a Dish DVR customer.
1,Simply DOES NOT WORK!,"I needed a 2-in-1-out switch to conenct 2 sources to my one receiver input. For the price, I figured I'd take the chance. but the problem is, it simply does not work. I tried all permutations, even when I only plug in one wire each side, using it as an extender, it still doesnt work, and I tried both directions! I do not know how it works for some people out there, but for me, this product is completely useless."
1,Does not work - Waste of time and money,"This splitter does not work. It will not transfer sound in any direction to any device. Transfers the red signal light ok (visually), but nothing else. Do not waste your money. You know what they say, if it is too good to be true then it usually is.I am having to find another means to connect all my components since I am shy on the optical inputs for my amp."
2,Sounded like it would work,"I bought this product so I could run two different optical sources into one port on my receiver. I understand that if you try to run two active sources into the splitter you will get nothing on the output. However, even when I only have one source running at a time I still cannot get a signal out the other side."
4,Great Jeff Gordon Collection,This is a collection of interviews and features with some actual race excerpts. I think over 4 hours in all. Nice collection but the quality of the video is whatever it was at the time - going back to the 1990's. Recommended for any Jeff Gordon fan
3,Pretty colors,"For the most part, this lot is decent. The colors are pretty. I wish the beads were bigger. Some 8mm and 10mm in the mix would be good. The 3mm seem way too small.I would give 5 Stars if I could pick my own sizes and colors!"
4,Yum-O,I found this at Whole Foods & it's great. I will never cook an Italian dish again without it. I am so glad its on Amazon as I save almost a buck each jar!
5,Do you hunger rightly for God????,"Excellent book on sacramental/liturgical/eucharistic Christian life as THE Christian life...NOT as a 'Sunday morning go-to-meeting' religious experiment BUT as as an ongoing EXPERIENCE of JOY. Acclaimed across denominational lines Schmemann's 'For the Life of the World' makes you STOP and THINK...Schmemann is like C.S. Lewis, only more distinctive [and of course, Schmemann is Orthodox]. First exposed to this book in a reading/discussion group of 'just-regular-folks' studying deeper theological works, we've come away with a hunger for more Orthodox writers. We highly recommend it, if you want to be challenged."
3,I own this and I love it! =),A soft leather bag big enough as an over-nighter bag when you go for chalets or 1-2 days trip. Can store a lot of stuffs for sure. Can double up as a great shopping bag. CheErz! =)
4,INHUMANOIDS THE EVIL THAT LIES WITHIN,"This is a cool cartoon that I use to watch wen I was a kid back in the 80s. Its about 3 GIANT Monsters. Tendril. D'Compose and Metlar the Inhumanoids. Monsters that were buried during ancient times. That just now have ben let loose by humans that did not know what they were doing. The 3 Monsters wage war against the earth after being set free. The only ones that can stop them are 4 scientists Armstrong, Bright, Auuger, and Liquidator, that form a team called Earth Corps. and some other monsters that first locked the Inhumanoids up. It is really cool that Rhino has release the Inhumanoids and some other good cartoons from the 80s.They have release The Inhumanoids the Evil that lies within Volume 1 with 2 Episodes on it. And Volume 2 with 3 Episodes on that one. what I don't get is why they did not release all 5 Episodes on 1 VHS Tape. like thy did on the DVD? and why they cut some of the theme song out? P.S the tape does not last 60 mins. its more like 30 mins."
2,OK,"Not the most powerful headphones, but the good is the volume, however it broke after two days of getting it, maybe I was not looking in the right place. I would reccoment it for those looking for high quility headphones overall, so its 50/50 for the most part."
4,Good for Cheap,"These are good earbuds, considering the price (I got them on sale for $5). The case has survived for a month in my backpack, so it's pretty durable."
1,Occasionally spark in the ear,Other than the occasionally small electric spark I feel in my ear the product is not bad. I'm not expecting a lot from them. I've got 2 pairs and I get sparks in the ear occasionally from both. My old buds (another brand) did not do this. I'll be replace these soon.
1,Terrible quality -- I want a refund!!!,"This watch looked cheap the minute I took it from the box. The strap is falling apart. Amazon, what should I do??"
3,evening with fourplay,the music is great!.... stereo does not do it justice....wish it was in dolby digital format.
4,Dynamic and smooth,"This DVD is not even 5.1 surround , but the sound is excellent. Yes you do have to crank the volume up a little bit more but the result is astounding. Use good playback equipment like revell sub and willson puppies with mark levinson amps. and enjoy the artistry and the strange jacket that Lee is wearing!"
2,What a Shame,"With today Technology with 5.1 or DTS this DVD do not have either. The Video is very poor, with the lighting making the proformers turn the color of blue. True, the music is good. But no excuse for not producing a better DVD. Take a lesson or look at the quality of George Benson or SANTANA. If you compare these titles you will indeed be very disapointment at FOURPLAY quality."
3,Query letters,Outdated book that still provides some basics. I'd go to the local library and save the money.
1,Was not what I was looking for,I hate buying books online - the book was not poorly written but was simply not what I was looking for. If you are looking for examples of great query letters for children's books this is not the book for you.
3,I also received my first response from an editor!,"Everyone is different so I assume some writers did not see the value of this book. I used the advice and received a request to see my cookbook manuscript. The only thing I thought would have been nice - is that the author would have appeared to want to help new writers more by answering questions or by putting up a website with links to relevant topics, etc. Any help is however a good thing when you are starting up! Maybe a reprint is in order to update the information - but who are we to say! I would also like to recommend you visit my member page to see my review on Michael Larsens book called How to Write a Book Proposal.~The Rebecca Review"
5,A reliable workhorse from the dame of the old school,"So it's old. So it's a little smarmy. So there are sample pitch letters about how ""by 1990, it's believed that many Americans will have computers."" So a lot of people have moved on to selling stories with sloppy little e-mail notes. So what.Lisa Collier Cool teaches you to cross all the 'T's to give your pitch letter unstoppable propulsion. You might read her method and say, 'that's overkill.' But unless you've got a better idea (such as phoning up your old Ivy League buddies for an assignment) this is what you want for breaking in to a magazine on the strength of raw ideas, not schmoozy contacts.If it wasn't for this book I'd probably be in law school right now."
5,You Have to Buy This Book!,"This was the book that opened my eyes up to the possibilities in freelance writing, and it's one that I will continue to use due to its overflowing resources of example queries, ideas, etc. Anyone who wants to publish an article or a book MUST READ THIS!!"
5,It helped me so much!,"The book was extremely helpful in showing me how to hit higher notes than I will ever need to sing, so the range I do sing in feels like a piece of cake. I can now sing anything by U2, Bon Jovi, and just about anybody you care to mention with total professional quality, with ease. The book provided me with a completely logical understanding of how my voice works, so practicing and mastering the exercises came quite naturally. No matter what style you sing this book will help you do it better!"
5,Review,This is an excellent DVD with a good life lesson. My grandson really enjoys it. I would recommend this DVD
5,Happy,So pleased with the quality of this product. It holds up well to my 3 boys. Its heavy card stock. My boys love it. It def. makes learning more fun. Even my 3 yr old loves to make the easier patterns. We also purchased the additional patterns and love them just as much. Great buy!
4,Great learning tool!,Bought as a Christmas gift & our son loves it. Good quality & will be able to use with our other children as they get older.
2,"1 shape is missing, otherwise I would give 5 stars",For some reason I don't have the option to send feedback on this order so I am writing here in hopes that someone will contact me. The product arrived early and in good shipping condition. Everything is good quality but we didn't get any of the orange squares that should have been in the package. The box says it should come with six different shapes and colors but ours only came with 5. Someone please contact me and correct this. I think if we had all the parts we would love this product and order more cards.
1,Missing Shape,"This would have been perfect purchase, but the orange square shape is missing from the package. Not a happy customer."
3,"125-ZOLA, Color: Black Leather, Men's US Size 12","great price, good looking boot, but NOT meant for heavy use. the soles are not solid rubber and are glued instead of sewn, so they tear away from the boot easily. probably fine if all you are doing is walking around at faires, but definitely no good for long wear or stage combat."
4,Good looking and a good value,"The Zola boot runs a bit big in the foot, as I normally wear a 10 and these 9's are quite comfortable in both length and width. They are a bit narrow in the shaft though, especially if wearing them over a skinny leg jean. The quality is decent for the price but would be unacceptable if the price were any higher. I bought mine here at Amazon for $57. They do look good though and with a coat of leather conditioner they'll stretch a bit and also shine up the dullness of the matte finish leather. The grippy rubber sole is appreciated for outdoor winter wearing. All in all a good buy, quite comfortable for walking/wearing and I've received numerous positive comments on them."
1,CRAP,"These boots lasted about 4 hours of light wear. The soles are poor, the ""pig leather"" started to rip and tear after light use. Spend a little extra and get a decent set of boots. Do not waste your money"
4,wolf review,"this toy is a great idea. It is soft and cuddley as well as cute.You can play good games with it, take it everywhere with you.If I have not convinced you to buy this item, look at its sad eyes and you will instantly fall in love."
1,Nothing New Here,"I got this book from a friend and I'm so glad that I didn't spend the money on it myself (and sorry that my friend did). The writing was juvenile and vague. Sorry, but I expect a bit more from my books, even about something as dry as taxes.The attempts to keep it interesting came through the personal stories, which were too anecdotal (it seemed like the author just talked to her relatives to get some good things to say) to have any relevance to me. What were they supposed to be telling me other than that the author can't write and is using these personal stories to pretend she can?As for the actual tax tips. . .I took this to my accountant and he began pointing out the errors page by page and there were a lot of them.Who likes feeling like they're going to get audited for following a book that's supposedly written by an expert?"
1,This woman is a con-artist,"This book is filled with nothing new...someone just out to get money...my husband is an accountant specialing in tax returns, he thought some of the information would actually red flag the IRS to do an audit!!!!! Spend your money elsewhere!!"
4,Good Information,"I have to say I disagree with Candace, I was not dissappointed at all after reading the book. Also, the first few pages of the IRS tax pamphlet doesn't really tell you much of anything. It certainly doesn't outline or highlight tax breaks for taxpayers, so that information is wrong.Yeah, there are personal stories but they help to give taxpayers a better understanding of how we can save on our taxes. So the personal stories do justice to the book.The book is only $14.95 and was definately not a waste of money for people who don't have a clue about tax breaks and that's people like me. So, I'd buy the book again and have already recommended it to my friends and family."
1,Legal??? Seems shady to me,"I found this book to be a complete waste of my time. Some of the ""savings"" Ms. Carter suggested seemed like an immediate audit to me.I thought this year I'd try to do my taxes myself, so I purchased this book. After the boring, useless read I ended up just taking my taxes to my trusty accountant.I couldn't even resell this book."
4,Tax Breaks They Don't Want You To Know About...,"I just borrowed this book from my girlfriend and she loved it and I liked it, because there are no hard math problems to figure out. Explanations are written in layman's terms, so even I can understand them. I'm gonna go get my taxes done at H & R Block this week, but at least I have compiled a list of 10 questions to ask about tax credits I might be eligible for this year.I need to buy a new car, so I'm hoping I can get the tax credits/breaks I recently discovered in this new book. Funny but interesting stories about taxes. Enjoyed it and highly recommended."
5,DA CROOKED - DA REALEST,"TO THE HOMEBOY WHO SAID Z-RO IS THE KING OF DA SOUTH UNDA 'FACE' IS CORRECT. FLIP & T.I. DON'T DISRESPECT DA GANGSTA. LET THE TRUTH BE TOLD IS ONE OF THE COLDEST ALBUMS OF '05 REPRESENTIN' NOT ONLY THE SOUTHSIDE, BUT EVERY HOOD ACROSS EVERY STATE. SONGS 1-17 GO OFF!

3,a texas champ!!!!!,its bout time a rapper from texas rap more about street thing then there damn grill.........i have never give this fool a chance but being from memphis and more into the cruck stuff this cd aint that bad it could be better but yo kno he is from texas.....the lyrics not bad he sound like a new age scraface..beat r weak not it u like that slow age rap u kno what i mean texas.........and this fool need to go on with his singin mane!!!! but on the real i give it a 3 its not that bad....
5,C-No Brown Review,"Ro is a well known certified microphone assasin. It was only right for this album to follow the national Z-Ro tradition of wreckage! This album isn't as deep and heart wrenching as Life of Joseph McVeigh, but it has what it needs because it adds the more commercial, easy to shop Z-ro to the menu. Now nigg@s can stop hatin and give the man his well deserved respect."
5,The Realest Rapper In The Game. Period.,"Joseph McViegh. Nuff Said. Z-ro has come to a level in his lyrics where no one else in the south can really touch him. Try to picture Pac and sprinkle a little bit of Nas and add some H-town slang to tha words, and you have Z-ro. This album is probably my 2nd favorite from Z-ro, runnin neck & neck wit Life Of Joseph McViegh (King Of Da Ghetto is his best album). From track 1 to 17 this album is off da chain. The only track that I rewind through is Diamonds In My Mouth cuz Lil Flip is on it. Lil Flip is a discrace to H-town, and I wouldnt be sayin dat if I didnt know that nigga, but I do(read my review to ""U Gotta Feel Me""). But anywayz, this album is thowed cuz Z-ro alwayz keeps it realer than tha rest. GET IT."
1,"Beware, formula has changed","This used to be a great soap with a clean, fresh scent. Unfortunately, it's been reformulated, and they've added a ton of perfume. It's so bad, it stinks up the whole house; I had to put it in a plastic bag and take it outside to the garbage. Complete waste of money. I'm always amazed at how a company can take a good product and ruin it like this."
5,Festival! Festival!,"'Return of the Archons' is probably my all-time favorite episode of 'Star Trek.' It has so much going for it, I don't know where to begin. Of course, it's basically a parable about the alleged evils of 'mind control' but it's quite possibly the funniest, most entertaining show ST ever had! From the robotic, mindless natives of Landru's planet, to Sulu (with dreamy gaze) waxing about 'Paradise, my friend' and 'sweetest people in the universe' to McCoy coming under the spell of Landru (""You speak strangely, friend, are you from away?"" and ""You speak in strange whispers."") This is the one ST episode I can watch endlessly and not get tired of."
5,Wonderful,"This is the 31st book I have read by Catherine Cookson. I really loved this book as I did almost 95% of her other books. I had no idea how the story would end and was a little fearful because of the word ""virgin"" in the title. I won't say how it ended because that would be a spoiler. I liked the book all the way through and am always amazed at what an excellent story teller this author was."
3,it's all just product endoresment,"this book provides helpful tips, as long as you don't look at it as a giant advert for aveda. it's also not the most well-edited book, and the layout is not very well thought out. the pictures are very pretty and the ones of the yoga positions are quite helpful. the descrpitions of the oils is also helpful. and the products are quite nice anyways."
1,hated it,this is a waste of money. It is alot of interviews from a bunch of nobodys that know of britney. No performances and not really any britney.This sucks!
4,Goes Out On A Limb and Hangs On,"This album contains a very eclectic mix of musical and production styles. While it is often compared to Dark Side of the Moon, the melodies which are reminiscent of Pink Floyd sound a lot more like early Floyd than any of Floyd's hit albums.But this album is much more diverse in style than that. ""Get Duffy"" is an instrumental that reminds me of Kruder & Dorfmeister or Air in its analog techno sound. ""Motorhead"" has enough grit and samples to pass for a Ministry song.This album will hook you on Primal Scream. It is easier to listen to than XTRMNTR, and is a better place to start for a first time listener. I also think this album has a more mature sound than their earlier albums: less ear candy and more song crafting."
4,if there isn't medication i will put 5 stars,"An excellent album. as i'm a big fan of Verve,i always love to explore more about the acid-daydream-dance-psyco british scence. and i found that Verve really got somekind of influence from Primal Scream. and i love them.VP is a very cool ablum. specially the groove lines are one of the kind,but guitars really are poor(compared to Verve). you guys who like this album really should take 10 minutes to try on the taste of Verve, whitch is even more innovantive than PS.if there isn't that silly song called 'medication',whitch is almost identical with all those songs they made with a 'stone' touch(if not copy), i really think this album is of a 5star category."
2,Not so great,"This CD was a bit of a disappointment for me. Dischordant bits often drag on and on. For those looking for a Screamadelica-style experience, this is not it. ""Medication"" (depite other reviews) is a good tune. But 1 out of however-many, is not a good ratio. I might not buy more Primal Scream CDs after this, which bums me out."
1,Audible Download,"Don't get the audible download. The quality is the worst I've experienced. This should be removed from Audible. I'm a fan of Louise Hay and enjoy listening to her, however, when I bought the audible version for my ipod, I was so disappointed. It's garbled, the music drowns out the narration. I suggest buy the book."
5,One of those books you use all your life,This is an important book. The affirmations help to lift you up if you are having a bad time. I've been using this book for years. Whenever I use the affirmations I always have a more positive attitude and a happier day than if I hadn't used them. This is my favorite Louise Hay book.
5,LIFE! Reflections on your journey,"I have found instruction to challenge the tough self talk that has held me back. How to love me, which is what I've really been looking for on my journey and how to stay in the present moment, yet recognize what words I use all day on myself that I have allowed to run rampant; and how to flood those thoughts out. I learned it is the entire universe of which I am a part of and not to have tunnel vision in this process. Ms. J"
2,not impressive,"This book just piles up a lot addtion/subtract/multiplication problems like worksheets. Nothing special. There are many other cheaper workbooks doing just as well. In fact, we ended up using a nice Houston community web site Beestar (http://www.beestar.org), which is definitely better and is free."
3,Beautiful But Incomplete,"A beautiful book but far from complete. I was shocked to see that Ingrid glass was completely ignored, only because it isn't signed by the manufacturer and some pieces are currently still made. Many other Bohemian manufacturers are also overlooked. You'll surely see some pieces you never knew existed though. Unfortunately not the difinitive resource you'd hope for. Maybe a book 3 is in order."
5,Killer book on the SEC if you love to travel,Traveling to road games in the SEC just got a lot easier thanks to this book by Chris Warner. I think this is one of the best ideas for a sports book in a long time. There are a lot of facts here. I highly recommend it!
4,An SEC Football Fan's Must!!!,"A fellow LSU/SEC football fanatic (and best friend) gave me this book as a present. It was a great gift. If you enjoy SEC Football (and who doesn't?), this book is a must read. The author gives you all the scoop you need to properly enjoy your SEC roadtrippin'. A great synopsis of each program, university, added with some local flavor from each SEC school.If you are like me, and plan a roadtrip following your favorite SEC team each year, you need to read this book. Because nothing is funner than taking over your opponent's favorite hangout and turning it into your own......GEAUX TIGERS!!!!"
4,Good reference Book,"Well written and informative, Warner's book is a great reference source for any SEC football fan. Each chapter covers the important players and coaches from each school. However, if you are looking for anything deeper, go elsewhere. None of the big issues, i.e. segregation/integration or cheating/NCAA violations are covered. The book does a great job of accomplishing Warner's goals. I only wish he'd have been a bit more ambitious and tackled questions tougher than, ""who was the best QB in Florida history?"""
4,A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football,"A great reference manual for all SEC fans.The stay home fan will enjoy learning histories & traditions of all SEC schools.The ""tailgator"" will futher benifit from directions to stadiums & hints to ""eats"" & nightlife nearby."
4,i enjoyed it,I love teh look of it and the functions like teh s buttons made it easy and entertaining to use. it has all that i need but I would have like it more if i could upgrade it more.
1,Risky investment,"I did not buy this computer but I bought two VAIO PCG-NV before. Both computers became very sick (memory slot problem, dvd-rom problem, lcd problem, etc) just after the warranty expired. There is a sony service center in my city but I was not allowed to drop my laptops there. I had to pay the shipping fee plus more than $250 for each computer to be repaired. A few months ago, one latop suffered from the ""motherboard"" disease. I decided that it is not worthwhile to save its life. The Worst purchase I even made."
1,Vaio Laptop Computers :-(,"I didn't buy this laptop, but did buy a Vaio Laptop 2 years ago and have to say that their quality just isn't worth what you're paying for. I spent $3000 on my laptop and now have to spend another $500 to get it fixed after only 2 years. The only authorized sony service center is over 100 miles away from me and I live in Los Angeles! And if it's that far from where you live you have spend money to ship it to them to get it fixed and their service prices are so expensive, you're better off buying a new laptop from someone else. So be very wary of buying a Sony Laptop. I've found it's really not worth it. I believe it's just the name you're paying for, nothing else. I think it's better to buy a $1000 laptop and then dump it if it has any real problems, which will probably save you money than to spend top dollar on a Sony and have to spend top dollar on repairs.I'm a disgusted Ex-Customer of Sony."
1,hola,saben me falta mis discos de instalacion de mi computadora nesesito el sistema operativoPorque esta infectada de virus y nesesito formatearlaporfavor espero su respuestaAtte:Enrique
4,Awesome Laptop!,"Fantastic screen, weighs just over 6 pounds, good keyboard and fast! The usual crappy touch pad (sorry, but I prefer a mouse) but any wireless mouse makes this the perfect desktop replacement machine. The only complaint I have is that all of the connections (USB, ethernet, etc) are on the sides of the machine. I would have preferred them in the back of the machine. All in all though - an excellent laptop for people who need high performance!"
2,i'm a loser college kid now.,"i bought this laptop from a retailer outside of amazon for $2000+, thinking i was getting a top-of-the-line system, perfect for college! i was wrong. i've had to bring it to my tech services on campus 4 times to help me with these problems:- wifi connection problems- windows registry problems (with the HOME edition it came with. i actually had to buy xp pro and perform a clean install, losing all my saved data)- my battery life, 2 years later, lasts about 20 minutesbottom line, don't buy it. it's almost like a 50/50 with sony products; it's either great or terrible.my laptop sucks so mnuch, my friends make fun of me!"
2,One's Hero is Another's Terrorist,"Yuck. I guess Miss Campobello and her Mother were supporters of Pancho Villa and his Comrades.I expected a ""child's"" view of how sad war is. What I got was a distorted view of her sadistic heroes. She tells of young boys playing only to be stopped by a Villista and then taken to a cemetery to be shot just because of who their fathers were. Or of a high ranking Villista who liked whipping young men with his sword, stopping when the sword was nearly broken. These ""freedom fighters"" were gangsters or terrorists.It made me really, really sad of what may be going on right now in certain parts of the world.Mr. Villa, you were no Emiliano Zapata.Honestly, the book made me sick. I hope Miss Campobello did better in her documenting her country's folk dances than in writing a book about her country through the eyes of a child.Check out the book at your local library."
5,"Brilliant, touching and very very funny","Julia Sweeney has a gift for making you laugh at one line and weep at the next. Normally I can't stand that type of emotional manipulation, which is usually what the artist is trying to do, but with Ms. Sweeney it comes so naturally and is so unforced. ""God said HA"" is brilliant and Julia deserves a spot in the monologist/storytelling hall of fame!"
3,Coverage is Good and Material is Accurate - No Data Sets,Most Statistical Analysis needs computational data. There is very little data other than statistical parameters included in the included tests in every test case and througout the text. This text is accurate and current but outdated in reference to the need for use of computation and computational data.
3,"Not bad, but it could be better.","I've read some books of ""Schaum's Outline"" series and I think that this one is not so good. In my opinion, the principal area of the subject is ""hypothesis testing"" that is not well covered. Despite this, the ""probability distributions"" part is usefull."
5,Really Lives Up To Its Name!,"This is a truly remarkable book! I wish I had it when I first learned to quilt years ago. Loaded with great tips and beautiful photographs, this book will not just collect dust on your shelves with all your other quilting ""tips"" books; it truly is a rare find. I have put several of the tips and tricks presented into use already and it has made my quilting quicker, and more fun. Great gift for beginners (send it along with some fabric!)"
4,Best all-Time for Quilters,"This book is very,usefull.You don't have to follow the pages ,you can also open at the subject you need.I'm using it for all the things I'm not sure about.I'm very happy that I found it .Thanks Rosane Mortensen - Holbaek Denmark"
3,Super Reader,"Bolan, after getting his Death Squad killed knows he needs an edge. He looks up an old acquaintance from Vietnam, a doctor, who is now a plastic surgeon, and procures a 'Battle Mask'.The cops are still looking for him, as is the mafia, so a large amount of violence comes to the small town his doctor mate lives in. Luckily some of the locals see it Bolan's way, and help him out, to their own cost.With a new look, Bolan goes to finish the job on DiGiorgio's mob, using his estranged daughter as leverage and a way into the house.After sending some info their way, the police are currently looking more way, and Bolan sets out to destabilise this mafia branch with some disinformation techniques, some name-dropping, and some guns.Again, there is a high cost for those around him, as well as those who oppose him."
2,The best part is the salt,"Anyone who's spent any time around the salt ponds in the SF Bay Area know that they are lovely and under-appreciated. But that's no reason to buy this film. I did, and I feel pretty silly about it.The movie has a predictable, un-enlightening and mild-mannered script, that really makes the whole thing look like a class exercise, rather than a movie. There's some talented actors -- but they have nothing to do.The thing that really surprised me was how bad the cinematography was. The salt marshes were pretty enough --although, having spent much time there, I was surprised at how much of the real beauty of the place was missed. But the filming of people was terrible -- nothing was either stimulating or natural.It looks like an honest effort: this is not a hollywood film. So I hope the people involved work harder and think more deeply about their next project."
1,Is the quoted price for the whole serry of 7 books?,"If the quoted price is for the whole serry of 7 books, it is reasonable. But if it is only for the 2nd book of serry, it is excessively expensive, as the books are sold for &#8356;20($36)each."
1,crummy,I was very disappointed in the product because it is not what it is advertised to be a soundtrack. To me a soundtrack contains the people who sing the songs in the movie not someone else singing the songs.
3,Disappointing,"With Levon Helm in the movie, and (albeit briefly) singing in the movie, its a shame that he is not on this soundtrack. A missed opportunity, for sure."
1,Extremely Disappointing !,"The reviews on this album indicated that the artist's were not the ones featured in the movie. This CD was bought for only one song, a waltz that was vocalized in the movie; but the CD was only instrumental. I threw the CD away !"
4,Dont Do It,"Again and again, we fans throw caution to the wind and buy yet another Japanese packaged Bob show. And, again and again, we put it in only to hear exactly what we feared: what once must have been a great show ruined by whomever dubbed it.Same thing here, and you should stay away unless you are truly a die-hard fan (with more money than most die hard fans). The saving grace is a rare live version of So Long Rastafari Call You. Bob fans know this was rarely played live, thus making any concert at which it was extremely valuable and worth a pick-up. And it just so happens that this part of show is OK quality and this version is simply beautiful, making the purchase tolerable. If not for that, I could recommend to no one with a straight face that they should buy this CD, and unless you count yourself among the seriously obsessed fans, you shouldn't either. (...)"
1,Keep Looking,"I would start this book on the sixth Friday of the month. Here is another ""business thriller"" that is lost in the real business world and far from a thriller. The problem I had with the book is that the author determined a story and he fit all the facts to it - sure this is the way one writes a book, but in this case what was taking place would never happen in a real business. With this being the case it is very hard to believe the book."
3,"Beautiful, but functionality is problematic at best.","After having this keyboard for two days I'm returning it becauseI'm already frustrated with pressing the connect button onEVERY device every time I boot up. It is a beautiful, slickkeyboard and the mouse is great. But it's of no use to me ifI have to go through this connection hassle EVERY TIME I BOOT UP. Logitech should not have put this thing on the market without testing it futher, and if this is indicative of bluetooth technology... best of luck to them.Forget it, back to my wired keyboard and optical mouse."
2,"If you don't like notebook keyboard, this one either.","A beautiful product, but not so comfortable. The feeling of keystroke is very similar to gerenal notebook keyboard.The mediapad is not a good idea for non-western language, you will get ???? for all non-western character. And I get my mediapad RMAed twice (a tedious procedure that I won't mention here). The idea of media center is not as useful, because the software is tightly integrated with MS Media Player, so I can not get any benefit from my iTunes.If you don't use keyboard often, and need some beautiful gadget on your desktop, I would recommend this. Otherwise, find other robust keyboard."
1,USB Bluetooth Receiver WORTHLESS,"The included receiver has very limited range. If you already have another receiver (I did) you might be able to live with this set.There is no back lighting on the keys or mediapad LCD.The media pad is somewhat useful to use as remote control for iTunes and Windows Media Player. However the useless LCD can't navigate song titles, it simply displays the currently playing title. Would be great if you could scroll down a list of artist/tunes and tag for play."
2,"Cool Design, but Poor Function","I had read several reviews here before purchasing this product, but went ahead and bought it anyway, thinking that Logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted. I was wrong.After a few weeks of satisfactory use (long enough to get past Amazon's reasonable window for returns), the space bar started working intermittently. Incredibly annoying, and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes.Even before the space bar turned against me I was unimpressed with the feel of the keys (I use a Dell wireless keyboard, an Apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my IBM X-series laptop).Bottom line - the thing looks great on a desk, and it is nicely compact, but it probably won't do what you need it to. Look elsewhere."
3,"OK, but not good enough","I am returning this package after about a week of use. My first disappointment with it was discovering that in order to set it up, I had to come up with 6 AA batteries. The mouse is shipped with batteries, but the keyboard (4) and the media pad (2) are not. This keyboard is uncomfortable. With my hands on the home keys, my palms extend over the front edge of the keyboard. Also, I often have to reconnect the keyboard and/or mouse when I log on to my computer first thing in the AM. This is just a short procedure of pushing a couple of buttons and typing in a security number, but it's still annoying. I like the separate numeric keypad, and its media functions are handy, but all in all it just isn't working out for me."
2,"Nice style, poor function","I love the way this product looked. It was slim and sexy. The reality was that it was a battery hog, the media pad was basically useless, there were frequent bluetooth disconnections, and I actually had to return it once because the keys stopped working (I am not a gorilla typist). I eventually gave up on it. I give it 2 stars b/c it was a nice design, but it just didn't deliver."
3,"Overall a good product, but numeric keypad...","Overall this is a good product, but numeric keypad is a little disappointing. I am a CPA and I rely heavily on the numeric keypad to quickly enter numbers. The ability to use the keypad seperate from the keyboard was my deciding factor to purchase this unit over any other bluetooth combination. The keys are too small, and are not responsive. Many times I have to enter numbers two or three times. The rest of the unit is terriffic. The mouse is outstanding as well as the keyboard. The bluetooth range is far more than you will ever need."
1,has plenty of issues...,"Well, I have not had this keyboard combo for very long but now I see where all the users are frustrated. As others have mentioned it looses connection on all three devices here and there, not one set time or cause its just that one or more devices will just stop working and disappear from he bluetooth menu!?!? You have to keep a separate USB mouse and keyboard on very close on hand to use this wireless combination, how does that figure in? Expensive for all the problems it has but sure looks cool, I guess I can just leave it sitting on the desk for looks only!?! If they could only get the thing to work!"
4,Almost perfect - use new drivers though,"I bought this for the size and the bluetooth. It is thin and fits nicely into my keyboard drawer. My notebook has bluetooth and they paired up nicely. As a keyboard it feels like a high end board and works perfectly. The mouse is nice as well, but not great for switching hands. The only feature annoyance is that they didn't bother putting a scroll wheel on the keyboard as in the Elite Duo. If they added that feature and a dozen or more programmable buttons, this board would be perfect. Oh ya, DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE/DRIVERS BEFORE YOU EVEN BEGIN. --- Amendment: So now that I've had this for several months I would give it 2 stars. The SetPoint software fails on all the computers running MS Office Outlook. Logitech help is useless...several hours wasted. The Bluetooth is still great and the feel of the board very nice, but w/o SetPoint you can't use most of the features. Shame on Logitech!"
2,Bloated buggy software,"64MB of software, constant checks for updates, items in my system tray - just for a keyboard and mouse? Ridiculous.I kept this keyboard/mouse going for about a year on a home theater PC, but am retiring it now. It was nothing but trouble - constantly losing contact after sleep or reboots, requiring lots of fiddling with Windows and Logitech configuration interfaces. An additional wired mouse, at least, is required to maintain your system.I don't know if it's a Microsoft or Logitech problem, but I'll avoid buying new Bluetooth gizmos from now on. I replaced this with a non-Bluetooth RF keyboard/trackball combo that I love.Also, the separate keypad eats batteries much too quicklyNow, I'm just trying to salvage the Bluetooth USB dongle for use with another Bluetooth device I foolishly bought, but I don't want the huge Logitech install just for that. Wish me luck."
1,The Worst keyboard on earth,"Very simple, if you want your life to be in peace, please don't even think to buy this. I literally had to throw this in to the trashcan. It worked, nice for a few months, (2), then the nightmare started. Losing connection every 15 minutes, then the left ctrl key, stopped to work, then the left alt key. I reinstalled every thing several times, without any success.Finally, to get this nightmare worst, 2 key pads came out.I wrote several times to Logitech. No answer.I decided to throw it away. Very very disappointed, and it wasn't a $ 25 keyboard"
5,"so far, its been terrific","The aesthetics are the 1st thing I notice with new products. The DiNovo is no exception. The build quality is outstanding, the feel of the keys themselves quite solid. and I have had no trouble to date. The connection to the bluetooth hub takes a second or so to connect when the computer boots up-- but so what. Its not a significant issue that should discourage someone from considering this product. The mouse is also terrific- excellent ergonomics/ comfort, plus it has thoughtful and well located button features. If any technical failures happen Ill update this post- but so far its worked flawlessly. certainly makes typing enjoyable- and there is zero timelag with the bluetooth once connected. Its immediately responsive to keyboard input. and no messy wires running across my desk!"
2,Beauty and the Beast,"I was first stricken with the beauty of the design of this set, Logitech hit the bullseye with the look. Once I got the set home and got it installed, all without a hitch I might add, I found myself most pleased with the feel of the keyboard, it is a very comfortable keyboard and it is very quiet.But after about 2 months the beast began to emerge to my dismay and shock! I have been a loyal logitech user for sometime, never encountering any serious problems with any of their products, but after 2 months the left ctrl key just stopped working, nothing I could do to fix it. I also encountered frequent connection troubles with the bluetooth mostly with the mouse, I would often have to wait a few minutes after boot for the mouse to be connected.The sudden malfunctioning keys issue seems to be common among many users of this particular Logitech product, as well as the connection issues, in light of this I strongly urge buyers to look elsewhere for a keyboard and mouse set."
1,"Expensive, breaks, limited support","Other logitech products I own perform well. This one does not.Maybe i am living in la la land, but when i pay a premium price for a product I expect it to work well for a long period of time. If it stops working, I expect support from the manufacturer to make it right. support of computer equipment should be online and by phone.PROS:feels great, looks great.CONS:after several months of normal use, things began to fall apart, the keyboard began to:lose connection with the computer through BT, requiring a on/off of the BT and reconnectno support to speak of - no driver updates, no forum support, even though there are hundreds of complaints. in fact the moderators simply ignore the requests for assistance - google it.buttons pop off (and are a nightmare to put back)charger stopped working (now it just flashes red/green when in the dock and does not charge).now the only use i see for it is as a frisbee to toss around logitech's headquarters."
1,Dont bother: inferior flawed product,Great design and features. Problem is that the bluetooth hub & software are inoperable and not fit for sale. Will work when you don't install the bluetooth stack but only the newer setpoint software. The only advantage at that point is that it has more range than other RF wireless sets. You can read details about the flaws in most other reviews here. Updated software doesn't solve the problems. I was happy when the cats puked on it (again) after which it stopped for good. They must have known it was no good.I will never again buy a bluetooth mouse/keyboard and feel cheated as I paid the early high price for it and lost many $$$.
4,Really cool car,"Bought this for my nephew. Everyone loved the car at the party. Pretty easy to put together. Good quality for the price. I don't think this is an heirloom item, but for the price, it is great."
2,All form and no function,This car looks great but is poorly designed-- it doesn't ride well (my son always rolls over his feet) and the steering wheel has broken. May look cool from a parents' point of view but not really made for kids.
1,sent me the wrong color race car! I ordered a red race car.,I ordered this in October for Christmas for our grandson. I opened the box to see if it needed to be assembled and I was shocked to see it was GREY! I ordered RED! The photo on the page I was ordering from showed a RED RACE CAR! I am livid! How could you do this to my grandson? I wanted a different color because my twin cousins have the gray ones. I can't tell you excited I was when I saw the red race car. It was perfect for us. Now on the order summary it shows a grey race car. How did you do that to a customer? I want my money back or send me the RED RACE CAR like I ordered. This is not how you treat people. Our Christmas is ruined because of this.
3,This is an okay toy.,"It's not so friendly to steer and drive. Too long and has an inconvenient turning radius. The ""Big Wheel"" of the '70s would be much more fun for any child."
4,Five stars for Haskil,"I hadn't heard anything by Clara Haskil before buying this disc, except for her DG Originals Mozart concerti which didn't make much of an impression one way or the other. This disc, however, is another story. Haskil's is a very impressive k. 466, tragic and intense without verging in any way into Romantic anachronism. Both the Mozart and the Scarlatti are distinguished by lively intelligence and subtle use of pianistic colour.The caveat has to do with the orchestral contribution to the Mozart, which doesn't come through in particularly good sound and is sometimes overly Romantic for my taste, particularly in the slow movement."
5,Amazing and fine,"I am very happy to see this recording and hope that it continues to be available.It is a little known masterwork and a marvelous recording.There is much to enjoy on many levels, first the story itself speaks to our times.Then there is the skill and value of the composition itself. I am particularly struck by the coloristic effects and wide range of mood and action. I can hear that Villa Lobos was aware of all types of music, and also could use all the variety in a unified work.The orchestra is very fine and Fleming is superb in voice and musicianship.Conductor Alfred Heller brings much love and skill and knowledge to this work."
5,Just another review.,"When I first learned about the case, I was sure of it to be murder. I read this book, and my feelings were confirmed even stronger. This book examines things very well and digs deep under the surface. It makes the murder case even stronger. I decided to read it again, a little less thank a year after the first time. Although upon completion, I felt differently. I don't know what caused it, but my veiws on the subject completely changed. I no longer blamed Courtney. I no longer went on believing something that had yet to be proven. I'm much happier now that I'm no longer ignorant enough to blame someone for something that hasn't been deemed true. I feel I owe that to this book for whatever reason it might be."
3,what happened?,"this book doesn't answer any questions that the title says it does, it just takes you through the events leading up too the death of kurt cobain and sepulation but i must add i do believe that maybe someone was there when kurt donald cobain ended an genre that killed of hair metal i don't believe he could of shot up with that my heroin and then put the syringe away then go and pull the trigger...whatever you believe and entertaining bookbetter than the sugar coated biography ""heavier than heaven"" by charles R.cross"
5,Best Cobain Book ever - Book Courtney,I could not put this one down. It made me realize how much evidence points to the reality that Kurt was murdered. Bravo Simon and Schuster for publishing it. I read Halperin's last book on models. It was a gem. This is a great follow-up. Every Cobain fan out there should buy it for their collection. It rocks!
5,Best book yet!!,"As I am reading this book I keep asking myself why Courtney has not been taken into custody & questioned reguarding Kurt's death. The evidence presented from Tom Grant's tapes of Courtney constantly changing her story, among other things, and of Kurt & Courtney's lawyer saying she believed he was murdered leaves me wondering why no one has looked further into the murder theory. After reading Who Killed Kurt Cobain, I believe that Courtney off'd Kurt without a doubt. After reading this book it's incredible that anyone would think Kurt killed himself. Courtney even states on tape that Kurt is worth more dead than alive. Come on people, get your ""stuff"" together and more actively persue re-opening the case. I am amazed that anyone would believe Courtney didn't have someone kill Kurt after they have read this book. There is way too much evidence and too many unanswered questions to think otherwise. I guess what they say is true, it is possible to get away with murder...."
4,Suicide or Murder? I think Murder!,"I still have many questions after trying to sort throug everyone's conversations. I tend to think it was murder though. Why would Courtney Love not try and get the information/photo's that was being asked for by the PI? She was the one that had hired him and because she has something to hide! This case will never be investigated again by the SPD. They say once a junkie, always a junkie. The one thing that I can say after reading this book, Courtney Love is a white piece of trash and may her soul burn in hell!"
5,I HATE COURTNEY LOVE,"THE BOOK IS A GREAT READ! IF YOU'RE A FAN OF KURT COBAIN OR HIS BAND NIRVANA,I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU READ THIS BOOK!! R.I.P. KURT"
5,VERY GOOD BOOK,This is a VERY good book! I am a HUGE Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fan. This book is very well written and I couldn't put it down! This book is for anyone trying to figure out if his death was suicide or murder. It's for any Kurt Cobain fan!
5,Greatest Book of ALL TIME!,"This is my third copy of this particular book because my friends keep borrowing it and then their friends ask if they can also borrow it, etc... I love it."
4,Cheers for Captain Lacey,"This was my first Captain Lacey book, but it certainly won't be my last. I was disappointed when I couldn't get a hold of any more of Rosemary Stevens's charming Beau Brummell mysteries as I enjoy novels set in the Edwardian/Regency/Victorian eras, but Ms. Gardner have provided me with a complex and appealing new hero. I especially enjoy her descriptions of ""how the other half live"" in the two novels I have read thus far and find her female characters most interesting. I look forward to getting a hold of Lacey's earlier adventures as well as discovering what his future might be with Lady Breckenridge!"
4,Keeping the top level in her writing!,"I really love these series. When you read so many books of the same series, sometimes it gets boring and predictable. It is a hazard to the writers that follow that road,they fall frequently in this , but she still keep it interesting, probably, because the main character, Cpt.Lacey is adorable, he is everything you look forward in a down to earth hero but still full of flaws that make him so real and authentic."
3,Not as good as the others,"As far a style goes, this book was well written, but the plot development was rather weak and shallow compared to the other books in the Captain Lacey Regency Mysteries. I haven't been reading the series in order, so I know the author does better with both earlier and later works."
2,Hard to get into the book,I have found that Ashley's writing style is hard for me to get caught up in. The books has be bored by the end of the 2nd Chapter.
3,I find that I do not LIKE Captain Lacey or any ...,"I've read, maybe, three books in this series and don't really like any of the regular characters in the series.The mysteries are fine (except for the annoying characters) and the author writes well (except for the lack of engaging characters). It's possible that I'm getting really tired of serial characters where the story never ends and the characters go on and on like some perverse relocation of the worst creations of television and radio: the Soap Opera."
4,light and sturdy,"Tripod itself is quite sturdy, with very good extension and stability.Only little gripe is the knobs to loosen the legs need a few turns to extend the legs, a 1/4 turn to loosen would be great. Don't know if that even exists...Collapses pretty small too for a tripod with this height extension.Used this with an Induro ball head supports about 10 lbs with the head.(1/4"" to 3/8"" screw adapter needed for this.Not an issue if you use Slik heads.I used Induro because of a medium format camera I have.)."
3,Travel to New Orleans with America's favorite sleuth,"Most of the book has twists and turns that the reader will find surprising. But some of the chapters are far-fetched. At least, the last couple of chapters. The plot becomes irrelevent, as do the characters. Although I enjoyed the book, the writing gets sloppy. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to ""Provence--To Die For,"" which hits bookstores in April 2002. I am a Murder, She Wrote ""fan,"" but the better mysteries are in the past. Maybe the next murder mystery will have more substance than the last five books."
4,Excellent. Challenging.,Not for beginners. Blake requires technique and Mann moves fast through the pieces. But if you're an intermediate+ player this will get you into some great tuneage.
5,Great book to read every day,"This Book is great to read for anyone with an inspired mind, I love the fact that you can read one page, full of facts each day of the year. Highly recomended."
1,Ben Franklin's Almanac of Wit,I have not received this book as of this date 01 16 2013I hope it arrives soon then I will let you know how I like it.
1,This movie made me hungry for fruit roll-ups,when the gore looks like fruit roll-ups and that liquid candy. Then it really sucks.No this movie is beyond sucks. Fake-butt explosions and everything.come on now give me a break!
1,Feeding you some Crap!,I will not attemp to go much into this movie because it really had nothing to offer. Its just another low budget horror movie that does not deliver. You have bad acting and bad effects with a plot with more holes in it than Swiss Cheese. I just had a hard time watching this one. I so tired of people putting out low budget zombie flicks and just hoping the public will buy it. I guess I was desperate and did. Do not fall victim to the cover or story line. This movie offers nothing and you receive nothing in return. Just turn your back on this one and be thankful you did not watch it. I wish I had.
1,If you see this movie run...run fast and hard and never look back!,"My wife and I were looking for a zombie movie at Hollywood Video one night and we figured any zombie movie would do. We had not yet been disappointed by a zombie movie and thought we never would be. I even expressed that out loud right before we watched this film.Ohhoho! I spoke to soon. I won't even bother reviewing the plot, cinematography, acting, score, or anything else that goes into making a film. I will just tell you that should you see this film at a rental place run fast, run hard, move out of the very state where you laid eyes on it, just make sure you get far, far away!Try renting Undead instead. That's a great zombie film which was made on (what I'm guessing to be) a similar budget but with a little something called talent."
3,A decent enough hors-d'ourve,"I agree with the one previous reviewer -- if you (as I did) liked the news reports from previous zombie films like ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the re-make of ""Dawn of the Dead"", this isn't at all a bad movie. Sure, the acting is bad, and the effects aren't great, but jeez - it's a low-budget film, for crying out loud. It's got quite a few good ideas and I'd love to see what the folks who made it would be able to do with a full-sized budget."
5,This movie rocks,"Beware the negative comments people have made about Feeding The Masses. This film is done in a Troma style. I guess that offends some mainstream film lovers. Yes this film was made on a low budget so the effects are poor. The thing most people are missing here is the social commentary. The very same thing that made people love Romero's films.Feeding The Masses has a message. It makes you think about what the Networks are shoving down our throats everytime there is a ""Crisis in the Gulf"" or a tragic storm.One reviewer said there was too much dialog?!? Well if you don't have a Resident Evil budget you need to use people talking. It's digital because digital is cheaper, and in this case digital gives the film a sense of realisim.If you liked Night and got the message of the original Dawn, watch this movie. No you won't see 3 million dollars worth of digital zombies attacking, no you won't see a hot babe running down the side of a skyscraper.You will see an epic zombie STORY."
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"I noticed this dvd at the video store and being an avid fan of this genre, was taken in by the graphics and ""testimonials"" on the cover. To infer this is ""superior"" in any way, shape or form to George Romero's zombie (at the time) trilogy is an insult to any true fan of this genre's intelligence. Low budget does not equal low quality and is not an excuse for poor filmaking not to mention wasting someones valuable time which this piece of crap does - ad nauseam."
2,Missed opportunity!,"This is just about the lowest budgeted movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, mostly dull dialogue and terrible sfx. The soundtrack was not too bad in comparison and it was used fairly within the context of the movie. However the message delivered by this film is very real and a serious issue in today's media controlled society. I really would like to see a serious higher budget remake of this movie and I believe that it would be a hit. Overall: MEDIOCRE!"
4,Feed me!,"Too many people expect the flashy CGI and big-time explosions you find in Hollywood movies. This film delivers incredible amounts on such a small budget. A terrific story poking fun at today's government, gore, humor! Look beyond the small budget on this one and you'll find a thought provoking, low budget masterpiece!"
1,junk,"Mutual fund basis calculations are broken, updates fail on the mac. Not to mention no state in this edition. It's absurd how many different versions of TurboTax there are this year. It almost takes longer to try to figure out which one to buy than it does to do your taxes. I'm done with TurboTax, switching to TaxCut"
2,NO STATE!,"Have used TurboTax for years with no real problems. The low rating is due to the following:Bought this in a store and discovered later when trying to download the state that it is FEDERAL ONLY! If I had known that I would have ponied up the extra minor $ in the store rather than the extra $30 for download.Last year the state was included with this version - this year Intuit's new fine-grained tiering of their product line ripped me off!Also, the price for this product is way too high, and the lack of an upgrade path is (pay less if you are a loyal customer) completely sucks. Intuit almost lost me a couple of years ago when they introduced product activation. They are in serious danger of losing me again."
1,I too was a moron to buy this ...,"No kidding, why no warning that this package does not include the state tax module? $29.95 more for the freaking state tax functionality."
2,not too good,This book has a great idea but the execution and the main gist of the book aren't too good. It's too political. Prayer seems to be a very small part of it and it's very dated. Oh well....
4,Great Book For starting out!,I love that the book assumes you know nothing about investment clubs & starts from the begining. It really breaks everything down for you.
4,Good lens for round about use.,"I decided on the Sigma 17-70 because of the extra speed with the /2.8. While using it at this aperture though, you won't get the sharpest images. It's not so much a dof / focusing issue, but rather a softness which can be noticed when compared to my 50mm prime. Other than that I am over the moon with this purchase. The lens is solid and feels great on the camera. It takes some getting used to when using the reverse zoom action. I keep turning the zoom ring the wrong way at key moments, but I'm learning to cope. Highly recommended. Only four stars because of the sharpness issue, which can be avoided by spending double your money, I'm sure!"
1,Dont buy !,"Before I bought the magazine it was rated as a 4 and that is why I bought it, and when I received it I was highly disappointed! This is playboy not a lingerie magazine to have just one photo and she is wearing a bra and panties. How does that get a rating of a 4? That was the worst photo of anyone I have seen in playboy! I wish I could get my money back."
2,Weak,"I have over 20 commentaries on First John. I consider this among the bottom five. Analysis is superficial and not particularly insightful. It might be an acceptable book for an introduction to First John, but if that's what you want, there are better books.If you are looking for solid introductory books, try Marshall or Smalley. If you are looking for deep textual analysis try Brown or Brooke. I don't agree with the positions taken by all of these authors, but their works are far more insightful then the Pillar book.I recently went back to college to audit a course where the Kruse book was a required text. Part way through the course, the professor apologized for using the book and said that in the future he will use a different book for First John."
1,What happened?,"What the hell was dj Odi thinking? I've seen him live and he rocked! It was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I bought this cd thinking it would be the same.I was VERY WRONG! Of course his skills were good, although I know he could've done much better,... They all sounded the same. It was more like trance than drum and bass. I was really dissapointed! I want to here what I heard in Seattle,WA at Playland 2! Now that was some excellent skills and dark hard sick beats!"
4,solid alblum,"I have been a big fan of Odi for several years now, and while this does not live up to many of his excellent mixtapes, it is still a decent cd. Comes from the same mold as most D&B nowadays, which was a little disapointing. But if your'e a fan of hard hitting jungle, give this a try."
1,What?!!,What the was DJ Odi thinking?I saw him ...and he rocked! I bought this cd thinking it would be like the set I saw. I was very wrong! In ...[person]I saw some of the best talent and heard the phattest cuts from him. Then I got this cd and was just dissapointed. All the cuts are the same and it sounds more like trance than d&b.
4,Never gets old....,"Whenever I listen to a certain CD, I put it away after hearing it once the whole way through. But when I hear this one, I could play it over and over again. I'm not sure what it is that Richard and the boys are doing, but it's right. This CD is superb."
1,Sent promotional copy of CD. Beware of this company.,"Sent promotional,""not for sale"" copy of CD. Also the CD case was cracked. I was not satisfied with this purchase even if it was just a few dollars."
5,Work great,Used these to pin a projector screen on my wall. The pins aren't as thick as they look in the picture but still thicker than ordinary tacks and plenty strong. One of them came with a missing cap but no other problems.
4,Alright thumb tacks,A few of the tacks broke when I tried to put them in a solid wood door. They work perfectly on drywall and maybe my expectations were too high for the solid wood thing...
2,Minor nouvelle vague thriller,"La Combat Dans L'Ile/Fire and Ice is a minor nouvelle vague political thriller from Alan Cavalier, who became overshadowed by his collaborators on this film, Louis Malle and Jean-Paul Rappeneau (Malle produced the film as a criticism of Jean-Luc Godard and other then-right wing nouvelle vague directors and their support for the French occupation of Algeria and for the OAS and their campaign of terrorism and assassination in mainland France). It's an okay romantic triangle of sorts, with Romy Schneider transferring her affections from Jean-Louis Trintignant's spoiled right wing terrorist to Henri Serre's left-wing printer, leading to a rather silly duel. It's dated better than most Nouvelle Vague films of its day, but still has the mixture of shallow content and unconvincing storytelling that is less import than the style of filmmaking."
3,Not kool,I think its pretty boring movie. Because to me it doesn't really deal with drugs all that much.And Kaley Cuoco's part is probably the only place where you see some drug.If you're like me I wanted to see how drugs affect people and what the outcome would be.But it doesn't have all that.Its not sexy neither.
1,Couldn't follow the plot,"This movie made absolutely no sense...I couldn't follow the story line, let alone understand what the movie was all about. I'm not sure what the plot or purpose of the picture was supposed to be because the movie was very scattered and the story line didn't make any sense. Also, there is way too much usage of inappropriate language in this film."
3,"Great writer, decent composer","ETA Hoffman was an excellent writer (see my review of the Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr). As a composer, however, he was slighlty less gifted. While he obviously possessed natural talent, his melodic and dramatic sense fall short of keeping me captivated. Nevertheless, he does have his exciting moments, as well as several homages to Mozart (most notably in the introduction of the first f-minor sonata, an imitation of Mozart's c-minor fantasy, K. 475). Four of his sonatas are filled with fugal portions, which may or may not entice the listener, depending upon his taste (I was not that fond of them). These 5 sonatas are played on a period intrument, giving them a more brilliant, if slighlt strange sound. if one buys this CD, they will hear pretty good music, but one will find amazing literature in his books."
4,A Must Read,"This book is a little hard to read due to the difference in the way folks spoke back then vs. now. This book showed me that the politics of the late 1700's and now aren't really that different. It was the haves vs. the folks who want to work to better themselves with policies made at the highest level to keep good hard working folk down. ""SOUND FAMILIAR""?"
3,Great history,This is a tremendously well researched book. It gives an account of all sides and causes of the rebellion. However it is a dry read. It feels like a textbook. I was hoping for it to flow a little better. Getting to the end felt like work more than enjoyment. If you want an accurate depiction of the causes of the rebellion this is a must read. If you are looking for entertainment along with good history than pass on this one.
4,fascinating history,"A very interesting history of an early period in American history, showing that many of our problems today had their beginning in the beginning of the country."
2,"Good for academics, boring for casual readers","Reading history can be a totally subjective experience. For one event you can be enthralled by the most banal details and in another event it can bore you to tears.The Whiskey Rebellion is the latter. When I pick up a book about the Whiskey Rebellion I, SUPRISE!, want to read about the WHISKEY REBELLION! There's way way too much background info that by the time you get to the actual rebelling you don't even care anymore.History wonks will love it but I can't recommend for the casual readers."
1,Not well written,"More like a term paper or thesis than a published book, did not enjoy at all, was a burden to read"
4,"Good, but dry at times.","This book was a mix of extremely good and sometimes boring content. The author includes very interesting sections at the beginning of each chapter that give the reader insight and context for the events within the chapters.The author also exposes the rough life of the frontiersmen, and the darker side of George Washington. Some sections of the book however, go on and on about the politics and the moving and shaking behind events and end up being more dry and boring than informative and interesting. These sections could use a brushing up."
1,"Not worth it, unless...","...you are building one of the ship models included. Even then, there is not likely to be much insight into a specific kit mentioned. All the subjects that would be of interest to a beginner are given short shrift and little in the way of expansion or illustration, and the comments regarding tools, glues and paints are so general as to be worthless. The few color panels are of completed models, but offer little in the way of detail or enlightenment. The photography isn't even that good. As a beginner to tall ship modeling, I wasted my money on this book. I feel mislead as the title and description implies that there is more here than the previous edition released just a year earlier. The ""New"" is of little value compared to the original Period Ship Handbook. Save your money and buy that one instead."
1,Rehash Rip Off,"Don't bother with this one! I have the author's 1st book, Period Ship Kit Builder's Manual, and it's a good intro to building wood model ships. This ""New"" book offers absolutely nothing new. I got it because I'm building the HMS Mars kit, and it is one of the ""model projects"" featured in the book. Very misleading! The book offers no insights on the build, but rather simply restates the instructions that came with the kit! Almost verbatim!"
1,Broke after two months of use.,We loved this corkscrew--it opens wine bottles pretty effortlessly--until it broke about TWO MONTHS after purchasing. The shaft split vertically in two. This is a very flimsily made product.
3,Easy opener,My wife complained about the difficulty with using several different types of openers until we found this type. We had one crack as well but it is still the easiest to use. I just bought two of them in case another cracks. It cost less than a good bottle of wine.
5,"Big and bold, brash yet beautiful Brit Babes","From the start, this is not a boring Britpop album. It's full of feeling and energy right from the awesome 'PVC' and 'People we want' through to the close harmony of 'Acetone' at the end, which makes you wish the album wasn't ending. But wait.. There's a bonus track, which really shows the whole spirit of the band. Excellent"
4,Great stuff,"Great album: catchy hooks, good tone and fun smart lyrics. Almost every song is a winner, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different yet still approachable sound. This is the only K I have, but it makes you want to hear more."
3,"Great Service, wrong book","I had fast, friendly service; however, I received a book that came with an expired serial code. If you need a book with a serial number because you will be graded on your progress, you should buy brand new. Beware: The publishing company my school went thru sent a bunch of brand new books without CDs or serial numbers. Make sure you have both and they're brand new if you're being graded. You should also have internet connection when using this program. Otherwise, great product! :)"
1,beware of pricing,I received the book in a timely mannor but it needed a code to be purchased that would double what the college book price would have been. I found this out a month after the purchase due to class schedule so could not return my purchase. I would like to warn of high prices on this suplier.
1,Not For Me,These run very narrow in the toe area and although I have really liked Anne Klein shoes in the past these do not fit me.
1,She's right - they're too tight!,"They are certainly pretty, but too tight across the toe box and the sides flare out. I'm just sorry that I threw them in my gym bag to wear for the day and since I was stuck wearing them I don't feel right returning them. St. Vincent de Paul's will have to find them a new owner!"
3,Boring!,I'm a mom of a toddler so I don't have time to mince words. My two year old was very bored with this. I was disappointed that there were no live humans speaking the words just a narrated voice of Pim the panda. It's unfortunate that I haven't yet found any great italian dvd's for young children.
1,no more pim,"my grandchildren will not even watch these videos. Poor animation, the words are said too quickly so you never really quite hear them or understand them. Not cohesive. I do not recommend."
3,"Good, but expected better","I wanted to help teach and expose my two young children (2 and 3 years old) to Japanese since I speak it but my spouse does not. I loved the idea of this DVD series covering topics only related to young children (as opposed to playing a second language learning DVD geared towards adults). However, I expected the DVD to show Japanese children speaking Japanese or at least have a Japanese setting, but the video clips only showed American children with romanized subtitles displayed on each clip. I was disappointed that their method of language learning was disassociated with culture, and that they didn't use the Japanese hiragana characters when spelling the words/phrases. Although children can still pick up words and their meanings through watching the DVD, I was disappointed at how it didn't feel ""Japanese"" at all."
4,Great video,"I like this video, as well as my 14 month old. He often goes to the entertainment center and grabs it so we will play it for him. I like that it has English subtitles, especially for my husband who does not speak any Italian. We've been watching the video together as a family. I think the pronunciations are accurate and my son enjoys the ""real people"" in the video (as opposed to it being all cartoon). Looking forward to getting more of these videos in the future!"
5,My husband loves it,He loves his bag and all of the compartments. He has room for everything that he needs when he's on the course.
4,Boston novel of manners,"This is a ""society"" novel set in Boston near the turn of the (20th) century. Hugh Blaisdale imagines he loves Priscilla Avery, but she sees through his insincerity and rejects him. He marries another and when she dies, the question is now will he get Priscilla? The answer is still ""no,"" when she marries the idealistic and much more honest Henry Sumner. A pretty good novel, despite some silly scenes (much ado about nothing). Also the satire is fairly mild where it could have been much sharper. Grant is a good ""old-fashioned"" writer, though."
5,Gotta love when a classic game is expanded and updated!,"I don't own this product yet, but I've watched videos about it and read up on the new rules and additions to this version of the game.There is enough here to not only make for an exciting new experience which captures the spirit of the original Monoply; there is also enough of a difference to give the real experts in the original version pause as they have to rework their entire winning strategy. This will give newer players a bit more of an even footing, which is good for everybody.I plan on picking up this, as well as a few of Winning Moves' other games like Super Scrabble and some of the card games they carry. It looks like these products are all capable of giving countless hours of fun and relaxation for the investment!"
3,Plastic Pieces,"I was excited to give this gift to my husband. He loves monopoly. Each monopoly has an additional property. There are $1000 dollar bills. I was disappointed with the hotels, houses and skyscrapers. They look metallic on the box cover (like they are in the deluxe edition). But they're actually plastic (a definite step down from the deluxe edition).More to come after we play the game ...."
5,mega fun,"Mega Monopoly is a terrific improvement on the traditional monopoly. It may take a game or two really understand the new strategy that comes with this game but much more fun. Also, with the speed dice, this game doesn't take all night. I d=absolutely recommend the new mega."
3,Not what I expected,This video is more of a travel log and not much about PanAM Clippers. I was expecting more video and info on the aircraft themselves.
3,Pan Am: The Golden Age of Aviation,"This is 2-DVD set of 293 min. Disc 1: Mexico, Hawaii, Mexico City, South America, Cuba. Disc 2: England, Ireland, Norway, France, Rome. Also on Disc 2, ""a brief history of Pan Am, with a special section on Pan Am's significant contribution to America's WWII war effort."" Mainly mid-1940s to early-1950s sights & sounds at each port of call (little aircraft footage). An interesting travel back in time.Pan Am called each aircraft a ""Clipper."" If you are interested in the CHINA CLIPPER, I recommend the DVD ""China Clipper: Pan Am's Conquest of the Pacific,"" also available at this website."
1,This is really a bad product,"This two disc set comes in a beautifully embossed, metal case. After that, it is all downhill. Basically, the video is composed of travelogues from the thirties. Although in color, it does not provide much information about the clippers. Also, there is a very, very brief documentary about the airplanes, but it is not much. I would not recommend this video."
5,Total Full-Immersion!,"...If You, as me, love Islay and its whisky and roundabout, you must buy both the DVD dedicated to Islay.here you step into a deep descent into Islay world.Many aspect was captured by great image and videos, accompained by a great music and editing.Excellent image quality and a good timing let you entertain Islay, and for who was been there almost one time, it miss more than before, and for anyone who never been there, desire of a travel increase incredibly.An excellent purchase of a professional product.You learn so much think, right for the passionist than for the expert.In One word:BUY!"
3,Islay Festival DVD,"Very interesting, lovely scenery, learned a lot about malt whiskey. Not being a whiskey drinker, I was mainly wanting to see more of Clann an Drumma, the featured band. I saw them live at the Scottish Games at Grandfather Mountain, N.C. and they were awesome! I have since found their website and will order their CD's from there."
3,What A Mess,"I'm on my second nib for this pen after the original clogged up and could not be restored. I'm having the same leakage problems that I experienced with the original nib. The pen slowly and intermittently leaks ink where the nib screws into the pen body. Every 5th or 6th time I uncap it, there is one or two drops worth of ink to clean up on the base of the nib. Otherwise, I enjoy using this pen for sketching immensely. But unfortunately, when this second nib fails, I'll be looking elsewhere for a technical pen, even if I have to settle for a larger diameter. Paying this kind of money for a pen and a replacement nib only to have the same persistent problem is unacceptable."
1,Reproachable,"This book is an exercise in character assassination. The workis plagued by erratic, unsubstantiated conclusions, gross inaccuraciesand a jagged, occasionally chaotic writing style. Ebhard Jackel has a nasty habit of generalizing and jumping from point to point without offering the necessary expansion of his theories. Even the footnotes are vague. The author, almost without exception, cites other literary works as ""proof"" of his conclusions. This type of circular logic is not becoming of professional historians or even writers in general...There are much better critiques of Irving's work than the one mentioned here. Amazon should be commended for offering literary works with alternative viewpoints. END"
5,Solid Work,"Sigh. I see the Holocaust deniers and quibblers are out in force here. Irving is ""courageous"" and a victim of ""censorship"" because he is harshly criticized and dismissed by all reputable historians. Sure.Contrary to what you may have read in the preceding reviews here, Jackel is a very reputable historian, the author of two invaluable and highly regarded works (""Hitler's Weltanschauung"" and ""Hitler in History"") that are required reading for anyone who studies Nazi Germany. There is nothing outlandish or shabby in his current book criticizing Irving--it is in fact rock solid, like all his other work. This compact, admirable volume makes a good companion to Richard J. Evans's effective debunking of Irving."
2,A hodgepodge mystery...,"I thought this novel had great promise when I first started reading it, with the marriage of modern day and historical witchcraft practices and discrimination, anthropology, small town suspicions, and a gruesome murder in a remote Scotthish location. I felt that the entire storyline just dissolved about half way through the book, with no clear direction of plot or character. It also didn't help that I thought the main character to be wholly unbelievable and even a litle bit annoying with her irrational outbursts and sexual escapades with both genders. It seemed to me that the auther tried a little too hard to add twists and turns to his novel to keep the reader's interest going, but in the end had so many loose ends to tie up that it was completely unsatisfying."
3,"Uneven, unsatisfying, but unusual","It took some work to get through this, principally because the ending was not only a complete change of tone from the rest of the book, but felt rushed and contrived. This is a by the numbers book with a few well drawn characters, a completely cardboard villain, and a suitably modern heroine whose moral, intellectual, and sexual ambiguity is supposed to hook us into her world-weary view. Unfortunately, a little of that goes a long way, and Terry Williams comes off too often as a selfish, self-aggrandizing whiner. Consequently, rooting for her in her final ordeal is sort of pro-forma. ""The Death Pit"" makes the Wiccans look good, the police look like idiots, and contains at least one satisfying plot twist. This story had a good premise but could have used *one* more rewrite, a little tightening here and there, and a lot more sweetening."
3,A Potluck of a Potboiler....,"Wanna sell entertainment to the US mass market? Here's what you do: make it a mystery novel with some steamy sex (both lesbian and bi-sexual). Add some witchcraft, some torture, some gruesome descriptions of dean humans and animals, covens of witches, and a baby-selling ring. Toss in some poverty in some far-away place like Romania. Then set the whole thing in a remote Scottish town, and let the plot expand to encompass all of the aforementioned ingredients for, say, 400 pages. Give it a sensational name like ""The Death Pit"" and throw a few quotes on the cover like ""erotic energy"" and ""shocking secret"".And there you have it. No rhyme, reason, or discernable plot or theme. But it will make a heckofa grade B movie."
2,The author should just write for Hustler and get it over with,"I gave this book two stars because it is a bit of an interesting read. But as I read it through I realized that the author must be sexually repressed. The teen daughter seems to live for sexual encounters and it was just too weird when her brother pressured her for an encounter after he saw her 69ing in the woods with a strange man. The main character Terry leaves a party for a one nighter with her ex boyfriend from college and the middle aged man that she is renting a room from blasts her for being a ""bad example"" for his oversexed teen daughter. How weird is that, that a person renting a room in his house for a couple of weeks is supposed to act as an ""example"" for one of the guy's kids? The whole book just seemed to be repressed psychic junk in the author's head where he invents oversexed young female characters and then has them punished for their behavior anyway he can. Weird!!!!"
3,Catchy music but........,just one of those cds I rarely play. I need to listen to more of his stuff. He is talented.
4,what a fan wants,being a diehard christina fan i love all books about her.but i really liked this one.i felt it gave good information about her career and her life.i love the photos and in all i really enjoyed the book.i'd recomend this book to all people who love christina or people who would liek to learn more about her.because she is a wonderful singer and a great person!
5,This CD will change your life.......Period,"For starters putting Kenny Garrett and Kenny Kirkland in the same room is just asking for trouble. These two are some of the most harmonically complex players ever. They completely change how a minor blues is supposed to sound (Woodsteps). Kenny Garrett puts double harmonic minor (major scale with b2,b6) to use as only he can in Sing a song of song, giving it that middle eastern-walking-across-a-dessert-at-high-noon sound. If your trying to learn how to play outside and want to do it right, buy this cd. This is by far the best cd he has made."
4,"""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" meets ""The Full Monty""","Absolutely delightful fantasy about two clueless British guys trying to make it big in the film industry via a road less traveled. I found it hysterically funny. The juxtaposition of dry British humour with the production of a problematic porn film had me giggling helplessly. The best way I can describe this film is as a ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" meets ""The Full Monty"" kind of film. Seriously, I had to tape my ribs after watching this one. lol."
2,Save your money - i was disappointed,i got this movie used because of carmen electra in the title role. the movie is english with accents and english type humor and carmen is only in the movie about 10 minutes total. even used for a couple bucks it isn't worth it. if you want a good comedy with carmen electra tryMating Habits of the Earthbound Humans. other decent movies w/ carmen electra areRent ControlandGetting Playedand of courseScary Movie
4,A handy guide for the contemporary gentleman,"This is the sort of book interesting only to those people serious about self-perfection. The book offers easy and handy tips for how to behave as a gentleman -- and far from the typical GQ/Maxim/Men's Health ideal of manhood, this book aims to help the reader achieve refinement and dignity. ""A gentleman,"" as the author puts it, ""is someone who makes others feel comfortable."" ""His goal is to make life easier, not just for himself but for his friends, his acquaintances, and the world at large."" Nothing in here about how to flatten your abs in three weeks, succumb to the latest fashion trend or technological fad, or get 'her' into bed. But neither is this book simply moralistic. Rather than ethics, it is concerned with manners and maintaining a decent, honest, and caring public persona.I think it's unfortunate statement on our contemporary society that such a book needs to be read; but it is encouraging that people may read it."
4,How to Be a Gentleman,"Finally something is written to help teach a man, hopefully a young man (catch him when he is young - no bad habits) the proper ways to conduct himself and the way he should show respect for others. My son received this as a gift. We have both read it and are glad he has it. He has learned about everything from how to shake hands, how to introduce someone and why he should carry a handkerchief."
2,Offensive,"I purchased this book as a general guideline to becoming a finer gentleman. There are a few things I read in this that is downright offensive and insulting. The book goes on to say things like ""a gentleman never drinks from the milk container"" and things like "" don't joke about not being a bomber at an airport before your flight. I especially liked the "" if you are at someones home and there isn't any ash trays provided, don't ash in a potted plants or saucers.There is an illustration on how to tie a bow tie, but the book doesn't cover any other tie knots. So basically the author thinks you should already know how to tie a necktie but not to ash in plants. I would not buy again, I need a book on etiquette that is designed for people who already show a basic level of class. I thought as though I was being talked down to the entire time. Take out all the condescending nonsense and this would be an excellent book."
3,It was good...,"It was a good book and had a lot of information on how to act like a true gentleman, but I wish there was a little more information in the book."
3,Like everyone else says,"This is a mix of good and not so good. I would say go to the library, read it and if you think it is something you need then buy it. There is very little in here that you could not find with a bit of effort elsewhere.... at least as far as the good information."
2,Rather patronizing,"Somewhere around page one of this book, you begin to feel John Bridges thinks he's writing for a child. Every paragraph begins with, ""A gentleman knows..."", ""A gentleman wears..."", ""A gentleman thinks..."" You could swap out, ""A gentleman"" with ""Timmy the Turtle"" and complete the inference.Didn't anyone suggests to Mr. Bridges that there where other, less redundant ways to handle this repetition?And drinking beer from a can?!?!For a much more interesting read, check out, ""The Book of Good Manners"" by Lord Chesterfield. To get the same information presented in this book; but better written, shorter and with humor, read Scott Omelianuk and Ted Allen's ""Things a Man Should Know (about style)."""
3,Good Start. The Rest Is Up To You.,"Just like any other well-meaning book merely devised as a guide instead of absolute gospel, Bridge's little opus sticks to the point and belays the details.Every single piece of advice and every single rule are valuable things to take heart. It's simple and quick, telling you what to do and/or how to do it yet seldom, if ever, explaining why. The whys and why-nots are basically all just common sense deductions anyway. It took me one night to go through every word. Now I can just keep it on hand for future reference.As a few other reviewers have mentioned, some of the entries are ""take it or leave it,"" meaning don't follow whatever nuggets of knowledge you don't like. None of it is brain surgery anyway - but nice little reminders on how to do the right things are keys to following the straight and narrow roads hard travelled."
4,Good source for information,"While no book is really the end all be all in any topic, this book does give a great deal of information. Bridges, while not Emily Post, does cover topics that one my encounter in everyday life. He writes in an easy to read style that makes reading effortless.He calls his book a Gentlemanners book, and I must agree. As he offers suggestions for behaviors at sporting events, parties, introductions, when to write thank you notes, and so much more. This book would be good as a college graduation present for someone just starting out on their own in the adult world."
5,"Small book, but packed full of timeless etiquette!","I am a woman, and I enjoyed this book! Men, believe me, it does make a difference to women when we cross paths with a man who handles himself in a proper manner. Etiquette is something that will never go out of style. On my job, I have seen many smiles on women's faces because a man held the door open or stepped aside so that she may enter the elevator first. Thank you Mr Bridges for writing a book that is enjoyable and easy to read."
2,Over Rated Not Much Substance,"I was very dissappointed. Take away the words ""a gentleman"" and the book is reduced in half. Take away those things we all know and you have a pamphlet. It seems to add nothing new. The only thing I truely liked is the illustrations on tying a bow tie."
4,Book for a gentlemen.,I think this is a good book for people that does know how to be a gentlemen but I found I knew most of the stuff already.
3,A mixed bag,"A portion of the book is common sense, a portion gives practical guidelines for entertaining, a portion is about consideration for others and a portion is simply archaic or outright sexist. The book opens rather condescendingly with ""There comes a time in every mans life when his mother is not around any more"". There follow recommendations for being thoughtful of others, how to set a dinner table and for some reason a note on lowering the toilet lid whenever a female may be near. This item in particular, given the changes in sexual politics over the years, suggests that females are not sufficiently adroit to operate a toilet lid. Other questionable advice includes the admonition to read the New York times at least three times a week, this being more of an imposition of a political stance than a point about the merits of being well read. Still, the book offers enough valuable advice to make it worth the time to read."
1,Foolish beyond belief,"Although there are a few bits of useful information spinkled herein, they are inconsistent. Much of the ""information"" appears to be directed to barbarians (e.g., a gentleman doesn't pick his nose in public). A better book, by far, would give some rationale for why we should or shouldn't do certain things. A gentleman doesn't waste money on this book."
3,A Good Start,"Mr. Bridges gives a good starting step for guys who wish to learn proper etiquette. This book is a collection of short proverb-like rules mixed along with some short case-scenarios. Both the rules and the scenarios are quite enlightening. However, on the one hand, I feel that some of the rules are too specific, and on the other hand, I wish the book were at times more detailed. Even though I realize this would make the book lengthier (and possibly less interesting), it would be nice to know some more. For example, ""a gentleman knows how and under what circumstances to send flowers."" I'd like some examples here.Life experience is the best teacher, but you want to start in the right direction. This book points you in that direction and guides you in your first steps.This book is easy to read and understandable. I actually found myself finishing it in one night. I would recommend it to anyone who would like a general primer of proper conduct."
3,"Some Right, Some Wrong","I must absolutely agree with the reviewer who said that many of the author's ""rules"" of etiquette are merely preferences, not actual indicators of gentlemanly virtue. For example:1) On page 24, Bridges claims: ""A gentleman tucks his undershirt into his undershorts."" I think that most gentleman can agree that such an arrangement makes one a dweeb, not a gentleman.2) On page 129: ""A gentleman reads a daily newspaper, preferably the New York Times, at least three times a week."" A gentleman will, for various reasons, have a good knowledge of current events at all times. However, a gentleman will be readily able to find a daily newspaper of his own preference.Overall, Bridges' book is a good primer for young men who wish to be gentlemen; if nothing else, his instructions will give readers an overall sense or spirit of what it means to be gentlemanly, and is worth reading. Readers should, however, keep in mind that Bridges does, indeed, add a number of his own opinions."
2,A simple book.,"A couple of interesting details here and there, a simple reference book for the occasional gentleman."
1,Awful,"I was looking forward to reading this, instead,it was the most patronising book that I have ever read, avoid it like the plague. It even tells you to say please and thank you.Even a child knows that this is common courtesy anyway."
4,"Australian Music, performed on an Australian piano","Ian Munro performs interesting piano pieces on the new Stuart piano at Newcastle University Conservatorium. This new piano has special materials, handcrafted in Australia, which include Tasmanian Huon Pine, which is intended to enhance dynamic range and sustain qualities. The instrument is best heard live, though.This was the first commercial CD to feature the Stuart piano, which has an extra 9 notes, so that the instrument is an 8 octave piano from F to F.Munro plays works by 12 Australian composers, including himself.Standout tracks include:The 5 Bagatelles by Carl VinePeter Sculthorpe's SimoriMartin Wesley-Smith's WaltzWarmly recommended"
4,welcome to the future!,"This is not an easy film to classify. It hovers in a strange realm between traditional sci fi action film and slower, more cerebral and arty science fiction fare such as SOLARIS.Peter Phelps is a hugely likable actor. His central performance dominates the film and he shows he is fully up to the task of carrying a major motion picture; he has a lot of scenes where he is alone and they never drag on into dullness. Why he isn't as big of a star as Russell Crowe is a mystery.The ""future world"" scenario that ZONE 39 presents is rendered well within the confines of the tight budget; this movie really shows what a dedicated production team can do in conjunction with a tightly written script. Nothing is attempted that cannot be pulled off convincingly.The ending is bit rushed, though."
4,Written in Stone : Public Monuments in Changing Societies,"The author of Written in Stone attempts the task of interpretting monuments in changing societies. Often one does not think about how monuments hold one moment in time stagnant, yet socieites change and the monuments usually still stand. Levinson utilizes a wide variety of examples to look at the question of monuments in changing societies. Levinson's book is the first substanitial work of I seen written on the subject of monuments when societies change and it is likely not to be the last. For further reading Levinson's footnote are well done."
1,England travel guide,"I want my money back. Poorly organized, no index, doesn't have a map of England, no road maps. Without a doubt the worst travel guide I've ever used"
5,England Country Travel Guide,This book has so much information of England including places to see and visit. The only part missing I think is some caravan sites etc.
2,NOT The Clear Model Shown,"I ordered the CLEAR Screwpull Trilogy foil cutter as shown in this listing. The one I received is NOT clear. It is black plastic. If you are trying to match other CLEAR Screwpull kitchen utensils, do NOT order this one."
5,Very good read!,I liked this book a lot. It was very good and hard to put down. You should read other books by this Author. I enjoyed it a lot.
4,My first from this author but not my last,"Good, fast read, researched well enough so you got a good feel for everyone involved. Will be reading this author again"
2,"Get an editor, please!!!","NEVER LEAVE ME did, in fact, make a boring airplane trip pass more quickly but that is ALL the praise I can give. The writing is about the worst I have ever read. Clearly the writer has a poor editor, is his own editor (and doesn't have a command of English grammar) or does not even have an editor. The text is replete with glaring errors, lame descriptions, boring repetition and confused storytelling. I could go on and on. As for the story, it was mostly forgettable for me because the writing was so weak and awkward. As a genre, true crime books are not usually penned by great writers, in my opinion. But this book was just so bad."
3,"Fairly good, but not the best writing","I read all other reviews of this book before I ordered it, but the story (which I was not familiar with) sounded interesting and I am a true crime reader, so I ordered it. I do wonder how well these St. Martin's True Crime Library books are edited. There are typos and some inconsistencies in the details presented by the author, but these are probably ""picky"" criticisms on my part. I had not read John Glatt prior to this book, but I don't think I'll be seeking out other books of his. I just did not subjectively enjoy his writing style."
3,Standard Paperback True Crime,"This is the sort of book you find for sale at an airport magazine story, designed to be easily and quickly digested in the space of a plane trip. The story itself is not particularly memorable, in fact it has a depressingly familiar quality to it. Older slightly dweeby guy seeks a young bride from another country then proceeds to dominate her to keep her dependent on him, wife tries to break free, husband kills her.If you are a fan of true crime this is a fun read. It doesn't transcend the genre or break new ground but it doesn't claim to."
3,Yawn III,Yippe Vol. II. Another compilation that reshuffles the track arrangement from its American counterpart - Why Vol. 2?
3,Showcases the bands Ballads.,"This album showcases some of the songs that were hits in the '80s for the band Chicago, It includes many hits such as ""Will You Still Love Me?"" which hit Number 3 in early 1987 and ""You're The Inspiration"" which hit Number 1 in 1984. To most people fond of ballads you will like this collection very much but to people who are fans of Chicago you will find this collection to be very incomplete and you may want to just wait to see if they come out with a better ""Greatest Hits""."
2,Is This What This Group Will Be Remembered For?,"Chicago will probably be remembered for these cuts rather than their early work when they were one of the hottest rock acts in the country. This group was unfairly maligned in the 70's but they were one of the pioneers of incorporating a brass sound into rock. This sound has disappeared from the work, particularly after Terry Kath's passing, and all that is left of this group are mellow love songs. This CD places too much emphasis on the middle to later work. Try the original CDs ""CTA"", ""II"", ""III"", ""VI"", or ""IX"" for starters. Fortunately, this group's album titles are easy to remember. Those CDs showed a lot more of their rock and brass work, as well as a greater degree of experimentation."
5,One of the Windy City's best exports,"Arguably the most consistent and enjoyable rock band -if not as groundbreaking as- The Beatles, Chicago sums up some of their best moments on this entertaining compilation. 70's classics like ""Saturday in the Park,"" ""Colour My World,"" and ""If You Leave Me Now"" never go out of style; ditto for the slicker 80's pop of ""Hard Habit to Break"" and ""Hard to Say I'm Sorry."" We're even treated to two strong new cuts, ""Here in My Heart"" and the Lenny Kravitz-produced ""You're the One."" Of course, with songs like ""Baby What a Big Surprise"" and ""Feelin Stronger Everyday"" missing, Volume II is a necessity as well, but by the time you have both you have 31 one of the best-loved songs by one of music's best-loved bands. Enough said."
3,Do We Need Another Compilation?,"It depends. If you haven't got any Chicago CDs. Definitely, yes. If you only have original albums and has no compilations resounding yes. But if you are a Chicago fan since the 70s and has most of the albums get it if you like. This compilation has most of the Chicago hits and has most of my favorites and 70s hits such as Make Me Smile, Just You'n Me and Saturday In The Park are there, too. Selections are mostly ballad hits, such as If You Leave Me Now, You're The Inspiration, and Hard To Say I'm Sorry. But most of my grumbling came from the fact that 90s effort with the exception of two previously unreleased songs is missing from this compilation."
4,Great Collection,"This volume one collection is might fun indeed. It's nostalgic and fun. All of the hits are on here. Volume 2 is even better. One is reminded how great and powerful Peter Cetera's voice is. It is easily one of the most instantly recognizable voices in music. It was Cetera who lead the band into the greatest success they've ever seen and, by the way, haven't seen much of since he left. They replaced him with Jason Scheff. It's kind of funny at how much Scheff sounds like Cetera. Some times you swear it was Peter doing it. I guess the band knew they needed a 'voice'. It's almost mind boggling at how much Cetera gets bashed on other pages. He has a brilliant voice and gave the success to the band. If you diss Cetera, you diss the band in every form it's come in. Anyways, this is a great collection. Every thing after Cetera left is not worth buying."
1,Ernest and Elston,The story is nice. I bought it used and the book was supposed to be in good condition. Every page was torn and wrinkled. I was very disappointed in the condition that I received the book. It was in terrible shape.
5,Terrific,"I like the songs in this cd because they are all the songs we sing at Mass, I also play it while distributing the body of Christ to the local hospitals."
5,Excellent,"Table of Plenty is an excellent rendition of songs, which are some of my favorites used in the (Catholic) Mass, many bringing me to tears. I believe everyone can enjoy this collection of songs. I highly recommend this album."
2,"""Table of not enough""",My original CD had 16 tracks - this CD with same name and same cover plate only has 10 songs/tracks
4,Love the leafless trees,"The trees are great for hiding the on and off switches to the houses. Since the ""road"" arrives tightly rolled, I had trouble flattening it and I didn't use the ""snow"" at all as I have my village set up on white, used what is intended as the overhead light panel which gives a subtle glistening effect like snow. The two ""winter"" trees are nicely detailed with flexible branches so may be made ""skinny"" or in fuller shape."
2,Beatles Lunch box,"This lunch box has great graphics and is a good size. However, it doesn't close tightly and is somewhat flimsy, probably because the hinge isn't long enough and leaves open gaps."
4,rivet failure,"Cool lunchbox. Good size. Throw it in the back pack and my PBand J doesn't get smooshed.However not as well made as the boxes we used to carry back in the sixties. Thinner metal I thinkHad a rivet failure the first week - easy to pop another rivet in though with a rivet tool, or if you don'thave one you could put it together with a screw and nut which in the long run might hold up better."
5,Trabajo en Equipo !!,Un pueblo sin nombrar cual sea este cosa muy comun en saramago... se ponen de acuerdo hartos del pasado y de los gobiernos que los han oprimido y en las elecciones siguientes acruan de manera general votando por quien mas los convencia....El Voto BLanco!!como un pueblo con su organizacion bien fundada solo en las ganas de hacer las cosas y sin el yugo del gobierno opresor ni policia es necesaria!!Interesanete de leer sobre todo cuando las elecciones se aproximan..
5,Passed with 900+ on both Core and O/S exams,"Wow, Passed both examed with better than 900. After failing the O/S exam using someone elses material I found this book to get right to the point for the exams. I would recommend it to anyone looking to pass A+ on the first time out."
5,Excellent and Thorough,"This book contains everything you'll need to know to pass the A+ exam! At over 1,000 pages, it should! I read this book and was totally impressed with not just the text, but also the photos and screenshots. The glossary also weighs in at 30 pages, a must for those of us who need a little more explanation on certain terms. If you are trying to pass the A+ exam, I'd say this could well be your one and only stop for book purchases."
2,Wont buy another title from Marcraft,"The book was easy to read and understand. Some of the the questions in the ""apply your knowledge"" section lacked some accuracy, as if the questions were written by someone who hadn't read the text. In one instance a graphic was omitted that rendered the review questions useless.I did pass the tests, but I will buy from a different company next time."
4,Good big reference,"I just passed (January 2003) both A+ exams, using this book as one of my references. It is a solid, comprehensive book. I would recommend using this book as a supplement to one or more of the slim A+ Adaptive Exam books by either Meyers or Crayton."
2,"Good info, but no fun to read","This book has a ton of great information, and will get you ready for the exam. Unfortuntly, many of the chapters repeat information from previous chapters. There are some sentences that are verbatim out of earlier chapters. This makes the book boring and a chore to read. This book provides no real insight into the material"
1,broken,one cork pulled out pretty easily - and then i could not get the cork off the screw. after many attempts i finally was able to remove the corkscrew from the body and then remove the cork - and now i can't get the corkscrew back into the handle with the ball on it. seems to now be useless. pretty disappointing.
1,Broke Already,"Our previous last cork screw lasted years. This one did not last three months. The side of the corkscrew cracked opening a bottle, I bet it did not open 25 bottles before it broke. Another inferior China product."
3,Feels Cheap; Works Well,"Works well with pulling corks, but it feels very cheap and flexible. For its price, I expected more.Go with a cheaper version or a more expensive version. This lands somewhere in limbo."
4,Simple but reliable corkscrew,"Screwpull Trilogy Table Corkscrew has proven, so far, to be an effective and reliable gadget. While inserting the screw into the cork, it leverages the cork out gently and completely, without requiring great force for the final stretch' as several other devices do. Yet the construction is simple, with few moving parts, which seems to ensure a reasonable duration of usage. The latter aspect, however, has yet to be proven, since the number of bottles opened so far is modest. Several other gadgets, while cheaper, tend to break down after few uses. Hopefully this one has overcome this hassle."
5,Screwpull Wine Opener from Amazon,I always had trouble opening wine bottles. Not anymore. This wine opener is very easy to use. The service was excellent. Amazon is turing out to be my number one shopping stop. You can find everything and at a good price.
3,pc,"Although the read kept one entertained, the ending was a great disappointment. Putting it all together, nothing was ever concluded."
5,Impressive and Strange,"The book starts out grounded in reality, and then slowly becomes less grounded until it starts to fly. An enjoyable story and a fascinating belief structure fill the pages. Try it."
2,Poor Scholarship,"Judging by the cover, Through the Crosshairs appears to be a timely discussion of the history of sniper operations. Unfortunately, Mr. Dougan does a poor job of ensuring that his historical information is correct. Perhaps worst of all, Mr. Dougan's style makes his work conspiracy theory as much as scholarly research. Dougan's outrageous claim that John Allen Muhammad was a United States Marine is ridiculous and insulting. Shame on the publisher for ever allowing this book to hit the streets."
3,Mouse Trap,"It's interesting to review a book a year after having read it, and without studying parts of it again....kind of highlights the overall significance, or lack of it. The best part of this book was the first half...Eisner's climb to the top, and inside stories on other big names in the business. Like most of these tales, very little of the behavior seems to be rational or fair...just greedy and petty. In the end this bogs down the story, especially the endless detail on Eisner's fight with Katzenberg. Overall, I guess I'm glad I read it, as I think Kim Masters paints a fairly authentic picture of what its like inside Hollywood. But I would only recommend it to people who are fanatics on the entertainment industry."
2,Don't cancel your Disney World vacation yet.,"A better title for this book would have been ""The Last Man Standing: How Michael Eisner Never Lost His Grip and 446 Pages Explaining Why."" The last time I checked, Michael Eisner was still the CEO of Disney and there were no movements afoot to replace him. These facts alone make this book anticlimactic.To be honest, I only purchased this book because I'd read about Jeffrey Katzenberg's settlement and I wanted to know how a man who never attended college could come to be worth so much.Although reality disagrees with both the premise and the conclusion of the book, reading it was not a complete waste: I now know a great deal about the modern rise of Disney."
2,Missing Songs,The Soundtrack was a great disappointment. There was a scene in the movie with Tisha Campbell and Rusty Cundieff where she's posing for photos taken by him and a scene where they're sitting on the sofa watching TV and he places his head down on her lap. The song played in this scene was not on the soundtrack and I have no idea of who could have made the song. And some of the other songs that are on the soundtrack I don't remember even hearing them on the movie. What's up with that?
3,Essays on effective leadership,"Do you know how ancient authorities such as Plato or Machiavelli defined leadership? What about current historians and psychologists such as James MacGregor Burns or John W. Gardner? In this excellent compilation you are sure to find your philosophical kin. Editor J. Thomas Wren presents a series of thoughtful essays on every aspect of leadership by some of the world's greatest thinkers, from Aristotle to Gandhi, and Leo Tolstoy to W.E.B. Du Bois. Each essay seems indubitably to be the last word on leadership - at least, until you get to the next one. getAbstract recommends this book to CEOs, government officials, military commanders, clergy, supervisors, police chiefs and mayors - in short, anyone who leads others."
5,Fantastic Read!,This Leaders Companion is just a delight to read and easy to understand. Wren did an outstanding job covering a multitude of leadership topics! Fantastic Read!
2,Must Have for School,"This is a must have for school. If you are a history buff you will thoroughly enjoy, however, I'm not."
5,A different kind of movie.,"An unusual romantic comedy. If you really look at the plot, the movie could have been written for individuals of any culture. I enjoyed how they showed that African Americans not only come in diffrent hues, but different personality/cultural traites. Not all of us who love out culture are hip to the latest slang or want to be. Also, there was not nudity, guns, or violence(a very nice change from the norm).One of Tisha campbells better roles, the ensemble had great chemistry. I especially enjoyed the surprize ending."
4,"a cute love story, with comedy thrown in!","Sprung is the story of 4 friends Clyde (Joe Torry), Adina (Paula Jai Parker), Brandy (Tisha Campbell) and Montel (Rusty Cundieff) . Clyde and Adina who are both playas hook up immediately and Adina finds out that Clyde isn't the rich man she thought he was and hilarity ensues (check the scene with Clyde riding on top of Adina's car in only his jockey underwear). Meanwhile against Clyde and Adina's wishes, Brandy and Montel fall in love and are truly happy. Clyde and Adina conspire to break up their friends's happy relationship, accusing the twosome of being ""Sprung"". Overall this is a very sweet romance and it also very funny. I've worn out my video and recently purchased this on DVD and I""m quite happy I did and I think you should get it too!"
2,It had such potential,"Okay, so it wasn't exactly great, but I didn't hate it. Tisha campbell is pretty much playing that same ""Gina"" role only instead of a wise-cracking homeboy she is this time paired with an artsy type dude. This movie is about the two trying to make love work while their two jealous, and trifling, pals plot to split them up. And that Leonard Maltin review is dead wrong because this movie is NOT about their friends trying to plan a wedding. There is a wedding scene, but that is at the end of the movie and was more of a surprise ending than the central theme.Cundieff is certainly sincere in his role, but his character was uneven. His turns at trying to be hip and using slang fell flat. But contrasted with the horrible stereotypical performances of Parker and Torrey, I'd say that Cundieff was a welcome respite.On the whole this movie is worth renting if you just want something very light hearted and silly."
4,funny somewhat predictable movie,"i enjoy joe torry, paula jai patton, tisha campbell, john witherspoon, and rusty cundieff. this is a funny movie, a little overacted but it's entertaining! add this to your collection of black films!"
2,Title caught my attention,"The title caught my attention first. I own five or six of Gary Null's books. When I find another of his books that looks good I by it. It reads like a text book, it is very dry. The information is not new. It is a short book, good as a reference unless you are a nutrition nut. Sadly in this book, Gary is rehashing the beans. I'm disappointed when authors do this. A master nutritionist, he could do better."
2,Not as great as I thought it would be,"I bought the ""Treasury of Magical Knitting"" and this book. One would have been enough."
4,A good buy,"I was excited to get this book as I do a lot of different knitting.The instructions for the mobius scarf are good, however some of the patterns could be used without the mobius technique.Overall I'm glad I purchased the book."
2,Interesting but not enough good quality material for a full book,"Cat Bordhi is creative, innovative and enthusiastic so her books are a pleasant read. However, there is only so far one can push a single technique. The first bookA Treasury of Magical Knittingon this technique and this one should have been seriously edited and combined into one book of the same size. There is simply not enough meaty material for two books on this topic."
1,You have got to be kidding me!!,"People that would be a sucker to buy this would probably go buy a gold plated tin can, sure it's coated in gold, but it's still a tin can.Buying this cable doesn't make much more sense.A usb cable is a usb cable, and insulation and gold plating are just simply NOT neccessary, you would have to go through 6 regular cables before the purchase of this cable would be justified.As one of the other wise reviewers stated, Monster is notoriously overpriced, and are infamous for insulating and gold plating cables that quite frankly are just for looks and have no functional value what-so-ever."
4,Early Exposé of Nazi Tyranny,"""Hitler's Children"" is a 1943 B&W classic and based on Gregor Ziemer's book, EDUCATION FOR DEATH. It stars Bonita Granville and Tim Holt. As a anti-Nazi propaganda film, it was a huge hit in 1943, serving to motivate Americans and their Allies in the war effort. The film is a lurid and horrific take of life in Nazi Germany--exposing atrocities rarely known at the time. Major issues addressed: lebensborn (a Nazi initiated program that encouraged the ""racially pure"" to breed children for Hitler), forced sterilization, and Hitler Youth cruelty. A must-see for anyone who is interested in WWII history."
1,Americas Best Bed & Breakfast Lucien Maynard,I had the extreme misfortune to purchase both of the Maynards Books. The recipes are riddled with errors from Page 1 recipe 1 - example first recipe on Page 1 - 1 plus 2 Tablespoons of WHAT.AS IT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO RETURN BOOKS FROM SOUTH AFRICSA I AM DISGUSTED THAT PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS ARE ALLOWED TO PUBLISH WITHOUT CHECKING THE CONTENTS OF THESE BOOKS.OUR EXCHANGE RATE IS PROHIBITIVE SO IS THE POSTAGE. BOTH OF THE BOOKS PURCHASED ARE A DISGRACE TO THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY. WE DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE TIME TO PERUSE QUICKLY AND I CAN IDENTIFY AT LEAST 7 ERROS FROM PAGES 1 - 40 ON ONE OF THE BOOKS ONLY.
4,Reivew,"This is a very good,detailed book. It is arranged by state, so if you are looking for just breakfast items it might take a little while longer."
4,An unmached received product the one presented on Amazon cataloge,I have 3 Gerber multi-plier. I like this particular one hand opening style.Very good tuff steel althogh very brakeable.The 2 pliers I have bought resently are different then the one presented on the virtual cataloge. The knife part is completely different and I don't realy like it. I like the style of the one presented. I wish I could insert a picture of the one I have received to show what I mean.Too bad Amazon suplly stuff different than the one ordered.
3,Not what I expected,"The DVD is Excellent but I can't say the same for the printed material.The booklet is tiny, I need glasses to read it.The printed tab/music don't match the song as played/taught.I like to have either a tab or music in note form to refer to for learning the passages.I know, everyone will say, ""learn to hear the notes"" which is good if you can pick it up that fast.What I would like to see is a accurate PDF file that could be down loaded after you buy the DVD."
5,Introduction To The Psalms: A Song From Ancient Israel,"There are few scholarly works which are also as enjoyable to read as this introduction to the Psalms. Especially for those who have not considered their original context, this book brings a needed layer of depth and richness to the Psalm experience. I think college and seminary students will find this book exactly what they need."
5,Fantastic,"I have lots of Jimmy Smith's recordings , but to see this DVD was special because Jimmy Smith was and always be the very best on the the Hammond B-3 organ. He swings so hard in the groove you have to move and be amazed at his technical prowess and how he makes the blues so soulful and delicious! What he does with the music is so easy to listen to. Everyone whoever heard of Jimmy Smith should make this recording a part of their collection! He's the best - period! Go ahead on Jimmy!"
5,We love this book!,My two year old loves this sticker book! He loves choosing the stickers and putting them into place. Talking about what the different stickers are has really improved his language skills and he's also learning about shapes. Love this book!
5,Hours of Fun,"This is a fantastic interactive book! My 2 year old boy has spent hours on this book, learning vocabulary, counting, colors and shapes in the process. I highly recommend this book. Great for road trips, airplane rides, restaurants or just learning time at home."
1,my Giant Sticker Activity Book,"I received this book as a USED book when I bought it (I thought ) NEW ! Missing stickers, and torn pages. Horribly disappointed."
5,Online to purchase my 3rd one!,"My son has gone thru two of these books. He loves finding the stickers, matching them to the pictures and putting them in place. Not to mention he is learning colors, numbers, shapes, and the names of his favorite trucks. He mastered it at 2 and just finished the 2nd one at 2 1/2. I'm online as we speak to buy the 1000 sticker version! Hopefully this one will last more than three weeks!!"
2,Too big to be fun,"My children have enjoyed other similar sticker books, but this one is just too big, There are so many pages that it is very difficult to find the spot for the stickers--for example there are tons of circles and tons of different places they could go. Perhaps if each section were removable, it would be easier. Unlike other sticker books, this one doesn't have a number system for placing the sticker so you are on your own. It is possible to figure it out, but this is NOT an activity book for young children to do alone--an adult must help."
4,Heart Love Alive,"A collection item no doubt, as I have heard there will only be so many of these printed! It is always great to see new things from Heart...the picture on the front of the CD is worth the low price alone! Good collection of songs also."
3,Showing its age,"Hmmm. I like my Mozart a bit faster than this performance. This is a 1958 performance and seems to rather drown in the orchestral and vocal weight and Maestro Scherchen's very sluggish tempo. For example the Introitus comes in at just over 7 minutes, compared with Gardiner's 4:30 (HIP), Weill's 4:14 (HIP) or Marriner's 4:57 (Modern).It is well performed though. The ancient stereo sound has benefitted very well from the digital transfer.If you are a fan of Sherchen, this is for you, but if you are after something more sprightly and enjoyable go to one of the alternatives listed above."
2,Noisy Noisy!,"This heater heats great, but man is it loud. I wonder if I would have bought a lower wattage one if the fan would spin slower and make less noise??I'm using this in my office which is a 11x15 unit in my backyard. The wattage is totally adequate to heat the space, it's the noise that's bothersome. I typically do have music on which will help it be less noticeable, but overall I'm pretty disappointed."
5,Simple things made astonishing...,"I am a huge fan of Ms. Nye's work. I write poetry for children myself, so I am always looking for new work for kids that is unique (there seems to be an inundation, currently, in the children's market, of mediocre poetry) - I knew I couldn't go wrong with ""Come With Me"". This is what poetry is all about - taking the simple, the everyday, and turning it into something astounding! In this book, Ms. Nye makes even the smallest of journeys (a word as it travels from mouth to ear)wondrous. How different these trips will now seem to us.Each poem will leave a ""Wow..."" in your throat, and a great desire to explore your world, to discover the all the words to describe it. (And Mr. Yaccarino's ilustrations are bold, vivid - a perfect compliment.)"
2,Disappointed,"For the quality of Nye's writings this was a let down. Possibly because I'm accustomed to her poetry, I won't purchase her children's books. I still consider her an excellent poet."
5,Totally Unassuming,"Ajahn Sumedho does not try to win us over with grandiose ideas, detailed dogma, or tantalizing promises of transcendent states, but seems to emphasize being present in the moment, as simple and non-glamorous as it might be. If that sounds easy, he makes it clear how in one and the same time it is and it is not, as though we are so absorbed with all the stuff we carry inside that we miss what is really going on time and time again (no matter how well versed in the Dhamma we might be). He emphasizes his points by using himself as an example and making lighthearted fun of himself. The only promise for peace and vanquishing suffering on any level is in our starting to realize the same things about ourselves and to find the spaciousness of mind and heart that Sumedho shows to be possible. Sumedho's other books are highly recommended also."
2,Poor Design,I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it. The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off. We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat. We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine! I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head.
2,an unhappy cowgirl,unfortunately i must say that the quality of this hat was not what i expected. the material was so very very hard so it did not fit comfortably on the head. it was very stiff and ran small in size.i would not reorder this hat. i found others for less money that were a better quality.
4,Good Mystery,I liked the way Margaret Moran continues with the life of Debarah Knott and how she copes with family and being a judge.
2,M. Maron fan,"This book was not as good as all the other Margaret Maron books I have read. Very disappointed, couldn't recommend this to her readers."
3,Author writing in wrong genre.,"If you are reading this book for the mystery, Shooting At Loons starts out a little slow and I probably would have returned it to the libary unfinished if Margaret Maron's wonderful characters and descriptions hadn't kept me from putting it aside. She draws great visuals of people, personalities, and places. I never really got into the mystery, but I loved her character relationships. Every character in this book struggled with something that was important to them. If I was reviewing this book as a mainstream instead of a mystery, it would have been at least 4 stars and probably 5."
4,North Carolina resident enjoys Maron's books,"As a somewhat recent resident of Raleigh (4 1/2 years, though that almost makes me a native), and lifelong mystery lover, I truly enjoy reading Maron's books set throughout North Carolina. I stumbled upon her Deborah Knott series at the library and have devoured the entire series in less than a year. (I rarely dedicate myself to one author or one series.)But to correct Jerry Bull, this book is set on North Carolina's Crystal Coast, not the Outer Banks. It just so happens that I spent the weekend at the Crystal Coast while reading ""Loons"" and have spent some time at the Outer Banks -- they are two different areas of the coast."
5,Good Mystery,"Shooting at Loons (Deborah Knott Mysteries)I just found this series and this is the second book I have read. I have been trying to read the book in order. At first, I loved ""Bootlegger's Daughter"" but thought I would stop at that book but couldn't get Deborah out of my mind. I have continued with these wonderful books. ""Shooting at Loons"" was a good cozy book with great charactors. I can't wait to read the next books. I have ordered ""Southern Discomfort"" which was the second in this series and then hope to find the other in order of publishing date. I recommend this series highly."
3,"OK, not great","The author did a good job of setting the scene and protraying the geographic area. The characters were interesting; since I know next-to-nothing about this area, I can't say whether the characters were realistic.The mystery aspect left me pretty cold. It's hard for me to believe that a murder in such a small community didn't generate much more than casual discussions. Seems like it would have been a bigger deal. The ending/resolution was much too rushed and seemed to come out of left field.That said, I'm willing to try this author again sometime."
3,Personally liked 'Trauma' Better....,"So I stumbled upon this show as well as Trauma on Netflix. It's not a bad show, but was a bit slow at times. I was kind of hoping for more action in this show especially after watching Trauma and with it being a medical show. Favorite episode would really have to be the last episode but then I'm also mad at it since they cancelled it and now I'm left wondering WTH happened to Mike and Dr Sands!"
5,"Excellent cast, really engrossing plots","I really liked all the characters, and found myself constantly thinking about the last show and looking forward to the next one. I am shocked to find out that the show was cancelled after the first season."
3,I WATCHED IT. I LIKED IT OK. IT'S A SOAP OPERA,"It's not bad, but not especially good, either. I did not see it when it was on tv, so had no real knowledge of what to expect. I didn't keep it. I would not watch it again. Like I said, it's a soap."
1,Mercy,"This show is a total waste of time,the main actor is dreadful,and the story line very hard to believe.The ending is the best part of the movie."
1,FLOP!!!!,This show was a flop. NBC took off ER and put this Crap on.. And it is on the way out now... NBC has there head where the sun does not shine... And now they are taking off Law and Order...And you watch they will put some other flop in it place...
2,review of N/W Passage,I did not think the quality of this DVD very good and it has deterred me from purchasing any further of this program. Cheers Judy
5,Northwest Passage t.v. series Vol. One & Two,"Purchased from Amazon.com. The Northwest Passage t.v. series, Vol. One & Two were filmed in color at the MGM Studios in 1958-1959 and star Keith Larsen, Buddy Ebsen, and Don Burnett and were directed by Jacques Tourneur, Thomas Carr, George Waggner, and Alan Crossland, Jr. These volumes contain exciting adventures of frontier rangers working for the British government when America's original 13 colonies were fighting the French and the Native American Indians. These stories provide wholesome viewing for the entire family."
4,A lot better than Agatha Christie,"I got this book from the library, and even though it was translated I liked a lot. I love to read crime mysteries, but I like a better plot than the ones given by Crime-Queen Agatha Christie. I like the Maron's style, I like the duality of Deborah. It's not only action, there's a lot of charachter describing too. It has all the ingredients for a good book. I'm glad I found amazone, now I'll be able to read Maron's novels in english."
2,Boring,"Too much description, too many details, too much dialogue, too many characters, too many side stories, way too much everything. Total waste of time."
3,"it's good, but not that good","I had great expectation from this book, but it kind of let me down. The pace is rather slow."
3,"pages great, cover messy","this paperback book had a large orange sticker on the cover-- and when I removed it, the cover looked scratchy and messy. otherwise, the book was in like-new condition."
2,Only so-so,"For all the accolades, the book was merely good. It was a big disappointment, though the cover art is attractive...."
3,Solidly plotted and written with a few tics,"I read some commentary on this book in a craft book (Don't Murder Your Mystery [Agatha Award for Best Nonfiction Book]) and was eager to read a book that won four major/important awards for mystery fiction. I was not disappointed, but neither was I blown away. Overall, this is solid launch to a mystery series with an engaging protagonist. The sense of place - the South, with a capital S - is as strong as the protag's characterization. The plot and clues are thoughtfully and carefully considered - the reader will not feel betrayed by the conclusion. The minor complaints I offer (for the mass-market paperback edition) include poor copy and line editing, the introduction of so many characters that keeping track of their roles in the story becomes something of a chore, and a small handful of rather implausible situations made necessary for the plot's resolution."
4,bootleggers daughter,"This was a most enjoyable book; well written and has enough plot twists to keep you interested. I'm glad I started with this series at the beginning, since there are numerous ongoing subplots. Deborah Knott is a winner!"
4,SO GREAT BUT ENDED SO SAD!,"I truly enjoyed the book until the last two pages. I did not want to put it down when I started reading it. Deborah Knott is ans attorney running for district judge. She is asked to find out who murdered a woman eighteen years earlier. She starts asking questions and someone else is murdered, she keeps digging and there is another murder. Maron is a very good writer, she makes you feel like you are there and you can relate to the people involved. You will be very surprised who the killer is. At least I was. I gave it a four star instead of five because of the last two pages. I am so sad the book ended in this manner. I could not stand the lack of ethics. Talk about a gift. I really hate it happened this way. Can't say any more."
4,A Southern Laid Back Style with a Female Private Eye,"This is a pretty decent mystery. It has a southern laid backstyle with an intelligent female protagonist. I like the wayit dealt with gay people in small towns, politics in the south,the the interconnectedness of people tied together by family,geography and history."
4,Great southern who-done-it.,As a North Carolina native I enjoyed the spot on sense of place delivered in this page turner. Good use of humor without taking away from the intensity of the mystery. Excellent characterization as well.
2,Okay stories - needs a good editor!,"The stories in the collection were okay, but what really irked me was the complete disregard for sentence structure and commas. It was painful getting into this book because the poor grammar threw me and kept pulling me out of the story. If only LdyJessika had a good editor to fix these minor but innumerable mistakes!"
4,ghostyhead come lately,"I didn't love this album when it came out, and can't say I love it now, but I have found that the songs from this album have become some of my favorites when I see Rickie live. Little Yellow Town, Ghostyhead, Matters, Cloud of Unknowing, Road Kill - all awesome live. And Howard! What a great song in the live version! Give the album a try, it might surprise you. Then buy some of the live versions from her website and you will be amazed how beautiful these songs are when they are stripped down."
1,Smely Cat,The title track sounds exactly like Pheobes' 'Smelly Cat' song from Friends. I found the rest of the album annoying in it's dull pretentiousness.
4,LOVE TO SPARK!,"This is the exercise miracle I have been waiting for. I have started too many exercise programs in the past and always end up quitting. The primary reasons being boredom and lack of results. This ""SPARK"" is totally doable and motivational. I am a working mom with four kids and ten minute chunks of time are realistic. Bravo to Dr. Gaesser for his awesome plan and book."
5,Fabulous!,I love this book and plan to follow the program to the end! Dr. Gaesser has done it again with a great book. This book is written for ordinary people and is very easy to understand. I would reccommend The Spark to anyone who wants to change their life.
2,We could do without the language,"A good fitness plan, but the bad language by Karla Dougherty is offensive. She takes God's name in vain and puts it in print. I hate that, and I am sure God doesn't like it either."
3,This is a case where newer is not necessarily better.,"Much of the clarity and conciseness that marked the 3rd edition of this work as an excellent introduction to the study of underdevelopment has been lost in the 4th edition. I have used the 3rd edition several times in the past two years as a primary text for a college-level course dealing with Third World culture and politics. This semester, I moved perforce to the 4th edition and have noted that my students (most of whom are having their first exposure to international political economy and who are neither political science nor economics majors) are having far more difficulty in comprehending the theoretical bases for explaining underdevelopment than they have had in the past. In short, the 4th edition is a step backwards and is somewhat disappointing. In my opinion, the 4th edition of this work has replaced an excellent resource with merely a good one."
3,Good,"Had to buy this book for an Urban Education class... Though the readings were mandatory, book was interesting to read!"
2,Alright for the information...,"but it's just that. So if you're in the market for anything else, look.. well elsewhere. This book just gives a sometimes one-sided view on current politics surrounding captalism, poverty, etc. Interesting only for research purposes."
3,"Slow, rough playing & sound","Amidst all the praise here someone needs to note the Munich orchestra is not top flight and it shows -- very often. The sound is not up to the standards of the Jochum or other good sets from the period. An interesting reading, but slow. Not at all suuitable as an intro to Bruckner, this is for Bruckner enthusiasts only."
3,"Great, but doesn't last","I ordered one of these basin racks for the sink in my kitchen in the new house we built. I LOVE it, it does such a nice job of protecting the sink and my dishes. It keeps dishes in the sink up so that water can drain easily. I purposefully ordered the white vinyl one to match my white sink. I also thought the vinyl would have more cushion, and it does.However, it's several years later and it's gross. Because of the design, two wires go down into the feet and provide a little place for stuff to collect. The feet collect gunk, and I can't get them clean. There are also cuts in the vinyl that have exposed the inside metal and it appears to have a bit of rust. I soak it in a basin of bleach, and that cleans it up for a while. But it doesn't last. I'll be buying a stainless steel one next. I don't feel that I wasted my money, but I wish it would've lasted longer."
2,"Una interpretación muy ""a lo Böhm""","Realmente, la 9a sinfonía de Beethoven es una de mis obras favoritas, y con el tiempo he logrado reunir una buena selección de diversas interpretaciones. Este disco en particular me recuerda mucho la interpretación de Karl Böhm, ya que Monteux también ejecuta unos ""tempos"" extremadamente lentos en algunos pasajes, aunque la totalidad de la obra apenas alcanza los 67 minutos (comparados con los casi 80 de la versión de Böhm). A pesar de esto, me parece que este disco bien vale la pena para quien es fanático de la 9a sinfonía; pero tome en cuenta que la grabación original fue hecha en 1962, así que la calidad de audio quizá no alcance los estándares que espera."
4,A Frighteningly Realistic Book,"""Dancer in the Mirror"" is the story of two young girls: one dark, slim, and enigmatic; the other bright, pudgy, and cheerful. The book tells of the downward spiral of one of the girls and the other's race to help before it is too late. This is a very good book, but it drags in a few places. Although it was written for teens, I would recommend it to anyone, no matter what age."
2,Bad OCR,"I haven't bought the book, but from looking at the preview, the kindle version is an electronic scan run through an Optical Character Recognition program. Unfortunately, there was little, if any proof reading, and I saw numerous errors:To quote:""[Scoutmasters will remember that our policy is to get niim-hers. We don't zvant a select ""corps d'elite,"" hut we want....""This doesn't give me much hope for the remainder of the book."
3,The perfect full-orchestral does not yet exist.,"Whether it's choirs that don't know how to blend, an orchestra that doesn't know how to stay together, or any combination of choirs and instrumentalists that don't know how to play in tune, the Duruflé in its full orchestral version does not yet appear to have received the treatment it deserves. Sadly, this recording is no exception."
1,Can't believe I watched this whole thing,I'm all for food documentaries but this one is awful. This film was so slow! They could have told you everything you needed to know in 5 minutes but it took them a full length motion picture. I kept on watching hoping that it would get better at some point. Nope.I wasted 1.5 hours and $0.99. I want a refund but I have no one to blame but myself for watching anything past the 10 min mark.
2,"Wasn't horrible, but it's no Super Size Me",This documentary was some novel but not much.... It's often contrived and slow-moving. I get the subject matter is important but the piece could have been a little more entertaining.
1,Another dumb food documentary,"When will the boring food documentaries stop? I couldn't even make myself watch this. And all it's about is how corn byproducts are bad with 2 corny dudes hosting? ZZzzzzZZZZzzz... I skipped around throughout the movie, watching no more than 5 minutes total and I could already tell I could live without wasting my life on more of it. Go watch something else. I mean really... unless u intend to help change our f'd up American state of agricultural affairs... or you have to watch this for school... or you just really like corn... don't bother with this one."
4,The corn you don't see,This movie is a pretty even handed in coverage of the corn industry. Used it for a Girl Scout badge and it started some thought provoking discussion by the girls.
2,"Good Premise, but Not Impressed","While this had an entertaining premise, and a few funny scenes (make your own corn syrup, anyone?) it really wasn't impressive. There was no information covered that hasn't been better and more effectively covered by other documentaries. It didn't really go anywhere and had few active, useful conclusions or plans of action. I recommend spending your time on one of the more useful documentaries."
3,3 boxes of popcorn,"Very entertaining, however no outtakes at the end, and no sub-titles in english or spanish."
4,King Corn,Interesting and informative. Makes you wonder what we are really eating and could it be linked to cancer causes and obesity.
3,Informative documentary,"This documentary helped me understand farm subsidies and how those government policies came to be. I now see how the intentional overproduction of corn has driven down overall food prices in real dollars during the past 30 years. Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems like farm modern industrialization is so efficient that corn farming is not nearly as laborious as I imagined.Other aspects of the film such as corn fed cattle confinement and the filmmakers' journeys beyond their Iowa project were most intriguing. The ""extras"" are just throw aways, mildly entertaining (dare I say corny?) but nothing near what I've come to expect as bonus material from a good documentary these days."
4,King of All Corn Documentaries.,"The beginning was slow and a little corny. It gradually picked up and gave more interesting details. The film quality is not grainy, nice and clear. The number of corn based products was a-maiz-ing. I tip my cob hat to it!"
4,King corn,"If you want to know how corn came to dominate the food supply, then this documentary will offer a lot of answers.I saw Food Inc. and it was a good preview of that documentary."
5,"""You Are What You Eat""","Whether you're aware of it or not, if you're living in the United States in the early 21st century you are made of corn. ""King Corn"" is, at times, disturbing and charming. No matter what your politics, the impact of government subsidies on both farmers and consumers will both surprise and shock. Iowans will particularly enjoy the film, which documents small-town farmlife without ever mocking it."
2,King Corn,I found it not that interesting and was unable to hold my attention thru the movie. Unfortunately I'm unable to recommend this
4,good stuff,starts off kinda but overall great dvd good information well put together would buy again
5,Superior tomato paste,"This tomato paste has a naturally sweet, fresh flavor that I have never tasted in canned tomato paste. It makes unbelievably good sauces. I would recommend it to any cook who cares about quality and excellent taste."
5,spiritually amazing,"I am a fan of myth, I am fan of spirituality, I am a fan of anime.....all in oneIts interesting considering the writer wrote this as a true story, but with out any of that in mind its just a damn good anime over all."
3,"Not close to Resistance, but Zillion times better than Mobile Suit disaster","I just purchased this yesterday(22-Mar-07) and played it for around 5 mins to get the feel. It was alright, Much better than Mobile Suit gundam. Now that PS3 is available worldwide, Online play should not be a big deal. If you bought crappy games like Bomberman(360) or Genji or Mobile suit..., then you certainly will be happy with Armored Core. There is not much of a difference between the XBOX and the PS3 versions. I really cannot tell you which version is better because it does not matter. Even if you decide not to buy this game, you are not missing anything much. Your nerdiness will remain intact."
2,"Not horrible, but not great either","I first started playing AC back when the first came out on Playstation and feel in love with the game. I played the first three damn near every day and when AC4 was announced i felt a surge of of happiness and anticipation swell up. But when i FINALLY buy it, im slapped in the face with a confuseing Garage, a schematics system that takes a bit to figure out and numerous other aspects i didnt like. The game isnt bad, but its not something i would pay 60 bucks on, or 20 bucks for that matter. Like most of the user reviews here say, some missons can take up to 2 hours just to get past, which is a total turnoff personally. All n all, id suggest renting it first prior to buying, it may save you some money. I just hope the next one follows the previous AC installments and not AC4's layout and design."
2,Bought into the franchise...,"I pre-ordered this game because I enjoyed the AC series for the PS2 and was looking for a release with updated PS3 graphics. Should have waited for the review. The parts system is very confusing. Most missions are fairly stupid, some only lasting 30 seconds! By the time you figure out what you're supposed to do, you're dead, and then you have to wait for everything to load again. Tick-tock. I bought the game with a gift certificate, so I'm not out that much."
2,Something of a Disappointment,"While the video detail was wonderful, I prefer the game play of the original. The fact that I don't know what a part is going to cost me until I go to install it and the lack of information on missions before you take them really reduced my enjoyment of the game and left me wondering what I wanted to do."
4,Back pain therapy,"I the event of lower back pain, it is really nice to have an ice pack therapy (Doctor recommended) that is reusable. Just drop the jell packs in the freezer and in about an hour you can use it again."
1,Not conducive to an educational setting,I have taught American History for nearly 20 years and this is the first year that I am going to be stuck using this book. While it may be detailed and specific and have great information so do a multitude of other history books. I find The Story of America and the mediocre resources that accompany it to be ineffective in a high school setting.
3,"Good, but...","Ok, so as long as you don't require these tubes to be ""circular"" after inflating them, then you'll be fine. When they are filled with air, there is an obvious flaw with how they are molded, glued, whatever. It folds up in the shape of a taco shell. The hard kind of taco shells. Maybe not quite as extreme as a fully folded up hard shell taco shell, but thats the direction they try to go. Now they are still useable, but they are a bit goofy to manage and it just feels wrong to sit on a tube that is folding up and somewhat wrinkled. It just seems wrong."
3,snow tube,"Product worked fine, but it's alot smaller than I pictured. Plus I found a larger one at BJ's for a cheaper price."
3,Fair product quality for the price,"It was not what I ordered, but this came as a 'substitute"" from the merchant. Overall, not bad. For about 11+ bucks each including shipping is a good deal for the kids."
1,Not Worth the Extra Money,"I opted for this one since it was 39"" and had a reputable name. Not worth it at all! Once blown up the tube wouldn't even lay flat. Our older 39"" tube was much bigger and held my two small children, while this one holds only one. I have no idea where they are measuring but standards have definitely dwindled.Don't pay the extra money for this one!"
4,Great sled for smaller kids,"My six year old son rode this sled continuously over the holiday. I would say the sled is perfect for smaller children, say age seven or under."
4,Fantastic Fun,"This book is in the sperit of the others in this series, The feeling for the time period is fantastic. The mystory is not to deep but the action and wit is enough to keep you reading late into the night. These books are very good and fun reads."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,I have to say that this is amazing we are able to go camping now and actually take the boat. This wonderful little unit charged our two batteries within a couple of hours even with cloudy conditions. It is worth every penny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Arrived with Glass Shattered,"Although the packaging was not damaged, the glass solar panel arrived shattered. The panel is large and heavy for a 15 watt unit, and lacks the ruggedization that would make it appropriate for portable use. I have three other BatterMinder charger/maintainers, and have found them to be rugged and reliable. The solar panel component of this one is the weakness."
1,Poor packaging,"Two solar panels both damaged in shipment. Maybe it would arrive in better condition if there was more then a 1/4 of foam around it. Still waiting for my refund on the 2nd one,"
3,Great Jazz Artists: Wanted More Eastwood piano,"The jazz musicians who performed this tribute were excellent. Clint comments throughout on the artists and there are brief clips from his movies. I hoped that Clint would play at least one number, but the one piano performance he started at the end of the dvd lasted only seconds and then the credits rolled shortly after he started playing. I wish they had completed showing his performance on the piano on this dvd instead of cutting it off. My disappointment this is respect lead me to give an otherwise outstanding dvd 3 stars."
2,Works but...,"This charger works, however it is a cheesy plastic unit. Feels like it is going to fall apart each time I put the battery in it. No complaints on the fact that it dose what is says it will do. Charge my battery!"
3,The Book is good. The Building is not,"The Rem Koolhaus designed Seattle Public Library sounds good. And the pictures are beautiful. But as a user there are some major problems. An escalator that only goes up, abandoning users on the 10th floor. One can use some stairs down to the 6th floor, or merrily run around the spiral until you hit a wall on the 6th floor. Then you have to wait for an elevator to take you down to the 5th floor. Poor planning.The waterless urinals reek. The water fountains have no water pressure and are lukewarm. The walls are black and the lighting dim in the fiction area. The self-checkouts only have room to stack one book to the side, or you can use two self-checkouts to have enough space. The signs are hidden."
5,Great Knife!,"This is a high quality no frills ""working"" knife. The blade has a good shape for butchery and holds an edge well. It is easily up to the task of carving up a wild boar and glides through the tough ligature & bits. The molded handle provides a good grip and is easy to clean with no wood and no seams or decorations to harbor bacteria. I run it through the dishwasher and it does not seem to mind."
5,Great Skinning Knife,"Very sharp knife. I bought the knife for my first attempt at butchering hogs. No complaints here,the knife is worked great."
4,They're back!,"Who would've thought that Shaun and Bez would still be alive let alone recording under the Happy Mondays moniker in 2007? Yet here they are successfully getting their old groove on. This isn't going to blow anyone away but it's far from disappointing. This is good head-bobbing stuff that does the Happy Mondays name no shame. This is probably not the best place to start for a newbie (I highly recommend the Paul Oakenfold produced ""Pills 'n' Thrills 'n' Bellyaches"" which may be the best encapsulation of the circa 1990 Manchester sound). However, for the already initiated this is a fun return to good, rude health (and I do mean rude - this isn't for the prudish by any stretch). For those who know what I'm talking about, get your Bez on and dance like a grinning fool!"
2,not very good,"Although I am a huge fan of the Happy MOndays, Black Grape and Shaun Ryder in particular, this sounds like a horrible Happy MOndays cover band"
1,Magic Junk,"I was very disappointed with this film. I was thinking that if, it was Merlin's Workshop... it would have a lot more exciting things and magic to it. At best this was a poor attempt at a magical movie. The plot was thin the amount of magic was sparse and it couldn't have been worse if it was in black and white. This film belongs on the Cutting Room floor along with all the rejected movies that didn't make the cut for Twilight Zone."
4,A pleasant read,"A good light read that introduces hopefully the author to a new generation of SF readers. If you like this one then go read ""Lest the Darkness Fall"" by the same author."
4,sweet mellow country christmas,"""This wistful collection of songs eschews the slickness of most holiday albums. Producer Dave Lindsey has rounded up more than a dozen of Nashville's old elite among them, Gene Watson , Crystal Gayle, and the late Porter Wagoner- for a sentimental songfest. The album opens with Lorrie Morgan, beautifully melancholy ""Merry Christmas to Me"",but grows lighthearted with Tanya Tucker's exuberant ""Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!""- Gene StoutPS: I agree and would add two other standouts are: Porter Wagoner's ""Happy Birthday Jesus"" and Crystal Gayle's ""One Little Star""."
2,Beware!,"Caution! If you are looking for the original 1972 version of Lynn Anderson's ""Ding-A-Ling (The Christmas Bell),"" don't look here! This is a recent re-made version by the same artist. I was very disappointed."
2,"No vosotros forms, but better than nothing - maybe","I was terribly disappointed to find that the verb drills on these CDs do not include the informal 2d person plural vosotros,as used in Spain and, just as importantly, in much classic Spanish literature. I see no point in learning some forms of each tense and mood of verbs and not all of them. On the other hand, it is true that the vosotros form is almost never used in the Americas, so I suppose this is helpful material for those who want to learn Spanish only for use in, say, Mexico or Guatemala. But why do that? If you decide you want to anyway, this is pure drill material, and if you learn better by listening and speaking than by reading and speaking, this isn't a bad way to learn. Just remember you are only learning part of the language, and you'll be lost in Spain or speaking to native Spaniards."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed that there was no native speaker used on these CD's. Also, there are no sentences or phrases. Only simple verb tenses. You could achieve the same result by simply studying the verbs yourself or recording yourself! I never use these CD's - save your money."
2,BlueTooth Or Non?,"I can't figure out if its really equipped with not just for BT or no? It should come with it, but my used one only shows that it has in the hardware mangier and with driver details and all under comport, but try all day long to figure out why it's not working at all. The wifi in it is perfectly fine though."
1,Disappointed,"I loved this laptop when I first purchased it one year ago. For one year, I had no problems. Loved the speed and especially the superb screen resolution. I take lots of digital pictures, so screen quality was important to me. I also loved that there was a port for my Sony camera's memory card. Now the bad news...after one year of working beautifully, it just crashed. It was dead. The lights on the keyboard surface lit up, but other than that, nothing. No noises and a black screen. I took it into Best Buy's Geek Squad for diagnosis. They told me it's the motherboard. It could be up to $1100 to fix. That's almost as much as the cost of the computer itself. So here I am with one shiny, sleek, beautiful laptop...but I have to toss it. One thing is for certain, I will never buy another laptop without an extended warranty, no matter what brand it is."
5,Reliable and Good Looking,"I've had this laptop for over a year now and the only issue was the paint coming off the volume buttons. I've upgraded to Vista also without a problem (although I did add another gb of memory). When you first get it there's a lot of sony software to uninstall which is a pain, but it's like that with just about any computer."
2,Out of date,I was looking for something to give me a more up to date value. This was current in 2001 or 2002.
3,Jasku!,"I started my music endouvers in 1968/9 and I know Jan since early 80s while he was still giging with Esquires. Lookie Tookie is a solo kill time project and a mix of relaxing tunes, some blues and runaway atmosphear - melancholic theams. I would recomend this album if you are burned out after hard day's work, or perhaps would like to drift away from todays worries. Jan's soothing voice, smooth musical streams will refresh you for the days to come. So, put the CD in the slot, press play buton, kick back, turn off the lights and fly with Jan into the clouds."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A collection of less well known Robot stories, even the satirical Galley Slave.Asimov starts of talking about the Shelleys, of all things, to start with in his intro, to lead into talking about Capek and R.U.R. and hence to his robots.Another solid collection of stories, here.Rest of the Robots : Robot AL-76 Goes Astray - Isaac AsimovRest of the Robots : Victory Unintentional - Isaac AsimovRest of the Robots : First Law - Isaac AsimovRest of the Robots : Let's Get Together - Isaac AsimovRest of the Robots : Satisfaction Guaranteed - Isaac AsimovRest of the Robots : Risk - Isaac AsimovRest of the Robots : Lenny - Isaac AsimovRest of the Robots : Galley Slave - Isaac AsimovDisintegration confusion.3.5 out of 5Understanding Jovian psychology.3.5 out of 5Rulebreaker story.3 out of 5Robot detente.3 out of 5No robots in my house, even if cute.3.5 out of 5Robot hypertravel test experiment proves limited.3.5 out of 5Robot teaching mummy.3.5 out of 5Proofreading plus.3.5 out of 5"
4,Wild 12,This is the best wild since wild 9 it is jam packed with some great dance\techno tracks by jam pack i mean that the first disk has over 80 minutes the only reason it didnt get a perfect 5 is because of that stupid intro on Alex.K's megamix what was he thinking the rest is great.
1,Is this Nicolette ?!,"Is this the Nicolette from ""Now Is Early"" and DJ-Kicks and stuff ? I haven't heard it yet, but she surely doesn't look like her ! Anyway, I really hope it's her."
3,Killer Portland Trumpet of Portland Oregon,"Thara has dominated the Portland scene for decades and is truly a master in his field. His creativity is outstanding. The only reason I gave this a 3 stars vs. 5 stars is because of Thara's apparent lack of a good, solid agent to adequately market his true abilities. Having a CD with a portion of live partial cuts, and some studio cuts is not deserving of this individual to showcase his talent. I need to check out his later offerings. I'm hoping for something with some more time and effort that has gone into the final production."
3,The Forester Sisters Gospel Hits,Anyone who likes good old country Gospel will like this CD.Thank Goodness for Amazon you can find almost anything here!
5,THIS IS THE GREATEST CONTRY MUSIC EVER,"OH my happy childhood days. I remember when I was 6 and 7 years old my mom use to play this in her car when we use to be heading to the beach. These songs are so great that when we finally reach the beach and we are taking a bath in the sea and having fun these songs use to be ringing in my ears. Oh what happy days they were. My favorites in the days was Uncloudy day, Old time religion, Turn your radio on, Lily of the valley, and When i get to that train the station in the sky. Those songs was my favourites that right now while I am writing this tears are coming to my eyes that I miss those old days in 1989 and 1990. But ohwell I am not God to bring back those days. So if you love country music and you're thinking of a gospel country music buy this!"
5,Kelly and Jesse Rock!,"I bought this CD today and played the whole thing. It is definitely a CD for fans of pop music. Once you get past the usual Disney artist like Lindsay Lohan and Raven, and the strange songs...like a remake of Miracles Happen is some foreign language...I've found two songs worth buying the CD for...""Breakaway""- Kelly Clarkson...This really is a beautiful song. The lyrics are perfect, and the vocals are amazing. It's perfect.""Because You Live""-Jesse McCartney...Jesse is a true talent. Once people look past the false comparisons he's been given to Aaron Carter, etc., They'll see that he really has a lot of talent. 'Because You Live' is an amazing song. Sweet lyrics combined with Jesse's heart-melting voice make this song another wonderful song by this artist."
5,i love this cd,this cd is sooooooooooo good. i like most of the artits on it. kelly clarkson's song is the bomb. if you liked the movie you will like this cd a lot!
5,great hits,"I bought the cd because awesome ""Miracles Happen"" in the movie is so attractive for me... U guys who think this song is in Spanish or Japapese r really ignorance, even idiots can figure out the difference between Mandarin and Japanese or Spanish, obviously and definetly."
4,"Surprise, Surprise...","I love the movies, so I checked out what kind of soundtrack that would accompany it...and, surprisingly, it was a really good blend of light inspiring pop and soft romantic ballad, true to the sense of the movie, that Mia, has grown up a lot, but still has a little ways to go. My favorite tracks include or course the lucious-sounding ""Love Me Tender"" by Norah Jones and the Jazzy ""Love That Will Last"" by Renee Olstead who is only 14 years old with that beautifully aged voice! This is not my absolute favorite soundtrack, but the most surprising one. The music editor for the film gets high marks for matching music to film so wonderfully."
5,A True Master,"If Cartier-Bresson did not invent the art of 35mm street photography, he certainly brought it to the attention of other serious photographers and the public. Trained as a painter, his eye for composition was unerring, but it was his instinct for the defining human gesture--that he termed ""the decisive moment""--that made him one of the immortals of photographic history. As one of the founding members of Magnum, he changed the way we think of photographs and the way we see the world. This book is an introduction to his work. As such, it's all too short, but the economical format makes it possible to see a few decent examples of his work and perhaps to inspire further study. He was a true master of the art."
1,Not his best work,"I am a huge fan of Henri Cartier-Bresson, and I have always wanted to own a book of his work. I found this highly-rated book for $10 on Amazon and really thought I scored! Unfortunately, most of the photographs in this book are the junk of Henri Cartier-Bresson. There are only 1 or 2 interesting photographs. I'm very sorry I thought I was getting a bargain in this book. I should remember that you get what you pay for! :("
4,good little book,"bought a used copy of this recently hoping to inspire me in my use of my Rangefinder digital camera. The book contains some excellent pieces of HCB work, although the book seems to small to be an effective photo album to me."
2,"Nope, this just isn't right...","I know this is their first cd, but it just doesn't have the snap and fast pace like the other guttermouth cd's. The songs have no emotion, some are just plain stupid...get Live From The Pharmacy and here some of these songs played live...with true energy! They sound great on Live From The Pharmacy, but just not enough snappy juice or whatever here.......don't waste your money on this, get all their other cd's though...they kick."
4,0,"If you like the Orb's more spaced out stuff, you'll like this. It's very ambient and chill. Its great to relax to, or if you're in deep listening mode you'll appreciate the interweaving layers of complexity that ""appear"" simple. The beautiful mix of Satellite Serenade by Keiichi Suzuki is by itself enough reason to buy the CD. This is a complex and rather experimental CD however- don't expect catchy dance tunes."
3,Merely good,"Some Orb albums are great (U.F.Orb, Orbus Terrarum) and some merely good (Pomme Fritz, Cydonia). This album falls into the latter category. I had a sense of ""deja vu"" when I first listened to this album - like I'd heard it all somewhere before. Some of it I had - in its original form.This doesn't sound like a collection of remixes, though: it sounds like a proper Orb album, albeit one that sounds like it was made on auto-pilot. However, every noise Orb has ever committed to tape is worth having. Just buy the essentials first."
3,stereo,"I just bought this album, making the first of any ORB cd's that I own. I'm not even finished listening to track 2 yet but I can tell you that so far, it is definately in stereo... I'm not sure what these people are talking about unless this is a new version...I only gave it 3 stars because I haven't heard enough of it yet to make an educated decision."
1,"Wrong part ... appears satisfactory, but we didn't need it","I didn't notice anything wrong with this part and don't have anything bad to say EXCEPT THIS:When ordering the Decolav 1430 Bathroom Sink, a suggested part for the sink was this umbrella drain. THIS PART DOES NOT FIT THE 1430 AT ALL. Don't get fooled into buying this if you don't need it. Remember, when ordering sinks with standard openings, you can always get the hardware at a local store."
3,Heavy construction but leaks,"Very heavily built drain but beware if trying to use on a vessel sink with only the drain hole going through the granite -- the threaded portion is a bit bigger than most diamond hole saws that are reasonably available to home repairman. I could not use on my vessel sinks because I could not drill out a large enough hole in the granite - it was far cheaper to buy smaller diameter drain than to pay the significant cost of a much larger drill bit. I eventually was able to use the drain on another sink that was inset into the counter top.Secondly, the nut does not fit as snugly as I would have liked. It had a slow seep of water. I tightened it securely and it still leaked. I eventually took it all apart and then used plenty of silicon caulk before installing the nut and that worked."
1,slow drain,"While I love my Decolav sinks -- very easy cleanup -- I thought this drain would be fantastic. However, once installed they drain so slow it is crazy. Basically I have my beautiful sink and have taken the drain top part off and use no drain, the drain just lays in the sink. If anyone has an ideas how to improve this situation, please write a review and give advice."
3,mixed bag of music/bad packaging,I am a fan of Michelle and I own every release that I can find. I was a bit disappointed with this release; it could have been a killer record with a little trimming.The real complaint that I have is with the packaging. The rubber dots that hold the discs in place have already come off and the cover itself is very sparse.
4,Jacob Two Two...,"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly...although it is geared toward children. It adequately captures a child's thought process and thus it is interesting to watch...because through Jacob's eyes the hooded fang is scary and Jacob's sudden bravery is thus quite admirable. My favorite aspect of the film, though, was how nobody listened to Jacob, so he had to say everything twice. To me, that's quite sad...but so real in a way too."
1,Earlier Version of the Movie?,"I have not seen this film, but I have seen the original one from the '80s. It really freaked me out as a kid and now I can't find anywhere to buy it online. If anyone else remembers this movie or know where to find it please email me.Thanks"
3,Prep and Serve Cart mislabeled,"The quality of the cart is good, but the directions are weak. I had to redo a few steps in order to go back and fix the assembly. The pictures could have been clearer. The bolts need a lot of hand strength to tighten. After the roughly five hours of assembly, including having to reverse a couple of steps, the cart was complete. Unfortunately the casters don't lock in so it was hard to lift over a threshhold without the casters falling off. However, overall, the quality is pretty sturdy. A final note - the weight is listed as 29.5 pounds. No way! The weight on the box says 34 kg, net weight and 38 kg gross. This makes the weight closer to 80 pounds, not 29!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Like I said, you get what you pay for. Although these are ok for intro headphones they are not audiophile headphones. These are basic headphones. For someone who is not really interested in sound quality but just maybe watching a movie or youtube this is ok.If you want to really listen to music dont get these. On the other hand they are good entry headphones."
2,Dry Police Procedural,"I can't believe the other reviewer read the same book. There is no Florentine atmosphere whatsoever in this book and the Marshal is indistinguishable from his captain and neither has much of a sense of humor. She uses so many Britishisms that the story might as well have taken place in London. I haven't a clue how the caribinieri are organized and the author doesn't enlighten us. I keep confusing the captain with the marshal and vice versa. I usually breeze through mysteries but this one is tough slogging. I was 2/3 of the way through before I even got interested. I had hoped for a series featuring a detective the likes of Camilieri's Montalbano or Leon's Brunetti. They are smart, witty, compassionate and reflect the character and charm of their respective territories (Sicily and Venice). Very disappointed."
5,Truly Fashionable..,"This video is really cool. It goes behind-the-scenes of the marykateandashley Wal-Mart fashion line. Rockers, Gotti 13, rock the house while young female models strut their stuff wearing the newest Olsen fashions. The Olsens' WINNING LONDON male co-stars host this awesome fashion show. Also, Mary-Kate and Ashley themselves talk about their line. I recommend all Olsen fans alike to buy Fashion Forward!"
4,Long awaited 3rd album shines,"I heard ""Undertow"" on the T.V. show Roswell and loved it right away. After waiting for months for the CD to be released, I picked it up and didn't really like most of the other tracks. They sounded more pollished and commercial than the first two albums. But after waiting a couple weeks and re-listening, I liked more and more of the songs. These guys are maturing and the magic is still there. They are experimenting more. Undertow is brilliant and majestic with amazing chord structures. There is some techno-beat (Midnight Sun), Jazz (Let's Stay Inside) and pure pop here (Hideaway). The more you listen, the more this CD grows on you. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes something fresh and original. I only hope these guys are rewarded for their genious."
3,"One step forward, two back","I loved ""Apartment Life,"" Ivy's last CD, and eagerly awaited the release of the new one, ""Long Distance."" ""Long Distance"" has its moments--especially the trip-hoppy ""Undertow"", ""Worry About You"", and ""Midnight Sun,"" and the gorgeous bossa nova ""Let's Stay Inside."" But there are a bunch of boring songs on this one. Newcomers: buy ""Apartment Life"" first."
5,This is one of the best cd's I've ever listened to.,"Like a breath of fresh air, Ivy's music leaves you feeling light and energized. Being a fan of Astrud Gilberto's, I hear faint similiarities in the music's style: airy and smooth. ""Worry About You,"" ""Undertow"" and ""Edge of the Ocean"" are incredible. The music just makes you feel good! Ended up buying all her cd's, but Long Distance, in my opinion, is the absolute best. This music clears out the cobwebs.Enjoy"
5,"Their best album even without ""The Best Thing""","I first got into Ivy when a friend of mine put ""The Best Thing"" on a mixtape. I couldn't stop listening to it. That song is on ""Apartment Life,"" the album before this one. ""Long Distance"" is a consistently stronger album -- the production is glossier and the songwriting has matured without sacrificing any pop catchiness. This is probably the group's most popular album: soon after its release I kept hearing ""Edge of the Ocean"" playing in car commercials and on tv shows like ""Mysterious Ways"" and ""Roswell"" (Where the band actually appeared and performed the song). Usually, when such media saturation happens (Blur's ""Song 2"" for instance), I'll stop listening to the group for a while. But I didn't seem to mind when it happened to Ivy. Perhaps, to my ears, ""Long Distance"" is beyond corruption."
3,more subdued than apartment life,"""Long Distance"" is a bit more subdued and laid-back than ""Apartment Life."" I think it also lacks the catchiness of their last release.If you had to chose, get their last release. There are some nice tracks here, but nothing to die for. The first four tracks are probably the popiest. The fifth track is probably the worst, in my opinion, with the last track being the second worst."
5,Melodies from the ocean...,"Well,this album is like listening magical melodies from the edge of the ocean,traveling on a highway under the brightness of sun,dancing romantically with your loved one and never waking up from a dream of magical love.:)))A must buy for all ROSWELL fans!"
3,Gawd I love Durand's voice -- but something's missing,"I bought this record because I heard the band performing on Morning Becomes Eclectic - - Ms. Durand, with her French accent, sounds like the kind of girlfriend you might have if you were starring in a 1960's Roman Polanski movie -- a free spirit, a bit sad. The songs are mostly about dating and breaking up (While We're In Love or Lucy Doesn't Love You for example) and things like that, and are very melodic and very chic sounding. However, if you aren't dating anymore or pursuing multiple relationships, I'm not sure that these pleasant songs will stand up to repeated listenings. They didn't for me, nor did my 11 year old girl like the record much.So, I'm not sorry I bought it - - I think if I were 20 I would like this record a whole lot more, but I think it falls into the category of moody music for 20 somethings."
2,Just OK,"Got the CD for one song and that is really the only one I enjoy. The rest are OK, but just OK."
5,Digging Ivy's scene,"Long Distance is a gorgeous CD, combining the lightest electronica touches with nice musical arrangements and lyrics about relationships, crumbling and otherwise (""Disappointed,"" ""Lucy Doesn't Love You,"" ""While We're In Love""). Other highlights include ""Undertow"" and ""Edge of the Ocean,"" two songs that will sweep you away. Lead singer Dominique Durand has a sweet, sleek voice, and the songs are all incredibly catchy yet textured. I highly suggest checking out Ivy; I fell in love with every song on the album--it's soothing, and much more than background music.Oh, and for those of you who saw ""Shallow Hal,"" if you heard a few songs throughout the film that left you wondering ""Who *was* that?"": It was more than likely Ivy. The songs aren't on the ""Shallow Hal"" soundtrack, though, but they can be found on Long Distance."
3,Okay deal,My wife and I weren't the ones to use this product so we can't comment on its blissfulness. But it was purchased by us for use as a prize at a party thrown for my wife. The picture was a bit deceiving as it looked a lot bigger than it really was. $14.02 was the going price for this product when we bought it and that was a bit of a stretch.
1,None of the tricks or secrets worked!?!,"The 007 magazine really really stunk! Well first of all, I could not figure out how to make the tricks and ""secrets"" working. The directions are too confusing! Next (once i figured out how to work the dumb tricks) I tried one of them , and it did not work. So I tried a couple different ones and still none of them worked!!! I don't even think the magazine diserves 1 star!"
1,Save your money if you know how to play,Well it really isnt that satisfying but if you dont have the skill get it. It gives little detail in words about things mostly its pictures.So rember if you now how the skills work and you can beat it without gameshark forget the book.
4,cool little book,"for the money, this is a cool little book. great layout and design. of course this is only the tip of the iceberg and several more volumes need to follow. better yet, a whopping huge volume with a hefty price tag should be devoted to this subject matter. 50s era george shearing lps (there are a couple in here) alone could fill a chapter. i can picture such a lavish book on my coffee table. if Mr. Darling needs more examples of beautiful, sexy lp covers, i have a bunch. until that book gets made, however, this book is a treat."
3,Thin in some areas,"I really am not an album affectionado. Though the book was fine, it lacked the number of pages to warrant a good value."
2,Yawn.,"Decent presentation of so-so album covers from authors personal collection he must have found at thrift stores.Captions are pretty lame and offer no real information on the albums themselves. Went through it once than tossed it in my thrift store donation box.Save your money and purchase ""The Album Cover Album"" or something similar instead."
3,tecnomusic,"not all of us like this type of music i was exited wen i opened the cd. i wanted to hear ""La Hiedra"" just the way it was originaly recorded and is not; i wont condem the rest of the cd , there are some good stuff there but i am some kind of disapointed with the sound that i dont play it, maybe some of you like that kind of sound out there and that is fine with me ;but me i like real sound, so you people at CBS if you say ""Original Recordings'keep them Original,not every one is deaf out here."
4,Heralding a new era in POP-ROCK!!!!!,A truly amazing album.Singh is not afraid to venture into the unexplored realms of pop and does not shy away from his ethnicity just to sell records.Truly fantastic lyrics and is sure to lead the music revolution of the next millenium.
1,"A dull, boring cd","I agree with the guy who said this cd is very boring. The first two tracks are decent and nothing more but after that the cd drags with cheezy beats and dumb lyrics. I read so many reviews which raved this cd. I had to buy it to see for myself and was very disappointed. They compared this to Beck's Odelay? Yeah right! This doesn't even come close. To make a long story short, I sold this cd back to the used record store a few weeks later."
1,File under '1 Good song and some self-obsessive filler',"Brimful of Asha may be a pop classic, in both original and remixed form, but the rest of the album is poorly produced (it sounds very shoddy and underdone), the tracks are often lazy and disinteresting over-usages of technology, and it seems unsure what type of music it wants to be. I've tried, listened to it several times, but still it is an indistinct mess."
1,"When it wasn't very good, for the 7th time!","Is this what passes for good music these days? Why this band is such a success is beyond my understanding.The albums one hit, the annoying and repetative ""Brimful of Asha"", actually had to be remixed by Norman ""Fatboy Slim"" Cook to make it half listenable, and it is the only thing that got their 15 minutes (literally) of fame.The rest of the album is poverty stricken in both music and songwriting. I doubt it takes much thought to repeat the lines ""Brimful of Asha on the 45"" over and over again untill the listeners ears start to bleed. For this reason, Cornershop will most likely go down in history as a one-hit wonder band, and that's if they're lucky. It is definitely what their talent deserves."
1,An unimpressive effort given the bands obvious potential,"Unfortunately, this record does not live up to hype surrounding it. The first two tracks on the album are well written with a distinctive mellow beat. Unfortunately the rest of the album trails off to mediocrity. The final saddness is delivered by the last track, a butchered version of the Beatles' Norwegian wood."
2,One Hit Wonders,"When this record came out in 1997, it was considered one of the year`s best releases and a groundbreaking album. The hit ""Brimful of Asha"" played everywhere and Cornershop became the new flavor-of-the-month. A curious flavor that mixed pop and indian vibes, generating a mildly eccentric and somewhat refreshing sound. Well, despite a good beginning with ""Sleep on the Left Side"", an alright song, the rest of the record isn`t all that great and shows few points of interest. Most of the songs here are just repetitive, monotonous interludes that keep going on with no sense of cohesion. At times there`s a good beat or an original moment, but overall it just disappoints and doesn`t really glue. Just another example of style over substance, a hip record that hasn`t much to deliver and ends up being listenable but average background music. Asian Dub Foundation, Nitin Sawney or Talvin Singh do this type of asian underground sound better."
4,Dope,What's not to like about this album? Sleep on the Left Side is a perfect opener. Brimful of Asha might be the best cut on the album. Funky days flows. Good sh** is the good sh**. End it all with a Beatles cover. I can listen to this album over and over.
5,Simply excellent,"This album has been one of the best I've heard in the past couple of years. Very creative, and a great sound. It's made me go dig out some of their previous stuff."
4,Good CD,"I like this cd so much, but I wish it had more songs with words. It's good background music but if you really feel like singing there's only about 5 songs you can actually sing to."
1,"""7th Time"" Is Boring","The one-star review says it all. Tacky production, terrible vocals and most of all, irritating music. It just does not cut it. A waste."
1,Worst CD ever!,"I bought this cd because I liked the sound of ""Brim full of Asha"". I was extremely disappointed with Cornershop. It reminds me too much of the 60's-70's hippi music I got sick of 20 years ago. This is the worst cd I ever bought! I listened to it for 5 minutes and almost barfed. This CD should have a WARNING: This CD sux and should not be listened to! Watch out, this CD could be hazerdous to your health!"
4,An Interesting Blend of Styles,"Cornershop manages to slam together a good album from rather disparate sources - pop music (mainly), Indian instruments and themes, and electronic beats. The album starts of strong with ""Sleep on the Left Side"" and the great single ""Brimful of Asha"" (which should spark a few memories for anyone with a 7"" collection), as well as the engaging ""Butter the Soul"". Near the end of the album, it begins weighing down in programmed beats, and I found myself losing interest. The lyrics are occasionally a problem, too, as in ""It's Indian Tobacco My Friend"" (um, no it's not), and while on paper, the recording of ""Norwegian Wood"" in the Indian dialect looks promising, it simply doesn't sing very well. All in all, though, enough interesting stuff to make it worth your while."
5,Sgt. Pepper of the 90's !,"Very few albums change you.`When I was born for the 7th time' does that, and more. It stays with you, blending into your sub-conscious, enriching your mind, and allowing you to understand the world better. Song after song, this album is destined to be called as one of the great outputs of the 20th century."
1,"If you like this, Mein Kampf is up your aisle.","One of the more ridiculous books I've ever taken time to read. It began as a study; one of my students wanted to discuss what he had read in it. I obliged him by reading it, but couldn't stop watching the hypocrisy of the prologue proclaiming the NON-racism while the rest of the book tore the white race to pieces.By the time I read about the ""Mother Plane"" I felt like I was mixing Scientology with Black Supremacy. The idea that Black scientists dropped bombs from a plane forty miles up to create mountains at the time of the creation was the sort of levity I was hoping for; sadly Muhammad actually believes this."
1,VERY weak book,"This book is a poor attempt of explaining probation in America. Blah blah blah...we're all victims, give me special treatment and plenty of handouts. Don't waste any time on this book unless you have a good sense of humor and need a good laugh."
2,Asking for it,"Before AFI became A fire inside they were asking for it and the band was not too original with their hardcoreness but eventually they wrote some pop-punk songs and became real famous , this is an ok album but sounds kind of repetitive I prefer Answer that and stay fashionable but they are both pretty bland. Davey Havok had shorter hair and used to curse."
2,Not Too Proud,"This album is just a compilation of very short songs that just seem really, really stupid. I liked ""Cruise Control"" and I loved ""Crop Tub"", but apart from that it was a barren CD in my opinion. Not a sign of real quality.Another CD for the punks out there. I'm not a punk, which is why I dislike this. But punks will eat it up. Punks: Buy it. Non-Punks: Respect it if you like AFI."
4,"fast, catchy, east bay punk","The first time you hear this, you'll be completely blown away. Almost every song on this cd is extremely well written. The songs aren't at all poppy, but I wouldn't really call AFI hard-core (although they consider themselves to be)... anyway, it's certainly pretty intense. The only reason I didn't give this cd a perfect score is because it kind of loses its intensity after you've listened to it for a while (which seems to happen with most cleanly played and catchy cds.) But you should definitely buy it, because the first few hours of listening to it are unbelieveable."
5,If you like HC this one is for you,"This is one hell of a CD. If you like East coast HC this is for you. This CD is around 40 min long and it has 20 tracks, all of which are good. This CD is good to play when your going to a friends house or doing homework. sXe Forever."
4,Their best stuff,"The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because a few of the songs almost sound generic at times. But this is the style that they should have stayed with, rather than becoming the much more darker, poetic band they are today. This is perfect punk rock. Rather than being poppy and melodic like NOFX or Blink-182, which can't get you really fired up and sometimes just sounds lame, this record offers punk rock but a more raw, edgey, rough sounding punk. The lyrics are very inspired, and Davey's voice, although it might take getting used to, is really meant for punk rock. My favorite song on this record is Shatty Fatimas, because it's a hardcore type of song, and it sounds like it's trying to kick you in the head."
3,Its just OK,"AFI's new stuff is alot better. But I guess this shows their roots and where they came from. Besides the lame cover, this album is okay. But I recommend Black Sails In The Sunset over this one any day. Quite possibly their weakest effort. Still, a must own for a big fan."
2,i'm not a huge fan...,"afi has always sort of annoyed me...there is the early, straightfoward hardcore stuff like this, which is okay in moderation but obnoxious in large doses, and the extremely cheesy gothic newer material. it seems there is very little middle ground between the two, but if there was, i would probably enjoy them much more. this is fairly bland punk rock in my opinion, a couple tracks stick out, but this really isn't my thing. supposedly 'shut your mouth' mixes both of the band's sounds...i may have to check that one out."
4,"Fast, Catchy Punk Music That Is Worth Every Cent","This is AFI's second full-length album, probably their fastest one yet. The songs are all great. Davey Havok's unique voice and the catchy music from the other members seem to try and outrun each other, each trying to be the louder. You may notice that some of the songs have strange topics, but you will forget once you have been drawn and captured by the sheer speed of the music and the way it just makes you want to go do something cool... It's just indescribable. Just get the CD, it's really worth it and a good introduction to AFI for those of you who haven't got any AFI CD's."
5,A True Punk CD,"After seeing this CD get 4 reviews of only 4 stars, I had to write this. I can understand how AFI has drastically changed from ""Answer That And Stay Fashionable"" to ""The Art Of Drowning"", and how there are different fans for AFI's different CD's. If you loved ""The Art of Drowning"" or ""Black Sails in the Sunset,"" you may not like this CD, but I like all 3. This is AFI at its best punk though, and not a single bit of emo or pop in it. Davey(the lead singer)'s voice and lyrics are at its greatest here, and almost as high as Robert Plant's, though not womanly at all. The Guitar is kinda simple, but the bass and especially the drums are amazing! Get this if you're a real hardcore punk fan."
4,Every Afi fan should own this album.,This album is awesome I don't care if you're an new afi fan or an old afi fan you should have this cd.Very proud of ya is just bursting with energy which is very good if you had a bad day and you need something to forget about it just pop it in your cd player and put the volume up as much as you can and enjoy the ride. Thats what I like so much about Afi even the newer afi stuff you can listen all the way through and love every minute of it. (rock on guys)
3,OK...not the most authentic JA movie ever,"Kla$h was alright...nothing special. Jasmine Guy is worthless and her Jamaican accent is laughable. Cedella Marley has a small part as a cop...bet Bob is rolling over in his grave with his daughter portraying Babylon. The reliable Carl Bradshaw is the best thing about this movie..is there any Jamaican movie that he ISN't in?!? I was especially turned off when the movie featured Snow, the Canadian dancehall wannabe responsible for ""Informer"", instead of showcasing more of Jamaica's more talented acts."
4,with only three guns!,"I enjoyed Kla$h for it's very interesting and beautiful camera work;dark and suble,constrasted with deep, pulsating music. An action packed film which blends the beauty of Jamacia and it's dancehall music into an original view of the age old story of lust and greed. Two rekindling lovers grasping for their brass ring amind the chasos of a Jamacian concert was very unususal."
4,Kla$h,"This is the best jamaican gangstar movie to date. it features shootings, killing and bad boy style reggae. Not to mention made gurls moving their booties to the flow. A must see for any real veiwer of movies!"
3,What were they thinking ?,This is just an awful movie to watch. Jasmine Guy as a Jamaican is about as convincing as Bob Marley as Ronald Reagan.Just horrible I dont know what they were thinking.
3,Metal Shifters? curious title,"cheesy, but entertaining. enjoyed the movie overall, my wife loved it, which is odd, because she usually hates the sci-fi and horror that I love."
2,Metal Shifters,"The small town of Redeemer is in for big trouble when a Russian satellite comes crashing to Earth with a deadly bacteria on board. The space virus infects a large metal sculpture, transforming it into a giant killing machine! METAL SHIFTERS concocts one harebrained plot contrivance after another in a film that is spilling over with cheap genre cliches. The characters are expectantly bland, but none more so than the indescript action sequences, where the robotic terror does little more than sap the townspeople of their life rather than going on a destructive rampage. At most, it breaks through a couple of windows before being obliterated. The computerized effects that bring the creature to life truly aren't bad for a film of its size, and they are mostly concealed in darkness to hide any malformities. METAL SHIFTERS is just more mindless fodder for a Saturday afternoon.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
2,don't waste your money on this one.,"We sat through the movie, waiting for redemption.I did not expect much, and we did not get much,so I would say to you, ""spend your $3 on a different movie"".This is not a slam, just a reality check."
1,Dont watch this film,I was hoping for a amateur remake of transformers with a personal twist but the movie sucked.Would not suggest watching it. I just brought it because the trailer looked interesting.
1,Don't bother!!,"Sorry, Amazon, but your movie-making ability isn't as good as your movie-delivery. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and constantly wanted to just say ""to heck with it"" and turn it off. $14.99 for this? I got taken. For your own sake, don't bother purchasing this nonsensical piece of tripe."
5,fantastic book for now and tomorrow,"If you like History, are care about the future course of American foreign policy and its place in the world, this is the book for you. Wonderfully written and researched, it helps the reader understand how the views of two important presidents were shaped by events in the world and how George Bush should learn from their experiences. Those that do not study histroy are doomed to repeat it and those who care about the future direction of the country should start by reading this wonderful book."
5,Hot Buttons: How to Resolve Conflict and Cool Everyone Down,"Learning why people behave the way they do is complicated, particularly in conflict situations. Understanding why they do so is even more perplexing. HOT BUTTONS is a unique tool which takes us to that next plateau of understanding not only the 'why', but the 'how to' in dealing with the broad diversity of personal and worklife situations. It is this 'how to' that has been sorely absent. HOT BUTTONS guides us at assessing our interpersonal behaviors. It then offers, at a pace suitable to our individual life situations, a practical toolkit for both avoiding and managing potential conflict. HOT BUTTONS will be enjoyed by all...however, it is a MUST for managers of people and customer relationships."
5,Hot Stuff from Hot Buttons!,"I was pleasantly surprised by the practical advice and examples provided in Hot Buttons. Sybil Evans has taken the difficult topic of conflict resolution and masterfully crafted a text that the everyday reader (that's me) can use right away. Thank you, Sybil, for making this topic more understandable and easier to manage. I've already recommended this book to several of my co-workers!"
4,Very good Avant-Brazilian-Jazz,"This is a very good video of the Brazilian tenor saxophonist Ivo Perelman live at the Knitting Factory with a band including Geri Allen, Fred Hopkins, and Andrew Cyrille. Ivo Perelman shows his very individualistic style quite well playing over three passionate extended songs, all based, I believe, on brazilian children's songs. Geri plays very well. And vocalist Flora Purim gives a very good performance. The only downside is sometimes you tend to feel the music doesn't quite ""get there"" the band will build to a very intense groove, where you feel like they're just about to hit something incredable, and it just doesn't quite get there. Also, the video quality is not tremendously good. However, enough of the playing is good enough, and fresh enough, if you've got the bucks, it's a worthwhile investment. And if you enjoy Ivo, you'll definatly enjoy this."
1,It's Nelly...,"...and he's rapping again. That's all it is. Nelly never raps about anything of importance anyways, and when you rap about the same ol' crap all the time, you had better have the mic skills to pull it off. Unfortunately, Nelly does not. Nelly's two latest singles, ""Flap Your Wings"" and ""My Place"" are both trash songs made to be played on the radio 1,000,000 times a day, or until you get sick of them, so there's really no use for this single."
2,too much non-reggae styles mixed in.,i wasn't crazy about the lousy hip hop included along with a bit too many white arms raised as if in a heil position. i found thedvd dissapointing and realize its not my cup of meat. i am just not into non-conservative genres and some truly off key singers. i only LOVED THIRD WORLD for maybe 2 tunes. the rest just seemed boring.rap doesn't belong especially when the rap artist attempts to sing and fails miserably.
3,"Nice look, but way too tight.","I was really excited to get these and try something different. The length fit fine, but was way too tight across and right behind the ball of my foot. I've got them on boot stretchers to try and widen them out. I'd seriously reconsider buying another pair."
5,Excellent video for stretching.,"After turning 40 I am a lot stiffer and notice my body not being as flexible. This Video helps me relax and get the needed stretching that I need. Nancy's approach is very informative and easy to do,I think anyone would benefit from Powerful Stretches."
1,Sink the Minnow,"Well, Tom Carson must have had some reason for writing this mess, but I sure can't figure it out. This book is dense and pointless and probably even pretentious. I don't appreciate having my time wasted in this fashion. I wouldn't have given it any stars, but you have to give at least one..."
3,can't get enough of the rat pack,"Nashville City Paper BookClub Column - May 27, 2004If you cannot get enough of the Rat Pack then select Gilligan's Wake by Tom Carson (Picador). The writer deftly uses his background as a columnist for The Village Voice and Esquire to infuse his novel with characters famous in our pop culture.Saralee Terry Woods is President of BookMan/BookWoman Books in Nashville, and Larry D. Woods is an attorney"
2,A brilliant premise,A brilliant premise poisoned by pretentious purple prose. 1st book I bought for my Kindle Fire. VERY disappointed. I haven't read any of the author's other works so I have nothing else of his to compare this book to.
3,Action filled episode. Spock has some good lines.,"Kirk has fun breaking the prime directive and blows up the planet's computers. Spock has several good moments, including ""Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder"" Scotty does well to keep the diplomat in line."
3,Good Soundtrack Only if You Like Smashing Pumpkins,"Well, I cant really give this soundtrack much credit. I really only like two of the songs. Those two songs are the first and last ones, by the Smashing Pumpkins. All the other songs are by artists that I really don't care for, and some I've never heard of. This was a bad movie, and in my opinion, and a bad soundtrack to go with it. The only reason this soundtrack gets three stars from me is because of the Smashing Pumpkins. I love both of those songs dearly. However, if you are going to buy this album soley for the Smashing Pumpkins, pick up the remix c.d. instead. Again, this c.d. is only decent if you like the Smashing Pumpkins. Save your money."
3,"CD si not all that bad, people!","Listen the CD isn't all that bad. You have music like ""The Smashing Pumkins"" who's music fits the style of movie. As does all of The Batman movie soundtracks."
2,Huh?,"I accually liked the movie, but I just got(as a gift) the soundtrack yesterday(5/4/2000) and by just looking on the back of the CD I'm very disappointed at all of these alternitive or whatever types of bands, like The Smashing Pumpkins, which isn't music it is noise. Now I'm willing to give the Jewel song a chance even though it wasn't in the movie. And the R. Kelly song I really like but I have already taped that one off of the ending credits. The first Batman movie soundtrack was the best, why can't we go back to that music? I only want the audo tape version because it has been a tradition of mine to have the soundtrack on tape since the first Batman."
2,Two stars for two songs.,"This soundtrack is pretty bad. It really pales in comparison to the ""Batman Forver"" soundtrack. I gave this two stars solely for the two (really) good songs on it. ""The Bug"" by Soul Coughing, and ""Moaner"" by Underworld. I'm a fan of R.E.M. and Smashing Pumpkins, but I just really don't like their songs on here. The Bone Thugs-N-Harmony song is really good, but edited on this CD (blech)....So overall, if you can find it for really cheap, you might want to pick it up. But it really only has a couple good songs."
4,Batman & Robin Soundtrack,"There were songs on there that had nothing to do with the movie, but, I liked it just the same."
3,Pretty Good.,"The movie was an atrocity, and its music as well. Elliot Goldenthal's score is so campy, so un-Batman. But here we have a pretty good collection of songs, that although are not up to par with Prince's work for Batman1 are enjoyable."
3,THE END,"The End is the Beginning is the End is so good. the rest are all... meh... if you are a Smashing Pumpkins fan like myself, buy this, because those 2 songs are worth it. They pretty much sounds like Jellybelly meets Stand Inside Your Love, or something."
1,hmmmm....,The only reason to buy this cd is for the goo's Lazy Eye this songs rocks but none of the others do so i have to give this only a one... Good job GOO's for making this record worth while.
2,Bad CD,"The Batman and Robin Soundtrack is a very (very) bad CD. The only songs that are good are the two Smashing Pumpkins songs. All of the other songs suck. R. Kelly is no exception. I don't even care if he wrote the song ""Gotham City"" for this movie. It's just plain annoying. I actually sold it for some money because it was so bad. But I wish I hadn't, because I just got into liking Soul Coughing, and they had a song on the soundtrack that's supposed to be a real good song. Oh well. My point is: Don't buy this CD unless you like Jewel, Bone Thugs and Harmony, R. Kelly, Underworld, etc."
1,This is NOT the ORCHESTRAL soundtrack from the Movie.,"As an avid listener and buyer of good soundtracks of movies that I was not impressed by this CD, and is a total dissapointment to the Movie. Not just that the marketing people have this new ploy to sell UNRELATED songs about the movie; they don't make it clear to the buyer that it is a collection of second rate songs. On top of that, these are songs that have nothing to do with the movie, and they are bad ones, except for Smashing Pumpkin's cut.It seems obvious that the artists on this album was approached by the producers and made an offer to them to make a quick buck, and hope that the moive will launch this album and it artists to stardom. But it did the opposite, it gounded them to oblivioin.If you are an avid soundtrack listener and buyer follow my tip, wait till the Orchestral masterpice, of Goldenthal comes out into CD. It is worth the wait."
2,Saved by the Score,"Since this album is such an eclectic mix, I have a hard time believing that anyone could like all of the songs. Most will probably only like a few of them. For me, those songs were ""Lazy Eye"", ""Gotham City"", ""Foolish Games"".However, these songs weren't the CD's real saving grace. What I actually thought was cool was that the Batman instrumental theme was on this disc. However, after opening with some decent tunes and then hitting these bright spots, I felt that the album generally goes downhill. Maybe I just don't dig this kind of music, but I sure didn't find myself singing along, that's for sure."
3,Um . . .,"Some soundtracks work well combining several different musical styles. Charlie's Angels, for example. This one does not. They threw in Smashing Pumpkins, Bones Thugs N Harmony, Jewel, R.Kelly and Goo Goo Dolls into a blender and hoped it would work for the best. It didn't. There is a very slight chance you can actually listen to this the whole way through. The people in charge of this soundtrack were obviously trying to appeal to a mass market to attract people to the soundtrack, and hoping they would see the movie. Judging from the reaction I had and the reactions of many reviewers, this CD made people want to see the movie less. Granted, there are some definate highlights (Jewel and Goo Goo Dolls mostly) but this is an overall dissapointing CD that has been lying dormant in one of my cases for a pretty long time."
5,Batman And Robin,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.
3,"uneven, just like the movies","Each Batman movie has been uneven for me, had some things that were really innovative and some things that nmade me wanna throw my seat at the screen. The soundtrack for this one is no different. While my favorite bands Smashing Pumpkins and REM offer some good tracks, the rest are off-kilter. Yes, I am for the most part a rock and roll fan but I can appreciate R & B music too...when it's good anyway. Lauren Christy, Goo Goo Dolls, and Jewel give some decent songs. However, the rest is all garbage. R. Kelly, Bone Thug n Harmony, and all the rest have done much better material than this. Wish they could have saved one good tune for their contributions to this soundtrack."
3,That One Song!,"I haven't bought this CD nor have I heard it. Most of the music at a glance seems to suck but I have heard that one Moloko song ""Fun for Me"" and no one has commented on it. This song is da bomb and the chick who sings it is sooo kool. Y'all better open up you ears and not skip over the songs from the artists you haven't heard of."
1,Probably the worst soundtrack ever!,"Like the movie, this soundtrack album sucks! I have almost 1000 soundtrack albums in my collection, and this is the worst by a long way. Elliot Goldenthal's wonderful score is, criminally, reduced to one, far to brief track, and,to make things worse, is surrounded by the most abysmal selection of tracks I have ever heard."
3,very salty feeling,I used to use this cause some relatives are health freaksbut I think it's a pretty good alternative for real toothpaste...dunno...
2,Fragile,"I have purchased three of the tags, and within two months the plastic bar that holds the ring for the collar breaks. Not possible to repair. Disappointing, as they do allow one to locate your dog in the darkness of night. Suggestion to the manufacturer...place a metal bar between the two plastic halves."
5,very best of Miki Howard,the price was great! The item came promptly as advertised.I enjoyed the music and would recommend the seller wholeheartedly! I had forgot how great Miki Howard was and the opportunity to sample some songs that I had never heard at the sellers price made it a win win situation for me
5,CeeTee,Love it! I truly miss her and hope she comes back with some good stuff. She is really gifted and her music speaks to the pain and joy that many encounter within relationships. I love this CD!
5,BUY THIS CD,"Hi. I'm sure you have read, or will read the rest of the reviews on this page if you are reading mine now... I have to agree with all of the good points brought up by the other reviewers, but these guys are better than words can describe. I love them. I can say no more. If any of them read this, I would like to extend my gratitude for the years of friendship they have shared with me. You will rock on forever!!!P.S. Jesse - thanks for plugging my band"
3,Sounds like Maroon 5 Demos...Not the Best There is,"I'm telling you this is almost a classic if it were older...but I just liked Maroon 5 better. Don't get me wrong, they did a little better than ok job with this CD. But it just sounds like Maroon 5 demos, which is not the best.Please, go for Maroon 5 instead"
3,Not The True Maroon 5,"I must say, I am the most obsessed person in the world, literally, with Maroon 5, but Kara's Flowers is a let down. When I listened to Soap Disco, it upset me. I find this C.D. very plain and boring, and the music is like pop country. If you're looking for a real C.D., try listening to Songs About Jane, Maroon 5's best C.D. yet. Or if not, try these other popular bands:Fallout BoyBackstreet BoysSimple Plan"
1,*dont wast ur money*,"i am totally in love with the music, lyrics, and style of Maroon5. The Kara's Flowers CD is a huge disappointment. It is a horrible CD and does not resemble Maroon5 in any way. Adam's voice is kina the same, but NOTHING LIKE YOU'D EXPECT.i am soooooooooo dissapointed in this CD."
5,A Great CD for all music lovers!!!,"These guys really know how to rock!! The only way to describe them is amazing! They are a combination of pop/rock/60's/Beatlish/Weezerish. Every single track is great. The Cd is'nt like others, in that it has two or three good songs and the rest suck, THE WHOLE CD is fantastic! Buy this Cd, you might want to buy two, they'll get worn out fast from overuseage! It's worth the money!"
3,Not impressed,"I love Maroon 5 so I guess I was locking for more, it didn't live up to their new music"
5,Excellent study,This book is very helpful and an excellent study for a group. I would encourage that people don't focus on weight loss or gain though and focus on eating habits overall being godly. Great book though!
3,"Sturdy and compact, but there are much better options available","I'd give this case 2.75 stars if there was the option available. I have this case. I use it for my Canon SD800IS camera. The camera fits nice and snug in it. The case is actually slightly broader than what I would like, but still fairly compact. It is sturdy and will protect your camera if it falls from waist-height, or a bit higher. But it has a Velcro flap instead of a zip. The velcro makes it easier to open and close, but it allows dust to get in very easily. And convenience of opening/closing is les important than protection from dust for a digital camera.Try Lowepro Apex 20 AW. It's slightly more expensive, but the protection is much better. Also Apex 20 AW has better space for extra memory card and battery."
5,Lowepro Rezo 15,"This is perfect for my new Canon powershot SD 700 IS. There's a small pouch on the front where I can store extra memory cards. I wish the pouch was a little bigger to accomodate an extra battery, but then it would be compromised on size.As it is, I'm perfectly satisfied witht the strap and belt clip, and I think it looks quite cool!"
1,138 QUICK Ideas to Get More Clients,"I found this book to be very outdated. As I was reading I realized that everything I have been taught lately in seminars, business meetings, etc. had been very contradictory to this book. After checking the copyright date, I realized why I felt it was outdated, it was 1993. A lot has changed since 1993!If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't buy this one... I may have learned one or two things from it, but that's it."
3,Perhaps a Bit Too Quick?,"As every business owner knows, one of the most frustrating aspects of being self-employed is finding potential customers and convincing them to buy from you. 138 Quick Ideas is a small book full of suggestions for how to network, track down, and lure customers to your door. They are laid out in a common-sense order, with good examples and straightforward text, making the book accessible to business experts and novices alike.The only drawback to the book is that most of these ideas are by now well known, and many of them are included in the other reviews you'll see here. Plus, when the title says Quick it means just that - nearly all of these ideas occupy less than a page, so the book reads swiftly. So although I can heartily recommend you read this book, I'm not so sure the retail price is justified."
4,Sound killed it for me,"One of my first classical albums was this performance, on Melodya/Angel. The sound was terrific. I later bought this CD version -- and eventually replaced it with Ashkenazy's. The LPs were as vital and dynamic as Rozhdestvensky's conducting. For me, this pressing took much of the magic away. I note that there are numerous other pressings of Rozhdestvensky conducting the work. I wonder if any of them have better sound that this? I haven't heard anybody conduct the work as well as Rozhdestvensky (though I haven't heard Pletnev)."
2,Obscure,"I have, and recommend, ""Verbal Judo, The gentle art of persuasion"". Thus I thought ""Force Option"" would be a follow-on or possibly an enhancement of that material. Force Option is an exercise in obscurity. Worth far less than half of its price.""Persuasion"" is excellent, ""Force Option"" is the other extreme. Thompson seems to be reverting to his background in education while giving the impression that he has little law enforcement experience. I get the impression he is attempting to re-establish his credentials in use of the English language, all the while ignoring one major point he made in the first book, and I quote; ""Great, profound thinkers must communicate simply. They understand the complexities, but they must make them simple so everyone can understand.""This book fails in making it ""simple so everyone can understand"", the exact opposite of the way ""gentle art of persuasion"" explains concepts."
4,Bought this a long time ago,I bought this record after hearing about it on public radio (WNYC). I like the record. It has a nice sound.
5,I Highly Enjoy this Album,Joe Sample is one of My All-Time Favorite Piano Players his Rich Tones&His Soulful Touch add so much on these Tracks here.Covers of Stuff He has done with the Crusaders&Solo but given a fresh touch here.He is a Players Player.He is a Musician you always know when He is Playing His Part He has a Smooth Vibe.
5,Perennials For Every Purpose,"I have been gardening for over twenty years. I live in zone seven. I have found Larry Hodgson's book extremely helpful and his advice right on target. He provides plant identification (photos and written), the plant's best and worst growing conditions, and companions for each plant. He takes the guess work out of perennial gardening allowing the gardener great success. Amazon helped me find the book at a great price."
4,ss,this is one of my favorite books . it is easy to read and nd gives good info for so many flowers in the midwest. even though it is ten years old the info is still up to date. thanks ss
2,Disappointed.,"I wanted to use this book to plan some interesting stops along and off of I-40. However, there are minimal maps and unless you look up every single town in each division of Tennessee, you have no idea if they are anywhere near I-40 or not. When I have purchased from the ""Off the Beaten Path"" guides in the past, they had maps with the places discussed marked at least in some way. I frankly don't know how you would much use this book to plan a trip across Tennesee. It would only be helpful if you lived there and wanted to explore around a segment of the state."
5,"Excellent product, perfect price","Arrived yesterday, set it up in 1/2 hour and sounds terrific. Rear wireless speaker (reason for the purchase) works perfectly and sounds great and the Music Port (not a reason for the purchase) is a very clever idea and allows easy access to a fantastic speaker system for my IPod. Sure, this is not a $800-$900 system, but that's not what I needed for this TV. And the 5 disc DVD player has all the features of Panasonic's more expensive models. Overall, very happy with everything."
4,Exactly what we were looking for,"This product does exatly what we need it to do. We wanted:- a multi-DVD/CD player- to be able to play the radio- speakers behind our sitting area without having to run wires- small speakersThe sound is not as full as other systems that are larger and more expensive, but if all you want is a compact system that gives you surround capabilities (without wires), then this is perfect."
4,"Great value for product, interferes with wireless computer signal","Overall I am very pleased with the Panasonic SC-HT640W 5 DVD Home Theater System. It sounds great and is a great value for its price. It is extremely convenient NOT to have wires to the rear speaker. I do wish the rear volume was a bit louder, but again a minor problem for me.For those who have a wireless router (computer signal) you will likely get interference from the Panasonic Home Theater System. I do not have the specs on the home theater system, but it must also run on wireless Channel 6, which is the same default signal for my wireless router. If this is your problem (dropped wireless signal on computer), you will need to reconfigure your wireless router to another channel. Usually a wireless router has channels 1-11. I set mine to channel 1 and now both systems work fine."
3,"Not quite what I expected, but not bad.","This unit doesn't exactly perform to the level that I was expecting but I am content with my purchase. The sound production is clear and defined, but I wouldn't recommend it in a large area. Works great in my small townhouse living room. The wireless rear did cut out often at first due to my wireless network router, but once I changed the channel on the router the problem went away. Overall I would say its a decent setup for the price, and the two way wireless with an input on the wireless speaker is a very sweet feature!"
3,Not quite surround sound quality,"Be careful, very careful when purchasing Home theatre systems such as this.They are not as advertised in most cases. This products best feature is the wireless transciever, yet it has a few bugs, such as distance and how close speakers can be placed. Too close and you get the ""Jimmy Hendricks"" feedback effect.This products downfall is that it really isn't a SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM as they would have you beleive. It is shy 2 rear speakers, and yet the on-screen setup and the manual show a different setup...STRANGE.I though it was a shipping error, but, no...it really is missing 2 speaker connection ports for what most systems call the rear speakers.The sub woofer is great and the over all sound quality is good, minus the speaker issue.If you want a better product in ths line of pre-HDDVD players (5 up), check out Samsung's sister system.Much better and more for the money. True HOME THEATRE SURROUND SOUND!"
1,**NO - DON'T**,"The sound was never that good. But I didn't have to worry about that since 6 months later it died. Kaput. Error F65. I replaced it with a Phillips purchased on sale at BestBuy. The quality & sound is so much better! Shop around on this one, it's not worth it."
5,MUST HAVE!!!,I was flipping channels about a year ago and stop on a country music channel that was playing a video...I was hooked! Victoria Shaw may never be as popular as Shania but shes got a great voice and this CD is outstanding!
1,Best singer/songwriter is Karla Bonoff .....,"Victoria is a good songwriter. She's also a competent singer, but competence is not enough. There is just no excitement, and better singers are doing her songs justice."
3,"A wealth of info, seriously needs editing","I love and hate this book. It is packed with information, and the as I'm new to microcontroller programming, I'm learning a lot from it. Myke's knowledge of the PICMicro controllers really shines through. It covers a wide range of topics from toys, sensors, C & ASM coding. Note: You'll want to turn off compiler optimizations when stepping through code to understand it or you may become confused. The optimizer is aggresive (which is good) but it can do strange things.My only real complaint is that it is full of typos and errors both in the text and schematics. One example, the schematic for experiment #96 says 6.0V but it actually needs 4.5V.Also, I've learned that it's hard to find discrete components locally now (everything is surface-mount) so you'll probably have to order parts online through Digikey, Jameco or Mouser. Order extra PICs as you'll inevitably fry a couple.If you want to learn what microcontrollers can do, than this is the book for you."
2,Could be a lot better,"As a PIC beginner I was hoping for more than this book provides in the first few chapters.As already pointed out the title is very misleading; there certainly aren't 123 ""experiments"". Many of the 123 articles are to do with the ins and outs of programming in C.The typos and other mistakes don't help either and don't fill you with confidence when what you do doesn't reflect what the book says will happen, e.g. experiment 7, p31 where the LEDs I get aren't the same as indicated, and looking at the circuit, you'd never get the LEDs lit as indicated in the book.Sloppy."
4,Very Good.. with some problems..,"Although I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, the book is an excellent ""hardware centric"" exposure to microcontrollers. The circuit and parts explainations are fragmented, and need major editing. I look at this book as a low cost way (with the $36 PICKIT1) to have hands on exposure to both C and assembly language without having to buy additional compilers or hardware. In this book, the low end microcontroller that is used in most of the ""experiments"", gives the reader the exposure to almost every conceivable peripheral that microcontrollers can be used with. The designs are extremely clever and show how much can be done with minimal circuits and code, something that is lacking in most texts. This is not a book for novices, but more of a mid-level experimenter, or evil genius wanna-be."
2,"Good circuits, terrible explinations","This book is very difficult to follow. It isn't intended for beginners, I guess, but even novices will have trouble following the information here. The circuits and ideas are good if all you want to do is build someone else's circuits, but if your goal is learning about microcontrollers, this one is somewhat poorly written and tough to follow. Also, as other reviews have stated, expect MANY typographical errors!"
2,"Quite frustrating to learn from, missing important stuff","Myke Predko obviously knows his stuff, and can relate it pretty well to the average person. However, this book is FULL of typos. I'm talking at least every other page has one. Some of these in the actual code, making it quite a challenge, and almost impossible to debug.The CD was NOT included, nor is it on the website the book claims it should be. This is quite a hinderence. Also, Myke's website(www.myke.com) is long overdue for an update. To the point this book isn't even mentioned on it.I would be embarrassed and ashamed if my name was on the cover of this book. I can't recommend this to anyone, even ""Evil Genius"" fans."
1,Waste of Money,"There are some useful projects in this book, but it's mostly a waste of money. Many of the ""experiments"" aren't experiments at all, but just pages of information you're supposed to read. About 1/3 of the book is devoted to entry-level C programming, and has nothing to do with the PIC microcontroller. In addition to the coding errors mentioned by others, the C-language instruction is being done by someone who knows little or nothing about C programming standards and proper programming style. Even the correct examples are ""weird looking"" to an experienced C programmer.Definitely not worth the money."
2,Great project/ material poorly explained,"I have had two years of c++ programming courses and I still find Predko's explanations of the c programming language to be confusing. I would never recommend this book for a beginner.However, there are many high quality projects in this book. If you are confident with c/c++ programming and are up to the challenge of decyphering Predko's explanations, then you may like this book and will enjoy the projects."
1,flawed but a good reference if you're experienced with programming,"I bought this book at the beginning of my learning process... I had already become good with Fortran, Matlab, and was moderately experienced with C. The text contains some good programs, but does a woefully poor job of explaining the details and quirks contained therein. I didn't understand much of what Predko gave us until I had read another text on PIC programming. I'm, still mad over all the uncorrected errors the book contains: several each chapter, some glaring, others subtle. Use at your own risk."
1,HOrrible,"If you gave this book 5 stars, you obviously did not try to actually put the writ into action. There are coding and code-grammatical errors through-out his book that make it very frustrating if not impossible to use. The compiler and language use listed is out-of-date, and is impossible to use unless you've had previous coding experience. It lacks clear and concurrent BOM's , and the website listed for support apparently no longer exists.This book ,as noted earlier,by another reviewer- has references to another book, ""evil genius robotics"" - It would have been nice to know that before I bought this one - as the author decides not to recover *that* information, but defers to the other book!If you want to learn PIC / Embedded programming - avoid this- as it will leave you only more frustrated than it will be of help."
1,misleading title with lots of typos,"I made a mistake when I bought the PICKit 1 not realizing that it was an out-of-date product with not many books about how to use it.So, I bought this book knowing full well the problems with it. No other options. The Microchip documentation that came with thePICkit 1 was pretty mediocre.For me, the biggest disappointment with this book is that the author spends too much time early on in the bookon C programming and not enough time on the the actual PIC itself.For example, why is it necessary to have ANSEL = 0; and CMCON0 = 7; in the code?I want to learn about the PIC not about C programming.It is terrible that the author abandoned this book.It appears that his other books don't get that great of reviews either. Someone to be avoided."
3,book review,"For the age of the technology, the book is ok. The one thing that needs updating is the configuration words needed for the config bits. It took me a bit of research to learn where to look for the new key words for setting config bits. I would rather have more experiments with the hardware than learning the C programming."
2,EPIC FAIL!,"I had such high hopes for this, but it is a complete disappointment. Poorly written and skips over key steps. The author's website is no longer maintained so don't expect and help there, even though he constantly directs you there in the book.If after reading the reviews online you still buy this book you probably enjoy banging your head against a wall.BE WARNED!"
3,The book gives some great ideas for projects,I found this book is very informative on how to do various projects and would recomment for the advanced student.
5,Michael Peterson,I have always liked Michael Peterson. His voice is music to my ears! I had to replace this CD after it was stolen...I sure missed it!
5,Best money I've spent in a while!!!,"I purchased three CD's this time. One being of a much more popular artist,initials of TK so I didn't really think Michael Peterson's CD would ""stack up"". I was pleasantly surprised. His surpassed TK's and was less expensive. There are some great old numbers that I remember fondly and I'm loving the new songs I'm hearing for the first time. Excellent CD!!!!! Now I'm thinking I paid way to much for the other CD's."
2,print color,Another cookbook with print that one can't read. This print is in a light brown and extremely hard to read.
2,Just space...not much else,"If you are in a networked environment and need the ability to exercise some control over permissions and quotas, this is not the device for you. The embedded version of XP does not allow for quota management of any type, and permissions are limited to basic share-level rights. I've heard of some people who have loaded XP Pro on to the disk, but this will nullify any support you have from LaCie. We will be looking at the Buffalo NAS."
5,"clear, concise, perfect","This book is a solid introduction to the elements of statistics and probability. I've worked through a series of mathematical statistics and econometrics courses wishing I had just this book. It is very well written; conversational and humorous. It's organization makes perfect sense. The book starts assuming you know nothing about statistics and takes you step by step through the main ideas. The author did an especially good job of describing how all the little discrete components fit together in the ""big picture"" of inferential statistics. This book is an excellent introduction to, or an enjoyable review of statistics."
5,Great Stats Assistance,I struggled getting through a required course in Biostatistics. This book was the only way I go through that class! The author put complicated ideas into terms that I could understand. The personal stories helped ease the tension I felt trying to comprehend a difficult subject.
3,average +/- 25%,"Good book if you want to know how to plug numbers into formulas to get answers, e.g. to get a passing grade. Organized subject matter well. I was disappointed in level of understanding achieved. I found myself referring to other books and internet to get better understanding. Perhaps I expected too much from an Idiot's book on this complex subject."
5,Great Statistics Book,"Great book for learning the basics of application statistics.Book contains a lot of clear and simple examples, is well illustrated. It also contains examples based on Microsoft Excel.The book can be used for statistics courses regardless the book's title that some students can find insulting."
4,Passed CLEP Exam using only this book,"I have never taken a Statistics course before, and new little or nothing about Statistics! I read 3/4 of this book, studied the examples and worked out the problems. Two weeks after I purchased the book I took the CLEP exam for Elementary/Introductory Statistics, and passed! I highly recommend this book!"
1,Don't buy this,"This book was more about the author showcasing his sense of humor than anything else. It wasn't much help because it was too vague and didn't completely explain all the necessary concepts. It was like he left out the rest of the story... A much better (and very helpful) book was ""Statistics for the Utterly Confused:"" by Lloyd JaisinghPaperback, 2006. This one was easier to understand and more thorough."
5,Great book,"This is a great book for those who are interested in truly understanding statistics. With an easy-reading format and plenty of examples, the author walks the reader through examples. The ""Stat Facts"" boxes were especially helpful."
2,Pretty dry read,"I bought this book to refresh my college level stats knowledge. I thought the author might make better use of how stat's are used in the real world, but for the most part he has not done that. Although he offers a witty and light tone to the book he does not provide many interesting analogies or real world usage examples that could have made this book much more entertaining."
2,Uninteligible gobbledygook,Typical statistics text peppered with some cute jokes.Totally incomprehensible. Complicated Greek formulas that mean nothing to a layman.Written for PHD candidates. Not for casual users.
4,Neat Astronomy Stuff,"It is very technical, but I think for research in modern astronomy it works very well. Good book to just open to any page and get some useful facts."
4,Definitive?,"There has never been a truly definitive version of EWS, to my way of thinking. The North American theatrical ""masked"" release, while not covering much, covered the artistry of the framing, and masked Kubrick's photographer's eye. The European theatrical release had a changed version of the ""Migrations"" music, obscuring the connection between the Hindi lyrics from the Bhagavad Gita and the Latin from the Requiem that plays later in the film. And worst of all, the North Americal DVD has both alterations.Having said that, this box is a marked improvement from the previous ""quick-off"" set."
4,Not pan and scan but full frame,"To counter a comment made by a disgruntled reviewer, these ""full frame"" DVDs are NOT pan and scan. They are cropped in a ratio per Kubrick's wishes; See the many interviews with Kubrick's colleagues if you doubt it.All in all, a great set and a vast improvement over the first Kubrick DVD box released. However, I do wish more extras had been included; (the pie fight from ""Dr. Strangelove"", the original ending from ""The Shining"".)"
5,Realize that a new Kubrick boxed set is due October 2007,"On October 23, 2007 Warner Home Video will be launching a new ""Stanley Kubrick Collection"". Included are brand new versions of:2001: A Space Odyssey - Special Edition (2-disc)A Clockwork Orange: Special Edition (2-disc)Eyes Wide Shut: Special Edition (2-disc)Full Metal Jacket: Deluxe EditionThe Shining: Special Edition (2-disc)All titles have been restored and remastered and will offer both archive and new bonus features. The documentary ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life In Pictures"" will also be included in this set. Apparently missing from this set, but also being released in new versions individually on October 23, are Lolita and Barry Lyndon. Eyes Wide Shut will include both the rated and unrated versions. No new release of Dr. Strangelove is planned. The new boxed set will retail at eighty dollars. All titles contained in the boxed set will be available separately including the documentary."
2,Please be AWARE,"This collection does NOT include Killer's Kiss, The Killer, Paths of Glory or SPartacus."
1,warning - full metal jacket is not widescreen,"full metal jacket is transferred at full television frame. if you, like me, can't watch a film that has been cropped on the sides then don't buy this edition. i really can't imagine any kubrick fan who would buy a cropped dvd. obviously warners did and they now have to get rid of a few extras that will never sell as individual purchases. the other discs are various framings and they all say that it is as the director requested. this one has no such disclaimer."
1,stanley kubrick collection,"I find it to be an insult to movie watchers for even Kubrick to have some of his movies to be released in pan and scan. Pan and scan looks at only faces, not the actual scene."
1,what was he thinking?,"I love these movies, they are milestones to be sure. But I refuse to purchase these titles in pan-and-scan. ""Full screen format"" is misleading and deceptive. To me ""full screen"" is the HDTV aspect ratio that fits my television. What was Kubrick thinking when he prohibited their release in letterbox? I can only hope that whomever has the rights to these films now has the brains to rectify this, otherwise they will make no money off me!"
3,"Great, but Strangelove...","All my favorites in this dvd set now! The only flaw is there full screen, yet flawed out color wise. Restoriton, for most theres a diffrence for the shining, but 2001 was VERY bright looking. The worst disgrace of all is the ""restored"" version of Dr. Strangelove! I own 2 dvds of it one clip case in the set and the 2 disc edition. The picture is so bad it hurts, film dirt and narks throughout the film!!! Still love the set! But Strangelove is in need or restoration! But thanks Kubrick for tgese masterpieces...love this"
3,"The term ""pan and scan"" does not apply here!","After reading the umpteenth observation concerning the letterboxing, or lack of letterboxing on some of the movies included in the ""Stanley Kubrick Collection"", I am compelled to point out for the umpteenth time that the term ""pan and scan"" does not apply here! The films ""The Shining"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" were each filmed with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (actually 1.37:1) and then masked to a ratio of 1.85:1 for theatrical presentation. For these DVD's the image was simply not masked at the top and bottom. Nothing you saw in the theater is missing! Areas of the image you were never intended to see, however, are visible, which is why (for example) you can see the tips of helicopter blades at the top of the screen in the shots following the Volkswagen through the mountains at the beginning of ""The Shining"". The image from side to side is all there, nothing is missing!"
1,Thank God for the Brooklyn Public Library...,"...because I did not have to spend any money on this! I am not sure what has happened to Mr. Tyree, but this book was a MONSTER to get through! In fact, it was so bad, that I am returning it today, with more that half of the 'story' left.Peep game...leave this one alone!!"
1,BORRRRRRRRIIINNNNNGGG!!!!,"Boy! Was I disappointed!! This book deserves a negative number! How many times does the word ""Flyy Girl"" have to appear on one page? I was so innundated with the word that it gave me a migraine! I also despise when authors pump themselves up by reffering to themselves in their own book! How tacky!!! I struggled to get through this book, and NO! it was NOT an easy read! I kept picking it up and putting it down again trying to will myself to finish this tragedy! This is coming from someone who can finish a ""GOOD"" book in 5 hours. Don't get me wrong, I liked Mr. Tyree's other books but my gosh, man, u coulda done better than this! What? were the publishers hounding you to hurry up and finish a book? Does anyone want my copy? This book was all over the place.A whole lot of plugging and marketing ploys. The only thing i got from it was reminiscing about the ol' days when I grew up in Philly and how much I really miss cheesesteaks and hoagies!!"
1,Mad I brought this book,"I brought this book thinking that it was going to be as good as the first two but I was very very wrong. I'm sorry to say but this book boring. I had to force myself to read it. The only reason I read it was beacuse of a 6hr car ride and I had finished the other books I hade with me. I don't know what Omar was thinking with this one. He must be trying to get a movie deal, and then there is a web address[...]I think he was just trying to promote his clothing line and record label."
3,Not one of his best.....but not a bookend either,"Okay, now I will admit that this isn't one of the best products to come out of the Omar Tyree mainframe, but I can't say that it was particularly horrible, nor will I refer to it as boring (as others have done repeatedly) If you're looking for Tracy to regress back to her first appearance in Flyy Girl, then you're reading the wrong book. I just think that this book took a different approach which is something that I respect Omar Tyree for. If you really want something new and refreshing from him, check out the books he wrote under The Urban Griot. Those are the thought provoking books that capture us and kept us reading his material."
3,Wheres the love?,"This book wasn't all that bad. It wasn't all that good either. It was just BLAH. Omar's style is cool and unlike other reviewers, I thought it was real creative how he plugged himself and Flyy Girl in the book. It was a good read especially if you're into learning about film proposals and stuff."
2,young audition,The book was interesting but it was put together for young individuals and to help show them that if they put there minds to it they can do anything.
4,Would Make A Good Movie,I really enjoyed this book. I think it will definitely appeal to women of all ages-especially those with dreams of stardom. I would go see it if it were made into a movie.
2,It could have been better.,"I read the entire book, but at one point I was going to stop. I have read all of Omar Tyree books, but this one I will probably not read again. It could have been better. I didn't like the ending."
3,It was ok,"Omar Tyree is one of my favorite authors, but this book was not my favorite. When I read a book I usually like to read it from beginning to end. I read the whole book through because I was expecting more. I was disappointed with the ending. Also one thing, the dates for particular incidents were a little out of order, but I can understand why Tyree may have done it on purpose ; ej: Aaliyah's plane crash. Well I did like the characters, they were not too boring and seemed realistic, but I was expecting more of the book to be through Tracy's eyes not so much her young cousin, Vanessa. Anyway, I would recommend those who want to read the book, get it from your local library. Especially those who love all of the drama and overrated sex scenes, this would not be your type of book to spend money on."
1,Garbage!!!!,"This book was more than boring, it was horrible! I only read it because i didnt have anything else to read at the time. Trust me dont even bother borrowing this book, it's that bad. What is wrong with Omar, he done fell off big time!"
2,Boring,"THis book was vey boring. I'm disappointed in Omar Tyree. They are trying to make Flyy Girl into a movie, and the book never indicates whether they get that far. It's no plot, no drama, just business of making movies, and how they ""would"" go about it. Tracy sort of fades off in this book, so maybe he is trying to bring out her cousin Vanessa. I was upset that i spent my hard earned money on this.ANother thing is I read Flyy girl YEARS ago. You have to remember a lot of Flyy Girl to even try to read this book. It does bring back the old characters and shows you what they are up to now, and it uses Philly a lot. However, he should have titled this book something else. I think this was a marketing tool to get his FlyyGirl Inc products out there. I am very disappointed. There better be a much better sequel."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm on page 141 and I have to say this is one of the MOST BORING books I have ever read and I read alot! I am really upset I spent the money on this hardback! The thing that really got me was when he started to talk about himself in the book, I mean what author does that???? This book is like one big marketing ad and a boring one at that."
2,A major dissappointment,"Omar Tyree has written this book as if he is a novice. His work, in my opinion, has steadily improved until he wrote this book. This book is a major decline compared to Leslie and Just say no. I was not impressed with this book at all, for me; it was a major descent in creativity and did not invoke my interest. I read the book anticipating that it would at some point, get better but it did not. However, I believe that this book was written as an introduction of Vanessa. I am hopeful that the next book will outshine them all. Unfortunately, this book was so disappointing that Mr. Tyree may have lost some fans."
1,No More Omar Tyree For Me,"I have read a couple of Tyree's other offerings (A Do Right Man and For The Love Of Money) and tried to read Sweet St. Louis and promised myself NO MORE TYREE! However, this book was on the discount rack and I needed something to read on a trip - so I bought it. This time I mean it - NO MORE TYREE!!! This book was absolutely, downright, incredibly boring. I didn't care about the characters one bit. If you must read it, get it from the library."
1,What was that?,"This book started off with potential, unfortunately Omar Tyree must have had a date with a ""flyy girl"" and needed a quickie ending! The book left me disappointed and wondering what in the world was he thinking. It appears that Omar thought this book would be a pilot into a flyy girl movie and clothing line and showed little concern for his readers desire to read a good novel. The book started off ok however as I continued to read I became disconnected with the characters and found myself skimming pages hoping I would happen upon the point of this novel. Then there was the ending...no closure on anything. I sure hope that wasn't because there is going to be a sequel. Flyy girl is now ""Goodbye girl"". I will end this by saying, although this book left a lot to be desired and I hope Omar makes this one up to his readers, he is still a great author and will continue to receive my support (as long as I don't get another one like this)!"
2,So so,"It was okay but kind of boring. Just not what I expected to come after For The Love of Money. Too me, that was a let down after Flyy Girl. And Boss Lady was a let down as well. It didn't really hold my attention."
2,This was a waste,"I liked the first book ""Flyy Girl"" and ""For the love of money"" was ok but this one was a bore. All it was was flyy girl this flyy girl that. I really felt like I lost some brain cells reading this trash. Some people just need to understand that thier life story is just boring after a while and just doesn't need a damn prequel."
1,Can I give a half a star rating?,"OMG! THis is an insult to the origonal Flyy Girl novel. I know sequels are hard, but I guess going at it three times is damn near impossible.This book was AWWFFFFFFULLLL. Please, I urge you, do not buy this book. If you absolutely want to read it, then borrow it, or buy it from a charity store or something. Totally not worth your money.Tracy was a non-element in this book, her cosuin Vanessa, talks a little bit too much to herself, and her character is difficult to like.Omar: If you trying to do a movie for Flyy Girl, go ahead, make the damn movie, we don't want to hear about you writing about Vanessa wanting to make a movie in a 3oo plus page book. JUST DO IT!Better luck next time."
1,BORING!!!!,"Ok to be honest this book started off ok but towards the middle and the end I was completly bored out of my mind, this book had no point and absolutely no action and not enough drama. Sorry but this book was no good, thank God I borrowed it from the library,So save your money and time with this one."
1,Oh My Goodness,I am simply in love with Flyy Girl but this book has to be the worst I have ever read. I understand that sometimes book start off slow on purpose to build up to a great middle and end but this book never left the ground. I fell asleep on it wice and the only reason i even finished it is because i paid my hard earned money for it.
1,What a let down.........,It was okay but kind of boring. Just not what I expected to come after Flyy Girl. I loved Flyy Girl! It didn't hold my attention.
2,Made Myself Finish It,"I had to force myself to finish this book. I loved Flyy Girl, but I honestly believe that it did not need a sequel and definitely not a third book. The idea of the cousin narrating was irritating. Tracy keep telling her cousin and her friends to learn from her, but in actuality the girls are already more than 5 years older than Tracy was when she was acting a fool in Flyy Girl, so obviously that already have different values. She was too much into their life, and we didnt learn anything about Boss Lady's life. I didn't like it. I hope there will be no more."
1,Very Disappointing,"This book was horrible. I don't know if it was writer's block or what..but this is the first time, Omar had ever disappointed me. And to think, I bought it hard cover because I was so excited.It usually takes me 2 days to read a book (MAX). This book took a whole week and a half.Uuuughhh"
4,The Practice of Qigong: Meditation and Healing,"An excellent product for those wanting more information in Chi Qong. I have been doing the Lee Holden, Evercise to Heal Chi Qong dvd's for about a year and decided I needed to know more about Chi Qong, the history and philosophy. Ken Cohen does just that and more. A series of 6 tapes which are very inclusive and will take quite some time to go through, so I got my money's worth.My only negative complaint is that these are only to be found in tape format. I would have liked them as CD's, but a minor inconvience for the information provided.Sorry about my spelling of Chi Qong, there's quite a few accepted ways."
1,"Skip this one,","I had nothing but problems with this 360i. I own another one and it has been less trouble. I called support with a series of gripper errors (20 minute hold time). They say they are phasing these out and I should by the 2000i series, but they DOA the unit and replace it. I couldn't get it to burn more than 4 in a row. After fiddling with it for about a month, I returned it. I am going to try the Primera systems now.The first one I bought had a some problems at the beginning but after they DOA'd that one, the replacement worked fine for months. I am having some gripper arm issues now, and working with support on it. I love the units when they work, and support aways does the right thing but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who needs to make more than 30 CDs a week."
1,Poor picture selection,"I was excited to get this book after reading favorable reviews via amazon.com. However, I was disappointed once I got it in my hands. Pictures which should present an essence of a decorating book, are stuffed with cacophony of colors and styles, without any specific design in mind. From more than 400 pages of photographs only two pages are exposed in an aesthetic manner (257, 298). Majority of the book is a mish-mash of nothing and everything. After seeing poor pictures, I did not care to bother to read the text (there was no spacing between chapter title rows; letters run into each other, making it hard to read.) I would not advise buying this book and I am returning it to amazon.com. for a full refund."
5,A Great Book for beginners.,"I am remodeling my house and am looking for new ideas to decorate. I bought this book and could not put it down. It has wonderful ideas and shows you how to put it all together. It even has a quiz to help you decide what kind of ""style"" you have and has workbooks to help you visualize it and make it your own."
1,cure insomnia today...read this book,"Bottom line, this book is boring. You look at the pictures, and it appears these are pics of homes that are the 'before' a makeover is done. Yet, these 'before' pics are the ones that are supposed to be the finished, great ideas. If you're having problems sleeping at night, then I highly recommend this book. If you're looking for great ideas, then I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"Beautiful book, but not what I was looking for","The book is absolutely beautiful with great color photographs and lots of information. The only thing I would caution against is that the book is mainly focused on traditional/classic and country/cozy type styles. There are a few contemporary designs featured, but anyone who is looking to design their entire house in a contemporary/modern style (think Ikea furniture) may be disappointed."
5,The New Decorating Book,"This is one of the best decorating books I have seen yet!It is up to date, Has some terrific ideas for every room in your house and is mostly made up of pictures! I am an Interior Designer and I just love this book! I highly recommend it."
1,Dreadful...Outdated design even for 10 years ago...,The interior design featured in this book was absolutely horrid. Even though this book is almost 10 years old I find it hard to beleive that garish clashing floral prints and variations of plaid were all the rage in 1997. Judging by the quality of BHG's magazines I expected so much more. Thank goodness I got it used for $1.59...
5,Author assumes I am smart & stylish but just need some info,"I hate to sound too New Agey, but I adore this book because of the obvious generosity of spirit of the author. Unlike books that talk down to you or dictate what style you ought to have, this book is written by someone who assumes I have intelligence, that I can understand design principles once they are explained, and that I have the style to do my own thing. How refreshing! This book covers it all and it educates me so I can do what I want with my own home, which, according to the book's introduction, is the whole premise of the book. Great photos throughout. I bought the hardback edition but it's out in paperback too. Just the best!"
5,This book is the best that I have on Interior Decorating,This book is really fantastic.It satisifies almost all my interior decorating needs;but I will like to source the Better Home and Gardens floor plan and templates(page258)on amazon.com
2,ugh,"So disappointed...thought there would more fresh and new ideas...I geuss I was expecting something different. So much looked similar to what I've seen before in other decorating books...don't get me wrong, the pictures and photos were all nice...and the before and after section was helpful...BUT, most else seemed like a replay of other decorating books."
2,just ok,"Price was definately great, but book was just ok. I was disappointed because I expected more 'real living' ideas. Most of the ideas look like you would need an interior designer to help you out. I needed something slightly more practical."
4,Great book of ideas,I liked this book very much - it has tons of pictures and makes for good reading as well. A good general decorating selection.
3,New Decorating Book (BH&G Decorating),"The book wasn't what I had anticipated it would be ... too many photos of what I DON'T want for my home. Would be a great book for someone who is into contemporary styles. Too bad for me ... I have always greatly enjoyed the books put out by BH&G. I was just a little disappointed this time round. Still, when push comes to shove, I'll be purchasing many more decorating books from this company in the future. Usually it's difficult to beat BH&G! (Please note: I became bored with this book 3/4s of the way through so I didn't finish it ... maybe all the good stuff is in the last 1/4 ... I may have spoken too soon.)"
1,Traditional Decorating Book,This book is not based on NEW style. It's mostly based on country and traditional decor. Too many flowery fabrics!
5,A real bargain,"Thank you for offering this soft-cover edition of The New Decorating Book. Now I can give my daughter her own copy. (She keeps borrowing mine.) This is the best decorating book on the market, because it lets me do my own thing. The gorgeous photos cover lots of decorating styles. I like the quiz that helps you see why you decorate the way you do, because it doesn't focus on one style versus another but on what kind of person you are (formal versus casual, for example). The information (kind of a textbook on decorating) explains all the basics, such as how to arrange furniture, group collections, pick colors, work with fabrics, treat windows, and so forth. This book has everything."
3,Not Much New,I bought this for my wife. She thinks that the pictures reflect decor that is a bit dated.
4,Good reference,"I refer to this book everytime I am considering redecorating a room. There is a quiz to help identify what style you prefer. The pictures are great. I'm always referring to them for color, furniture placement and merchandising ideas. Overall a good book."
3,Suburban Dream,"I have a sick fascination for the BH&G series of decorating books. On the one hand, the BH&G look is not my style. On the other hand, there's something weirdly compelling about plate after plate that illustrates a suburban dream of comfortable home life: the big, cushy sofa; the chintzes; the wide coffee table with its stack of askew coffee table books and its vase of flowers; the iconic Flea Market Find filling a niche on the largest wall; the tasteful juxtaposition of a floral and a plaid in the same color way. These books also promise the entertaining sport of seeing how many times the same identical accessory appears in different rooms, belonging to different owners. The major downside of this book -- other than the soothing sameness of the designs -- is that coverage seems less comprehensive than in previous BH&G decorating books."
1,Boring and Unfocused,I agree with the disappointed reader from Seattle. I too found this book stuffed with mediocre out-takes from the middle-brow Better Homes and Gardens magazine. It's hard to read and a graphic mess. Those glowing reviews must all be from relatives and close friends!
2,Not much help for Triglycerides,"I felt that it was quickly written book of questions and answers that didn't go into enough depth on Triglycerides. It had all the hallmarks of ""let's get this to market"" based book."
3,Not sure....,I'm still not sure how I got this book (and the other 2-3 from this author) but it was for the most part enjoyable.It is a bit dated...such as no one having cell phones...but that doesn't deter from the story at all but does make it longer.The plot has been done (and better) but it was still enjoyable up to the last chapter...where you are left to guess what happened. Definitely not the way I like to end a book.Would I recommend this book? Only if you don't have any other books to read. I'll read the other books I have from this author but I'm not expecting much other than an okay read.
1,not what I thought,"I bought this book hoping for an advanced and detailed comparison of 2 java server architectures: XML/XSLT versus JSP.It is not a comparison, or a tutorial, or an analysis of any kind. It is simply a meandering report of the author's experimention with miscellaneous technologies. No conclusions are reached. No pitfalls are described. Topics like performance and extensibility are not even touched. XSLT is only mentioned in passing as an approach that was not followed. XML is only discussed as an application's data store; a mildly interesting exercise that most certainly would not be used on any production web site. Lastly, over one third of the book is source code print out."
4,For Serious Developers,"I've found that this book goes in a lot of depth on a host of topics. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is just starting out, because the topcs are pretty advanced, but for those who are looking a for a depth of study, this is definitely the way go to. It covers each topic in detail, with a realtive amount of background that helps cover the topic completely."
1,"Eye-catching title, unimpressive content","I bought the book over internet, returned nextday. New Riders should be careful next time to keep up credibility."
4,Good insights into marketing channels,This book is a collection of essays on channel relationships in retailing and other sectors of industry. The contents include empirical research on wholesaler/distributors' and manufacturers' perceptions on manufacturer-wholesaler relationships. The book provides a good overview of the subject of marketing channels.
5,Saoco is Sabroso!,"Excellent compilation of the best Latin jazz has to offer, featuring giants such as Tito Puente, Willie Bobo, and Machito, as well as lesser known talents like Bobby Paunetto and Silvestre Mendez. The tunes are well balanced and extremely diverse, illustrating the wide spectrum of the Latin jazz genre.There are more than a few rare gems and funky delights in this sparkling collection, so grab a copy the next time you feel like treating yourself to something special. Que viva la Musica!Bruce Porter"
2,falling apart,"I ordered 2 of these, and both were falling apart at the seams when I took them out of the packaging. I ended up putting batteries in and then wrapping tape around the handle so it would not come apart, but would not order these again. The fan itself is pretty powerful, but since you have to tape up the handle, I suspect there are better made fans out there."
2,"Its a shame, really.","I really do like the sound of the Sugababes, but I feel the album is spoiled by the fact that nearly every track has disjointed, ambiguous lyrics, which at times do not make sense. I guess its hard to expect miracles, but take this for example:""When you stare in my faceYou're messin with my brainIf you try to convince meThen you better think againIf you move to my musicThe music's got to giveIf It's too complicatedThat's the way I want to live""Tell me one thing that verse actually says? Its just a collection of statements."
3,"fast, but not good","Not one of, in fact he IS the fastest guitarist on earth. 'Tis a shame his music isn't any fun to listen to. I mean yes, he's amazing and all that, but his lightning fast licks get boring when thats about all he does. He may play faster than Malmsteen, but i can actually listen to a full Malmsteen CD. If you want to hear the fastest guitar player ever, this is your man, but but if you want to hear a good guitarist, buy a Yngwie Malmsteen CD."
2,"fastest pick, that's all",Any number of finger pickers can give you more notes per second if that's what turns you on. And as for flamenco players who combine all sorts of techniques to match speed and passion they are a mountain above this style of pick-centered guitar technique.
3,Mellower than expected,"This is the first Michael Angelo Batio album I've ever heard. I already knew he is considered the world's fastest shredder before the purchase. Some other reviews seem to treat the guy like they do George Bellas by claiming he can't write good songs and only shreds throughout. These reviewers are wrong on both accounts although I admit we may have different ideas on what exactly constitutes shredding. This album has a few relatively mellow songs that make for comfortable listening and I was surprised at how restrained Michael was with the sweep picking compared to other shredders, e.g. Joe Stump. I also enjoyed his very clean playing. I can't put my finger on it but something about Michael's playing sounds unique to me. Maybe it's the tuning and the scales he uses, particularly when sweep picking. Still, the album lacks a little punch. Maybe later albums will supply this. He's certainly got my attention. Shred on!"
5,No Dogs in heaven?,Great book!! I could not put it down. Purchased five more copies to give as future gifts.
1,Compassion elusive,"There is little compassion in this book. Granted, the author did all the things he wrote about, but I don't personally believe that calling a patient cat ""fatso"" (p. 63), calling a patient's owner ""unconcious"" (p. 57), or talking about a pet owner derogatorily (p. 48 and 49) is the way to tell animal/veterinary stories. This one is a fire starter, nothing more."
5,A Rave Review from Amy's college buddy,"I read this book by Dr. Sharp in 2 days. It was an absolute delight to hear about his adventures in Hillsboro, Ohio. I savored every morsel and detail of his stories and couldn't put the book down. My family members are currently passing the book around and we keep retelling incidences from his pages. It was full of compassion, humanity and comedy, as I would expect nothing less from the Sharp clan. Can't wait for the next one!"
5,I WANT MORE BOOKS FROM THIS GUY!,"A wonderful book...I couldn't put it down. I want more to read. I laughed, I cried, I learned a lot! I feel I know this man through this compassionate, wonderful book. I grew up in southern Ohio and found the book to be a wonderful read historically. It's a book I will read again and again. I have recommended this book to everyone owning a pet or not ever owning a pet. It's a good read for everyone. Please give me more!!!!!!"
5,No Dogs In Heaven?,"My husband and I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Sharp speak at a Lions Club meeting in December of 2012. We were getting ready to leave for Las Vegas for Christmas, after hearing him speak, I bought the book for my Kindle. It was a wonderful book of short stories. We both read some of the stories while we were traveling. It is just some light reading...which is wonderful while traveling. I would definately recommend this book."
5,THIS is hip!,"Growing up on the East coast, my only exposure to TOP was ""So Very Hard to Go"" in the mid 70s. I remember liking the tune, but was not that familiar with the group. This made me see what I was missing out on! ""Willing to Learn,"" ""What is Hip?"" (especially the AMAZING horn breakdown in the middle of that tune) and ""You're Still a Young Man."" Made me wonder how I could have been kid and a young teenager in the 70s and miss out on this? Oh well, at least I was lucky enough to stumble on to this-hopefully you will too."
4,a forgotten treasure,"This is a really worthwhile CD that should bring back lots of good memories. Tower of Power is famous for their horn section and these tracks only reinforce that reputation. With a mix of favorites and lesser known works, this collection highlights the strength and vitality of this band."
3,Tower of Power: Live they are far better,"Hallo Folks. I went to two concerts of TOP in the previous years in Holland, One time outdoor for the North Sea Jazz Fetival in The Hague and one time In Paradiso, in Amsterdam. I like TOP live far better than their album recordings. So for me the best CD is TOP live. This contains all their best hits, which are played more free, open and are recorder with much more base and a clearer sound. If you are a new fan, or a a huge fan, I would recommend the Live CD."
5,A good way to see how good TOP is,"It's a good album. The songs on this are good, but there's a lot more songs that are great that aren't included. But this CD is a good way to get a great look at TOP."
5,Tower of Power is TOPs again!,"If you're a TOP fanatic (like I am), you will absolutely LOVE this package! I was fortunate enough to see TOP live at Southpoint Resort here in Vegas last weekend. Their music (and MAGIC) is just as powerful as ever! Do yourself a favor and the next time they're in concert near you, GO SEE THEM! Seeing them in person will only heighten your enjoyment of this album...representing all of their old favorites, and a few new ones to boot!"
2,Not Bad (Not especially good either),"Althouge this compilation does seem to include quite a few good tunes, it also manages to spell out what I've suspected for years. These songs all pretty much sound the same. Luckily it's a good sound, but after an hour of the same horn riffs and ""Let's Party"" lyrics, it gets tiresome. I will point out that the price on this is a great price for a CD, and even though I only listen to a couple of tracks on here, I think it was worth it for those."
5,COOL! NEAT! # 29 SICKNESS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST!!,"I think it's the best because Cassie morphs into a Yeerk. So far, it's the best Animorphs I've read! I would love for K.A.A. ( author of Animorphs ) to make more good books like this one!"
4,"Great, one of the best but . . . .","This book is one of the best , I think. I didn't give it 4 stars 'cause I found several problems with it. It starts of great in the begining, with somthing about Jake and Cassie (i'm not saying, it would be a spoiler.) My first problem is suddenly Tobias and Rachel are so openly addmitting that they like eachother. *cough* Plot hole. Or at least openly showing the others. And they Tobias and Ax whent to the dance? Stuuuupid. Anyway, it whent along great 'till the end. At the end it's kinda #19's conflict, and the descriptions of Cassie in yeerk morph should have been more detailed. Great ending, though."
3,yawn,"get real applegate, this is getting to be the same thing again. something happens, the animorphs might die, then miraculously everything is saved. stupid book"
3,not very good,"While this book is somewhat better than the books Applegates been handing out lately, I thought it was rather weak and un-realistic, alien oddities are fine, but a 13 year old girl performing brain surgery in the middle of a barn? I laughed my head off when I read that part, delusions of grandeur? Also, is it me, or is it a team effort here? and how was it that just Cassie, only cassie, managed to not get sick? I think Applegates running out of ideas here. If you were looking for a new exciting Animorphs book, this isnt really it, I found it rather slow moving."
1,Boring and Repititive,"There were way too many holes in this book. First, if the Animorphs barely survive in the Yeerk pool with their entire fighting force how can one Animorph survive? This book quickly makes Cassie a one-girl army. The brain surgery thing was stupid. Cassie did the whole thing as if she had done brain surgery on an Andalite at least ten times. It was so silly it was laughably bad. And half the book was about the Animorphs thinking about what to do and getting sick. Also, the way Cassie got into the Yeerk Pool was unoriginal and the thought of doing what she did has been going around for months. Bottom Line: this book totally lacks action and has one average girl do two near-impossible stunts in about 3 hours with absolutely no innovative stuff put in. I used to love Animorphs but the books are no longer good. Another disasterous effort for a killer Animorph book."
4,Not bad...,"Ax gets sick with a deadly Andalite disease called the Yamphut. He will die unless his Tria gland is taken out... of his head. Meaning brain surgery.Just to complicate matters, the Yamphut is contagious, and pretty soon all the Animorphs except Cassie are sick, too.And just to make things really impossible, Visser Three finds out that Aftran has sided with the Animorphs. He wants to torture her until she reveals everything she knows - which would doom the Animorphs."
5,This is K.A. Applegates Best,I Believe that The Sickness is the best book that K.A. Applegate has ever written. It desribes more action then any other book. Cassie has to rescue Aftran by herself then do brain surgery on Ax. It is my favorite book that I have ever read and probably not ever see a book compareable with it!
1,not what expected,I ordered the green clover with gold trim ND hat and they gave me some blue clover with white and gold trim.. COMPLETELY different from the one posted above. Totally dissatisfied and pissed.
4,Pretty fun,This game is fun!! It is really confusing and takes a while to install ( about 45 minutes to an hour) but it is still really fun!!
4,Great cable and a bit pricey.,This is a great cable and works great. It's a little pricey though. I hooked up my 2 PS3 systems side by side on the same 2 TV's to see about if cable quality makes a difference. On one I had the monster cable and on the other one I had the HDMI Mediabridge Ultra Series. I couldn't see the difference between the 2. I did end up keeping the Monster Cable though since I didn't want to package it up to send it back. If you are looking at these go buy the Mediabridge Ultra Series and save some money b/c no one is going to see them. Now if you want the bragging rights and the have the money by all means you can buy the monster version. I have two home theather setups in my home. One has monster which is in the living room (was the first one I put together a couple years back) and the other one with the Mediabridge which I just got done with redoing the room with theather seating.
3,need to know,i think it was a good movie but also think that it should tell you its not in english so you know before you buy a movie i do not like having to read the whole thing as i am 62 and its hard to try to read the whole film so i think somewhere thay should let you know when a movie is not in english as this has happen a few times to me i buy the movie on line then i find out when it gets here its not in english
3,Sololow's own arrangement,"The guitar arrangement is not the same way Paul Simon played on his CD. It is per Sokolow's own arragement. If you are looking for note by note guitar arrangement as Paul Simon played, you maybe a little disappointed like me."
1,More info than the blurb,"Since most casual readers will not recognise the author of the title, it should be noted that the author of this book belongs to the Ahmadiyya (Qadiani branch) sect, which other muslims do not consider to really be a part of islam (somewhat akin to to what the Mormons or Jehovah witnesses are to christianity, or what the Nation of Islam are to true islam).Therefore i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand the quran from a mainstream islamic/Ahlus-sunnah point of view."
2,"More like soup, few lentils","I agree with other reviews that the taste is good. But the image on the package suggests mostly lentils with some sauce. It's not, it's mostly sauce with few lentils. You could fix this by adding some canned lentils, but you shouldn't have to. See my picture. It's like a broth with a tablespoon on beans."
5,Very Good!,"This tastes like classic 'restaurant' dal and has great flavor. Dal is often a little soupy and not too thick like westerners might be used to when making lentils. If you want to add dal to your meal that tastes like the old fashioned Indian restaurant dal, this is the one."
2,soupy and salty,"This is the third Tasty Bite entree I've tried and the first I've been truly disappointed in. The picture on the box is very misleading as the actual product is much soupier with much less solid substance. Also, the taste of salt completely overpowers the taste of the lentils. I like the convienence of the packages and the nutrition so I'll probably try other Tasty Bite entrees - but not this one again!"
2,Wanted to like,"I wanted to like the three flavors of these I ordered.........but, I just cannot enjoy them. They taste nothing like the fine Indian food I enjoy eating out. In fact the after taste reminds me of any food that is old. Will not order again. Two stars because they tried."
2,NOT WORTH IT,This anime i did not like it was not that fun to watch.Also references about death made me not like it.It is not that funny to me.2 stars from me.
4,A dark take on love,"no spoilers in here. But I will say the character designs are good and the story is really tragic, And watch after the credits for closure."
2,Not very good...,"Just to be frank this series was by far the worst thing I've ever bought. I had the feeling that yuri would be in here and all but this series focused so much on it, it made the rest of the anime parts really not matter at all. Plot wasn't too good, fights were mediocre even for the final battle. Thank goodness I did not buy this full price. I think I'll just sell this anime to someone who cared more for the yuri then anything else, since that's all this anime seemed to really focus on."
5,Guttermouth's Best....,"With Friendly People, only Guttermouth's second album, they have created a masterpiece. Although closely followed by Musical Monkey, this is my favorite Guttermouth album and every single song is amazing except for Bullsh*t and PC gets kind of old. As long as you have a good sense of humor and like great punk music there is no way this wont appeal to you. Guttermouth is definately a great PUNK band and if you dont like them you probably like something they make fun of. They are totally unique and dont buy into trends of other bands like bush bashing (which i agree with though) and they make fun of other sh*tty emo bands which got them kicked off of Warped. This albumn is just amazing... the best songs are End on 9, Derek, Jamie's Petting Zoo (my favorite), Disneyland, Can't We All Just Get Along..., Veggicide & A**hole. If you like the Vandals or Diesel Boy you will love this."
4,Talk About Good,"During my childhood, this was my mother's favorite cookbook - long before it was feasible to access such a wide range of recipes from the internet. She lost the cookbook (and everything else) in Hurricane Katrina, and it has been difficult to replace it. We were so happy to be able to find it on Amazon.com and give it to her for Christmas. Although she has relocated from New Orleans, the cookbook and the recipes that she used from it over the holidays, made us feel at home. The cookbook itself demonstrates authentic home cooking. Each recipe reflects the contributors' individual tastes and family traditions, and the types of cooking and ingredients provide a glimpse into a distinct culture. I find it as much fun to read the recipes and their variations as to cook them."
5,The cookbook that real Cajuns use...,"I grew up in south Louisiana and this was the cookbook found in every kitchen. It's been re-published because it sells out time and again - and for good reason. It's the Cajun Betty Crocker Cookbook - good basic recipes as well as some with a twist - but all published long before the Cajun food craze that bastardized so many of the recipes we all grew up eating. I'm considered a great cook but I still pull this cookbook first to refresh my memory and spark new ideas. My mother's also a great cook as well as a Registered Dietitian and it's her bible too...worn and tattered with the cover falling off from years of use, but still her favorite. If you have to buy one authentic Cajun cookbook, buy this one."
5,Best Cookbook Ever!,"I love this cook book, it has great recipes in it that are easy to find the ingredients for, and easy to make.I received it as a gift during my first year of marriage in 1974, am now on my second one because the first is falling apart. I give it as a wedding gift to all the newlyweds I know."
2,pretty weak,Personally I think this was not the best investment of my taichi education funds. Sitting on the grass on a sunny day at Taichi Farm this stuff is fun to watch. But for videos I find a recording of a master's form to be much more valuable to watch over and over and absorb their spirit and technique. A video that is all Dr. Yang or Master Liang or people of their calibre is a much better investment.
2,Continuing a bit on the last review...,"2 & 1/2 starsThe concept is great, the idea of making it in black and white, the realism and the balls to produce it and market it to hollywood. Maxium respect, but some of the acting in this film was totally lagged or overacted (I apply no examples, so I won't ruin the film). All through the movie I got a sense of boredom even though I felt the film was important to be seen. (I do own the DVD (which I bought used on pure curosity)). Amistad was/is hyped and was fairly done, this movie had greater intentions and had the heart but lacked the will and artistic union of the heart and the soul to create a bolder vision such as the one section in the movie (which should have been taken as a means to create the rest of the movie) the ""puppet show"" scene. Great try, COULD have been GREAT. DO SEE THIS MOVIE FOR THE CONTENT."
2,wierd,i just dont understand this movie the acting was bad the new york accents were out of place it was just all over the place not good
2,Basis calculations broken,"This software is very friendly, and very thorough. Unfortunately, it can't calculate the basis of a mutual fund. Example: fund purchased 6/1/06 for $10,000. Fund sold 9/1/06 for $11,025. Turbotax takes this information and determines a short term capital gain of $11,025. The only way to override this behavior (on a number of transactions) was to manually input the gain myself in the form fields. What a waste."
3,buggy and poor customer support,"The product basically does what it's supposed to, but it makes assumptions about things (like whether you want to make estimated payments for next year or not) and it's very difficult to change these back. You shouldn't have to fight with your software. Also, it imported charities from the previous year that I didn't donate to this year, and removing these was difficult. Finally, customer support has apparently been moved out of the country. The response I received from email was clearly from someone who didn't have native level English ability and absolutely failed to answer the actual question (gave a stock answer that was irrelevant). The automated online support also has very limited options. If TurboTax is in fact the best tax prep software out there, I may have to go back to doing it by hand next year. In short, don't bother with the program if your taxes are easy, and, from reading the other reviews, don't trust it if your taxes are complex, either."
4,Get you refund in a hurry,I am a fan of Turbo Tax. I stores all my previous tax info ie investments and tax basis information. Checks my return and more importanly get my return back in my pocket quickly
1,Lots of bugs,"I found this to be a terrible product, and would never use it again. Most of my complaints involve reporting of capital gains from stock and mutual fund sales. It had so many quirks and bugs, that it took forever, and to get it write, I simply had to override the progrmas input and manually type in the correct values, which makes it impossible to e-file."
2,More trouble than help,"We purchased this to make sure we didn't miss anything re: stock options. The program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type, though they were not entered twice. It took me quite sometime to get them deleted. It also said we had to pay estimated tax next year-which isn't true since we overpaid (as we have always done). Too many errors for a tax program!"
3,"Heads up, Premier no longer includes Schedule C","For previous years, if you had a Schedule C business then Premier was the product you wanted. Now they've split off that functionality into a more expensive product Home & Business.Also, as another reviewer stated, it's a bit twitchy and you occasionally have to try to coax it into doing what you want it to. If there were another tax preparation product for Macs, I'd probably go elsewhere."
3,Not as good as last year for international income,"This product works just great if you only have income from the US. However, I had income from outside of the US this year, and this software does not handle it well.In the section for entering non-US income it got caught in some sort of infinite loop where it cycled me through the same pages over and over. The section for entering tax paid to other countries was very confusing and the help sections were useless. I realize that most people won't have to face these sections. But if you have to, be warned.I am so uncertain that I entered things correctly that I am going to try H&R; Block's free online software to see if that works better. Yes, I am going to do my taxes TWICE. I lack that much confidence in this sofware."
3,Servicable - but still too many manual items,I use Quicken religiously and I'm disappointed TurboTax still cannot import Employee Stock Purchase Plan information. It's a pain to enter these transactions manually.
