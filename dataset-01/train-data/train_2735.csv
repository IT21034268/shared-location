4,Another great read by UK.,"Liked a great deal, however, it was a bit drawn outIt had some terrific surprises and could make your blood boil."
5,Great book for a Mommy to Be!,"This book was given to me by a good friend, after I confided to her the fears I have about becoming a first time Mommy (3 weeks to go!!) Not only did it help me out tremedously, it helped me realize that I am human. I recommend this book for any Mom, and especially for any Mom to be....it really helped put it all into perspective. Thanks, Becky!"
3,In The Middle,"WWF King of the Ring is an OK game, but lacks a couple things. GOOD = lots of wrestlers, real wwf ring, easy play control BAD = poor animation, no GBC compatability, The overall game isn't really worth it, although it can give you hours of quality fun."
4,Astounding contribution to the field of Aromatherapy,"This book is the first of its kind to exclusively profile the use of hydrosols for phytoaromatherapy.and I expect it will revolutionize aromatherapy practice. Well written and researched, this book is based on Suzanne Catty's personal research. She has tried everything in this book, often on herself, and she speaks from well informed experience! I appreciate her honesty and candor. However, since the use of hydrosols (or hydrolates) is so new, often the reader is left with many questions, no fault of Ms. Catty, to be sure. What I would have appreciated was some sort of a chart or summary at the end that easily condensed much of the information in the book. As a healthcare professional and nationally certified Aromatherapist, I highly recommend this landmark achievement."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","I bought the book based on the reviews. And while I expect that this will become a good reference for me, I wished the author had not glossed over how to make hydrosols at home. If you are looking for that information, don't buy this book. If you want something that you can use to refer to what specific hydrosols can do, than this is worth buying."
5,deep and well written,Excellent introduction to hydrosols followed up by an amazing amount of usable information. Deepening the practitioners understanding of these valuable liquids and how they can gently do their work in the world of health and healing.
4,Keeping this one for my collection of aromatherapy books.,This is a nice compliment to my collection of aromatherapy books. I plan on holding on to this one for a long time.
5,Hydrosols,A definitive book of essential oil-derived waters that is thorough and written in an interesting style that I found captivating.
2,The Next Exit,"I'm disappointed in this book. Food, Accomodations, Fuel, and everything else are jumbled together in a single listing. Exit Authority (apparently out of print) gives easy visual access to each category of roadside establishments."
2,THE NEXT EXIT,"Very poorly presented. When driving down the highway, you want to know when you will arrive at a Truck stop, Rest stop, Fuel Stop, Lodging, etc. You need to classify all the things at each Exit by category rather than just lumping them all together. The Old Exit Authority was perfect. I only wish they were still publishing as this publication is of little value."
4,Very helpful,We bought our Motor Coach in the begining of summer and I found this book at the book store. We did travel a lot and this book is very helpful. There are some exits that do not say when things are there but if you watch the Bill boards you can just fill it in your book for the next trip
3,"Great Music, Bad Endings","This is a great sampler along with VOL.2,but what happens is that so many of thesesongs flow into the next track (on theartists album/CD) that they are cut off here andend abruptly, kind of ruining the naturalgroove and flow of the music."
1,Weak,"The magnetic power is very weak, useless. I wanted to use the magnets to build hand strength with my son while having fun, not sting enough."
5,Beautiful voice and great CD,A great work of Marvin Gaye. A lot of his early work that has previously never been released. Sounds like it was recorded yesterday. Highlights Marvins beautiful voice which is one of the best ever. I highly recommend this album. Over 25 songs.
1,Using on an iMac- nothing but frustration,"This modem gave me nothing but frustration. It connects only for a couple minutes at a time, then it hangs up unexpectedly. I read that it can have some trouble because of magnetism in the computer. But I have tried everything- different usb ports, using a long usb extension cord, etc. Nothing helps.Another major annoyance for me: I keep the computer asleep whenever it's not in use. But picking up the phone (any phone in the house) wakes up the computer!I will be returning this to the store- worthless.I am using an iMac G5 w/built-in iSight.Edit (update): I returned this modem and bought the 56K V.92 Lite Extended USB Macintosh Hardware Base Modem. Amazon does not seem to carry this, but I got it onprovantage dot c o mfor $45 shipped. Works great- no disconnects and doesnt wake up the imac when I pick up the phone. Using it to type this review!"
1,Does not work with Intel based MacBook Pros,Review of Apple MAO347Z/A External V.2 Modem: I should have heeded the advice in Sigrid E. Mortensen's review. This modem does not work on an Intel based MacBook Pro. I called Amazon and they said they didn't comment on reviews. I said I was not asking them to comment on a review I was asking them about a matter of fact. The person on the phone stuck to her guns and told me nothing. It would appear that Amazon knows very little about the products it sells. It should have found out the answer to my question. Instead they sent the modem to me and now I have to send it back to them.John Durocher
1,Inferior Modem,"The Apple USB Modem is an inferior product. It will not reliably connect nor stay connected. You must derate the speed to 28K baud or lower to obtain a workable connection. In contrast, using a PC with an old serial modem on the same phone line provides consistently good connection of 44K baud or better, without connection problems.Additionally, the original modem delivered by Amazon was electronically defective. Apple did replace it with one that has not caused kernel panics, at least yet."
1,Apple MA034Z/A External V.2 USB Modem,Returned this product. Apple Mac Version 10.8 no longer support this modem. This modem might work for earlier version of Mac OS.
1,Product not supported,"This product was purchased by our IT guy to use the Fax and Scan option on the computer. Upon purchase and installation, it was discovered that the item is no longer an Apple supported product. Research before you buy to make sure the product can be used."
2,This game is boring,I have played some hunting games on the computer and they top this any day this game is just overall boring
5,Game for my kid,"He's played several of the other newer games made by cabellas, he liked this one for the many features that they took away from the newer games."
2,"Please wait , loading...","I compleatly agree with the gamer from Brick, NJ this game is canstantly LOADING... and the vehicles are a pain in the @$%$# to drive, you can't control them and they have no power for climding hills or even small rocks. This game is for those people with lots of patiance."
5,Fabulous book! Wouldn't go to Paris again without it.,"I also found this book to be fabulous. I happened upon it in the library and brought it with me to Paris last year. Now I have to have my own copy for my next trip to Paris. I'd spent quite a bit of time exploring Paris already, but with this book I discovered so much more. And remember, if you do happen to get a little lost, you're still in Paris!!!"
5,a wonderful resource,I have visited Paris often and seen all the main tourist sites. However I love the city and to wander through it. This book enhanced that experience showing me places that I would never have found by myself. I hope to use it for further visits
5,Outstanding guide!,"Having been to Paris many, many times, I pretty much know my way around. I purchased this book for my last trip, to help my friend -a first time parisian- find her way around. Surprisingly, though, it was me who ended up enjoying the book the most. Very well-thought walks, easy to spot places and landmarks but thorough and interesting enough to take you off the beaten path and show you the real Paris, the charming, lively city beyond the tourist attractions. My favourite walks are Faubourg St-Germain and St-Germain-des-Pres and the ones through the Latin Quarter."
5,Hoofing it through Paris couldn't be more fun!,"Gilles Desmons has crafted a combination Parisian history overview / scavenger hunt! We had such fun - and got such good exercise - taking many of these walks. I recommend it to everyone traveling to Paris, and wish that there were similar books for other destinations."
4,very fun,this is a very fun game to play. I have heard a lot of people say that this game is very un-real. If you ask me nobady can duplicate real hunting. The game is a real as it gets. If you want a good hunting game get this one.
4,The Best Game Ever!!!,"This is for sure THE best hunting game i`ve ever played!!!The controls are easy to remember,the game is fun and challenging,I recommend this game to everyone who likes a good hunting game!!"
1,Waiting,"I am Dylan Bernier and this ""hunting"" game is one of the worst i have ever played. The graphics are so fake, the knifes can't kill a squirl, and the deer don't act like real life dear. I recomend not to buy it."
2,I give this game a 2 ONLY because when you kill,"or get killed blood and pieces go everywhere. hunting is boring wi tha semi auto rifle why just dosnt the game let you attract all the animals near you and then pull out an ak 47 or a bazooka that would be entertainment.Kids like me these days want blood and death in video games not skill and patience,but pointless unneccesary deaths everywhere!Woulnt it be greAT if you could see a peaceful bunny rabbit grazing and the to fire a rocket launcher at it? i think so.or if a rhino is charging, you just pull ot a flamethrower or something. The point is, this game needs more death. and it should let you use overly exotic and elaborate weapons in the hunt like a WW1 chain gun. THIS GAME NEEDS MORE DEATH AND EXCITEMENT THEN IT WOULD BE A 10"
3,VERY FUN but too hard to be great.,"This game can be fun. The quick hunt is loads of fun and you can choose your difficulty level to suit you. Also you can choose any weapon, piece of gear etc. Other wise the action mode gets old fast, heck all it just animals attacking you, not even a moments rest. Now the career mode I hate. As far as I know it is impossible to save after a kill. Of cours I have given up on it. Hopefully you will find a way to save because it is very fun. I love quick hunt so thats all i play. I really would recomend this game to any hunter."
1,pipe reducer,Very disappointed. Sent me the wrong item. Wasn't worth the return hassle and will never use this site again or ace either.
2,sunsets,"It wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I was hoping for a video with a bit more movement. I purchased it for my office waiting room. It literally put patients to sleep. I went back to my fish tank video. I think it would be better in a nursing home. It's very calming and has beautiful sceenes, but just not what I was hoping for."
5,Harley Davidson Barbie Collectible Ken Doll #2,This particular Ken doll is gorgeous. It makes a fine addition to my collection. I know I will continue to enjoy it throughout the years to come.
4,An excellent source for drawing tips,"This book is an excellent resource for learning how to draw all kinds of different things that would appear in a fantasy setting. It's got fantastic tips about shading, texture, and coloring. I just wish there had been a bit more information about some basics, like proportion for people like me who haven't had any formal training in how to draw."
5,Pleasantly Pleased,"I actually purchased two CD's directly from Mr. Jarrell. One for myself and one for my mother. Both of us are ""pleasantly pleased."" We had no idea that he was an accomplished pianist, and by the complexity of the sound it is evident that he has been playing for a while. I play it at home and it is very relaxing, it sounds as if there is a piano being played inside my house. I encourage any music lover who appreciates the piano to get a copy of this debut CD because it's a winner!"
3,center of tranquility,A very peaceful piece of music that is pleasing to the ear and offers the feeling of a serene place far away from the world of chaos
5,Chopper: A History of Helicopters from WWII to the War on Terror,I'm a helicopter buff. If you like true stories this book is for you.
2,Not Impressed,"Although this book reflects considerable research there are glaring flaws in that research. It is confusing at times and poorly written, because it is full of typographical errors and conflicting and confusing data. I am intimately familiar with two of the stories related in this book and one of them is fairly accurate while the other one has many inaccuracies. I served two tours in SEA in Rescue helicopters and I know a thing or two about the subject matter. It could have been an excellent book if the author had hired a proof reader and considered finding more corroboration for some of the material. Otherwise, it is a great summary of the important role of helicopters in military aviation."
1,Would be great....if it worked.,"I bought this 3 weeks ago, and the first two and a half weeks were great. Plug-n-play, and everything worked fine. Then, rather suddenly, the USB receiver quit receiving the signal. Now, it's basically a funny-looking laser pointer. Worse, since the UPC code is away at the rebate center, the only way to return it is through manufacturer, which is impossible. They have been no help whatsoever. Not only would i not buy this, I wouldn't buy anything from the company."
5,Hulkamania History,Superstars i think is really a great game. It shows you the old wwf superstars to bring back old memories. Plus you can still get the color feature if you have game boy color. The graphics are done pretty well letting you know who you and ou're opponent are. Another great feature is that when you choose a wrestler it plays they're theme song. Even though it's old it is a great game.
4,Me and You,"Me and You is one of unfortunately only three books Margaret Diehl has written. It is an incredible depiction of a struggling woman in her twenties. The emotional depth that Diehl dives into can chill you. The story is of a young, recovering alcoholic who falls in love with a controversial man twice her age. This novel is rich with the intense dwelling of the main character's mind. The book is not necessarily a tightly wrapped-up novel, but reads well and her highly emotional content absolutely wins you over."
4,really good collection,"My Eyes adored you is my cut from him.can't take my eyes off you is still a smooth jam as well.of course ""Grease"" which the Bee Gees wrote&you get there trademark production which matches Frankie's Falsetto on point.this is a really good collection."
3,"needed with the four seasons, didn't check close enuf","The music was fine, but I really was looking for Frankie Valley and the Four Seasons. My fault as I wasn't paying enough attention to what I was ordering. If Anyone wants this copy, I'd be willing to part with it for what it cost me."
5,Close your eyes and your back in time!,"Excellent CD. You just want to sing along with every cut. You feel like you're in an audience watching him perform. If you're a true fan, you shouldn't miss this one. Especially notable is ""To Give"" (The Reason I Live). It just gives me the chills each time I listen to it."
5,Awesome Book,"I loved Devlin's A Maid for All Seasons, it kept my interest in more ways then one, I had a hard time putting the book down and read it in just a couple of days. I look forward to reading everything he writes he has become my # 1 spanking author!!Keep them coming!!!!"
4,Can't believe I've skipped this one for so long,A different record by Jah Wobble. Melodic but appropriately dubby. When I looked at the cover I somehow imagined bagpipes and weird poems (though I should have known better since it is not Irish but English music). Sounds like something I will want to get back to multiple times.
1,be afraid be very afraid,"this is not tipical wobble release. Like the ablum cover portrays its not to far of on this one. The music its self isnt the worst think ever but no tipical neo wobble release. It is filled with wobbles voice throught, and not the take me to god deep throaty mello stuff this is extreem high pitch anoying sound. Even the blackemith dub has some vocals in it listen but be carefull."
3,Okay Game,"If you love sports and bugs bunny charactors this game is definitely for you. In it you compete in different sports being different charactors from bugs bunny cartoons. I gave it three stars however for a few reasons. The first is: The graphics aren't great. Plus, no color. Another reason is that i don't enjoy sports that much. However i must say that for a sports game it is very fun and very cute. It also doesn't get boring very quickly. I would recommend it for younger kids who like sports and cartoons."
5,The coolest game,I cant belive that all the other people think that it is a ok game when it is SUPER.It is a challenging Game but also fun.It has cool sports and great gameplay it is truly the best tiny toons game ever.It has many sports to play with and famous characters.It would be cool if they keep making Tiny toons games but they dont.So in short the game ROCKS
3,Hard To Get,This game is hard to get at first and gets boring very fast. I would recomend for you to get a different game and not waste your money on this game.
2,Not as good as CD#1,"I bought this CD thinking it would have some clubbing mixes, as the original version is just awesome to listen. What a disappointment!Although the mixes arent bad in themselves, if you want club/house/trance sounding mixes, you will be deceived. If you like dub/r'n'b influenced mixes, then this is definitely for you.My favourite mix is the Epic mix i believe. The album mix is really good as well.. but you need to get the album for it :-)"
4,This is a Great Basketball Game!,"This game is great in that it is very simple and easy to control. You basically play the game of basketball with all the basic moves such as slam dunks, layups, and 3 pointers. The smooth animations and funky sounds are what make this game stand out. If you just want a simple and enjoyable basketball game for the Gameboy then get this one. If you want a more complex basketball game with much more features then you must get NBA 3 On 3 Featuring Kobe Bryant."
4,Awsome game,I really like this game.It really cool.I would advise all the people that like basketball buy this game.
5,"The ""Jangleholic"" rocks Dylan","One of the more rockin' Dylan tributes, Les Fradkin showcases his vocal & multi-instrumental skills honed as the original ""George Harrison"" in the cast of Beatlemania, a member of the psych folk-rock band The Godz, and as session player on many Top 40 hit records throughout the early 70's. The multi-layered production provides a unique perspective to these Dylan classics. Standout tracks are This Wheel's On Fire and One Of Us Must Know.The tracklist:This Wheel's On FireKnockin' On Heaven's DoorThe Times They Are-A-Changin'Like A Rolling StoneJust Like A WomanLove Minus Zero/No LimitThe Mighty Quinn (Quinn The Eskimo)Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?Absolutely Sweet MarieOne Of Us Must Know (Sooner Or Later)"
4,Quick 'n Easy,"I purchased a Kodak DC3200 a little over a month ago and have found it very useful for taking pictures of my little grandson. There is one problem however which I cannot rectify. If I am too close to the subject, the flash makes the subject appear too light. The background is fine, but the subject in the foreground is too white. The camera is set to auto-flash which should correct this problem, but it doesn't. I have to take the picture further away and crop it to get what I want. This also loses resolution. Any suggestions would be helpful."
4,Great Beginner Camera,"I bought this camera and thought it was too simple for me. The picture quality is awesome and they print great. The only down side to this camera is that pictures taken at a very close range come out over exposed because of the bright flash.I returned this camera for a Fuji Finepix model. Fuji seems to have it going on with digital cameras in my opinion. This Kodak camera is good for beginners but since I enjoy using digital cameras I needed something smaller and better.If your looking for perfect quality on every angle I would recommend a Fuji model. If this is a first buy, then this camera would suite your needs because the prints are great and the photos are of great quality. I enjoyed this camera in the short time I owned it but my demands are high for a camera to be worth while."
4,90% good and 10% ok/bad,"I just bought this camera. I love it. i have wanted a dig cam for a long time now. This camera is great. Pros: great pictures, LCD screen, Flash card compatible (for more memory), zoom, small in size, etc. Cons: no lens cover and only 2 mb memory, and flash is too bright. no lens cover is fine, you can buy one ... the memory thing is ok, cause you can just buy a memory card thing. the flash is too bright SOMETIMES and makes the person too light. You should get this camera. Most digital camera's are like $..., this is a good camera to buy. i wouldn't hesitate. i would buy it right now. its worth it, trust me."
2,An appetizer,"Initially I liked the low starting price to get into digital photography. A week later, after spending $[money] on Flash, NIMH rechargeables & charger, AC adaptor and card reader, I wanted more. So I'm spending another $[money] for a different camera, and going into it limited in that the new one must take AAs and CF to prevent the rest of my $ from being wasted.If you want a camera for anything more than letting kids play with, posting auctions, or staged group shots (2 second delay after hitting shutter button, 12 second recharge time), spend the extra or wait to get one w/ OPTICAL ZOOM."
4,A Great Value,"I purchased this camera from Dell with some Dell gift certificates that I had to use. I really didn't need this camera as I have a Kodak DC280. I thought the 3200 would be a good ""bang around"" camera. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I started taking pics with it. The quality of outdoor pictures is excellent. Indoors, the flash will drown out any image that you are too close to. Indoor lighting was sufficient with the flash turned off. I have taken approximately 75 pictures with the camera and I am still on my first set of batteries. This camera (as with all Kodak digitals) is extremely easy to use with menus that are clear and concise.My only negative comment is the absence of USB connectivity. I would suggest that anyone buying this camera also purchase a Compact flash memory card (the 2mg internal memory is not sufficient)AND a USB card reader."
5,"For me, this camera is great!","I'm not at all a ""photographer"" or a camera expert, but in my opinion this is a great little camera for its quality and price. I had priced dozens of cameras from 1-megapixel and up. What you get with the Kodak DC3200 is a camera that you can use to take your everyday photos: birthdays, vacations, kids in the yard. NO, you can't make posters out of any of the pictures you take, but have you ever?I use a 64MB Compact Flash card that I share with another device. While I've never used the entire card, Kodak stated that at high quality you can get over 200 pictures, at regular quality over 800, and at lowest quality (they don't say). You would need 34 rolls of film for 800 photos, but you can reuse the flash card.The DC3200 is not fancy, complicated or expensive. It is an easy to use, everyday digital camera."
5,"Talk about an ""over-achiever""","Bought mine before year-end, looking to replace a first generation Casio QV-10. Let me tell you: if you can get it, buy it! Sure, it feels a little cheap, but the features are great, picture quality is surprising, and the cost . . . well. Buy a 64MB CompactFlash card, USB reader, and NiMH rechargeable batteries (4-AA) and you'll be in picture taking heaven! For about $350 (with all of the named accessories), I can take over 300 ""good quality"" (compressed, JPEG) or almost 200 ""best quality"" (uncompressed JPEG) pictures which upload to my PC in SECONDS!"
4,Great for the price,"This camera takes really nice pictures and considering what we paid for it, it is wonderful. The flash distance is a little short but other than that it takes nice simple pictures. The software was easy to install and easy to use. We bought this primarily for computer imaging for a remote control robot project we are attempting but we ended up using it to take pictures of our kids too.The camera is way more than we need for the robot and the kids look great."
4,Nice Beginner Camera,"This is good entry level camera. The price you can get it for (shop around) is okay for this resolution camera. Beginners and children will particularly benefit from a camera that is inexpensive and has a LCD view screen.A few issues that should be pointed out:- It does not have a USB connection. Downloads from the camera are via serial cable.- The camera supports CF media. Buy some and a USB CF reader, it beats the serial download.- Get rechargeable batteries, all digital cameras eat batteries.- The flash is very bright on object/people close up.All in all, a good entry-level camera. Let the kids have a go with it."
1,Poor quality photos indoors and out!,This camera takes very poor quality pictures indoors and out. The indoor flash photos are bleached out and the outdoor ones are usually blurry. It takes too long to take a photo and too long to recover. The only types of pictures it is good for are those where you can pose your subjects outdoors in perfecct light. I find that the disposable cameras do much better. Kodak did not respond to my comlpaints or requests even after I completed their e-mail survey that was several pages long and took 20 minutes. They also did not respond to my e-mail. I would have given it 0 stars if that were an option.
4,This is one Awesome Camera for the Money!,"Just wanted to let everyone know, that I just bought this camera on a trip to see my parents. I own a Sony Mavica FD-93, which is a very high end model. I have found that this Kodak produces very similar results, for a 10nth of the cost. It is much easier to use, and the camera is tiny compared to most. I do agree that the fact there is no lens cover is annoying, but I purchased one for less than five bucks, so big deal. I say KUDOS to Kodak, for coming out with a simple to use, affordable digital. ONE THING ABOUT THE PRODUCT REVIEW ABOVE. There is a claim that there is NO ZOOM LENS! That is false! There is a Zoom lens, it is not perfect, but it does work!"
1,Lousy indoor shots,The CCD on this camera is too slow. We had ghost images and see thru people.I return it twice to the store. I could not belive Kodak would make such a bad product. I though I had a bad unit. But both were just as bad.
3,someone from eastern usa,I got this camera of the net about a year ago and I liked it a lot but one day I turned it off and it did not turn on again. This is why I rate this item a three.
5,Great Digit Camera for the price,"I got one of these 2 1/2 weeks ago and have to say, for the price it can't be beat. It takes awesome pictures and has many features not found on cameras in its price range. For under $200, you can't find anything better. The resolution is perfect for web or smaller printouts(5x7 or 4x6). Kodak has packed a lot of features into this camera and has kept the price down by leaving out the AC adaptor and video to TV cable. The internal memory does not hold very many high res pictures, and downloading by serial cable can be very time consuming. Getting a memory card of at least 16MB is highly recommended. Some features left out that would have nice: 1) tripod mount 2) self timer. These were left out, but not a big deal."
4,Something's missing ...,"No bells and certainly no whistles. This camera is for my son (9 yrs.), so I wanted to stay under $200. The fact is that this camera takes great pictures, but I think it stinks that Kodak won't include the lens cap and the video out cable. It cost me a whopping $20 (from Kodak) for the round piece of plastic and the cable. Other cons: no mount for a tripod, no self timer, clobbers batteries, slow serial interface. I understand that $200 is not much for a digital camera and this one takes great pictures, but the lens cap and video cable thing bugs me."
1,Item is junk,This item was purchased for our church but we had to spend more $ on a diff item because this once freezes and all features do not work. Horrible
1,Too expensive for what you have to work with.,"I purchased the Membership Plus 2007 because my new software would not download my old version. I have found this to be very difficult to work in. I have done fine with the contributions and the contribution reports, but I have found the rest of the software useless."
3,Nero's Killing Machine,"This is a bit better than the last one, but must be classes as a historical novel or historical military fiction. Amusing way to rewrite history, and put forward some interesting theories about the Roman military.Buy it on sale."
2,Don't be deceived by the Title,"If I were an English Professor Dando-Collins gets an F. Although his battle accounts are wonderfully described, the book has nothing to do with Nero. Nero's name is not even mentioned until chapter 21, four times, four more times in chapter 22, and once in chapter 24. I learned nothing about Nero. I was very disappointed and misled by the title. Perhaps this book should have been titled, The 14th regiment through a Roman history of Emporers or the destruction and rise of the 14th regiment, but Nero's name should never be labeled on this book. As the tirant he was I'm sure he would be unhappy he was not even accredited with anything but being paranoid about trying to kill his mother!"
1,"This book is a waste of time, written by an idiot","If you believe that canned enthusiasm, sucking up to clients, and other such techniques, this book is for you. The author obviously has limited business experience selling anything other than perhaps wind up clocks. I believe that this book would make an excellent ""what not to do guide."" Buyers today aren't idiots. They see right through those low-end techniques and will not part with their dollars because they think you are a nice guy (which I doubt they would think if you were using these transparent techniques)"
2,A rehash of past magazines,"If you subscribe to the magazine you will be very disappointed. Most of the projects are articles directly out of the past couple years' Winter issues. If you don't subscribe, you will enjoy the book. It's a scam for true Martha devotees."
1,Why is the cover so ugly?,ALl I have to say about this book is one thing: It's a shame an art-driven publisher like Clarkson Potter would allow an ugly cover like this to bear their logo. Obvious last-minute slap job of magazine scrap pieces. What a waste of money.
2,the steering wheel is fun.,"the v8 simulator was a gift to my 3 year old son. within the first 5 minutes, the shifter broke off. no big deal. my boy still thought he was driving. but a week later the whole steering wheel portion broke loose from the supports. the seat and supports were retired to a closet. my son now plays with the steering wheel and sound buttons occasionally. he has gotten some enjoyment out of this, but overall, the toy is not durable enough to earn even a fair rating. save your money and spend it on a quality toy. for as much as this toy costs, you can buy several nice toys."
3,Broke on first try!,The gear shift on this item broke as soon as it was used for the first time on Christmas morning!
4,A lot of fun... but not durable,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. He loved to sit in the seat and 'drive' his car. However, this toy lacks durability. From the start, the brake pedal did not function (no sound effects) and he was able to remove the gear shift. After 2 months, the steering wheel snapped off. I am disappointed with the quality of this toy."
2,broke on second try,my three year old (I admit tough) nephew broke the wheel console after just the third use. A wire came loose and the street didn't move. Does not seem quite as durable as other toddler toys. Although my 6 year old nephew enjoyed it as well.
5,"Lots of Fun, but not durable",My son received this at 18 months of age. Within 3 months the stearing wheel had broken off of the side bars holding it. It is not repairable. The frustrating part is that I have been trying to contact the manufacturer for quite some time now and they have not responded at all. My nephew received the same exact toy at age 2 and the same thing happen to his. It is a shame because it is a really fun toy.
4,if it only had wheels!!,"I bought this car for my three year old son for Christmas and he LOVES it!! He plays with it EVERYDAY and THROUGHOUT the day and parks it in the livingroom until ready to drive again. The adjustable seat and safety seat belt are a plus on this car!! Although it has so many fun features like the gearshifts,moving screen,2 pedals, electronic sounds,etc., my three year old does not use them....YET. The fact that it has a moving steering wheel is very important to him because he can turn left and right. He pretends to drive the car by dragging it with his feet all around the house. He asked me if I could put wheels on the car! If the car is so much fun to him as it is now, I could imagine if it had wheels!!! I recommend this car highly. In my opinion, it IS very durable considering the way he plays!!!"
3,Broken Plate,The basket was nice with the exception that the beautiful plate was chipped in two places.
3,Damaged,"According to recipient, recipient of this gift received a packing invoice which contained the price--tacky--and no card indicating it was a gift sent by buyer!! Also part of container was broken and a very careful examination of contents revealed that it was NOT in the package. A damaged item was therefore sent out."
3,Smaller than I expected,Alot smaller than I expected. Almost all the crackers were broken into tiny pieces
3,Southern Rock Essentials,"Good choices of southern artists and songs. It has the potential to be a 4 or 5 star album, but what happen to Atlanta Rhythm Section and Black Foot?"
4,Agatha grows up,"Finally! A less obnoxious Agatha Raisin. The business woman she was in London has emerged in her new detective agency - less bumbling, more self confident. I grew tired of Agatha's earlier rudeness to her friends and skipped several books in the series. This time she's actually friendly and appreciative of her co-workers, which makes her abrasiveness to strangers less annoying. She still doesn't have the smarts of Kinsey Millhone or the insight of Mma Ramotswe. But the draw for this series is the author's ability to bring locations alive - you can taste the salt spray. The complexity of the mystery doesn't really matter, because the author finds a way to keep you wondering what's next. And, most satisfying, Agatha realizes James is a jerk."
3,Comma-tose,"I do love Agatha Raisin, but this book fell short of Beaton's usual brilliance. The first chapter was great. After that the author brings in a dizzying array of characters going in and out. The plot was hard to believe."
4,"Fun with Agatha, Mrs. Bloxby, James and company!","In Love, Lies and Liquor, Agatha is quickly bored with everything on an even keel. Her ex-husband and neighbor, James, suggests going away on a surprise trip. Instead of the warm, tropical vistas she's envisioned, Agatha finds herself in a seedy, run-down seaside resort. Agatha always manages to stir up trouble and in no time they have a murder on their hands.Despite being set out of town, even Mrs. Bloxby manages to get in on the fun and detecting. The usual cast of supporting characters make appearances.All in all, a delightful, light-weight entertaining read."
4,Unusually convoluted plot,"James finally manages to destroy Agatha's obsession with him, and in an effort to win her back, takes her on vacation to a seedy beach resort where they wind up in the middle of a murder investigation. But when James is ready to move on to the Riviera, Agatha is determined to find the killer.Easily the most convoluted of the usually-complex plots in this series, bringing in organized crime as well as a vicious victim and family members. Agatha finds herself in more danger than usual, and the reader isn't given the clues to figure out whodunit. But I kept reading, and I was cheering Agatha for winning free of James. But the title had very little to do with the storyline."
3,Okay as a Cosy Mystery. Lacking as a Character Study.,"This is my first Agatha Raisin mystery. . . and my last. I found her obsessive-compulsive Agatha's fixation on her ex-husband an irritation. She loves him, she's over him, she loves him, she's over him. . . and the last page: she knocks on his door. Perhaps there are bright, talented, resourceful people out there who ruin their lives over what might have been. However, if I can't care for the main character, the book is truly disappointing. It was just good enough that I kept reading to find out who the murderer was.Perhaps earlier books were better, but they would be tainted with the foreknowledge of what Agatha will become."
5,M. C. Beaton Mystery,"M. C. Beaton writes under other names, but she must write a book a week! This is one of her better series...I like to follow Agatha Raisin on her crime solving mission. These are just fun books that you will get caught up in and hopefully read the whole series. There is always a newmystery being released!"
2,shame on Coleman,"This looks like - but isn't - a standard fuel bottle used for camping stoves. It is NOT interchangeable with bottles used for MSR, Primus, Optimus, and other brands of stoves. Apparently Coleman uses it for its own line of lightweight camp stoves similar to those above, but the opening size is different.Also, it doesn't have a side-vented cap that lets pressure out in a controlled manner, and it appears possibly less durable than the brands listed above. Of course Coleman has every right to have their own proprietary equipment, but then they shouldn't have made it to look so similar to all other fuel bottles. I will keep this, and use it for fuel storage and transport, but it would be much more useful with standard threading. In all, an inferior product. Shame on Coleman!"
5,Great knife!!,This is a great knife! Worth every penny! The blade is sharp and the handle is easy to grip! Highly recommended!
4,Whiteside adjustable mechanic's seat,"This seat is sturdy and easily adjustable. It was very easy to put together except for the rollers, which I had to use a rubber malot on. However, it does not roll easily over all surfaces. i.e. it doesn't roll well over carpeting. The wheels are thin and made for hard surfaces only. There is no information available on the size of the rollers, so to exchange them for wider wheels, I will have to remove a wheel and measure it. A job I haven't as yet found the strength to tackle. I would say the seat is perfect for the job it was designed for, that of a mechanic's seat."
3,Okay Unit,"Th castors are hard to install. I basically had to use a rubber mallet and press them in with difficulty. Once assembled, the seat is nice. However, it is not as well made as I expected. This is a good stool. I thought I was buying a very nice stool."
3,It does work!,"We bought these hoses for our older washing machine - we thought it'd be a good idea since we live in an apartment and a flood would bring bigger-than-life problems here. At the beginning I thought they didn't work. We put the old hoses back on; but I decided to give it another try later on. We figured out that it works only if you don't turn on the water all the way - about half way, the most; enough that it has a reasonable flow into the washing machine. If you turn on the water all the way, the flood-safe mechanism shuts off the water completely. It works fine now.I gave it three stars because I was so frustrated in the beginning and I had to figure out myself how to make them work. I wish it would have some instructions as to how much water flow these hoses allow through before it completely shuts off the flow into the washing machine. If I wouldn't have gone through that headache I would have given it 5 stars because IT DOES WORK after all.Hope this helps someone!"
1,Go Back to The Drawing Board,"This is a good idea, but its execution is dreadful. We were awakened by a water leak sensor in the middle of the night-washing machine hose burst with water spurting everywhere. Had our sensor not been working, we would have needed waders the next morning. These hoses were recommended by a plumber and after installation, the water would not come on. It seems that the slightest water pressure (even turning it on to start the water) activates the shut off valve. After spending twenty minutes trying to barely turn on the water at the spigot, it finally worked- and then it took at least twice as long to finish a load of laundry because the pressure regulator reduced the water flow severely. This morning I started a load and the water shut down. Maybe our municipal water supply changed the pressure of the city water. I hate these hoses and they are now gone. New braided hoses from the hardware store allow me to get back to work. I would give this product an ""F""."
1,No flow,Flow is 1/3 to 1/4 what my rubber hoses provided. I also had to shut the water off and disconnect 3 times because they kept detecting an overflow when I turned the water on. I'm thinking about taking them off and buying rubber ones instead.
1,Floodsafe hose thinks washing clothes is a flood!,If there was an option for zero stars I'd pick it. These hoses do not work. I was skeptical at first because I wondered how the hose would know the difference between simply turning on the washer and an actual ruptured hose. The answer is that they cannot tell the difference. Every time I turn on the washer the hoses shut off. The only way they will work is if I turn the water back to a trickle and even then they only work about 50% of the time. Don't waste your money on these things. Get 'normal' braided hoses and replace them every 5 years.
1,One Star is One Too Many,"FloodSafe is long on potential and short on execution. Save your money and buy standard stainless steel hose connectors. The connector worked briefly and then shutdown on the cold water side of our washing machine leaving the hotwater on as the only supply; since my wife did not immediately notice the failure, the washer appearing to fill normally in warm and hot wash cycles, at least 5 shirts and 3 pants were ruined by shrinkage/ distortion of fabric caused by the hot-water-only misfire. The theory of being safe from a flood is good: the FloodSafe connector device and implemented design is ROTTEN. JUNK."
1,Leaked water,These hoses leaked water. I had to take them off 10 minutes after installing them and return them to the store. This product wasted my time.
1,Should be called Bad Deal Hose,"These hoses work for about a year. Then if you have any sediment in your water, or turn off the water for any reason they start to close every time your washer tries to wash. I thought they were a great idea, especially for my vacation home, where I cannot get to the water valves easily. But I'll go back to heavy duty stainless braided hoses and replace them every 5 years as I do need to do laundry."
1,Causes problems with Kenmore washer,Beware these may not be compatible with your washing machine.....I purchased these and they would not work with my Kenmore washer...
1,shuts water off everytime you turn your water main off!!!!!!,"very very sick of these things. I have to pull the washing machine out, turn the water off, disconnect the hose, reconnect the hose, and turn the water on slowly. I have to do this everytime I leave town and turn my water off!!!!! I hate these things!!!!"
1,poorly designed,"Thank you, Amazon customers! I wondered why my machine filled so slowly. I put these on after my divorce and thought the machine sure took a long time to fill. I will buy regular hoses and change them every 5 years."
1,Did not work!,"Bought a pair of these since my washer is installed in the middle of my house. Installing cabinets above the washer, I dropped a support which landed on and snapped off the cold side connector on the plastic washing machine fill valve. Water sprayed out continuously until I turned the water off at the hose bib. Do not waste your money on this product."
1,Incompatible with gas coming thru supply line,"Watts says that their Floodsafe devices aren't compatible with homes that have gas coming in with their water, like we do on our well. The gas causes fluctuations in the water pressure, triggering the floodsafe valve to close when there is no sign of a leak. In my case, the cold side worked fine but the hot side closed off immediately everytime I tried to run a load with the setting on warm or hot. (The way the hose is plumbed, the hot side in the laundry room gets the majority of the gas.) I intend to try their IntelliFlow(tm) Automatic Washing Machine Shutoff Valve next since it relies on current being drawn by the washer and on a water sensor that sits on the floor."
1,Crummy Book,"Too much detail about stuff that's not important. Almost a re-write of the Dummies 101 book, obviously written for the money, not the principle."
4,Good Reference - Not So Good For Turorial,"This is a good reference book. If however, you're looking for lessons, or a tutorial teaching you step by step, one task building on the last task, then this book is not for you. I'm going to check out FP98 Unleashed instead - I hoped it offers more of what I'm looking for."
3,"An excellent reference, but a poor ""how to"" book.","I bought this book thinking it would help me build a webpage of my own using Frontpage 98. Unfortunatly, The book was almost as confusing as the program. Frontpage 98 is not as intuitive as most of Microsoft's products. As a result it is necessary to have a step-by-step ""how to"" book to help us ""dummies"" find our way. In the first chapter the author even explains that the book is better used as a referance. He was right. I was just as lost in the book as I was in the program. There are simpler books out there for the Frontpage uninitiated. Find them."
3,Reading Frontpage,"This is a good introductory Frontpage book and it is good for people who want to know Frontpage right away. However, if you want to learn it, you have to buy another ones. I would not recommend to buy it because it is kind of wasting money and time to read the whole book since you can get the same information if you buy a better one."
3,Great Reference book,"But not too good in the ""how to"" department. I bought a different book to get me through the things this book didn't bother to cover. I'd recommend it for beginners, but not otherwise."
4,COOL KITCHEN!,WE bought this for our daughter's 2nd birthday and she loves it. Put it together before hand because it has lots of screws. The accessories are great and good quality. Not flimsy and cheap like some pplay food. The phones rings and Barbie talks and helps cook. We love it.
3,Not the best kitchen,"I bought this toy for my almost 4-year old and 2-year old daughters. They wanted it so bad for Christmas, but hasn't been played with very much. It has a lot of screws and took a long time to put together...some of the screws were very difficult to get in, both because of tightness and because you can't manuever your hand and screwdriver around the toy itself. Once it was all together, it looked great, but the refrigerator doesn't exactly close right. Also, the sink comes out because it is not screwed down and doesn't snap in. I'm also just waiting for it to fall over, because it isn't very heavy, and I've seen it tip several times while my girls played with it. The food pieces are very sturdy plastic, but there aren't enough pieces. I think we'll end up using food from other toys that we have, just so there's enough to go around! There are only 2 plates and 2 cups, along with 2 sets of forks and spoons. Once my 3rd daughter grows up, I'm afraid she'll be left out!"
3,My daughter LOVES it but I am a little disappointed!,"My daughter absolutely loves it! I am disappointed though. The fridge door doesnt close right and all the other doors come off on a regular basis! It is very light and not exactly sturdy. For the money, I think it should have been a little better. It took a very long time to put together and the screws were virtually impossible to get in. The sink doesnt attach to it and the untensils do not hang on the hooks very well. My daughters absolutely LOVE it though so I am happy for that. I am just sick and tired of having to put the doors back on ALL THE TIME!"
3,"OK toy, but not very durable","I bought this toy for my girls last year for christmas and was very disappointed. It is very flimsy and was even as I put it together. The door for the refrigerator never stayed shut. Not very good quality. The talking feture was the best part, but didn't make up for the fact that it just looked cheap. I bought a wooden set this year and am much more satisfied, your better off with wooden or little tykes/fisher price."
2,Cheap constructioin,What a dissapointment to purchase this item and find that the product is poorly contrustructed. Doors don't stay closed. My granddaughter is very disappointed.
2,A bit disappointed,"Much smaller than I anticipated (I should have read the description more carefully). Also, less substantial and less detailed than expected. Pretty but not really worth the price ($45)"
5,A charming children's book,This was was daughter's favourite book from the library when she was little. I was delighted to be able to track down a copy to give her for Xmas. She is now thirty but her smile when she saw the gift and her pleasure in re-reading it confirmed my choice.
3,Not sure it's BPA and PVC free,"Our 8-month-old received this toy set for Christmas. It seems like a great idea, but the rubber is so soft I suspected it might contain PVC (or even BPA for that matter, although it's soft). There is no mention of this on the product packaging, nor can I find any information about it online. I wonder how a reviewer knows it definitely does not contain either of these chemicals...?"
5,...,Pam Munoz Ryan is a wonderful writer. I love the book The Flag We Love. I love all the interesting facts about our flag. My favorite page is when she explains Betsy Ross who created the American Flag. I really enjoyed reading about our flag.
5,...,The Flag we Love is the best book. The reason I like the book is because she did a great job and Ralph did a good job with the pictures.
4,From a student,Ralph Masiello is an illustrator. One of his books is The Flag We Love. On each page a flag is on the picture. Jerry Palotta gives a lot of information in the story.
5,Brandon,My favorite Pam Munoz Ryan book is The Flag We Love. My favorite part is when they showed the Vietnam wall. It shows you how many people died for our country. And I like how it's in poetry form and I like the pictures.
3,Big .. but works,fineIt's an OK battery no complaints !!Finefinefinefine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine
1,laughable bit of Orientalism,"Being an American Druze, I read this book hoping that someone knowledgable about the Middle East and the Druze people had written a good bit of fiction. I found it full of stock characters with stock knowledge. Any standard jingoistic villain could have been inserted. Basic story, good American white guy has his family threatened by evil, foreign Arab terrorist. Throw in 'secret' manuscripts and a shoot out in a dark library. Except for it having an Arab antagonist, it sounded an awful lot like a really old Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn movie. If Tom Clancy is too heavy for you, just check out Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn movies. Pass this book by. If you must buy it, use it to keep that kitchen table from wobbling so you can have a steady surface to read some real literature."
1,I think that I know the title of the movie,"I think that one of the reviewers was thinking of the Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn movie ""Foul Play"". I did read this book and it does resemble that movie. The movie is much better"
3,Mid-Eastern Thriller,Very good description of the Mid-East. Ideal for a 1 hour sit-com. Very good reading on a cross-country plane ride.
3,Ethnographers and anthropologists beware,"This disc, which comes in one of those cardboard open-up package formats, is nice-looking, but the buyer should be aware that the music on it is slightly...unusual. I don't mean it's exotic though, on the contrary, it's actually surprisingly familiar. All 20 tracks are ukelele renditions of 50's surf rock era songs. Now, I'm not sure if that's big over in Papua New Guinea, it must be, but it's not what I was looking for. I was hoping for traditional Polynesian music, flutes and zithers and such. If I really wanted what's on this disc, I would have bought Nippers Hits of the 50's or Don Ho's greatest. I did give the disc three stars for the packaging quality and the quality of the recording."
3,Not quite book of the year,"1989 must have been a piss poor year for books because this novel is not even remotely a top-rate story. Its a decent read that passes the time but there are some flaws. For one, Dick's family is virtually ignored, just people that live and work with him. I really could not tell you a thing about his wife other than she wasn't so pleased about the boat. His sons? Uh he loved them, beyond that I have no clue.Secondly, the writing is a bit dull; short brief sentences with a lack of flow. As some other reviewer wrote, it felt like I was reading a story written by a English Comp. 101 student.It isn't a total bore. I kept on reading to see how he would come up with the money to pay for the boat. The drug-running stories and his other jobs made the book readable. Its when it got into his relationship with Elise that slowed things up and made it hard to read."
1,"Good enough story telling for one star, but come on....","I finally finished the book a month after throwing it across the room when Dick Pierce set the engine in his new boat. Insulting to those of us who know the process of bedding the engine. Those precious bolts are set in a critical pattern within a human hair's width between laminated wood tied structurally to or through the keelson. What don't you ever ever do? Let the engine mounts scrape the threads of those virgin bolts no matter how dramatic the sound may read. If you do it on the page and get a National Book Award, well fine. But don't expect clemency from readers who know fakery when it scrapes their threads."
3,Spartina,"Great story-author has some dialog that doesn't make a lot of sense, but the book takes you on a thrilling ""ride."""
3,"Good, but ...","I liked the way this book tried to present the dilemmas someone is faced with trying to define and live a good life. It raised some very important questions, without providing pat answers. This, with the very good descriptive writing and the interesting characters made reading the book worthwhile. But having said that, the way the characters and plot developed did not ring true for me. The pitches life threw at the characters were very showy, but predictable and usually seemed to wind up base hits."
2,Flawed but literate,"I did not like Dick Pierce nor did I like Elsie. Since these are the two main characters in the book, and since the Rhode Island shore and lobstering, etc., are something I know nothing about, this book did not enthrall. And the icky explicit sex talk was a definite minus. This book was a disappointment, but I thought the hurricane parts were interesting and memorable, tho I know little about hurricanes, having not been in a hurricane area for many many years. And the ending was a lousy ending, I thought."
5,I have many dream books and this is the best book ever print,I have many dream books and this is the best book ever printed on dream interpretation. It is easy access and quite accurate for interpretating your dreams
5,It's In There!,"Like the spaghetti sauce commercial says, ""It's in there!"" I had one of those dreams where I was trying to solve a problem having to do with a spacecraft heatshield and a mechanical engineer. A friend of mine had this book on her livingroom table, so I looked up these things, not really expecting them to be listed. To my pleasant surprise, they were. I was able to interpret the dream from what I found in this book. I've looked at a number of other dream interpretation books, and this one seems exceptionally complete."
1,Book title is misleading,"Based on the title, Classic Knits from the 1930s-1960s, I was expecting more traditional patterns with classic lines. The book should be titled, ""Mostly '60s"" or something like that. I was only able to judge this book by the photo on the cover (ha! remember the old saying), so I thought I would be getting lots of classic, un-trendy patterns. Instead, most of the women's patterns are exaggerated 1960s wonders. However, the men's patterns are classic and might be worth your while. If you have subscribed to Vogue Knitting magazine over the past 15 years, you will already have most of the patterns. Silly me, I thought the editor of this book would have had the imagination to publish other patterns from the original Vogue Knitting instead of being lazy."
2,Not a lot of stylish patterns,"If you really want a great book on stylish vintage knits, I'd suggest you buy Sarah Dallas' Vintage Knits. The patterns there were more form fitting. The patterns in the Vogue book were a little uninspiring -- they were patterns that you could pretty much find elsewhere. But it's an okay book for beginners and intermediate knitters."
3,Hopelessly outdated!,"I was hoping that this writer had produced an updated version of her original 1993 book. No such luck.The book does some have interesting ideas for article writers, but beware. She advises that you have plenty of stamps and envelopes (!), do research in the library, and produce neat copies of all your submissions.If you can mentally update for yourself, this dinosaur might spark a few good writing ideas. But the world that existed when Emerson's advice was first written is long, long gone!"
5,Beautiful shoes,"Very nice shoe for my daughter, alittle stiff but nice support and strong soles. And overall just pretty for a little girl in a beautiful neutral color."
3,"makes me a little crazy, but not for carrots","It's okay, i cant get past the Galleon (1st level) but its cute and the first game i got I wuold recomend it just make sure you can take a little frustration once in a while"
5,Thirst.... for more,"I'm a big,big, McCammon fan from the early 80's. First there was Baal, then Night Boat, then this masterpiece of horror story telling. What a great read. This was my entertainment at the end of the day..., just looking forward to having the hairs on my back and arms go up again... what a rush. It's a shame a movie hasn't been made of it.... but then, not many books-turned- movies have really gotten it right. I hope McCammon continues to write, even if his stories aren't in the same vein!!"
5,The definitive in Vamp lore!!,"I read this book a long long time ago, but it was then and still is the best of the best!!! I have it in my library, and i reread this about once every 2 yrs. It still takes me by surprise, with the sheer reality like setting. I love this book, read it, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Pure Garbage,"There is a reason why McCammon stopped publishing this book and its not becuase it is good. I am a huge McCammon fan and I have read every book he has written. I could never get a hold of this book and it was always on my most wanted list. Too my suprise, if not horror, I couldnt even finish the book as it was so ridicuosly bad I could not believe it. McCammon must have done one draft only of this as this is a very poor work.Overall the sound of McCammon and vampires together sounds great but the execution was awful. If McCammon wrote this book ""today"", I feel that the book would be great but unfortunately he wrote the book when he was still very green."
1,Burn the fist half,"At the end of this book, McCammon expresses that he wanted a huge cast. He accomplished that. He hit every literary cliche character he could find and put them in the book. And I cared about absolutely none of them.The shallow news writer, the photographer, the jaded cop, the priest, the kid, the comedian... and many, many others who are given pages of characterization but who turn out to be nobodies, and all of whom are patently stereotypes. The pothead near the end solidified it for me.The comedian's wife was my favorite character, she seemed so against type. But she actually was the type: voodoo. Cliche hello.Horrible book. The ending? I won't spoil it but I will say it's the stupidest end I've ever seen."
5,the best vampire book i ever sunk my teeth into,"this was also my first mccammon book. been hooked ever since. makes you wish there really were vampires out there. the characters were believable and in a strange way, likeable. please robert.......get back to writing!!!! i can only speak for myself but i am in a black void of despair since gone south. please, esaelp, come back to the literary world to give us mere mortals more snacks to gnaw on! I'M HUNGRY!!!!"
5,"Los Angeles, besieged in ""They Thirst"", is scary!!!","I've read this book three times in the last 10 years and I still enjoy the terror. This is a well written book from cover to cover. The vivid description of the vampires and their abilities, with the backdrop of a city unable to defend itself, makes for intense reading. The individual heros and villians and the climatic battle of good versus evil will stay with you long after you put this book down."
4,World famous needlework author,"Gerda Bengtsson is a world-leading designer and teacher of embroidery in the Danish Handcraft Guild. This large paperback book was published in 1972 and so there are few color plates. I added the images above: the cover of the book, a finished embroidery and the beautiful colors of Danish Flower Thread which are extremely popular. The book is a teaching manual for how to design for cross stitch and other techniques of surface embroidery. One might complain that there are hardly any graphs here. But that's not what this book is for. It's to lead you through designing for yourself. The writing is quite clear and the large illustrations of the stitches are nice. It's a pleasure to read and the B&W photos of the steps from line drawing to graphing are interesting. I give the book 3 stars for lack of color photos and general low quality of the pages (than we're used to), 5 stars for the rich content for an average of 4 stars."
4,Interesting views overweighed by technical terminologies,This book is a fascinating read as one learns about how medical journals dedicated themselves to sexual psychotic behaviors in the Napoleonic era of France. It seems that medical journals were relished by many as the pornographic/erotic material of its age. The problem though with this book is that it fails to draw any conclusions even as ot proclaims itself to be an analysis and psychological study of historical material. The writer often bogs down the writing with lots of technical writing and phrasings while often putting in repitious reportage of events. It is an interesting read for someone fascinated with either this era of history or with the evolution of psychology but more than likely will leave a cold impression on those that have only a passing interest in the material or are hoping for titulation.
2,Season 3 Part 2 of Classic TMNT,"We now get a second set of Season 3 episodes of the show Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Original Series. While this is still the same as the previous volumes have been, though that doing things this way it's taking a while to get all the episodes out on DVD in their seasons that they aired in. While I can't say that anything new was done with this set cause once again the episodes are on one DVD, and the each of the episodes I feel that they haven't been properly restored up to this point of this volume being released. Normally when handling old animated shows you there have been companies that handled them properly and managed to restore them to their original way of viewing them. Though there isn't much to see in this besides the next 12 episodes of Season 3, this set gets 2.5 stars out 5."
2,"Great DVD, smashed case!","When I first opened this package, I noticed it wasn't wrapped in bubble wrap.Then upon looking at the case, I noticed that I was smashed! The DVD itself is great, worksflawlessly. But that isn't the point, the case should be in perfect condition as I bought itbrand new.I'm really getting fed up of if receiving packages that are not wrapped up in bubble wrapand end up getting damaged in the process. If this ever happens again, I am going to reconsiderin using Amazon for future purchases.Neil, England"
3,TMNT Original series,"This is an awesome 12 episode dvd of the original tv series. You can't go wrong for the price and the episodes are just as I remember them. My only complaint is that the third season should've been released together, but this doesn't reflect Amazon, their service is top notch."
3,hope to have the whole series,The price is unbeatable here. I hope to have the whole series when all of the episodes are released on DVD. Especially since I didn't get to watch the entire series after it changed to Saturday Mornings on CBS. It will be great to catch up on what I missed over the years.
3,Leaves Out a Lot,"Despite including several hits in their original versions, this CD also offers some filler that could easily have been replaced by genuine hits, many of which are absent, for some reason."
3,Review,"This book had a lot of facts. And I would write more but I am on a time crunch, just wanted to note that it helped in my history class."
4,By far Superior to the dreamcast version,"Don't listen to the dreamcast owners who think this game is worse then the Dreamcast version! There ARE improved graphics, more character costumes, new stages, new characters, and tons more replay value over the Dreamcast version, in which everything is already unlocked. Still, while there are many costumes to unlock, once everyone has there fourth costume, it gets a bit boring to get the rest. The story is boring, but who plays a fighting game for story? The english voice acting is funky, but subtitles can be activated with Japonesse voice acting. The main beef of the game is the fighting system which is exellent, but the computer can be vary cheap, even on easier difficultys. I personally prefer Tekken Tag Tournament, but if you already played out Tekken 3, get this. Get both if you can, but if not get this."
2,The Graphics were terrible,"This game did have like 10 more stages then the dreamcast version which i like. but i think the graphics for this were terrible. if your going to buy this game buy the dreamcast version. the gameplay is alot more fun and the graphics are alot better. Plus if you havent gotten playstation 2 yet. dont worry about it, the system hasnt come out with good games yet."
1,BAD GRAPHICS,Dead or alive 2 was a port from the dreamcast version its graphics were not enhanced. It looks exactly like the dreamcast version and plays like the dreamcast version. The game was written for the dreamcast hardware its a poor port wth no extra characters and no improvement to the terrible control scheme and bad combo system. If you really want this game get the dreamcast version instead. Tekken tag tournament is better anyway.
5,Alot of fun,"This game is alot of fun.Anyone who has a PS2,loves action and fighting games and loves this game series will have a ball with this game. I am waiting to get it."
4,beauty meets function,"This game is a great fighter. Look at interactive backgrounds, a fair number of different fighting styles, nice # of characters, easy to get the grasp of but hard to get good at. Beginers will like the ease at first and appreciate the difficulty of intentionally doing moves as they play on. all in all one of the better fighters on the system... just a shame that they moved to X box with pt three and DOA volley ball"
4,Very Impressive,"DOA Hardcore is one of the better fighting games on the PS2 but like all fighting games, it has it's draw backs.The graphics are excellent, almost perfect. No shady pseudo dimensional graphics that when you get too close, they become a flat surface. The fights can go almost anywhere from down the side of a mountain to out of a Dojo to down balconies at the opera house.The tagging options are phenomenol! The tag moves are not only impressive but just plain out fun to watch. And even the singles story mode is impressive.The only reason I'm docking this game a star is because the endings for a lot of the characters are about as entertaining taking 2 thumb tacks (ya got em?). O.k. now that you have those thumb tacks, put them in your eyes and close your eyelids. The endings just didn't do it for me. A 5 second boring spot with your character doing something stupid (ex: Zach snowboarding down a hill? PLEASE!).Other than that, get this game and have at it! Have fun!"
4,Pretty good fun,"This game is quite good as beat-em-ups go. It has a good cast of characters and I really only dislike a couple of them. The graphics are pretty darn good and the fighting styles excellent. There are several varieties of game play and alot of replay value.The only things that I do not like are the story mood is disjointed and way to short. It never goes into any of the characters in any deapth and only offers bizarre one line comments throughout the game.And 2, the bouncing aspects of the gals needs to be more. If you are in for a penny go in for a pound. This game is for an older audience anyway so add more bounce!!"
5,If you like to fight... this game is just right!,"First of all... I am a young reviewer. So, NOW that I got that behind me, I can start reviewing the game. When I first got PS2, this was the 1st game I played. I played until I had a headache, and my eyes hurt. The graphics are great, game play is fun, different modes and challenges keep you entertained for hours! Plus, I'm always excited when I discover a new costume for one of the characters. A lot of fun... at least is was for me. I have to say you HAVE to get this game! I find it better than Tekken Tag Tournament, which is considered the best arcade style fighting game out there!"
3,"Great Graphics, Good Moves, Dumb Story line and Voice Acting","This game definatly shows off the PS2's graphic capabilities. It looks great! The moves are pretty awesome too. Hard to access alot of them though (for me at least, not a avid fighter gamer). But the storyline is abysmal. Maybe 4-6 chars have a storyline that makes sense and the rest are just movie clips to show off the PS2. The Voice acting for this game is about as bad as the storyline. Buy the game for the fighting not the storyline and mute the voice acting and turn on the subtitles."
2,Just not for me,I'm primarily a 2-D fighting fan that decided to try this for cheap. I put it in for 3 season plays & just didn't like it. Maybe I'll get around to it again someday & reviese my review but for now I've got a NeoGeo Battle Colliseum tourney to finish & King of Fighters 11 lined up after that so it's not a priority at all.
3,Not as good as the Dreamcast version,"Lets face it people, what's more important? Slightly better graphics with a few more color schemes for the same costumes and two or three new arenas, or more responsive controls?That's right, more responsive controls.All the eye-candy in the world won't amount to squat if the game is more sluggish!Being a vet of DOA2 for Dreamcast, I was excited about the PS2 version, so I bought it. For some reason, I can't execute counters as intuitively as I could on the DC version. This is a very serious problem, because counters are vital in DOA2.I can't stress the importance of this lack of responsiveness in the game except to advise you to buy the Dreamcast version, if possible, or Tekken Tag for PS2. This will satisfy your fighting needs as well as DOA2.I feel the PS2 version isn't as responsive because the game was designed on Dreamcast hardware, and ported over to the PS2.What a shame..."
4,"DOA3 may be out, but DOA2 still owns joo...","Graphics-The charcters are great, especially the clothing and there's a lack of any clipping. But the best part would have to be the arenas (Especially the Aerial Garden). It's awesome how the water splashes as the people fight and they thought of pretty much everything in here (Reflections, etc.)Gameplay-Heard some complaints, but this game handles fine and the counter system is a nice touch as long as it isn't overused. But this game is probably best with a few friends.Sound- Switch the voicing to Japanese, trust me. The Engilsh is just a bit awful.Story- Not really a story, but hey, it's for the fighting not the storyline but they could do a better job.Overall- This game is definetly one of my favorites. And yeah, while the women are a plus, you can't deny the fact that this is one of the better fighting games. There's a few flaws here and there but it's easy to get over it."
2,did not keep my interest,"Maybe another English teacher like he would love his writing but I found his Elizabethan or old Latin writing style with his long convoluted sentences turning this way and that to be very tiresome and hard to follow where the story was going. I prefer simpler, more direct sentences with flow and vivid description that stay with the start of the story. He jumped around so much I had hard time following where he was going. I lost interest and couldn't even get through the first half of the book. It did have a lot of history involved with his stories but yet it was his writing style that if found tiresome and boring. Just not my cup of tea. Maybe it could be yours."
1,Very disappointed...,Well I bought this under my brother's account and instead of getting my hamtaro stickers I got bob the builder.
3,READ BEFORE BUYING,"First off, this mirror will fit 89-91 honda civic for sure. not positiv about others.All and all the mirror fit the car it is eactly like factory, but what they dont tell you is that the screws that are already on a 91 civic are too small to hold the mirror, i happened to have 3 extra screws that fatter so they would hold the mirror, once thats done the mirror works looks like it should.The bad is that this company doesnt care to protect the product, i got the box and it was beat to crap, fortunatly my mirror wasnt effected. So go ahead and buy it it gets the job done, just make sure you get screws to hold it."
4,works,"works good. Glass is a little wavy but you really don't notice it after a while. Worth the price. On the interior of the car you need to modify the block off plate to accept the mirror adjusting lever, unless you can find an OE plate from an Si hatch."
1,Self Indulgent,"Projektor are an atmospheric indie band from Canada. While their album Red Wolf Glass is well written, recorded and played, it dosen't have that spark that separates it from the pack (let alone providing for interesting listening), even though it tries ever so hard to do so. This over-trying is another one of the album's faults, creating a bombastic epic feeling that I don't think really works in this instance. Projektor have made a technically proficient record, it's just that it's a) self-indulgent and over the top and b) come out at the wrong time. We don't need version 17653 of OK Computer. Radiohead have moved on, why can't everyone else."
3,Red Carbet Rating,The movies where okay. Usually the movies take about a week to get to me so I got them no problem.
5,Boyzone at their very best!,"This has to be the best Boyzone song ever, it just touches the very soul. Deeply romantic and a must purchase for any fan."
4,Pretty decent with a couple of minor issues.,"This stripper works as one would expect a wire stripper would. My two complaints about it are the center stud doesn't hold the jaws as tightly together as it should, and a couple of the cutouts don't seem properly sized, though this could be not Paladin's fault, but instead cheap wire.4/5 stars primarily due to the stud being a tad loose. Other than that, nothing big... it's sharp in the right places and does the trick."
4,MOH:I,"The backround music is great. The bullets are NOT realistic in 3rd person,though. The levals are excellent,and the storyline is great."
1,to hard,this game was insanely hard i couldn't even beat the first level. its the only game i own that i havn't beaton
5,poncho,Any one that has ever had a pet will relate to everything that is in this book. Especially anyone that has been very close to the pet and they have since passed.
3,Where is the Accademics?,"I just hate to slam a book about my favorite sculptor, so I couldn't give less than three stars. Even the pictures aren't that good, many are black and white. The real irritation factor here is the author's obcession with the artist's biography. Is it so outlandish to think someone might ""get"" this work simply because it so strongly appeals to the human element in us all? What would all the art reviewers do if they had no access to the details of an artist's life? ...If the art journals refused to publish the ""Enquirer"" method of analysis and required something that was... less sensational ...more objective ...more ACCADEMIC, maybe? I'm sure Mr. Friedman meant no disrespect for Ms. von Rydingsvard, but did he mean to review the art or the artist? It is extremly patronizing that primarily female artists are subjected to this type of analysis. Let's get it together, boys!"
4,English grammar is fundamental,"I've been involved as a user with this textbook since its 7th edition and still find it to be the best grammar text out there. Its depth of knowledge and organization assist the reader in understanding the various grammatical units writers can use, as well as how to use them correctly. The only weaknesses I've identified are typos, repeated examples in the same or adjacent chapters, occasional incorrect answers in the key, the discussion of subjects and verbs placed before parts of speech (the most basic grammatical unit), and the omission of interjections and conjunctions from the parts of speech chapter. I do love this text and will continue to use it."
4,Good Song,I've always liked this song and it was a nice addition to my collection. I'm usually happy with the music downloads I look for and download.
5,Dont judge a book by its cover,Up front it looks like one of those goofy all the pretty girls wants the extremely nice kinda nurdy guy. But the first couple of episodes are the cute stuff and the lame like the adult groupies that wants the guy gone but after the dumb stuff there are some real serious sceans in this one that will tug at the heart strings. There is some nudity but not gross nudity out of nowhere it is actually in good taste. Would not let my 11 year old watch it but it is definately one that will stay in my collection. Towards the last CD it was almost addictive like crack to see how it all ends. The ending is good that is all I will say :)
4,Pretty decent but really twisted towards the end!,"Pretty decent anime as far as this genre goes but darn is it twisted towards the end! First, he treats one girl as if she was a slave and then she flips her lid and goes psycho .... no surprise there. Was kind of hoping for a darker twist, like her going psycho and then end up killing him because by the end of the series he was really starting to annoy me ... oh well. The committing suicide to save the girl he chose is fairly twisted if you as me. Heck if I'd slash my wrist with a box cutter save some idiot with a death wish .... lol!Overall, it's an ok anime ... seen better!"
4,Its a must get!!!!!,OK so this is one of my fave animes it has great story and kind a twist near the end. It came in perfect order
5,Awesome Anime Adaption,An awesome anime adaption of the visual novel. I only wish that this was available on Blu-ray. Great story and art design.
4,a stong 4 stars from a baricco fan,"I read this as a fan of Alessandro Baricco (ocean sea is a personal favorite). When I began reading I was surprised at the rhythm of the text, because it seemed quite different than the long flowing poetic sentences of Ocean Sea and Silk. Once I settled into his concise style, I appreciated the gruesome battles more than expected. In the end, I was introduced to a style and context of fiction literature that I was previously unfamiliar with. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in Greek Epics or warfare."
5,"Fun Game, from a 15 yr old!","I didn't buy this game for fast paced adventure (as some reviewers seemed to), I bought it for a game that I could pick up and play and HAVE FUN! Anyone who wants a fun car (or bus !) game should certainly buy this. The only other thing I could want in this game is more difficulty levels to add to the replay value, but I still love it!"
1,DON'T BUY FROGGER!,This game [is terrible]! At first it seemed like it was going to be a good game dodging alligators and hopping on lillipads...But it only has 5 levels and there all almost exactly the same. And the graphics are bad plus it's[too much] for five minutes of good gameplay.
3,OK game,"This game is fun, but the levels are a lot the same, except they get harder! The object of the game is to get five frogs across a busy highway with fast moving cars,and cross a river filled with snakes, crocodiles, and diving turtles while staying within the time limit. You can also collect extra points as you go. I would recommend this game if you want to play something that doesn't take a lot of strategy!"
3,too young and hard,"My 6 year old likes this game on our computer, it is more forgiving. You sometimes think you are missing the car but you end up hitting it and when you jump to the final resting place you have to be right on the mark and on the computer game you get a little lee-way. He does not enjoy this game but he does try to play it. I think you should be 8 or 9 maybe to play. I have played myself (35) and while it is entertaining it does get old fast. Cute game if you can get it on sale though."
3,"Challenging game , bad graphics.","My mom told me she liked this game as a kid, so I got it. The graphics aren't as good as they are on the cover, but the game is pretty hard. Level 1:Try to pass a few rows of cars (some fast, some slow), then jump on lily pads and frogs to get to little caves. You fill in the caves with bugs. The next levels are simalar with more concepts. It was OK."
2,A waste of money,"I think that this game is pretty bad! I have played the playstation one version and it is a lot better! That actually has different levels that actually look different a nd are 3-d! This game is horrible! The screen just looks so boring! It's just some cars and stuff that you have to get past! Since all of the levels are basically the same, there is no point in trying to beat the levels because there's nothing different about the next level! The game doesn't even save high scores when you get them! There also isn't any backround music! Don't waste your money on this game! You will be very dissapointed unless you are older and liked the game how it was when you were a kid or something!"
3,Neat but strange,I guess you could call it neat. Though I traded my Knockout Kings 2000 but I shoukdn't have. The reason I traded it was because it was only for GBC and I don't have GBC! The reason it's sort of dull is that I don't know the object of the game! But it's still cool.
2,A Compliment to Jean Restayn - excellent!,"Together with the first book, Tiger 1 on the Eastern front, this book tells the story of the most feared tank of World War II- The German Tiger IE heavy tank. From the Tunisian plains to the snowfields of the Bulge, this tank crushed the ground with its heavy tracks. Jean Restayn has managed to capture the feel of the tank perfectly in this book. As a modeler, I find this book to be amongst the most coveted in my collection."
5,great book,"by far one of the funniest and best written books i've ever read. payne does a great job of getting into the mind of a 14 year old. the book flows great, with so much going on at one time, much like real life, yet with adventures that could never be imagined by a normal mundane mind. seriously a great book."
3,Two DVD disk problem,"The DVD package arrived OK. The first discs we tried were fine, but two of them have faults."
5,purchase of P D James dvd's,I am very pleased with my purchase and the whole transaction. It was a pleasure to buy something this way.
3,No subtitles,"The stories are good, and I have all the books, BUT!The heavy British accents are difficult for an American to understand. I missed at least half the words. Beyond that, the British talk very fast. If the actor speaks in cockney, forget it.Why no subtitles? Many British films have them, and they make it much easier for Americans to understand. I have watched British films where subtitles were not used because the actors either spoke slower or there was less of a British accent. Let's face it, the words may be the same, but the spoken word is very different.The heavy accents spoiled this collection for me, and I doubt most Americans will understand the actors much better than I did."
3,"Excellent Series, Only Fair DVD Product","There are other excellent reviews of the contents of this DVD set. (I also recommend reading the Wikipedia entry on this series.) I want to mention and emphasize the 2 major negative themes of this product: 1. I also received a defective set (disc 11) that was replaced with a set that also had a defective disc (disc 11) and ultimately had to send the whole thing back. 2. The sound quality is sometimes/frequently marginal and no subtitles are available. The Special Features are virtually non-existent; at least the Inspector Morse set had some trivia about each episode and a couple of documentaries. That being said, the depth of the characterizations and stories by P.D. James is probably superior to most of the other BBC/Mystery series."
3,Where oh where are the subtitles?,"The P.D. James Dalgliesh TV series were mostly outstanding. The DVD collection, which I bought, has a major flaw. The sound track is poor, for instance, if the characters are walking on gravel, the sound of shoe on gravel is the predominant sound. The Dalgliesh actor, Ray Marsden tends to speak quite softly and somewhat mumble. Well, that's the idea. Subtitles are necessary and the lack thereof discredits this Essential Collection."
1,PD James the essential collection,"When I finally began to view this series of 8 mysteries on 13 disks, I discovered that disks were missing and disks were mislabeled. The first disk, Death of an Expert Witness, parts I and II were correctly labeled but the disk labeled Death of an Expert Witness Part III contained Part 2 of A Taste of Death. All of the other disks were correctly labeled but there was no second disk for Dath of an Expert Witness. In addition, although the collection was supposed to include Original Sin, there was no disk with that label in the collection. What a disapointment! I have tried to contact Amazon.com to ask about this but can find no way to find out how to get a corrected version of this set. I am very diaapointed in amazon.com."
5,Great series- one bad dvd,"Roy Marsden is Dalgliesh! Great series, but one dvd is a copy of another one. So you don't get to see the 2nd half of the first story. Amazon was great and shipped a 2nd set, but it had the same problems. Guess I'll try again in a few months."
3,"Dagliesh is great, the DVD set is not.","I love this series, love the characters, love Roy Marsden. This DVD set, though, is defective, so beware. I returned my first set for a replacement and the SECOND set has the exact same defective DVD (#11--will not load at all)."
2,"Nothing Can Match ""Indestructible""....","The best thing they ever did was ""a warm solid love nothing can penetrate""....The track was ""Indestructible""...The one about ""Gloom and Doom"", ""Bernadette"", and ""Standing in the Shadows"" was OK, but I would buy a Diana Ross or Brian McKnight album instead-the recent ones..."
2,SO-SO Umbrella net,"Ok, idea is great but for lack of material or not for a 9' umbrella as stated.Like another user, the net did NOT reach the deck surface properly. If I had a smaller umbrella ( an 8' or 7' ) it would have been fine.( BTW, noticed in ad picture they closed the umbrella a little bit to make the net perfect on the floor )I spent about a 1/2 hour adjusting the net to fit proper to no avail. When I pulled on one side, it just lifted the other ( there was really no more give in the elastic top ring ).So, if you have a 7' or 8' umbrella it will more than likely work ok, but not for a 9' as in the ad.Quality of materials not the issue, just the lack of lenght!"
3,Size matters!,"I ordered this product last Friday because I wanted to sit on my patio on Saturday but after all this rain..the mosquitos and gnats were insane! I got it Saturday morning which was great! Ok, the worst part was I had to put it together. Well, my husband I did it and it took about 15-20 minutes. As one reviewer mentioned it is definitely too small for the 9inch umbrella! But, since I am adventurous and decided I would make it work, I cut the elastic that goes over the umbrell at each seam to open it up more and started with shorter cuts and made them larger going all the way around until the screen hit the ground. There was plenty of material still on the top of the umbrella so it wouldn't slide off. The hardest part were those poles that go around the bottom that never really matched up perfectly. But, the material is very sturdy, the mosquito's or gnats can't get in unless they sneak in when you open the zipper. I know I can't send it back because I cut it, but it works fine now!"
1,"Literally STINKS! Hated it, way too short, does not work at all!","We're extremely disappointed in this item, it is defective, we set it up & immediately took it down within 2 minutes, very unhappy because our patio umbrella is not huge but standard 8 ft, this just did not fit, it ended up dangling with over 1 ft of space around the bottom, not as advertised keeping bugs out would be impossible.Also, the odor & stench the entire thing had was overpowering & absolutely nauseating, when my husband 1st opened it these black dusty particles clouded out & he was unable to avoid partially inhaling them & was coughing for over 20 minutes, NOT good.A very cheaply made & unusable product!"
1,started out good,"When we first bought the netting, we loved the idea. It kept the bugs out. It was somewhat easy to put up. Of course there is a but. We found we had to take down the netting whenever it would rain. We forgot a couple of times and it finally ripped the material of the unbrella. So all in all it was a good idea, not a good product."
2,product fair,product very good but plug mechanism on water tubing anchor is hard to un-open later and ruptures the plastic cusing leakage.
4,To Brave Alaska,"I've lived in Alaska and know what a vast wilderness it is. This is a true story and I have no reason not to believe the facts. However, thestory line was a bit short on facts. The premise of the last half of the story was the rescue. Although I don't have first hand knowledge of the events of the rescue, well, when it was found out that two kids were lost in the wilderness, there would have been aircraft of all kinds involved. The Alaska search and rescue, the National Guard, C.A.P and others whould have been involved. The idea that one aircraft and onehelicopter and a boat were the only ones looking is absurd."
1,Works only as access point,"This thing is worthless as a gateway router - nice features, but does not work well. - works fine as an access point only."
4,AWESOME SONGS! But...,"Like a previous person reviewed, the songs are a little short. Compared to Isis and other bands Zozobras longest song is about 5 minutes and the CD is 37:37 long. Its cool, all the songs are very enjoyable. The bassist/vocalist is from a band Cave-In. Cave-In was good but the vocals were too girly for me. Hes a great bassist and he uses a very powerful, deathgripping voice in Zozobra. Truely, a grand CD and you'll be rocking out for awhile after you hear this CD."
5,My favorites,"I absolutely love these books. They can take one heck of a beating and still look good when cleaned up. They are comfortable, warm and waterproof. The removable sock liners actually work wonderful and are very effective. On top of everything else, they look good. At this time, these are my favorites and I suppose they will remain as such until something better comes along."
4,Mushroom Planet meets King Arthur mythos,"This book was definitely different in tone from the rest of the series. The premise is that the inhabitants of the Mushroom Planet are related to today's Welsh, and the boys and Mr. Bass are caught up in a mystery involving the hidden grave of Arthur and Guinevere and the evil forces which caused his overthrow. The final scene in Wales is utterly chilling and still sends shivers down my spine. If you can accept the rather silly premise at face value, you have a dark and thrilling read ahead of you. Very enjoyable for those who like a little mystery to deepen their light fantasy reading."
3,Disturbing.,"Having read the first two Mushroom Planet books in third grade, I was very eager to read this final part of the adventures. I vaguely remember that the book dealt with the king of the Mushroom Planet coming to earth and finding descendants of the planet there, I also seem to recall that Mr. Bass is one, but I wouldn't swear to it. However, the chief thought that comes to my mind when I think of this book is how different it was from the former books of the series. The tone was utterly different-heavy and dark, and I remember that the ending was almost grotesque in its flavor. I wouldn't recommend this for young children - they'll probably find it very weird, but for fans of the series, you'll find a different, twisted look at the Mushroom Planet and its inhabitants."
4,Too much or too little,"I thought this was an OK book. It surely was an over view of 20,000 years of indian history. The author did his research and knew his stuff. However, I thought he was a little scattered and I found it difficult to keep up with the narative as he skipped forward and backwards in time a lot. I found it hard to keep up with. He was an Indian advocate and took their side in most things. He also used words that made what he was wanting to tell difficult to understand. Why use obscure words when more common ones are available to use? Was it just to show he knew these words?"
5,book review,This is a great for my daughter who is very interested in the American. From my perusal it is a very detailed book on the American Indian culture
4,"Quite a challenge, but fun...","Conker's Pocket Tales is a pretty good game for the GBC, though it can be very frustrating at times due to the fact that you can loose lives so quickly.Conker's birthday party has been ruined by an Evil Acorn (yes, an acorn), and he's stolen Conker's gifts and his friend, Berri. It is up to you to get his presents back and defeat a variety of the Evil Acorn's bosses to get to Berri.This game is pretty addictive, but once again, it's frustrating and sometimes it gets hard. What is a game without a good challenge, though? I would not recommend this game to fairly young children or people with low tolerance for games like this one. Overall, Conker's Pocket Tales is a fun game. If you can overlook the frustrating parts, you will probably really enjoy this game!"
3,Mother from Italy,"My bright four year old son loved this game until he realized he could only manage half the tasks on the first level. Now it frustrates him to no end. He cannot move quickly enough for the sub-games. My husband and myself had a nearly impossible time with some of the sub-games. It is utterly frustrating. In addition, you get killed so easily it becomes boring waiting for the system to re-boot over and over. I found it annoying. Many times I was tempted to heave the thing across the room. No wonder my Dad told me to never play video games! The only benefit was IF you could get to the new worlds, they were fun to explore."
3,Hope you bought it used!,I find this to be an annoying but addictive game. The maps are barely any use and you don't get your own. Otherwise it's O.K. I just beat it and you get much of an ending. You most likely have to get everything just to get a good ending. I'd suggest spending money on somthing else.
3,Not as good as Bad Fur Day,"Conker is Awesome, yet in this game is where he was originally supposed to be like, A Kid Character, not a Swearing Wasted Guy (doesnt matter tho, hes awesome still),Anyway, Its kinda like Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge a little, well gameplay style anyway, the overview style gameplay type...err sorry if this isnt helping, Kinda getting twisted..., OK, The Game is Fun but If you play it for awhile it gives you kinda of a Headache though, so I would say about 30-50 min. tops,If your a conker Fan or a RAREWARE Fan, then this will be an Awesome addition to your collection"
2,not worth it,"Conker's pocket tales is a really bad game. I think rare made it just to do somthing. All the people in this game are giant upsidedown acorns that talk. An evil acorn steals your girl friend at your birthday and you have to rescue her collecting presents and other things on your way. This isn't a great game for little kids either, because there are some really dificult minigames i it. I can't beat them so I don't play it. Just look for somthing else. Like gb camera, zelda, or pkmn pinball"
4,"Great for kids, but parents beware of the N64 conker game",This game is great for all ages. But parents shouldn't be mistaken this game with the Nintendo 64 conker. It's not the same family-friendly game like this one. The N64 version is more for adults because of the M-rated. It's not the same cute little Conker.
1,Dont reccommend it,"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ok listen up. I realy do not like this game, that is why i want to review it. It has good graphics, and is funny at times, yet it is so impossible to beat the first level! I am 14 years old. I am a gameboy freak, I know this stuff. My cousin had gotten this game for his birthday. He is 6, and he to has problems with it. I do not recommend this game to children under 12. Anyone over 12 might understand it and use there braain power to figue these things out. (This game is mostly like a puzzle.)"
2,Too Confusing,This game was way too confusing for me. I think it would be recommended for people that can stand annoyance and stress. You can't even tell where your going and the signs that appear every 50 minutes don't help at all. I recommend you not to buy this. I think people should try to sell theirs and don't regret it.
5,The Treasure of Lost Canyon is good fun,"A rare item these days - a good family film that does not cast the boy as a hip know-it-all, nor does it try to promote misguided New-Age hogwash. Based on a Robert Louis Stevenson tale, The Treasure of Lost Canyon tells an easy to follow heartwarming Americana story set near the end of the 1800's. William Powell, not in his usual wise-cracking role, delivers a very believable performance as a ""good neighbor Sam' type. Rosemary DeCamp is, as always, delightful and (TV) Tommy Ivo is perfect as the abandoned boy. A much overlooked solid performer, Henry Hull, cast as the villain of the piece does full justice to his role. Although not an earth-shaking drama, The Treasure of Lost Canyon comfortably fills the bill as good family entertainment."
2,Dissapointed,a little disappointed . I have seen other Dr. Lam CD's and I don't think this oneis as instructive
4,TCA II,"The video is typical Paul Lam, methodical and carefully explained. Easy to follow. While he demonstrates all of the steps I have found it is always helpful to also engage in an organized class on T'ai Chi; I highly recommend this video as a supplement to training."
2,Not very sturdy,"I grate a lot of hard cheeses and I've had to replace the shaft several times due to breakage. The shaft and the cones are, in general, flimsy."
3,It's a festive Ringo!,"What can I say? It's Ringo Starr singing Christmas songs. That pretty much describes it. It's kind of fun. He puts a little oomph into some songs and gets into the rhythm and blues at other times. His ""Little Drummer Boy"" sounds like ""Back Off Boogaloo"" with bells. He does his own version of the rare Beatles Christmas song ""Christmas Time is Here Again."" Actually, I kind of like this one better than the very unique Fab Four original. Ringo sings like Ringo. He use bagpipes riffs from time to time. Some of the songs are originals and others are classics. It's a fun CD to put up your tree up by."
4,Come on CHRISTMAS!!! Christmas COME ON!,"The same tracks as the Christmas album Ringo released in 2001, called ""I Wanna Be Santa Claus"". COME ON CHRISTMAS is always our first song of the season; it never fails to unleash that gleeful childhood feeling. Even though we happen to be...ahem...pretty well aged children, we'd challenge ANYONE to resist!"
1,Terrible,"I received a cassette tape thinking I was getting a CD. There was no return information or telephone number to call. When I got it, it was just a re-taping of old audio notes of Hemmingway, not a audio of a book, as I wanted. It was worthless to me. I even had to go buy a cassette player to hear the junk. I will never buy anything from International Books again."
5,Wanted: Beginners Only!,"I've been programming for a few years and the pitch made to the intermediate programmer concerning tracing caught my interest.The books is a fun read, however if you have been programming for more than a semester or two don't bother buying it. Its justfor beginners.DD"
4,Basic Debugging in C++,This book demonstrates the most important and basic skill to debug C/C++ programming - Assertion and Tracing. I am almost beginner in software debugging area and this book helped me a lot. FOR BEGINNER ONLY!!!
5,Great books!,"If you are interested in biophysics and polymer, you should never miss it!It is as great as the lecture given by the authors."
4,Green Linnet Golden,Believe it or not I had many of this collection in my Celtic music library. Just going down the road introducing and reintroducing it to my son who's been listening to the music since he was a baby. Brilliant tracks and a few surprises. If youre a fan you might find it in your collection already and if not consider this the best of this label.
2,Only if you have really big ears,"When I read other reviews that suggested this device would be uncomfortable for people with small ears, I thought, ""I have normal to small ears. It shouldn't be a problem."" Well, I was wrong. Not only did it not fit in my ear, the over-the-ear holder was designed for someone with really large ears (like really old guy ears that you notice are about 4-5 inches long). This product is designed for large ears only."
2,Misleading disc. Only contains 1/2 of a new song.,"CD 2 of a 2-part set. Tracks are: 1. ""There Goes the Neighborhood"" (Radio Edit #1) 2. ""Straight To The Moon"" (Non-LP track) 3. ""My Favorite Mistake"" (Live).Although the disc reports ""Straight to the Moon"" as a non-LP track, it is actually the song ""Resucitation"" (only available on the UK and Japanese imports of ""Globe Sessions"") with different lyrics. The production differs ever so slightly, and ""Resucitation"" is by far the superior lyrical composition. However, ""Straight To The Moon"" is not entirely un-enjoyable and Sheryl's most devoted fans would no doubt need to add this to their collection.The live version of My Favorite Mistake is merely an acoustic version of the song. My advice would be to buy part 1 and leave this one alone unless you are a die-hard fan."
4,Not Straight to the Moon!,"This CD is not the version featuring ""Straight to the Moon"" . The non-album track here is the weird waltzy ""You Always Get You Way"". Some may find the song funny, but musically it is more or less a ""throwaway"".The title-track is great. Typical of the ""Globe Sessions"" album and a live-favourite.The acoustic live version of ""Hard to Make a Stand"" is fine bluesy track."
2,Not fun,"This game is not fun at all. Trying to jump and/or move from level to level is so frustrating that I put the game away and refuse to play it! Graphically, it is cute, but because controlling Gex is extremely difficult, I cannot recommend this game. Maybe it is better on PlayStation."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOORIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!,"stupidstupidstupidstupidstupid! this is one of the boringest, stupidest, unfun games i have ever played in my entire life. DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
3,"Almost a bad game, Almost a good game","I thought that this game had no plot whatsoever. But it is pretty challenging. The graphics are pretty good and Gex is a neat geco, but I think that the plot is one of the most important parts of the game. The enemies aren't too hard too kill but the codes to get to more levels are too complex and hard to record. The point of codes is so that someone who gets to a level can go back, but someone who hasn't been there can't--in this game you can't no matter what because the codes are very difficult to get right. Also, the whole point of the game is to get all of the TV screens, how stupid is that? But there are plenty of levels, and it is pretty hard, the graphics are pretty good, thats why I gave it a triple-star, but I thought that it had the one of the worst plots that I've seen in a game, but you might like it."
5,My dogs favorite treat,"Great treats and this large size was a really good buy! Since I have a bunch of dogs, it doesn't take them too long to go through these. They are a great size too!"
4,A Must book for historians - but dont' agree with conclusion,"A short note. A good book and a must read on the eastern front historian. I disagree with the thesis, but it seems correct that August 1941's decisions brought Axis closest to victory. Closest but not close enough as soviet matieral uncovered in the 90's show Russia would have fought on with the US. I believe the bigger victory in the East the Axis succeeded, the more likely it would have suffered catastrophic defeats like Moscow in 41 or Stalingrad in 42. But a good book to buy and read."
2,Monday Morning Quarterbacking,"The author's thesis is that the Germans could have won the war against the USSR if they had attacked for Moscow. This is what the German generals wanted to do, but Hitler thought he knew more than the professionals. Obviously a better strategy gives a better chance of success, but the main problems, the sheer size of the USSR, the number of men available to the Red Army as reinforcements, the Russian winter and massive Soviet industrial plant safe in the Urals would have remained.I would render the Scot's verdict: unproved."
1,Could have been better,A onesided revisionist view. Dont waste your time unless your just looking for entertainment.
5,Paydirt,"These gloves work really well dry but I'd suggest having a standard backup pair when playing in rainy conditions, as they don't grip at all when wet. Otherwise, a great price for a quality receiving glove."
5,Baldwin and Simon a winning pair,"Baldwin predominates in this one. Story still as well constructed as ever. More Medievel history with which Ellis Peters hooked me. Never considered myselfAnglephile but seem to be approaching. Jecks keeps his standards high. the Academic portion is somewhat a challenge at times, but worth it."
3,Reception increase not as i expected,"for the price i paid, it not bad but it didnt provide the recpetion increase i was looking for. it good for areas that already have recpetion and you just want a stronger signal. ohter than that...find other method."
3,Almost Like Being In Love,"Almost Like Being In Love is the unconventional love story, the nerd and the jock hook up and actually fall in love with each other, both boys by the way. The story is something that I was skeptical about at first, but once it traveled to their adult lives I began to take it more seriously. I feel as though Last Days of Summer is Kluger's best work, but Almost Like Being In Love uses his style of writing just as eloquently and allows for each side of the story to be told in an amusing way."
3,Middle of the Road,Predictable. Improbable. Funny. Full of cliche. The incessant baseball references were a bit over the top. I cried a little bit at the end but I'm taking Wellbutrin to quit smoking so you do the math.
5,Just charming--great format...,One of the things I enjoyed most was the crisp presentation and different modes of presentation.And the story was just charming--a real winner! Treat yourself.
2,fluffy tale,"Although cleverly put together, this novel was ultimately disappointing. Instead of constructing humor by subtly exaggerating human foibles and gently highlighting the absurdities of everyday life, the author coated his characters with a shallow silliness that made it impossible for me to care about them or what they did. I could not even see them as ""soap opera"" real. The plot also threw credulity to the wind at every turn. The book started out with promise but the further I read the more annoyed I became. I enjoy happy endings, but the quick wrap up was too much, or actually, too little. I got the impression the author became as tired of his characters as I did."
2,A Failure,"This novel fails on many grounds, especially with the caricaturing of liberal versus conservative political fighting throughout, with the climactic humiliation of Trent Lot near the end. See Angels in America for an example of a more masterful presentation of politics in a creative work. I agree with the reviewer who observes that the characters share the same wit, which awkwardly deforms the author's better attempts at developing his characters.The only part of the novel that feels genuine is the initial developing romance between Travis and Craig at boarding school, which I suspect is semi-autobiographical. I suggest that the author, who certainly has writing skill, draw more on his real experience to give us something worthwhile."
1,Old used book,"The book received was published in 2004, signed by the author and looked like it had been sitting in the sun since it was printed. The pages were yellowed and looked like it had already been read by someone. I could understand if this had been ordered from one of Amazon's discount dealers or used book sellers but this came directly from Amazon at full price. Very disappointing."
5,It's all About Love,"I re read this book after 5 years and it still makes me happy. What can I say,I'm a sucker for romance.This has it in spades and being a Broadway Baby, I love all the references to the theater.While this is a very good love story. The greatest love story I have EVER read is the love story between Joey Margolis and Steve Banks in Last Days of summer.I bet I've mailed 8 copies or so to friends for them to read.Steve Kluger is a winner!"
4,Almost Like Being In Love,This book is about the ups and downs of gay love. The author uses a lot of baseball terms thruout the book and I had a hard time understanding it until I caught on. This book has wonderful love stories in it.
5,Typical Steve Kluger,"Mr. Kluger has a unique talent for bringing humor, really clever humor, and brilliant dialogue to the page. His characters are always people, even the oddballs, who you want to have to dinner and on the last page of his books you invariably want to know more. However, I find that I am always satisfied and happy with the end."
5,Inspired,"Steve Kluger knows how to pull heartstrings while simultaneously stimulating the intellect. I am not one to rearrange my daily plans for a book, but after purchasing it on a friend's recommendation, I found myself glued to the couch and forgoing common things (like bathing) for the rest of the day as I was hunched over this book.The character development is a guidebook to the possibilities of the human heart. One would think that there are only so many trite ways for a writer to stage a high school romance, but this is fresh and novel.I'm heartily recommending this book to anyone in search of a gripping tale of love and adventure--but certainly not for anyone looking for the ""carefree romp"" of a Harlequin romance novel. Simply be warned: it is an emotional rollercoaster."
3,Over the top,"John Ritter aims high with his latest novel, which is more than can be said for most young adult fiction. He tries to meld baseball and coming of age, the mourning of war dead and a family melodrama, tragedy and triumph. He only sometimes succeeds. This book could have profited from a good editor. There's such a thing as trying to do too much in a novel, and by aiming at so many fences, Ritter hits precious few of them on the button. Case in point: he sets up a terrible family tragedy in the first few pages, one that should haunt our young protagonist through his coming of age. And yet, the author never comes back around to that which he has set up. Weird. For another thing, this is a 300 page book that could have been 200. Ritter can write, but needs to be more focused in his next effort."
5,Over the Wall by John H. Ritter,"""Over the Wall"" by John H. Ritter was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is about a boy named Tyler who has many conflicts with his family and his baseball team that he plays for. He has a mom and dad that he lives with in California, but the book takes place in New York where he visits his cousin Louie. He joins a baseball team there. Tyler has a very short temper which gets him in trouble quite a lot. At the end of the book he cleans up and tries out for the league All-Stars. Will he make them? Read the book to find out."
5,An Amazing Book for Teens OR Adults,"Wow--what a powerful story. I know that young adult literature has some of the best writing around these days, but the scope of this book really surprised me. It has so many different levels, and that is a mark of a truly talented author. This is not only a book about the love of baseball, it's about getting past the walls of anger than constrict us as individuals and as a nation. I defy someone to not identify in some way with 14-year-old Tyler, whether you are a baseball fan or not. The book is a bit lengthy, but like a 2-hour movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, you'll hardly notice the pages turning. Nice job, Mr. Ritter."
2,Poles Apart,"This book is many ways the opposite of one of Dworkin's critical feminist works. Whereas the latter are compelling, this is quite boring (in the sense of nothing new); where they are seamlessly convincing, this is self-conscious (like an exercise in good writing). Also, readers of the radical political texts, might be disturbed by the sensibility here--impersonal sex seems more often a cool thing, than a sexist thing, and there is a kind loudness or unconvinging extremeness in the reportage (Bennington is little more than a brothel and high school teachers are like gods). This is unfortunate, because it might make some readers (not this one, I don't think) question her feminist texts as overstated or too extreme."
4,Heartbreak,The book has an interesting insight into the heinous nature of man. She is an intellectual genius who has laid the foundation for women to exceed their own goals and continue to amaze.
1,What a cow of a book,"I'm an independent, and by our culture's definition- sexy- young woman who has suffered my share of adversity, depression, addiction -you name it. I'm also a Harvard-educated feminist intellectual and I find nothing to share in common with this beast of a woman or this beast of a book. What is the deal, here? I can't help but feel if Dworkin had been born ""pretty' she wouldn't have such a chip on her shoulder. As if we can't see through that! Give me a break. I'd give this book zero stars if I could."
1,Terrible,"This has to be one of the worst books ever written. I had a terrible time following the plot of the story as the book jumped around and bored the reader with uninteresting conversation as way too much description of unimportant objects. I had to force myself to read it and did not finish it. Supposedly, the novel is full of symbolism, yet I can find little to none of that. Perhaps the translation is off. Or maybe the book itself is over-emphasized as a great novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,not what you expect,"Well, first off, this book contains the VOCAL SELECTIONS, not the script. The blurb is a bit misleading, but if you look closely at the cover photo you can sort of make-out ""Vocal Selections"" at the top. As with many vocal selection books, many of the songs have been transposed. The choice of selections are pretty good, but there are some misleading statements on the table of contents page (such as title changes) which do not coincide with the CD recording. Since the CD was recorded after the production closed, it's possible that the vocal selections came out while the show was still running, and therefore the contents page explains changes from the original production. However, since that production is long gone, and all we have left is the cd, perhaps a re-print is in order??? I was hoping for a story synopsis or photos from the Broadway production, but they are non-existant. Hopefully this review will at least clarify some of my own questions prior to purchase."
1,i-pen : DO NOT BUY,This is the worst purchase I have ever made in tech gadgets....even 2 dollar mouses wired ones are better!!!!Do not waste your money!! And I ordered it half way across the world!!
1,Horrible!,My friend bought me this CD because I like this type of Music but this was a disgrace!Thank God their not famous!
4,An unique racing,"While there are lots of Formula-One racing version in Playstations, etc...this game is as exciting as the other versions. You can choose the country you wanna race in, the variety of players/racers, and some are big stars in F1. You can train first (short race) and then compete against the computer racer. Defenitely a fun game!"
4,A moderate racer,"Offically licensed to drive with F-1 cars and drivers, FormulaOne 2k burns rubber all over the globe, taking you up to Monaco,Montreal,Indanapolis and other pit stops on the worldwide racing circuit. Take 2's day at the races rolls out the sim gmeplay,allowing you to retool your car to your liking. In the garage, you can adjust your rides gear ratio,tires,and fuel cpacity. On the road, you must deal with rival drivers, weather condiitions and twists and turns that could send your car into a spinout. Aimed to please F-1 fans, Formula One 2k provides user-friendly ride that casual race fans can enjoy."
2,A color version of F1 Race,"I bought this game just after I bought Test Drive Le Mans (4 Stars). The difference between these two games is night and day. If you've ever played the old Game Boy game F1 Race, this just seems to be a color update. Sure, you get all the F1 tracks and drivers and you can tune the cars for the tracks, but the game play and graphics are just old-style Game Boy. All the tracks look alike, they are all flat with little scenery. Boring!! Save your $ and get Test Drive Le Mans."
3,Came up short,"This is a fun toy for a child just learning to stand, but once they are a little bigger, this is just too short for them to use. It also seems top heavy and tips over easily."
2,Be carefull,"I got the cube in 2008 at that time my kid was 13 months old. He played with it for a bit. The cube was in the living room area ...where he was playing all the time. He fall on it and got injured. He has a scar on his forehead. This afternoon...my little one, 21 months, was playing again around that cube and fall...hit his face on it and has a big bruise on his face......"
2,good but damaged,my son love this at once he saw and he liked it very much to play.but we found many cracks in the wood and i thought it is not really safety.woods are chirping and paint is peeling off.otherwise it is really good one for kids.i returned the product today and planning to get another one.
4,"Great product, but watch those fingers!","This is a really fun product for my son; the only problem I have with it is the placement of the alphabet squares on the one side. These are placed so that if a little finger pushes in far enough on the top or bottom at the ""unlucky"" angle, then pulls back, the squares can actually trap the finger and smash it a bit. I only had to help my son get his finger out once, but I tried it after that, and it trapped my finger just as easily. Other than that, again, it's a really fun kid-occupying toy."
3,"Child loves it, but it's very poorly constructed","After reading the other reviews about peeling paint, I was hesitant to buy this, but gave it a try anyway. Right out of the box I noticed chipped paint and areas that had been touched up with somewhat mismatched dabs of paint. Globs of glue were noticed around the ""zoo"" structures on top of the box. I don't think this will look good for long, as it already looks worn and well-loved - even though I've had it less than a week. I can say that my 9 month old absolutely LOVES it (I know, I know, much younger than the recommended age, but she plays with it supervised). 3rd party sellers are selling this for way too much - you can find it in the store at Target for 49.99."
3,HOW MUCH????,"My mother bought this at BJ's for $39.99!!! The same EXACT one!!! My 7 month old loves it, and so does my 3&1/2 year old son. But I would not have paid over 100 buck for it!!! Is this the correct price???It IS a great toy though!!!"
1,Dangerous Edges,"I bought this product for my 12 mos. old. He absolutely loved it, but when he tripped on the rug, and hit his forehead on the top edge we realized that not all of the edges are rounded. The top edge of this toy is sharp, and split his forehead open. We had to make a trip to the ER, and my son now has a scar on his beautiful forehead! I'm so upset!"
1,Hazardous,"I have been eyeing this toy for months and finally got it for my now 10 month old daughter. First thing she did is reach up, grab the wire loops and tug. The toy, although somewhat hefty, lifted off the floor a bit. That was a bad omen to me. Second tug, the thing tipped all the way over, my daughter fell onto her back and the toy came down on top of her. She wasn't hurt, but it's clear that it is not safe for her to play with it unless she's under strict supervision. I'm returning it immediately."
4,Beautiful Wooden Toy,Our daughter loves this toy and I think we will get many years out of it. Our block is beautiful - no peeling paint. It also seems well made. The block does tend to tip a little bit when our daughter pulls up.
4,Looks nice,"This Activity center looks prety nice, has a lot of entertaining pieces.But after 1 week of use it cracked on the top. It's not a big deal for now, but I'm wonderuing if it will remain with this one shake only.My one year old twin boys are not so exalted about this toy, as I expected, but I hope in few weeks they will play more with it."
3,Cute but not well made,"I received this as a gift for my 7 month old son. We had to send the first one back because it had been damaged and someone did a lousy job of repainting the damaged area. The second one has lots of little flaws - poorly painted in areas, painted over tape, crooked parts. Overall, I do like it, but I wish it was better made."
2,Too expensive compare to Zany zoo from B!,We just bought exactly similar cube from Target (manufactured by company called B) and it is just for $50 ! It is very good quality and my 11 months old really like it. I could not understand why it is so expensive here! I would recommend people to go and check zany zoo on target website. ([...]).
1,Hands and fingers trapped in two of the sides,"I bought the Busy Zoo at Target and my then twelve-month old twins liked it very much, although it did not take my son long to learn to tip it over and reach inside the hollow underside. After a month, however, both my babies started getting their hands and/or fingers trapped and pinched in the two sides with spinning wood blocks. They would cry and could not get their hands and fingers out without my help. I did not, however, have peeling paint, as others have. I took the Busy Zoo away, of course. Interesting that the description for the product reads for one-year olds, but there is a warning for choking hazards on the Amazon page, stating not for children under three."
1,absolutely uncomfortable,"When I got these for my daughter, I was shocked at how rough they were. She really likes Thomas, so I kept them for a while. Yet now that we've had them for a time, even she- at 2 1/2 yrs old- says they are scratchy. They are at the bottom of our sheet rotation and ONLY used when absolutely everything else is dirty. I plan on making some sort of wall hanging craft out of them soon."
1,"Cute Set, Very Cheaply Made & Very Rough","I was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son, but when I took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper. I have washed it several times but it is still very rough. Also the first time I washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed. It was very cheaply made, but my son does love it, purely because its Thomas I'm sure. I wouldn't buy this again!"
1,BEAUTIFUL PRINTS OF THOMAS & FRIENDS BUT MATERIAL SANDPAPER!!,the fitted twin sheet when I used in my boy bed on corner to rip.....is the worse material use for childrens is SANDPAPER .The worse product...the only good thing is that my little sleep better with thomas and friends.I recommend thi sproduct only if your boy is not easy to put it in bed....with thomas can sleep without mom or dad.
1,NO SHOW,"I DID NOT RECEIVE IT AND NEVER HEARD WHY DESPITE REPEATED ""WHERE'S MY STUFF"" SEARCHES AND INQUIRIES, WHICH WERE IGNORED!"
5,Not for the squeamish,"A fast-paced, terrifying thriller with richly developed characters, suspenseful plot twists and vivid imagery. The supernatural elements add another layer to the story and set the stage for an intriguing twist at the end."
4,Loony Tunes Booms!,"Hi! I got this game for my 10th or 11th b-day and I am still playing it non-stop! I definitely got my money's worth out of it ! If you are considering buying it, I encourage you to!!!!! The levels are all really fun, and the difficulty is just right for any gamer! Hope you enjoy it, because it is definitely worth the price I paid!!! It is better than any game I ever played on my gameboy color! The graphics are excellent and you have a chance to be any character you want. It's great for any age, because the levels get harder as they increase, that way, you are getting a bit better every level. Wow! I still cant believe what a great buy this was! I love this game!!!"
1,LOONEY TUNES CARROT CRAZ,"I was very disappointed as the item I had ordered,Carrot Craz, was not shipped due to an error at hitmenow.com. Now it seems I cannot get the item at the usual low price as a used item. This was a Valentine Gift I had been looking for over the last 3 months and was happy to finally find it. Thank you for the opportunity to express my concern. Deborah Marsili"
4,Best game ever,Great game must have. If you have a gameboy you have not played a good game untill you have played this game. Two thumbs up! 6 out of 5 stars! Very very cheep price for how fun this game really is. I love the graphics of this game. Need for speed underground is awesome. The need for speed games are all fun. One more fun need for speed game is Porsche unleashed. That game is also available for gameboy advanced.
4,"really good ,dogg",the need for speed game is really good dogg! at least dat what i heard.for 2 whole months i wanted to rent it but they never had it.you see i have a GBA and a PS2. i really wanted it but my parents said wait until christmas and it almost is.but now dat i have it for GBA i am very very very very happy.it is exactly like the xbox cause my friend has it. it is a really godd game and it has over 100 kinds of items for your car!!!!!!!!!
2,"Very cheap, poor quality","I've had my cat for four years now, and I've almost always fed her Meow Mix because its inexpensive, and its what my family used to buy to feed her and other cats we've had in the past. Since she seemed to favor it, I continued to feed it to her after I had moved out of the house, taking her along with me. Although I'd clean up her messes before, she tends to vomit almost all the time (or maybe I just notice it more?)What I've come to realize that she vomits up this food at least once or twice a month. Once I did some research on cat nutrition, and then looked at the ingredients in this food, its really not what you want your cat to be eating...I know it'll be more expensive, but I'd rather give my cat something that she can digest and enjoy, with quality, than give her something cheap that makes her sick."
1,Don't feed your cat this trash,"Meow Mix is one of the cheapest brands of cat food widely sold in supermarkets and convenient stores. Unfortunately, it's trash; mostly low-grade corn and soy with some chicken byproduct meal and beef tallow (low grade fat) for flavoring. It's cheap for a reason.My sweet cat that I just brought home from the shelter was raised by her previous owner on Meow Mix. She sheds like crazy, which should resolve now that she's receiving real food."
1,Poor,I bought this when I got my first cat because I didn't know any better. He shedded like crazy. Someone told me it was because Meow Mix is such a poor quality/grade of food. I switched to Iams and he stopped shedding almost overnight. I will never go back to Meow Mix.
1,Broke within a week,"Although the AC Adapter still works, the wires were exposed through the plastic after only a week. Furthermore, many times after I plug it into my computer, the screen flashes meaning that the adapter is not constantly charging my computer."
1,DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT Under any circumstances!!!!!!,"Bought this item directly from Amazon. It stopped working 1 week after the 30 day return period was up. Only functioned for 5 weeks!! Amazon REFUSED to even exchange it! Said I had to contact the manufacturer.( What a hassle!) I usually love Amazon, but this time I am disgusted with this product. SAVE YOUR MONEY! Do not buy this!Update: Amazon sent a replacement after manufacturer couldn't help.Guess what? It was the same exact product. Right out of the box, it didn't work either!! I bought another cord elsewhere. It works perfectly, so it is not my battery or the computer! Again, DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,My cord died.,I received this item about March 10th and the item decided to die on April 28th. I am extremely upset. Please do not waste your money!!!!!
4,"no complaints, a bit pricey though","I bought this adapter and cord for my HP Omnibook Xe3. I suppose it's kinda hard to review a power cord other than saying ""it works."" The adapter detaches from the power cord, which makes it easier to wrap up when traveling. All in all, a good piece of equipment, though it can get pretty hot sometimes. It's difficult to find the power adapter you need for your specific model because there's so many of them, so if you need this one, I would recommend buying this because you're not likely to find one anywhere else, including the HP website. Replacement parts for old computers are going to be expensive no matter where you look."
1,Not equivalent,"This claims to be equivalent to LSE9802A2060, but it isn't. The AC plug that goes into the computer has a slightly smaller diameter than the LSE9802A2060 and doesn't make snug contact. While I was using it recently, it jiggled at an inopportune time, causing a power interruption during a critical disk access, and now I can't boot anymore."
4,"Works perfectly, and the shipping was wicked fast","There is not much to say about something without any other use than to charge your Compaq computer.Works perfectly.That being said, this product shipped to me in less than five days via USPS normal mail, and the charger works perfectly.I also really appreciate this vendor's willingness to ship with as many options and locations as possible.The price is also well below what about anyplace else wants for an equivalent adapter.How often have customers been turned away, told by a vendor that they will not ship to a P.O. Box, or via UPS/FedEx only?"
4,Almost but not quite the same as the original adapter,"The adapter works great but I had to make a modification to keep the adapter inserted into the printer. It previously kept falling out because the diameter of the adapter end is smaller than the original adapter. So even though it says equivalent, I would say almost, but it's not quite the same as the original adapter."
4,Good quality replacement power adaper,"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the adapter piece and connection are very easily disconnected. I find the adapter in the laptop, while the other end is on the floor because it fell out.It only falls out if it is tugged out... it just doesn't magically fall out. ( I abuse my products, that is why I needed a new one :) So far so good as it is handling my needs.This works on my IBUYPOWER Slim series notebook."
3,Slow aquiring satellites,"I purchased this is for my Samsung Blackjack because at that time I could not find a GPS software that works on it. The package comes with Garmin Mobile XT and the maps. I found that it is extremely slow acquiring satellite signals. I have TomTom on my Dell Axim and a Holux GPS, they are much faster at picking up the satellites.When I paired it with TomTom, it seems to picked the satellites a little faster - may be it's just the Garmin Mobile XT software. Also on TomTom it's always seems to be a street off.I would avoid this product. There are many better generic bluetooth GPS out there that can paired with other better GPS software."
4,GPS,Easy set up. One needs to learn the meaning of the words used for the direction given in advance before going through a big city such as ramp left and keep left.
4,How did I find my way without it!!!,"For a mobile salesperson that would like to use it with their laptop, pda or smart phone, excellent device. Range is a bit suspect as well as the laptop software. The software for the pda or smart phone is excellent. Mutliple via point sorting available on the pda/smartphone version only."
4,Mobile Bluetooth,"Everyone with a laptop should purchase the Mobile 10 vs. the self-contained GPS system. Using the laptop, you have a much larger screen to view the maps and you can type the addresses/routes with the keyboard...a big timesaver. You can also upload addresses from other map programs like google maps. The main problem is that the program that comes with it is not super user friendly -- it's not bad, just not great. Otherwise it's great. Apparently you can also use it with a phone or PDA, making it more portable. The unit itself is unbelievably small...it actually looks bigger in the picture but it's like half the size of a deck of cards. Also, keep in mind you need a bluetooth device to use it as there are no cables to connect it with the computer. I'd recommend it if you travel a lot with your laptop, not so much if you don't have one."
5,Garmin Mobile 10 Receiver,This little unit is neat. Not to mention its battery life. I found out that the easiest way for it to pair with my HTC 8525 running Garmin XT was to power up the mobile 10 then activate the XT software other wise it took too long to find the receiver. The only other thing i wish it had was an optional external port.
2,Palm users beware,"I am very disappointed in the Palm implementation. MANY MANY Repeated soft-resets, no ability to view tracks or create tracks on my Lifedrive. No way to quickly return to the ""home"" screen when forced to go deep into the menus. I'm a very experienced Palm user and keep a very tight lid on applications and never add hacks to my unit. Two contacts with Garmin support recommended I get a different unit at 2-3 times the price. Thanks a lot Garmin. I'm wondering if there is a case for false advertising?"
1,Garmin Mobile 10 Bluetooth GPS,"Month later, still not installed properly. BT only. USB to communicate/charge with PC but does not function as GPS. Will not install to phone, must install to SD card and install. Having compatibility issues with SD card from PC to phone. Wasted a lot of time."
1,This product is no longer supported by garmin,"Don't waste your time or money, the Mobile 10 is no longer supported by Garmin."
4,Garmin Bluetooth Navigation for Smartphone,"The Garmin 10x links up easily to the Motorola Q and provides turn-by-turn directions. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Garmin OnLine works seamlessly with the 10x software, giving traffic alerts as well as sorting gas prices for refueling. My only criticism has more to do with the Motorola Q when used as an in vehicle navigator. The battery runs down much too quickly and must be used with a DC adapter. The 10x also works with my notebook PC, but the software is dated and not easy to use."
5,worked fine on Nokia E51,"I used this GPS on the northwest of Argentina, in cities and open spaces and worked very well. The Nokia E51 is based on the Symbian operating system. The software could be improved, but worked well enough to navigate. The GPS unit, once it gets the satellites, can continue getting its position in the streets. I never expected to continue to get my position in such difficult conditions. As being separate from the phone, it has the advantage of being able to be placed on the windshields where it can get the satellites signal, and the disadvantage of being easy to forget it. The battery worked fine (as new)."
1,Shame on Amazon,I will never use Amazon again. We tried and tried to get a hold of you to return this item but you did not respond and no directions for returning items. I even had my assistant try and she could not get through and then we get an email after the 30 day return policy.How sly is that. You have a customer.Colleen AsmussenCell 608-235-1300
4,"A Different Time, A Different Place","""An Irishman should never be trusted."" That had been drummed into Georgina all her life by her mother and her grandmother before her- and Georgina had never had any reason to doublt the truth of it.So what was she doing, getting engaged to Lian Ardulian, Chief of the whole Irish clan of Ardulians?A different time, a different place ... I guess that's what fascinates me about these old Harlequin romances. Written and published in the early 70s, the way the characters dress, their relationships, their habits - the drinking, the smoking - just seems foreign: my parents' generation. This one has twists and turns and some quirky characters that really made it special."
4,I though this book was ok.,"This was alright I though it shows the truth about money. But i think it would be better for the younger group of kids, like 3-5 year olds."
5,Christmas CD,I heard this cd at a Christmas party and loved it. I could not find it in local stores. I was happy to find in on Amazon and the price was great.
4,Temptaions where tempting,"Great Collection for any temptaions fan. How ever some of the song where often heard on other collectors cds. Only a few of the songs weren't played to death on other albums. Also i loved the extra track ""Oh Holy Night "" i never haerd that song sung quit like that before. I found it very refreshing."
5,Great CD,I love it when my order arrives on time. The temptation Christmas songs are classic and hard to find. The price was a little high but you get what you pay for. I will hold on to this for many years. It makes for wonderful holiday music.
4,Classic Christmas songs,Some of these songs I remembered from my early childhood days at Christmas time and my family loves this CD.
3,beautiful book,So nice and sensual photographs !I recommend this book for everyone who likes sexy and attractive male-body.It's a good idea that each family has the book in the living room to foster a sense of beauty and educate the child(ren) aesthetics .
5,"""I hear it in the deep heart's core""","Heart of the Gaels is an excellent sampler from the respected Green Linnet label, home to artists such as Altan, Capercaillie, Andy M. Stewart, John Cunningham, Sileas, the Tannahill Weavers, Jerry O'Sullivan, and Patrick Street, to name a few. Heart of the Gaels presents the listener to some of today's most exciting Celtic acts. Four different Celtic heritages (Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, and Galicia) are represented. There are musical styles to suit everyone: reels, jigs, slow airs, and vocal acrobatics with songs such as Puirt-a-Beul. Prefer instrumentals? Fear not! There are blazing fiddles, rollicking accordions, soulful tin whistles, bouncing bodhrán beats, Uilleann pipes, and guitars galore! This album has something for everyone and is guaranteed to make your toes tap! Enjoy!"
1,The Wallcrawler crawls up my wall,"I truly believe that this naff sequel tries to be annoying and repulsive. The camera angles would make Spidey spit out his web in discust. The gameplay would be great if itad a totally different plot all together and didn't invole Spiderman at all.This is truly a triumph in the 1 star section, but next time make it an '18' so I won't have to endure the boring piece of crap that it is!!!"
5,TIGHT GAME BABY,"I'VE GOTTEN TO CHAPTER 17 USING THE ""HCRAYERT"" CODE AFTER GETTING 50000 HERO POINTS I THINK ON CHAPTER 17 YOU HAVE TO GET ALL OF THE AWARDS BUT... I SAID I THINK, SO DON'T GO STRAIN YOURSELF AND FINISH EVERYHING AND GET PISSED AND SEND BULLCRAP MAIL TO ME SAYING THATS A LIE.ANYWAY MYSTERIO I COULD'NT BEAT SO I PUT THE CODE ""HCRAYERT"" CODE IN SO NOW I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF THERE IS MORE THAN 17 CHAPTERS AND HOW DO I GET TO THEM AND IF YOU CAN BEAT THE GAME AND GET NEW CIVILIAN MISSIONS AND CHALLENGES."
3,No No No,"This game is so weak. The graphics suck. You got to be mad if you buy this game and the cars are all boxy and stuff. The buildings are really bad too. If you have played DRIVER 2 for PS1, thats what the buildings look like. This game is fun for like 15 minutes and dont get me started on the voices in this game. MJ's voice is really badly done. The only that sounds right is Peter Parker and that's only because he is the star. But anyways you can still tell thats not his voice. This game shoulda been like 35 dollars."
3,Boring and Lame,"I love Spidey, but this game really disappoints, unlike the first one you don't really fight anyone here, except Doc. You have to do over and over and over like 50 times each the same ""clumsy"" missions: catch a flying balloon, kick robbers behind, and delievering pizzas, it gets boring, the real mission are as lame as they can get. The ""last"" mission against Doc Ock is very tough, but not because its hard, but because the controls are not as responsive as you wish they were.Rent it."
5,Grand Theft Spider,"This is a GREAT, GREAT game. As opposed to the last Spiderman game, this one is totally open ended: You can roam over a (somewhat less than full scale) map of Manhattan, stopping random crimes and accepting challenges on your way to starting the next 'mission' in advancing the story line. The controls take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of the new web-swinging you'll be zipping around, climbing to the top (and I mean the top) of the Empire State building, and doing power dives off, only to spin another line at the last minute, knocking out the bad guys in mid flight then hanging their webbed bodies from a lamp post. You can do it all in this game."
5,Spidey's Antics,"If you ever wanted to feel like what it was like in Spiderman's shoes, Spiderman 2 by Activevision is one of the closest experiences you'll ever have. Following the plot of the movie fairly closely, with a couple of irritating detours, you get to swing from the buildings in a virtual New York that's expansive and fun. The thing that impressed me the most was having total control of Spiderman, and if a challenge proved to be too pesky, I could restart that chapter from the beginning and swing around town until I went back to the challenge. If I earned points for everytime I went to the top of the Empire State Building and swan dived off from it, I'd have won the game earlier. Kudos to the Activevision people for making a truly enjoyable romp!"
5,awsome game,i know i shouldn't be saying this is a five star game without playing it but i loved the first one and the second one looks 10 times better and im not exagerating.
4,Spider-Man better than ever!,"I think this game is going to be the best ever.Get ready to faceoff Dr.Octopus,Lizard,and Mysterio.In this game you get to face offthose guys and other crinamals walking the streets.You get to wrap up more than one thug or bad guy in a single shot of web!In the original game you could only wrap one bad guy in a shot of web.You can swing up on top of the Statue of Liberty!Well that's what I heard.I defintly reccomend this game.I can't wait untill it comes out!"
4,gotta get spiderman 2,"evey one knows that spider man 2 is going to be the best game ever, YOU GET GO ON THE GROUND, HOW COOL IS THAT, SIMILAR TO GRAND THEFT AUTO BUT YOU CAN SWING AND CLIMB AROUNDEVERYONE MUST VORCE THERE PARENTS TO GET THIS GAME NO MATTER WHAT OR EARN MONEY, JUST ONE MORE DAY"
3,"Boss level redundent and tedious, but rest is fun","This game is fun up until you have to complete the Bugle moving platform game. It is a series of moving platforms, some of which you can grab, and others you can't. The only way to find out is through trial and error and it's very very tedious(also, you constantly battle with the always changing camera angle which is very annoying). If you fall off, you have to start all over. There is nothing really fun about this. But I can spend hours and hours on the petty crimes and other happenings around the city just because the graphics are fluid and they are fun to play. Kind of like a grand theft auto environment but you get to be spidey."
5,Spiderman 2 rocks,"Spiderman 2 is one of the best action games i ever played.It has a great storyline that is definetly entertaining.I found only 3 minor flaws to the game: 1) the graphics are not as good as spiderman 1.2) there are some glitches and my game froze once in a while.3) there is no main menu , you just have to go straight to the story.The GREAT features of the game: 1) u can go in the streets of NY City2) you dont HAVE to follow the story line3) many hidden places4) you can buy upgrades and health5) help citizens and grow in rank6) some difficult things that challenges u7) sorry but i had to add: FLYING OFF BUILDINGSOverall i gave this game 5 stars because i really enjoyed it, and if u dnt use walkthroughs it can be sort of challenging.DEFINEITLY BUT THIS GAME!!!!!!!:D"
2,Don't buy Spider-Man 2!!,"I didn't like this game at ALL. I rented it just now, and it sucks!! It's to short.So don't waste your money on it!!"
1,spiderman2 = Bad True Crime ?!?,"I played the demo my friend gave me - he works for Treyarch. I think the game is bad. AI doesn't know where to go , camera os choppy graphics - washed color. is ok to rent , but NOT A BUY"
3,How bad do u poeple want this game?,Well yes this sounds like a good game to buy.In the first 1 u have to web the gobbullins teeth.In this 1 u have to fight new bad guys.So i think u have to stell the costume & the mask in this 1.After i beat it i might sell it.
4,So Close....and YET!!!,"I was really eager to get my controls on this one.. and There are several improvements over the first one...like the ability to walk on the streets HA !! It is a little repetitive with the missions.. but I do enjoy playin it..Let me say I am yet to get to the %100 but I have beaten the Doc, not that easy...but on my way to more goodies i hope.So far I am a somewhat disappointed, it has so much potential and hopefully I can return to report that my satisfaction has improved... I was blown away by the first one and this one is filled with promise...over all enjoyable with hopefully lots more extras that I simply have not found yet...I will be fair and let you all know If I am more pleased @ 100% and beyond.P."
5,This Will Be A Game That Tops All Superhero Games,As from the details already given about this game i think that it will be the best superhero game to ever come out EVER!!!! i mean you can take advantage of the environment and swing whever whenever you want and that isnt the limits you don't have to follow levels its free roam like GTA Vice City so take it easy and do the missions whenever you want this will sure be an awesome game and i can't wait to get it also the web swinging movements look soo great this is going to be a great game a must buy
4,and watch the flaws melt away... (4.2/5),"when I plopped this game into my cousins PS2, I was excited, but also nervous about all the bad things I had heard. WEll, I did notice these bad things, the graphics, tho some nice touches (changing window light on the building, and Spidey's fluid movments) were generally sub-par (tho some of the boss characters look good, especially black_cat!) and yes there were a limited number of street crimes, and the game was too short, and a mite on the easy side. I took a jump of the tallest building in manhatten, swung from one end of the city to the other, and broguth back a little tykes balloon. Then I didn't notice the flaws anymore. All I saw was the fun, engaging, and highly entertaining game that SPiderman 2 is. SO do yourself a favour and RENT THIS GAME. (don't buy it tho, its too short unless your a rich fan.)"
3,Fun...but repetitive and easy,"Fun game...but after a while, it's the same thing over and over again...save people hanging on ledges, stop car robberies, and beat up gang members. It's fun...but more of a rental game...you can finish the game in a day."
3,Not that great.,"Although, very fun, it has many flaws. At first it seems to be great, but about halfway through glitches pop up everywhere (my disc has no scratches on it)! And why couldn't Actvision make the mouths move? But, worst of all, the fire graphics are horrible! It is still fun exploring New York though."
3,"Grand Theft Auto III, Reloaded.","It has its good (which are many) and some bad.Pros:Gives a lot of Spiderman control and actions.Web slinging through the streets of New York is a blast.Being able to side track into defeating normal criminals is so much fun it is easy to forget about the plot.It is a lot of fun.Cons:Graphics engine is very weak, just like in GTA3.Feet disappear into the ground, unable to walk over texture changes in the ground at random intervals.Pass through buildings, cars, etc...Most of the flaws can definitely be overlooked, and was probably released a little too soon. The flaws get frustratingly bad when your feet need to be on solid ground during some of the trickier boss battles.I have had a lot of fun with this game, just the final battle with Doc Oct is more a battle with the graphics engine more than the villain himself.But! The journey to get to that point is a lot of fun."
4,SPIDER-MAN DOES WHATEVER A SPIDER CAN,OK I just got the game today played with it about 7 hours total. All I can say is wow!taking a bite of the Big Apple Spidy style and there are no load times in-between toSlow down the feeling of swing from rooftop to rooftop. Even with the guide some ofThe buildings take forever to find. Just like GTA VC you can spend hours just swing around town literally.Much better overall from the first one.
4,Lots of fun.,The game more fun than the last. Its fun being able to walk on the streets and not to be afraid to die when you get to close. Spiderman has some really cool moves. The controls are challenging at first. I broke the L2 button from playing the game on my controller. Finding the places to buy new abilities i had a hard time with and there didn't seem like that many to buy. I met two of the graphic designers and they were proud of the game and they also loved playing.
5,Exactly What I Needed,"I've used this carrier on Southwest without any problems. My dog is an 8-9 lb. chihuahua and fits in it just fine with room to stand up and turn around. I don't have any issues carrying the carrier with her in it. I actually skip the shoulder strap (easily removable via clips) and use the handles as the straps. It's easier for me to carry the bag with her in it this way. Southwest dimensions are slightly smaller than this bag, but no one questioned us about the size of our carrier when we checked in. The frame is flexible enough to squish down a bit to fit under the seat without collapsing the entire bag onto my dog. It still held its shape. I've also used the carrier to take her on the bus and trains without any problems. I foresee using this carrier many more times!"
3,Ok except upper zippers stick,"The upper zippers stick, otherwise it is fine. 2 handy storage pockets. Convenient to use. Has nice liner andsome shades that roll up."
5,Great Pet Carrier,Item is as described. It's made sturdy and of durable materials. My dog is 12 pounds and it's just the right size for her to turn around in as required by most airlines. I expect this item to last a long time.
1,TOO LARGE FOR US AIRWAYS!,"Do NOT buy this product if you are flying USAirways.Their regulations are 10.5"" high and this is 11"" even tho it is advertised as 10.5"". You may get lucky with your airline or your particular airport--and they may let it slide by--but if you are not lucky, this could be extremely problematic for you.Other than wrong dimensions, it's a very fine product!ADDENDUM: After someone rated my review as ""not helpful"" I thought it might be useful for readers to understand that I was advised by USAirways itself--after I bought this carrier and phoned USAIRways--NOT to take a chance on a pet carrier that is not EXACTLY the dimensions they prescribe, or smaller. As they said, the sizes of planes vary a great deal these days, and it is possible you would NOT be allowed to take this carrier aboard when you showed up at the airport with your pet."
1,Does NOT meet airline standards,"19""L x 14""W x 8.25""H is the measurements straight off the Southwest website. This is for window and isle seats. Middle Seat: 19""L x 19""W x 8.25""H. I don't know how they can make the false claim that this is airline approved."
1,Great Pet carrier bag (Sherpa Pet Delta Deluxe Pet Carrier),"This bag is great. my dog loves it I carry her everywhere I go and she is so comfortable in there, I love the flaps that roll up that lets my dog see what is happening around them so she feels part of the actionGreat product"
4,Good product,"I liked this bag and its quality but it was a little smaller than I anticipated. I was worried my 15lb. shih tzu wouldnt fit in it. She did fit into the bag but couldnt really stand up all the way. I opened up the top zipper so she could poke her head out while we were walking around terminal and traveling on shuttles. She didnt like the bag at first because it was kind of on the small side but on our second flight home she got right in without me having to force her in. Overall, its a great product, great quality and price. We also didnt have any issues with the airlines telling us it was too big for under the seat. No one really knew a dog was in it unless her head was poked out."
5,Fits under Seat of US Airways,"Surprising how difficult it is to find a pet carrier that indicates that it will fit under seat on airline.I elected to go first class with the dog first trip just cuz. Carrier fits nicely under middle section in first class on Boeing 737. US Airways flight. Looking at space under seats in coach, looks like it is going to work as well.Good carrier, appears well built, Has the standard velcro strap on side (like a pc case)so it sits nicely on-top of standard roller bag we all pull around the airports.Lastly there is great access to pet from end and top."
5,Delta Carrier (Medium)Fits under the seat on Virgin America Planes,"Size is Approved on Virgin America planes-I ordered this for a direct flight from Washington DC to San Fran on Virgin America. It is well constructed, and easily fit under the seat in front of me on my flight. My dog is a Bichon Frise and weighs about 13 lbs."
2,Not Recommended for cats,"I had a very similar Sherpa brand carrier that I used for flying with my cat. The second time I took him on a trip he got spooked by some loud noises (military planes flying low overhead before take off) and managed to claw and bite his way through one of the mesh panels on the side of the carrier and escape. I grabbed the cat but I had to ask the steward for some duct tape to tape up the carrier. Luckily the guy sitting next to me was very understanding!This carrier may be fine for dogs or ""less determined"" cats."
4,Perfect for my Pup!,"I purchased this carrier to bring my puppy home from the breeder on a flight. It was convenient and easy to use. I was concerned that it wouldn't fit under the seat in the airplane, but it fit perfectly. The back corner of the bag squished down enough to fit under, while the front was at my feet. My 8lb puppy was comfortable and had enough room to move around. He was more tall than he was heavy and he was able to stand up in the bag. I was very happy with the Sherpa carrier."
5,an awesome pet carrier,"Our dog flew with us recently for the first time. She is a 3 year old Boston Terrier weighing approximately 10-12 pounds. Once we got her used to the carrier, it was a blessing. The shoulder strap and handles made it easy to carry. It is very well ventillated and very sturdy in comparison to others we have seen. The only problem is that it did not quite fit under the seat ahead of us on the plane. I believe it would have in first class, but not in economy, so we had to straddle the carrier during the flight. Because of the multiple zippered openings (top and front side), we were able to pet her during the flight."
2,Horrible zippers,"This bag provided lots of room and was great for the 2 plane trips we took our dog on. Fits perfectly under the seat, so you can hand carry your small pet. However, the zipper broke and we were not able to avail of the 1 year warranty. The bag also takes up a lot of storage space. Not worth the price, since it will break down after a few trips."
3,Quality Isn't Great,"The bag came fine, but I can already see the zipper being stuck and the straps are fraying a bit just from picking it up and moving it around. I'm just using this for a there and back again plane trip with my dog, but I think if you needed something for regular use, then this doesn't seem like it's the best quality for the price."
5,Good Carrier,"The Carrier was very good for my small pooch and she coud move around in it with ease. It was just the right size to slide under the seat and I liked that I could open the matted area for ventilation. The pad inside was easy to clean as my pet had motion sickness upon my return. The only thing I could have changed was the velcro in the opening for the ventilation. If it could be higher so that when it is opened it can go high enough for more air. It wasn't a problem though, but it could have been even better. I would recommend this carrier to anyone who wants to travel with small breed or toy dogs."
4,Great cat transport,"I bought two of these bags when I had to fly with my two cats during our move. One of our cats is on the larger side, but she seemed fine. I think the fact that the bag is mostly enclosed helped them keep calm during the trip. You do have to remove them at security, which may prove difficult for some animals, but there really isn't a choice. The bags did fit under the seats as well. They seemed to be constructed well."
4,Jake the Jack was happy,Our Jack Russlel Jake did well on his first flight. He weighs about 16.5 lb and is taller than the bag. Our vet suggested a sedative but only gave him half dose for a 2.5 hour flight. He was in the carrier for about 3 hours. Sturdy and plenty of ventelation.
2,Fell apart after 12 trips,"Good bag and just the right size for my 8 lb larger than average toy poodle. Good design. However, after 12 trips one of the rods of the top frame worked loose and now just hangs down unless I zip up the bag around it. This is from having to jam it just a bit to make it ooch under the Continental airline seat I guess. But they should have made that stronger. I'm trading up to the Legacy bag of the same size. I sincerely hope it lasts longer than this one did.Design is good in terms of being airy, etc. but the top problem is definitely an issue."
2,Cats on a Plane!,"We purchased two of these for our two cats for an international flight to Germany. Everything went fine for our connection flight, but 10 minutes before takeoff, one of our cats had chewed/scratched through the mesh netting and nearly got loose on the plane! Luckily I felt something by my feet move. To my amazement, half of my cat's body was out of the bag.Long story short, my wife and I took turns holding her in the carrier for the entire 8 hour flight.They almost need to reinforce the netting with some type of titanium..."
4,Airline travel with Sherpa carrier,I purchased the Sherpa travel carrier last year for a trip over Christmas with my 15 lb. Shih Tzu. For a few weeks I left it on the living room floor and put a dog biscuit it when playing games with her. I also would carry her around the house in it for a few minutes every day. On the day of the trip she didn't mind being in it as long as I was always with her. The 4 hour flight went off perfect. The carrier fit under the seat of the American Airlines plane easily but I had to push it down a little. Carrying her in it in the airport on my shoulder was tiring but otherwise it was a great trip. I would recommend it.
5,Teacher,"This is an excellent product. My students are very excited about it and every teacher in my building who has seen it has wanted to buy one. If you are looking for a way to get your kids/students to practice and want to learn their Math facts, this is a great product to purchase!"
1,Wish I could get one that works correctly,"I ordered Factor Frenzy and my kids were immediately excited to put batteries in it. They have had the Math Mat for two years and they love it so I was hoping this one would be as good. We were playing it and for some reason there was an issue with the 6, 7, and 9 ""button"". Several times it told the kids that 1 x 6 does not equal six and then when it tells you the correct answer, it said ""The correct answer is 6"". The three ""buttons"" continue to register as other numbers for some reason. I must say that when it worked correctly, it was fun. I immediately contacted Amazon and they sent me out a new one and it still does the same thing. I was really bummed."
1,Factor Frenzy a great game for the family!,"My son received this item on Easter. There was a problem yesterday when he received. First of all, though there was no screwdriver and he began to get upset but daddy found a screwdriver and it worked. The only problem is that one of the buttons were not working. The 6, 7, 8, and 4 buttons were not working when my son types in 4 the device says, ""Three"" and the two keeps saying three. It's been working so far. Even when you write in the right answer it says different numbers in what my son types in. His father messes around like typing in another number beside the right number.The 7 button keeps saying eight for some reason.I would recommend this item only one star. But I would recommend this for anyone who is six years old or over."
1,Manipulative propoganda.,"This book is faulty at its best. Besides the fact that it is speaking on a gray area of the Bible as if the author's opinion was fact, (requirements for ""sound, wholesome entertainment"" are not found in the Bible) it is one-sided. Avoid at all costs. It's books like this that make the general public think we as Christians have gone off the deep end. But on the other hand, if you had a lot of fun burning books from the ""Harry Potter"" series, this is a book for you!"
5,Last Journey,I find the music in the Last Journey to be deeply moving and helpful to the grieving process. I purchased this to give to a friend who just lost his wife to cancer. I first heard this music at the time of the death of my brother and knew how meaningful it was for me.
2,So disappointed,I was sorely disappointed in this book. All i expected were simple recipes and I got gourmet recipes with umpteen ingredients. A total waste of money in my opinion.
1,Too many special ingredients,I am not very impressed with this cookbook as I was looking for everyday type of ingredients and recipes. There are far too many ingredients that are things that are specialized and expensive for the amount required in the recipes. I doubt that I will use this cookbook often. I live in a small town and many of these ingredients would be hard to obtain in my grocery stores.
3,My Review,"okay, but many recipes have ingredients I haven't or used before or heard of. Do like the protein content. Probabably would be a good weight loss book. Haven't really tried the recipes, as of yet."
4,The High-Protein Cookbook,I enjoyed the book and it was in good condition. Thank you very much the book is very helpful and the recipes are easy and delicious.
2,TOO much fat,"While this cookbook has some great looking recipes, for those of you out there who have had bariatric surgery, as I've just had, pay close attention to the fat and carbs in these recipes. Many of these recipes are made with heavy cream, butter and oils, that I can no longer have. High protein cooking should not have to be high in fat to make it look and taste good. This is not a good cookbook for bariatric patients. I wish I could return it."
2,nearly impossible for average people like me,"I am having gastric bypass surgery done in Spring and have started my high protein / low sugar diet now to prepare. This book really doesn't help me at all. I live in a small town and the ingredients for nearly every recipe in this book are strange and hard to find; not every day products the average person has in their homes or even nearby stores. Also, the steps of the recipe are seemingly made for experienced chefs. I hope o find an easier to find and read and prepare protein cookbook but this is NOT it."
2,A lot of recipes that are pretty common,"The book was ok and I kept it. However, there were a lot of ""normal"" recipes that I think everyone knows how to make. I was expecting some more out of the ordinary recipes to add to my list of good, easy high protein meals."
2,Not Recommended,This was the least inspiring cook book that I have ever purchased. I would not recommend this to anyone.
5,PERFECT,"This wifi pen drive works fantastically! It is only to put it on the USB and make some configuration in the computer, and you have a wifi at home. My kids use it to play the PSP and Nintendo DS in mutiplayer mode, and I use to connect my laptop when they are using my desktop (what happens all the time). A great product with a very low cost. I recommend."
1,Bummer,"There is no manual included, no disk either. I've been struggling with one problem after another trying to get a connection, each time I solve one problem another pops up. The manufacturer's website says a disk and a manual are included in the package, I have a suspicion they would have helped with a lot of the issues I've been having."
1,Beware of WiFi,"First of all I want to say that the seller was great and offered a refund on this horrible item. After trying for a couple of hours to get this product to work, I found out that it doesn't work on alot of computers. Now I have to go through the trouble of shipping it back."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME. I HOOKED IT UP ON MY COMPUTER AND I FOLLOWED EVERYTHING BUT THE ACCESS POINT DIDN'T SHOW UP!! WATSE OF YOUR MONEY!
3,"Mind, Brain, and Drug","This book is really dry! However, it is so full of information on the field of drug addiction medication! Besides, the cost was not really that expensive!"
3,Book for School,Only bought for school use. Full of facts but dull to read. It was an excellent price for a textbook nonetheless!!!
5,No better hairspray out there...,"I have been using Vavoom by Matrix Freezing Spray and Forming Gel for 20 yrs, and am always willing to try new products, but there simply is nothing better for me out there... If you have thick to wavy hair, but prefer a natural look, these are the products for you. The Freezing Spray is light, yet has a super not-your-grandma's-salon-hold; skip the new spray with the red cover - the smell is very strong - like stepping into a beauty salon... When these products have been pulled from beauty salons, I look for them anywhere, including other States while visiting, so glad to have found them on Amazon - never thought of looking here!"
5,adorably alice,"this game is so so SO wonderlandy! it's fantastic because it actually follows the book/movies quite a lot- you meet all the fun, kooky characters doing their weirdish things, and you get to do all the alice-y weirdish things, too! you fall down the hole, you eat mushrooms and get huge and tiny, you find keys for different sized doors, you have races and stop for silly parties. the graphics are incredible for the littleness of the gameboy- it has that disney look to it- lots of color and detail. this is my most favorite game... there's just something entirely likeable about it, even when it gets to the more difficult parts (where i'd normally start making ""grr"" noises) i just sit there smiling through it all. it would make a fantastic gift. and so you know, even though the game might sound like a girls-only type game, my boyfriend and brother have started playing this game as much as their ""fighting, monsters, expolsions"" games. it's just really, really, reeeeeally fun..."
3,Alice in Wonderland,"This game was really fun. I think it had a lot of challenging parts to it. The one thing i really hate about it is that it is sooooooooooooo short! I got the thing at 5 o'clock last night, played it for 2 hours went to bed, played it the next day after school for 1 hour and boom! there you have it. i feel i didn't get my 32.91 dollars for it."
3,Crispin Cross of Lead,"This is an interesting way to expose children to history. Although the story is fictional, it gives them a good idea of what life would've been like in historical times. However, it is a rather sad story with several difficult events happening to the most beloved characters. A parent will need to consider whether their child is mature enough for this book."
1,Scary,I found this book so scary that I had to stop reading it. I do not recommend this book to kids younger than 10.
4,A 13 Year old boy chooses his future while discovering his past ADD,"In this amazing book a 13 year old boy who is only known as Astas son loses his mother and is proclaimed a wolfs head(Any one can kill him)for doing a crime he did not commit and must leave his village. Before he left he talks with the village priest and finds out his real name is Crispin. The priest told Crispin he would tell more about his mysterious past later but, when Crispin comes back the priest is killed and Crispin leaves the vilage fearing god has truly abandoned him. Before long he meets a jugler named bear. Crispin is forced to travel with bear but they become good friends and come to a city caled Great Wexley. In the city Crispin learns more things about his past and after shocking events he and bear leave Great Wexley.This book has a wonderful plot and a shocking plot twist. I would recommend this book for readers who love action and mystery."
3,Russell's Review,I loved this book Crispin The Cross of Lead. The best part is when Crispin gets suraned by soliders And gets away just in time. This book is based in a real time called Mide Eivle Tims.
4,Laura's review,This book is great for people in 5th-7th grade. It's good for adults too. read it and find out.
5,Crispin Book Review,NickCrispin the Cross of Lead is a good book.This book has lots of adventure.I like adventure.If you like adventure this is a book for you.This is book is awsome!
4,Crispin the Cross of Lead,Crispin is a good book.Sometimes it gets boring but there are good parts in it.The bad thing is it is not as scary as it seems.It is also a good book because every chapter leaves you hanging wanting to read more.if you are wanting to read a book that makes you guess what happens then Crispin is the book.
4,"Good read, but the tale hasn't ended yet and there is no next book.","Very enjoyable series, however, the tale is incomplete. Will there be another book? The characters in this book have not reached their ultimate destination as foretold in the beginning of the series."
3,For My Library Teacher (READ WELL!),"Crispin *The cross of lead AviBilli Jo Rhinehart 5-SThis book is about a boy who is declared a wolfs head, being a wolfs head means you are accused of stealing and anyone can kill you. Crispin runs away and begins his treacherous journey to clear his name.On the way he runs into a man called Bear and Bear makes Crispin become a instrument player. Then Bear gets kidnaped and Crispin had to figure out how to rescue him. To find out what happens, try reading the book!I think this book is good for people who like adventures. My favorite character is Crispin because he is always on an adventure and is a very interesting character. Bear is also a cool person, although he is kinda scary (hints his name). This is a very interesting book filled with action nonstop."
1,Not up to Newbery Standards,"This book is an ok, quick read, but is not what I expected of a Newbery Award winner. The plot is the typical orphan boy goes on a journey. While the plot is simple enough for a third grader, the vocabulary is typical of a fifth grade book, and the theme of child born out of wedlock and deserted by dad is appropriate for high school, one must ask just who is the intended audience. This book also contains way too many adjectives, and too much violence at the end. Reads a bit like a comic book. Disappointing."
2,A Really Weird Book,"First of all, most of the books I've read by Avi are weird, but this one takes the cake. Its plot is extremely unrealistic. It could never happen. I didn't like this book, but I did finish it. I don't know why the title makes the book seem like it's about a lead cross, because Avi could remove the cross from the story and it wouldn't make a difference. Overall, it's a really boring book. I can't believe it won a Newbery. If you can help it, avoid this book."
1,UGH! This is a nasty book!,"The book crispin was totally dumb. Sorry to all those who liked it, but it was an incredibly slow starter as well as having a cruddy plot. This kid is way too religious and it interupts the way the story flows. The cross of lead shouldn't even be in the title because its part in the overall book was titchy. The events in this books are really odd in my point of view, and the characters weren't really realistic enough, even for the medival time period. I think that this book didn't deserve to win the newberry award."
4,Crispin,I thought Crispin was a great book. It was so suspensful and I didn't want to stop reading it! I loved this book.
2,Newberry?,"My daughter had to read this for her 5th grade English class. 1) I'm surprised a book with such strong religious and adult content was allowed in a public school. But we're dealing with the teacher on that one. But to the book itself.Avi does a great job of capturing the character's voice and painting the picture of a serf's life in medieval England. And that's about all I can say good about the book.It's written as a mid-grade novel but the themes (namely: the illegitimate son of the Manor Lord being hunted down and Crispen's weakening need for religion as he ""grows up"") are not appropriate for this age.I've answered my daughter's questions as needed but cannot recommend this book due to the disparity between the readability level and the content."
1,Pass on this one,"This book was not very good, I can't believe it won the Newberry Award. The main character is stupid. Also, the twist at the end wasn't that big of a twist at all. I knew what was going on from the moment that preacher was killed. This book is a waste of time. If you want a really good book to read, try the House of the Scorpion."
3,Crispin,"The book Crispin is a great book! It is good because, it keeps you thinking what's going to happen next. Crispin is about a boy named Crispin who is on his own because his mom dies. Throughout the book Crispin tries to figure out who he is. He meets people who help him figure out who he is. One of their names is Bear . He is a big help to Crispin. The author Avi wanted to keep you reading. This book was a little slow in the beginning, but it got really good! I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and mystery."
3,Crispin The Cross of Lead by Javier,"The title of this book is Crispin The Cross of Lead, by Avi. I think this book is pretty good because its about a 13 year old boy name Crispin whose mother died and a guy named John Aycliffe who claims him a wolf head. So Crispin Asta's son decides to run away and then he meets a man name Bear. What do you think will happen? Would he get killed?"
1,bad book of the year reviewCrispin,"Crispin and the Cross of LeadHave you ever been chassed by someone, but you do not know why. This is what happens to a boy named Crispin. This book is too descriptive, and on a scale from one to ten I would give it a two because it is to boring.It is a fictional book about a very religious named Crispin. He is being chased by people he dose not know and he dose not know why. He meats a jugular named Bear, Bear is helping Crispin. The surprising thing is that Crispin is Bears slave. Bear gets captured and Crispin goes tries to save him.If you want to read this book I recommend you to be eleven years old and not get board easy. This book is Crispin and the Cross of Lead by Avi. I highly do not recommend that you read this book. Again never read this book it is way to descriptive about unimportant parts of the book."
1,HORRIBLE,AFTER I READ CRISPIN I DROPPED THE BOOK AND SAID WOW IT WASN'T SO GOOD! I WASN'T INTO THE BOOK. I THOUGHT IT WAS TO RELIGOUS AND WAS A BAD BOOK OVERALL!IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE I'M BEING PICKY BUT THE BOOK WAS HORRIBLE. I USALLY LIKE AVI'S BOOKS SUCH AS THE TRUE CONFFESIONS OF CHARLOTTE DOYLE! IF I WERE YOU I WOULD BY THE TRUE CONFFESIONS OF CHARLOTTE IT'S A GREAT READ.THE CRISPIN BOOK WAS INCREDIBLY BAD ESPECIALLY FOR ME WHO LIKES SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS. IF YOU HAVENT READ THIS BOOK I SUGGEST YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
1,worst book ever,"This summer, every time i went to the library i would look for Crispin and the Cross Of Lead. When i found it and read it honstly i thought it was one of the worst books ever writen! I don't want to give away the ending but the plot in the end is the worst one i've ever read! The whole time i was reading this book i was thinking; how could this book win any medal besides worst book on the face of the planet? In my opionion 0 stars would be an over-raiting of this book!"
2,I wish I never read it,"This book to me was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was to me very boaring, and the plot was not origianal. Personaly, I hated the book. But, over all it was good, although I just didn't like it. I still suggest you read it, though, because you probobly have different tastes in things than me."
4,Crispen: Cross of lead,"Written by Eric-ChallangersCrispen is the kind of book hat you want to curl up by the fire and read. Crispen is about a young boy who just suffered he loss of his mother. Then on top of that, he is accused of a crime he did not commit. Declared a wolf's head he has no choice but to flee the village. Left with nothing but his mothers cross of lead, he sets out on his journey. On the way he meets a strange entertainer, Bear, who takes him slave. Bear reveals writing on the cross and figures out the boy's name is Crispin. Later on he the king dies and Crispin figures out.........he is the heir to the throne. If you like long suspenseful books, this is the book for you."
4,Crispin: the cross of lead,I thought that this book was really good at portraying the medieval time period. It also made the reader feel as though that they were in this world and involved with the characters. Great book
5,Crispin: Cross of Lead,"My daughter and I read this book together and in spite of being very sad, we enjoyed the message and the good writing."
4,Interesting read,"""Crispin and the Cross of Lead"" is an interesting book set in the Middle Ages. A poor worker, mistreated and beaten is left without a mother. He becomes so sad he runs into the forest and overhears a conversation he isn't supposed to. Now he is a ""wolf's head"", accused of a crime he never committed. Can he escape his death or will he perish?I rate this book 8/10 and an age rating of 11-14. If you like history and the Middle Ages, read this NOW!"
2,A Little Off,"Crispin is a good story about a boy who for most of his life is a poor nobody but discovers his real identity and gains a wider spectrum of life by meeting a man named Bear who teaches him some useful skills. I read this in about a week in my spare time and it was a good read overall. My criticism comes in because it is 1377 AD in England and Crispin is illiterate and yet in first person is able to craft a wonderful detailed first person account of his experience which makes it less believable. I believe the author could have done so much more if he wrote in third person and crafted Crispin's dialogue like that of an ignorant slave boy who probably only spoke in short choppy, fragmented sentences. Then at the end, it's like...that's it? That's what I waited 275 pages for? Did not like the ending very much at all. He could have spent another twenty pages there and cut out twenty pages somewhere else."
4,For those who enjoy reading aloud,"I've been reading Crispin aloud to my young boys, who are in 3rd and 5th grade, and we all love the story. When I first started reading, I was surprised that Crispin is considered a children's book because the language and vocabulary can be quite challenging. But, reading it aloud has helped it come to life. The chapters are short; you can read two or three at a time. And, the story has a lot of detail about 14th century England, so it's a good introduction to a period in history that few children would attempt on their own.I've seen several reviewers complain about the religious content and the appropriacy of reading Crispin in schools. However, historically, it's an accurate portrayal of what was important at that time in history. Don't be dissuaded - it's an excellent book."
3,A Little Disappointing From What I Expected,"'Crispin, The Cross of Lead"" is a story about a young orphan boy set in 1300th century England who runs away from his small village because he is falsely accused of stealing from the ruler. 'Crispin' soon finds a unique guardian who adopts him and helps him run away from the people who are hunting him down, and also helps him to figure out all the secrets he has about his life.This book was very slow for me in the beginning, and with some big words and complicated things in it, this book is probably suited to older teens and adults. In the middle/end of the book however, they're are some exciting things...but they don't really last for long. All in all, Avi has created some unique and funny characters, and has created a story that is a medium-paced tale."
5,Crispin - Cross of Lead,"I recommend few stories but this one is five stars! It is a very captivating story with great twists. The audiobook is performed very well and I can't imagine reading it without hearing the acting and words performed so well for this time period. I can understand why it won the Newbery medal. Great for adults too, as I am."
4,Good,"Starts out slow, but gets very good towards the middle and end. You'll regret putting it down and not finishing it. You realy have to see the whole story through."
3,"Pretty good, but not the best Newbery winner","Asta's son is a poor 13-year-old peasant in fourteenth century England who has just lost his mother. When he stumbles onto a meeting between the manor steward and a mysterious lord, he is forced to flee with a price on his head and a false charge of theft and murder against him. His fortune changes for the better when he is taken in by the strange and seemingly mad juggler named Bear, who teaches him his trade as well as how to think for himself. But the steward continues to pursue him, and in the final showdown he must save not only his own life but Bear's as well. This book was quick and easy read, a fascinating glimpse into the world of the past, but although the build-up was well done, the end fell a little short for me, too abrupt and a bit difficult to swallow. I think the author could have made it more substantial had it been longer. Not the best Newbery winner but still a well-written book that older kids will enjoy."
4,a true page turner,"This book is about a boy of 13 named Crispin who does not know this is his name because he's always been referred to as ""Asta's son."" He lives in the late 1300s in Medieval England and is a peasant working for Lord Furnival. He experiences a great loss in his life and on top of that is accused of stealing and killing. This leads him to flee for his life. The only possession he carries is his lead cross given to him by his mother. He encounters many adventures, one being meeting this strange man named Bear who is an unusual character with some secrets of his own. On these adventures, Crispin slowly finds out about more of his past and the reason for him being falsely accused. I did not want to put this book down. It is full of suspense and surprises around each corner. Readers of various interests will find this a true page turner. You get to experience life on the run through Crispin's eyes and get to encounter these scary and yet exciting adventures."
4,Crispin the Cross of Lead,I personoly liked the book because it makes you wonder.I like the books that make you wonder because you don't know what is going to happin.This book is gorry in some ways to and I like gorry to.In this book he is fighting for his life and he runs into this person that will help him though his jounery.
4,Cripspin The Cross Of Lead,"Crispin is a great book with a twist of adventure,mystery,and suspense. The characters have greatly shaped disctinct personalities.I would recommend this book to fifth sith and seventh graders.Some parts of the book would gross some people out , but ive always been fine with stuff like that. Avi has always been a cool autor to me so i recommend all of his book. Good job!"
2,scary,"This disheartening story is very dark and gloomy. If you are looking for an enjoyable page turner, do not read this book. I can see how it won the Award-- but I prefer light-hearted stories.."
3,Crispin: The Cross of Lead,"The book Crispin is about a boy who doesn't have a name, his mother has died, and the town is now claiming he's a wolf's head! (meaning he has stolen and is now able to be hunted and killed). On Crispin's adventures he meets a man named Bear who knows his name and makes Crispin serve him. Now the adventure is on!I thought this book wasn't that great because I like other genres of books. I most like medieval fantasy with more mature characters. This is my review, but who knows it might be the best book you've ever read!"
4,Crispin:The Cross of Lead,Wow! Definitly Avi's best book in a long time. I would recommend this book to anyone from 5-100 years old. I especially liked when Crispin was on the run in Great Wexly. You could just imagine the amount of people there and trying to run through those crowds. I was amazed by the non-stop action and twists and turns in the plot. When the end came I just died because I found out there wasn't a sequel coming out.
5,We loved this book,Great book for a Medieval Unit study! It keeps the attention and is very exciting. You are on Crispin's side the whole time...with an unexpected twist to boot!
4,Crispin the Cross of Lead,"I think this is a great book to read! This book keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. If you love fiction books, you should read this book. It's exciting, and it even has some scary parts. Crispin, the main character, was very brave! I mean how would you feel if you were a wolf's head, that means anybody can kill you at anytime. I think you should read this book! I know if you read this book you won't regret it. I am very happy I got a chance to read it."
4,"My review on the book ""Crispin""","In my opinion Crispin was a very good book. I read it in one day it was so good I just couldn't put it down. I liked it beacause there was suspence, action and the friend ship between Crispin and his new found friend Bear. It made me feel happy that Crispin went from a life of being nothing and not trusting anyone to a life of traveling the world with a friend he could trust complietly! I would recamend this book to Junior High students who like the old medival concept. I do think alot of people would like this book if they would read it."
4,jessica's review,I liked the book Crispin. I thought it was very interesting. I thought it had a lot of detail. I also liked it because it has a lot of avengers in it. I like that bear helped Crispin out and that he gave him some food to eat. That's why I liked the book
5,Aidan C. - grade 6,I think this is a great book. It is filled with action and excitement. I think the characters in crispin the cross of lead are good. I think this is a good book and I think any one would enjoy it.
3,Crispin Is a BBBBBOOOOOKKKKK By AAAAAAVVVVIIII,"Crispin the Cross of Lead was a definite masterpiece of a book. Its whole plot, foreshadowing and detail just combine to make it a wonderful piece of art. Some of the best parts of this book came towards the end were all the twists and turns of the beginning come together into one to make a spectacular ending. One example of this spectacular ending is when Crispin finds out who his father is, and why he's being hunted by everyone from his village. As I said this book is just great, a definite must read."
5,An Outstanding Book!!!!! D.M.C,"Crispin: The Cross of Lead,is one of the best books I have ever read. This exquisite book, is filled with action, mystery, and suspense. It is about a poor peasant boy in medieval England who's parents died. ""Asta's Son is all he is ever been called because Asta was his mother's name and he had no real name. To make matters worse, he is accused of a crime he didn't commit and is declared a ""wolf's head"". This means that anyone may kill him on sight. He turns to the village priest for help who is the only person the boy can trust. The Priest reveals his true name: ""Crispin"". He also gives Crispin his mother's cross of lead which she entrusted the priest to keep. With only a name and his mother's cross of lead, Crispin must flee from his villlage to stay alive. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves mystery, and adventure. Once you start this book you won't stop until you've reached the end of the book!!!"
2,Crispin a very strange book..........,"I wouold give this book a 3 star rating because this book is very confusing. This book took place on the 1300's, so there is a lot of strange language. This book contains a bunch of action packed and dramatic scenes.This book also contains religious sayings and prayers. The main characters name is Crispin. The town accuse Crispin of murdering his mother and father so the town is out to get him.Crispin runs away to the capital and he meets a man named Bear. Bear protects Crispin through out the story, but Crispin dosent know why. When they stay a few nights at the innit is when he finds out who he really was and who his Father was, but what Crispin finds ammusing is where his family and himself are from. Other than the story, Ithaought it was good because I learned what peasants like Crispin had to go through. -By Carson, A sixth grader from Maine"
5,A Great Adventure Story,"Crispin THE CROSS of LEAD was a great adventure story. in the book there was lot of .action. The main idea of this story is this boy named Crispin lost everything his mom died and now he is left alone.Now this boy meets someone named bear,he forces him to be his servent. Bear protects Crispin. now he loses bear and he is left alone again. Get ready for this action packed bookbook"
1,book,"love the movie so was excited to see the book, most likley adapted directly from the screenplay."
2,A Walk In The Dump,"This book was soooooo Boring. I read it for a book reportand would have rather read something else. The story line is hard to follow. Its was way to mushy. Its also very easy to read though, its not a difficult book, a third grader could even understand what's goin on! I would not recomend this book to anyone. -Amberly-"
1,gimme a break,"I can't believe this book has 5 stars. I myself am a total romantic, but this book didn't do anything for me. It is ridiculously easy to read, has a very simple plot-line, and has no excitement. Every climactic part lasts about a page, and the entire book is predictable. It was also written at such an easy level, I actually felt dumb as I was reading it."
4,Great classic game for the game boy...,"This is one of the few games that's well done on the gameboy! Most driving games on the gameboy have a hard time capturing the fun, because the gameboy doesn't have an analog joystick. However, motocross madness figures out how to it the dirt bike track without the clumsiness. I'd buy this classic befor you can't find it anymore."
4,The War of Northern Agitation by Southern Belle's!,"Ginny Aiken does a wonderful job of portraying life in a small southern town. (I should know, I grew up in one!) A delightful read, not just about restoring an old mansion and finding a treasure, but one of self discovery and finding the treasure of love. A good way to start a series, you will want to keep up with the Bellamy sisters and their southern hospitality/hostility!"
3,Culturally inaccurate but fun,"I found this book to be culturally inaccurate because I have never heard of a southerner being distrustful of a northerner just becuase they were born in the North. I was born and raised in south Alabama and found the reactions to Clay to be completely unrealistic. However, I also found the book to be completely entertaining and I actually read it in less than a day (and I have a 3 year old and a 2 year old). I liked it and have already reserved Lark, the next book in the series, at the library. Enjoy the book, but please don't take the prejudiced opinions and behavior of the lead character seriously!"
1,So repetitive and foolish,"Page after page of Maggie wanting to be taken seriously and not trusting Clay.And then everyone checks their brains at the door: the owner of the house is foolishly sabotaging the restoration and Clay and Maggie don't call the police or think about insurance?I had book 2 in my hands after I read this and I turned to the last few pages in the book and saw the same formula of miscommunication, betrayal and distrust and didn't bother reading."
1,The Civil War is OVER!,"Ginny Aiken's account of the romance between aConfederate-loving Southern Belle and the Carpetbagger Yankee is about100 years too late. I live in the South and I don't automatically distrust every person I meet who hails from above the Mason Dixon Line. Yet, Ms. Aiken's Magnolia Bellamy hires a Yankee restoration expert and immediately distrusts him just for his birth venue. This is totally antiquated and a ridiculous premise for a love story. I plowed through this Christian-based novel, disliking the heroine and her silly old lady friends for their vapid and unrealistic Southern dialogue and actually felt sorry for the poor hero Clay for falling in love! Ms. Aiken was way off base in her portrayal of a modern Southern working woman of the new Millenium. I've lived in the South all my life and have NEVER heard anyone use the expletive ""Flapjacks!"" Sophomoric, amateurish and a total waste of time."
1,Worked exactly once...,I bought this for my mom for her birthday. We used it on Christmas and she pulled it out to use it about a week ago and it wouldn't even turn on. When it worked it was great. But one time? I was very disappointed and so was my mom.
2,Motor died upon 3rd use :(,This product was a hit for my son's b-day party and my daughter's b-day party. When I pulled the unit out to use it a 3rd time it didn't work at all. The motor basically died :( Was a huge disappointment because we planned on using it for another b-day party.
3,buen producto,"buen producto, practico, útil, sencillo, de fácil manipulación, duradero, buena calidad, cubre todas las neceesidad para las que fue diseñado."
4,Chocolate fun for everyone!,"One warning, make sure the fountain is level. Otherwise the chocolate will make a big mess. I recomend using a small level to make sure before you warm it up and add the chocolate. Otherwise it was very simple to operate and even the adults enjoyed the fun!"
2,Legs uneven on mine,"Had to put coasters under the 2 legs to try and level it. If it is not levelled, it will not work properly. Don't know why the thing came uneven. Took forever for it to actually start looking like a waterfall. Followed the instructions and there was still a lot of space between the chocolate. Will disregard instructions next time and try to make chocolate a little thicker so that it looks right."
5,Big party success!!,"We bougth a chocolate fountain for my daugther on her sweet 16 party!We also bought the wilton chocolate from amazon -which worked very well with the fountain!It is absolutely easy to use and worked well from the first try!And it was the centerpiece for the party.... Success with both chiltren, teenagers and with the adults!I would definitely recommend this!!"
2,Not a good product,"The chocolate fountain looks like the picture, but the motor it doesn't heat like it has to i bought it for the x-mas holidays and it was a disaster the chocolate didn't stay warm so became hard and it didn't flow throw the plastic tower, people couldn't appreciate the chocolate fountain."
2,Fondue Fountain,"The advertisement said that it was stainless steel, but the tiers were plastic!!! The machine worked fine over all!!! I think the advertisement should be more specific!!!"
5,work fine,"the device works fine just as expected,and no problems of any kind came quickly to my handsI am very pleased with the product I can not complain"
4,entertainment,"I was going to rent one and decided to look at the price. this is a very good size, at a very good price, and I did the job. I purchased it for a bridal shower with two packages of chocolate and that was enough for a three hour party, and everybody enjoyed it. What I did not like was cleaning the machine. Since it is electric I was afraid to get water inside. I had to use degreaser and lots of hot water to clean it. Now it is store away for the next party, but I am already thinking of the cleaning part."
1,Poor quality - look elsewhere,We must have received a lemon. It is very LOUD and the tower wobbles. We're returning it and looking at other models.
2,"weak motor, will burn out","I had borrowed this chocolate fountain for my daughters reception. It was beautiful.... for 20 minutes, then the motor stopped. It has burned out. My chocolate was plenty thin enough.So, the only reason I purchased this, was to replace the one I borrowed."
1,Very disappointed!,"I purchased this as the centerpiece for our dessert table for my husbands bday party and spent alot of time and effort on all the condiments to dip into the chocolate fountain. The fountain started out great for the first hour and everyone loved it, but it started sputting and the motor on the unit stopped and we could smell something burning. We turned it off and discovered that the unit lacked any heat source at the mouth of the fountain to keep the contents warm enough to continue flowing and that the chocolate literally hardened and caused the unit to burn out. Engineering failure! What a waste of time and effort on this! I would definitely not recommend this unit but will consider a commercial grade unit for our next fountain. Definitely a big disappointment but Amazon is amazing with its return policy so we received a full refund. Thanks Amazon!"
1,sucks butt,i got this product as a valentines gift. Did everything the way instructed.worked 4 about 10 mins n then motor died crap this machine is crap.
1,Very Disappointed,"The very first time I used it, it worked lousy. I carefully read all the instructions and made sure to follow exactly, yet the small dinner party had to do without a properly working chocolate fountain."
2,bad seal,"I got this for a New Years Eve Open House and decided to try it out first at the office Christmas party. It worked great at the party. I cleaned it all up and started it again for the Open House, it ran for about an hour and stopped flowing. I was busy cooking and didn't have time to deal with it also, I was getting a little upset about it. After all, it ran for a grand total of about 4 hours. Step-son jumped in took it to the shop pulled it apart and found that chocolate had leaked in around the drive shaft and it finally made the shaft so sticky that it couldn't turn anymore. He cleaned it up, put back together and it ran fine again. The Open House was slowing down by then, however. I've read about other units that stopped after a short use, my guess is this is why. Now it takes quite a while to clean because I have to pull it apart. I don't know how long it will last. I was fun while it worked."
2,Very loud,Very disappointing. Sounded more like a meat grinder. Extremly loud no matter how much we balanced it. Ran as instructed. It was for my daughter's 16th B-day party & you could hardly stand to be in the same room with it.
2,Chocolate fountian,I was so excited to use this for my Holiday party. It made such a great conversation piece for about 2 hrs than all of a sudden it STOPPED working. This product will be going back.
5,Braveheart meets Metallica aka HEAVY Bagpipes,"Thier motto is ""Scottish Bagpipes & Drums in Your Ears"" Thier music is intense and fun. This isn't you're father's bagpipe band. It is the old tunes (and new) tunes of celtic fair with a rock attitude and a good dose of humor. If you can't see them live this is the next best thing. If you grew up with rock and enjoy the traditional pipe tunes too this CD is for you. PS on thier new CD ""Hammered"" they do a cover of ""Radar Love"" which is a awsome."
1,Weak Attempt and Misapplied Theories,"There are only 3 out of 12 pertinent chapters of this book. The other 9 chapters are an extraneous rambling to take up space on paper. The author even goes as far in this irrelevant material to discuss topics such as art collecting. The pertinent chapters are not useful because of misapplied theory. For example, the author does not present the Black-Scholes methodology correctly and improperly defines profitability of an ""in-the-money"" option. To me this is a marketing ploy through Decisioneering.I recommend books by Johnathan Mun, Robert Hull, Richard Brealey, and the CBOT."
3,Not too helpful,"The title made buying the book interesting, but I was kind of disappointed when I purchased the book. For someone with a good quantitative background or some real experience dealing with real options and monte carlo simulation, this book would prove to be frustrating. It takes shortcuts by using (to the point of promoting) the Crystal Ball software by Decisioneering. Unfortunately, the book doesn't come with a trial software of Crystal Ball like some other real options books, so you only have to rely on the pictures in the book. Aside from this, the discussion of many topics is very watered-down. The author doesn't go in too much depth, and there is not much takeaway from this book. I suggest buying a different book for your needs."
5,Superb Homage CD,"Each piece in this CD pays homage to another artist. It's a unique collection of late 20th century compositions by superb guitar player/composers. These composers have melded several contemporary forms including Rock and Roll, Jazz, New Age, Folk and World music into a new form (age) of classical music. I call it the Melding Age. The most interesting is Dyens. His music creates a totally new sound world. Challenging, yet it quickly grows on the psyche. Ricardo Cobo is superb as always. The recorded sound is a little bit distant but still very good. Highly recommend you explore this CD, it's well worth it."
4,Stone Nowhere Review,"This band rocks. Kind of a weird blend of Pearl Jam, Blind Melon, Radio Head and Red Hot Chili Peppers gives them a very original sound. Great vocals!"
3,Ray Gillen Reincarnated,"Forget all the 70s bands cited as influences on The Quill. If you remember Ray Gillen's late-80s bloozmetal band, Badlands, you've got all the reference points you need. (Badlands' second album was called VOODOO HIGHWAY, just to re-emphasize the comparison.) Singer Magnus Ekvall is an uncanny vocal-double for the late Gillen, and while there's no Jake E Lee-alike on board here, the band behind Ekvall cooks up plenty of fiery heavy blues, albeit slowed down a notch to meet rigid stoner-rock specifications. Shame of it's that The Quill's preceding two cds were much stronger affairs...still, VOODOO CARAVAN's okay, and it grows on you over time. Especially when you're in the mood to hear a Badlands record."
1,not great,"As an idea, Crusty Demons isn't so bad. As a game, it's weighed down by frustrating controls and lackluster presentation."
5,Fun read,"I borrowed this board book from the library and my 3 year old daughter enjoys it. It has a rhythmic rhyme and is a fun read for both of us. Plus, it is a nice introduction/review to farm animals and the sounds they make. DD can recite parts of it like, ""Horses say, nay, nay, nay"". We both have a good time."
4,"Action-packed, but character use could be better","I enjoyed this book. If you're a fan of action-adventure series, this really satisfies the craving. The story is action-packed, though I did notice that a tendency for characters to suddenly appear out of nowhere and take part in the action, as if the editor wanted to make sure every Stony Man team member appeared in the story. If you're not already familiar with the various team members from previous novels, don't expect a lot of character background, as the writing centers on the action sequences."
1,Stop In The Name of Bad Christmas Music,"Hurts me to type anything other than praise for these women, but this one is better used as a coaster than a CD. Wouldn't buy it again for a dollar!"
2,Questionable,"I wish I felt the same as the other reviewers. I didn't find the H & H to be as memorable as I would've liked. What jumped out at me was the scene where the heroine wanted to make love to the hero after she was harassed and threatened to be raped in an ally. I have a friend that was nearly raped, and the last thing she had on her mind at that time was sex, which makes the scene a little hard to buy. If it weren't for that I'd feel better about the story."
1,The Worst Game in U.S. History,"I really never understood this game completely, so I sold it. By the way it is so hard you'd have to be very good to average a triple-bogey for every hole."
5,Great!Great!Great!,This IS the BEST book i ever read! I only wants to THANKS Jack Vance. This book helps me to overcome MANY obstacles in my life and to understand who am i and to change me in a better way! Adam Reit is my favorite!
5,a gem,"Jack Vance writes like an Impressionist painter.. rich colors, few brush strokes, rich in nuance, evoking clear and compelling images. His action sequences are a remarkable experience: sometimes everything happens within one or two pages, but within that brief space heroism and knavery have danced before the reader's eyes, and the plot has done a back-flip. Adam Reith's escape from Tschai is as often diverted as thwarted, and the authors's roving eye follows the path with substantial realism and credibility, within the sci-fi premise. The many minute details of observation are always rewarding, augmenting the vividness of characters and polts. Vance's deft and straightforward writing make his work an enjoyable experience for all ages.Written in the late 1960's, Planet of Adventure reflects the flamboyance of the times, and also the joys and tragedies, but Vance neither makes nor requires references to anything beyond his distant vision, and he remains a robust read today."
4,Planet of the Extremely Descriptive,"This story is extremely descriptive. Not only did I feel like I was completely immersed in another world, I was hooked by the storyline. Jack Vance rules."
2,Very much like Edgar Rice Burroughs,"If you enjoyed the John Carter of Mars series, I think you'll enjoy this colletion of books. It's a bit darker than ERB as I remember them, but very much in the same genre."
5,Fun science fiction adventure novel,"I like Jack Vance, but I don't like everything he's written. This one was a stand-out for me. It is an adventure story about a very capable hero stranded on a planet inhabited by humans and a bunch of alien races. For me, Vance is the best at creating strange human habits/cultures and believable aliens. I couldn't put this down, just because of its sheer entertainment value. It's not going to change your life, but it does provide a lot of entertainment for your money. For a while after reading this book, everyone dressed all in black made me look twice..."
2,There is a reason this is not widely available,"I loved Whale's first couple of singles, and indeed their first album ""We Care.""To be honest, I hunted this down at some length but only to find one or two songs that ANY of the first album's appeal. Less guitar, less yobbo cheering, less Tricky...This is screwed! Beware, unless you for some reason liked Whale's ballads best..."
2,Not worth it,"This is not even an official MWH release. If you don't have the songs, Heaven, Tomorrow Today or the Freeways (Euromix) go and search for the Men Without Hats - Silver Collection. It includes those tracks and even Rhythm Of Youth. AND it comes with a DVD."
4,"Informative, but not for the basic reader","This book is full of interesting facts and data on the full scope of Ancient Egyptian history. More of a scholarly work than an easy read, but very useful for researchers and history buffs. I was a bit disappointed with the book, since many facts were presented with little or no explanation. Overall, worth the time to read."
5,Adddiction Treatment: A Strengths perspective,"Great book, I am a grad student, book is informative and relatively relaxing to read, as opposed to the challenge of other grduate level reading matter. Particularly like the harm reduction focus, whereby the individual is supported to make positive changes. Policy makers would benefit from this read!"
5,Great crib alternative,"Taking my friend's advice I purchased this ""playard"" instead of a crib and it has been one of the most useful baby items. We padded the bottom with a blanket under the sheet and my daughter slept at the high position up to her 7th month after which we had to lower it to prevent her from flipping over. Now at 11 months she still plays in it, naps during the day and sleeps at night. The playard is easy to fold and unfold, convenient to travel with, but we never took the changing table, which I used rarely only in the first few months. The animals were not very interesting to her in the beginning, but soon enough she acknowledged the black and white zebra by smiling at it and batting it often. Later she started biting into everything including all of the animals, which are small enough and to aid teething. I suppose we will still use this playard until she outgrows it and starts sleeping on the full-size bed we have in her room (with protective bed rails, of course)."
5,Excellent - Perfect and worth the few extra dollars,"I purchased this playard and absolutely love it! I have set it up in my family room and without exception, have received compliments about how beautiful it is from everyone who has come over to visit.What I love about this playard:-It has a well cushioned (and washable) pad/mattress which makes it very comfortable for baby to sleep in.-It has a larger sleeping area compared to other brands.-It is easy to pack-up and set-up.-It has a sturdy structure (including the bassinet).-The material is very plush and it also has meshed sides and retractable panels.-The play gym is VERY cute and definitely a bonus feature.-The change table folds away."
4,prisoner treatment,"About half way through this book and it is holding my interest. I would not say it is the type of book I can't put down and come back later to see what happens. If one is looking for lots of action, they should look elsewhere. It is a good study of characters in a very confined area."
4,Swarovski Crystal Bracelet,It doesn't look exactly like in picture but people keep telling me that is a beautiful bracelet which pleases me.The big stones are not cut exactly like in this picture. but it still looks ok.
3,Dissapointing,"I excpected an Intense extreme adventure but instead I got Big Bird and the Gang, oh well its still the greatest GAME BOY GAME."
1,Worst product I have ever ordered from Amazon!,"I am usually happy with the products that I order through Amazon. This was not the case. Proxacine upset my stomach, dried out my sinuses, made me ache all over, and kept me awake. 911 Health Shop would not allow me to return the item. If you have any doubts about this product do not order it. I will never order from 911 Health Shop again, and am seriously thinking about closing my Amazon account. I am out over $36 and no one really seems to care. Guess I will stick with GNC!!Proxacine (Compare to Proxenol) by Dr. James Chappell & Earth Force Products - 90 Vegetable CapsulesI rated this one star only because I had to give a rating for my review to go through."
4,Handy tool!,"The double edge make this very versatile, made the job quicker. I would recommend this product to my to friends."
5,Awesome product!!,"I agree with Kevin Stewardson. I have one of the original 20 hour machines and have had very few problems with performance or functionality. I hooked my unit up the same way using a splitter so I can record one show while watching another. Setup was a breeze and customer support has always been there for me.I am in the market for a 60 hour machine and see no reason to switch to Tivo. Tivo may have the market share, but no matter how many reviews I read, Replay always comes out on top. One great thing about Replay machines are the software upgrades that are downloaded to the machine with each new release. No matter how old the machine, you will always have the latest software. The few complaints I had about software quirks have been addressed in the software upgrades since I originally purchased the machine. The Replay folks are obviously listening to the users.You need to make your own decision but I think the choice is clear."
1,"Unreliable, that's what it is","When it works it is wonderful. Most of the time it doesn't work and one is on hold for hours waiting for the customer support. Most recently they offered to replace it and required that I include an authorization number to return it but I cannot get the authorization number. Before that the remote failed. I have never before had any kind of remote fail. Then it cost [a lot]for a remote, as compared to [a lot less] and up for TV remotes. I had planned to buy one of their newer units until I had these kind of problems. Now I intend to buy TiVo and hope it is more reliable."
1,DO NOT Buy from replaytv.,They do not provide product updates and there machines reboot often.When we canceled there service they continued to charge us until we noticed them in our credit report.There devices are inferior to tivo and they are in a downward spiral.
5,great product,"it's changed my life :) now i can do whatever i want, and I don't have to arrange my schedule around a few shows i want to see.I bought the first replaytv available, back in 1999, for $1400 i think it was. maybe more. anyway, i noticed that for a while after i bought it, i watched more TV than ever, because suddenly i could watch anything i wanted to.then after a while, a few months, i watched less tv, because the novelty of watching CBS Sunday Morning on Tuesday night wore off. But now i just watch what i want to watch. And it's great for shows liek the simpsons, where there are a lot of little jokes. if you're watching and you think you missed something, just hit instant replay and watch it again. Or hit instant replay and then slow-motion and catch every single joke :)a great product :)"
1,Hard Drive Failure,"I bought this unit in October, 2000. Within three months it began to whine, and finally froze. Hard drive failure. The manufacturer agreed to replace it--but I had to pay the $67. shipping charge.After two more months, the hard-drive on the replacement unit failed also!!!!!!! Another $67. bill to send it back for replacement.For three years I've also had a TIVO unit. Never a bit of trouble with it. Wish I'd bought another Tivo--instead of this miserable RePlay unit.Addendum-9/23/01. Third unit arrived on Thursday. It failed on Saturday. It appears to be a failed unit sent back by someone else, not repaired properly, and sent to me as an ""exchange unit."" Quality control is not a strong point!!!!!"
2,Shalajit,"The first time I bought this product, I bought it from another company that I took the time out to check added ingrediants. I didn't want Magnesium Sterate included as it is bad for you ( I won't go into why here) and there was none in their product, but, when I tried this company, I forgot to call first to see if theirs contained the Magnesium Sterate. Sure enough, it arrived and it did contain this bad ingrediant. Wish I hadn't purchased it and was too lazy to send back for a refund. I will go back to the original company I used next time.I understand the Magnesium Sterate is used as an inexpensive binder, but I'm sure there are better processes that can be used and prefer to stay with companies that don't use these products. I'm taking these things to get healthy not to add more problems to my already over-taxed system."
5,Love it!!!,I feel like this product save my life. I feel so much healthier now. I tack it with a combination of other vitamins and herbs. It completely stabilizes my type 2 diabetes. This is the best I felt in years. I've been taking it for a while and I feel wonderful.
3,Worth watching,I saw a preview for this movie a long time ago and I wanted to see it really bad. I decided to purchase it and I don't regret the purchase but I would have rented it if I had the option. The movie is cute and sad in the fact that it shows holes in the legal system when it comes to the custody of children in the system.
3,Certainly not an acedemic book,"While this book gives a lot of interesting information and a different perspective concerning the Egyptian theology and philosophy and its cosmology. I found some of the conclusions hard to swallow and others made simply out of whole cloth. The dedication to the Ammonite Foundation leader in Cairo is telling in that it suggests that this is somehow a continuation of the old ways. I am perplexed as to what they may have been since one would be hard pressed to find exalted priestess in the ancient ways of egypt. Basically this book combines some of the worst aspects of the so-called ""New Age"" and cloaks them in legitimate ancient teachings. This is not a book in which one gets accurate historical information but rather a conglomeration of various new age prattle and Dianic rhetoric. If you can overlook that there are some bits of good information to be gleaned from the book."
1,ARRRRGH!!! How does this junk get published??,"There's only one word for this book: bad. Crystal cat people from another planet doesn't make for good science fiction, much less a serious religious study. Avoid this book at all costs and go for something REALLY good instead like Erik Hornung or something!"
1,read it for a laugh,"Anyone doing a survey of pseudoscience and bad archaeology should include this book. I just randomly flipped it open and was greeted with this nonsense:""strong nuclear force (FIRE) Transmutation (Orderly)Electromagnetism (AIR) Communication (Chaotic)Weak nuclear force (WATER) Dissemination (Chaotic)Gravity (EARTH) Manifestation (Orderly)""Come on, folks, if the Egyptians had any clue about modern physics, Tesla's inventions, space travel, time travel, etc. they wouldn't have been overrun by the Nubians, the Persians, and the Greeks."
4,good introduction,This is a good introduction to operations research with emphasis on linear programming. It is at about the same level as Hillier and Lieberman but I prefer the book by Hillier and Lieberman for an introductory course at the masters level.
3,Filter works,This filter just barely fits inside the notches of the humidifier. The original company doesn't make them any more. This is the longest filter I've found.It does hold it's shape/stands up and seems to work like the original one did.
2,"nice idea, but not well implemented","It sounds really nice to be able to recharge your iPAQ with a USB cable, but in reality it's not that simple. Take a look at the sticker on the power supply (recharging cable) that came with your iPAQ--it puts out 2 amps of electricity. Most USB ports are only set up to handle .5 amps per port, so in order for this cable to properly recharge your iPAQ you have to plug this cable into an externally-powered USB hub, otherwise there just isn't enough juice for it to work. You will be sorely disappointed is your try charge your iPAQ with this cable hooked up to anything else (laptop USB, internal USB port, etc...)"
2,Not enough attention to detail,"The concept is attractive: charge your iPaq using the USB port on your notebook computer.On my Toshiba Tecra 9000, there's not enough power output from the USB port to charge the iPaq 3650. Worse, Windows 2000 keeps thinking the cable is a Toshiba Wireless LAN adapter and tries to install drivers for it.The plug for the iPaq isn't well designed: it's too large, tempting the user to use excessive force attaching the cable."
3,Works but....,"I bought one of these because I have two cradles, one at work & one at home. Sounded like a nice idea. However, it only charges if the PC is on, even if the USB Hub is self-powered.I use the power adapter that came with the my Compaq at work (where I need the juice) and use this gadget at home. So, it has worked out ok so far.Buyer beware of this limitation."
4,Better than the originals!,"I couldn't listen to the old Mercury originals--some of the remakes on Columbia eg ""With my eyes wide open..."" were better. Although this 1970's remake lack the youthful immocence of the originals they more than make up in sophistication--just what I want. But don't bother with even later remakes, after Patti is over the hill!"
3,Makes music?,"Purchased for children, under age 5. Like the fact that it was contained in a plastic case to keep the instruments together, although I can't say the kids were diligent in keeping them together. A little overpriced."
2,Code too small,"I might have given this book a higher rating as it does not seem like a bad book, but the fact that I have to use a magnifying lens to see the code is a bit ridiculous. Taking screen shots and using them as the code for a book is really a poor way to write a book. Hopefully this author does not do this on any newer books."
2,Not what I expected,"I didn't read the description very well. My son has enjoyed the other Olivia books, so I bought this one to add to the collection. I didn't read the description very closely. I was sad to discover that the book is basically a cut-and-paste of graphics from other books. There isn't a story, just inspirational quotes.Normally I wouldn't give a poor review because of my mistake, but I really see this book as someone's attempt to get a little more cash from a franchise without actually creating any original content. I was disappointed to see the same images from our other Olivia books thrown together like cheap clip-art."
2,NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK,Clearly I didn't read the description carefully or when I pre-ordered it before it was released there wasn't a good description. This is not a book for children. It is a book of inspirational quotations by other people with illustrations of Olivia. A book for adults.
3,Positive book.,"Adorable illustrations. I bought it because I didn't understand the allure with the famous Olivia pig. Now that I've read it, I commend the illustrator on his cute pictures of an active and imaginative pig, but was a bit disappointed because I expected a story and received quotes from famous people with pig pictures next to them. The quotes are memorable and have a positive nature to them, but too old for the normal Olivia readers level of understanding."
3,Nice book but not for my 2 year old,"So I got fooled (perhaps a harsh word) into buying this book as part of one of Amazon's bundles...with Missing Toy & Olivia Saves the Circus. I failed to read the detail on what the book is. It is a book of inspirational quotes. While not doubt the quotes are great (I've now added one to my facebook profile) this isn't a book for my 2 year old Olivia obsessed daughter. I may put it away and give it to her when she turns 18 or graduates from high school like another reviewer states. Also, something to note, none of the pictures of Olivia are new...if you've read all the other books you've seen these.In short...great book...but not a children's book."
3,more of a coffee table book,We love this version of Olivia. This book is full of great pictures and quotes. It made me think more of a coffee table book rather than one for kids.
5,Olivia always the Dreamer,"Lovely well presented book. More of a motivational book probably a bit of a difficult concept for young children to understand. Filled with short phrases that inspire. Would suggest this book is more for 10 year old children. However, daughter of the same name will come to enjoy this in years to come. Lovely red sleeved cover, usual glossy pages and simple pics we have all come to know of the Ian Falconer Olivia range."
3,"This is a book of quotes, not a children's story book.","This is an adorable little gift-type book for the right person. Unfortunately, I bought it thinking is was a children's story book. While I was disappointed, it is my own fault for not reading the description more carefully."
2,Not a fan - wasn't really an Olivia story,"I was actually looking to buy Olivia stories and did not realize this was just a book of quotations with pictures from the Olivia books. So needless to say I was disappointed, perhaps because of my own failure to read more closely about this book before I got it. I suppose if you are a quotation person you might like this book. ?"
3,WE LOVE OLIVIA!,"This book is cute but its not a story. Its just quotes from, famous people? Children wont understand it."
4,"Not Perfect, But A Must Have","Essential equipment for the m515 user.The device has a little light on its neck that turns from red to green when the battery has been fully recharged. I like this.It seemed to take my m515 about an hour to take a full charge when I was on the road with it the first time, during which it was used very lightly (I looked up two phone numbers). I don't know if the speed is a function of the m515's battery or the charger itself.The cord could be a little longer to enable easier use of the Palm whilst it is being charged."
3,Rock 'n' Roll High School is ok,"I bought this item because of Rock 'n' Roll High School. It was fun when it first came out and I thought the price was right. It was ok watching it again, but not as much fun as the first time. The second movie on there is junk..."
3,Rock and Roll High School Forever,"used to love this movie as a kid. its so cheesy, but im happy to have it!"
3,1 good movie...1 horrible movie,"as i huge fan of the original rock and roll high school movie i always enjoyed this classic corey feldman b-movie. however, stay away from watching south beach. i enjoy bad movies every now and then but south beach ids just horrible!"
5,Amazing. Buy ALL of Red Mountain Church's CDs.,"My wife and I had a guitarist play ""Christ, Or Else I Die"" at our wedding.Truer words have never been sung."
5,amazing guitar,"the beautiful guitar work, moving from electric jazz to acoustic, to latin flavored music, all with a blues feel is extraordinary. the segues are seamless and blend beautifully. i especially love the use of percussion."
5,Absolutely Reiki,"been playing this album for years and definitely one of the better Reiki CD around. Tonal quality created by Anuvida instrument (kiboe) is unique - sounds like a cross between harp+guitar+mandolin Track 1: Point of departure - simply relaxing Track 2: Empty Sky - very rhythmic and perfect for meditative & breathing exercises (reiki or otherwise) Track 3: Circle of Light - faster than #2 but equally rhythmic, excellent for bodyworkMay the Light of Reiki generated by this album be shared by everyone."
2,RIPPED OFF,Mouth had clay in it. Gears were grinding. Couldn't return as my nephew picked this gift out for Christmas. Was not in the condition I expected.
4,DINOSAUR,XMAS PRESENT FOR PRE-K GRANDCHILD. VERY GOOD TOY WHICH LIVED UP TO ITS HIGH REVIEWS THAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY RESEARCHED. SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED THE T-REX WHICH MOVED AND APPEARED TO HAVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIEGENCE. DECIDED THAT TOY MUCH COMPLICATED FOR YOUNG CHILD.
2,Broken before it arrived! Big disappointment,"I bought two of these for my two boys for Christmas. One arrived and worked fine - it roars and moves its head. The second arrived and only roars. It never once moved, as it is supposed to. I would not recommend this toy and never at the prices that they are asking for now. I paid $30 retail. Good luck if you decide to purchase, as you don't know what you'll get or if it will be in working order."
4,Tango - twofer,"Adriana Varela has a great tango voice, smokey 'garganta con arena' - and this is a fine cd of her early recordings. In fact it combines her first and second releases on one cd, so don't hesitate if you are looking!"
3,Too High Priced,"My dog loves these. They're a special treat for her. She even knows them by name, and where we store them. She loves taking people over to where the Scooby Snacks are, and show them, so she can get a snack.But....holy yikes the price. It would be five star if not for the price. It's easily double, more like triple the price of other vendors. Amazon, do you really expect us to pay 11$ a box? It was bad enough when they were 7$ a box. You are only inspiring me to look elsewhere. That makes me sad. It's so much easier to order from Amazon, but not at that price."
2,Too big,"The treats are not like the picture on the box, it's a lot bigger. I bought it a Shiba Inu who weighs about 20lbs (medium dog) - and she has trouble chewing. I had to break it up with a hammer since I couldn't even break it up with my hands. The circular ones are harder to break. I don't recommend it for small-medium dogs (even though that's what the package says it's for).But she still loves the taste, she just can't chew it on her own so I pre-hammered all of them in the box. Tedious and it flies everywhere, so I won't be purchasing this again for her."
4,Very cute book,"We are a dog family so we love stories about dogs. The plot is cute about all the things your dog might do while you are away. Illustrations are whimsical. My daughter likes it, I liked it alot."
2,High price for such a low quality product,"Purchased this mirror for an elderly family member when the one on their '96 Olds Achieva fell off and shattered.At first, I thought the price (approx $20) was reasonable as I have replaced mirrors on my '89 Riviera, '01 Ram and '03 Caravan and those mirrors were at least double and triple in price.Unfortunately, the mirror I received was made unbelievably cheap, needed some modification to fit and should have cost less than half of what I paid for it.This mirror is just a piece of 1/8"" extremely brittle glass that was cut completely unprofessionally and needed one edge to be refined to fit in the plastic mirror housing. Once I ""shaved"" the side, it did fit and I opted to adhere the glass to the plastic housing with silicone adhesive instead of using the totally unsticky double stick tape that was provided.I have purchased many Dorman products, but because of their lack of quality control, I may consider other alternatives in the future."
1,This thing does not work,"Bought it; didn't work. Returned it for another---didn't work. Tried both on Mac and PC, on USB ports that worked with Palm's hotsync cradle.Called tech support . . . they concluded that it wouldn't work.So I returned it for store credit.Bottom line: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT."
4,Cheap and Simple Hot-Sync,"I bought this to supplement my cradle for Hot-Sync at home and work. It has worked fine with my Tungsten T. This is not a travel charger -- you need a ""hot"" USB port for it to charge (but that's all you need; no extra power cord required). The cable that came with mine was kind of short, so if I didn't have a USB hub on my desk, I might have needed a USB extension for it."
1,Do not buy this product!!!,"The workmanship is terrible. Mine came missing most of its pins and it does not Hot Sync. Now I need to pay shipping and handling there and back to have it replaced. The Palm cradle is poor too, but at least it worked for 9 months before breaking."
4,Works as promised,"I've had this cable for the last several months and it works great.I bought this cable after being disappointed with the Palm USB hotsynch and recharger cable. (Note: I returned the Palm cable back to Amazon for a full refund because it just didn't seat properly in my Palm Zire 71 to allow for continuous recharging, not to mention a one of the plastic connector pins snapped off after only two uses!).Just like some of the other posts, the cable does not have a hotsynch button (so you have to hotsynch using the PDA's icon) and does appear to have some pins missing...but it apparently does not affect the proper functioning of the hotsynch and recharging.It is a good replacement for the cradle and is particularly useful when traveling (occupies very little space when coiled up inside a laptop bag).The only thing I wish that it had is an adapter so that I can recharge using a car lighter if I wanted to."
2,33 x 80 extra long size,"The bag I received is not 33x80, it measures 29x72 stretched out. The bag appears to be of fair quality. Although I have not used it because I will be sending it back, if it was the correct size I think it would be OK."
2,Zipper broke,"Just got it, and the zipper is broken. Returning. Don't know how they can put such a flimsy zipper on such a large sleeping bag."
5,Great early stuff!,"This is good for earlier stuff. I like it for the demo of ""surfergirl."" I also liked hearing the end of the session on ""surfin""and ""Surfin safari"" [also a demo]. I'm glad I bought it."
1,not what i expected,"this universal adapter arrived sooner than expected, however the plug very plug i needed was twisted. Also since the adapter was advertised with the portble cd player I ordered, it assumed it was the same brand as well as designed for the player. That was not the case."
3,Unclear instructions,"It did the job the one time I used it, but there were some confusing instructions."
1,looked like a nice item,"however, the darn thing never worked from the first day i got it. i dunno why. I tried everything. It just didn't work. So, i guess if you purchase it, be prepared to send it back."
2,Very tempermental,"It works with Vista well without any problems, but we needed to connected it to a Mac and XP machines, which proved quite difficult. The connection to the Mac was especially inconsistent, many times we could get no connection and once we had it, it would get lost soon after. The connections we did get across all the platforms was a very slow, and it took a great deal of time to transfer data. We returned the LaCie after two days and are still searching for a better solution to shared storage across platforms."
1,Too bad...,"Lacie is the worst NAS i have ever used. It worked for 6 motnhs. The power was done once in my home and that's it. The drive never worked in ethernet. To recover my data, I tried USB without any luck.Dont every buy lacie.. worst ever.0 STARSBTW, I sent to Lacie for repair, they sent it after 1.5 months. Later when i unpacked it and it worked for 1 day and then stopped working again. It would not recognize from the network. This is worst NAS ever i have used."
2,"Works, but poor power management can/will corrupt data","I too had the issue of a broken power supply causing erratic behavior. Eventually this behavior corrupted all the data on my drive irrevocably. VERY frustrating, as unlike a standard USB device, it uses the Linux XFS file system which isn't directly accessibly to a Windows machine.One day my drive just wouldn't stop clicking. I called LaCie (40min on hold) and was told it was a power supply issue (indeed their site confirms this can cause ""broken share"" messages in the NAS config panel.) I got a new power supply, and now the drive turns on and I can actually access the drive but my previous created shares (and data) still show as ""broken"" and another 30 min call w/ tech support today confirms my data is lost. They'll fix the drive under warranty, but I lost all my video... due to a power management issue!? Poor design, not recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this initially for a video job to attach to my edit machine using USB 2.0 and then after the job, use it as a NAS on my home network.Unfortunately the performance of the USB 2.0 interface is too slow at only around 5MB per second where most of my other drives achieve around 20 MB per second using the same USB 2.0. This was so slow that it was unusable for my particular application so I felt the claim ""1 Hi-Speed USB 2.0"" was a bit misleading. The ethernet performance was slightly higher at 6MB on a 100 Mbit lan.It is the loudest drive I own. I have many Western Digital and Maxtor drives and they are all quieter.Having said all of this, I will keep it as a NAS and I am sure it will be fine. Just don't expect to move lots of data quickly."
2,Horribly slow,"After testing the device i noticed that most brands do not show actual transfer speed and only spec upper boundary using network or usb2 theoretical limitations. That is a LIE! This device gives you at most 4MB/s no matter what network you use!!! The internal CPU/Board are simply not fast enough!!!The existing USB port is another lie, since it does not function as a regular usb drive but create a network over usb2, having the same internal board limitation.Everything else works fine, only it's quite unusable, I get 10X higher speed on my 5 year old usb2 drive..."
1,Terrible Device and Customer Service,"After using it for a couple of months, the disk started locking up and the only way to make it come back up was to reboot it.Few weeks later, the disk died and even though I was under warranty, the technical support told me that they are not responsible for the data inside and that all they could do was to replace the power supply ... DO NOT BUY FROM LACIE, there are way too many BAD reviews here to take the risk."
2,BE WARNED: Very slow read/write times over wireless home network,"KUDOSconvenience of USB connectivity; large capacity at a low price; storage accessible by all network nodesCOMPLAINTSSlow read/write times over a standard basic wireless home network make the500GB Lacie Enet Disk Mini Gigabit USB 2.0virtually unusable in a practical, on-the-fly context. RELATED WARNING: The more you load onto the unit, the slower it gets!CONCLUSIONSIf you want to simply store bulk network-accessible items to which quick access is NOT needed, then this unit may be for you. But if you're wanting to do something like storing movies for common access across your network, this is NOT your solution. Read times don't come close to keeping pace with movie audio/video demands.I do not recommend this product for anyone who is not absolutely certain of what they're getting into and what other options are available."
2,Disappointing Customer Service,"This unit has operated on a network for 16 months as primary backup. The unit requires periodic maintenance to be read by the server. It is loud. The unit has failed. After 4 days of dealing with customer service on a warranty issue, my frustration has lead me to purchase a competing product."
1,Does not work with MAC OS X 10.5 Leopard,"It does not work on with MAC OS X 10.5 The network connection is extremely slow, you cannot use time machine and you get no help whatsoever from LaCie support on this.Don't buy it, waste of money."
2,"OK charger, bad batteries","The charger is somewhat larger than others I have purchased. The folding prongs help considerably when it is packed. One of the four included NiMH batteries was completely dead; the batteries are rated at only 600 mA-h, around half of the rating on the Monster batteries (so the PDA will run much less than half as long). The price is so good, however, that I'm not going to return it."
3,"Not great, but it does the job.","I really wanted to like this product. It can charge four batteries at a time and the prongs flip down for easier storage in a drawer. I'm pretty disappointed, though, that it takes so long to charge batteries (think days) and that it doesn't tell you when it's done charging. Two red LEDs tell you that batteries are connected and being charged front and/or back, but you could tell that much without the lights. I've got a Kodak charger for AA that functions much better, but I couldn't find anything other than the iConcepts for AAA."
1,No operating instructions,"...This charger comes without any operating manual or instructions. At least, it should say how many hours one should charge the batteries for. There is no automatic shut-off nor is there any indicator to show that batteries are charged and ready.Other charges for Ni-MH batteries cost [more] for the charger alone, so [this charger] with 4 batteries is definitely a deal - but one certainly expects to have a small manual with the product. Is that too much to ask? Also, there is no website for the product to get the manual downloaded."
1,one battery is dead,"I already wrote a review before, but just found that one of the four batteries is dead after one use(or maybe from the beginning)."
1,I would give zero start to this if it was possible,"I was tempted by its low price. When I got mine, my pda was running fine on original batteries. After few days the original batteries were dead and it was time to put my rechargeables in it. They just didn't work. NONE OF THEM WORKED!!!! Now I am pretty good at electronics and I didn't have them inserted wrong way either in charger or my pda. ..."
2,Very Lousey!,"I'm stuck! Who cares what these other ""people"" say! This game is the ...! I'v found the turnip but it doesn't count! My friend is having the same trouble! This game also has lousey graphics! I don't recomened this game!"
4,Very happy with Quest for Camelot,"This is my first Gameboy game I've ever played and I thought it was great. The graphics are quite good and the story line is also good. I like to explore and find stuff, and that's waht this game is all about. I also like how your skills increase as the game progresses. I would say you wouldn't be disapointed."
4,A good game overall.,"This was a good game with good graphics. There were many items to collect and lots of variety in terrain. The colors used for the backgrounds of this game are some of the most vibrant that I have seen in a Game Boy Color game. This game has a great story taken mostly from the movie and it also had beutiful animated stills to help tell the story. There wasn't much difference in the enemies except for color, and the jumping and hit detection could have used some work but all in all this was a good game that I enjoyed greatly."
2,Quest for Camelot,"I'm very dissapointed with this game. It's very confusing at the beginning and I never know what to do next. (By the way, I'm still at the beginning.) I wouldn't recommened this game; don't waste your money."
1,Incorrectly Advertised,"This is not a timing belt. It is only the harmonic belt. The title to the product is misleading, research more before ordering this as a timing belt."
4,A Paper Marriage by Jessica Steele (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:A marriage in name only? Lydie Pearson was convinced that she was the one calling the shots when she asked Jonah Marriott for help saving her family's estate. After all, Lydie's father helped Jonah build his business, so surely it's now pay-back time? Only Lydie is unaware that Jonah's no longer indebted to her family. He helps them, but only because he's an honourable man. Lydie is shocked to discover she now owes Jonah a fortune! Then he delivers an emotional bombshell: the only way he'll allow Lydie to repay him is with her hand in marriage ..."
2,you can do better,"Poor performance for the price. Not much of a range, very little base, and the right speaker crackled at higher volume! What a stinker!"
1,It stinks!,"I'm a gamer and this game is one of the worst I've played. The graphics are horrible and the action isn't there. it is exeedingly frusturating unless you get cheats. I payed $14.00 for this game and it's not worth it. It might be good for a six year old, but I'm thirteen and I did not enjoy this AT ALL! It's not worth the money,my advice is, don't buy! Hope this is helpful to you."
1,WARNING:DO NOT BUY,This game stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you want to have fun do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,???????????,"I like this doll, she's very pretty, but am i the ONLY one who noticed her tatoo? or am just crazy."
4,Review the Item please,"Yeah I just wanted to say that the below reviews are NOT REVIEWS and therefore NOT HELPFUL. Someone can preach all they want about the weakness of the method (although it is obvious from the reviews that the authors have an incredible misunderstanding of it) but that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. I read the costomers' reviews to find out if it is a quality product, not to hear an extended rant on one persons misguided idea of acting style. Anybody considering this product probably realizes that it is a comentary based in the method, and also probably has their own opinions on the acting style which are probably not so misinformed as those expressed below.The product can be illumitaing to actors whether method or not, and while Strasberg does have his flaws (by the way, when Stasberg was first working only ONE of Stanislavski's THREE books was transleated into English), he also has many brilliant and useful insights."
1,Does NOT work with Palm M125,"What is up with this cable, I exchanged TWO of these cables. It does NOT work with the Palm M125, you plug it in and nothing happends. There isn't even a SYNC button, the funny part is that the sticker on the cable says Palm M500/505 but not M125. However, the box does say M125!"
1,This book left me cold,This book left me cold. I was looking for ideas my husband and I could use but found only stories about other people. The book kept me at arm's length. I guess I am not that interested in stories of these particular people but had hoped that the author would talk to ME about what I could do my in OWN home. A waste of my money.
3,not really for the every day woman,"the photographs were lovely and so were the spaces, although personally not what i would want to live in, but i, too was disappointed with the fact that the only women profiled were super-wealthy, already famous personas. what about the millions of every day women out there who are truly inspirations and whose lives are much more relevant to the rest of us?"
2,Guess I'm not a real girl,"My husband and I are building a new home and our architect recommended we pick up copies of this book and one called 'Manspace'. This one did exactly nothing for me, I didn't like the decor much... appreciated it but it's not me and it seemed more about decor than anything else. I actually liked Manspace a great deal better. So yes, the book is full of expensive looking personal female spaces with shots that showed little else in the room but the decor which did not help me think through how to do my office / craft room. For me, it was a useless book."
1,Worst game for the gameboy color EVER!!!,"Its graphics were absolutely terrible, and so was the story line. If I could i would have given it negative points on the scale."
3,practice questions are poor,"The practice questions in the beginning of the book replicate certain areas (thyroidectomy, hernias, GI) and lack in the areas of peds and maternal health. So, the review practice questions should not be used to judge your clinical knowledge in all areas nursing. On the upside, what other study guides lack, this book makes up for them by having nice illustrations with descriptions, good rationales and meds info. Saunders and Kaplan are two books that complement this study guide."
1,Informative. Poor quality of the print.,"Nothing against the content, but the quality is bad.Tables are badly printed, missing or overprinted entries,some graphs are also missing.Publisher was not interested to provide any correction.Maybe next edition or revision will be better.Do not count on it as a single source of the information."
4,Nice compact stove for camping,The stove is very nice and I would recommend it. The only problem I had with it is that the wind shield is little difficult to install.
1,bnormal,"Don't buy from this vendor, Jacobsparts. They're careless with their orders and rude to their customers. I ordered an AC adaptor for a specific laptop and they sent me the wrong one. Then they were very rude when I requested a return."
4,Charming and wonderful!,"Shanghai Pocket is a wonderful game, and has a lot of charm with its graphics and music. The music is repetitive, but it isn't annoying, and the animals that you free by completing each stage are a nice touch; interesting that they match the Chinese Zodiac! My only complaints are 1) The size of the tiles: You WILL need a Gameboy magnifier with a light, my eyesight is fine, but would strain others with less than good eyesight or have tired eyes, and 2) The lack of a save game means that you have to play all 12 stages to watch the endgame feature! Switching the game off, or selecting ""quit"" and switching off will erase your progress, and it's tiring to play each stage without a break; thank goodness for Nintendo AC adapters! These two complaints prevented a five star rating, but it is still a wonderful game and I highly recommend it!"
2,Hard to keep together. MIssing web site,"This toy was a lot of fun for my 7-yr old daughter and I to build on a snowy afternoon. Unfortunately, some of the pieces (mill gears) don't fit onto the frame tightly, and marbles go flying everywhere. Ultimately, it turned into a lesson on poor engeering tolerances and jury-rigging. The manual includes instructions to build exactly one design. It says that additional plans can be found on the marblemaniaextreme.com web site. This site does not exist. It suggests that you share your designs with other via the web, but there is no means to do so. Overall, although we had some fun putting the parts together, I would not recommend this gift to others due to the frustration in operating the resulting design, the lack of additional design and the web site, and the unlikelihood that we will use the set again."
1,piece of junk.,"My 5 year old son is crazy about marbles and mazes. I saw this in the store assembled in a plastic case and thought it looked awesome. Forty dollars and 2+ hours later, we were ready for the big......letdown. The pieces don't stay together at all which causes it to break and fall apart a la the domino effect. We put it back together at least 3 times but it just doesn't work the way it is supposed to work. Like most toys nowadays, it's a piece of junk."
1,Non Functional,Received as a gift b/c son into marbles. Just too complicated. Neat concept though. Started assembling and could never get it to stand upright thus never able to get it to work. Unable to find alternate building designs. Just a waste of money- wish we had asked for a wooden block marble set instead. I really can't understand why it got the awards it did. Did these people try this toy? Don't waste your money unless you'd like some colorful plastic pieces to store in a box.
2,the fun is in the building,"I love marbles and chutes, so picked this up without reading the entire box. Disappointed to see it has one design set-up; the website that is supposed to have other designs does not exist. (Search engine sent me here, to Amazon.) My adult son and I spent a couple hours building it, which was fun. But the battery operation makes it non-interactive. I put batteries in the ""sound"" feature, but it reminded me of a car alarm and it made my dogs howl. Now it is large, everyone has watched it (so it is boring), and I have no place to store it except by taking it apart. So, it will go back into the box. Jigsaw puzzles are a better past time."
5,We love it!,"I think this is a great toy. I have to admit, my husband and I were taken back when we opened the box and found a million and on pieces. That was intimading, but after a deep breath and quick review of the instructions, it wasn't as bad as it looked. It was pretty easy to assemble. I can' t see any young child being able to put it together without help from an adult. It required my husband to put it together and my son was the supervisor. :-) The instructions were easy to follow and the parts are well marked. And the BEST part, it worked when it was all together! My son is a gagdet person and this is right up his alley."
3,Inaccurate for playing dominoes,"The tiles are made of wood and very durable. The problem I had with the set is that the tiles are not accurate for playing dominoes. In a standard of set of 28 dominoes, each picture is distributed over the tiles so no two tiles are the same. My set of 28 had duplicate tiles which meant other tiles that should have been there were missing. Neat concept, but poor follow through for someone who actually wants to play a fair game of dominoes."
4,"Great info, horrible design","There's a lot of indispensable information in this book, but it's amazing how ugly and bad the design is. The margins are about 1/4 inch on all sides (resulting in very crammed text) and some of the graphics are blurred & illegible. I realize that design is usually a matter of taste, but in the case of this book it really hampers its readability and usefulness."
5,Methode pour developper un produit innovant,"Vous souhaitez developper un produit innovant, ce livre decrit une methode ""customer developpement"" pour developper votre societe et ses parts de marches.Il s'adresse a vous, que vous soyez etudiant, porteur de projet, auto entrepreneur, entrepreneur,...La methode ""customer developpement"" s'appuis sur le travail deCrossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers, et devrait etre lu avant, ou a la place du livre de Moore qui est plus vieux.Les notions qu'il aborde devrait etre enseignes dans tous les MBA francais. Issue d'un Master CAAE, je regrette d'avoir perdu tant d'annees avant de les connaitre.L'auteur est serial entrepreneur (8 start-up a son actif), professeur de marketing a Stanford et Berkeley (les 2 plus prestigieuses universites de la silicon valley)."
4,Excelent book for entrepreneurs,"This book is reeeeeally amazing, it's a MUST read for anybody thinking to start a new bussiness. Very helpful!"
5,An entrepreneurial marketing classic,"With this review, I think I will simply add a comment similar to many people have already said: this book gives a very good description of the Customer Development process, which is a necessary part of entrepreneurial marketing (i.e. marketing for start-ups). This process is supplementary to the Product Development process, which focuses on a product-centric approach to creating and marketing a new venture.The book is simple and fun to read as Blank uses anecdotes and a vivid language, while numerous real-life start-up examples give readers a better understanding of the concepts. The book is definitely a classic that every entrepreneur, VP of marketing and VP of sales in a start-up should read!"
4,Step by Step..,"I got this one and the Entrepreneurs guide ebook. I was already applying Customer Discovery while it arrived, and it's been a great source of information, helping me guide the strategy of the company i've just created."
5,"Excellent book, wish i'd read it sooner","This is a brilliant book, and I wish I'd had it sooner. I'm in the middle of the startup process myself and this book has forced me to reevaluate some of our assumptions and really test them thoroughly.My only comment is I wish there was a bit more information on how to test the assumptions - this is a bit glossed over as it skips straight on to the sales road map stage."
1,Not a good thing to buy,"6 screen protectors, 6 different sizes... 4-in-1 style will lose color and look old in two weeks, one thing useful is the carrying case, however it will make your PDA look too big."
1,Poor Quality,"I was excited when I found this starter kit here and it seemed that it provided all solutions. But the quality of the leather case is bad, the screen protectors are ok, and the quality of the 4 in 1 stylus is very poor. The cap of the stylus would pop out every time you switched off. Definitely would not recommend this product."
1,What a ...!!!,"Please, please don't spend a dime on this kit.1. Don't be fooled by the phrase that says ""Pack of six Screen Protectors"" : Well, there are actually 6 protectors, but if you have Compaq iPAQ, you'll have only one protector. One protector per each of 6 different PDAs. I was so upset because my iPAQ protector sticker was even missing when I opened the box. What am I supposed to do with a bunch of stickers for Palm, Visor and Clie?2. Only one pair of wet and dry cleaning pads.3. Leather carrying case : using velcro, simple, and not so impressive.4. 4-in-1 stylus : too big and too heavy to carryI should have bought a seperate cleaning kit or multiple screen protectors only."
2,A little oversold,"I read all the reviews on here and purchased the starter kit with my new clie based on the enthusiasm displayed. However, I am a bit disappointed. The 6 screen protectors were not universal, they were for specific handhelds and none for my clie. I tried cutting one to fit but ended up with alot of bubbles and just got rid of it. The case is a little bulky and prevents you from putting the PDA in your pocket. The wet dry wipes are okay but other stuff on the market, like glass wipes and alcohol wipes, will do the same thing. The only really useful item is the 4in1 stylus but the black ink quit working after 3 days. My advice is not to order this until you use the PDA for awhile and then decide that there are some additional items needed to make it more useful."
4,Not really necessary,This is a good deal but I'm sending mine back as I don't really feel that any of the items are necessary. The case doesn't really fit the palm m105 so don't bother.
1,Not Worth Anything!,"Here are 4 reasons why you shouldn't buy this:1) The wet/dry wipes are practically worthless. They leave your screen sticky and hard to clean again.2) The case is made of inexpensive, low-grade leather and the credit card slots are too small to fit regular size credit cards.3) The 4-in-1 stylus does not work well. If you try to switch pens it won't work.4) There are not 6 screen protectors for your PDA. There are 6 screen protectors, 1 each for 6 different PDA's. The screen protectors don't go on well and have air bubbles underneath them.This product is practically worthless. My advice is to spend a little bit more $ and buy a high quality leather case, use water instead of alcohol wipes to clean the screen, because it works just as well, and use the stylus that comes with your palm. Screen protectors are practically worthless; by the time your screen gets really damaged, your palm will be very outdated and you'll probably end up buying a new one anyway."
1,"A ""case"" of poor design","I purchased this product from a retail vendor. The pen is about the only thing of real value. The case looks great from the outside but to secure your handheld in it, you have to stick a velcro square to the back of the handheld. I refuse to disfigure my m500 in this manner."
2,misleading,The starter kit statement that there are six screen protectors is misleading. There is only one protector in the pack that will fit your PDA. I found the case to not be very good protection because it does not zip around to enclose the PDA.
1,Adjustable periscope,Product is not air tight. Air escapes when the dryer is on. Poor quality product. Will not stay on the dryer or the wall connection if the dryer is even slightly moved. It fell apart so we cannot even return it for a credit.
2,NOT ONE OF MAX'S BEST WORKS,ANY BIBLE BASED INSTRUCTION IS GOOD BUT THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE BY RICK WARREN HITS RIGHT ON THE MONEY WHERE MAX MAY NOT DRIVE IT HOME AS WELL ON THIS ONE.
4,It's Not About Me!,"I'll be honest, I'm not the biggest Lucado fan because I tend to think that his books are only surface deep and I tend to want something more challenging in my walk with Christ. With that being said, I have wanted to read ""It's Not About Me"" for quite some time. This hardback edition focuses on how our life is really not about us. I've heard that so often before in the church, ""that's its not about me,"" and yet somehow I go through my day without ever focusing on Christ or others. This short, easy read will help refocus your thoughts and heart as you are reminded that this life is not about you, but rather the one you were created by. I would recommend this book!"
3,"good, but lacking","I really enjoy Max Lucado, however I was sightly disappointed with this book. I guess I was looking for a little bit more direction from it, however, I would still recommend it to others as it did make some good points!"
4,Not About Me,"I just finished reviewing ""It's Not About Me"" by Max Lucado. If you've been reading my personal blog you have seen at least one excerpt from this book (expect more in the future!). I'm a huge fan of Max Lucado and this book was the perfect example of why I love him.His writing style is so simple and straight-forward. What he says just makes sense. And it makes you want to do something. Take action. And he makes it seem so easy! I loved how easy it was to read this book. The writing style is so down-to-earth but Lucado fills up the book with so much wisdom. This is the kind of book that makes you think and makes you want to be a better person and a better Christian.I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially if you've liked Lucado's books in the past. You won't be disappointed.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."
5,It's Not About Me,"I cannot think of another book which is more needed today in this world of self-centered materialism and instant gratification, which everyone of us is susceptible. There is no one like Max Lacado to get to the heart of a spiritual/psychological/emotional issue. Not only does Rev Lacado have a way with words, he expresses our innermost feelings and is able to help us put our finger on those nebulous feelings we could not quite pin down, much less admit to. He points out that we all struggle with insecurity and the self-life, but that there is a solution in The One who gave His All for us. I have personally experienced that ""There is power in the name of Jesus"". This is a book that can be reread every now and then, as we all need to get our perspective and our priorities back in order from time to time."
3,Quick Read....some good points,"It's Not About Me was a good read in that it was quick, short chapters, and some really good material. Although I'm not a big fan of Max Lucado, this book reminded me that my life isn't about me and my selfish objectives. My life is about God and how he plans to use me for his glory. I think it's a great book for someone who might be on a new walk with Christ and needs some guidance on what that's all about."
5,It's Not About Me,"An Awesome Book! Highly recommend to one and all readers! Max Lucado is a wonderful writer, I will be purchasing more of his books!"
3,It's okay,"So, Max Lucado is not my all time favorite author. I like a book that keeps me thinking for a long time and his generally don't. I will say there have been seasons in my life when I've really appreciated his work. He's a heart author. Need reminded God loves you? Max Lucado. Need peace in your storm? Max Lucado. I'm too much of a thinker for a steady diet of that, but I will say this book probably applies more to me than his others. We all can use a reminder that a life lived for Christ is not about us. I needed the reminder to see people through His eyes. I needed a gentle nudge from a Savior that what I'm doing, however insignificant it may seem at the time, it important through the lens of eternity. True peace is found in daily sacrifice of all we are for all of Him. Living our lives for an audience of One."
5,It's Not About Me,"It's Not About Me Rescue From the Life We Thought Would Make Us HappyBy Max Lucado. I received this book from [...] to review a few short weeks ago. It's a short, easy read that flows easily with scripture reference, songs of praise and prayer.""To seek God's glory is to pray"" is a reminder that we just need to stop, look and listen for God's grace and gifts. By praying we are not only talking to God, but we are praising Him at the same time. Promote God, declare his preeminence.One of the best parts about the book is the study guide in the back. This book can easily be used for small group bible study and discussion.This book is a treasure."
5,Wonderful book!,We are using this book in our Sunday School and have had some great discussions! Definitely recommend it to other groups.
3,A disappointed Lucado fan,"I am a big Max Lucado fan. I have read most of his books and I have found them very encouraging and challenging. But I have to say that this latest book is very disappointing. From the start, the hardback version is printed in huge letters, like a children's book. A poor effort! The written material was also poor. What a wonderful subject to write about. There was the chance for Lucado to reach down into this topic of our lives revolving around God and teach us so much. The whole Bible is about this theme!! I am sorry Max but you let us all down with this book. It appears a book written when you had some spare time rather than something written with passion and conviction. On this topic I would turn to Oswald Chambers, DL Moody or JI Packer."
3,It's Okay,"I really like Max Lucado and his writing. This particular book just seems to be ""lightweight."" to me."
4,It's All About GOD!,"""It's Not About Me"" is a title with a simple purpose: to realize that life does not revolve around us. Instead, we are remember that God is our Maker and He has the right to do what He wants and we are to submit to His agenda for our lives.Some of the important points include:1. Our struggles can be used for God's glory.2. Our bodies belong to God and we should not abuse them.3. Our salvation depends on His grace instead of our self-effort.4. We are to reflect God's glory in our lives.5. We are to ""promote"" God instead of ourselves.Lucado writes in a clear style that gracefully challenges the reader to think outside of him/herself.A good read that will encourage you to be more God-centered and others-centered and less about being self-centered.Read and enjoy! Recommended."
5,IT'S NOT ABOUT ME,This is a very awesome book. Changed my life so much that I read it twice..most likely read it again in a few months...
4,An album of adult lullabys.,"Music for tourists- Chris Garneau (whimsical pop album)Songwriter Chris Garneau excels at creating a lullaby-esque genre, while incorporating a zealous chord-driven piano and swaying instrumentals-bass, cello, french horn, percussion. His voice is like a less convicting Damien Rice, full of whispery singing; but still while the sound is pretty, the lyrics do provide wrenching meanings. The music is soft and constant, but rocks all the same. I suggest tracks 1,8,12,13. It's kinda funny track five talks about hamburger helper. Also covers Elliot Smith's ""Between the Bars"", which is absolutely not comparable. His lyrics are also pretty emo-indie, a little dismal, but adds to the quality."
5,Lovely Music,"This is a great album that I can totally chill out to. I listened to this album on a trip to Germany which was quite ironic because the name of the album is ""Music for Tourists"". I would recommend checking out Chris Garneau's myspace page to get a feel for his music before you purchase it. It may not be for everyone...but I thoroughly enjoy his music."
3,This is an OK game,"I have had this game for a little while and I haven't even gotten to the third level! Basically you go around and fight the guards, they are almost impossible to beat! You get passwords for the thirteen levels and you can play it in 6 different languages. Overall it is an okay game if you are looking for something that will take you a long time to beat!"
1,Too hard,"I couldn't even beat the training area! Then I go to level 1 and find that I have no sword! The stupid game put a boss in before I had found the sword! Another problem is the controls. I pushed every button but still could not jump! The guy could climb and had 2 buttons for running, but he could not jump! He fell off a ledge and died. Avoid this game and it's technical issues"
5,anarchy in bedrock twitch twitch,classic!!!!! i've loved this band since i was a little kid there cd cerial killer[based off this tape] was the first cd i ever boughtand my only wish is for amazon to get it on dvd
1,Dumb Buy,"I had watched a few songs from this online and thought they were hilarious. I bought the vhs thinking it would all be funny, I was wrong. Only funny in 91 and even then weird. 90s feel if you like that but overall awful. The Vhs I got didnt even have cereal killer music video in it which sucked worse because that was the only one i really enjoyed."
5,Wild Huckleberry Honey,This product was purchased for my Grandaughter who loves the honey. I had purhased the first bottlewhen I was out west and gave it to her for a gift. So I was happy to find the honey on-line. Great honey!Great on-line find!I will be purchasing another bottle as she just asked me for another bottle.Thanks!!
2,This Flavored Honey is Peculiar,It really appears that the purveyor of this honey simply poured some huckleberry juice into a standard jar of honey. The consistency is really off-putting. If you can imagine trying to mix a liquid into honey--it doesn't really blend. It is lumpy partly very runny and part thick. Yuck. My impression was that this is the kind of product sold on highway food stops and I don't think it's up to Amazon's standards.
3,Not the best but interesting enough to keep me watching,"3 stars because it was just interesting enough to keep me watching till the end. Most of the acting was OK with the exception of the female lead whose acting was terrible! Her expressions were very stiff and she looked like she was just trying to look pretty in all the scenes. Also, there were some very hokie parts <warning spoiler!!>, like when the villain took the female lead hostage at knife point...that is, at blunt butter knife point! Tell me, how could anyone watch this supposedly serious and climactic scene and not burst out laughing? I watched the Chinese-dubbed version, so can't comment on the Chinese acting in the original Korean version. If you have time to waste, watch it. If you have better things to do, skip it."
3,Green Rose Review,I liked parts of the movie but it was long and in some places boring. Because it was so long the music finally won me over.
3,MY GRADE: B minus to B.,"A former girlfriend introduced me to the author, who goes by several other pen names.Her books are quite short but tend to be well-paced. Additionally, she is very accurate Historically, so, unlike GLADIATOR or BRAVEHEART, movies which I love but which are not accurate, you are getting a good coverage of what you missed in school.Story follows the life of William the Conqueror, starting with his father's rise to power, William's birth and then an internal struggle. We then follow his path as he gets a wife by beating her for insulting him, his dealings with the English, his invasion and then his holding of the realms.Like Henry II, upon his death bed, his servants take off with all his wealth.STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HISTORICAL INFO: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; WHEN READ: Jan. 2006 (revised review mid October 2012); OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B."
5,Great story!,"Jean Plaidy is an excellent author. She manages to make you fascinated with all the characters in the story--from its hero William the Conqueror, to his worthy adversary Harold Godwinsson. A must-read for a historical fiction buffs."
1,THIS IS NOT SAM AND DAVE!!!!...,...this is nothing but sound-a-like singers doing Sam and Daves song -- I'm really disappointed. I still love Sam & Dave though. Next time I'll spend a few extra bucks for the actual artist.
3,It is Sam & Dave but...,"Despite what the other reviewer says this is Sam and Dave. I don't have the CD but I can tell just from listening to the clips. There are a few albums of Sam and Dave rerecording there old hits in the 70's and 80's. Some are good and some are bad. This one sounds a little funny(especially Sam's voice which seems unnaturally high, even for him) but it does have some good cover tunes, which is at least better than bad remakes of their 60's hits. It's cheap. Might be worth listening to."
5,Excellent Tutorial,"Well written and extensively illustrated with drawings and color photos; you won't find many books more complete or as detailed as this one. Good lessons on perspective, texture, light and shadow, carving depth and levels, as well as a beautiful gallery of work completed by the author.My only complaint with the book is the lack of extra projects included with it. In addition to the step by step project in the tutorial, the back of the book has only one one additional project. A larger variety of additional projects would be nice to keep the momentum going, and for those who would prefer something other than seascapes."
3,just one?,"While this book does go into some detail it only encapsulates one real relief carving. There are many examples from which the authors could have chosen but they selected one, extremely complex example from which to work. A more graduated lesson might have been in order to accommodate a more realistic learning curve."
2,Disapointed,"Being new to relief carving maybe my opion doesn't carry much weight, but I find that this book is over rated and very over priced. Had I known it's content I would not have purchased it."
2,"Dull, Dulll, Dull","The first fifty pages of this novel were so boring and obsucure, it made me wonder if it was some sort of a test of reader commitment imposed by the author. Fortunately, the story does pick up after that; unfortunately, not by my much. The author coveys the period accurately, the main character is pretty well drawn, and the story of the Scottish bubble is interesting. But, the plot unfolds at a glaciel pace and only intermittently comes to life. The mood is often dour. I kept waiting for a big payoff that never came."
5,An extraordinary literary accomplishment,"It is hard to believe that this is Mr Galbreath's 1st novel. The style is often reminiscient of Dickens, and his prose is quite successful at evoking the flavor of 1698 Scotland and the physical travails of life in the Isthmus of Panama. While the book is the story of some 2000 Scots who set off to establish a trading colony, the handful of characters central to the plot are developed with power and precision. This is a book well worth reading, and one that you will remember for years to come."
3,Impressive and disappointing at the same time.,"Not bad for a debut novel as Galbreath has good descriptive powers. However, the narrative tends to drag on and none of the characters really shine. There is some humor but overall a sense of impending doom throughout, and rightly so, since this is an account of the now obscure and tragically failed Scottish attempt to launch a colonial trading empire in Panama at Darien in the 1690s."
4,Good Historical Fiction,"I am almost finished with this book, and have enjoyed it a great deal. Well written, with a great eye for detail. The main character is likable but hardly perfect--very believable. Similar to Patrick O'Brian in setting, but without the nautical focus. And this was an incident in history I knew nothing about."
5,Arrived fast and as promised in excellant condition.,"I bought this book as a Christmas gift, and it came very quickly and in excellant condition, as it was advertised."
1,Not compatible with your average digital camera,"This website says this is compatible with all HP PhotoSmart models. That is a lie. It is not compatible with the PhotoSmarts at least through the 320 series.Maybe it's a good memory card for cameras that it's compatible with. But that I don't know, because this site lies about it being compatible with mine.So don't waste $40 believing the lies."
2,Cooling wrap,"This item is not as wide as I had thought. Be sure to look at a ruler to see how wide 6 "" is. It will not be as wide on you as the photo suggests. I got it for a knee replacement. I liked the idea that you could velcro the whole thing on be able to move around. The gel itself is fine but the material on the wrap is a light weight nylon jersey type of material which doesn't seem like it is going to hold up over the long haul. I'm also curious why my original review is not showing up. I had published one previously that was not positive and even got a phone call from someone telling me to take it down and they would send me something free. That's the first time that has ever happened. I was told that reviews are on the service and not the product which doesn't make sense."
2,compared to other elasto gel wraps,Compared to other elasto gel wraps this one does not stay cold for very long at all. I don't know if it is old but I am not happy with it at all. Normally they stay cold for hours but this one may stay cold for 30 minutes and I have to put it back in freezer.
3,"Mega Memory lacks ""Mega""","One is enticed to purchase Mega Memory by Kevin Trudeau's infomercials. However, after buying this set of 2 cassettes, I found out that this is only part of an 8 cassette course. It seems Kevin forgot to disclose that on the cover!The content of the cassettes is helpful, if not original. Kevin uses ""The Statue of Liberty"" exercise, which has been used almost verbatim in Dale Carnegie courses. Surely, it would not have been too difficult to create an equally bizarre exercise using other landmarks, characters and actions!The full program is probably better, but there may be more original programs out there."
3,A very thorough history of Prohibition,"Clark analyzes and critiques Prohibition not as a historical moment, but as a movement, originating in the 16th century. This book is very well researched and a thorough bibliography is included. An interesting aspect that is brought to light is the rural vs. urban issue of 18th and 19th century America. Overall, this text is a very good introduction to the politics of the prohibition movement."
2,Not the best game.,"Not the most challenging or easy to use game. Does not have a way to save the game, just long complex codes at different levels."
1,Incomplete,This item is of ok construction but did not ship with the back as advertized. I wouldn't purchase again.
1,Couldn't trust it,Bought it for my elderly father to use in the bathtub: it does not feel very stury and seems rather narrow depthw-wise. My mother refuses to use it. It seems very cheaply made.
1,Lousy workmanship,The connector is poorly constructed. The left and right pin to hold on to the PDA slot are very weak. The connector cannot be plugged firmly into the slot. It cannot sync properly because the connection is on for a while and then off for a while. Strongly recommend never buy it.
5,Does NOT recharge my iPAQ 3850 *FIXED PROBLEM*,Contacted Sakar Intl and they sent me replacements !!
1,Does not charge my iPAQ 3835 off a powered USB port,"I read the reviews prior to purchasing this device. Some commented the product performed as advertised. Others had trouble getting the device to charge thier iPAQ. I happen to have another USB sync/charger cable manufactured by Belkin, handy. I plugged the Belkin model into a powered USB port and it performed very well. It came with a switch which allowed one to hook up and just charge or hook up and sync. When I tried the iConcepts cable, it failed to charge my iPAQ although it did sync. I called the folks at Sakar International who produce the iConcepts' products and they admitted that my device was probably defective. They offered a replacement, but I elected to return the cord to Amazon for full reimbursement. Course, Amazon was great and even paid for the shipping, as the customer service at Amazon is always excellent. I caution folks to reconsider purchasing this product since it appears many have received defective cables."
3,ABOUT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FOR THE PRICE:,"Don't get me wrong: this isn't a bad unit...and when it comes to making waffles it works very well. The problem is the rest of the stuff it's SUPPOSED to do. The skillet part is okay if you're only creating a SINGLE omelet but it's pretty much useless for anything grander. As for grilled-cheese sandwiches: I tried it and was VERY disappointed at the results and still achieve MUCH better results using a conventional covered flat-skillet.So: as a waffle-maker, it's excellent and fairly inexpensive. For anything else? Forget it!"
4,Meditations and Awareness,"So far I am on Day 5. I like reading a short blip and then meditating with one of their mantras for ten minutes. Try to remember that Imago is the idea of eventually having a relationship and finding completeness within a relationship. They write as if during ""singleness"" a person is not complete. It can be bothersome especially if you enjoy being single. In any case, I am not one for meditating, but find these exercises interesting and valuable."
1,bigjons review,"Rainbow Six is the absolute worst game I have ever played on the game boy. the graphics are ok but the game play is terrible. The guys move terribly slow, the cpu guys are extremely dumb and never actually hit you, the planning is a waste of way too much time and the levels are extremely easy. I recomend this game only to newcomers with a lots of patience. I think it was a poor excuse of a game but oh well, I say and you can quote me ""dont waste your time and money."""
1,No comparison to the original,"Red Storm may have thought they were doing the world a favor when they released this game for the Game Boy, but is sadly quite the opposite. The gameplay is tedious and slow. The box is deceitful in appearance, in which it seems to portray a game that is fun. I only wish I'd read some of these reviews before I bought it."
2,Don't waste your money on this......,"If you are looking for the same fun gameplay as in the PC and N64 version of this game then you are in for a big surprise, this game is a stinker. The pre-game graphics look cool but there really is no point to any of it because all of the characters and selectable weapons are the same. There isn't much difference between characters and weapons. Gameplay is lousy. It's very slow and boring; you spend most of your time walking around looking for your objective with no action occurring. Just don't spend your money on this game if you are looking for a game with a challenge and good looking graphics."
3,Not that bad,"I've played rainbow six on pc, play station and gameboy. I found the gameboy version to allow you to do more things than the playstation but not as much as the pc version. If you like planning missions, giving teams assignments and strategy (vs shooting) this is a good game. There are some glitches in the AI but those were in the original. If you like first person shooters, don't buy this game."
4,dark but fun,"The game is pretty fun but you have to have perfect light to see it well enough to play right. Otherwise it has good challenge I don't like how your team and the hostages get stuck alot ,but it is a good game for a trip or when your bored would not sit and play all of the time."
1,Rainbow Six,"The fun was over when I turned the game on. Dismal graphics, poor on screen instructions, and bad design. If this were the only game out for Gameboy, well I'd take up the yo-yo."
2,A step backwards,"I liked the first two afterhours compilations, mostly because they are so downbeat and emotional. There was a concept in those albums. Now global underground (In my point of view, a very unrespectable company or ""label"") gave the opportunity to amateur computer-music geeks to become a part of what was a fine series of compilations (and good compilations are so hard to find) without using any criteria.There is a lack of criteria also at choosing unrepresentative tracks by major artists like Cinematic Orchestra and gusgus.Two stars, because I only like no more than four songs. And they're no big deal at all."
3,Great but does'nt beat Afterhours 1,"Afterhours 3 keeps to the underground appeal with diverse tracks and genres. Not as good as afterhours 1 or 2, but has memorable tracks especially on CD2. Trafik's track progressive is a dirty word is a great indication that their second up coming album is going to be one of my highlights for music this year.A great mix, but compared to afterhours 1 and 2 the main difference would be that you can dance to these CDs."
3,Still trying to get used to it,"Like many other back-pain sufferers, I've dropped a lot of coin on all sorts of medicines, gadgets, etc. and I decided to take a chance on this due to the back pain I get each morning upon awakening. The product itself is ok and does what it says, but just know that this is one of those things that will take some getting used to. Sleeping with something wrapped around your waist all night is not easy to stick with, but I can say that I notice some relief when I first lay down because it keeps my back from sagging down into the mattress. Like a lot of other things - it is hit or miss. I will keep it, but I'm not sure I'll always use it."
1,Quality stinks!,"Edit Nov 16, 2012: Changing my review because I got a new McKenzie Night Roll to replace the one I got a few years ago. I do NOT recommend this product at all.This new model stinks. It has about half the heft of the original product and flattens to almost nothing, so there's no support.---------Rec'd this yesterday, used it last night. It stayed in place while I slept. The back support kept me comfortable. This morning, I got out of bed for the first time in years without struggling or pain."
3,cheryl's review,"I think this item does what intended to a degree; however, it does seem to flatten out more in the back than I would like."
4,Provides Lower Back Support when Sleeping.....,"This Night Lumbar Roll is great for relief of lower back pain.You place it to align in the area of your lower back that would be right above where your belt would be.....It provides firm support of the lower back and seems help reinforce the natural curvature of the lower spine.It also seems to stretch the lower back muscles.It is a wonderful product that I use every night.It feels so good to sleep with when your lying flat on your back.It's like your getting you lower back massaged by providing firm pressure on your backbone.The only drawback is that it will take a while to get used to, when you turn to sleep on your side.Since this product encircles your entire waist line it puts pressure on your sides when you sleep on your side.That will take a while to get used to, but eventually you do.It is well worth it, since the product provides great lower back pain relief, when you are lying flat on your back."
1,Very disappointed,"Don't bother! I had such high hopes for this product. I sleep with rolled towels on the bed in the small of my waist and was really looking forward to trying the Night Roll. It did not work well for me. It was very thick (too large in diameter) and was very uncomfortable. Good concept, but didn't hit the mark or work for me."
1,Probably Not Necessary,"I purchased three McKenzie rolls and this one, the one for the bed, was probably overkill. I used it once and felt it was really uncomfortable. The darn thing is so large, it's too much trouble to send back."
3,Didn't Work For Me!,This device didn't work for me. My problem is when I sleep flat on my back I wake up with lower back pain. I was attempting to support by back with the night roll. That is doesn't work for me doesn't mean it won't work for your problem.
1,not for sleeping,I tried it and found it very uncomfortable to sleep in. I gave it college try but just not comfortable for me and cannot recommend it.
1,"Feels too thick, hurt more than helped","This feels way too thick to me, even though I'm not small (6'2, 180lbs). I'm a side sleeper, and I used it for 3/4 of a night and my back pain just kept getting worse and worse. I know that's not giving it much chance, but when I felt the first spasms while turning over at 4am I just couldn't continue using it. It's of a thickness that might be good for lumbar support in some chairs and I might modify it for that, but I won't be sleeping on it again."
2,Ask your doctor first,"Everyone's condition is different and many problems can be exacerbated by doing the wrong thing. I bought this item before I checked with my doctor and like a few of the reviewers here, I ended up getting more injured. Ask your doctor about your condition and what he or she would recommend to help you get a full night's rest. He or she may recommend this pillow, or they may tell you to stay clear. You don't want to add a few extra days or weeks to your recovery due to a lack of due diligence."
2,hurts more than helps,"maybe it's just my type of problem - my pelvic bones are not level, but this seems to hurt me more than help me."
4,The authors' names,I read this book as a student at George Washington University. The authors' names as listed are incorrect: They are Wilson E. Schmidt and Jack Behrman. Please correct.
2,Save Your Money,"Bonus Pack arrived today: Adapter O.K., Lens Cloth worthnothing ,Extra Memory next to useless, Bag is ... and camera barely fits in. No room for extra memory or cloth much less adapter. Buy a larger, stronger bag, adapter and save money. Piece of lintless cotton cloth will do for lens cleaner."
1,What's In This?,"I would love to review this item. However, I won't buy it because you haven't told us what is in it. I think Amazon needs to review this item first!"
1,Kodak Digital Camera Bonus Pack,I might like to purchase this item IF I knew what was included in the bonus pack. I have the camera and I am looking for accessories to go with it.
5,Perfect Halloween Party CD!,"Here is the perfect party music for young trick-or-treaters, and one that grown-ups will enjoy too. It's a great mix of fun, upbeat and playfully spooky songs that my 9 year old daughter and friends absolutely love. I searched extensively for some fresh and exciting Halloween music to replace my tired old stand-bys, and I couldn't be happier with this choice. The songs are original, clever and catchy--not creepy or too scary--just a lot of fun and very danceable! Suitable for the youngest, but a blast for older kids too. If you want to get your spooksters pumped up for the big night, I highly recommend this CD! -- Happy Mom"
4,Pretty cool,"Good collection of Halloween songs. I especially liked Victor R. Vampire. He sounds like the ""true goods."""
1,This is NOT an RPG! again this is NOT an RPG!!!!,"i wish i could give this game a negitive rating! i bought this game for ... at KBtoys about a year ago thinking it would be a RPG like the quest for N64! It is not an RPG!!!!! its a stupid puzzle game identical as dig dug! if you like dig dug maybe you'll like this game! if you think its an RPG DO NOT BUY!!!!! also the price amazon is giving for this game is also not right! NINTENDO online store sell it for only ... they must have mixed this one up with the other QUEST called QUEST Brians jurney! that one ""IS"" an RPG! this one is just crap! be carefull! i warned you!"
1,Not a great choice...,"I bought this game completely by chance at a buy-and-sell game store and it was a huge dissapointment. Nobody really expects anything from the old gameboy games anymore, but this one was particularly bad. It's kind of like Pak Man with less dots. It really shouldn't be classified as a RPG (it's a insult really). If you don't already own it, you're not missing anything. Keep your money and go buy a good RPG game. Like Golden Sun."
4,yummy taffy,Shipping was in a timely fashion. Package was not damaged. Product was fresh and affordable. Would prefer to have smaller package so I could get a variety of flavors.
5,THE source for early Dylan info,"I grew up on the Mesabi Range within 25 miles of Hibbing, Dylan's boyhood home. I've been a fan of his for 26 years. This is the definitive book on his early years. Full of photographs, some never before published, this book covers all aspects of his youth...his faith, his family, his town, his friends, and how he grew into who he became. Delightful reading for the true Dylan freak!"
2,UGH!,"This workout video was very frustrating. The point of having a workout with baby video is to workout with baby! The tape starts with a warm-up that doesn't include baby. If I had the time to workout without baby I would of bought another video! Also, your baby must not be mobile! My daughter is 9 months old and doesn't sit still long enough to make many of the exercises possible. The biggest dissappointment was that I could not return the video once it was opened!"
5,Great song,"One More Chance is a great song. Initially, I only bought this track out of curiosity since I am a fan of his father's, but I really liked this song."
5,# 1,"I first heard this song a couple of weeks ago on the radio, and I though that it was good. The other day I saw him perform it at the Winterfest Parade in Miami, where he was the grand marshall. He is really cool, he has a good voice. It wouldn't surprise me to see this song go to the top."
1,Not so good,"I don't see how this guy got a recording deal. He has a very weak voice and not much stage presence. This song isn't even very good. Julio Jr. should be very thankful that he has an extremely talented father and brother, otherwise no one would have noticed him."
1,Not That Great,"I was hoping the fires were real. One was virtual, and the music to three out of four were anxiety producing. Bad choice of music. I just turn off the music and watch the fires. three fires were real but you could not watch them start to finish. Just one time slot of a fire."
3,"Nice bag - Too small for my 1/4"" thick mat","This bag is well made and stylish enough, however, it was too small for my 1/4"" mat. I tried and tried to make it fit, and though I was able to finally get my mat in the bag, the bag would not zip. The color of the bag in the picture is a little misleading, as well. I'd read other reviews that noted this, but thought ""Oh, it'll be fine"". The color is not really tan, or khaki, as it appears in the picture... it's more of a peach. It looks like the flesh colored crayon in a box of Crayola's. Not an ugly color, just not how it appears online. I could have dealt with it if my mat had fit.Needless to say, I returned the bag.I will say again, though, if your bag is not as thick as mine, this bag is very nice for the price. Put together well, helps the environment by being made out of recycled materials, has a nice strap and is stylish enough."
1,Wasted my money,"I was very disappointed with this bag. It seemed like it would be a good investment, in particular from this company. Wrestling with the bag after a good yoga session could have undone all the peace and comfort I had just gained. I abandoned it immediately and would not even offer to give it away to a friend who is embarking on a yoga experience. The return policy will keep me from buying this type of product through Amazon."
3,"Strong performances, weak material","This disjointed work is clearly not up to the best of Kander & Ebb (Cabaret, Chicago), but is saved by the powerhouse performances of Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli. Chita's solos and the duets between the two are strong, but the rest doesn't follow through. Still, the first three songs are gems--although I'm partial to Karen Ziemba's recording of ""Colored Lights"" on the masterful ""And the World Goes Round..."", which is a cabaret-style, Off-BWAY performance of Kander & Ebb's work. Minnelli tends to sound a bit ponderous with repeated listening, but there's no denying that manic Minnelli edge. Rivera, of course, is a master of the stage."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"While Chita Rivera & Liza Minnelli are clearly Broadway superstars, the 1984 musical which teamed them together, ""The Rink"", has been largely forgotten. Why? Who knows. Maybe it just got overshadowed by that season's other hits, ""La Cage aux Folles"" and ""Sunday In The Park With George"". The production, however, was nominated for several Tony Awards, including a Best Actress win for Ms. Rivera.Kander/Ebb's score may not rise to the level of their other classics (""Chicago"", ""Cabaret"", ""Kiss Of The Spider Woman""), but the score is still quite good and contains several marvelous songs.Best Tracks:Colored Lights [probably the score's most well-known song]Chief Cook And Bottle WasherWe Can Make ItThe Apple Doesn't Fall [great Rivera/Minnelli duet!]Marry Me [sung by pre-""Seinfeld"" Jason Alexander]The recording has been recently remastered, sounds terrific and gets better with each listening."
5,"Wonderful, unusual, slightly confusing plot!","This is a wonderful musical--I, too, paid a fortune for it before it came back into print on CD. Chita won a Tony award for her portrayal of Anna in this musical. However, the plot is hard to figure out from this CD alone. If you want to hear more, I recommend buying the London cast as well. The female leads don't nearly match the level of Chita and Liza, but there are some additional tracks that help to explain The Rink's plot. Don't buy the London one alone, though---the singing (and acting) can't compare!"
5,I still get chills !,"I was fortunate enough to see this play several times in 1984. Even then, at the age of 12, chills ran down my spine as I listened to this story tell itself with music.Kander & Ebb are as creative as ever and Chita & Liza are so talented and powerful. You couldn't ask for a better combination. For those who don't know it already, Jason Alexander has a fabulous voice also.I wore out my record and my tape, but I was able to get the CD about a year ago.Every time I listen to The Rink, I can see the play in mind from beginning to end, just like it was yesterday, and I still get chills."
2,Not enough information,"This book did not really go into a lot of details in how to use the program. The superficial treatment of Poser was very confusing. If the book just concentrated on Poser it may have been useful. The book is a waste of money if you only had one of the programs discussed. In addition to Poser , the author talked about 3D Studio Max and Painter."
3,te aproach the program isdifferent,difrent then the others but for cd I did not find it helpfull enought as if they wanted to do because visualisation is more importanat than teaching program in cd but in generally the book was helpfull for me
3,"Functional, but not perfect","I am a little disappointed with the cable. Though the split USB and serial port functionality is a nice feature, there are plenty of nits that make me less than excited that I chose this cable. First, the connector does not fit tightly into my T2, such that if I move it at all while connected, there is a good chance it will disconnect. Next, the thing is slower than an aged snail. With arthritis. And a bad hip. I think, though, that this is a function of using the serial port and the Windows NT on my work PC than the cable itself. I much prefer to hotsync at home with Windows 2000 and the USB cradle. WARNING: the charging feature of this cable only works if the USB is connected, and only then if your USB is a ""powered port""."
4,The Slayers - Revolution,"It is The Slayers. It is fun. It is fast. It is The Slayers. A ten year layoff had no adverse effect on cast or crew. The new story is as fun and entertaining as was the previous three seasons, and better than the five movies between here and there. I place a lot in fun and entertaining because fun and entertaining is why I spend money on pasttimes like this. What do I not like about Revolution? I do not like the fact that this single story was split into ""two"" seasons, Revolution and Evolution-R. [SPOILER BIT] I do not like the fact that Lina Inverse's older sister does not finally make a live appearance. That is my difference between four stars and five. The Slayers is open for continuation and I really hope They Who Do Such Things considers this franchise worth such an effort. Do I recommend this? Oh, you bet!"
3,Yin Yoga,"Sarah Powers has put together wonderful sequences. My only complaint would be that her voice after awhile starts to irritate, it is the same tone and very slow through out the DVD. She also says some of the chinese info. incorrectly. To date Paul Grilley's Yin Yoga is by far the best. His voice is excellent. I also love Donna Helm-Yost's- Flow and Yin: A Balance Yoga Practice. Have a beautiful day :)"
4,Ahhhh---Yin Yoga,"Ms. Powers is a good guide. I enjoy her Yin section of this DVD, as she does a very good job and am pleased that she includes some thought to the Buddha's teachings as she goes along. It is only my personal opinion that her Yang section of the DVD is of a lesser quality than I was expecting from her and that is why I only gave it a four star. However, the DVD is well worth purchasing for any sincere student."
5,Loved It,"I didn't know what to expect, but I never felt as relaxed and inspired after doing yoga with this video."
3,Incredibly irritating video,I tried this DVD once and immediately resold it on Amazon. There was way too much talking and explaining in this video and no way to do a practice without having to listen to the same explanations over and over again. This made the routines unnecessarily long without having the benefit of actually doing poses. I was very disappointed with this DVD.
4,Very good but can't be used in your car.,"I would buy this course again, but I had hoped to be able to use it in my car. The course pretty much requires that you listen to the CD with the textbook in hand."
3,Too Involved,"I found the course to be very comprehensive, but a little too involved for someone who wants to get quickly familiar with language and does not want to look at the written text while hearing the CDs or tapes. For example, I would not recommend it for learning the basics of language while driving, which I have been able to do with Berlitz. The recording is strictly in Italiano, no English except for chapter headings. Bummer!"
3,CD and Book don't match!,"Although this course certainly gets you started in learning Italian, it, by no means, should be used alone. Other books, studied in tandem, are absolutely necessary. This course barely covers grammar basics, except for an extremely brief overview at the end. Most annoyingly, however, is that there are several instances when the CD and the book don't match. Sometimes words and even sentences are omitted from either the CD or the book. One example even had the wrong verb conjugation! In one instance -- lesson 39 -- the entire lesson is completely different on the CD. In other lessons, the same words and phrases are repeated ad nauseum. So, even though I can put together a simple conversation, this CD set is not enough to really learn the language. Perhaps, it's intended that way...so you buy the intermediate set next."
4,Effective learning tool to study Italian,"I used this book/CD to study Italian before a trip to Italy. I only completed the first 14 lessons (one of the 3 CD's.) I was able to make myself understood and knew all of the basics. I didn't study enough to be able to understand the replies! I wish I had done more, but recommend this book."
4,An creepy and intense chiller,For the genre this is a good one!!! Creepy and intense psychological horror. Kept my interest and at times tongue in cheek funny.
1,Wow...so bad its almost unwatchable,"What is there to say here...the film has a predictable plot, 2 dimensional characters and special effects done from K-Mart. Some films are so bad they are good...some are so bad that you just want the entire cast to disappear. This is the latter. Also, its really funny that Zac Ward (who can be fairly funny and talented) is credited here but is actually in the film for about 3 minutes total!Don't bother with this movie. My copy is probably propping up a chair leg."
1,BLAAAAAH,"Yet another Amazon.com viewer recommended disappointment! I like classic horror and I also like some modern horror. I enjoy cheesy, b rated stuff at times too but this was just lame and boring. I absolutely love when horror movies are filled with useless conversation to fill time. Hmmmm, here's a thought, ADD SOME HORROR!!! This movie was extremely tired and there was not 1 good thing about it. Apparently the other reviews are people that were in the movie, produced the movie, etc... I don't think my opinion could possibly be so different from all of these people. For instance, movies I find enjoyable and good, Friday the 13th, Halloween, House of 1,000 Corpses, Night of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead (haha), The Descent, etc...On the other hand ""Dead and Gone"" should be just that. What a total suck fest, not to mention a waste of 20.00. Not scary, not funny, not creepy, just DUMB!!"
3,"Looks great, plastic piece over screen falls out",I like how this Tuffwrap looks and it has kept my iPod free of scratches. My only problem is with the plastic piece that covers the screen. It tends to fall out from time to time.
5,Excellent,"As the prior reviewer noted, this is an excellent live recording at the beautifully rebuilt La Fenice in Venice.June Anderson has moved to Strauss roles as her voice has matured: in addition to Daphne in Venice she has performed Capriccio in Naples. She is impeccable. Her fine acting skills honed in all those ""mad scenes"" she has performed are clearly on display here. I also thought her voice blended so beautifully with Birgit Remmert. Would love to see them as Norma/Adalgisa.The orchestra sounds crisp and, unlike the prior reviewer, I did not have any problem with its tempi. I highly recommend this peformance."
1,Poorly Manufactured,"The filter was slightly warped or bent, and it would not fit in the air intake manifold. The curvature in it can be seen with the eye, but I also verified it with a level. I went to Subaru and bought one that worked for $5 more. The best part is that the one from Subaru was ""Made in the USA,"" instead of China where the Purolator one was made."
5,"A Strong 'Must Buy' for collectors, dealers, and historians!","Finally, we have a compendium of history, facts, photos, and values. Marbeth Schon has done the research for us, and now we can put this wonderful information to work. For collectors and dealers, this is a must have work of beauty and scholarship. The organization makes it a valuable reference source, while the photographs make it an invaluable reflection on the 'Art Movement' of 'American Modernism'.From the well known to the obscure 'Modernist Artists', their works and their place in history has now been beautifully documented by this wonderful research author."
1,Do not buy this keyboard --- it is worthless,"This is not worth your time or money. The keyboard is horrible, the installation instructions impossible to understand, the setup procedure does not work well. I purchased two of these, returned one immediately and found the other defective. ..."
1,Doesn't even rate 1 star,"This product is worthless. I returned it as soon as I saw how the product was designed. Everything about this product is poor; from keys that are difficult to press, to a space bar that is split, to the hinge in the middle of the keyboard that acts like a barrier to fingers that might try to cross it. Save the frustration."
2,A nice try but inadequate,"This keyboard folds up into a cassette size package, but that's its best feature. It's keys are difficult to locate and do not always make contact. It does not give sufficient support to the IPAQ PDA. But the major failing is that it is impossible to connect an IQAQ with an expansion pac to the unit. I would not purchase it again."
2,Typing terrible,"I had this keyboard and promptly returned it. While it was compact for easy transport, the keys had no feel to it. I felt I had to push each key into the keyboard to get it to enter a character on screen, not like other keyboards that has a light touch would ""click"" like a real keyboard. The only other nice thing is the price...paid... Only get this if you need a keyboard and have less money. Otherwise save up for the Targus folding keyboard."
1,Great form no substance,"The size and weight were right but the keys are too small and misplaced to be truly usable. Also, after installing the drivers correctly the keyboard did not work with my IPAQ 3835. Now I am unable to uninstall the damn drivers. Do not order this product."
1,buy at your own risk,"first, the salesperson told me it will work with my new ipaq 2215 running pocket PC2003, so i gave it a try. but i should have read these amazon comments before i do this!Guess what, no, it doesn't work. it only work immediately after a soft reset, and only under its special ""keyboard setting"" screen, not in word documents, notes, emails, not anywhere else. then, after i ran some other programs, it just stop working altogether.okay, maybe it works fine for ipaq 3800/3900, but get this: i tried to go to their website for update drivers for the new OS. Their website: ... (a taiwanese company) is no longer in service! So, even if I had a 3800/3900, i'll think twice before getting this product."
1,NOT recommended. Get a targus one if possible.,"The keybord is too small, and it is made of rubert so very difficult to type. Besides, There is no good support to the ipaq so you HAVE TO place it on a table. I would like a keyboard that can operate on my laps. All in a word, there are too many features missing that I just place it there. I finally give it away when I sell my ipaq."
5,"Deep Sea Dead is a highly entertaining tale of mystery, drama, and humor.",I enjoyed the idiosyncrasies of Pauline's character and thought that her quacky group of friends added a lot of flair to the story. This story just seemed to flow so smoothly and effortlessly that I didn't stop reading until I was finished with the whole book. I honestly can't wait to read the previous Pauline stories. I'll also be looking forward to more great stories from this talented author.TammyFallen Angel Reviews
4,Rewiev of Power Quest,"This game has a lot of action, but the big problem is that you have to wait quite a while for some things to happen. Overall this game has good graphics and charecters."
3,"Thorough, but exceedingly formal and stilted","To be fair, the subject matter is thoroughly explored -- there are no holes or ""easy ways out"" in this book.However, I kept getting distracted by the most unelegant, plodding, and totally humourless writing. Granted, one does not purchase books about ethernet for guffaws, but O'Reilly books usually are much more fun to read than this tome.I still haven't found anything as complete in one book, so I'd say get it if you need the info, but do have some strong coffee on hand."
2,Disappointing.,"Lacks detail on frame formats and frame types. For example, ARP is not covered in detail. You're not going to find out what the ARP frame type is or how long an ARP frame is by reading this book. Not a good book if you're looking to understand what is going on in a trace. Somehow Mr. Spurgeon managed to write a ""definitive guide"" without having to mention RFC once.If does contain a lot of physical layer info though."
2,CD-ROM does NOT install on Vista,"I've tried several times in many different ways (including Win XP compatibility mode) and it just won't install on Vista. What a shame, little disappointed...The dictionary itself is good though."
4,Oxford Dictionary,This dictionary was really good and fitted the description that Amazon provided. Amazon also delivered on time - actually 5 days before the estimated delivery period so that was really good. I saved quite a bit of money and was very satisfied. I'd definitely use Amazon again.
3,USB Sync/Charger,"Let me say right off that this product worked from the ""get go"". It sync'd and charged without a problem; however, when I went to remove it from my 3955, it wouldn't let go! It seems that the metal clips which hold it in place are not the best for this job.While it does the job it was intended for (sync/charge), I'll look into the same product from Belkin or Fellows."
3,You get what you pay for,"After tweaking the thing for a bit it finally worked. The first time I plugged it into my 3835 it wouldn't let go, and I had to wrestle with it for a minute or two before prying it out. I found there was plastic from the mold still attached to the connector, so I trimmed it off and tried it again, only to find it was now too loose. Finally, I pinched the connector a bit and it worked. It's tempermental, but if you don't mind messing with it it beats carrying around the OEM cradle."
4,Best Short Hikes in California's South Sierras,"This title is a good book on day hikes in the southern Sierras. Day hikes described range in length of a few miles up to one to the top of Mt Whitney. Descriptions of each trail is good with a decent map. I have two minor complaints. I wish the author rates the difficulty of the trails although some, such as Mt Whitney, are obvious. The second complaint is that the author should define creek crossing. Is there a bridge, a log, rocks to hop on, wade through the water? How difficult is it to cross the stream?"
2,Not something that would ever happen,I did not really enyoy this book It was really depressing and then when I wasnt crying I was thinking that this story would never happen and where was the author going. This book was about two people who fell in love in four days. They didnt really know each other lied to each other and then said tht they were in love and lived happy ever after. Not a book I would really bother reading. But if you need a book that talks about a fantasy life then read this story.
5,Wonderful for any age,"I received this book of days when I was 29. I am now 51 and still turn to it for inspiration on living my life to it's fullest. These women are (and were) extraordinary. I was hoping to find a new version with more stories of remarkable women, but am content to re-read these as they, interestingly, ""never grow old"" though I believe that most of the women featured are now passed on.This book is a book of days - just the months and numbered days, no Mon., Tue., Wed... so that it is as timeless as the portraits inside. The stories can teach young women not to fear getting older (as our magazines do), but to relish life and aging, and respect those older and wiser than us. Wrinkles and silver hair are a symbol of freedom for these women. May we all age so fully!"
1,...,"i am actually laughing, I'M LAUGHING SOOO HARD!! ahahahaha i just took a look at the bling bling collection *dies of laughter* omg... think again when you say BRATZ are sluts! what 16 year old would wear this?? the skirts are NOTHING!! this is so scary, i can't believe it! i know it won't sell very well. there will be lots of disappointed mothers. and other my scene's skirts are just as short as bratz. and really i see people in HIGH SCHOOL wearing things like the bratz and i guess the my scene's too... because they're making the clothes more edgier now. well i don't know what my scene's wear... the bling bling collection is just disgraceful! LOL i can't believe they would stoop so low! just to catch up with bratz ahahaha because obviously mattel would NEVER have created this if bratz didn't exist. they would still be making ballerina dolls. o gosh... do they have belly button rings?? AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA"
5,To the girl who wrote a review the last time,Please......Go away.....End the doll war......This doll is gorgeous and I love her.I have my scene club birthday Chelsea and I love her so much.And please end the doll war.I am sick about how peolpe are fighting about dolls.
1,I hate My Scene dolls,I hate My Scene dolls. They are ugly and copycaters. Get a Bratz doll instead. They are better.
5,Worth it for the screen protectors,"If you like these screen protectors (I do, but it is a matter of preference), this package is worth it. For about $[money]more than the protectors alone, you get a leather case, 4-in-1 stylus, and cleaning wipes. The case is not bad for casual use, but you can order one or two of these kits and replace your case yearly if it takes a beating."
2,"That's right, just the words.","No music here. I returned this item as it was very poor value for the money and just about all the info is freely available on the internet.Basically, this volume is pretty much a desktop publishing product: plastic binding, faded print, disappointing font/typeface selection, uninspiring graphics. At, maybe, 7 or 8 bucks this wouldn't be too much of a slap in the face, but at almost $20 one expects more depth.True, there is a dearth of decent bluegrass songbooks, so I guess there's not much of a market for these old-time songs. Most punters want something more fashionable, with contemporary lyrics. Me, I don't care a rat's ass for fashion; I wish someone would produce a real bluegrass songbook . . . and this ain't it."
2,Redbone's Greatest Songs - Come and Get Your Love,"If you're looking for Redbone's original recordings of Come and Get Your Love and Witch Queen of New Orleans, you will be very disappointed with these apparent remakes. The title is tricky - Redbone's Greatest Songs, but they are NOT the hit versions."
1,DONT BUY!!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR ""COME AND GET YOUR LOVE"" ITS A RIP OFF!!! IT SOUNDS LIKE A LAS VEGAS LOUNGE ACT!!! I JUST CONTACTED THE SELLER. LEMME FIND OUT I CANT GET MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS CRAP...."
2,not what the doctor ordered !!,"i was very dissapointed with this cd,certainly not the same cuts you hear on the radio,and the quality of the cd is very poor,constant background hiss,too bad the are not the original songs in there original format then this cd would have been a smash hit,instead it;s just worth smashing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Redbone Greatest Songs,"To be truthful I was disappointed! Not that I do not enjoy Redbone's music, it is just that the CD was not the original recording when they first began, that was actually what I was looking for. I should have listened to the CD before I purchased it. I have always been proud of Redbone and I attended their concert when they played in Edmonton in the early 70's, it was the greatest! Lolly Vegas still sings the way he always has in Maggie, but the music was not what I remember. The same applies to the rest of the CD, except for Suzi Girl. Regardless, I am looking for Redbone's Golden Classics and I will most likely enjoy it, if it is the original. Does anyone out there have this CD?"
2,weak compilation,"I too was suckered into buying this after seeing it on sale at a local shop. After playing it I thought that ""Come and Get Your Love"" sounded a bit different, but one of their other hits, ""The Witch Queen of New Orleans"" sounded very different from what I remembered. It appears that these are all re-recorded versions, and it's not clear if it's by members of the original band or not. This CD gives you zero information about the musicians or anything else other than standard songwriting credits and track times. The rest of the tracks on this VERY short CD are either lame remakes like ""Poison Ivy"" or watered down pop tunes. The only track that hints of the band's Native American origins is ""We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee."" Some actual lyrical depth to that tune, as opposed to most the other disposable stuff on here, although the remake of ""But It's All Right"" is pleasant. If you want a truly memorable and legitimate Redbone song collection, look elsewhere."
5,CD for sleep or meditation,"I use this CD when I have insomnia, or just when I ned tome quiet time for reflection and meditation. I also use it in my classroom to help my students quiet down and focus. I first heard it in a yoga class at a spa I visited and I asked the teacher for the name of the CD right after the class. The bowls are sweet sounding and the production is well done. I have loved Deuter for 25 years, since I played his cd's for my kids in utero."
5,I had Nada Himalaya 2 and so happy I also have this one,I love the sounds and vibration that come from listening to the tibetan bowls. Even my dogs love this one!
2,iConcepts Hotsync Charger,"Not impressed. Charged fine but the adapter to my iPAQ was not secure at all. Any slight motion of the cable and the pda lost connection to my computer. So, unless you plan on not bumping your cable or ipaq EVER while syncing, i'd steer away from this. Also ran into power issues with the iConcepts cradle."
3,Know What You Are Buying!,"This game is a lot like Myst. Still pictures and piont and click gameplay. You have to have great patients and nerve to enjoy this game. The graphics are simple but cool. The puzzles are sometimes to tough and you find yourself with no clue what to do next. With all it's drawbacks, Shadowgate is OK. It is very cool to be able to say you have a Myst type came for your gameboy. If there is another game you would like to buy, buy it and not this one. If you don't have any other game to buy than get this one. Honestly, it isn't that bad."
4,A good add to your library,"Back in 2000, when the series began, my wife and I became devoted fans. We looked for it on DVD but never found it. Well we finally gave up and stopped looking. Now I find it on Amazon 10 years later only to find out it was released in 2008!I think this was one of the best series of its genre produced - even by todays standards. Yancy Butler plays the roll of Pezz quite deftly and the supporting cast is awesome. When we first started watvhing the episodes I had a difficult time - because I was trying to remember the series. I finall gave up and simply started enjoying the episodes as if I were seeing them for the first time. My enjoyability went up immensely.If you remember, and enjoyed, this series then I highly recommend adding it to your library. The video quality is good but the audio provided is acceptable but sub-par by 2008 standards, I would have preferred a digital remastered 5.1 soundtrack.All said and done, I have no regrets for purchasing this set."
5,"Really good, wish there was more","I watched this show a bit during college when it was on TNT and really enjoyed it. I just finished watching the complete series and I'm still impressed. It completely sucked me in emotionally to the point where some episodes were almost unbearably tense to watch because I was afraid of the outcome. You never feel ""safe"" watching this show because odd plot twists and turns constantly crop up, defying predictions, and I knew my favorite characters could be killed (or be reborn) at any moment. It's not a show for everyone since it's comic book origins show through clearly, but I loved it."
2,DVD watcher,"I had enjoyed (the first ""season"") Witchblade when it originally aired. After rewatching on DVD, now I wonder why. It's very violent, there are way too many annoying ""artsy"" shots/cuts-edits & unnecessary strobe flashing (I don't know why directors think this is ""cool"", it's just very annoying! you can't see what's going on.) With all the fast cuts & unnecessary strobe flashing, I think it helped to accentuate the violence, & like most people (at the time it aired) I was probably just desensitized to the violence. And there's too much annoying music. Now I am sorry I bought it when I could have bought something else that was more enjoyable & entertaining. I will probably be donating this to my local thrift shop."
3,Entertaining in Parts,"Mediocre at best, Witchblade entertains in parts and is tedious in other parts. This is no Buffy, Angel, or -insert favorite fantasy adventure series here-. Some great ideas and characters are mixed with bad writing and boring episodes. One thing I did like was the twist for the second season (really original). If I like a show I can't stop watching it. That wasn't the case with Witchblade. I had to compel myself to finish the series when I had a few episodes left."
5,I was shocked....,when I got the e-mail notification today that this series was available! My husband and I had given up hope that Witchblade would be released.It IS about time!
5,Well worth the wait,"It has been a long wait for this cleverly written show. I have seen so many other shows of less caliber make it to DVD, I had also almost given up hope. Can't wait for the release date - several of us are getting together to ""introduce"" Sara and friends to those less informed. Personally, I thought Conrad Dunn was ""evil incarnate""!! Now, if they would just release ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" my collection would be complete."
2,Skip it.,"I found it very hard to sit through ever episode I watched...it was just very boring...alot of action, but no charecter plot really. I only got to the 3rd episode before I gave up on it. Too Boring!"
3,I wanted so much more,"Starting with a great premise for fans of fantasy, Witchblade didn't quite make it there. It had the gimmick and the potential characters but didn't quite carry you into it's realm."
4,Witchblade,"Would have loved to see another series made. Cool show, makes me want to check out the comic. Yancy Butler perfect as the lead character"
4,"Lots of action, questions and fun","The Witchblade is a magical weapon that may or may not be good for the wearer. During history, many people have held or tired to hold the Witchblade.However, this item selects the wearer without consulting them or providing ""how to"" instructions.The current ""owner"" is a female New York City Detective with a ""history"".The series covers her selection, learning process and use of this item.The series is fast and fun. The episodes contribute to our understanding of the Witchblade and the main characters.Be warned, this information evolves and not all of the revelations are real. This is an ACTION series and things never lag.Chases on foot, car or cycle occur early and often. Murder and other crimes are the foundation of many stories.The acting is above average. The stories are interesting. This is not a deep mystery but it is engaging.Can you watch this for almost 20 hour?Yes, it is that much fun."
4,Campy Fun,This series was on all too short a time. It's great campy fun and was an early forerunner for all the comic book character series that have followed.
4,Witchblade,"Witchblade series it is every thing that I expected. It is great. I had only seen one program, so I am glad I found the complete series ar Amazon. Thanks."
4,Great series,Having never heard of this series and being curious I brought the DVd. It is a fantastic series with lots of action and great characters!
2,witchblade review,I didn't buy this from Amazon I got from a website that gave me a huge discount on both of the 2 seasons.Honestly season 1 is pretty good and that is because it is a new thing that you are just learning about.You know according to sci-fi tv standardsIt is the 2nd season that messes things upIt is boring disjointed and nonsensical and that's saying something good aboutBuy it if have love for the character or comic but otherwise it's a waste of money
1,Nothing like the Anime comic.,"I was a fan of the comic...... There is nothing similar to it in this... They should have named the movie something else because it has nothing to do with the original ""Witchblade"". Just another cop show."
2,Witchblade DVD,"Witchblade - The Complete SeriesI never thought that I would downgrade a DVD product due to the packaging, but there is always a first time. The packaging is so poorly designed that the DVDs will barely stay in the package. When I opened it brand new, the last disk was loose in the package and fairly well scratched. It is a testament to my DVD player that it plays without a problem. I would buy this in a store and make sure you shake it gently to make sure the DVDs are not loose before you buy it. You might not luck out like I did.The episodes themselves are fairly well mastered. The special feature interviews are a little light on content but still interesting."
4,Fascinating!,"I encountered Witchblade years ago on televion in Europe and somehow I never forgot the impression it made. So many years after I ordered the complete DVD's.The serie fascinates because of (although the theme is old, the battle between good and evil) the combination of honesty, dedication, time transcending views, deliberate action taken in pursuit of the good and the idea of a 'mythical force' that balances good and evil arising when necessary.Also Sara is a wonderful actress: the embodiment of feminine power, determination and 'wisdom in action!'"
5,EXCELLENT!,I don't read comic books but I do read reviews and I bought the series because of the great reviews. Now I'm sad there were only two seasons. I love this series.
4,For Yancy Butler fans.,"Husky voiced Yancy Butler is the only reason I bought this series. The first half of the season is intriguing enough and has a compelling yearn to watch the next episode while the second half loses pace and suffers from weaker screenwriting which is probably why it never made it to a second season. Amusing character portrayed by Eric Etebari who is heavily infatuated with the heroine and basically an errand boy for a wealthy industrialist who seeks to control the ""ultimate weapon"" lends a somewhat comic flavor to the proceedings. But overall it's all about Yancy looking like an absolute fox."
4,"Some orig music missing, but still a great set","I was a little hesitant to open the set when it came once I saw the note that the set had an all new soundtrack chosen by the executive producer. I thought, ""So help me, if the pilot movie doesn't end with The Guess Who's American Woman, I'm gonna cry."" Never fear, that piece of music is as it should be. I did notice several other music choices had changed - I've really only watched my favorite episode, Thanatopsis, so far - and the music that was playing when Gabriel entered Sly's home is definitely different. Still, I'm happy overall with the set, though the dialogue doesn't seem to be mixed very well (hard to hear, and I know it wasn't on the VHS copies I have from the show's original run on TNT). I can at least get my ""Notty"" fix without worrying about wearing a videotape out. :-)"
4,Basic DVD review....,"Video quaility is very good. Sound is good as well. Nice menus and extras.4 episodes per disk, with exception of two (one had 3 episodes, last disk has 2 episodes). Small but nice pamphlet comes with the set, stating episode names for each disk.Main problem with the disks is that the music that was originally created for the series is the only music that comes with the DVD's. Copyrighted music that originally aired on TNT is not included (i.e. Crystal Method's ""Trip Like I Do"" is not included at the beginning of the first episode of the first season, as it originally aired on TNT.)The back of the DVD box says ""Features an All-New Soundtrack Selected by the Executive Producer"". Translation: They didn't pay for some of the music rights.However, I will say that the music selection to cover up the original music is not bad at all, just not exactly how it aired on TNT."
4,Finally Sarah and Ian!,"What a surprise to find an email from Amazon in my mailbox announcing the release of Witchblade. I totally agree with the person who couldn't believe the studio dragged their feet on this when lesser shows were being released daily. Well, we finally get the last laugh. I loved this show and the dysfunctional cast. I can't wait to walk down memory lane with Ian Nottingham, Sarah and that spooky white-haired guy again."
4,One of the better TV series of its time,"A good one for the collection - ahead of its time visually. It is a little less than fully coherent and fleshed out, but I thought still well ahead of other series."
4,It's Not the Comic - STILL GOOD Though,"I started this series based on some recommendations. I'd avoided it for years because I knew that it couldn't possibly live up to the comic books that I read years ago.I still knew this when I started it, but decided to give it a chance on it's own merits.There are some cheesy moments, and the special effects are not top notch, but they're still good.And the storyline is good. It's following it's own path, or only loosely following the comic book's storyline path. But this is a different format, and I think that it works for the 'tv' show it was.The characters are compelling and interesting.All in all, a good way to spend some time."
5,Witchblade-Awesome Series,"I just loved this show, when it was on TV. So sad that it had to end, and be cancelled. I was so thrilled to see this set on Amazon, I couldn't order it fast enough.If you remember the show, or just remember the character from comic books. This story is unlike others out there, I gurantee, you will enjoy watching ""Witchblade"". It is a must for those who enjoy the uncommon, unique storyline."
3,just ok,"the acting and writing is a little better than mediocre, although it does improve gradually. the concept behind the series is interesting and what motivated me to buy the DVDs but the execution wasn't as good as i expected from the other reviews."
4,Excellent Show,"If you are a fan of the comic book don't expect this show to be an exact duplicate. They get the names and places right and that's about it. If you really want to enjoy this forget the comic book and accept this as it is, a great source of entertainment. It was a truly original idea, something sorely lacking on television today. It's a shame it didn't continue another season or two.Mainly the show is about Sara Peini, a NYC police officer, and her advetures once she takes possession of an ancient artifact. Mainly of the stories border on the supernatural, but the stting is always modern day NY. Think Beauty and the Beast meets Birds of Prey."
4,Great DVD Collection,"I loved witchblade when it came out and still do, it is a great sci-fi work. Be prepared... it is pretty cheesy at times, and while the extended scenes are good, there is a reason they cut them short in the first place. I haven't gone through all the extra features but look forward to it. I am so glad it finally came out on DVD. Thrilled with purchase."
3,The series has a few high points...,"If you like sci-fy, particularly occult related story-lines, then this is worth seeing. Though there are a hand full of episodes that were well developed and thought provoking with good twists, the series was mostly very predictable and repetitious. It had great potential but unlike a comic book series where each episode is short and the artwork is a big focus, a one hour show has to deliver more detail and more character complexity to be successful. Comics can rely on great artwork and viewer imagination to fill in the blanks - a TV show doesn't have that luxury. Easy to see why it only ran one season. Throw in more special effects and perhaps some gratuitous nudity and it might have gotten a few more years out of the marginal writing."
2,"First half is fabulous! Second, not so much....","The show starts out great, and is a workable continuation of the witchblade story, if completely different from the comic. However, about halfway through they literally reset the entire plot line (we're talking, back in time none of that stuff happened reset). Sometimes this works--not here. Everything good in the first half of the show is completely ditched, and our heroine get increasingly whiny/nasty. I couldn't even finish the set after this point, which is saying a lot, considering some of the crap I sit through on a daily basis. Don't waste your money buying it."
1,Witchblade bad movie,"Poor writing,directing,acting,etc. I can actually understand why this ""wired"" show was not continued. It's extremely hard to follow there is not continuity to the story-line. There really was nothing to finish. Would not recommend this series."
2,poor workmanship,"I received two copies of the series and both had the same problem. The last disc had broken free of the holder. Don't know if this is a problem with just Amazon, as the one I subsequently purchased (in person) elsewhere did not have the same issue."
3,"Dear Mom, You're ruining my life","""This book by when you read it you can tell that Jean van Leeuwen (the author) defently know's 11 year olds, It was so simmilar as what my daughter (11) feels"" My mom would say. I think that This tells what and how an average, 11 year old feels about things. This is a well written book, an any 11 year old should read this to show, that they are not the only one. We choose this for our mother daughter book club, and I am guessing to hear a lot of good things, from the mothers mostly, but I enjoyed it and i hope you will too!"
1,Dear Mom You're Ruining My Life,"Dear Mom, You're RuiningMy LifeBy,Jean Van LeeuwenThis story is about a sixth grader Samantha Slayton who attends Farmingville Elementary School. She has many worries such as the boys like Brian Finnegan, her height tall, and the size of her feet. Her mother's a poet, her father mathematician, and her brother wins prizes for his artwork. These things really bother Sam because she thinks she doesn't have a talent.I think anyone could relate to Samantha in this book because just about everyone has problems with school.My opinion of the book is that it wasn't the best book I've read but it was a good book. I don't know what I would change if I were to change anything because if I changed anything it probably wouldn't flow right. My recommendation of this book is not very high because I didn't like it that much and nothing very interesting happens. I'd probably recommend it to anyone who likes stories about people's lives."
3,It was ok,"The men in black game was very disapointing. There were only 6 levels of play (pretty short), which makes the game easy to become boring. But even so , the grafics were great(if you don't have a GameBoyColor they aren't that good) and controls were simple enough."
2,disappionting,I was really disappointed with the MEN IN BLACK Gameboy game......the graphics were horrible and the game itself is pretty terrible
3,Review for Men in Black,"Ok, Men in black is...well...ok. Not the greatest game in my collection, but still not the worst either. It doesn't have very good graphics, and the sound quality isn't the best either. Control is suprisingly good, and replay is not much boring as the first time. Overall, it's OK.Game Ratings for Men in BlackGraphics 2/5Sound 3/5Control 4/5Gameplay 3/5Replay 3/5Overall 3/5"
1,Incredible emptyness,"I bought this add on (it is not cheap) thinking that I would fly specific missions with a little of avionics like the Stuka (a slow plane, but very agile and with a clear job in bombing ships, armor, etc.). But -- on my surprise -- nothing of this happens. There is no specific campaign, only you can choose between different models of Stukas, but they all fly the same, as any other plane. The scenery of Berlin and airports, etc. is poorness himself. This is a very dissapointing piece. It is very different from the very good add ons of Abacus that have missions, campaign, scenery and different planes each one with specific characteristics (The zeros, by example are zeros, the B17s, P51, FW190, P47s, and others all are very different planes. This add? on is so bad that I did not install it in the new computer. In the old I installed it, but nearly didn't use it. All this is very difficult to understand, but happens."
3,Frankie and Anette strike again,"You really can't go wrong with Keenan Wynn owning a surfing monkey. Or for that matter, Frankie Avalon cashing in on the British invasion by playing a pop sensation named after a crop-destroying insect--the accent alone is worth the price of admission. Don Rickles is no Morey Amsterdam, but hey, who is? Check out the guest appearance by ""little"" Stevie Wonder (was he ever really that thin?). Overall a must-see for A.I.P. fans and lovers of fine American schlock."
4,That's it! That's right! All the girls are bikini clad.,"BIKINI BEACH is the second best of the series, with BEACH BLANKET BINGO taking the top honors. The wide screen is filled with lovably idiotic characters doing lovably idiotic things. I love these films. Bring on Von Zipper!"
5,Maybe the best...,"This album offers both first time recordings and a high quality, warm sound that may help you to feel Satie's free-from-tricks music. As it says in the booklet, you don't need to be a virtuoso to play Satie but you have to understand the certian state of mind. The Magic of Satie is probably the best choice for both old and new Satie listeners."
3,I may be too harsh but this was a disappointment,"I purchased this CD to replace a favorite tape that had worn out of nearly the same collection of Satie pieces. The music is great but Thibaudet plays it without the upbeat enthusiasm that makes the music magic. Sorry, Thibaudet."
4,Thibaudet Makes This Album Sing,"Satie's compositions are eclectic and captivating. But the mastery of Jean-Yves Thibaudet brings them to life. His measured performance of each piece speaks to his patience at conveying a interpretation of Satie that is, in my opinion, without equal. I like Satie's music, but I suggest Jean-Yves' rendering makes it even better."
1,This fried my motherboard!!,Do not buy it. I wish I never needed a serial port. Now I don't need a serial port for the computer because SYBA's card fried my motherboard. I don't make unsubstantiated claims. I just want to save you the heartache.
4,GREAT PSYCHOBILLY FROM DETROIT !!,"A great CD from Detroit Psychobilly band. Stand out songs on this are Mors ex Supra,Graveyard Tree and V8 Nightmare.The sound is good and the musicianship is good. If you want a decent CD to add to your Psychobilly collection,this would be a good choice.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the short running time, a little over 20 minutes. But aside from that it is an excellent CD."
5,Jim Stafford,"Jim Stafford - Greatest HitsHas some classic good songs like ""My Girl Bill"", ""Spiders And Snakes"", and ""Wildwood Weed""!"
3,Got some holes,"Notably missing is Swamp Witch and the song from his only famous video, Bits and Pieces (seen on Michael Nesmith's ""Television Parts"")... but there are other collections here which omit Cow Patti and this one has it."
4,If you never played tetris you are not a gamer,Whatta ya want! Its Tetris with flashy graphics a gajillion modes of play and the ability to challenge your block stacking skills against a slew of random tetris fans via your dc and its modem. I think its better than it has ever been even though this game is meant for short spurts of gameplay you will find yourself wasting hours on this one. If tetris ever captured your attention you should buy this one it will bring back fond memories and provide countless new ones.
5,Mishima in a good mood?,"I've been a fan of Yukio Mishima since I first heard of him and watched the film version of Mishima: Life in Four Chapters. I have friends who say he is too morbid, although I find his work deep, serious, it is also fascinating. In this collection, there is actually some bright spots, I even laughed during the first play. My old version of this book was regular paperback size, yellowed, and deteriorating. So I happily bought this newly reprinted version.There are five plays presented here of different topics and settings, but all are interesting. I wish there were more English translations of his works, I've read them all and want to read more."
1,Good luck ordering this,"Good luck trying to order this book through amazon, it took longer than a month for amazon to get back to me after ordering this to explain that they could not find a way to get it and ship it."
1,"Cheap, Poor quality cable.","This cable really doesn't compare to the real nikon cable. The cable broke after one use!!!!!!! One of the welds broke. Would not recommend this cable, unless you're really broke. Buy a real nikon one on e-bay."
1,Pathetic Aftermarket Flash Cable,"This cable only worked intermittently soon after I purchased it. I took the head apart to find that the cable didn't have an effective strain relief. There is only a wire clamped over the cable to keep it from being pulled out of the adapter but there is nothing to keep it from being pushed in, which weakens and shorts the very small wires that are soldered to the pc board. An absolutely pathetic design from a physical standpoint."
1,cdm,"Adorama Off-Camera iTTL Coiled Flash Cord (3-Ft Max) for Nikon CamerasI Would not recommend this product as after I placed it on my Nikon D200, I could not get it off the hot shoe. I finally had to pry it off with a screwdriver. It made deep scratches in my hot shoe. I have ordered a similar product made by Nikon. Stay away from this product unless you plan on leaving it on your camera permanently."
1,avoid,"The price was good, but the product is lousy. The cable stopped working after only a few uses. That's why there is no warranty."
1,NOOOO!!!!!!!,"This movie is a complete waste of everyone's time. To anyone who is a movie buff such as I would say the same thing. It has a stupid plot and there isn't much of a conflict to keep the watcher interested. Honestly, if you really want to see this movie, wait until it comes on tv because you really shouldn't waste your money on it."
4,Light Amusing Comedy,"Friends and Family is the story of two gay men who work for the mafia. When one man's father (an FBI agent), comes to town, the guys must pretend to be caterers in order to prevent trouble. But all is not what it seems, and this film culminates in an elaborate feast with several different groups trying to trick eachother.While I enjoyed Friends and Family, I found the main couple lacked chemistry. If possible, they were just TOO good looking. The pair looked like they belonged in an advertisement for GQ rather than in the mafia. (I'd much prefer a more homely pair with stronger acting talents), I did think the actor who portrayed the mafia boss, did an excellent job, and the cooking scene and the scenes with the drag queens were amusing.Overall, this movie reminds me of a combination of ""Wedding Banquet and the Bird Cage."" Fun, light comedy, but nothing too original."
3,Ya just gotta go with it ....,"A trifle really and a sometimes awkward one at that. But, if you let yourself give in to the really absurd premise, you will find some real laughs and a few delightfully madcap moments. Performances are fine across the board (pick you favorite NY stage actor) and production values are good. Worth a spin in the dvd player."
3,An ok movie,I really did like this movie. But like most of reviewers I was upset that the guy couple not once showed any affection towards one another. Other than that it was a fun movie!
3,An interesting idea that fell short of its goal,"""Friends and Family"" is an interesting premise. A cross between ""The Sopranos"" and ""La Cage Au Folles"", the cover boasted. The writing, however, lets the actors down. And there wasn't a lot of chemistry between the two lead actors, who were little more than eye candy. I think the biggest problem for me was the way to story flowed...whoever edited this movie didn't do a very good job. Being that this film came from the people behind ""Sordid Lives"", I was expecting a lot more than this movie offered. ""Sordid Lives"" was a laugh a minute and was full of great characters. In this film, you don't really find yourself rooting for anyone. Mildly entertaining but not worth adding to your dvd collection."
2,Chewing the Scenery,"The premise is pretty good: a gay couple afraid to reveal to the parents, not that they are gay (everybody, including the Don, seems to be fine with that), but that they're hitmen for the mob. And some of the dialogue is clever. But most of the film is way over the top, particularly the rather childish subplot about the Indiana militia; and the gangsters who camp it up as cater-waiters are more embarrassing than anything else. There is also very little visible chemistry between the two leading men. On a more technical level, there are lots of problems with coherent narrative lines. The Great American Gay Movie this definitely is not. Keep looking!"
3,Fun but plays to stereotypes,"The movie's about two homosexual hitmen and how they live as such under an Italian mob boss. The main plot of the movie is about how they live as such while trying to remain closeted to their parents. All this amongst a big wedding party while militia-type folk from the ""unsophisticated"" country-side try to crash the whole thing. I give it 3.5/5. Fun and entertaining and not to be taken too seriously. Certainly no academy award winner here. I do want emphasize the laughs and fun. I do want to comment on how the film plays to gay stereotypes. That's probably a bad thing but if the movie were to get too serious and lose the stereotypes, the movie might lose its lite relaxed feel."
2,Expected More....Got Less,"As this was coming from the 'Sordid Lives' team and got reasonable theatrical reviews, I was really looking forward to owning this movie. I have to say it was a total disappointment. They could have done way more with the storyline than they did, instead of which we end up with a farce that is only occasionally funny. It's also a shame that the few laughs in this film are at the expense of stereotypical 'flaming' Marys ! While the two main characters are masculine enough, their relationship is secondary to straight men....playing gay and going totally over the top."
4,classic comedy gone modern,"I really love this movie. The two main characters being gay aside, it's a classic comedy of errors. By the time of the party, almost everyone is hiding something from someone else, and it's all hilarious as the lies and craziness comes tumbling down. Really, it's the kind of comedy Cary Grant performed in movies like ""Operation Petticoat"" or ""I Was a Male War Bride""."
2,"I'll pass, thanks","Star Wars Episode One Racer is a highly addictive game, but addictive is noe necessarily a good thing. The graphics are good, for GBC, bu this game is just like most other GBC racers, this only offers get-in-1st-and-win gameplay, which I personally am not a big fan of. But for others who do enjoy the repeatative and, well, boring pace that this game offers, get this game, but for those who like fun, look elsewhere."
5,COOL BABY!,This game is really cool! You get to race people from other planets! This is a high-speed fun adventure!
5,Awesome GameBoy Game!,"This is the best Game Boy Color game I have ever played in my life! The graphics are excellent, considering the graphical limits placed on the system. The sound is awesome, and I like the rumble pack that is included with the game. It has a great replay value, and the game play never really gets boring. The only thing I had trouble with was the tight turns, but even here it wasn't really a problem. Anyone who is a Star Wars fan, looking for a good GBC game, or buying for little kids should buy this game!"
2,You Should Be able to...,"Pod racing is a good game because you have a good veiw ,and it has good graphics.The problem is you cannot turn well at all. Some turns it is impossible to make! Also, you can't get power ups. I would not reccomend this game to anyone who just likes to play the game for the fun, and not other things like graphics and speed of the game."
1,Teet Tweet,Tries to bedazzle with meetings with aliens but never lets you know what they said. Heart wrenching account of childhhood. Unfortunately most of the book reads like twitter.
5,everything I hoped,"I love international music that fuses divergent styles, but often it comes out noisy, unharmonious or off balance. This is a perfect blend of two of my favorite types of music. Tends toward the quiet and meditative, rather than rowdy or danceable, but it's not bland wallpaper music, either."
1,Dash kit,Purchased this item for my 1998 Pontiac Firebird and it fit into dash perfect and the stereo fit into the mount perfect. Very easy installation.
1,Useless for MAC,"I bought this as an alternative to the expensive PalmConnect adapter, for my Vx. The driver works with System 8.6, very shaky with OS.9, extension conflicts in OS.9.2.2, and it doesn't support OS.X.The support is none existing."
1,Good luck getting it to work with Mac OS 10.2 or above.,"Make sure you can find version 1.0.4 of the PL-2303 driver from iConcepts before buying this adapter. The version which ships with the adapter is an older version and won't work with Mac OS 10.2. BTW, good luck finding version 1.0.4 of the driver. I found hits through google saying the driver was available at some point from iConcepts, but it's not there now (Their support site sucks too). Piece of advice, do not buy this adapter if plugging onto a Mac running 10.2. It's not worth the hassle.Now I have an adapter which doesn't do anything but look pretty. It'll work fine with the classic environment and probably all the Microsoft OS's but does absolutely nothing with Mac 10.2."
1,No XP driver = worthless,"This product does not have a driver for Windows XP, which makes it a very [costly] paperweight. Customer support said to use the Windows 2000 driver and it would work, but they were wrong. When they get a working driver for XP I think this product may be worth something."
1,"Poor product, worst support!","This product did not work. It did not convert my Palm Vx serial cable to USB, allowing me to sync with my new Mac iBook.Worse yet, the crudely printed instructions contained inaccuracies and the support email address is not accurate. To complete the picture, they do not answer their phones and when I reached someone in sales by email, they have not responded past the original (non-technical) response.A disaster and waste of money for me!"
1,Absolutely Horrible! Do not buy for Macs!,This product's manuals were absolutely the worst. It refuses to work with my iBook and I can't even find the proper tech support information. I'd recommend buying the official Palm version instead!
3,Mac OS X 10.2+ driver found!,"The missing driver that makes this piece of work, well, work on Mac OS X 10.2.+ can be found here:http://www.sakarhelp.com/support/select.php?step=3&category;_id=2&subcategory;_id=8&product;_id=60446"
1,Worthless for Mac,"I wish I'd looked on Amazon.com prior to buying. Local computer supermarket was selling these on sale and I had been needing to sync my Palm to my Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.2. Unfortunately, as the other reviews have stated, this doesn't work at all :( Just wanted to help bring this product's rating shockingly low so that Mac users can beware. For keyword indexing purposes, this device has a problem with mac os x, does not work on powerbook, nothing happens when you plug it into a mac."
5,A Great Game for Seniors & Senior Centers!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased 2 games.. One for myself and one for the seniors at the senior center I attend. The price was just right! They and I just LOVED it. For some it brought back memories, for others it was a fun, easy and enjoyable game. The boards are large enough to be read, durable and the chips are a fun color. For some it's like light gambling. Since I only bought the small pack and more people want to play next time, a friend ordered the DELUX game with 24 cards that same evening at home. Thanks AMAZON for all three games. It's a game that will give and give for a long Time. And we have hours and hours of play until we get tired,whether at home or at the senior center.L. Olayiwola"
4,Awesome game for the family!,I've played this game with my family practically all my life. Until now we still had the original game we started playing with over 20 years ago!!! It never gets old and it's great for holidays or family gatherings!
5,Finally!!!,"Finally,I have been looking all over the place for POKENO. My family and I use to play this game all the time. I so love this game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has never played. And the fact that the shipping time was excellent didn't hurt either!!!!! If you are debating weather you want to get this game or not stop torturing yourself and just get the game."
5,Original Pokeno Card Game,This is a great game. Our social club play this game all the time. It is easy to understand and a lot of fun.
3,Some duplicate sets received,"I ordered 5 or 6 of these sets for a a senior citizen recreational program. Some of the sets had identical cards, so there would be up to 5 winners for 1 game. They had to improvise and ask trivia questions or determine some other way to break the tie because of this (I ordered enough sets for about 50-60 people)."
3,Regular Set,I was disappointed. I did get a good product. I was expecting a Jumbo Pokeno set(as advertised).
5,A master piece of translation,"I walked into Standford University bookstore on Sunday afternoon and saw the translation of 'Diary of a Madman'. I flipped through the pages and saw the short story 'Ah Q - real story' so I grabbed one book just to see the translation. As a student grew up in Taiwan, I knew Lu Xun's stories in Chinese well in high school. Actually even some of his work was in high school Chinese Literature curriculum. But I could not put it down until I finished reading the translation of 'Ah Q - real story'.It is really a masterpiece in translation. The translator is both master in Chinese and English. I like the introductions, a foreigner's introduction about an author is more in reality, dealing both success and failure of Mr. Lu's life. Besides, as the translator said he tried to imagine what Mr. Lu would said if his native language is English. He really captured the essence of it. I really like it. It is a great way to know English style from an Engineer major point of view."
5,Buy and Keep It!,"I started reading Deborah Smith's work with BLUE WILLOW, and from there, moved backward in time to her other books. Both MIRACLE and BLUE WILLOW have a permanent place on my bookshelves, and I doubt I'll ever loan them out, either, since I'd be afraid to lose them. Even now, I sometime reread portions just as one would revisit a good friend. This book has been out a while, so at some point it's likely to go out of print, which will be too bad. It's a long and satisfying romantic tale of suffering, renewal, and redemption, with believable characters, deeply rooted passion, and a well-researched plot and setting. It is not the sort of book that one reads in one setting; plan on giving it the time it deserves. If you like a full-bodied romantic novel that leaves you feeling like you've shared a part of the characters' lives and loves, buy this book and keep it."
5,Truly a great read!!!,"After reading ON BEAR MOUNTAIN, I decided to read more of Deborah Smith's books. I had no idea when I started MIRACLE that I would be unable to put it down until the following afternoon when I reached the end. It is not filled with sappy weak characters. Instead, the book deals with characters who are dealt strong emotional blows and their struggle to overcome them. Sure, in the end they are stronger and wiser, but, hey, don't we all need a happy ending in this day and time? It is how they get there that makes this book worth reading."
3,Worth reading,"This book is dramatic and sad most of the time. Actually, it's quite unrealistic because there is always something going wrong. When the main characters get close and things seem to be working out, the author kills someone off and it gets depressing again. But, it can get pretty emotional and sweet. I think it's a good read. A few minor flaws were that: there were an amazing amount of typos in my copy. That doesn't take away from the story, but I would think they could come up with better editing. The sex is not very descriptive, which is a plus to some and a minus to others. I thought if they tried to put it in at all, it should be quality. And the story goes around in circles sometimes, using the same setup or material more than once. I didn't notice while I was actually reading, but I did when I thought about it afterward. This book is worth trying. I got into the book, and got a little teary at times. I recommend borrowing it, not buying it."
5,I LOVED this book!,"I loved ""Crossroads Cafe"" by Deborah Smith, the first book I ever read by this author. So I wanted to see what else she had to offer and ended up reading ""Miracle"". I loved this one, too! Loved the characters, the story--all the humor/tragedy wrapped up in a well-written novel. Looking forward to discovering more of Smith's work."
1,Story went in too many directions,"There was no real bond between the hero and heroine. She showed no loyalty and slept with his best friend. I think I counted 19 people dying in the story. Everyone dies: her father, his brother, his father, his mother, his child, his patient, his wife's 5 miscarriages. Yikes! Oh and get this: they haven't seen each other in 10 years. When they finally get back together, she gets a stomach virus and gets sick. So much for a moving love story.The author had no direction and no focus. There was far too much going on with other characters and their previous lives. The ending was as disappointing as the stomach virus. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,It's OK,Disappointing because I absolutely loved the first Zen Connection - will try to give it more of a chance but end up skipping the songs when they appear on my ipod shuffle.
2,Disappointment,"Besides feeling like chaulk and not very wintergreen minty tasting the mints do last a bit longer than you would think. The little pieces of fiber get on my nerves, too."
3,Review of Scale and Chord Guide for Keyboards,I think this is good to have on hand when you're working with music and you're not sure of a particular chord. It's kind of like an encyclopedia. It has already come in handy for me.
3,Simple But Excellent Guide,"Excellent book for beginners through intermediate hobbyist. Unlike Macfarren and other Scale Manuals with 100+ pages of daunting scale exercises, this book graphically and clearly explains Circle of Keys and chord construction. Great little book to keep by piano and use as guide to scale warmup at beginning of practice!"
2,Commentary,I was somewhat disapppointed with this. It was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a concise chord chart-I did not find this extremely helpful in returning me to my music.
3,Very useful,"Although I did not have too much time to pratice with it it seems to be a good reference for getting some acqaintment to the various chors and their combination you need to know to achieve nice ""Voicings"". A lot of work fir thos who really want it but this book helps."
4,A fine story for horse lovers,"Well I was a horse-loving kid so read almost any horse-related story I could get my hands on. This is one I first read in my childhood, and later went on to read to my own son.The story is about Sidi, a young bedouin arab boy, and his Arabian colt. There is a lot of fascinating information about the life of the bedouin tribes in the Egyptian deserts, and about the raising of the colt - and later adventures in Cairo as the story heats up.As a booklover I find it so sad that wonderful stories like this fall out of print and vanish. This is a great read and one that any horse-loving child would probably enjoy, and other children as well. I still have my childhood copy of this book and have no intentions of selling it! Some day I may read it to my grandchildren."
3,Tribute to Marvin Gaye,"Anyone who's familiar with ""Let's Get it On"" knows why the red skull cap is significant. That's why I bought it. It's really, really hot to wear, but I will wear it and sing ""Sexual Healing"" whenever I want. If you're into MPG, go get this."
5,Most of Us are Called to the Lay Apostolate,"Sometimes, it feels as though this incredible doucument had never been written. Its clear guidance on the laity's role in the world is timely & desperately needed: ""The inviolability of the person which is a reflection of the absolute inviolability of God finds its primary and fundamental expression in the inviolability of human life. Above all, the common outcry, which is justly made on behalf of human rights -- for example, the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture -- is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination....The human being is entitled to such rights, in every phase of development, from conception until natural death; and in every condition, whether healthy or sick, whole or handicapped, rich or poor"" (38)."
4,Very Refreshing...,As an adult I found the book difficult to put down. I think both young and old would enjoy the adventures of these young orphans. It's one of the best books I've read in a long time.
4,Great Tosh,"This is essential Peter Tosh. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because its not quite as good as ""Legalize It,"" ""Equal Rights,"" and ""Complete Captured Live,"" which are all 5 star albums. There are a couple songs that I skip, like ""Moses - The Prophet"" and ""Creation,"" but the rest of the songs are highly enjoyable. The best songs in my opinion are ""I'm The Toughest,"" ""Soon Come,"" ""Bush Doctor,"" and ""Dem Ha Fe Get A Beatin'."" This is Peter's second album with the rhythm twins, Sly Dunbar (drums) and Robbie Shakespear (bass). If you like other Peter Tosh albums (like those listed above), don't hesitate to buy this. If you haven't heard any Tosh yet, try ""Complete Captured Live"" and then the others that I listed. This album is awesome, and you should own it if you like reggae music."
4,Summerslam,"Okay heres a rundown1- RTC vs 2 Cool/ Rikishi- not much - 4/102- X Pac vs Road dogg- actually a good match - 6/103- Chyna/ Latino Heat vs Trish/ Val Venis- trish tries wrestling, doesn'y work - 3/104- Tazz vs King- ok - 4/105- Blackman vs Shane O Mac- some seriously SICK bumps here - 7/106- Benoit vs Jericho- great match - 7/107- TLC Match- Hardyz/Dudleyz/Edge&Christian-; worth the price of the whole PPV - 11/108- Taker vs Kane- two move match. punch, kick, foreign object, repeat - 3/109- Kat vs Terri thong Match- waste of time - 1/1010- Rock vs angle vs HHH WWF Title- Really good match even though Angle doesn't wrestle most of the match - 9/10PS- i'm not really a kid I'm 13"
3,Not bad but....,"I mind this wasn't a bad PPV at all, it sure have good matches.But the only real good matches were (I'm going to rate them with *)TLC match (dudleyz vs hardyz, edge & christan) ***** simply awesome, lot's of tables, bubba ray took a really good bump there, i truly recommend this match also this match was better than the triangle ladder match in WM 2000.2 out of 3 falls (Y2J vs The crippler Benoit) **** great technical match between this 2 great wrestlers the only bad thing about this match was the ending.Hardcore title match (Shane Mcmahon vs Steve Blackman)*** The match itself was kinda boring, but the ending is great.3 way dance for the WWF Championship (The rock vs HHH vs Kut Angle) **** the match was good very good chemistry between these performers, one of the best rock matches.Well those are the good matches"
4,great summerslam,the hardcore was awesome.the tlc was awesome.the oter matches are ok.but its worth the money
3,Mixed Emotions.,"I had mixed emotions about this PPV. There were some matches that bored the hell out of me and others that kept me at the edge of my seat and wanting to see more. The 3 worst matches were as follows: Main Event Triple Threat Title Match: Too Long, Too Boring, and it was supposed to be Kurt Angle -VS- Triple -VS- The Rock. NOT Triple H -VS- The Rock! Tazz -VS- Jerry ""The King"" Lawler- Lawlers time has come to hang up the boots. And Best 2 0ut of 3 falls- Jericho and Benoit- I fell asleep. Literally! The Best Matches were The Tables Ladders and Chairs Match: Dudleyz -VS- Edge and Christian -VS- The Hardyz, Undertaker -VS- Kane- Just to pause and see Kanes face, and The Amazing 60 foot fall by Shane McMahon in The Hardcore Title Match."
4,One of the Best PPV's of 2000,"The matches were off the hook! Very good PPv....close to a 5 but didn't get thereHardcore Championship matchShane McMahon VS. The lethal Weapon Steve BlackmanT.L.C.

4,WWF SUMMERSLAM 2000,"THIS WAS THE SECOND BEST PPV EVER, THE FIRST BEING WWF SURVIVOR SERIES 2000, BUT IT WAS THE BEST SUMMERSLAM OF ALL TIME. THIS PPV WAS PACKED WITH ACTION. THE BEST MATCH WAS THE TRIPLE THREAT MATCH FOR THE WWF CHAMPIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROCK, TRIPLE H, AND KURT ANGLE. WHAT MADE THIS MATCH REALY EXCITING WAS THE KURT ANGLE/TRIPLE H FEUD. AT THE END IT WAS THE ROCK THAT TOOK THE VICTORY. ANOTHER GOOD MATCH WAS THE TLC MATCH FOR THE TAG TEAM TITLES BETWEEN THE HARDYZ, THE DUDLEYZ, AND EDGE AND CHRISTIAN WAS LOADED WITH EXCITEMENT. THE UNDERTAKER AND KANE BATTLED TO A NO CONTEST. AT THE END OF THAT MATCH TAKER RIPPED A OFF THE MASK OF A BEATEN AND BLOODY KANE! THE BEST OF 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS MATCH WAS A CLASSIC AND X-PAC AND THE ROAD DOGG HAD A BATTLE THAT TURNED INTO A WAR. THERE ARE FIVE OTHER GOOD MATCHES IN THIS PPV. GET WWF SUMMERSLAM 2000 FOR DVD OR VHS, DON'T MISS OUT."
1,More books on Kis needed in English,"This certainly is not a book that must be read in order to be engaged in Kis's prose. There are numerous misinterpretations in this book that don't necessarilly offer a 'clear' and thorough reading of Kis; rather than that, they lead a reader into an abbysmal jungle whereby Kis is being portrayed as someone who doesn't know when he wrote his own books. Hopefully, the day when some European writers on Kis will be translated into English(especially from ex-Yugoslavian republics, naturally) is coming soon. Only then a comment that this is the best book written on Kis might become relevant. But when that times come, suchcomment would certainly be impossible. Or just stupid.If you are looking forward to finding more books on Kis, maybe the following names will be useful to you: Petar Pijanovic, Predrag Matvejevic, Jovan Delic."
2,Just not the same as it was on the old Atari,The new versions of this game lose a lot since you don't have the precise control that you had when it was on the Atari. Using a gamepad control is far different than the paddle control of old.
4,brilliant breakout,"super breakout is great. even better than the coin-op version. the other versions are great. cavity,progressive and double really are challenging. long time gamers should pick this up. new time gamers should get this also. get breakout or you just might freakout for not having this game in your collection."
2,Deceptive advertising,"From the way the sale is presented it looks like it's a retail box, but in fact all you get is the cpu, no heatsink, no fan. 1.3lbs? Seriously?"
5,Intel Xeon Processor 5110,"I use my Workstation to compile and edit home videos on DVD's, I use two processors, which are very efficient."
2,thought it was a self contained small vacuum,I didn't know I was going to have to drag out my large vacuum to use this. Was wanting a self contained motor.
3,"It does say, ""Most vacuums.""","It does technically fit my Eureka Air Speed bagless vacuum, but that's not to say it actually attaches or fits by itself. I place the attachment part into the hose of my vacuum, and as long as I hold it, it fits. This isn't such a problem for me, since I don't need to move the vacuum cleaner while I'm using this kit. I have to hold the hose, anyway, so I just hold it where it attaches. I need something for tiny jobs like my keyboards and other accessories, and it does do the trick. So I am keeping it. But I can see where it would be annoying for other users, and it would be great if the product came with a list of vacuums it is compatible with. Since you can't really hold it up to your own to judge the size, the buyer should be aware that it may not fit. It still works better for me than canned air."
3,Good dust collector,"I bought this like everyone else to avoid buting those compessed air cans. They get expensive after awhile. I really only need it to remove the dust from my computer upon receiving it I gave it a try. The hose is so long and there is to much ventilation for the hose, it takes away alot of the power of the vaccuum. The brush attachments were the most useful for collecting the dust from inside my computer. While I noticed if you block the vents you received a little more power its not enough to clean out your keyboard. I'm a little disappointed I didn't think I would lose so much power from the vaccuum. I does do the job though."
3,Micro Tools,"I ordered this to clean my pc. Only con was with the extra attachments I ordered, they are kinda cheaply made and kept slipping off the end of vacuum. But they did have an array of different ends to get into all those small areas."
5,Great accessories for your vacuum,These work so well that when I'm cleaning my desk area and my computer (for which I purchased these) I eschew the regular attachments that came with my vacuum and use these for everything!
2,Not great but manageable,"Like a previous reviewer mentioned, one of the main attachments(one that connect the vacuum to any of the small suction pieces) has holes that cannot be closed thanks to a design flaw. However, I just taped the holes and it works correctly. Another bad thing about this product is the long tube. It's very hard to take out after you've put it in any of the suction pieces. I managed to make it work for my intended purposes. Side note: I have the Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71B."
4,Worked fine,"This worked great, but it didn't fit my vacuum. I was able to do a work around and it worked fine."
5,Micro Vacuum Hose,"The product is excellent for small applications, hobbies etc..The hose supplied can be found at local hardware stores, so I'm going to replace the supplied hose with the same thing 10' long.This way you can vacuum inside your vehicle and not have to drag huge vacuum canisters into position.All of the adapters fit standard vacuums except for shopvacs directly. there are shopvac adapters that will reduce to regular size, then use these adapters to go smaller yet.Nice tools for small jobs that need vacuuming"
2,Micro Vacuum Attachment Kit,"I bought this for my dryer, but it doenst work so well as i hoped for. The lint that was in my dryer was to tick and those little things couldn't grab it. Not strong enough, maybe it will be good for other things. Not to mention i had to use duck tape to cover opening between this part coming to vacuum cleaner, if didnt have any strenght to suck things in."
5,Excellent Product!,"I purchased this product because reviews of other hand vacuum cleaners said suction is weak. There's an attachment that fits over the hose of a full-size vacuum cleaner. In this way, you'll get the power you need. The attachments are excellent for reaching in between the keys of computer keyboards, as well as tight spaces in printers and computers. What really enhances this product is the accompanying hose. It is this that will also give the ability to fit into tight spaces in printers and inside computers, especially mini desktops like the HP Pavilion. This product is excellent, especially for its price. I'm pleased I bought it and highly recommend same."
5,Top Notch product,This product works great with my VAC and really sucks the dust ect. out of my computers and keyboards. Highly recommended.
1,extremely ineffective,"I read the glowing reviews of this product with bafflement. The design is poor, with numerous large holes in part that connects to the vacuum cleaner that cannot be closed. As a result, there is almost no suction through the attachment and little dust can be picked up. There is a knob to turn that supposedly is intended to close the holes, but the holes are much bigger than the plastic covers, so this does nothing to improve suction. I will try to find, cut and fit a rubber gasket over the holes. As it stands, the product is useless."
5,"Works great, comes in a useful case, too","I bought a Eureka hand vacuum along with this attachment kit. The vacuum stores all in itself, so there's no extra pieces laying about that you can lose. This kit of attachments comes in a nice plastic carrying case, and stores away easily along with the vacuum! You know how it is with some vacuums. You have extra pieces that you have to store somewhere, then when you need it you can't find it! This kit comes in an easy-open-and-close case that can be stored away with your vacuum.Highly recommended!"
3,didn't work as I had hoped,wanted to use the tools to vacuum out my serger - sewing machine. Tools are to long and stiff to reach up and under the machine. Works great on flat surfaces. Think I expected to much out of the tools.
1,misleading,This attachment kit does not fit the Metro Vacuum that shows up on the also bought section and the buy all and save section. The attachment kit I got had round attachment ends and the vacuum had square attachment ends.
1,ODOR,THE PACKAGE HAD WHAT I WANTED BUT THE CHEMICALODOR WAS SO STRONG I HJAD TO DISCARD THE ITEMDONT KNOW WHAT CHEMICAL WAS USED TO MANUFACTURE BUTI COULDNT KEEP IN THE HOUSE OR USECAUSED EYES TO WATER AND PROBABLY DANGEROUS..JRS
1,junk,it is something you would get with bubble gum wrapers!!!!!!!!!!!! you need a better descriptuon of this item for the next person.
2,Difficult to assemble,There were no instructions/directions that came with the parts. It was very difficult to assemble - like putting a jig saw puzzle together.
1,crap,"this is NOT an adequate hose extension - the tube is too small (very small diamater) - it you are buying this for small jobs like keyboards & electronics it should work well BUT, not well for an extension hose - it is really only just a tube"
3,a few instructions would have been helpful,"I purchased this to be an attachment for our great eureka hand held vac which we earlier purchased to vac carpeted stairs. I thought this little inexpensive attachment would be handy. and it would have if I could figure out exactly how the attachments work. the coupling which you use to connect the small hose provided in this kit to your vac'c main hose, has several open slotes, holes, in it. these reduce the vacuum force to the small hose and thus attachments. the coupling does have some adjustment in size of these holes, but at its smallest setting, it significantly adversly affects the suction to the attachments. I duct taped over these slots and it works fine.maybe I don't now the proper way to connect, but a one page printed instruction sheet would have made it less of a mystery. pretty cheaply made."
1,Good idea but product does not work,like others said the holes in the adapter takes all the suction out of the cycle its a design flaw the defects the purpose
1,Adjustable vent holes would not close completely...so vacuum was weak,"The title of my review sums up my dislike for this product. I understand the need to not completely close off the vents due to risk of overheating the motor but that should be an option we should have. As such because the vented holes are still open the vacuum is so weak it can't pick up even a pin. I will try to modify the vents so it can shut off completely. FYI, I was at the Harbor Freight Tools store and found this same exact item hanging on the shelf...for the same price. Not a good buy..."
3,Works but plastic tubing stinks,I am using this on a Miele Carina canister vacuum. Fits using the adapter and seems to work well enough especially for the price. The plastic tray and tubing however have the foulest smelling stench I have ever encountered. I am confident it is toxic. I recycled the tray and set the tubing out in the sun for a week to let it out gas but it still is horrible. I am going to replace the tubing with some basic tubing from the hardware store. I think the company should switch plastics. I couldn't imagine working in the factory that makes these.
1,shouldn't have bought,don't know why i bought these attachments as it is like a mini tool chest and if you have extremely small areas its useless
5,This micro MoFo is TOO SWEET!!,"I have needed something like this kit for years and years and I am so STOKED I picked up this attachment kit!! As a professional detailer/cleaner I am amazed how useful every piece of this kit is, it does such an amazing job combined with the power of your upright. All pieces are made of a high quality plastic and comes in a generic white package which you'll want to hold on to if you have no other storage option, not to mention all the little micro pieces are just so cute in the window of the box. Seriously worth 9.99! BTW I read in a couple of reviews on here that said the plastic pieces had a very stinky and offensive odor? NO stink, I repeat, NO stink was shipped with my Micro Vacuum Attachment Kit thankfully! ~REEDSBUD~4.11~"
3,this is not a toy amazon,(in review amazon said it was a toy). ok well i bought it to clean my industrial sewing machine. the attachments dont stay on my vacuum well. the holes are too tiny to let stuff in. could have just bought my own tubing and put it on my vacuum. but its ok i am using one of their attachments for the job i bought it for. its ok. cheaper than canned air.
3,Mini vacuum attachments,I have fans everywhere for drug induced hot flashes. I purchased this set to see if I could clean the fan blades without taking them apart. The suction diminishes when attached to my hose. I can get to only part of the fan blades. I can do a better job with my tea pot brushes and my normal vacuum attachments to catch the dust.
3,Returning this item!,"I'm giving this 3 stars only because I did not read the description; when they said MICRO, it really is micro."
2,No instructions,"I was not happy that this didn’t include instructions. I had to go online and search for instructions on how to connect the attachments. You connect one end of the large nozzle to your vacuum and the other end to long hose. You then connect the small attachment to other end of hose. I used it to clean my laptop keys and it did the job. Although, I would prefer something with a few more different sized attachments. The suction depends on the power of your vacuum. Nothing spectacular. I wouldn’t pay more than ten bucks for it. But, put it in a place out of reach of children. It has small parts that can easily choke a child."
3,Doesn't work with Dyson Vacuums,"This product will fit into a Dyson Vacuum, but will not latch, so you have to hold the hoses together with one hand while using the other end for whatever you're trying to clean. Very difficult to do without losing suction."
5,So Great at reaching Small Places!,"I am a DJ, and bring my equipment into smoky bars, stuff travels a lot, it just gets filthy! I use the little brushes to clean dust and smoke residue off of internal fans and heat sinks. It's a Life and Equipment Saver!"
2,Strong Cemical Smell,"I would have given this 5 stars but the plastic chemical smell required me to purchase a new vacuum filter (shop vac), and a complete wash of the hose.For an additional $5 dollars, I could have purchased one from the big box stores - with the smell."
2,Doesnt fit Shark Navigator hose,Hose is bigger than any of the adapters in this kit. Have to attach with duct tape. Boo. Will use for now but going to find something better.
1,Worst Product I Ever Bought,When I received this item I spent about 10 min testing it and then left the attchments in the kitchen. I'd noticed a noxious odor when I first opened the package. After an hour the smell was very strong. I put the gadgets in a zip lock package and put it in the basement stairwell. When I returned 4 hours later and opened the door the smell was very strong. I put the package outside. The next morning the smell was still present in my house. Something is very wrong. It's a chemical smell that could be toxic. I'm not taking a chance with this and have disposed of the product. This item should be taken off the market.A secondary point is that the hose attachment has a circular valve to adjust the amount of vacuum. Your choices are 1/2 vent or open vent. Poor design.Bottom line is that this is badly designed and may be hazardous to your health!
1,"Vacuum Micro Attachments, 8-piece Kit",I bought this vacuum attatchment after reading the reviews hoping it would fit my vacuum. I was delighted it did. The best part I liked about what the review said was it had an adjustment to how much air you want. It doesn't work that way on mine. The holes don't close all the way so I hardly get any suction at all. When you turn the nozzle it leaves a gap. Very dissapointed in the product. I also had to use the extension for it to fit on my vacuum. I have a bissel. This was a waste of money :(
1,DON'T DO IT!,I bought this vacuum attachment after choosing to believe the good reviews.The air adjustment holes don't close and the unit does get any suction.This was a waste of money!
5,Works with my new shark rotator lift away 3-n-1 vac!,"Love this product for detailing. It stated that it worked for most vacs, and it worked out for mine!! With the hose adapter that comes with it I really believe it would work for all vacs. Amazingly low price for such a quality poduct."
1,It really does not work that well,Week sucking power so it does not get the lint out. Really need to work on the construction of this product.
3,Design flaw,"This device works well to reach crevices and crannies. However, the connector between vacuum and device has holes which lets most of the suction escape. The suction at the end of the device is not very strong."
3,Tiny for cleaning tight places.,"These attachments are truly micro for cleaning small, tight spaces. Among others, they work with the Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71B."
5,Delicious!,"If you like a coffee that is not too strong, but full of coffee flavor give this a try. Bold, but smooth!"
4,My favorite k cup,This coffee is a dark roast blend that is smooth with great flavor. The only problem I encounter when ordering is occasionaly AMAZON is out of stock or they back order it. Give yourself extra ordering time on this coffee or you will be sitting at home with an empty cup.
4,Slow shipping...great coffee,"The problem I have is how slow the shipping was on this product. Even though it states that it ships in 2 to 3 days, it's more like 2 to 3 WEEKS.other than that, the prices are good, and so is the coffee!"
5,Great Buy! Great Coffee,"The transaction when fast and the price is good, especially compared to other offers. thanks!"
4,Not bad,"As other reviewers have said, this has a nice taste, not bitter, not too strong or too weak. However I got an acidic aftertaste I do not care for, which keeps it from being a ""5"" for me. Everyone's tastes are different!"
1,too easy!!,"bought this game for my four year old son for Xmas along with the gameboy console. I thought since it was rated EC that it would be good for helping him get used to the controls as well as be educational. It was EXTREMELY EASY and moved EXTREMELY SLOW that he threw it down inside of 3 minutes! Didn't teach him anything about using the controls, nor did he learn anything!"
2,Save your money,"This thing did nothing to improve my cellphone reception. When I snapped it on, I expected to see an increase in signal strength. Occassionally, I would get an extra bar but for the most part, I can't figure out what possible benefit this antenna brings."
2,There's something missing here.,"And that is ""California Kid""! Their best, and funniest, song - and the one that caused me to race out and buy Tales of the New West back in '85. It's not listed here. Is it a typo? Is there some kind of record company conflict like the Replacements or the Call had? Without that song, this is all their 2nd best."
5,A must for any rock fan!,1st off gotta say this DVD is great. The quality is good and the band is amazing! The special features are cool too. Love the interviews with the band and behind the scenes. If you never heard of this band get this DVD you will become a fan and kick yourself for not seeing them live!
4,Triumph Triumph'd the day!,Triumph was a melodic hard rock canadianband kind of like Rush in the early daysbut never quite made it that big. Theyplayed a great show this day and it showsin the fan reaction how good they were.If you can find a copy of Baltimore 82show with lights and all buy it! Too badthey don't get the credit they deserve!
5,brilliant,you would find it difficult to get a better rock music dvd.this is a recording of a great concert from this stupendous underrated canadian rock band and one of my favourites.i give this dvd my highest possible recommendations.pick it up when you find it.
5,"Short, but incredible","I too, was one of the fortunate few to see this show live in 1983, and this DVD captures the essence of the performance nicely. Some have panned it for showing too many shots of the crowd, but that misses the point of what the US festival was all about. Sure there are crowd shots, but the performance was absolutely stunning. It's such a shame that the split was so acrimonious. Of all the reunions going on, this is one band I would love to see get back together, but that's an aside from the review. You will not be disappointed if you buy this DVD."
3,"Cute set, but not very durable.","I purchased this backpack and lunch box for my 2 1/2 year old daughter in October when she started preschool. It is a very cute set and she likes it a lot because it has Dora on it, but the lunch box already cracked on the front and basically fell apart. It was fairly obvious from the time we received it that it was not made to withstand a lot of use."
5,Excellent must have for any clinical neuroanatomy course,"This book really did make the lecture material SUPER manageable. I agree with other raters' comments: this book is not going to teach it all and is not something to just sit and read, BUT used in conjunction with a course, it may be the only supplement you need (it was for most of my class). It is full of hints on memorization and logic and is a must have. I am getting ready to start my neuro rotation and it is going to be reviewed before-hand and will come with me."
5,"great for nurses, doctors, and students","I used this book a lot to help study for my neuro nursing certification, and I use it still just to help refresh my memory on how it all works. I've been a neuro ICU nurse for a long time, but I still forget stuff and this book is a great, simple reference which also has given me great ideas on easy ways to explain and educate my patients and their families."
5,the best book for studying neuro,"When studying for my specialist in neurologic PT exam, this was the go-to resource for my study group and me. The writing and drawings are SO CLEAR on certain points that aren't well-explained in other textbooks. And because it's so concise, it's simple to carry around and reference quickly when you're studying. Like a previous reviewer said, it's not what you read that matters, it's what you remember. This book is great at helping solidify key points in your memory. I've since loaned it to 4 friends taking the exam and it's everyone's favorite neuro study guide!!"
4,pretty good,"very short book....takes about 5-6 hours to read...the CD forget it...its crap...so hard to use and unclear...and if your using this book for USMLE 1, the CD is useless...but the text will help consolidate some of the facts in FIRST AID...the depth of the material is appropriate for usmle 1...over all its a good inexpensive book...and cleared up a lot of stuff i ddin't understand in my neuro course...."
3,"Nice, but not as good as Healing Touch","Healing Touch was Nadama's swansong(s). Heart to Heart is a great CD, but not as ethereal and relaxing as Healing Touch. The ""lounge piano sound"" is the big feature here, as opposed to more of yoga-meditative-veil-of-hush that Healing Touch inspires. Still great listening, if you're in that kind of a mood. Another great CD to try along with Healing Touch is Liquid Mind's Slow World. Both should be played cautiously while operating heavy machinery!"
4,great garment,bought the flexeer womens firm control unitard for my daughter who was attending a Regeimental Ball at the university see attends. It made her feel comfortable and but together in a gown after wearing uniforms for the past 3 months. It washed well also.
5,Just what I wanted!,"This product was just what I wanted. I bought it to wear under my bridesmaid dress, but I've worn it with other things too (dress clothes and even jeans). I needed something strapless with underwire, to smooth and suck in some of my stomach, hips, and go past were my thighs rub together. It does all of that! And it's pretty comfortable, too. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone. I recommended it to my mom, and she bought one too!"
4,"Smoothing, but not for people with longer torsos.","I bought this to wear under summer dresses without revealing panty lines, and to smooth out bumps. It does a pretty good job of smoothing things out, but I feel I must always yank up the top when not using the detachable bra straps. This item would work better for someone with a shorter torso. The legs do bind a bit, but overall, it's a comfortable garment. I haven't worn it in hot weather nor have I had to use the gusset."
4,Good fit,"It was tough rating this product because the product definitely does what its suppose to do..... keeps all the flabbys nicely in place. BUT by the end of the evening I was in pain from the underwires digging into the skin. Also to ""pee"" through the little opening is next to impossible and if you're wearing this under a dress chances are you'll be drinking. So beware!"
3,Nice product...,"Nice product, but the seat should have been a ""snap"" closure seat so that it can snap open. The seat of the under garment is a slit in the material. How can someone use the bathroom without wetting themselves up?"
4,Where is the widescreen DVD???,"C'mon MGM, get on the ball and release this on widescreen DVD! Having said that, this film has a great cast. Price, Karloff, Lorre and Rathbone all play off each other extremely well, and Richard Matheson's script is pretty amusing at times. Another winner from AIP. I can't wait until MGM finally gets around to releasing the rest of Price's AIP films (especially ""The Raven"") and the rest of the beach films with Annette Funicello. The DVD's currently available in MGM's Midnight Movie series are a definite improvement over the pan and scan prints that have been available on video over the last several years. Thanks for that, but keep them coming!"
1,tuff!,This game is no good. Its so hard. you are selvester chasing after tweety. you always have to watch out for Granny & Hector. Im gona think about trading this. I just hope when Tom & jerry in infurnal escape comes out for game boy advance i hope its not as hard as this.
5,GOOD AND CHALENGING,I bought this game today at funcoland and must admit it's challenging. but don't let that stop you from buying it it is a great game which is extremely fun!!!!!
1,Moves too slow ... not very artistic,It is just changes too slowly and is very repetitive. Not much variety .... May be it is good to go to sleep with!
4,Dim-Mak,"This is a very good book. Illustrations could have been better. This book but requires reading and re-reading to understand the scientific, physiological and anatomical aspects of Dim-Mak."
4,Tall but doesn't hold as much as I had hoped,"Don't expect to store your rifle yokes in this, no room for your other stuff with those inside. I like it but wish it was wider. Overall, it looks just like the picture but don't expect huge storage or to stand up your larger cleaning cans. Is good for standing up your 4 ounce oils, etc., but everything else has to be laid on side. Nice and sturdy. Overall it's bigger than last case I had and will work for my needs. I still will need my other case for storing my larger aerosol cans."
5,Shooters Case,Perfect for cleaning your rifle and shotgun. I purchased one for myself a year ago. My brother in-law liked the setup and storage the case gives you. The only thing I can pick at is the gun holders take up too much room so you do lose some storage at the bottom of the case. It is still a great place to store all of my cleaning supplies for my hunting weapons. I would recommend this to others.
3,"Good size, interior openings disappointing in transport","This is a good size case, capable of holding plenty of cleaning tools, patches, and parts. The problem is there are openings at the bases of the handles on the trays that allow the tools to fall into the main box in transport. I've used this case three times to transport to and from the range and each time I've had to reorganize the trays afterwards. The openings are a poor design and should be altered, imo."
4,plano shooter case,I purchased this for my husband's birthday. He loves it and has found that it helps with not only storage but for ease of cleaning his guns.
5,A Stunning Book,"In most survival epics, man's battle against nature is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Here, not only do shipwrecked Americans face the ultimate tests of nature's cruelty, they must also deal with man's -- as slaves on the desert.Dean King is already an established authority on maritime literature. Consider Skeletons on the Zahara his shot across the bow. King is no longer interpreting classics of the sea, he's adding to their ranks. You won't believe what these men endure. Except King's research is so thorough you DO believe it. Every word. Halfway through you'll wonder why they don't just curl up and die. By the end you'll be cheering for them, and swelling with vicarious pride at their will to live."
3,Skeletons of the Zahara,Amazing tale of survival. Gives insight into the life and customs of the people living in the desert. I enjoyed the book very much.
2,Get me outta here!,"Make no mistake, this is well written and (as far as I know) researched book. So you can imagine my surprise when, 200 pages in, I suddenly couldn't take it anymore.I realized I was forcing myself to read this, like it was a math textbook. If other people can make it all the way through and enjoy it, good for them! I wish I could have persevered, but I grew tired of the endless plodding, the merciless heat, the horrific sun burns and relentless thirst. Ugh. I feel bad about it, but I just couldn't do it anymore."
5,The Desert As Dessert,"I read ""Skeletons On the Zahara"" last year and thought it was by far, the best book I read all year. Once I started it, I could not wait to get through each day so I could curl up with this amazing adventure as a treat after dinner. The only problem I had with this book was putting it down.There were moments of wonder, great excitement, sadness and tears too. I had to keep reminding myself that as thrilling as it was, it was true and so very remarkable. How strong we human beings are! What great writing this is! I have enjoyed giving copies of the book to friends as gifts. They've all been fascinated by it.I might add that I haven't given away my own copy because I plan to read it again - for the 3rd time! Other than Pearl Buck's ""The Good Earth"", there are few books I have reread."
5,A gripping and heroic tale of survival,The story of the 1815 wreck of the American cargo ship Commerce is a gripping and heroic tale of survival and a tribute to the human spirit. This book will grIp you until the final page and leave you exhausted and amazed at their ability to withstand a seemingly hopeless situation.
3,"Good read even with the author's imagination and ""best guesses""","This book is an entertaining read in addition to being educational regarding the time period and culture of the northern Sahara. Well worth the time and money to be sure. However, there are times (too many) where the author gives his personal opinions/best guesses/fabrications to augment factual circumstances or occurrences that take away from the strength of the content. I mean, who cares where a pig might have sat on a long boat not to mention the humans. It isn't beneficial information, certainly can't be proven, and just doesn't matter to the reader. This is just one example but there are many others when the author tries to ""imagine"" what might have been in the subjects minds as if it were researched fact. Still, this is a book worth reading...I enjoyed it."
1,Original is better,"A friendly librarian suggested I might like this book. I read it and in so doing found there is a 2000 reprint available. I bought that and far preferred James Riley's account of his sufferings to this third-person account.The original is reputed to have been one of the few books available to Abraham Lincoln as a youth and to have helped shaped his ideas about the evil of slavery.The first-hand account also includes Riley's account of a trading caravan told to him by his owner, who took him to civilization and sold him back to freedom.This tale of indescribable suffering is far more riveting and significant in the words of the man who lived through it. I recommend you read ""Sufferings in Africa"" by James Riley instead of this book."
4,Historically great....but.....,You may find that the recounting of the suffering of the characters that comprises at least 75% of this story gets old. There were enough great historical facts and information about nomadic and Arab customs that will keep you interested and afloat through that arduous middle section of the book.
3,Too Much Camel Urine,"Skeletons of the Zahara certainly has moments of high drama, and the fact that the story is (mostly) true, adds to the sense of adventure and disbelief. And the poor sailors stranded on the Western Shore of Africa could not have been treated much worse than they were. But for me, the retelling of this story suffered from the same monotony as the sailors themselves must have felt. There are lengthy passages of their travels through the desert that are too similar to other lengthy passages of their travels through the desert. This was interspersed occasionally with the graphic depiction of the devouring of an entire camel. I don't really have a weak stomach, but the numerous references to the green goo inside the camel stomach which became the main entree on the menu was a little too much even for me. Then there was the camel urine, which one and all slurped down like a nice chardonnay. Maybe I need to spend more time with the Touareg to get a better feel for things."
3,Survival!!,"I generally like these types of books, and I was not disappointed with this one. It is right up there with other survival stories I have enjoyed: Ernest Shackelton, and Two Years Before the Mast, and the Tragedy of Whaling ship Essex. It is story about a part of the world not really written about too much. The books presents a window into the culture(s) along the north west coast of africa, and the New England during the 19th century. If you liked and enjoyed the books I mentioned above you will enjoy this book. But I will say this, I enjoyed the books listed above slightly more."
3,Tedious read,"Well researched, documented, factual, but no page turner. Read for research, not pleasure. The tedium of life on the Sahara, similarity of events melting into one indistinguishable experience will leave you anxious for the book to be over. I actually had to start skipping pages due to boredom, something completely uncharacteristic for me."
5,Slavery from the View of White Men,"Captain Riley and his crew of Connecticut sailors lose their way in a fog near the Canary Islands in 1815 and are shipwrecked on the west coast of Africa north of Senegal. The Sahara desert, with all it's sandstorms and lack of water and vegetation, meets the sea where they land. They are captured and enslaved by extremely poor local Bedouin tribes, who travel by camel, sharing all they have. The Captain believes his men will perish without water and food and can do nothing but accept their fate. But he clings to the dream of collecting his scattered crew and paying a ransome to free them so they all can go home. The book he writes a few years later inspired many Americans to become abolitionists, including Abraham Lincoln. Unforgettable story."
5,It'll take your breath away,"Americans shipwrecked in 1815 and held captive by Muslim slavers in the Sahara.I was considering ordering Sufferings in Africa by James Riley and Robbins' journal: by Archibald Robbins, the two books King based his book on, but after reading this I didn't think I could stomach anymore of their suffering.The cruelty and ignorance of the arabs/islamist/muslims is stunning. How could and why would anyone be so cruel? If you don't take care of your servants how are they going to be able to continue to serve you?. These arabs were either too dumb to logic that out or just inherently vicious."
4,"Missed your train, get real","Yet unfinished, looking good. Narrative not always conscise with maps. Reads well, flows. Better connection with the actual accounts would have been appreciated"
2,Beware,"This book has been written entirely in the third person with the exception of two or three passages, it reads like an after action report. It is very repetitive in events, which make for a very monotonous read. I would recommend it to only those who are extreme survival enthusiast. This book was recommend to me by Amazon after I ordered other survival books via my Kindle."
3,"Interesting, but not particularly well writen","This is an amazing story, retold by a man who is obviously a solid historian and researcher . . . but not a great writer. I found the book interesting, but far from a page turner. The story itself is worth a read though."
5,These work great,"Got these for my husband's birthday. He's already used them, as have I. They are sturdy and have many uses. Good quality."
4,Gets the job done,This may not be gold plated or super high fancy material or even craftsmanship but it gets the job done. I required this adapter to convert a vga cable to plug into a dvi port. worked great I would recommend this product to anyone who needs something like this but doesn't want to spend a great deal of cash.
4,Adapters that do what they're meant to do.,"The build quality is good.I've already used them to convert DVI-I from my PC to the VGA on my tv, and it all worked fine."
3,Works okay,"I have a video card in my computer with a VGA connection, DVI-I connection, and HDMI connection. I had my main monitor connected through VGA. But I had a second monitor that was also VGA only, so I bought this to connect the second monitor to run two monitors side by side. It works, but when I move the mouse, the monitor connected to this adapter flickers and has horizontals strips of flickering. I can't say how it works if just used for one monitor since I didn't use it that way, but for 2 monitors, it doesn't seem to work well. It could have been my second monitor though, so I will try it again if I get a newer monitor and update.As for the quality, it seems okay. It was a cheap $3 item, so I didn't expect it to be anything spectacular. But it seems like it was new, and the part is solid (wont break easily)."
4,Works Well Enough,I purchased this adapter for my PowerBook. It does the job. Only issue is I could not get it to screw on to the back of the PowerBook. As much as I pushed the screws in it wold not hold and every so often it would come off. I bit of an inconvienence but not a big issue.
4,DVI-I Male to VGA Female Adapter,I had no problem with the item other than it turned out to be not what I needed but I think I can use somewhere else.
1,Does not work with Mac Mini DVI adapter,"This adapter does not work with DVI adapter that comes with Mac Mini. If you are getting this to connect Mac Mini to PC monitor, be aware."
3,It isn't what I thought it would be but...,"It isn't what I thought it would be, but that is not the seller's fault. I just didn't know the difference between DVI-D and DVI-I. I'll keep it. The price was low enough, so it doesn't pay to return. I bought myself an education for a low price."
5,Conversion,If you need to have two monitors hooked up to your PC this conversion connector can do the needed job
1,Does not work properly,I tried using this adapter with a KVM switch that has VGA connections. The resolutions that showed up in the screen properties settings maxed out at 1600 x 1200. The monitor that I am using is capable of up to 1920 x 1200. I tried this adapter on two different computers one running an ATI chipset and the other a NVIDIA chip set and had the same problem on both computers.I then tried connecting the adapter directly to the monitor and got no video output.
1,Mislabeled,"The picture of the product is a DVI-D, not a DVI-I adapter. They are /not/ compatible if you need a DVI-I."
1,Could have been better...,"Book is written in 1st person versions of the various people involved with the captive's training, including the captive. The writing was flat and unmoving. Very mechanical sex; not very erotic. Lots of abuse, rape, torture, which wasn't the topic i wanted to read... I was hoping for a more erotic, sensual novel. This wasn't it. An English society babe is kidnapped and sold into bondage. You get everyone's viewpoint on her training. Problem that made the book flat is that the captive never got to a point that she enjoyed the bdsm lifestyle. She constantly fought, cried, and was beaten because of her unwilliness to participate. If you like forced sex, then this is the book for you."
5,intense,"I have been in the search for a great, creative, and inspiring erotica author. Richard Manton is the one. The visual scenes that play in your head should be put on screen. I need a cigarette after every chapter. I read these at work on occasion and everyone wants me to read them aloud. This book is by far my fav though, I have read it three times so far. A must have."
2,This journey is not worth the time,"This book sorry to say was lacking in almost all respects. I found it uninteresting and repetitive. The author describes, over and over, forcible rape scenes that do not vary much at all. The story deals with the abduction and subjugation of young girls. After they are abducted they are trained to become willing sex slaves of their affluent buyers. This training consists of very similar rape scenes over and over. Even the author appears to grow tired of the limited variety he describes. Less than 50 pages into the book, he sums up another plodding rape scene by saying that it is ""best left to the readers imagination to contemplate."" Excuse me! If the reader is being encouraged to use his/her imagination than perhaps it would be best if you eliminated the purchase of this book altogether. Whatever fantasy you can come up with is surely better than this."
3,king of the ring 2000,it was ok all the other king of the rings were realy good but this one was kind of a let down to me there are still some great clasical matches like the dumpster table match . I recemmend this video to any wrestling fan

2,not a kotr of good matches but had its moments by joe brown,i only seen some highlights of da ppv which involved y2j kissing stepahine boy did i loved that moment when kurt became king kurt 4 winning da 2000 kotr and when da undertaker chokeslamed shane out of da ring into da table was a sight 2 c and da rock won da title from hhh n a tag team mainevent match with da stipulation of hhh didn't have 2 b pin 2 keep his title during da match da rock pinned vince mcmahon with a rockbottom 2 win his fifth title match which was a little confusing 2 me
5,WWF King Of The Ring-From someone who was there,"You can bet i will be one of the first to buy this one. First off, 7 matchess were not wasted on the tournament. The matches were fast paced and action packed. That's what the king of the ring event is all about, the king of the ring. The Tag Team Battle Royal was also a fast paced match-of course accompanied by the WORM! The maain event was cool personally i was going for the undertaker. The table dumpster match was a great gimmick match, but the hardcore title match, well let's face it was terrible-but Crash Holly saved the day. All in All this was a great event. You will enjoy it if you haven't already seen it. It's True, It's True."

5,THE ROCK RULES!!!!!,"I just love this ppv cause Vince said that Triple H would retain the title. Boy, was he ever wrong. This ppv was best until I saw SummerSlam 2000. I am a big Rock fan, so I was very happy when The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom and pinned him to regain the title. The King of the Ring matches were excellent as well..."
4,WWF King of the Ring 2000 Review,"I ordered this pay per view and let me tell you, I was amazed! It had a solid card except for the Hardcore Title match between Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. I loved the bump that Shane took when The Undertaker threw him onto that table. I also loved it when Vince imitated The Rock and tried to give him The People's Elbow when instead he got a Rock Bottom for his efforts. It was a very odd fashion in which The Rock won the title. That was the first time I ever saw any singles title change hands in a 6 man tag match. All in all it was a very well done card."
1,WWF KING OF THE RING 2000,"THE WWF KING OF THE RING 2000 WAS THE WORST PPV OF THE BIG FIVE. THE MAIN EVENT WAS A SIX-MAN TAG TEAM MATCH FOR THE WWF CHAMPIONSHIP. ONE TEAM WAS SHANE, VINE, AND TRIPLE H AND THE OTHER TEAM WAS KANE, UNDERTAKER, AND THE ROCK. THE PINNED VINCE TO BECOME THE WWF CHAMPION. THAT WAS THE BEST MATCH AND THAT WAS A BORE. THE KING OF THE RING TOURNAMENT WAS NOT VERY GOOD AND THE THREE OTHER MATCHES WERE TERRIBLE."
5,Good,"This ppv was not what I thought it would be. It was a very good event.The tournament itself could have been better.It was not very suspenseful. Though the fact that crash lasted as long as he did was interesting.The four corner elemination match was a let down. The table dumpster match was more interesting than I thought it would be. As for the hardcore evening gown match,I hope that I never have to see anything like it again! The king of the ring finals, was one of best matches of the ppv. The main event eas very good, except for the end.I mean the rock has been champion enough times he should have let undertaker or kane win the match but it was interesting with what happenned with Shane Mcmahon. The dvd version of this tape has some cool features. Definatly worth the money"
3,Not the Best ..But O.k,3 star ppv. The main event stroryline had a pretty good build with the Rock making sure you atlease got ur Moneys worth ..and Kurt Angle winning the King of the Ring was not all that bad the king of the ring tournament would launch Kurt Angle into the Main event stature he rightfully deserved .. And i guess the Hardcore championship match between Brisco and patterson were suppose to be somewhat Hilarious .. All in all Rock winning championship and Kurt winning the King of the Ring makes this worth the purchase
5,WWF King of the Ring 2000,"Awesome seller, will definitely deal with them again! WWF King of the Ring 2000 plays great! I absolutely have no complaints whatsoever!"

2,Overheats,"This charger could not charge the Visor without overheating after 15 minutes. Either it had to be unplugged and set aside for 10 minutes, or a fan had to be directed against it to be able to charge the Visor. The housing is poorly constructed."
1,Bad Tuner,"If you ever plan to listen to the radio, don't purchase this stereo. The tuner is analog and has difficulty staying on the selected station. Also, there are no preset stations. Zero stars for Boss, but five stars for Amazon for taking back this disappointing product."
5,Good Buy,Boss Audio 506CA in-dash cd receiver is a great buy if you just want a cd player with basic features.
4,ok?!!,i didnt buy this off of amazon but from a thrift shop for 5 dollars brand new.it worked good until the fast-forward button got pushed in but a quick pin through the button fixed that.then about a year after that it went could not hear music from the speakers but i could hear the bass.overall it worked really good for my liking.might buy another for my truck.
1,STATONS WOULD FADE IN D OUT,STATIONS WOULD FADE IN AND OUT. MAN WHO INSTALLLED IT SAID IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS A CHEAP RAIDIO/HE WAS RIGHT
1,BossAudio 506CA,"i dont like it because the buttons are too small, it does not turn up very loud, and the volume i feel should be the nod. its just awkward."
4,Boss Audio 506ca in-dash cd receiver,"the stereo is alright, how ever it its as easy to navigate.. but for what i use it for it is good. i would recommend this product to whom is just looking to play cds and their ipods... not for a custom stereo however... thanks for selling a good product to me."
1,p.o.s. Not happy NO STARS,did not work like it should .The worse radio I ever bought . Stoped useing one month after I bought it. Bad sound bad pickup and CD stoped working. JUNK
1,Spent a few dollars more and buy a better product and not this!,I got this as a gift from my wife. It worked fine for a few months thru my ipod but then the south texas summer came and it warped the detachable face so now it doesnt even work at all unless I press hard the detachable face against the dash. When it does work(seldom) the radio stations get drifting and CD player skips at the tiniest bump. Dont buy this piece of garbage.
1,Should have read the other reviews first...,"Just like everyone else said - which I didn't read until after ours started acting up - this thing jumps stations. Randomly. It's an analog radio dial with a shiny digital face. Total waste of time and money, particularly since it was a surprise for my husband's birthday and I had it installed while he was at work. Hauled tail across town to have it done, and within a week he was shopping around for a replacement unit. *sigh* I tried."
1,Waste of money,"It's not a digital tuner, it's an analog tuner with a digital display. There are no presets, and the tuning knob is so difficult to turn that it's impossible to accurately tune in a station. Amazingly, once you've found a station, the radio will occasionally untune itself slightly. Fortunately, it uninstalls almost as easily as it is installed."
1,Seriously...,"Don't bother...I would not steer you wrong. For a little more you can get a Sony, Panasonic, JVC or anything but this. And it will probably work as opposed to this piece of junk. Seriously. I'm not kidding."
3,You get what you pay for,I was very pleased with the speed of delivery. My stereo was stolen so I wanted something cheap to replace it. I had to pay double the cost of the stereo to have it installed and the tuner didn't have preset buttons. I should've caught that when I was buying it. So the stations keep fading out (static). I sold the car and she will probably replace this one quickly. All my fault! Nice stereo for dirt cheap. I like that I can take the front off.
5,Triumph at their best!,"When I first heard this show I was bown away. This Is Triumph at their absolute best! This Is the third Live album they've released with another one A Night Of Triumph coming in 2004. I would have loved to give it five stars, but if anyone has been to this show or or knows about it, they will realalize that the opening song Too Much Thinking was omited maybe do to technical problems. They also added some keyboards that was not played on the show. But all in all I highly recomend this to anyone that loves live music."
1,WHERE DOES IT DAY THAT THIS KEYBOARD IS NOT MAC COMPATIBLE?,KEYBOARD DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC 0S 9.2.2 AND BOTH WEBSITES THAT SUPPOSEDLY PROVIDE DRIVER FOR KEYBOARD ARE HORRIBLE. SO NO SUPPORT. I WASTED 37 DOLLARS FOR NOTHING. ICONCEPTS CEO MUST BE HAPPY.
1,Too Small,"I'm baffled by the description of this being a ""Full Sized Keyboard"". It most certainly isn't. The tiny keys are impossible to touch-type with, and the raised internal casing lines make it even more cramped (e.g., you can't hit the center of the space bar). All in all...it's probably a much better bet to go with the ""real"" Palm keyboard. If you're a hunt-and-peck typist, of course, this is probably fine."
3,"Small and light, but very awkward","This keyboard is smaller and lighter than most others out there but there are two major design flaws: 1) The keyboard is split in two halves with about 2/3 inch gap in between, not a problem in and of itself, except that the keys YHN, which you would expect on the right side, are on the left. This is a real pain for touch typing. 2) The space bar (also in two halves) is just above the raised edge at the bottom of the unit preventing you from pushing the space bar instinctively with your thumb (unless you are double jointed) so I ended up having to use my index finger instead. Later: I recently bought the Logitech Typeaway keyboard which overcomes these design flaws while still being small and light! Keyboard has correct letter layout and bottom edge of the unit is hinged to lay flat allowing for comfortable use of the space bar with your thumb. Definately worth the extra few bucks!"
3,iConcepts Portable Keyboard review,"Very disappointed in this product. I have a Palm M130. The keyboard works, but you have to type very slowly and press the keys hard. Basically you can only type with one finger. I had in the past the Targus keyboard for a different Palm model, and although bulkier, it worked great compared to this. Since this is one of the cheapest portable keyboard, I'm reminded of the saying, ""you get what you pay for""."
5,Same as Centric Parts 150.44102,"Looking for the short brake line from the front axle to hub on a FJ40? I have a '74 and this part will work. However, it is identical to Centric Parts 150.44102 and is (at this time) $6 more expensive. The Centric part is labeled ""Front Lower"" so I was hoping this part was from the body to the front axle, a longer hose, but as the description says it is about 8"" long and not going to work for that application.It is made out of the same brake hose as the Centric parts, here is what is written on both parts:SAE J1401 - 1/8 HL - 03/11 - DOT - SUNSONGFittings are the same for both parts, both in quality and materials. So in terms of Centric Parts 150.44102, this should be labeled: ""Front Lower"" as well. I will suggest that Amazon add this to their description so no one buys this looking for the longer hose."
5,Excellent Source Book,"This is an excellent source book for all forms of needlework. In addition to small and relatively simple designs, this book also contains numerous designs that will challange the most ardent needle-artist.As for the ""apparent"" outlandish price, this is NOT being charged by Amazon. It is a USED copy listed by a dealer/private individual under the pseudonym ""edbdbooks"".I whole heartedly recommend this book for embroiderers and appliquers as well as anyone who participates in living history, Highland games, or SCA."
5,"Bought as a present, recipient delighted :)",The happy new owner is a fan of the game. Also fast becoming an expert in it thanks to this book
5,don't buy this here,I only paid $30 for the EXACT same book on a knitting site - what is Amazon thinking!!! worth having definitely but go elsewhere to purchase it and save yourself $163!!
5,Couldn't be better,"This book has great plot. I'm a first reader of her novel, and I'll start to collect her books. This story is funny, romantis, and will make you hate to put this book down. The hero is really perfect, and so does the heroine. I can't wait to buy the next novel by Katherine Sutcliffe."
1,Please do NOT read this book,"I've read hundreds of romance novels, and come across many bad ones. This book definetly ranks amoung the worst of them. It starts out promisingly. Interesting idea and all. But it drones on and on. Why does the heroine like Clayton? Love him with out reservation? He didn't really do that much to deserve her devotion. Especially since he's spends most of the book being a first class jerk, and planning to pass her onto his brother. Yuck. Not to give anything away (though I hope if you are reading this review you do not put the effort into reading this book), in the Prologue Miracle finds out Clayton's deceit, and then the book jumps back 3 months. By the time the story has dragged itself back to the starting point, it finishes in about 10 pages. I wish Sutcliffe has spared us all by ending the book 10 pages after the Prologue. Everything inbetween is just fluff."
1,Not for adults,"This game might be a lot of fun for young kids, but it is WAY too easy and boring for adults. The only one of the 5 games that provides any challenge for an adult is Donkey Kong, and it is an extremely watered-down version. Save your money on this one and buy Donkey Kong Country."
4,Pretty good and costs less than collecting them on e-reader,"This is the second of the Game and Watch compilation series. With classics from when Nintendo first made handheld games with built in alarm clocks, you'll keep pretty busy. The games go on and on making you want to see how high of a score you can get. Still, it wont keep you too busy for long trips. They should've added just a few more games and made USEFUL special features. This is why I give it 4 stars."
5,Ratings don't mean much with this magic,What a travesty! That these unpublished gems by the great Temptations have languished away for many years says a lot about Motown and its lack of respect for these geniuses of American music. Not only do fans deserve more but the great original Temptations need to be honored and revered as the geniuses they were and will always be.Let's have more CD's...more DVD's of their performances of the composers and arrangers and choreographers etc of this great epoch in American musical traditions...so that the new generations can be awed once again by these performances.
5,Where did this guy come from?,"It's great to see that someone still writes good original music. I don't know where this guy came from, a friend turned me on to this single and I look forward to hearing some of his other songs. A solid Pop/Dance song, should do well at radio."
2,Gift,This book was purchased as a gift for a friend. I liked the lay out of the book and the recipes that were inside. I am sure that my friend is getting a great deal of use from this book.
1,The Ultimate Diabetes Cookbook,"This is a concept that doesn't make sense. Ms. Gelles gives recipes to help those with diabetes who also have heart disease and kidney disease. Everyone with diabetes should eat ""heart healthy"" and if you have kidney disease you need more help than Ms. Gelles can provide in a cookbook. Her writing makes me think she doesn't understand basic concepts of diabetes."
1,Waste Of Time,"Superficial, simple and tedious. Walker is the Danielle Steele of the forensic thriller genre."
3,Reading ease,"This book was not easy to read due to the excessive hyphenation. Words, names and places were hyphenated. Whoever reviewed the digitalization of this book and several others by the same author should be more careful. This is the only author that appears to have this problem."
3,Goodish read......,"The actual story was very interesting, but I just can't get into Jessica as a character. If you read my other reviews on this series you will see what makes me just not care about her. I suppose if you read this as a stand alone book you would enjoy it more. Perhaps if you love Jessica as a character you will really like it. For those people who are not crazy about Jessica as a character I don't think there is anything in this book to make you think any more/less of her. I would have really liked this book if it was another character and not part of this series."
4,review,The suspense was good; but it got a little long. AND I did NOT need to know that the heroine had had sex with nearly every new character introduced.
