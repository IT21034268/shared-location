1,"Hard to find a good ""NORWAY"" tour on DVD","I am a Norwegian living in the US. I bought this DVD to show it to visitors and friends here in the Memphis area. I was very disappointed after watching it the first time. The Norwegian classical music is great, but the quality of the filming is not very impressive. It is not even ""half way done"" I think. You are much better off buying a book with nice pictures and actual text in it since there is no commentary on this DVD."
1,Amateur video!,I am a Norwegian living in the US too. I bought this DVD to show it to friends and colleagues here in Oklahoma.I was very disappointed after watching it. The photographer is obviously an amateur.My grandma could have done it better!Don't buy it! It is not worth the money.You are much better off buying a book with nice pictures.
3,Why didn't it came out in sequential field format?,"I remember watching the movie at a cinema many years ago...It may be not the greatest movie, but compared to others I have seen, this one was enjoyable that first time.I can't see why they didn't release this movie in sequential field format. It would have been a lot better to watch and enjoy.If you, like me, still want to buy the DVD, be warned. The red and cyan colors on the movie are on the opposite way they should be, so if you don't have the original glasses, follow the instructions provided and wear the glasses the opposite way they should be(wear red on the right eye and cyan on the left).The movie performed acceptably well on my computer screen, but did terrible on my TV. I still could enjoy it by using a projector and the glasses with the colors inverted though."
2,"Como curiosidad, buena","Esta es el único DVD (si alguien sabe de otro, por favor avíseme) que está en 3D. Viene con dos lenges rojo-azul, los que deben ponerse al reves de como vienen rotulados (seguramente son de otra cosa).Algunas escenas se ven en 3D, otras no. Yo vi esta versión en cine con lentes polarizados, y recuerdo que los efectos eran muy buenos, y las flechas se veían salir de la pantalla. Aquí no es tanto. Quizás al ver el DVD en 30"" o más se vea mejor el efecto.Como película es mala, pero si le gusta los 3D, comprela y agreguela a la colección."
3,Ridiculous but fun 3-D film,"Originally released in 1981 in full color polarized 3-D (using clear gray glasses) this DVD presents a down-converted ""anaglyph"" version, which uses the red and blue lensed kind of glasses. The effect is not nearly as good as the theatrical version, but it is still fun. The film itself is very stupid; it has little dialogue or storyline. As you would expect from the title, the main agenda of the filmakers was to point or throw things at the camera as often as possible in 90 mins. The DVD version restores a prologue (about 8 mins) which was cut from the 1981 theatical release. The same producers and stars later gave us the not so classic ""Treasure of the Four Crowns"" (1983) also in 3-D and this one is even funnier!"
2,High expectations,"This doesn't show well on my TV, possibly from old format? But I remember it being really cool as a kid. Oh well."
2,"Entire movie 3-D iis a great idea, but bad production, doesn't work well","I just watched the show ""Medium"" Season 2 Disk 3 episode ""Still life"" that had the red/blue 3-D scenes that were awesome. I also used to own the 60s b&w; movie on vhs ""The mask"" which was freaky, but also great red/blue 3-d scenes.This one didn't work well. The red/blue was way too far from the real image so it just looks like double/triple vision. The depth works a little, but still a strain on the eyes to find the real image. The first 15 min seemed cute, but corny, like an old 60s western. The bats attacking the hostage women were so fake you could see the wires. The acting could be much better. They had a great amount of things popping out at you & the actors seemed to be having fun knowing it was a corny movie.I couldn't watch more, the reason why I got it was the 3-D & it didn't work well. Try the titles above"
2,"Funny BadMovie Sometimes Good 3-D Effects, Sometimes Not!!!","The Movie is funny, bad movie with Anthony acting like Clint Eastwood cousin, Shoot in Spain, If you want to see all the 3-d effects it's important to adjust at perfection the Tv screen.My advice : Turn down the color on the Edge to the Black&White, and turn Up the brightness (sometimes it's difficult to achieve, but believe me, it works)(be patient)The bests 3-d shotts are in general the Wide Shots, the problem is sometimes in the close ups"
2,"Good 3-D Effects, but you can set you Tv","In English : The Movie is an spaghetty western shoot in Spain, Is a bad/good movie, with Tony Anthony plays like Clint Eastwood's cousin. Well the principal atractive is to see the 3-D effects. They Work, but the most important thing is to set your Tv. The color shoul be turned down until the Edge of black and white (the red color should be only less).Another advice is to turn upo the bright of the Tv. If you see the screen more than 2 meters distance, the effect or three dimension works very well..."
2,Laborious,"Long,drawn-out and boring. Characters and events lost in non contiguous time frames. Ending contrived toto make main character content. More then this reader."
3,Does not slice the food well.,Picked this up in a second hand goods store. I'd seen the Info Commercials where Jack uses a similar device to chop raw vegetables. Thought this would do the job. But it does not slice the vegetables very well. Perhaps the blades are dull. I will take a look at sharpening them. So far the experience has been under whelming.
3,"CLAUDE BERRI, OPUS 10","*** 1981. Written and directed by Claude Berri. An unemployed decides to become a teacher. He has no special teaching methods but he loves and understands children. Nice comedy. Nice, just nice."
2,Disappointingly Few Color Images,"I bought this book to see examples of Henri's color work and found only 15 color images, not all of which were even full page plates.The balance of the book used black and white photographs with too many postage stamp-sized thumbnails. Don't bother buying this book if you want color examples of Henri's work."
5,Welcome Companions,"Fate must have meant for me to see this because I was listening to ""Destiny Blues"" from Welcome Companions when I came across this site. Songs like ""Profit off the Lord"" show good humor and skilled musicianship. I don't normally like country sounding songs, but this one is fun. Other favorites are ""Anything But This"" with Jonathan Dorsey's Byrds-style guitar work and Eric Foreman vocals. I think Jack Logan's on here somewhere, another artist who is good because he cares more about the music than slick styling and corporate packaging. Rick Fowler and the other performers are into their craft and motivated by a pure love of music, and it shows. Good stuff."
1,Another Disappointing Release From Paavo Jarvi,"Paavo Jarvi seems to be stepping outside of the composers his father, Neeme, favors, which is a good thing, but Paavo's conducting of Ravel is hardly impressive. Like his Debussy recording,Debussy: Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune; Nocturnes; Etc. [Hybrid SACD], there is just something missing here. I can't hear one bit of passion coming from Jarvi. The Cincinatti Symphony Orchestra play well, but there's just not much fire here. Am I missing something? I don't think I am. I own almost every recording of Ravel's orchestral music available.That said, the audio quality is top-notch, but this alone does not save this recording from mediocrity. Perhaps someone else will enjoy this recording, I just couldn't get into Jarvi's way with Ravel. I'll stick with Martinon, Boulez, Dutoit, and Tortelier."
1,"Caveat Emptor - it's the awful first CD master of ""Remember The Future""","Beware! Disc 1 of this release is thehorrible first CD master of ""RememberThe Future"". Allegedly, the engineerdidn't realize he or she was masteringfrom a quadrophonic mix, and just usedthe 2 front channels. The result is justatrocious - thin, guitar barely audible,an total wreck. It's easily the worstCD mastering job I have ever heard, andI've heard quite a few. That some labelexec would decide to repackage this messas part of a ""highlights"" set bogglesthe mind.This doesn't deserve even half a star,but one-star is the worst rating Amazonallows.Any CD of ""Remember The Future"" thatwas mastered prior to 2002 should beavoided at all costs."
1,Not Weatherproof!!!,"I purchased this item with great joy... it exactly matched the color of my new siding. Also, functional, nicely designed and wouldn't stand out on the front of my house. Too good to be true. Well, ""form follows function"" went out the window with this one... mail boxes are an outdoor item. I ordered it in late August - it was put up in October - in April my nephew, who is tall enough to see the top of the mailbox, noticed it was very rusty. Very, very very rusty, almost the entire top was rust. What a shame; I'm very disappointed!"
4,A compromise between looks and security for a security mailbox.,"It could be sturdier. The metal is moderately thin. Possibly, a small hand can reach in and take something from mail sticking up halfway up from the bottom. However, this is the most attractive wall mailbox for my home I've found that is also lockable."
5,Fine Mailbox,"Installed easily, although I used larger screws than those provided. It seems quite secure. As another reviewer noted, a small hand could possibly fit inside to retrieve some mail, but this would be a challenge if mounted at eye level...and anyone that serious about stealing mail could pry the box open. The opening fits magazines and almost all routine mail items. It is large and can accomodate a lot of mail, yet one of the more attractive mailboxes we've seen. The ""bronze"" finish is almost black."
3,Not what I was expecting,"Just received this last night. It is huge which detracts from the style of it. My husband's first comment was that it looks like it belongs on an apartment building, not a house. My biggest issue is that I ordered the bronze to go with our outdoor light fixtures. At least in artificial light, this item ended up appearing more of a dark gray not the deep brown tones typically associated with a bronze description. Looking into the return shipping cost, may just end up hitting it with a coat of metallic rustoleum."
3,Decent mailbox but paint is fading/chipping after 5 months,"I bought this mailbox 7 months ago. It was easy to install. The lock works fine (like others said, a little flimsy but adequate). After 4-5 months, the white paint started getting discolored. It's slightly yellow in areas now. Granted, we had a bad winter (lots of snow), so that may have had an impact, but I didn't expect paint problems - especially so soon. I just noticed that two areas are now rusting - the paint has actually chipped off the border of the top edge of the mailbox. At some point I'm going to have to repaint the mailbox myself so it doesn't look bad. I have been disappointed with how the paint held up."
3,good looks but thats all,"The mailbox looks nice, but the lock is so poor quality that it becomes a hassle to use on a day to day basis. I would not buy this mailbox. I am in the process of finding another mailbox right now."
2,Flimsy lock; paint chips; way overpriced!,"I bought this two years ago. In an earlier review (replaced by this one) I gave it four stars. Sine then, the paint has chipped off in areas around the mail slot. It's on a covered porch and does not see abuse, so should hold-up a lot better, especially given the very high price.Review from April 2010: This mailbox is fine. It's solid, attractive, plenty big and the paint job is good. The lock is surprisingly ""flimsy"", though will probably be good enough. It was a bit of a challenge to attach it to a shingled wall; a flat surface would have been much easier. Mostly, though, I feel like it was way too pricey for what it is. Should have cost half."
1,"Can you say, ""HUGE?""",I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this from Amazon... It would be very helpful if Amazon included dimensions in their description. I don't mind paying the money as long as I have the place to mount two of them on either side of the door. I don't. I notice with all the other products they offer no dimensions are included. I'm sending them back and ordering from another website -- not Amazon.
3,"Okay, but not really what it claims","The ball does not look like a real ball close up, it is hard to control, and it makes noise when it is moving. As a novelty gift, it might work, but to fool your buddies on the course, unless they are deaf, they will know what is going on immediately...still fun to see their reaction to the idea that there is such a thing as a remote control golf ball."
1,these things are horrible,they dont even go where u want them to they suc and i dont recomend buying them
4,Ooioo - 'Feather Float' (Birdman),"Whoa! This Ooioo CD really caught me off guard. Best described as good 'Japanese experimental'. Tracks here that'll keep this disc in my current rotation stack for awhile are ""Be Sure To Loop"", ""Oi3umio"",the total tripping ""1000 Frogs And 3 Sun In A House"" (gotta just love that song title) and the out-there ""Ring Ring Lee"". The vocals here may not be that great, but the over-the-top music more than makes up for it. Might appeal to some fans of Boredoms, Altered State and High Rise."
4,Good for Group Study,"I give this four stars out of five because it assumes a lot of the fundamentals from, ""Men Are from Mars, Women from Venus."" Those fundamentals are referenced and discussed, but lacks a detailed explanation of ""caves and waves"" given in the intial ground breaking book.Nonetheless, the DVD is super. I am using it in a church setting discussing effective marital counseling. This DVD helps study and discussion of gender dynamics that are often misunderstood or that needlessly become the source of difficulty within marriage. In my own pastoral experience, too many counselors miss this important understanding of gender dynamics in marriage. My only concern is that I wish it would be stated that sometimes marital difficulties are a bit more complicated -- Familial background or just plain selfishness."
3,Another 'scholarly' work,"I was disappointed in this book. Yet again we are subjected to an exhausting study of one of Napoleon's campaigns, and we are left to imagine most of it. The few maps included are simple and at a very large scale, with no troop movements to be found. There is no accounting of armies or orders of battle, and any casualty or other statistics are only mingled with the text and need to be collected and/or analyzed to verify their accuracy. The chapter endnotes are mostly bilbliographical. I was interested to see quotes from personal correspondence, which is almost unheard of, and it gives great insight into Napoleon the man as a result. Sadly, this book did not accomplish what many are longing for,,,a more detailed analysis of the Italian campaign. You'll need a few more books with more information to get a clear picture."
2,I couldn't get past the first few chapters,"This is a massive book and doubtless would repay those who can finish it. I didn't like the text. I found the first few chapters rather dreary as the author was trying to set the stage for Napoleon's foray into Italy. I didn't like feel of the book -the paper used was bad and the pictures were bad. And as for the maps? Well, the maps were cursory.I'll stick to my copy of Attack in the West and Napoleon in Italy for a clear account of this campaign."
3,Great reading but could have been better,"One of the more interesting books on Napoleonic campaigns, especially one that there haven't been too many books written about it. I found the book to be quite an enjoyable read but like most of the other people who wrote reveiws on it, what bring down the book was lousy maps. Considering the details that the author offered in the book in tracing movements, battles and all that, good maps should have been alloted all over the book. Instead there were basically generic maps in the middle of the book. It sad when I have to go to other books like West Point Atlas of Napoleonic Wars to get a clearer pictures of what the author was trying to say. Considering how familiar the author is to the entire area of operation, maybe he fell into a mind trap of thinking that everyone knows the terrains as much as he. Other then that, I don't have much more to add then what was written before."
4,"Good book, and the only major source on the subject","Studies of Napoleon's Italian campaign are hard to come by, so this book fills a very important space in Napoleonic historiography. The author does a fine job, with a large amount of detail being presented in a readable style. One comes away feeling they have gained a solid understanding of the campaign.The book could have made better it the author had carefully examined the mindset of Napoleon himself, and how he felt about everything he was doing. The book also ended rather abruptly, without a discussion of the long-term effects of Napoleon's campaign.Despite those flaws, this book was very good and should be read by anyone attempting to understand the Napoleonic period."
5,The Way of the Cross for Children,This is a good way to introduce children to pray and contemplate about how much God loves them to suffer so much for them. It is a wonderful tool for lent.
5,"Great headphones, great price","These headphones produce wonderful clear sound at a great price. Perfect for portable or computer audio. I have several headphones in this price range, and these undoubtedly produce the highest quality sound. It's sleek and well made. It combines the best of both worlds: like in-ear headphones, it's lightweight (does not produce any strain whatsoever) and does not allow noise to escape and bother those around you; like over the head headphones, it's durable and stays on securely."
4,"Great sound, poor cable","Ah, if only Sony made these headphones with a more durable cable... I'm on my 3rd pair already. I keep coming back to them because the sound quality is great and beats any 'two-pods-on-a-wire' type headphone. Unfortunately the cable is the weak point. Eventually one of the channels (or both) will start to crackle and stop working, especially if you use the headphones while jogging or during other sporting activities.These headphones are becoming increasingly difficult to find here in Europe so I was very pleased to see Amazon stocks them. I ordered two. Then I found that seller Zalmar charges 60 Euros (75 US$) to ship them to Europe! Fellow Europeans, please take note. I cancelled the sale.Still, great headphones, great sound, comfortable to wear, and if you DON'T take them jogging they'll last forever. If you want something for your daily run, look for something else."
1,don't buy these if you run with an ipod,"I've bought 3 of these and each has lasted no more than 3 months and broken in exsactly the same manner, the left ""speaker"" stops working. I use them running with an ipod and don't kinow if the running or the ipod have anything to deo with the defect, but i've bought my last pair."
4,Durable and good sound,I've owned 2-3 paris of these over the yeaers. One pair I found used at a garage sale for 50cents and the others I got new. They've neve failed me. I do not like ear buds nor the ones that go around the pass of your neck. Regular hp's are too cumbersom. Thes rule!
5,Love this Series!,"Scarecrow and Mrs. King was my favorite show growing up. I have watched it sporadically in reruns over the years as well. This year, for Valentine's Day, my wonderful husband gave me Season One on dvd, and I was hooked all over again. This show still makes me laugh, and it holds my attention just as much as it did when I watched it as a child. I love that the show is sweet, silly, and action-filled. The characters Lee and Amanda are so easy to like. I watch the episodes over and over, and I never tire of them. I cannot wait until the third and fourth seasons are released on dvd!"
5,"Please, Please, Please do not make us wait!",Please do not make us wait another year for season three and two more years for season four! Just release them already. I (and many others) are ready and willing to pay for the remainder of the series now!
5,Please get season 3 and 4 out.,I agree with the person who requested the release of seasons 3 and 4 of Scarecrow and Mrs. King. It makes no sense for the company preparing these to go so slow when the public is ready for the releases now.
5,Super.... The Best,"Scarecrow and Mrs King was the best tv show EVER! Bruce Boxleitner and Kate Jackson are super together, their chemistry on screen is amazing and one of a kind! Excellent !!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait for Season 4 to be released in Jan 2013"
4,This one was left out!,This episode was not included with the rest of the series on the free for Prime. I wanted to see all of the series so I paid to see this one. It was worth it.
4,80s love,I miss the old days of tv! Never can get enough of Lee and Amanda! Wish more of the old 80s shows like this were on Amazon Prime
4,Ridiculously Awesome!,This is a wonderful show to watch just for fun. I recommend watching it with little expectations and just enjoy it.
5,Mom loves it,Purchased for my mother who was a fan of this show. Quality is excellent. Hope they release the next season.
1,"Amazon has this under Prime Free videos, but it isn't free","Great response time for feedback, but Amazon never read the original query. Don't try to stream episode 11 season 3, the back-end code is incorrect or you will purchase this episode. Amazon doesn't understand this, they think the customer is not very bright. This episode is only available for 1-click."
5,I love this show!,Loved watching this show when growing up. So glad it's on Amazon Instant Video! Amanda King is a fun complement to Lee Stetson who thinks he knows everything there is to know about being a spy.
2,Dull,"I could not get through this book. I'm not an ex-military guy trying to relive his fantasies. The book is full of military jargon, the characters are wooden and unrealistic, and I basically couldn't care less about them."
4,Judge a CD by Its Cover,"The excellent reviews so far missed only one other redeeming part of the CD --its cover. When I bought the record album around 1970 my youngest daughter Ann said she still remembers ""the scary cover."" The record also had something the CD doesn't have ---a cover photo of the Steppenwolf band celebrating someone's birthday in a burned-out house. How's that! The music ranges from great to filler, but I agree with others that it improves over time. Like Jupiter Child ---lots of power and energy and some super drumming by the late Jerry Edmonton. And of course ""Rock Me"" which always gets me dancing. Buy this CD and work your way toward a complete collection of music by this super band ---Steppenwolf. This band got many of us through the 1960s and early 70s. Rock on! Earl Finkler"
4,unfairly underated,this is a great cd and with the big hits such as...it's never too late ....jupiter child and rock me along with the great but unheard songs such as...dont cry...chicken wolf and happy birthday (not that one! )this cd has always been my favorite and i like all of steppenwolfs original albums but this one stands out from the rest for me!
3,A good buy for sure,"This is one of the weaker albums in the Steppenwolf catalog. There are some songs that are quite good such as the opening cut, ""It's Never Too Late"" and ""Rock Me."" There are two obscure and pleasing ballads in ""Lovely Meter"" and ""She'll Be Better."" There are some other good cuts as well, however filler like ""Cat Killer"" and ""Sleeping Dreaming"" are not even developed songs, and detract from the overall punch of the disc. This album is at a very low price, so it is worth buying."
5,Steppenwolf at their best.,"This is probably Steppenwolf's most consistent record.The songs are a bit dated by today's standards ( Anti-Vietnam Rants).But, the music and the showman ship is top notch.But this CD."
3,Good fit,good fit once you put it in correctly and it also has a pocket under the radio display for your iPod or etc.
3,Turntable.,The turntable mechanism is not as smooth as it should be. I have others from years ago and the old ones turn better than the new ones.
1,You get what you pay for,I put this for use in my classroom so my kids could play scrabble and see the board correctly! It broke on the first day! I wouldn't recommend this product.
3,NOT for your camcorder!,"Excellent mike but NOT for mounting on your camcorder. Anytime you touch your camcorder to adjust exposure, zoom in-out, manual focus,etc the sound of your finger tips will be recorded on tape. Be warned. The Sony ECM-HS1,which I have used for over three years, is a much better choice. No camera handling noise is recorded, sound quality is not at par with the MS908C, but much better than the internal mike. Just leave it in the 'Shotgun' full time for best results."
4,Great little mic,"All in all, I am pleased with this mic. It works well with my Sony MiniDV Camcorder and is easy to install. The one thing I don't like is that the light indicating the battery life of the mic is covered by the foam windscreen."
4,Terrific mic for the price,"I shoot documentaries in HD. For the past 5 years I've shot in surround-sound. My rig has two of these mics isolation-mounted on the top of my camera, one facing forward and one aft. The four audio channels are independently recorded, mixed, and delivered on a DVD. When played on a home theater setup, you get all 4 channels back. Wonderful sound.That said, the frequency response is not perfectly flat, but I've measured the response and I put in a complimentary curve to compensate.All in all, a great mic. The foam windscreens help reduce wind noise only slightly; for best results, combine the foam with furry ""windjammers"" (they look like a very fuzzy mouse) to really cut the noise outdoors."
2,NOT a directional microphone!,"Put this microphone on a Canon HV20. The built in microphone has much better sound quality. Tested directionality set to 90 and 120 degrees by turning around with the camera in a 360 degree circle. There was no difference on the recording level no matter which direction the sound came from or what setting it was on. Even with the accessory bar that places the microphone a few inches away from the camera the level of noise recorded from handling the camera was as bad as the built in microphone. Maybe on a lesser camera that has a really bad microphone, the MS908C will be an improvement, but on the HV20 it is a bad idea."
4,A different kind of Juan Gabriel,"It took several ""listens"" for me to appreciate this CD. It doesn't match up to the Juan Gabriel of the live performances at the Palacio de Bellas Artes; the energy just isn't there. The backup vocals are fantastic, and the arrangements are catchy. And Gabriel tells some delightfully mushy secrets in ""Estos son recuerdos."" No, this isn't the Gabriel of ""Celebrando 25 Años . . ."" It is nonetheless a Gabriel that once again pulls the listener into his world."
5,Juan Gabriel's FINEST,"What else can I say? I've said it already This is Juan's finest workever. I own it made a copy of it and have it in every room with aCDplayer, this cd is a must get. Plus, with... great prices, you getthe best of everything. Why are you still reading this, order it!"
5,"Love, Love, Love It!!","My 5 1/2 m/o is just learning to sit up and has outgrown his infant carrier. Before i got this, i would lug out the Baby Bjorn and carry him through the store kicking and screaming. I use this item everywhere now, almost on a daily basis. He loves to put the toys in his mouth (he's teething) and i love that it keeps him germ free. I would reccomend this item to friends or family in a heart beat, and actually just bought this as part of a shower gift for my cousin. It's a must have for moms & babies!"
2,bad coverage & not easily washed,"I loved the idea of this but I am now disappointed in the actual product. As the other reviewers have said, it does't cover the whole cart area. Specifically the sides, where my 7 month old ends up wanting to put her hands. I'm also disappointed that it is not machine washable. I am less likely to wipe it down with a damp cloth than I would be to just throw it in the wash."
5,I LOVE THE SHOP&PLAY,My 7 month old daughter and I are very pleased with our Shop &amp;amp; Play. I registered for it when I was pregnant and was really excited to receive it at my baby shower. My daughter loves the dangling toys and I feel better knowing that she is being protected against all of the disgusting germs on a shopping cart! I recommend this product to all of my friends with young children and recently purchased it as a Baby Shower gift for my sister.
1,DON'T BUY ANYTHING INFANTINO,"This is one of the most worthless purchases we have made. It does not cover the entire shopping cart where baby sits, and the toys are not within baby's reach. What a waste of money! Buy a Buggy Bagg or a Floppy Seat, or better yet, make your own! This shopping cart cover is useless.DON'T BUY IT!"
4,It's better live,"My first experience with Alturas was at a Swap Meet in the 1990s and they were performing live from their ""new"" Christmas CD at the time... I was more impressed with the live aspects of the band than I was after I bought the CD afterwards... The CD didn't quite bring out that live factor and that's the ONLY reason I knocked a full star off...I'd say comparing them to Mannheim Steamroller wouldn't be too far of a reach (judging on the baroque styles and diverse instruments played on their earlier Christmas albums)... It's not quite to MS standards...but still quite refreshing to the ear..."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I wanted to have an instramental christmas album so I tried this one.I wasted my money. I should of bought Kenny G or Zamphir.Hearing this album made me appreciate other albums.
1,UGH!,"This product looks very appealing, however, what I got was a white faced plastic box with rotating colored lights on the inside. The colors are nothing like those shown here.I don't plan to send it back.... its too much work for me, but I would not recommend this product to anyone.... very poor quality, I would go so far as to say this is deceptive advertizing."
4,please listen,ok well i honestly can say i started usin this product 2 months ago and after 2half weeks i was getting results for me the results never went away yet id recommend this
5,Exquisite--A Must Read,"I could not put this book down. I agree with the other reviewers on this page. This book is absolutely beautiful. Hickman's relationships with his husband, with his sisters, his parents, his birth family--all of them are exquisitely written. You can feel the pain the joy the sadness the triumph the love. Even though it is ostensibly a book about family and adoption and reunion, this book provides the best argument for gay marriage that I've ever read.Everyone must read this book. I recommend it to people of all religious backgrounds, especially those are the far right who insist upon denying equal rights in marriage to all people."
2,Product review and customer service,"Product was not of great quality and too small to be serviceable as a Basketball Shot Clock. Item was returned, however getting a refund from Dazadi is a hassle. They want a $100 restock fee on a $450 item. And they have not returned my call as they said they would. I will share the problem with my attorney."
4,"good stories, easy to read","I was quite impressed by this collection of tales by Chen, and even more so by the fact that they could be read almost effortlessly, unburdened by superfluous stylistic hoo-hah. It seems that much of the material relates to the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution rather than to said revolution per se. One gleans a strong picture of the frustratingly mixed messages that the Chinese masses perpetually receive from their government; the untold difficulty of living up to Mao's expectations (whatever they might have been in his heart of hearts); the disgust that good people feel in the level of spying and prying that seems expected of them; and, perhaps most chillingly, of the ubiety of the Communist party apparatus that ensures that every grouping of individuals--whether by tens, hundreds, whole factories, communes, or large cities--is firmly under the heel of the putatively socialist autocracy. All in all, the work was informative and fascinating."
3,"Fun, but not all it's cracked up to be","The book's promo implies that it is a collection of blunders by famous people. This is partly true. There are some interesting malapropisms and other goofs from famed people, but there are also a lot of obscure, random entries from nameless or otherwise unknown people. For example, some quotes are credited to, ""An Irish Politician"" or other nameless people.In summary, some aspects are entertaining and the book is unique. For quote fanatics, it is worthwhile addition to your collection if you have the money to spare."
1,top 2 on 776 stupidest ways too waste time and money,"dumb. Not funny. Not interesting. weirdly put together. Don't waste your time like I did. Tried reading at least 3 times, so not worth it!"
3,Instrumental Versions of the Hits of Bryan Adams,"Not quite what I expected. The CD cover stated ""beautiful instrumental renditions"" performed by the Starsound Orchestra.That might lead you to think ""easy listening."" Not so. More like soft rock- with heavy guitars, lots of percussion, and at times, a harsh sound. Hardly the sound of an ""orchestra."" I'd say the sound of the house rock band.Still, good instrumentals, nonetheless. Selling at a budget price on the Laserlight label, I'm not sorry that I bought it.But, if you loooking for an orchestral sound, you will likely be disappointed."
1,Simply mindblowing,never before has such talent been so beautifully captured. The only problem with this cd is that every time I listen to it I cant help but to touch myself.
4,"Fine, but not great","It's always difficult to make a greatest hits package- you can'tbe sure that everyone will like it. Still, this is a poorly compiled records with too many flaws flaws.This record includes 13 tracks, but none of them is culledfrom the excellent cooperation with Robert Cray and Johnny Copeland - Showdown. Moon is full should be here. Second- one of hissignature tunes Honey Hush isn't present as well. Albert himself liked it that much that he did a second version on Collins mix.The same goes for If you love me like you say.If you just want a sampler of Albert's Aligator label years, getDeluxe edition. It has its flaws too, but it's way better than this one."
2,Not as fun as a havoc heli,I bought a havoc heli and had a lot of fun so I bought I reflex for its advertised better control. I found the helicopter hard to manuever and it stopped working after about 60 minutes of flight. the havoc was much more fun for half the price.
2,Lots of fun but the battery life stinks,"It takes some getting used to this thing, and it takes longer because of the battery life. It takes about 2 hours to charge, and you get to fly for 20 minutes or so, (shorter times if you are just learning, and crash alot).My first indoor, small rc helicopter was the Bladerunner, and it flew fantastic right out of the box, and charging time was only about 15 to 20 minutes, with just as long of flight time. Now that is a helicopter that is so stable, you can literally set the throttle to hover, lay the control on the table, or floor, and the heli will stay right where it is at. I am seriously thinking about taking this thing back, and buying the new Bladerunner 2."
2,The fun doesn't last,"Even though the rotor blades fold up on impact, they tend to shatter anyway. The product only comes with a few spares, and replacements aren't available, unlike other small toy helicopters such as the Havoc.Battery life isn't very good, with long charge times vs. short flight times.Control is largely unresponsive. Turning is OK, but forward/reverse doesn't work well. There is a very noticable delay between control input and reaction from the helicopter."
1,Not Worth It,"For $60, you'd expect more. It's too small to create controlled lift, and there is no protection of the rotors which will inevitably lead to breaking the counterbalances.If you just want to play around with a toy helicopter, find one somewhere else for $20 and go wild."
1,reflex helicopter,I have tried unsuccesfully for a month to learn to fly this helicopter. I read the owner's manual carefully and trimmed it according to directions. It still wants to go fast forward. No amount of control input can stabilize or slow it down before it crashes into an obstruction. Now the motor is noisy and it won't even lift off. Basically this has been an uncontrollable unit. All my flying was done indooors on a soft carpet. Very disappointed and frustrated at lack of control. Too expensive to get so little satisfaction.
2,needs more conrtol,we originally bought 2 of the smaller helicopters and wanted one that turned better. this model was suppose to be able to turn.. it has 2 fans to turn with but there is such a delay that they dont work.
2,"Not controllable, not very resistant","The device flies and its very fun, but directional motors are weak and can't control the helicopter. Once is flying, it basically goes werever it wants (not were you want).Mine survived around 40 crashes, then got broken from the pole between the two main rotors. No spares. No way to fix it."
4,Balance is key,"Getting this copter balanced is the key to controlled flight. It is designed to fly forward when blades are in sync (trimmed), but that doesn't BALANCE the weight that allows you to hover and use the directional fan blades to guide it. I added 2"" of scotch tape on the tail shaft until it no longer flew forward. (not on the tail fin itself since the antenna is supposed to be in there) Once balanced, it's fairly easy to control, however if you crash, don't be surprised if you have to trim/sync the blades again. If it rotates right, trim left, rotates left trim right. It will still occasionally ignore that it's balanced, just land it and throttle up again and it's typically ok again. Flight time is short, but what fun while it lasts. One last note, this copter is far to light to fly outside unless (as another user indicated) there is ZERO wind."
4,Reflex Helicopter,My husband loves this helicopter although we are still trying to get the hang of it. The remote control is very sensitive thus we have had some rough landings but in all I think it is a great product. Lots of fun...and our cats are fascinated with it as well!!!!
3,"Don't bother, get the cheaper one","I bought his one a few days after getting the Havoc (the cheaper one). I thought with more directional control, I would enjoy it more...WRONG! It is less controllable than the Havoc and not nearly as much fun."
5,CANON INK,"These mfg ink cartridges are the finest, best ink and no leakage. I do a lot of photo's and I wold accept no less. And with the free shipping, well, it's a no brainer."
4,Good Bargain,Canon ink at a low price. I only wish they included the Black BCI 6 then I would give it 5 stars. But in all a good deal.
4,"Cheaper than Individual Cartridges, Plus Free Paper","The ink works perfectly in my Canon Pixma ip4000 printer. The package contains BCI-6Y (yello), BCI-6M (magenta), BCI-6C (cyan) and BCI-3eBK (black). The ip4000 also requires BCI-6BK, which you have to order separately. The 4x6 glossy photo paper is a nice bonus. It's fairly lightweight paper, but works fine."
1,Disappointed,"I received product that had been open and re taped with scott taped. I thought I was ordering ""new"" product but received something less than that. The product box had been riped open for whatever reason,( an order that someone else had sent back). The Amazon shipping packaging was fine it was the product box inside that had been open and resent. Clearly this should be considered ""used"""
4,as expected BUT...,"as advertised, but please read closely. the large 3eBK cart. is not included in this package. I ordered without noticing and was rather surprised at this oversight."
2,Ink for Canon w/ Photo Paper,Haven't used the ink yet so i don't know how good it is but thedealer never sent the Photo Paper with it ! Still waiting; HELLO ?!?!?!?!
5,good value,The same package of ink and photo paper I have been ordering for years. But - less expensive than Staples and Office Depot where I used to buy it.
1,"A truly awful example of editing, indexing, and page layout.","This book may contain some good information (not a lot), but you'll never find anything by looking in the index, which is a truly good example of a really BAD index. The book is also a good example of bad page layout. The publisher, if not the author, should have known better"
5,Informative!,Purchased as a text book for a College religion class. A text book I actually enjoy reading.
5,better than buds,"We like these, because they stay in your ears and they sound great.They usually last a year or so. I buy 2 at a time."
2,Sound is ok if they fit in your ear,I bought them based on the reviews. The problem is that they constantly fall out of one ear. Also there is some minor irritation on one of the ear buds.
3,They provide as promised.,"I bought these for my wife for working out. They replaced a similar pair of yellow sports headphones. They are what they are, $20 over the head headphones that sound OK, nothing more, nothing less. If they break, no big deal."
2,Insane asking price!!!!,"Whatever happened? This used to be a decent and inexpensive headset for an ordinary music playing device. Over the past years, I have gotten this headset (like 8) from Amazon.com and Best Buy for below US$18.00. And now the asking price is $77.88. Whoever jacked up this price need to have their head examined.....just plain greedy thinking you could fleece us on our desperation. I know Sony have discontinued and replaced this with a more pricier(not necessarily better) headset in the name of technological advancement. Take note that this Sony MDR W24V headset is not made to last. Constant using will wear (like only one functioning earbud) this equipment out in 6-8 months.If you take a look at the range of headset available in the market today, they are all a joke and wearing them makes us look like clowns (exclude Apple devices)."
3,good headphones,"I have used these headphones for several years the sound is good not great. I would order 3-4 at a time because they were $8.xx and I have one for the computer, one for the TV, and one for my Sony Walkman radio. And a spare because the wires eventually break inside,usually near the plug.But at nearly $50 I will step back to the Sony MDR-W08L which does not have the volume control but is <$8, and I used them before the mdr-w24v."
4,Great while shaving,"I get up early so I listen to my Ipod while shaving, etc. in the morning so as not to wake up everyone with a radio. This is the best design I've found for not getting in the way while shaving. I agree with the reviewers who complained about the durability, but at this price I don't mind needing to replace it a time or two a year. The sound is also much better than other headphones I have had in this price range."
2,The Mid range is too low!,"I remember buying this model before but don't remember the sound being this stuffy. Everything sounds too hissy and dense. If I could draw a frequency curve for these phones, it would definately look like flat ground with a steep hill rising up the right side."
4,great sound,"The sound on these is great. I love the volume control on them as well. I guess the only draw back is that they don't fold up for easy carrying, but I don't like the other kind with ear buds. These are great for me."
2,Not For The Gym,"I bought these to replace the old orange/white sport model by Sony.They don't fit my ipod jack firmly, so I am unable to use them while running.The length of the cord is short.They don't have any real bass sound.Better off using them to plug into a laptop or other home use."
2,Decent but not as good as the MDR-W20G,"I had hoped to get a replacement for my old MDR-W20G headphones, which now seem to be discontinued. Unfortunately, these headphones have a 13.5mm head, which I didn't notice when I purchased them. The MDR-W20G headphones have a 16mm diameter which gives way better bass response. So personally I wouldn't recommend these, since the bass is far inferior, although I do like the fact they're far more lighweight."
3,Sennheisers sound better,"I love over head light weight headphones like these because they don't fall off like earbuds yet allow you to hear the outside world enough to be aware of what's going on. Alternatively, they can be pressed into your ear a bit to block more sound (but won't achieve isolation like in-ear buds).This sony model fits nicely, is lightweight, and has a very useful volume control on the cord.However, the quality is low and my earpad occasionally pops out; and these are not abused as I use them at my desk at work.My big complaint is the sound. For the price, it's not bad. However when compared to Sennheiser PX-10's of similar design (and at the time I paid only $5 more for them) the Sennheiser's blew the sony's out of the water with more musical sound, broader range, and less fatiguing highs.For this reason, I recommend anyone looking at sony headphones to take a serious look at Sennheisers. I've used other models of both, and every time the Sennheisers sound better."
3,"Good, but they short out...","I'm on my second pair of these and have decided to switch to a different headphone. I use them for the gym with my Creative Zen Stone. The first pair I had, one side shorted out after about a year. The pair I am on now shorted out just after 8 months. I love the headphone but wish they would sort out the issue as it seems to be pretty common."
3,"Good quality, but Cord too short","These headphones are comfortable and have a very good sound quality for the money, but the cord is just too short. If they had made it 6 inches longer, it would have been fine. But as is, it doesn't reach to my MP3 player in my pocket. Note that I am fairly tall (6'2""), so shorter people may not have this problem."
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought these as they appeared to be good for exercising and I've had good experiences with sony products in the past. First off you have to keep the volume control on the cord low and use your players volume control - at higher volumes on the integrated control the sound gets distorted especially at the high end. OK, I can live with that. The real letdown was the fact that these ""in-the-ear"" headphones didn't stay in the ear so well. Every 1/5 mile on the treadmill I found myself pushing them back in as they quickly worked their way out till they were resting over my ears. I'll use them for the time being but will stay on the lookout for a better pair."
3,Rough around the edges,"I have been using theSony MDR-A34L Vertical In-the-Ear Headphones with 3-Hinged Headbandbut have been repeatedly disappointed in the plastic breaking. I tried these and so far, I like the fit and the small, in-ear buds. So, why 3 stars... the ear buds have a seam along the center and the plastic is rough and sharp. It pokes my ear and while running, creates a blister. Not so good, but sanding the edge down has helped."
2,"Nice concept, thin sound","Yes, they are lightweight and I like the way they fit and work without being a plug in your ear like regular buds.The only downside is the sound. They deliver virtually no bass at all but are loaded to mid-range and treble. Unless you are half deaf, you may find the upper end on the painful side since it delivers really high frequencies to the detriment of the rest of the sound spectrum. Sony should not have put their name on these."
2,sony headphones,The headphones were really comfortable but they broke in like a week...the wires are to thin and break easily.
4,Acceptable,"I bought these because ear buds won't stay in my ears. They are super light and flexible, so that they don't crack if they get bent a bit. I also found them tolerable to sleep in, although less comfortable for that than padded headphones. The only complaint is the volume control, which is so tiny it's hard to use and impossible to set accurately. I have given up on using it, and next time will replace these with the version without the volume control."
1,Faulty plug-in on both pairs; don't buy it,"I bought a pair of the inexpensive ones (without volume control). I had a problem with the plug in on my iPod--for some reason, if the plug twisted, I lost the sound (either all the sound or part).Very annoying, but I liked the style of the phones. So I bought another pair assuming the problem must be a loose wire or faulty plug-in. Nope. Same problem. If the plug twists at all in my pocket, I lose some sound. Not a good fit.This problem is built in to these cheap phones,and now I have two pairs that don't work. I have since bought two other (non-Sony) pairs of phones with straight plugs, and they work fine, so the problem is not the iPod--it's these phones.I would stay away from these phones."
3,Pretty Good for Merle,"This is not my favorite output from Merle. The voice is great; the selection is okay. I am glad to have it in my collection, but listen to others more."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,I must have read through the product description too quickly. I anticipated getting a song of all Jenny Phillips performed music. This instead was an anthology of various artists all of whom I like so I was not too disappointed. I just didn't get what I was expecting.
2,not so great,I purchased this watch from Amazon and at first it was fine. The I noticed a piece from the back of the face turned up missing. Amazon would not take it back as it was over 30 days since my order. Warranty still in effect but contact with authorized repair place requested money up front. Seems to eat batteries. Very unhappy. Not worth the money.
4,"Great, deep, horrific book.","This is deep, dense, poetic, surreal, mystical and sometimes disgusting stuff. I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt like it could of been trimmed.. I think the author lost her way in a few parts. Anyway, I am dying to read more by her. This book is original and beats the heck out of most of the horror out there."
2,Erratic,"It's hard to describe. There'd be a big spate of stuff going on, things were interesting...then 2 or 3 chapters it would be drag...drag...drag... then a few sentence or a paragraph of cool then drag...drag...drag...the pacing was off."
4,Rhode Island's Salty History,"This book is for anyone interested in the sea and the maritime history of Rhode Island, New England or the United States for that matter. It is a must-have for serious scholars of the age of sail and for armchair sailors alike as it examines the exciting and sometimes scandalous past. As Donald D. Breed wrote in the Providence Journal 2/13), ""Do not look for this book on the coffee tables of many of Rhode Island's first families. On the one hand it is a scholarly almost dry history of a great many extended voyages by Rhode Island mariners. But it is also an expose of the nefarious activities of those seagoing men: piracy, the slave trade, running opium. To read it is to gain a new appreciation of why the colony was known as 'Rogue's Island.'... This is a hard book to put down, the subject matter is so gripping."""
5,"Very advanced, but oh so rewarding!","Frankly, I don't see how any person serious about writing can be without this book! It is just so good. Walter Nash is a well-known scholar with many books to his credit on all aspects of writing. This one is probably the most useful one for writers who want to develop their style. Nash gives many examples of writing techniques which will help the struggling writers to express themselves in words, and, indeed, in grammar and sentence structure. Nash also can write, so it is worth reading this book for his writing alone."
1,Bad,"I was so excited to order a nice copper pot from this company, but it arrived and the interior was not completely smooth, so that makes jam stick to the areas that are not smooth. I had seen a video on jam making where the person said this was the pot to get, so I bought one. Now returning due to poor quality control."
2,Dissapointed,"We gave my 5 year old this toy as a christmas gift and within the first 10 minutes it broke. The red back ""muffler"" broke. It also stopped running even after we changed batteries several times. At the moment, it runs sometimes but other items no matter what you do it wont move. I am very disappointed since this toy cost over $50.00 and it was not worth it. My 5 year old loves mario and he had received as gifts several of the smaller versions of this toy and Luigi etc and they all work great. He kept asking for the big one to be able to run it outside. He has not been able to get it outside not even once. He is a pretty good driver, and it wasn't anything he did that caused it to break. We were all watching the toy and helped him take it out of the box and put batteries in etc etc. I have tried to contact the company but have not been able to locate them. BOOO"
4,A great Christmas Gift,"I got this toy for my 3 year old for Christmas. It arrived on time and my little guy loves it. It is sort of noisy and I think he will have even more fun playing with it outside once the snow melts! Overall, I'm quite happy with it."
5,still waiting for Best Of....,"With the very disappointing new announcement that the Very Best of John Klemmer release has been delayed until 2025!!! one wonders whether fans of Mr. Klemmer will have to remain satisfied with his past recordings....The anticipation that Mr. Klemmer will surprise his fans with something new and/or a public performance would be most welcome. I, for one, do not expect to be alive in 2025 and the delay of his newest release comes as a great disappointment. Those who are new to Mr. Klemmer's music can enjoy the breadth of his creativity, romance and artistry in his past recordings such as FINESSE. John Klemmer has the unique ability to express the unspoken through his music,and lift the spirit to a higher place, as if to say, ""come join me in this dance called life....""Mr. Klemmer - please come out and play.... the world needs you :)"
2,Defective,I bought this printer as a replacement for an identical one that finally wore out. It arrived missing the network card which then took another couple weeks to receive. That card was defective also and I am still awaiting re3solution to this problem.
3,Fast Printer,"We have had a 4200 since September 2003 when it was purchased to print daily business reports and monthly billing statements. We have been pleased with its speedy printing and with its excellent print quality.On the down side, we have a LOT of trouble with paper jams. Seems like every day or so we have to open it up and pull out a sheet of crumpled paper. And it is pretty bad about feeding more than one sheet at a time. I wouldn't swear that a more expensive paper would not solve the problem but we use so much paper we have been buying the least expensive, store branded variety.One further observation; the construction quality just seems a little cheesy, not like our old HP LaserJet 4, which has printed about a zillion copies and just keeps plugging along, never jams and never feeds multiple sheets. (All the criticisms mentioned also apply to an HP OfficeJet 7130 all-in-one we purchased for another office)"
3,Not the book pictured,"book is in good condition, but is not the book pictured.Very disappointed that it is not what I ordered."
5,a must for every high school and college,"Dr. Ward's book is the best in its class since Langston Hughes' and Arna Bontemps' THE POETRY OF THE NEGRO. The volume is a must for every high school and college in the country. This book is so beautifully organized that it becomes more than a cronology of African American poetry, but a history of Blacks in the United States through poetry. Dr. Ward has left no one out who deserves to be heard, and has wisely included several brilliant, often neglected, Southern poets. If the publishers of this book realize what a goldmind it is, they would see to it that it is placed in every school and library in the country."
4,SWEET AS HONEY,"WHAT A REMARKABLE WAY TO BEGIN A BOOK. MIKE BLAKELY HAS A UNBELIEVEABLE SENSE OF THE HISTORY OF THE COMANCHE PEOPLE. I REALLY ENJOY THE DETAIL HE PUTS INTO HIS DESCRIPTIONS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY PASSIONATE MAN THAT PUTS EVERYTHING HE HAS INTO HIS WORK. I ADMIRE THE ENERGY PUT INTO THIS WORK. I CAN PICTURE MYSELF IN AMONGST THESE PEOPLE, RIDING WITH THEM, AND WATCHING THIS ""BIG DOG"" RUN THROUGH CAMP. HIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS PHENOMENAL. WELL DONE. THIS BOOK IS REALLY SWEET AS HONEY."
5,WONDERFUL READ ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE COMANCHE NATION,"The horse has come to the Shoshoni nation that walked or used dogs to carry their belongings as they searched for game to keep from starving. Once the horse arrived, they ate the first one, told you that they were hungry, but they learned a new way = the way of the horse, and they learned to ride as no one as ever rode. From Wyoming to Mexico was their territory and no people were more ruthless."
4,Review of Thomas Valone's work in homopolar R&D,"Tom has done a good job in providing a text that is a recording of historical events and his own experiences homopolar research and development with a very detailed appendix. Although the homopolar motor is a bit of an anomoly in traditional electromagnetics, Tom provides a reasonable explanation for the experimental results and other developments. The discussion of relativistic effects of rotating systems is quite insiteful and would indicate that classical Electromagnetic theory needs an update!"
1,Save Your Money,"This book consists mainly of reprints of previously written articles. The quality of the contributions varies greatly. At the high end are the English translations of the articles on relativity theory by Einstein and Laub. At the low end are the descriptions of visits by extraterrestrials whose spaceships use homopolar-like power generators. Some of the articles are incomplete, that is, they do not contain all of the pages from the article. So if you want to read the whole article, you will have to get it elsewhere.If you are seriously interested in homopolar generators, you need to look elsewhere. Be careful because the hompolar generator attracts more pseudoscience ""kooks"" than you can imagine!"
5,"Yes, I think I will.",If you love king of queens then buy this. If you do not then I would suggest you go knit or something. All I will say is it totals just under 500 minutes all together. There is nothing else to say.
4,"Great show, gets better with time.","This season was better than the first season, and the first season was excellent. So as season two is now out on DVD, I rushed to the store and picked it up, and spent and entire weekend watching the Heffernan's, and Arthur. I think my favorite episode has to be eitehr the one where Doug gets stuck in the attic with Ray Romano, or the classic episode where Doug throws the really bad Bachelor party for his cousin. There are a few filler episodes that I felt could have been done a lot better. Especially the where Doug met Carrie episode, and the episode where Doug and the football team reunite. But those episodes are still good for a few laughs. Pick it up, its well worth it."
5,Best Show on TV that never got any attention,"The King of Queens was the best show on TV and it didn't get the respect it deserved. It was on the air for nine seasons, that says something about it. Wasn't Seinfeld on for nine seasons? It was wholesome and family oriented and I could watch it with my sons and husband and not be embarrassed. So much of their personalities were the same as my husband and I, I started calling him 'Doug'. I miss the whole family and wish it were back on the air. I only have season eight to buy and then my collection will be complete."
5,Awesome!,This is for any level because she suggests you go at your own pace. You'll be sore a day or two after. I just bought this tape and love it already.
2,After reading some of the other reviews...,"I will have to go home, pull this tape out and try it again and see if I cannot stick with it. For me it was just too boring, long and at times I wanted to slap Callan Pickney for being so... Well... I guess the best adjective is haughty. Some of the things she says and her mannerisms in general drive me nuts! But, I suppose if I turn the volume down and play some good tunes, it would be more bearable. The exercise in content is good, if you can handle an hour of isometric, slow, very controlled movements taught by a woman who appears emaciated and anorexic (frustration to the pudgy)... Like I said, maybe I should give it another whirl, the exercises that is, cause they do work from what I remember. But this is definately a toner tape, not a fat burner. I cannot imagine using this tape more than once or twice per week. ERGO-Looking to lose weight-look somewhere else!!!"
2,Ballet Equipment Needed,"I read all the information available on this video, but not until I had purchased it and played it did I realize you need a ballet studio in your home. A ballet bar is needed, and an adjustable one at that. I believe the moves (if done correctly, which could be a problem too) would benefit the person exercising, but you won't have Ms. Pinckney in your home to correct your mistakes like she does almost all of the people in the video with her."
1,Not good,"Lots of complicated stretching in awkward positions, neck strain and instructions that don't seem to make much sense other than to the instructor. Have not yet found a video better than the terribly cheesy but effective ""Buns of Steel"" (the original, with Greg Smithey)."
5,Not for aerobic stamina. If you want toned this is it.,"For toning there is none better than Callanetics, particularly if there is a problem with the beer belly. You'll never need to do another sit up again. Be warned the stomach exercise will require persistance. It is very, very difficult for those who have allowed adbominal slippage. However if you are tired of wearing your chest around your stomach it is very much worth the effort."
5,Miracle tape for toning and stretching!,"I tried Callanetics back in college with a friend who had the tape from the 80's. It didn't take long to fit into the jeans I used to wear. I've looked for the tape since then, and when I came across it with Amazon, I was so excited. This is a great tape for toning, but it also really helps my bad back and neck to stretch. I have slept better and woken up without all the knots in my back since I started the tape. I definitely recommend it!"
4,Take your time and keep doing it!,"I did callanetics at a gym about 6 years ago, and I remember dropping 1 dress size after only one month. Then life got in the way and I stopped doing it. When I saw this tape on Amazon, I had to buy it. I've been doing the tape for the past 2 weeks, and I have to tell you, I can feel my body getting firmer and more flexible. The exercises are hard, so don't let Callan's soft tone and slow pace fool you. Take your time and don't be discouraged. Some reviews complained about how boring the music and Callan are. I turn the radio on in the background while I do the tape to alleviate that problem. Slow and steady wins the race. Take your time, keep the right form, and you'll be fine."
3,"Good, bad and ugly","Good: it is non-impact so if you are like me who don't like to jump around to get into shape, you will like this tape. Some of the exercises are very effective and challenging. Also good for people who are coming out of illness since there is no impact on joints.Bad: Neck, neck, neck! When I do ab workout, I don't know how to round my head towards chest without straining my neck...can somebody tell me? This is quite a pain.Ugly: BORING.....doing those subtle, small (1/2-1/4 inch) moves for 100 times is not easy as you might think. After doing Callanetics religious for a whole month, I got so bored of this tape. And there is no cardio workout in this routine.So? use this as a supplement to your regular cardio workout. Pulling your muscles internally is different than losing those extra fat. This will not move your bathroom scale, but measuring tapes."
5,"After an hour of Callanetics, you just feel good!",I've never felt so strong and relaxed after a workout. Wonderful! END
5,A workout that actually works!,"I have purchased just about every workout video known to man (Cindy Crawford, Denise Austin, Grier Childers, etc.) and have never seen results even after weeks of faithfully working out. Today is the third day I have used the Callanetics video and I already feel a difference. The workouts are targeted stretching exercises that focus on specific areas. The great thing about this tape is that the pace is steady and that Callan (the instructor) has a very relaxed and calm manner. I would say that the only downsides are that a) you will probably not see immediate results (she claims that it takes about 19 hours) and b) you will probably be a little sore after the first few workouts. I don't see a visable difference in my weight yet, but I do feel ""taller"" more relaxed after only 3 workouts. I highly reccommend this video for everyone."
4,A repurchase of an old favorite,I was glad to find this book at a reasonable price. I wanted to review and use some of the exercise I used years ago that were very effective. It is a calm approach to very small but specific movements that produce quick and dramatic results. An oldie but still very good to add to an exercise routine. I like the quiet and calm approach for a change.
1,Very bad exercises from an uneducated woman,"This video strained:-My neck with the ab work-My back with the leg work-My knees with the pelvic workI didnt get any kind of workout and was bored and in pain(above strains)throughout the whole video. It is obvious she doesnt have any ""degrees"" in fitness because if she were at all knowledgable in this field, she wouldn't have you bouncing in your stretches as well as putting your body and joints at risk."
3,Boring by myself. More suited to guided controlled group.,"I did this for 2 wks. the first time. Just could not get flexible or results enough to continue. Physiologically, my joints & ligaments don't move that way. I could use bodywork to loosen the kinks, so I could improve. Every 2 years or so I'd try it again. After 4-5 days, give me vigorous, useful workouts like kickboxing, Tae Bo, and dance tapes. I was brought up Southern, courteous and meek. I love feeling as if I could defend myself or show off on a dance floor. I think for myself now. I rent first, then buy the keepers."
5,Happy,"LOVE this video - Callan Pinkney was way ahead of the pack. 10 years / 10 hours / 20 years ago!So Happy to find this again. Used it years ago - in a word: RESULTS!In a sentence - using this video years ago gave me a sense of being in my body comfortably profoundly - for what I remember as the first time.More: This was made before the word ""core"" was used much (as far as I know) - the experience of finding my core through this workout was very freeing.All my parts were communicating and working as a unit. My pelvis knew where it belonged - creating comfort and eliminating a subtle sense of searching for comfort & balance.Happy to get back to a great workout. I will start slowly! as I did years ago, doing only a few of each for the first few days - not pushing through discomfort - I found my body craved more & worked up quickly to the recommended reps.I also had the morning/evening Callanetics video - however I like this one much more!Now to find a bar!"
4,Great gun but where does one buy extra magazines.,I would like another magazine for this gun. This gun is great. It is much better than green gas guns for the money. A perfect sidearm. I would like to see magazines for this gun for sale.
4,Great gun on a budget!,"This is a great gun for the price. I've had mine for several months now. Part of the rear sight broke off the week I got it, and it's started leaking recently. But for $40, there's nothing on the market as impressive as this gun. I chronoed it around 450 fps or something in that range. I would recommend extra magazines and a speed loader with it."
1,great for about 1 month,i got this gun about a month or so ago after our game 2 days ago i took it out with a new CO2 to see how much longer till i clean it and then i realized the safety was stuck so i took it all apart and is still broken to this day u may think i dropped it or something but my friends say i protect it to much i wouldn't even let them touch they can have it now because it sucks!
2,meh. mine must've been old?,bought 3 of these to replace 2 that came with the camera.. of the 3 only one will hold a charge more than 5 minutes. Vary dissapointed.
2,not impressed,"Not very Impressed. I'm an art teacher and bought the DVD hoping it would provide my students with insight into the Harlem Renaissance (for many of my students this is part of their heritage). Although much of the content is factual and informative, I was bothered by how the video depicts LITERALLY every white person who was supportive of blacks during the Harlem Renaissance as conniving. I believe that there were some white people who were genuinely interested in seeing blacks succeed without having ulterior motives on their agenda. I wish I could find a video that highlights the extraordinary talent of black people during the Harlem Renaissance and their triumph under such harsh conditions (due to whites thinking they were superior) without bashing ALL white people. There are bad and good people of every ethnicity. Also, the video is quite dated."
5,Good,"Well this is a Mozart CD. I have listening in other versions but I think this is the best, and of course Mozart is always Mozart. Rekommenderas."
2,A FAILED EXPERIMENT,"On these recordings we have a ""copy"" of a primitive fortepiano recorded at a considerable distance. It sounds like someone backstage is plucking rubber bands.Can this be how Mozart expected to make his name and fame, playing a toy piano way off in the background somewhere? ""Authentic"", my ---.Later fortepianos (e.g. the Grafs from the 1820's) developed some tone and volume, but even these cannot hold their own against a full orchestra.If you are looking for a recording of the complete concerti, the recordings Geza Anda made with the Salzburg Mozarteum are still available and are very fine indeed."
2,Running out of Gas,"With ""Think Visual,"" the Kinks 1980s ""comeback"" started to peter out. The album is largely a retread of the two previous (and far superior) albums ""State of Confusion"" and ""Word of Mouth."" As a songwriter, Ray Davies seems no longer particularly interested in writing memorable songs. The result is the singles ""Working at the Factory,"" and ""Rock'n'Roll Cities"" sound like retreads and the filler material is mostly bland. The one exception is ""Video Shop,"" a humorous track that sounds like it came from another era. This is a case of a great band just hanging on too long."
1,One spin = one star,"The only Kinks album I played once, then never again. Even the other weak albums from the '70s and '80s merited a second or third listen. Absolutely nothing to recommend this one--and the loathesome ""Rock'n'Roll Cities"" makes it a candidate for destruction with a hammer."
3,"Not the best Kinks CD, but then again, it's not the worst","This isn't my favorite Kinks CD, but it does have a few standout tracks including the beautiful Lost and Found, Dave Davies' When You Were A Child, and the title track.Overall, it's not the best the Kinks have to offer, but then again, it's far from the worst."
4,A Minor But Worthwhile Addition to the Kinks' Canon,"This is not from the Kinks' best period: Having just switched labels from RCA to MCA, the Kinks sputtered with Think Visual, notching their first disappointment from their video-era third act. In retrospect, however, the songs have aged nicely: ""Lost and Found"" is a Ray Davies classic ballad, emotional and powerful, recalling Waterloo Sunset and other of his great three-minute dramas. ""Video Shop"" was at the time cutting edge, a look at the rise of video stores amid the squalor of big-city industrial decay. In hindsight, it comes off as another Ray Davies look at a now-dead but once-bright technological invention, an updated ""Steam-Powered Trains"" for the 80s. ""Think Visual"" finds Ray biting the hands that feed him (as usual), turning the rise of MTV into a scathing indictment of commercialism and superficiality in modern music. In sum, this one is worth a second look, a minor though worthwhile addition to the Konkers' catalogue."
4,I second the notion - ignore the critics,"I had to write to express my admiration for this album, which in my opinion is the band's most underrated. You'll like it if you especially like the Kinks of late 60s. This is not the heavy metal of Low Budget, State of Confusion, etc. I think the production could be better, but there's not a bad song here and Killing Time is very good - ""A man has one, a cat has nine."" It's definitely not for the newcomer to the Kinks, no, buy ""Something Else"" or ""Arthur"" or ""Village Green"" if that's the case. But if you're a real Kinks fan and you've heard that this album is a low point, you heard wrong."
3,true kinks fans will like ti,"don't pay attention to the critics. Ray Davies is probably the best songwriter in rock history. though a newcomer to the kinks may not find this album worth much, the die-hard kinks fans will see the beauty in it. ""Working at the factory"" is lyrically quite poignant. ""Killing Time"" is a great song, ""Video Shop"" as well. though the production may leave something to be desired, if you are willing to look beyond the exterior here, you will find some gems. Admittedly, the kinks aren't as great as they were in the past, but name one thirty five year old band that is!"
3,Great protection from drops; not so durable hinge,"I have long been a fan of Rhinoskin products. I had their aluminum case for the Palm Vx and was very pleased. I have had this case for my new E2 since May 05 and today when I opened it, the plastic hinge broke and my palm fell to the pavement. Apparently, the Palm itself is unharmed, so I am lucky in that respect.However, I would caution anyone who buys this about the flimsy plastic hinge. It is a shame, really, because my Vx case had a completely metal hinge. I believe that Rhinoskin has to resort to the plastic because of the VERY narrow slot design that Palm has used on the E2. (the Vx had a slot almost large enough to put a stylus in). Buy this case for it's shock resistance, but be aware of the crappy plastic hinge."
1,Does Not Fit E2 Beware,"This is a decent case for the Tungsten E, but make no mistake about it, it will not work for the E2 Model. The plastic latch is cheap and the closure could be more secure."
4,E2 free fall two stores and in to a puddle,"I didnt think twice when getting this with my dad's new E2.two weeks later he forgot the second palm ruleDont put a palm in the front shirt pocket.Consequently his palm fell two floors, and in to a puddle.this case actually saved the palm.Palm didnt suffer ANY damage, and was wiped from the water.the front side doesnt swirl all the way back.get one.Niv"
4,Tough!,This is a tough case. I like that fact.I had a hard time inserting memory cards in the holder and closing the case but I didn't buy it for carrying memory cards.
4,Laserjet 4300 New 2003 HP line,"The Good:Very fast very clear, 6-10 seconds to print 1st page. I got an avg. of 51 pages per min. (HP says 45 PPM)1200 x 1200 dpi with REt, UltraPrecise toner, HP ProRes 1200, HP FastRes 1200.Paper: 10 envelopes-optional envelope feeder for 75 envelopes, Letter, legal, executive, No. 10 envelopes, Monarch envelopes,(plain, letterhead, prepunched, bond, color, preprinted, recycled), transparencies, labels, card stock, user-defined up to 20lb media weight.Memory: 4300 64MB. 4300dtn,4300dtns, 4300dtnsl, 4300n, 4300tn 80MB. Max Memory 416MBGet the base model 4300 and add the print server card (JetDirect 615N). The price is better. Memory is not expensive now so you can add 128MB if you need more than 64MB, that will be less than buying the 4300 w/ the print server.The Bad:IEEE 1284-compliant parallel interface port, NO USB. NO Print to/from Bluetooth, infrared built in.One-year limited warranty; RETURN to HP ONLY You will pay to ship this 65lb Monster to HP for repair."
4,HP laserjet printer,We had to sent the first printer back as it had a problem and Todd sent us a new one that was awesome. We have no problems at this time.
3,Too theoretical,"This is not a bad book, however, there are better ones out there. The author assumes absolutely no previous programing experience and therefore even includes a HTML tutorial, which is unnecessary in my opinion. Why would you get into ASP if you don't even know basic HTML? Moreover, the examples provided are too far removed from reality. The author just piles on the different objects, requests etc. without giving evidence of them being actually useful in real life. This book is more of a reference than anything else. For actually starting ASP, I'd rather recommend ""Sams teach yourself ASP in 21 days"", supplemented by Wrox's ""Beginning ASP databases"" if you're into more serious development."
1,Bad Book!...,"Well, if you are looking for frustration this book will help you to experience plenty of it! The sample code is really bad. The examples are also incomplete. It seems that the goal of this book was thickness not accuracy. It's possible to read 10-12 pages just to learn almost nothing. Too much worthless filler....I was hoping that I would learn more than just how much anger I can feel towards a book...."
2,For Reference Only,"Although this book is thorough in covering all topics surrounding ASP, the examples and sample code are of little help. The sample code is TERRIBLY error prone and nearly every page requires some debugging. Once the applications are working, they are basic and offer little insight into intermediate web development."
1,Not for Beginners,"This text did teach me some things, but the author did not comment his code. He sometimes wrote sample code that spanned 3 or 4 pages and did not comment the code or explain what he wrote in detail. I am a beginner to ASP but not to VB and he over programs and uses too many intricate functions that no programmer could quickly understand WITHOUT COMMENTS."
1,Utterly useless book,"This book is poorly organized. The author starts out by saying that one does not have to be a programmer and then immediately launches into PERL, CGI, ADO, VB, etc. How many non-programmers know about ADO providers. On administering IIS, he states that one can use the web browser. But, you will get a message from Microsoft that this can only be done if one is running Windows SERVER 2000. A hundred pages or more are devoted to learning HTML and another 100 to VB Script. If I wanted to learn HTML, I would get a book on HTML. Happy to say that the bookstore refunded my purchase, but still angry that I wasted two hours reading it and then returning it."
2,Beginner unfriendly,"For the ASP neophyte, Mastering ASP 3 is a poor effort. While the book does cover many of the ASP basics, it does it in such a way that beginners have very little understanding of what and how the various lessons can actually be used in real web applications. The text is long, difficult to read, and there are several chapters where you complete a chapter feeling that you haven't learned anything of practical value.While, I'm sure that it is possible to learn ASP from this book, I'm equally sure that there are other books out there that will allow you to learn in a faster, easier, and with less confusion.I'd recommend the Beginning Active Server Pages 3.0 from Wrox for those who are interested in a better organized, more practical way to learn ASP."
2,Unorganized book !,I bought this book hoping to get to know ASP in a quick and structured way. But I was very disappointed after reading it several chapters. This book is not organized in a way that make sense for the beginners !! I have to look for other book for ASP.
2,Doesn't work as advertised in product manual,Works great with Windows XP but is not recognized by Mac OS X (10.3.5) on iBook G4. The manual says it will but it doesn't. The service department at zio comfirmed it doesn't - I don't know why they have that in their manual then. Best Buy has USB card readers that work at half the price.
4,Good Time Music,"This is a very good cd. If you have this cd (Best of Import) and the ""Best of"" (U.S.), then you have the ""Box Tops"". It takes both cd's to have the complete Box Tops. This import left off three hits that should have been on it, (""Sweet Cream Ladies, Foward March"", ""Turn On A Dream"" and ""I Met Her In Church""). The thing that makes this import cd so good is the album cuts that it contains. ""Fields Of Clover"" and ""Lost"" are great songs. ""Everything I Am"", ""Ain""t No Way"" (Neil Diamond song), ""I Pray For Rain"", and ""Weeping Analeah"" are really good songs. Then you get the Box Tops versions of ""Whiter Shade Of Pale"", ""I'm Movin' On"" and ""I'll Hold Out My Hand"". The Box Tops are a winning ticket, Alex Chilton singing, Dan Penn producing and writing and the Memphis Horns. The quality of these recordings are great. If you like music from a simpler time, back when music just made you sing a long, tap your toes and play air guitar, then this is it."
3,Too many barns,"There are good directions for painting grass, roofing shingles, wooden siding, tin roofs, large rocks, etc. But I had hoped for more variety in the projects. Even though different aspects of the barns are presented in each lesson, nevertheless of the 7 lessons presented, lessons 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are barns. And the mixing of colors is strange. For example, on page 26 a mix of one part Phthalo Blue and three parts Mars Black are used with ""considerable water"" to paint a very pale blue sky, almost off-white. The mixture is very dark. Then the sky is highlighted with yellow ochre light and cadmium yellow light. Again, dark...yet the illustration shows a barely yellow area."
2,Not as good as it looks.,"The Winsome Wood Shoe Rack looks good in the picture...not so good in person. The wood is thin, the tray is thin and a bit flimsy. If I had seen this rack in a store, I would not have paid the amount charged for this product."
1,AVOID AAA Home Furniture Discounts!,"AAA Home Furniture Discounts lacks integrity should be avoided at all costs. I have dealt with hundreds of Sellers in the Amazon Marketplace and AAA Home Furniture Discounts is by far the worst. They misrepresented the product and refused to replace damaged parts, then taunted me and said they would win against any claim I might file. They are completely unprofessional and never even sent an order acknowledgment or shipping confirmation. DO NOT REINFORCE THIS BEHAVIOR!"
4,I like it but not worth the 60 some dollars,"We've had this for a couple years and it does the job. The pan is nice for the dripping winter shoes. The umbrella rack is a nice touch and it fits perfect where we have it. However, we paid quite a bit less than the current 60 some dollar cost and I would not pay more than 40 for it personally."
4,Looks nice,I like this type of rack way better than cubbies. The grit will fall to the floor for easy cleanup.
3,This camera has no flash!,"I don't remember reading it on here but this camera has no flash! I bought it for my daughter because it had the view window on the back so she could see the pictures she just took. It's very small and perfect for a child. Except it takes very dark pictures. Other than that, the pictures are kind of grainy and fuzzy at times but I guess that's expected for a camera of this price."
4,brief summary,"If Dante Alighieri and James Joyce were to caroom through the seven circles of L.A. in a Greyhound bus, pursued by a bevy of graduate-student imps condemned to retranslate ""Notes from Underground"" into ever more modern English, the result might be this book."
2,don't buy,"This blender is beautiful and it does blend well, when you get it all assebled correctly, which is quite tricky. I have had to test it by filling it w/ water first to make sure it won't leak, before using. Parts are extremely difficult to get. Most of the parts can't be put in the dishwasher. My husband put it all in the dishwasher and the bottom will no longer fit on the base. It has become warped. Now, I am once again w/o a blender."
1,A WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY,assembly is a job in itself cheaper blenders are better designed my husband goes to use it starts the thing up and it starts smoking This thing is a waste!!!!!!!!!
2,Item does not look like item pictured.,"I item I received the bottom open compartment is very narrow- about an inch in height, rendering it useless. I ended up returning it back. Amazon, please post a more representative picture of the item."
3,Review of 1000 for 2000 Startling Predictions for the New Millennium from Prophets Ancient and Modern,This is an interesting book however it is difficult to place Nostrodamus' predictions in place and time and also just understanding what he is trying to say.
3,"Entertaining, but highly inaccurate","I felt the book was entertaining but that it was highly inaccurate and contradictory.For example, it stated very blatantly that Al Gore will be our next president. Al Gore wasn't our next president.This is just a small example of the many inaccuracies of the book.My only recommendation is to only read the book for entertainment value and to not spend alot of money on it."
2,Fiction,Hogue knows how to cater to the gullibility of people. As a work of fiction it creates some excitement.
5,Braver's Best yet!,"With Flashback, Gary Braver has topped his previous excellent medical thrillers, Elixir and Gray Matter. His prose just gets better with each book -- he takes nothing for granted in his intricate -- but completely plausible -- plotline and intense characters. A real winner -- read it!Reviewed by Caitlin Scott-Turner, auhor of The Queen's Fencer, published by Five Star, an imprint of Thomson-Gale."
4,A very good thriller,"This fast paced novel has enough twists and turns to keep you reading eagerly until the end. There is an interesting medical premise in this mystery-thriller which unfolds well. While I had to suspend belief at times, it was fun enough that I was happy to do so. While many of the characters are not especially believable, some are, and the good plot made this a worthwhile summer read for me."
5,My first Braver novel but certainly NOT my last!,This novel grabbed me within the first few pages. The story captivated me with it's page-turning suspense and true-to-life characters. Gary's writing style left me wanting more. It was a pleasure to meet him at our Book Club. This book was a hit. Can't wait for his next winner!
3,Blue Foundation - Blue Foundation,"Blue Foundation, with their self-titled debut on the esteemed April Records, mines the never-ending vein of jazzy trip-hop, and come up with a payload that's half gold, half coal. The ethereal vocals on ""Wiseguy"" sweep into an ominous, cinematic ending, while ""Grand"" keeps the dreaminess throughout. The group incorporates subtle scratching on their tracks, which adds some texture to the overall mellowness, but doesn't necessarily detract from the main event. When the MCs take the stage on ""Witch of Trouble"" and ""Cutting Me Up,"" they don't fare as well, I'm afraid -- the hip-hop aspects then seem too contrived. But where they mix genres elsewhere, it comes off with more grace: the folksy guitars on ""Crushed"" meld with the heavier beats convincingly; the big band horns on ""Hollywood"" and the subdued funk bass on ""Hide"" add mystique. A strong effort, if imperfect."
4,Trip hop,"The sound is like the voice of Emiliana Torrini with tricky as a producer/back up singer on some songs. It is the definition of bristol sound, standard formula trip hop."
5,Classic Album from my college years ... hard to find.,Quick delivery and in very good condition. I appreciate being able to purchase this out of print album. If you like the Oak Ridge Boys you would love this.
4,A great album to listen to while doing nothing.,"This heavy, sometimes dark, layered album uses several combinations of sound in a largely droning and entrancing method. It's relaxing and comforting and I'm very happy that I purchased it."
3,The tail end of Neil's early commercial period.,"This was the album that began to close out the commercial clap-and-strum type hits of Neil Diamond's earlier style. It still contains a few songs of that style, including ""Two-Bit Manchild"" with an appealing riff, and ""Holiday Inn Blues"" with a Donovan type sound, but begins to move into deeper and more personal directions, especially with the excellent ""Brooklyn Roads,"" which is soft but beautiful. ""The Pot Smokers Song"" is a lousy piece of anti-drug propaganda that doesn't belong here at all. The album's decent overall, and worth getting for its non-hit songs."
3,"Gap Filler, Good Add On Collection Album","Neil's first UNI release, (now on MCA)bolts out of the gatewith three strong tunes, Two Bit Manchild, Modern Day Versionof Love and the overlooked Honeydrippin Times. After the awfulPotsmokers Song, 2 great wellknown tunes follow, Brooklyn Roadsand Shilo, which Neil recorded previously at Bang records and then re-recorded here for UNI. Then the good track Sunday Sun is next. However after Sunday Sun the rest of the album sounds dated, boring and forgetable. This album is worth having though and is a great gap filler and worth buying, just should not be a priority"
3,Big deception,"RAIDERS FOREVER was a big deception for me cause I buy the book to read about the greats moments of one of the greatest team of the NFL story,the Raiders of the 70's.I have a big surprise when I realise the book was a kind of short biography of each of the great players of that time.They talk about their years at high school,college,how they feel when they we're draft and a lot about their life after they retired from football.But I want to read about the games vs the Steelers,Chiefs or the Superbowl.I'm looking for Raiders memories not for the private life of the players.Mr.Lombardo talk about some highlights of the great moments of the team but talk too much about the players life off the field and not enough about what they did during the games."
3,Biographical Information,"While not a bad read, keep in mind that this book is primarily 18 individual mini-biographies of great Raiders players from the 70's compiled into one book. You will learn where they went to school, a little bit about their playing careers, and what they are up to now."
3,Not what the description is at all.....,"The description of these is wrong, wrong, wrong. the frequency response is only 20-20,000 hz, not 10- 20,000 hz. and the sensitivity is only 104 db not 108 db like the description also says. I have 3 different pair of in-ear headphones and I have tested them all to the same song and the same mp3 player and all of mine are the same. I have the following models: mdr-w08, mdr-w014 ?, and my new ones mdr-w25g. All of them are the same so don't spend the extra money like I did. They work great and are great but if you are expecting a better sound and response you will not get this from these compared to other sony in-ear headphones. I am a total Sony headphone geek, I love the quality. Just don't buy the most expensive as most ofthem are the same. Good luck."
3,"good headphones, short cord","Be warned that if you plan on using these while on a treadmill/eliptical trainer, etc.--the headphone cord will not reach from the machine to your head, so you have to be wearing your ipod/CD player (or move your ears out of your head?)"
1,Drop in quality,"I have used these headphones for a long time. I have occasionally had to replace them when I pulled the wires out of the speakers. The last two pairs were very brittle and broke easily just below the hinges, two pairs in three days. This has not been a problem until now (Feb 07) and previously I found these headphones to be perfect for my needs."
2,in ear headphones,I must have extremely small ears as the ear pieces do not fit comfortably in my ears
3,Sony MDRW25G,"they're okay for $14 headphones, i guess. they're not that comfortable, but sound quality is nice."
1,You get what you pay for with audio equipment,"The marketing of this mic suggests that it will pick up sounds across the room in a lecture hall. I bought it hoping that it would work for just that in my college classes. It is pathetic. Sitting on my desk about two feet from my mouth, it barely picks up the sound of my voice. I've had bad experiences with cheap mics in the sub $100 price range. So I'm paying more this time around with the Sony ECM MS957. I would reccomend not buying this one."
2,The Little Crossing Gate that Couldn't,"The presentation of this toy is great. It looks good in the box, and even when you open it. The problem arises when children, who are well within the age range play with it. It does not withstand ANY manual manipulation, which boys of this age are want to do. Once the gate is ""helped"" up or down at all it no longer raises or lowers on it's own. We were very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Good But a Lot Portuguese Mistakes!,Good effort and good intentions but need to be rewied and also get some ideas for change. Easy reading and a very good book for middle school students.
1,I am not surpised,"I am not surprised that these ""scientists"" are still trying to prove the existence of something that just is not there. Give up and just accept the fact that there is no God and the mind is capable of nearly anything to satisfy the percieved need of this elusive subject."
1,Not what I was hoping,"This book is a testament to what machinations the mind can create without a single shred of evidence. I can't beleive that the authors claim this book to be scientific! This book should be called, ""NeuroTheology, Pseudoscience, Spirituality and other Ridiculous Theories."" Rhawn Joseph blatantly disregards fundamental scientific evidence of darwinism to promote his ""intelligent design"" theory which is only a small modification of creationism (Instead of god, he has aliens.) Even the articles by scientists such as Newberg, that might have some scientific validity (at least the theories can be tested), are overshadowed by the new-age garbage. Any serious scientist searching for meaning and the understanding of religious experiences should avoid this book. I am apalled that scientists who consider themselves intelligent and reasonable would even associate themselves with this book."
1,if it makes you feel good to believe it...,"..then it must be true.'Proof' based on feelings/subjective perception... like seeing shapes in clouds: ""no no. that'sa sailboat, not a man with a beard; you must be crazy!!""Now that's the scientific method at work, eh?"
5,Open minds and scientific ones collide,"Joseph is attempting to explore the question of origins, specifically the question - the elephant in the room - that material science for some reason does not acknowledge as valid: what was before the 'beginning'? What triggered the whole process of material formation and physical evolution? Anyone satisfied with the answer 'nothing' (because it is unknowable?) is simply a reverse-new ager. If 'hard' science doesn't ask these questions then it has limited its own value."
2,BORING!,"All I can say is I stopped reading it after aboutthe tenth page, havent picked the book up since."
1,Cheap!!,Flimsy paper. I regret not reading these reviews before purchasing. Just wasn't what I expected when I got it.
2,It was OK,"Bought it as a gift, but it was a little too cheap looking to give as a gift. Pretty and sparkly, but very lightweight. Can't put it outdoors when windy. Still ok."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed when this item arrived. It is very flimsy and has no color to it. Don't waste your money on this.
1,Very disappointing,"I wish I'd seen the comments before I bought this. I was so disappointed when it was received. It is a laminated paper, it is NOT AT ALL as pictured appearing to be brightly colored metal..It is a cheap decoration that could be bought in the dollar store. It's a rip-off.Butterfly Spiral"
1,THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!,"I GOT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS ROOM, I'M TOO EMBARRASSED TO EVEN SEND IT TO HER. THIS IS A PLASTIC CELLOPHANE PIECE OF JUNK..YOU CAN GET THIS AT A DOLLAR STORE..IT LOOKS PRETTY IN THE PICTURE THOUGH."
1,Disappointment!,I haaaaaated this. I was disappointed. I bought it for my grandmother for christmas. Wish I woulda read the reviews first!
1,Horrible do not purchase,"This was going to be a gift for a girl I work with. When I received it I was shocked. It is plastic, and the beautiful colors it shows in the pictures, not sure where those are from. It is a silver color. Very disappointed."
1,need better product details,I really wish I would have read the reviewa before purchasing the product. When I recieved it today I was not expecting it to be made out of paper. I will now have to buy another gift to give along with this one so it does not appear that I am to cheap to give nice gifts.
1,horrible,how very disgusting yes so every one knows this is made out of paper and very cheap paper at that!!! very decieving!!!!!!!!!! very much not worth 7.00
1,It's made of paper!,I saw this was laser engraved and figured it was made out of lightweight metal or aluminum. It's made out of paper with a thin layer of clear laminate over it. It's definitely not worth 7 dollars.
1,Bent Merchandise,I received my item in a timely manner - but sadly the way it was shipped was in a plastic sort of bag. The item was bent up at some odd angles. I do not know if it was due to handling during shipment or from the company that way. The return process for this item is not convenient. I have called the company only to get nothing but automated service - unable to find a 'live' person to talk to. I emailed the company - but I had not gotten any sort of response from that. I will be mailing the package back to the company per the instructions that came with it for returns - at my OWN expense though. With no knowledge if I will be reimbursed for the returned shipping or not. My guess is not. I am disappointed in this item and will not be doing anymore online ordering from this company again.
1,"This is terrible, can I return it?",Lesson learned... I'll ALWAYS read the reviews before I purchase another item on Amazon. This was listed under windchimes and looked likes a lightweight metal hanging. It's pressed out of paper - looks horrible - can not be given as a gift! I'm going to check on the return policy on this one.
1,Worse thing I ever got,I am so unhappy with my purchase. I was expecting to have a beautiful Butterfly Spiral to give to my mother for Christmas and what I got was plastic. I feel that the picture does not represent the product. There should be some kind of description of this product. I have never been so unhappy with a purchase like this. Do not buy the butterfly spiral.
2,butterfly spiral,I just got it today....i was mad because it did not look like that picture that show glittering shiny spiral.>.<
2,oops,"I loved this product when I saw it online. However, when i recieved it I was a little disappointed, it's made out of paper not something more sturdy so you can hang it outside."
5,A Must Own Book for Serious Residential Do-It-Yourselfers,"This book is an excellent reference book for use in designing, planning, and building a new house or remodeling an existing one. Whenever I plan on doing something on the house, I double check with this reference before finishing my designs and plans. It's a must own book for serious do-it-yourselfers."
2,Bike Pump,"I am generally unhappy with this pump. It was suppose to make my life easier when inflating my bicyle tires, but instead its a hassle and you can't tell which way the pump is suppose to go, and whether the air is going in or not. And on the first try it burnt out my car dashboard fuses."
1,I should have read the reviews,"I should have read the reviews. Mine doesn't work at all. I plugged it into the adapter and when turning the switch, the adapter lights up giving me a good indication that there's power going to it, but no pumping happens. Dead machine. Is it worth packing it up, and bringing to the post office and pay $6 in postage for a $19 item? Next time I'll read the reviews."
4,Electric Bike pump,A good product but would be better if supplied with alligator clips to hook directly to a 12 volt battery.
1,Junk,Schwinn Electric Bike PumpCouldn't blow up a baloon. The cheap plastic nozzle broke off on first use.
3,"Not what I expected, but good","Are there 2 different recordings? The one I wanted was the one that included ""Book of Daniel,"" ""Oration,"" and ""Shesonahim."" The one I got had five tracks, including ""Children of Waco"" and ""April 19, 1993."" It includes some of Koresh's sermons interspersed with music and sound effects. Some of the speaking was very hard to understand because it was covered completely by the music. I like this recording, it just isn't what I thought I ordered, and now I have to find the other one."
2,2 Koresh CDs?,"Guess I bought the wrong David Koresh CD. I have Waco - Playing With Fire:1. Children Of Waco2. We're Supposed To Be Christians3. The Rise & Fall Of The Branch Davidians4. The Book Of Revelation/The Seven Seals5. April 19, 1993This CD is garbage synth music with very badly dubbed in David Koresh speech snippets."
3,Cheap hardware,Third time I used it the braces came off. They saved a dime by supplying cheap hardware. Otherwise it works okay.
3,Garelick Roof Snow Rake,"The Garelick 21'L Roof Snow Rake is great for fluffy, new snow. After the snow has packed a bit and becomes ""wet"" the snow rake becomes an exhaustive exercise. For the heavy snow I bought a snow knife, but have not had the opportunity to try it out."
1,Design and quality of roof rake,"We've only used this once in Northern Minnesota,, but the angle of the pole and wheels were very good. Rolled over the shingles easily without scraping them and pulled the snow down without difficulty."
3,"Bought to Keep in Reserve, Have Not Used Yet","I bought this unit to have it on hand, in case I need to use it. Last winter, I had ice dams and the melt caused water to come into the house via the top of the windows--and it was too late to buy a rake locally.I will edit the review when I have had a chance to use it. But, to have it on hand just in case is comforting."
3,21 foot long pole hard to handle,The 21 ' length is very hard to manuever up towards a roof. I am re-ordering the 16 foot length. This is all I have to comment at this time.
2,Not so good.,I've used this product twice since I've bought it and it has worked well to pull the snow off the roof. I usually only have 2 or 3 poles attached and stand on a ladder. That is what works best for me.*** Update ***Well after using it for a year I finally decided to give up on the idea of raking snow off my roof. Just too tedious especially with two valleys involved. I've switch to heat cables and am much happier with the results. This product is just too clumsy and cumbersome to use over time.
4,It works,"It works, but it's kinda cheap. The wheels are a pain to get on. I had to wedge something in the slot on them to get them to fit onto the rake. The spring buttons on the rods are difficult and stiff to use. The poles also flex like crazy, which isn't really a problem but it makes me nervous. Overall I'm happy with it, I just wish assembling and disassembling the rods were a little more easy, especially with gloves on."
1,Never got the product,"I ordered this from TOBY'S TOOL SHED....never received any status updates, ended up calling them 3 weeks later to find out they were sold out, yet I heard nothing about it. TERRIBLE customer service. Look elsewhere."
1,Terrible,"Product came in a way too large broken box with pieces missing. I have had NO RESPONSE from Amazon about this, I spent 51.99 and there is no paperwork with it, nothing. Some one could at least contact me about this, this has been by far my worst online ordering experience ever!!"
5,Garelick 21 foot Roof Rake,"I purchased this from Amazon with priority shipping and the transaction was excellently executed. The roof rake worked as advertised. It is both light in weight and sturdy. I was pulling approximately 27 inches of wet, rain soaked snow from my roof with no bad consequences to the tool. The wheels on the blade were a plus, I had no damage to my shingles.It was shared in my neighborhood, nobody had a bad thing to say. Well worth it."
5,Great product,Works like it is supposed to. One might want to substitute the nylon tipped lock nuts rather than the nuts and lock washers supplied.
2,"Shoddy, but will do the job.","I picked this snow rake up from my local Ace; it was the last one for 20 miles. It does the job, but within the three days I've had to fix it multiple times. Both of the bolts on the diagonal supports that come off the main pole have broken off and have had to be replaced by decent ones from my local hardware store along with some lock-nuts (these have stayed on). The blade of the rake has a bend in it where I pulled on some ice trying to break it free. The rubber grip comes off if you pull on it alone.Seeing how expensive roof rakes are, you'd figure Garelick would spring for an extra buck in the construction phase and put better nuts and bolts on it -- that alone would have raised my rating a star or two.After the repairs (which cost me just about a buck) it does it's job of getting snow off the my roof, so I can't complain **too** much."
4,Works ok but would rate higher with better locknuts,"It works for one story within about 4' or so of the edge while standing on level ground. Maybe a ladder could be used, but I didn't try. I didn't buy any 5' extensions, but can imagine that only one more 5' extension would be practical due to flexing of the 20' rake handle as it is. The lock washers were not sufficient (lost a nut after an hour use) and I suggest buying lock nuts with nylon inserts to more permanently fasten the rake head together. I recommend this rake with the lock nut caveat."
4,Works great,"Just used this on our 12/12 pitch roof at home after getting a 35"" blizzard in Connecticut. I had a 4-5 foot drift of snow sitting right up on the ridge. It held up great- being aluminum, I was worried something would eventually break. The extensions are good- although when cold and getting ice on them, them don't always seperate easily. The little rollers on the bottom of the blade are really great, prevents shigle damage. My gutters will live to see another blizzard and no massive icicles!"
4,Winter in WI 07-08,"Simple out of box instructions, easy to store, appears to be sturdy enough even at full length. A bit pricey."
2,Disappointed,Purchased this item and was disappointed in the construction. Did NOT hold up well at all...only used it a couple of times before it fell apart!!!!!
2,wish i didnt,"yes it pulls down snow, but doesnt get to the house face. i still have to reach out my windows and shovel the snow off the roof, although less. Also, the plastic pieces that go on the scraper part to protect the roof is crap. i used pipe insulation instead. Product not very good, but not complete garbage."
4,What I expected,"- Fairly easy to assemble if you follow the instructions- Blade itself is nice and wide and has some weight to it making it able to cut into the snow- Extension feels a little flimsy with all the lengths attached, but it surprisingly worked well- Aluminum is probably better than plastic so I went with this version vs cheaper plastic snow rakes- So far so good!"
5,Aluminum Snow roof rake,"This product actually works well. I used it after the blizzard of 2010 in the DC area. I used it after I already had ice dams on my roof more than a week after the 2 snow storms were over. It was very effective at getting the dampened snow off my roof. Of course it doesn' cut through ice dams. . I didn't notice damage to my shingles with using this product. The rake didn't fall apart either, it held up under the weight of the snow I was pulling. Be prepared to shovel all that snow that you pull down off your roof! I have a rambler so I didn't have to use all of the pole attachments. The rake handle has some flexibility to it when extended with the extra lengths of poles. Assembly was not hard either, the directions were easy to follow. I recommend it especially if you have an older home or one that doesn't have proper air sealing and insulation in the attic."
4,Works Great!,"Like others have said, do yourself a favor and replace the hardware before using. After that is taken care of, it works awesome and is a breeze to use, especially with the rollers. I would have given 5 stars except for the shoddy hardware."
5,No more Ice Dams,"Purchased this snow rake in mid-December 2010 just in time for an unusually early snow fall here in lower Michigan. Handled 6"" of wet snow with ease, and since purchased a second for my Mother. Would recomend this Rake to anyone who is afraid of ruining their shingled roof, I have dimensional shingles and thought that there might be a problem with the rollers but there was not."
2,Not as advertised,"The rake I received did not easily ""snap"" together as illustrated. This is not an Amazon problem, but a manufacturer's problem with the description they provide for this item. I am returning it because I do not want to bolt four lengths of tubing together every time I need to use the rake. The bolts are rather weak and would require stainless substitutions for any real use."
2,Nice enough except for the lock nuts that drive you nuts instead of locking,"The lock nuts all worked loose in less than an hour forcing me to stop and replace them one by one.It is a shame, as it is mostly a nice looking product, but having it repeatedly fall apart in your hands is frustrating with any product, but especially one you are likely to be using outside in bad weather."
5,Made In USA!!,"Most of the snow roof rakes I've used in the past had flimsy blades and a lot of bend to the 2-piece handles. The gauge on this blade is significantly thicker than anything I've used before, and even with the handle separated into 5 pieces there's much less bend to the overall length. Reading last winter's reviews of this rake, I think Garelick took some complaints to heart because it no longer has bolts with lock washers, now it has machine screws with lock nuts. I'm still going to check the tightness of all the nuts after a couple uses, but I don't feel a need to run to the store and replace all the hardware. Overall this seems to have the strength and quality I want in a Made In US product, and I'm happy I bought it."
4,Homeowner,The product arrived on time and in good shape. I did follow another reviewer's recommendation to change out the hardware with stainless steel; it worked great! I have no problem recommending this product.
1,not for publication,"This is not a review at all...but, since you allow no other space for comments, I'm using this facility.I'm the artist, and I wonder why on earth you bother stocking this record when you begin its listing with a negative review from 'The Rough Guides' - the writer in question was only doing their job by writing what they did, and I respect their right to say what they like, but, really, what purpose does it serve for you to publish it as prominently as you do?If you endorse the sentiments of the writer, take the damn record out of your catalogue, because nobody will buy it from you as things stand."
3,It put me to sleep and woke me up,"Besides Yaconelli and McLaren, thirteen different people share their frustration with the modernistic church and how they escaped the discontent. While the book contained some great insights - James Engel's view of evangelism, for example - I was pretty bored through about half of the book. What is to be expected when you have so many different writers? Perhaps this is one point of postmodernism - everyone's stories will not be exciting, and that is okay. Honestly, I bought the book because of McLaren and Yaconelli, but they weren't so much the players in the game as they were the announcers at the game. If you are discontent with boring, businesslike christianity, this book will share some real-life stories and, possibly, give you some hope that all Christians aren't the same. Don't buy it for a definition of postmodernism or for Yaconelli's name. For Yaconelli-likers, look into Dangerous Wonder or Messy Spirituality - two great thought-challenging books."
3,It gets better,"When I started this novel, I wanted to burn it in a firepit within the first 50 pages. The redundancy just drove me nuts (should I open the letter? No I shouldn't. But I can't resist the letter. Should I open the letter? No I shouldn't. But I can't resist the letter.. you get the idea). At this point I was so annoyed I just wanted to tell her open the damned letter and call it a day. I put down my book and said I would continue in a few days.As I continued the story, it actually got better and funnier. The heroine is quite likeable, as is the man that she is in love with. I find ""Little Whitie Lies"" to be another wanna-be Sophie Kinsella novel, but in reality I don't mind that too much. If you can manage to get past the first 50 pages, you may actually enjoy the book."
2,A wimpy superficial protagonist!,"I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought this book. The later reviews were more accurate at depicting this book. At least it was for me. I found the protagonist, Natalie Raglan, to be wimpy, ditsy, superficial, and extremely indecisive. She rambled on and on about what she was doing wrong but never took any action to fix it. She seemed to repeat the same sentence over and over again. Towards the middle of the book, I found myself just reading the first sentence of each paragraph just to get through it. I had a very hard time connecting with Natalie and understanding her decision making.I gave this 2 stars because the storyline was cute and if it was better written, and if it had a stronger protagonist, it could have been much much better.I usually love books that are light and breezy, but that doesn't mean it has to be brainless."
1,So bad I can't finish it!,"I've picked this book up at least 3 times to try and finish it and it is just so BORING I have to keep putting it down. A good story makes you want to keep reading it and maybe even finishing it as soon as you can. This story is just not well told. It drags on a bit and the characters aren't hero material. Same goes for her other book, ""When in Rome"". I picked these due to the funny caricatures on the cover and the storyline sounded like it was going to be a fun read. Not so! I cannot recommend this book. Try the Sophie Kinsella books for good Brit Chic Lit."
3,"Good, but...",I liked this book but felt myself becoming slightly impatient with wanting to just find out what happens with Natalie. The characters were great and the writing was good but I gave it a 3 because I got a bit bored a little more than halfway through. But it won't stop me from checking out her other books...
1,horrible,"This book is horrible. I did not even finish reading it. I really struggled to get to chapter 10, and could not make it through. The main character is an idiot. She keeps herself in horrible lying situations. Do not get this book, I wish I could get my money back for it. I just decided to try this new author and I think this will be the first and last book of hers I order."
1,Frustrating,"One of the things I find almost impossible to believe is that a woman can paint another to woman to be so morally and ethically devoid of any character whatsoever. Yes, I've wanted to be someone else. Yes, I've moved around the country in search of myself. But even though it's fiction, I can't think of any situation that would allow most woman to lose their self-respect to the degree of the class-less main character. It shouldn't be titled: ""Litte White Lies"". It should be titled: ""Dishonesty For Advanced the Student."""
5,Warm and funny,"I loved this book from the moment I opened the cover. Natalie is someone who wants to do the right thing but things just don't go her way and in a moment of weakness she does something she shouldn't. I liked this book because it was funny and you really emphathise with the main character and the plot keeps you turning the pages. I'd recommend this for a lazy Sunday afternoon's read, or at the beach."
3,I can't remember a worse December.,"This album features Hollywood actors singing songs from Hollywood movies or television programs. There is a mix of older songs and newer songs. The songs are all sung well, but most of the newer songs aren't very good, especially the ones fromHome AloneandHome Alone 2. The best performance is probably ""I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm"" by Vicki Lewis (hey, I saw her inDamn Yankees). There are some good songs here, but the weaker songs drag the CD down."
5,These hit hard,These subs hit..i had them hooked up to a 900 rms soundstream amp in my old jetta.. they took the extra power no problems used to hear me coming from 2 blocks away
3,Its so so,"The subs are fantastic! They hit hard and take 1200 watts like a champ! The only downfall (reason for three stars) is the box will not withstand the sound pressure of full wattage. I blew this boxes ports within three days of owning it. I guess you get what you pay for, just put the subs in a different box and you are good to go!"
1,Time and Chance,"Being a professional who works in the world of words, I know I am picky about language, but I felt this book threw in crude language just because the author was too lazy to be more creative in how he might get his message across. The concept of the split personalities was very interesting. Possibly everyone has wondered what their life might have been like had they chosen a different road. Both sides of Richard/Rick found that neither life was perfect, both held challenges and rewards. Learning to be happy with the road you have chosen and making the most of it is truly the lesson of life."
5,Deserves a screen play!,"Time and Chance. The title alone fills the mind with excitement and wonder. Brennert's idea is captivating, unusual, and makes you think. It makes you wonder What if I did one thing, and not the other? What if I chose one but later in life I can go back and change my decision? You go through life and you wonder what would happen if you left a minute earlier- Would you have been involved in that accident? This novel gives you that sense of uneasiness that is so great. The character ""Richard"" is the perfect person to work this rounabout with..."
5,"So far, so good.","I purchased this book for the purpose of passing the language reading requirement for my graduate program. I am using it in conjunction with taking an accelerated summer French for reading course, and have found it very helpful. The review exercises and reading passages are interesting, while the explanations are generally clear. The only two things is first I might fault it for is some odd choices in arranging the chapters, but if you skip ahead it really doesn't matter. Second, a verb chart with regular and irregular verbs and their conjugations would have been nice, but the internet and a really good dictionary can take care of that, too."
3,"Dry, but effective","I needed to brush up on my reading French, and I bought this book.I think it's an effective method ... the author introduces the grammar a little at a time, and provides anywhere from 10 to 25 sentences to illustrate the grammatical points. It's a programmed type of approach; each French sentence is accompanied by the English translation (you cover up the English until you've translated the French).If you work conscientiously through the entire book, you'll have a sound knowledge of written French. (not spoken French, written French)Two negatives: some of the material is dry and dated. Which isn't too bad - if you assimilate the patterns and the grammar, you'll be able to apply them to more current material. The second drawback is the price. Sixty bucks for a PAPERBACK??!! Granted, it's a thick book, but come on, people. Twenty five or thirty dollars would be a fairer price.If money is no object, you'll do well with this book."
1,Poorly organized with major editing mistakes,"This book has a number of very serious problems that impede language learning. First, the language is not presented in a coherent fashion (e.g. concepts are introduced in exercises but not explained until several chapters later). Second, typographical errors abound in some very unfortunate places. Several chapters include illustrative examples with accompanying translations that are incorrect, thereby confusing the student. Third, the exercises are repetitive to the point that very little is accomplished in a given chapter in terms of developing a student's vocabulary and ability to handle real French. Finally, the five-page-long appendix falls far short of the reference needs of the average user of this book. The table of verbs is hard to follow and incomplete, and there are no accompanying tables of adjectives, comparatives, etc. My advice is to buy a different book."
5,This purchase went as I had hoped.,The book came in timely fashion and was in the condition described. I'm happy that I made the decision to buy this book - it will be very helpful to me.
2,Read this,"I saw this book @ amazon with the review stating 'this book saved me $$$', then yesterday i saw it @ borders and read through it. i think for the money you could buy a dictionary for your pc and a basic grammar and read stuff on the internet with better results. this review said it saved money bc every1 knows this book is an overpriced dust magnet."
1,BAD Product,"This a very BAD product, did not even work for a full hour. Got a replacement, but got same result. DO NOT buy this product."
3,Wrong size,Unfortunately the size was misleading as this item would not fit my English Bulldog which is heavy chested and ways close to 70lbs. To return item is not feasible due to shipping cost.
5,Next best thing!,"Next best thing to being there, especially if you can't get to his concert! I loved it. It includes interviews and other stuff too, like JJ surfing with friends. Worth it!"
3,Horrible sound mix.,"The only reason that I gave this three stars is because you do actually get to see Jack live. The mix is horrible! The California shows you can barely hear the band because of the crowd noise, and the shows in Japan are dominated by the bass. I expected much more."
4,great DVD,I like the way it shows the life of being on tour as well as the performing on stage. I keeo it in my car and watch it while on lunch or waiting in the school pickup lane on fridays
2,Nice but I hate the interuptions between songs.,"Jack is enjoyable as ever but I bought the DVD's to hear music, not their little anecdotes between songs. I like the option to turn the commentary off, however, this DVD doesn't afford you the opportunity to do this. Yes, I want to hear their thought too, but not everytime I put the disk on."
4,Konichiwa,If you like jack Johnson albums then this is for you because its those songs plus a few more live.
2,"Music...wait, no...babble...wait, no music...errrrrr...","I absolutely enjoy JJ's music, however, I absolutely do not enjoy hearing part of a live song then a cut to some band member talking about nothing then back to part of another live song. Show the full concert without the babble and save the discussion for the extras. The audience singing along to the songs isn;t that bad and brings you into the atmosphere of the evening, however, the sound could have been better."
1,Poor Sound Quality is Unacceptable,"I am a huge Jack Johnson fan. I listen to his 3 albums over and over again. The sound quality on this recording is horrific. I figured that spending a few bucks on a concert video is less than buying an expensive concert ticket. Well, I suppose the old axiom is true, ""you get what you pay for."" I didn't pay much for this video, and I did't get much either."
2,Crushed!,The bearer of bad news. I have to say that I am a huge fan of Jack Johnson and brushfire fairytales has to be my favorite album with sexy plexi and flake being real 5.1 recordings. With that in mind the DVD does not have alot of the instruments used in alot of tracks and most noticeably the two just mentioned. There is no bongo drums on flake and other songs the overall acoustics is poor and the picture is no better. If you would like more insight about Jacks travels this you would like but if you enjoy a compelling and a feel like your there performance this regreatfully is not the one for you. It is almost like he had hired a friend to record this concert and documentary. A novice production.
5,Great gift for my husband!,I bought this gift for my husband for Christmas! He loves it! He says its the best tool bag he's ever owned. He likes all the little pockets and spaces for his tools. He says it has a spot for everything. It is used regularly and is holding up well. Very good quality and very sturdy!
4,good,Not exactly what i was expecting but it works has plenty of room and pockets and a place to keep rolls of tape and my tape measurer
3,"Issue is with center ""parts bin"" design","This bag is not too bad, but it's downfall is the center tray design. If you have all your tools arranged like they want to, and you remove the center ""parts bin"" to grab a wire nut, the side of the bag with all the loops for your tools just collapse into the center. Not very good. I figured the sides would have had some better supports. I bought this bag because of the size of the center parts bin container it could hold. Beware, don't get this bag if you are planning to use the part bin frequently."
4,good bag,I go through lots of these bags and this one has not shown itself to be poorly constructed in the first five minutes as most do.The plastic organizer in the middle has proven to be cvery useful as well. I'm not thrilled with the tool layout but just to have a bag that doesn't start unraveling as you pick it ur the first timeis a major improvement over what I've purchased in the past.
3,Great tool bag,"Great bag. Excellent quality and perfect size. Not too big or small. Only gripe is that the straps inside the big compartments are a bit small for anything. I mean the straps to keep certain tools upright. At least for me, they are useless. Overall I am very happy with the purchase.update: After using this bag for some time. I am retiring it as a main bag and re purposing it as a gadget bag. Too small, just does not work as an everyday tool bag. It collapses in on itself. Tools get caught. May work for others but not for the tools that I use regularly."
5,What else is there to be said?,"""Decisions on the Rules of Golf"" is a combination of the USGA's official ""Rules of Golf"" along with the most recent questions and challenges to the rules in a convenient Q & A format. While the decisions get deeply involved at times, for a true lover of the sport it makes for an excellent 'casual read', regardless of one's playing ability. The text's small profile will fit into almost any golf bag for quick reference on the course, and the print is large enough so as not to alienate anybody seeking the correct answer to their golf question. This is the official and most current word to be found on golf. Outstanding!"
3,Adequate product,"This is an adequate goggle for recreational swimmers. It comes with three bridges so you can adjust it to fit. The suctions eyes grip and keep out all but miscroscopic amounts of water. The wide band is very good and adjusts for a good fit.The view underwater could be better, however. I noticed my water vision was very blurry in freestyle. During backstroke, I had blurred vision in the top of the goggle so I wasn't always sure when I was back to the front of the pool.These are not serious problems, however. This product is pretty good and should satisfy most swimmers looking for a combination of style, color, waterfast fit and performance."
2,"Good product, poor quality control","This product works well by providing a massive caffeine dose via caffeine and caffeine-derived herbs. Half a bottle is usually all it that is needed, which is good because it tastes horrible. Unfortunately the cheap/poor quality of the plastic bottle enables the product to spoil on the shelf, and also makes it difficult to cleanly remove the lid. To make matters worse, the company doesn't answer their phone nor reply to email, therefore if you buy this product online it just becomes more of a headache to deal with. I've found other products with nearly identical ingredients that taste better and cost less."
4,Rosemary & Thyme-Series 2,I enjoyed and liked very much to watch all the episodes in this series. The quality of the DVD is excellent. I recommend this series to those who are fond of mystery films.
4,fun,"Lazy afternoon fun....and a little murder. Smart, gentle and addicting...and you might learn something about flowers. What more could one ask for?"
3,RoseMary and Thyme,"These are nice, light mystery stories with lots of information about gardening, flowers etc. All British of course."
5,A mystery with charm,"If you love a good mystery with 2 charming, complex gals this is for you!The fact that they are into gardening at its best in the country they are working in....... whether U.K or somewhere in Europe is an added attraction to the mystery.Both of these actresses are prominent in their homeland which makes the acting excellent."
5,An Incredible Nail-Biting Film!!!,"""Duel"" has to be, by far, one of the best films made to date! It was the first feature film directed by a then unknown by the name of Steven Spielberg.The story revolves around a man who is on his way to an important business meeting. In his haste to get to his destination, he come face to face with a slow-moving truck. He passes the truck and everything is fine. The truck then decides to pass him again and slow down, again hindering his progress. What comes next is a film filled with chases and suspense. The coolest thing about the movie is that you never find out the identity of the driver of the truck. This leads you to believe that it's the truck, not the driver, who is causing all of this havoc.This movie will have you glued to the screen, and the climactic conclusion is incredible!!![.] I would highly suggest this film to anyone who wants to see great movie-making and an unbelievable story!!![.]"
4,Passing Game,"Even after 30 years of heavy lifting as a director this is still the only legitimately great film to be credited to Steven Spielberg. His great technical facility was entirely suited to this allegory about road rage in the desert. Richard Matheson, who occasionally ascended to moments of real greatness as a scriptwriter for ""Twilight Zone"" and similar projects, did the stripped down scenario, and it's a fine piece of work."
5,I love this movie !,"I`ve probably seen this movie a thousand times over the last 27 years and I still love it! Dennis Weaver is perfectly cast and very convincing as the distressed businessman relentlessly pursued by the crazy trucker.I especially like the seen toward the end where it really gets suspenseful when the trucker is barreling down on Dennis Weaver and hes panic-stricken as his plymouth valiant overheats,trying to stall out on him and billowing clouds of smoke out of the tailpipe! cool! This is a suspense classic and truly american!"
1,From a different angle,"Sorry, but this was a TOTAL waste of time. I watched because I like Dennis Weaver. He must have been out of work for a while to bother. HIS acting was good as always; but the story, the plot, the whole thing was DUMB, DUMB! No one driving 80 or 100 miles an hour TURNS around and looks at the road behind. The car would be in the ditch and flipped. When people talk about REAL in films the filmmakers think we mean blood and goar...try common sense for a change! After the events of the past few days (Sept. 11, 2001) maybe we should go back to the popular romance films of the War years. I can't believe so many people thought this was good! Guess that's why they make chocolate AND vanilla ice cream! If I could say ZERO stars I would but I had to give it one to submit this review!"
3,SUSPENSE,THIS MOVIE ROCKS! IT'S FUNNY IN ITS OWN LITTLE WAY. I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT GET BORED WITH THIS 1971 CLASSIC. THE WHOLE MOVIE IS AMAZINGLY DONE. FOR IT IS SO MUCH OF A LOW BUDGET MOVIE ITS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT VERY LITTLE DIALOUGE BUT ANY TALKING IN IT IS USEFUL BECAUSE ITS A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE SO FAR THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
2,not good!!!,Picture kept having a green line where it looked like it was spliced together through the whole movie....looked old too.
3,Enjoyed Spielberg's first commercial motion picture.,"While the movie is a little rough around the edges and can be a little ""clunky"" that may be part of its charm. What I enjoyed most about the film is the fact that this is an ""everyman"" kind of protaganist. Also, I love the fear of the unkown. You never see more than the truck driver's arm at most. The tension peaked in my opinion when Dennis Weaver is in the diner and suspicious of every other customer. He has no clue who the enemy is (nor do we). The reason why my rating is only at three stars is the fact that I still can't seem to find the actual truck all that scary. This would be corrected in a few years with JAWS.Overall, I would recommend to anyone who is a Spielberg fan."
3,Duel,Dennis Weaver plays the role of a business commuter driving in the mountains while an unseen insane truckdriver trying to kill him.This movie maybe disturbing for some viewers.
5,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-!,The book was written by Richard Matheson and Ray Bradbury(Two great writers who are now in the Science Ficton hall of fame) and then made into a movie by the great Steven Spielberg(Director of E.T. The Extraterrestrial and Schindler's List.)So this is amazing.
4,"Not to mention, I drive a red car to :-o","I decided to buy this ole classic film, for one reason I never really saw the movie all the way through, one reason is I wasn't even born yet when this movie came out. So I never got to see the beginning of it becuase when I saw it on TV one day in the early 90's the movie was half way over. Anyways this is a good movie, and it makes you kinda think about road rage to a 3 degree. I drive a little red 1997 honda civic coop, two door car. I rarely go on the interstate, well becuase where I live I dont need to go on the interstate really, but I do live in a small town in south Georgia, alot of long roads through farm land etc. And trucks like this one in the movie are always seen. But back to this movie its worth adding to your collection."
5,Dual,GREAT MOVIE!!! I loved it!! And the service was great!!!!! I recommend this movie to all the people that love old and action movies! It was very a good suspenseful movie!!! :
2,We anticipated much better even froma young Spielberg.,"This one got rave reviews from friends who recommended it. However, I found it VERY long and ridiculous. The plot did not grab me. In fact, everything the main character did served to aggravate me. We now know why Spielberg only became famous after later movies. He learned from his early mistakes."
2,Not impressed....,"I'm sorry people this movie was boring to me. I purchase it as an xmas gift for my brother without ever having watched it. I was going by what a coworker told me, that it was really good, one of the best. The movie is just really quiet, no one ever talks. It's so unrealistic, when was the last time a road rage driver followed you for 30 minutes or more? Hardly. They might follow you 5 or 10 minutes but most will just pass you and be like, 'C' Yah'.The whole movie is just about some trucker, whom you never see his face, who apparently gets enraged by the driver having cut him off or driving too slow and he follows him throughout the movie. I think the best part was at the end when the truck flipped, blood spilled from the side of the truck, you knew the driver had died or was hurt seriously, but even better, the movie was ending."
2,Not so good,"How can anybody say this is a good movie and stillhave a straight face? The acting isn't the bad, andit had the potential to be decent if it had a storyline to go along with the suspense!What's the point of the movie? Why is the truckdriver so mentally gone? Not only that, why is Chestersuch a complete wimp. This movie is like a big bullyboring a weak nerd. How am I even supposed to care aboutDennis Weaver in this? His character is simply so weakthat I have to root againest him. I'm not going to cheerfor cowards!The movie is also simply too repetetive! It could havebeen good if Dennis Weaver had been given more to workwith."
1,WHAT WAS HE THINKING??,"I understand that this was Steven Spielberg's first movie, but WHAT ON EARTH possessed him to make such a plotless piece of crap??Seriously, the movie has no plot WHATSOEVER. Sure, it is psychological but he could have chosen to show the insecurities that we have in our minds in a more substantial way. The plot, for instance, could be more realistic and definitely more meaningful. Sorry Steven, but in this you definitely do NOT cut the chase.Another movie of Spielberg's that made no sense to me was Close Encounters of The Third Kind. Do NOT watch this, people...you can't say I didn't warn you!"
3,solid movie,"i discovered this movie just over a year ago from a List of Great car chase movies. picked up an ole vhs copy from my video store. its a great late night watcher, oh, and to correct a previous reviewer, its a plymouth, not a pontiac. wanna check out this dvd, seems their is no trailer included in it. o well. peace out"
4,"Intriguing,suspensful,dramatic to the end.","Another masterpiece by genius director Steven Spielberg.A film that keeps you captivated and glued to your seat fromstart to finish.Full of suspense,intrigue and drama. One of my all time favourites."
4,sticks out in your mind,"I remember seeing this movie a couple of times before I could drive. It is one of those movies that sticks out in your mind. It's kind of funny that as kids, my brothers and I would always pretend in the car that we were in a race with the other cars while our father was driving. We would become truly upset if some other cars passed us. Well, I guess other people have played the same game but have never grown out of it. The truck driver in Duel must be one of those people. Duel is a supreme road game that is caught on film for all of us voyeurs. Suspensful to the max, it will keep you hooked until its over. You keep trying to get a look at the truck driver but never do. I will never forget the ""animal"" sounds that the truck makes as it is ""dying."" Could your enemy really be the truck itself that has a mind of its own? What an awesome effect! I never knew Spielberg was the director until now. No wonder it was so memorable."
4,I Love This Show!,"Ok, this is an old show however it is just great. Steven Spielberg, who never fails to disappoint us, delivers to us in Duel. No big cast..... only Dennis Weaver ( giving a good performance ) taking a road trip by himself when he finds himself in a cat and mouse game with a crazed man driving a diesel truck. This movie is entertaining from beginning to end... it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next. Though you can tell this was a low budget movie, I think Spielberg did a great job. Duel takes you on one man's nightmare road trip!! Definetly worth seeing."
4,HOLDS UP WELL,"I've seen this film several times, and it never fails to draw me in and keep me on the edge of my seat. For a TV movie, the technical mastery present is amazing. The camerawork, the sound effects, the editing are all superlative, and the pacing is perfect. Consider the challenge: Speilberg and Matheson had to take an extremely thin premise--businessman pursued/terrorized by trucker--and get ninety minutes out of it. Adding to the challenge, the main characters can't communicate with one other, and the central character is by himself, so the opportunities for dialogue are pretty spare. Which is what makes this a masterpiece more than anything else. Spielberg was forced to tell the story visually, almost as a silent film (although the sound effects add quite a lot to the tension).Overall an intelligent, though-provoking film."
5,"Caaaandycaaaane . . . Sorry, wrong film.",Really great movie. Lot's of tension and suspense. Not the way you want a cross-country trip to go. Shows what you can do without spending a lot of money on special effects and elaborate sets. Not even much dialogue. Loads of atmosphere. This movie is a classic. Great portrayal by Dennis Weaver. Anyone else think Joy Ride and the beginning of Jeepers Creepers was influenced by this?
5,Great Movie You'll Watch It Again And Again!,"this is one of my favorite movies,one that i watch over and over.but i only have one question, does anyone know when dennis weaverpasses the truck and he looks back and gives some kind of fingersignal was that a wave? or was he flipping the driver off? well anyway, this is a great movie you have a business man going toa meeting while on the road he passes a Driver of a Semi soonto find out the driver playing a game of ""Cat And Mouse"".but we have a few shots of the driver alittle hard to see who this guy is.i dont think he was in the Cafe at all, but the semi was there so im guessing there was some sort of store or something next to the cafe i think he was in there(not the cafe)since he was not in the truck.The Man in the cafe the one with the brown shirt i think he would been a perfect match as the driver.Well Overall,Great Movie A peace of art!"
2,Who the real star is. NOT Spielberg.,This is a great movie because and Only because of actor Dennis Weaver.I doubt it would have been as good without him. Spielberg should belaying flowers at his grave along with a really FAT check. If StevenSpielberg owes anybody a debt of thanks its to the fine actor GUNSMOKE'sDennis Weaver.
2,Lathargic.,"This plotting suspense thriller should have been edited into a half hour Twilight Zone. Like the chasing truck, it just keeps going on and on for no apparent reason."
5,"A Masterpeice! ""Duel"" is among Speilberg's BEST!","In 1970, CBS handed a 23 year-old kid named Steven Speilberg a script, a cast and crew, and a minimal budget to create a simple ""Made-for-TV-Movie"" called DEUL. Speilberg, then a young, no-name Director, assembled the BEST ""Made for TV movie"" EVER SEEN! With a virtually one-man-cast, a few thousand bucks, and a lame premise to go on, Speilberg's directing genious and knowlege in suspense, makes this movie among his best! A must see for any die-hard Speilberg fans, or if you just LOVE a great suspense-thriller! Buy it NOW!"
3,A little dissapointed,For 2 guys who had a lot to do with KISS this fell short for me. I do have to admit though I'm a stickler for details. I hated the tab. I like the actual music notes with tab. The video is helpful but... My suggestion is buy a complete tab book and watch a live video. I think I've learned more that way than with this video.
4,Shadows on the sea,"Shadows on the Sea is a book about a girl staying with her Nana while her mom is traveling to visit her sick and dying uncle. While she is there, she starts finding clues and things that she thinks might have to do with the war that is going on. So her and her friends start to investagate it.I would definitly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading adventure mysteries.I have also enjoyed reading other books by this author as well.All in all this was a wonderful book about a girl that,in a small way,contributed to the horrible war that was taking place in that time."
5,Absolutely a must have DVD for goalkeepers,"I purchased this DVD over a year ago and gave it to my goalkeepers to watch, but didn't really watch it myself until my own son decided he wanted to try being a goalkeeper. We watch it together a lot these days and I must say I am really very impressed. I have played and coached soccer for over 35 years and this is an awesome training dvd. It is well paced, has great photography, and is very clear and straight forward. I tried to find some flaws in it, but could not find anything I did not agree with throughout the entire 2 DVDs."
4,Good starter video for basic for the starter parent coach,"This video does a great job going over some basics. Granted some positions and skills are not what i would teach but we should never limit ourselves to one resource, camp or coach to learn."
4,Noise suppressor,Took out a lot of noise in my HAM radio that I have installed in my truck. It is worth the money.
1,Arrived Broken,"When I took this product out of its shipping container, one of the leads that is supposed to be soldered onto the PC board fell off. In addition to that, there is a loose screw rattling around inside the plastic case. I can't tell you if it works well or not. I'll probably open it up and solder the lead back on and remove the screw myself. In the meantime I am using another product.10A Noise FilterIt works well except for side band reception on my CB. I'm still getting ignition noise there."
4,Needs a Press Agent!,"This little guy needs a press agent! As indicated in other reviews, it makes some unexpected sound, but it is not loud or offensive. It ejects disks robustly, but not a problem. The case appears to be durable to me. Regarding system requirements, the package says, ""Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 will not support non-Iomega USB devices while Iomega drivers are installed."" It might be wise to check for the latest operating system support information. It would be nice if the Zip disk in it could be ejected after the system is off, like the external floppy disk drive that comes with some laptop computers."
3,"Nice addition for laptop, but....","I bought this for my IBM laptop because I needed an easily portable storage device. I have one interchangeable bay on the laptop that is currently occupied by a DVD and did not want to swap it out with the floppy drive whenever I needed to store something on a disk. I already had a number of zip disks and a zip drive on my desktop on hand and did not want to reinvest in the microdrives and adapters from IBM or the pocketzip even though they have the advantages of more memory (340 MB to 1 GB) and smaller size. It is easy to carry in my bag and does not need a separte power source. However, it feels flimsy, and I am worried that one good hit or fall will render it useless. I realize that a fall or one good hit will also do in my laptop. I also worry about the longevity of the device because of its flimsy feel. My current zip drive has been operating flawlessly for 5 years, and I can only hope that this will last just as long."
1,"Noisy, Flimsy and Never Worked.","This drive never worked. It never recognized that a disk was in the drive. When I called Iomega for tech support, I had 2 different people tell me to re-install the drivers. Nothing worked. I suggest using CD-RW for backups."
1,Don't waste your money,"Installed in a minute, accesses one out of five of my old zip drives, (they all word fine on my IDE Zip Drive). The ones that it will access, the speed is so slow, you need to leave on overnight for a twenty meg download. Returned the next day."
4,Great for Training,I loved that this was just the right height for my little boy. It was a great training tool until he could reach the regular toilet and didn't need it any more. The only gripe I had about it was the receptacle bottom bin filled too quickly (boys love to push the button at the top to flush) and after a while (about 10 months) the water release from the top broke and continually dribbled water so that it wasn't ready for flushing when my son had to use it.
4,My toddler loves it!,"Adjustable height. It ""flushes""! The only drawback is that the collection tray is difficult to remove. It sticks or catches somewhere (and I can't figure out where) so when you pull hard enough to remove it, the water and pee sloshes resulting in spillage (yuck!) Except for that, I love it. My toddler loves it and it is small enough and light enough that you could take it with you for an extended trip. It's not made for travel, but if you were driving to grandma's for the weekend, it would be easy to take along. It does mount to the wall if you prefer. The stand works just fine for us."
4,great training for our boys,this was one of the best devices we ever got to help with toilet training. The boys really took to it right away and now prefer it over the sit down. The flushing mechanism is not well made and broke pretty quickly. But we still use it a lot.
3,Now makes clean-up a breeze,"I purchased this product for our 3 year old. He makes a little bit of a mess around the rim of the toilet, so I am hoping this will make clean-up a little bit easier. I purchased this with hopes to eventually mount it on the wall as he gets taller, but it turns out it doesn't come with the wall mount, its sold separately and I can't seem to find it anywhere. When using the stand, it is pretty flimsy unless you have it pushed against the wall. Other than these couple of issues, my son seems to enjoy using it and he really likes the fact that it flushes."
4,How cute is this!!! A great option for potty training boys.,"We bought this for our 18 month old son and he loves it. It works great when mounted to the wall. We found that when mounted on the stand included, it fell forward when water was in the tank. Definitely didn't want it tipping with pee in the reservoir so we mounted it. It really flushes - my son LOVES flushing it and is still working on using it. My son watches his daddy stand to use the restroom but has only pottied sitting down on the regular potty chair. I'm sure he'll eventually use it. It's a conversation starter - everyone who has seen it in our children's bathroom has commented on it."
4,Great!,"My 3 yr old son has problems with aiming, and this potty helped us a ton! He can now go all by himself, and we can practice without making a huge mess!"
3,"Good potty, but a little messy.","The potty served its purpose of teaching my son to stand up to do #1 but when you press the flush button, water splash all over the place."
3,Cute product but......,not that easy to keep clean. The drawer can get heavy if you don't get a chance to empty after each use. So don't drop it:( AND make sure you clean under the drawer inside the potty because it leaks. and yucka... NOT so much fun to clean dried urine from underneath the drawer and on the insides of the main potty. BUT the product did help potty train my son. You just have to be dilegent with the cleaning of it after each use or you will regret it later.
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I cannot express how much we LOVE this potty. We were able to potty train our son in ONE DAY with this potty. He was 2 1/2 and we had tried once before to train him on a traditional sit down child's potty and he hated it. He said it made his penis hurt to push it down so we stopped. I went online, found this potty and the day after we got it in the mail he was trained. He LOVES it and we're even taking it on vacation with us. He can go in a grown up potty, but prefers his potty. He has had 2 accidents in the past 2 weeks since training and those were only because he couldn't get to the potty quick enough. This potty is worth it's weight in GOLD."
2,This confused my son,"He didn't want to use it. He wanted to flush it like all kids would, and he tried to sit on it. He didn't get the ""you have to stand up"" concept. You know what really helped my son out? My husband showing him what to do."
2,"Great idea, but probably best for once your son is potty trained","We have tried everything to assist with potty training. The challenge with this is that when you are first teaching your son to use the potty, it is best for them to sit down to understand both pee pee and poo poo. We used this and he loves it, but he refuses to sit on the potty. We have resorted to bribes and taken Peter Potty away in order to get him to sit down. However once he understands the sensation for each pee pee and poo poo, then I'm sure we will bring this back out again. The other challenge we had is that he keeps going in and holding the water button down until it is empty and we spend a lot of time dumping the water and refilling it so that it can be in a ready status for him to go to the potty when needed."
3,Not the most stable,"If it was just a tad more stable it would be perfect, my son just turned 3 and is newly potty trained, but he just doesn't stand tall enough to use the big potty yet! So this is wonderful for toddlers who are ready for it, I had purchased it last year when my son was ready to start using a potty but he didn't quite understand the concept of standing to do the deed! But now he is like a pro! I would definitely recommend the wall attachment to make it stable, once the ""pee cup"" fills up it kept toppling over."
1,Different Brand Different Size without Explanation,I ordered the Cingular 8125 ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector. I ended up getting a Screen Guard for dopod 818... I am still expecting an explanation from the seller. Very disappointed!
4,Dvorak String Quartets (complete)/DG/Prager,"Recording includes Dvorak's complete string quartets on 9 CDs by the Prager String Quartet. The performances are excellent. The recordings are very good (SPARS code: ADD). The recording dates are 1973-1977. Good notes. Very compact packaging (stiff paper envelopes for each CD, in cardboard box -- no jewel boxes). Recommended. Amazon had the best price of the sources that I checked."
1,disservice to Dvorak,"Insensitive performances, almost unlistenable. If you love this music, as I do, you should hear the Vlach Quartet or Suk Quartet performances...the few there are. Save your money."
1,Not taking it back.,After comparing the print quality in best mode to my HP 970 CSE inkjet in best mode from the same source there is no comparison. The HP wins in print quality hands down. The CX5200 with its pigment ink is printing unsaturated colors and not sharp in best mode on my first day of use. The HP dye based ink colors are deep and the print is super sharp. I'm not taking this machine back to the dealer for a refund because the wife says the long life durabright ink is required for her scrapbooking. The software install is buggy on an XP home machine and the software is fairly worthless as well. Fortunately my MS Picture It that came with the Dell works with the scanner.
1,Hated it,I had problems with the colors... I don't have time or ink to waste teetering with the 3-colors to get a natural pic.Plus my computer froze when I used it...
1,Will not buy Epson again,"This printer worked great until I replaced the ink cartridges. then it would not print at all. Epson sent me a new printer. It also worked great until I changed the ink cartridges. Now it is out of warranty and they won't even talk to you unless you pay a 9.95 fee. After seeing all the other reviews with the same problem, I know it is not anything that I'm doing. Epson should recall this printer."
1,Bringing down the average,"I noticed that there are 31/2 stars for this printer. That's way too much in my opinon. This printer is an absolute disaster. It barely prints at all, even after using Epson cartridges, cleaning the heads, and generally performing all the troubleshooting procedures, it still won't print. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER."
1,I'm with Frank Ferris!,"I agree, Frank, these CX5200's are designed to fail in 1 year. On November 28, 2003, my first one failed -- nothing but black marks here and there. Called Epson and they sent a replacement. Installed the replacement on December 5, 2003. Here it is November 27, 2004 (almost a year to the day) and the ""replacement"" just did the same thing! That's it for me & Epson."
1,MINE SUCKS TOO! NEVER AGAIN! EPSON OWES ME A REFUND!,I've had the same problem as everyone else. It was fine until it ran out of Ink the first time. Now it won't print at all.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,This is a piece of JUNK,"I got this because I thought it would be exactly what I needed. It worked wonderfully--for six months. Now it prints only in blue (if you want full color) or black. Banding and splotching are everywhere, and I can't clean the heads because they are permanent. What a piece of junk. Never will I buy an Epson again."
1,Won't Work with XP,"This may be a good product, but the software for scanning will not work with Windows XP Professional. Particularly frustrating was that Epson passed the buck to their software developer. I was asked to install patches from Microsoft, Epson and follow 5 pages of confusing instructions from New Soft Inc., the developer, and it still didn't work. Email contact with Epson was slow and mainly trivial. I found the whole business not worthy of a company with the reputaion (lt least the reputation they want to project) of Epson."
2,clogged for good,"This one is a replacement of the first cx5200 which went kaput after about 6 mo. It now will not print the colors despite new ink cartridges.There is a guey black mess inside,suggesting the black cartridge leaked. I've tried to clean this up with q-tips and alcohol without effect. Even the black doesn't print properly,this after multiple head cleaning proceedures.I admit that the printer wasn't used much this summer,particularly the past 3-4 weeks,so this goes along with other people's experience. Generally, the cx5200 works well when it's working, but it's too high maintenance and unreliable. I would not buy another,possibly not another Epson"
5,WOW!,"In short just what most people need for the home office. It serve as a printer, copier, scanner, and with a liter trick you can also fax using your computer!Pros:1. Friendly command panel2. Intuitive menus3. Good looking!4. A+ design5. I am sure it fits your budget!Cons:1. Can't think of any!In summary, I will buy it again if I would have to!"
4,"If user has XP Professional, will the scanner work?","Hello! A poster with XP Professional said he could NOT scan with this Epson. (See the post dated September 8, 2003). The poster indicated that the scanning software that came with the Epson Stylus was not compatible with XP Professional. Has anyone else out there with XP Professional (not XP Home) had problems scanning with this device? Thanks!"
1,Software is not ready for XP prime time.,"Executive summary: Owing this scanner/printer is a lot more convenient than going to the Kodak photo copy machine at the drugstore and probably cheaper in the long run.I followed the software install instructions perfectly for an XP home edition. The install program, for whatever reason, installed the CX5200 as two identical printers on my XP machine. These caused 12 install warnings. After deleting one of the duplicate printers the Epson software started working better. I deleted the software and reran the install. Same errors but no double printer setup. The scanner/printer feeds paper from the back which may be a problem for some users. The machine makes a very loud clunk when it grabs a sheet of paper. The print quality was slightly duller than the original scanned photo in default mode. (see other review that I have posted here)"
4,Anyone had success using non-Epson ink with CX5200?,"Hi! Has ANYONE had success using non-Epson replacement ink cartridges or ink refill kits with the CX5200? On this model, the printhead is attached to the printer rather than the (replaceable) ink cartridge, which makes it much more prone to clogging and damage if one uses non-Epson ink. Still, I am willing to take the chance on non-Epson ink if someone out there has had a positive experience with a particular company?"
1,Forget about scanning multiple pages,Want to scan a multipage document and saveit as a multipage tif? Forget about it - it doesnt do it. Want to scan a single page black and white document and save it as a tif? 9 megs!
2,Good while it lasted - only 14 months!,"This printer is great for the first couple cartridge replacements. However, I just had to replace all my cartridges at the same time, and wouldn't you know it, when I go to print I get nothing on the paper. NOTHING! I have cleaned the printheads about 15 times, to no avail. Epson's solution is to clean the heads up to 10 times. Yeah, whatever. Their product is built perfectly to last just beyond the 1 year warranty and then plop! If you want a printer that lasts more than a year, look elsewhere. Otherwise, don't say I, and many other disgruntled reviewers here, didn't warn 'ya!"
1,Don't Waste your money,"I guess I was luckier than a lot of the other people here because I actually got to use mine for two years (since August 2003). But like everyone else, I too, ended spending over $50 on new print catridges only to have it fail on me too. Doesn't print anything, goes through the motions, makes all the sounds, but in the end, NOTHING. I thought of fixing it, but then they told me it's $35 to just ""look"" at it and then another $89.00 per hour PLUS more money for parts.I just went out and bought myself an HP printer, with 3 years warranty...just in case."
2,"Nice features, lasted only 13 months!","I purchased this printer in February of 2003. It is a good printer with many useful features, however the print quality started going down and it quit printing cyan. After replacing the cyan cartridge, and doing many cleanings and test prints with no results, I called their tech support. Epson tech support was great and they agreed that my problem is a printhead filure, however where it is just out of waranty they would not replace or repair the machine. I feel that a printer should last more than just over a year, especially since it was not used a great deal, and the failure was due to a product defect. I wish that Epson stood behind their products."
1,It does NOT work after replacing the cartridges,"I liked the printer for first couple of monthw. I guess everybody does that. That's why you see all five or four stars. It is great at the beginning.Once you have replaced the cartridges, you are in trouble. I have used it for 8 months without any problem. I have replaced the cartridges than. It started giving me problem. I had to run head cleaning many times. There was lots of leaking, and missing characters. Then suddenly, it stopped using ""cyan"" after that yellos has gone.I hope technical support agrees with me and changes the printer.Basically, once you replace the cartridges, you are screwed!!!Be careful!"
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE MAC OS X,It is not possible to connect this printer to MAC OS 10.2.6 The computer will not recognize the printer even if you download the necessary driver from Epson(TWAIN 5.25A).
1,heads clogged after 3 changes,"absolute bollocks. bought it when it first camme on the market, used it rarely, 3rd cartridge change in 2 years, not printing at all despite severe head-cleaning session."
1,Piece of garbage,"I am so disgusted w/this printer. I rarely print, but most of the time I have, I've had problems. I've wasted a lot of money on ink, bcz I thought the ink dried out. It's VERY noisy. Takes a long time to process the information before it prints. (The actual printing is quick; but it takes forever before it starts printing.) I can't tell you how disgusted I am w/this printer. I just found many complaints online about it. Don't waste your money. It's a piece of you know what."
4,Scanning with XP Pro,"My brother has this printer and XP Pro at school and he said that he has had no problems scanning. He has a Dell, and they sold the printer on their website, so the previous poster might have had an unique situation."
4,Still a winner,"This is the third Epson Printer/product I've owned since 1993 - LOVE IT - the trueness of the colors, the separate ink cartridges is a great improvement, and the scanner is fast and easy to use - the resolution is all I could ask - it handles my 100+ year-old photos well.If and ADF attachment were available for it - I'd think it perfect!"
2,Printer died after 26 months.....,"I purchased this printer just 26 months ago and now have to replace the unit. It started going bad a few months ago when the unit refused to scan items correctly. Not long after that the print quality started to suffer and now the only color to work correctly is cyan. I have only ever used Epson cartridges and routinely clean and align the head, so what gives? At this point I have no more patience with this unit so out it goes."
1,So disappointing!!!,"I bought this in May of 2004 and it barely lasted 7 months. I too am having the same problem everyone else has mentioned. It was a beautiful piece of equipment until I changed the ink cartridges, now it's just a piece of junk! I only wish I had read the reviews before I went out and bought $60 worth of ink cartridges and installed them!!! That $60 could've went towards a new printer, definitely not an Epson!"
1,Stay away from this printer,This is the second epson printer that I've owned that failed shortly after the warranty expired. I changed the ink cartridges and now it won't print at all. A big waste of money!
1,Did not live up to expectations,"I purchased the Epson CX5200 All in One printer/scanner/copier about 2 years ago when I bought my Gateway computer. I recently purchased new print cartridges and installed them. Nothing happened - tried all the things Epson said to do - head alignment, nozzle cleaning, etc. Because my printer was no longer in warranty, they directed me to a local printer repair shop authorized to repair Epson printers.The repair shop told me that I would need to purchase a new print head at a cost of about $230 (you can buy a new printer for about $130!). I had just spent almost $75 on print cartridges - you know how expensive they are - plus $42 for the authorized deal to just look at my printer.I am appalled that this printer lasted less than two years. It got normal use - for school reports and printing photos. My old HP lasted for years. I would definitely not repurchase an Epson printer any time soon."
5,Excellent features and performance at a reasonable price,"I've had this printer for about 3 weeks and am extremely pleased. I've used it for text printing, copying, scanning and, more recently, photo printing. The performance has been terrific - I printed out an 8x10 photo that looks comparable to one produced by a portrait studio. For photo printing, it is critical to take the picture at high resolution, and to ensure that the printer is set to the proper settings (e.g. the ""best photo"" setting, photo paper setting, and several others.). While I've read reviews on other sites that complain about photo quality printing on this model, I think that following these guidelines and using good photo quality paper ensures good quality printing. Also, the printer does not seem to drink up ink cartidges the way others are reputed to, and has the convenience (and economy) of allowing you to replace separate color ink cartridges."
4,Epson CX5200 for PC & Mac...A True Friend to Both..Read Me!,"As a PC & Mac User, I haved used the Epson CX5200 for 6 months now and here's the info every ready needs to know about this printer....1. Ease of Setup and Use. Just follow the instruction (yes fellow men, that means follow them to the tee!) and you'll be up in no time.2. Print Quality. 9 out of 10. Good printing for Photo's but get the photo paper if you want to take advantage of the great pictures for home or friends.3. Copy / Scan / Print & Fax (yes, you can fax). Copying a document is too easy as well as scanning. Faxing, is just as easy. If you have an internal modem (pc or mac), then you too can fax. Just push the scan button on the CX5200 and the software automatically takes you through the rest.Overall, you can network this printer as well and this out performs most of the HP series (PSC 2100 2200 7150 7350 7550). Avoid the CX3200 and get this one...5280 x 1440 print quality, who can go wrong."
4,good keyboard with built in usb ports,"Its a good keyboard with built in usb ports. The only issue I had was unrelated to the keyboard itself. Microsoft stiffed me on the rebate, by constantly saying that I lack this or that. After a bit of mail tag, I gave up on the rebate. For a huge multi-billion dollar company, Microsoft is quite cheap with their rebates! So one star lost for their crappy customer service"
2,Agree with the previous review - mouse is better!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. If you need just the optical mouse, then buy the mouse alone. The keyboard pro has the following problems: 1) It is bulky and its odd shape at the bottom prevents you from using the normal keyboard gel pads. (you cannot remove the odd protrusion from the keyboard - it is built in!) 2) The USB ports are meaningless as it is not self-powered and the separation of the keyboard cable pins and the USB pins (where you attach to the computer) are too short to be useful. 3) The speed buttons don't really work unless you run a keyboard program all the time! (and could be a cause for privacy problems) Not even the volume buttons work! 4)The keyboard does not have power off, suspend etc. Overall the keyboard is very bad, the mouse is good (a little bit bulky for most hands though - make sure you try it out at your local store before you buy it!)"
5,Champion,"I hadn't had a chance to see this film in years, and obtaining my own copy brought back memories of a then relatively new actor named Kirk Douglas. His performance made him a star. Paul Stewart, in a supporting role as his fight manager, was first-rate in the part. Arthur Kennedy did a fine job too, as the hero's crippled brother. Ruth Roman was also good as the abandoned wife.Douglas often played roles of a mean, yet likable cuss, and this ranks among his best at that genre."
4,Happiness in a Storm: Facing Illness & Embracing Life as a Healthy Survivor,"Written by a physician, herself a healthy cancer survivor, it is both informatonal & inspiring. I read it myself, then passed it along to a new friend who's in the same boat.It's not easy to live with a devastating illness & even harder when it returns, time & time again. It's a never-ending battle that can knock you down but, with luck, good medical care, & the right attitude, you can turn your battle in to a positive experience.A 'Healthy Survivor' is not just someone who has battled, or is battling a life-threatening diesease, it's a person who continues to enjoy life while doing that. It's a good goal."
2,not so great,"this book is heavy, dry, pedantic, and repetitive. it contains common sense, but i couldn't force myself to finish. the author seems nice, but she underestimates her audience. i bought it to share with a cancer-patient friend and cousin. after trying to read it, i wouldn't want to burden them with it."
4,"so far, it's a good cheaper lcd monitor","This is one of the cheaper lcds on the market. I compared the image quality with some of the more expensive brands, and there was little to no difference in sharpness, color or contrast, if you play with the controls. The lcd is extremely bright (maybe even a little too much, it's adjustable) Some down points: no side-to-side swivel, only 1 year warranty (most competitor's are 3 yrs). Per another reviewer, if you run the monitor at any resolution other than the native, pictures and especially text letters may appear a bit fuzzy. I think that this behavor is consistent with other lcd monitors."
1,never received,Can't tell you how good it is because the seller never sent it to me? Guess I wont shop through Fatherdragon again.....
4,Always a good product,I've been using CRC products for many many years both in auto and marine applictions. i rarely use any other product. I always used 6-66 for years around the boat but when they switched over I contacted the company and found out that the same anti-corrosion protection was in 6-56 as well.
3,No way to contact manufacturer,"I could not get this product to work; however, I am unsure if it is a problem with my computer or the product. The negative part, though, is the Web site listed does not exist and there's no phone # to call. My computer company told me to contact the manufacturer, and I was not able to do that. A bit frustrating."
1,Waste Of Money,I purchased this book to learn how to use Direct3D. The book does a good job of explaining 3D concepts. Upon reading the first few chapters on 3D I thought that I could get at least a triangle to rotate on the screen. Unfortunatly none of the source code works. He must have left a few important parts out in the initiation of direct3D because all of his sample programs crash. The Author would not even respond to my emails about this problem! I was unable to learn how to program with direct3D with this book ...BR>Do Not Buy This Book!
1,"I agree, it is LAME","Now and then author gets stuck with things he does not understand, skips the most challenging topics, and dares to conclude ""pretty simple, huh! So do not get afraid"". Dear, nobody is afraid! Just give us your (amount)expertize on how to manage different coordinate systems, how to play with different surface formats and how -- exactly -- set the scene the way I want it. Pretty simple, DUH!"
3,Adequate but Careless,"I am now half way through this book and find it ok in some ways and not ok in other ways.The CD does not correlate at all well with the examples in the book. This is a serious flaw, imho.I judge most of the text in the book itself to be adequately written. It could have been better.The book does seem to cover the important issues, however, so it does have value.One can learn from this book."
1,Skip This One,I've purchased almost every game programming book on Amazon and it seems most of them are the same. Either so simple that you can't do anything with them or too much information that it's hard to keep up with it. I did find a book that did a good job with things but don't remember the name. I do remember that the author's last name is Crooks (not making it up).This book is just too much money for the information provided.
1,BAD,"Don't get this book, even if you are a beginner. I bought it and was really dissapointed when I found the examples to run at 30-40 fps ( GeForce 3 Ti200 ) with simple 2D blitting. He makes horrible use of any hardware rendering.. His excuse is he is not familiar with D3D v 8.0 and his work arounds are a disaster that will only start someone new off on the wrong track. I recommend the Role Playing book, it has exactly the same chapters on Windows programming, the sample code runs perfectly, and the humor is bearable!"
5,A beginner opinion,I have several books about DirectX. This is the only one that I have realized to use all the times.
1,Crash and Burn Your Machine -- how? Execute an example,"I find the book frustrating since many (read most) of the examples ""hang"" my machine. I am up to Chapter 8 and expect things to improve -- but no. I was able to figure out in the beginning windows program how to delay things a bit in order to give me enough time to terminate the program. I think the author is a little ahead of himself, introducing a game loop that is ideal structure when acutally building a game but a disaster when just trying to run his samples to render points on the screen (Don't run that one!). Why do publishers allow authors to show code to demostrate points that will crash and burn machines. Why doesn't the author just state -- don't run this code yet! I think by Chapter 8 things should start to work - don't you? I agree with another reviewer -- don't waste your money, time and machine cycles on this one until the author cleans up the examples."
2,Too many errors but a few gems,"I have mixed feelings about this book. While the author does a good job at explaining the details of the DirectX 8 calls, his examples are full of bugs (check p. 580 for one of many). None of his examples in the 3D section of the book work in full screen mode. I had to change the code to windowed mode in order to view them. Some of the files on the CD are also corrupt and the web site only has a few fixes.I'm giving this book an extra star because one thing I really liked was the console mode example. And, on the whole, I liked the author's clear explanations of the nuances of DirectX.I think the publishers clearly rushed this book to press, and it's too bad because this book could have been great had a little more time been taken to clean up the examples."
3,Creative but inconsistent,"Quite a bit of ""Break it Down"" is amazingly good. Amazingly good because most of the stories are brief, to the point and blatant with a slight quirk to them. Not all the stories in ""Break it Down"" are remarkable, however, and Davis seems to get swallowed in her repetitive cycle of a confused, quietly angry woman. 3/5 (Buy ""Almost No Memory,"" its far better)"
3,Not very well written,"I bought this for Valentine's Day for our daughter, whose name is Lily. This is not a well-written children's book. It is the sort that makes you wonder how it got published, as it looks like just anyone could have written it. There's no charm about it."
4,Genesis and the BIG Bang,I think the book is well done but it could cause difficulty reading due to the level of material includedfor someone who does not have a back ground in science and the Bible . In all I am glad it was published andit settles questions many of us have never had an answer that we could agree with.DWR
3,UGH!,"I found this book to be extremely difficult to understand. I stayed with it as long as I could hoping that I would reach a point where it would begin to make sense but a quarter of the way through I had to surrender to defeat and move it to archives in my kindle. Very disapointing as many reviews made it seem to be one of the more easy to understand books on this topic, no so for Me !!"
3,I think this book is okay.,Truth is a Bright Star is about a Hopi boy who is kidnapped by Spanish soldiers. He is sold to a man whose life work is killing beavers. Once the boy meets him his life is changed forever and so is the trapper's. This book is good and bad. I don't really like Native American books. I liked it because it was full of action. I would recommend this book to fourth and fifth graders.
2,"Transmits well, but is a hazard while driving","This product worked well - that is it got the music from my ipod into my car's stereo. The unit, however, didn't fit my car well. I had to use both the cigarette lighter arm and the extension arm to get it to fit. Once I put my ipod into the cradle it became quite top heavy. Every time I would go around a corner it would tilt over. I would find myself doing the mom arm protection move for my ipod. Not good. I would only recommend this product if it fits your car using the single arm that fits in the cigarette lighter."
1,bad idem,I was very unhappy with the quality of this product and that I have not yet received a refund for my return that I mailed over a week ago.
2,Not worth the money,"I had the older version of this transpod, which recieved transmission really well. It died after approx. 2 years or so (as like nearly all electronics do), so after being happy with the old one, i bought this model.Herein started the problem. I don't know why, but this model recieves a terribly poor signal. As well as that, it puts out an annoying noise when accessories in the car are switched on, ie. headlights, AC, cell phone chargers etc.Hopefully there will be a better product released, and more similar to the previous model which worked excellently."
1,"fast too charge, slow to credit",I refused the delivery of this shipment on 12/28 at the suggest of Amazon since they didn't have it in stock for timely delivery and refused to change the shipping address. I still have not received my credit for the item plus shipping charges....
1,Terribly disappointed,"I was so excited to have a way to listen to my ipod songs in my car when I initially purchased this. At this point I'm very disappointed in the quality - some songs play clearly, but the volume maxes out, not my car speakers. Other songs don't play clearly at all -they sound like they are playing through a radio station with significant static...it doesnt matter if the songs were ripped from a CD, purchased on itunes or downloaded...I don't understand. I have had the item too long now to return it, but if I had just purchased it, I would be going straight back to the store for a refund. For $90, it should provide much better quality! Learn from my mistake, save your money!!"
2,What am I missing?,"I bought the DLO to replace a broken Macally FM transmitter that was working intermittently. I ended up returning it and just trying my best with the Macally becauase the DLO has such poor broadcasting strength. I was surprised because the DLO has such great recommendations. Overall, I like the design but could not tolerate the constant static in the background. I won't exclude the possibility that it's just my car however, since very few other people seem to have had this problem."
1,Not as Good as the Old One,"I had an older version of this DLO Tranpod Transmitter which worked great. Great reception and sound. It even transmitted to 87.9, my preferred empty station. When the old one broke (I had it about 2 years) I wanted the same one, since I really liked the cradle and it worked so well.BUT the new one IS TERRIBLE! Apparently it's another generation, or something, but it doesn't tune to the station that I want, and more importantly, the sound quality is extremly distorted...when it transmits at all. BEWARE! Don't buy this item! I will be returning mine."
4,Good gadget,"Although the arm could be improved upon, this is a good transmitter. Compared to the Griffin iTrip we already owned, the reception / transmission of the DLO Transpod is much greater. We would definitely purchase it again."
1,Keep researching...this DLO is a stinker!,"Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last."
2,Weak FM transmitter,"I had a last generation DLO FM transmitter which I bought for $30. It worked great but the lighter plug thing lost some bolts and the wires got torn out so I threw it away.I was suprised to find the current generation costing $70. I bought this one and the transmitter is very weak. Even on dead-air stations, passing your hand next to the unit will cause it to fade out. At best it sounds like a FM station 100+ miles away.Overall ergonomics of this unit are good. Its a good fiit in my truck and came with a few 'arm' options. I was mad enough to buy a competitor model to try and it had the same problem. I am guessing the FCC cracked down on them or something. Device does have a 'line-out' so I'lll be buying a casette adapter soon."
3,"A ""nice"" performance.","Pristine sound and immaculate playing, but that doesn't make for a great Mahler 2. Compared with, say, Bernstein (Sony), Solti (1981) or Gielen (Hannsler) the performance is under characterized and sterile, especially in the first 3 movements. They lack drive, and the bubbly, chamber-like playing style often sounds out of place. Things improve in Movements IV and V, but the earlier weakness ruins the transformational experience. The perspective of the recording is also more distant than usual. I really like the previous SFS releases of Nos. 3 and 6 (and No. 1 is quite good), but I'd have to conclude that this is something of a superficial dud."
5,OH MY GOD!,"I haven't written a review on this site in a really long time. But there are just some things that require coming out of exile.The performance and recording of the massive work are massive, phenomenal. I have LOTS of recordings of this piece, and I've listened to each and every one of them LOTS and LOTS. Mahler is a God to me. He (and Bruckner) got me through my teenage-years... This performance is special. There is so much power, SO much beauty, SO much intensity, SO much care taken... I've never heard such ferocity (and irony, and agony, and ecstacy) in the first movement, such delicacy (and verve) in the second and third movements, and as for the last movement -- hot damn, son of a gun -- the things Michael Tilson Thomas does with it are just spectacular.This is my favorite, my absolute favorite. Please give it repeated listenings. There are so many rewards in store for you."
3,expected Wow but not,"having heard MTT elsewhere, read glowing reviews and knowing what SACD can sound like, i was generally disappointed both in music and sonics.music just was not memorable and the poor sonics did not help any.it was either too soft or too loud with not much in between.yes, this is an admittedly shallow but a layman's view of an expensive cd."
5,Best $23.00 I've spent this year.,"The best story in this collection is ""All through the House"", a cinematic ride backward through time that explores the destruction of a house, and then of a family, all under the most tragic circumstances possible. It's the kind of story, if it were written by a lesser talent, that would tilt toward nihilism, toward death as spectacle, mass murder as entertaining diversion. Coake, though, works a special kind of magic, the kind that piles on the trouble, and then, without resorting to anything treacly or sentimental, leaves the reader with the feeling that, yes, bad things will happen, terrible, terrible things, but we will survive, we will go on, we will love and continue to love, and even those who have inflicted the worst pain will have also lived beautifully in moments, that no one is beyond pain, and that, while there might be no final redemption, there will be tomorrow."
3,catchy cut,"Khia came along with one of those catchy fun summer time cuts&she also was Stacked which was good for my eyesight. ain't not much beyond being a One Hit wonder or a summer time wonder,but still worth boping your head to.the Mixes are cool as well."
1,Trashy music-terrible,"This track is the tackiest, most vulgar thing I have ever heard. She should be ashamed of herself for having produced it. An embarrassment to women everywhere."
4,Great Sea Kayak Touring instruction book,Very informative and easy to read instruction book. Fully loaded with tips and nice pictures too. I found several new ideas and detailes here for my next kayak touring plans! I really recommend this book for every seriouse seakayak padler.
5,A MUST SEE,"THE DOCUMENTARY WAS VERY GOOD. IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED. WISH IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER. BUT, ALL IN ALL IT IS GREAT FOR LEARNING ABOUT WASHINGTON D.C. AND THEIR GHOSTS."
3,Spanish Blood,I wish the author had developed a deeper plot line rather than just scratching the surface of what could have been an outstanding effort.
5,easy to install,this was easy to install and fixed the problem with my garage door disconnecting from the track
1,Anyone want white spaces and extra margins?,"Who are these people giving 5 stars??Clearly this book is short on material. It seems like the author tried to cover up that fact by putting extra wide margins shortening the pages. Also, there were typos all over the place. Not so good especially when regexp characters are concerned.Here's a book that seems like a major rush job lacking in annotations and illustrations, yet plenty of white spaces and margins."
3,"Adequately lukewarm, definitely not taming","I agree with the reviewer who said the book never soars beyond the basics. And, aside from typos, I can't stand factual errors or bad advice such as using the more expensive alternation (i|I)ce instead of the more efficient character class [iI]ce in some examples. It is good that the author suggests the nio FileChannel for working with regex matching in file content--a correct, and current, approach. Overall, the beginning chapters are too wordy, the examples too simple and nuances not explained at all or well. It is only an adequate treatment, and far removed from the classic ""Mastering Regular Expressions"" by Friedl."
4,Good old-fashioned Night Ranger!,"As someone who made it through high school in the 1980's with a lot of help from bands like Night Ranger, The Scorpions, Styx, and AC/DC, I can say that ""New York Time"" is more good rockin' head-banging fun music. I don't listen to the lyrics of any song, so I don't care about ""the message"" or any of that crap. I just know that this is a good ""crank up the volume, windows down"" kind of song for people who like guitar and harmony and a real drum set - without any screaming and screeching."
5,Cuts to the core,"The audiotape was a rare experience: the author's words and voice just cutting immediately to the core. Her thoughts, guidance and examples had a strong ring of truth. The tape seems enormously sincere and I have found it helpful and healing each time I heard it. A tape to play more than once.The examples from Buddhism and the guidance through meditative practices are very helpful and well chose, but the gentle urging in words to accept ones self was most powerful.Tim SiegelFriends Wilderness Retreat Centerwww.friendswilderness.org"
5,Radical Self Acceptance,"This book is brilliantly written by a therapist with great depth and kindness. As a Buddhist for over 20 years I applaud her presentation of Buddhist beliefs and as a person training to be a psychotherapist, she has given me lofty goals. My meditation practice will be far stronger.Thank you Tara for sharing so much of your heart....wonderful job.Danny O'Neill"
4,Excellent Intro to Mindfulness with a Heart,"These tapes give true inspiration to putting the ageless wisdom of mindfulness to work in one's life. For anyone who longs to be free of suffering, a heart-felt and compassionate way to begin, or gain inspiration to continue. My only quibble is Teacher Tara Brach speaks in a monotone at some points-doubtless this would be soothing as a dharma talk in the meditation hall, but is a bit off putting when listening to at home."
5,EXCELLENT resource for the Jagdpanther,I bought this book to aid in my scratch-build of a Jagdpanther in 1:6 scale and am more than pleased with all the valuable information it contains... The scale drawings and photos (more than enough of both) have been just what I needed... The writing and history of the vehicle is detailed and extensive as well... The best book on the subject out of more than 5 I have gathered for reference... I could have stopped with this one instead of spending the cash on the others had I known...
4,A must for fans,"Soft Like Me is not one of my favorite songs by St E. In fact, I would dare to say it grates on my nerves, due entirely to the rap section. The B-side is interesting enough, but mostly as a must-have for the obsessive St E fan. The big bonus on this disc is the last remix, which removes all traces of Wildflower's annoying rap. We are left with an upbeat remix with nothing but Sarah's sweet vocals and that chorus you can't get out of your brain."
3,DECENT BALEARIC CHILLOUT....,"THE ONLY THING WORKING FOR ME HERE IS THE SECOND TRACK, ""ABBY I HARDLY KNEW YOU""...THIS IS A NICE PIECE OF EARLY MORNING CAFE CHILLOUT...PERFECT FOR MIDDAY BAR SETS OR LOUNGE SETTINGS..."
4,Worked well,"It worked properly,since installed and has been working ever since.worked as they indicated it would .and does the job"
1,WARNING: **** NO SERVICE FOR THIS PRODUCT ****,"I had this product for over 2 years now an had nothing but problems with it.All ZOOM products are riddled with problems and support is non existent. If you are considering this for VOIP - think again... The bundled Global Village service is horrible..and recently it looks like they are having internal problems as well if not out of business - their site is up, but you cannot get any support."
3,I found it lacking,"I like what a reviewer below said, that this book is written with a you are holier than thou attitude. It's very accurate. My problem with the book is that there was little substance to it. Everyone was so excited about the Dahli Lama (sp?) speaking on Christianity that they missed the fact that he taught little in his speaking. And there was so much extraneous commentary that I found it distracting. I'd like to see his Holiness do a serious book on Buddhism and Christianity since I see that the two have much in common. I'm sure Christ achieved Buddhahood."
4,A New Perspective on Christianity,"When I discovered that a book existed on this topic, I was skeptical as to the book's value. Although this book is short in length with less than 200 pages, it is full of wisdom.His Holiness the Dalai Lama is given various passages from each of the four Gospels and is asked to evaluate them. His Holiness only evaluates the meaning of the passages while avoiding criticizing Christianity. Because he believes there is no right answer, the Dalai Lama the value in having multiple religious faiths over one dominant religion. His Holiness give a new and valuable perspective to important passages of the Gospels. Christians seeking new meaning for their faith will find value in these evaluations. Similarly, Buddhists will be enlightened by the Dalai Lama's thoughts on the life of Jesus Christ. As a whole, this is a valuable read for all."
1,"One-sided ""perspectives""","Silly me. I thought perspectives meant more than one view. This book, while claiming to be an indifferent look at the New Age Movement, obviously is written by staunch backers of the Movement with too few exceptions to be considered balanced. People shouldn't pretend to be scholarly when they're simply being cheerleaders for an idea."
4,Uplifting & Inspirational,"I have used this lovely CD primarily as background music for reflection and meditation with small groups. Many have commented on its ability to relax, focus, and transport. It's a winner!"
3,a late case for the prosecution,"Van Der Vat presents a credible brief against Albert Speer and his (ignorance but remorse) defense at Nüremberg 1945-46. Did Speer know about régime crimes? Probably. Was Speer guilty? Probably. DId he deserve the death penalty? Probably. Those are questions raised by this work.Speer was convicted, served 20 years, and was released in 1966. During imprisonment he wrote his memoir, published it as `Inside the Third Reich' in 1970, and became a best-selling celebrity -who subsequently published more books and made public appearances.Though as much a polemic as a history, this is an interesting work. The author was unfortunate in subject access and timing: two years earlier (1995) Gitta Sereny published ""Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth"" and confessed Speer as surely as anyone could.Nonetheless, to those interested in Speer, this is still well worth reading (Sereny and Joachim Fest's 2001 `Speer: The Final Verdict' merit more attention)."
2,"Hopelessly biased, ill focus, poor construction","With the amount of Speer texts in existence, van der vat's biography certainly falls into the bottom quarter in terms of quality and relevance.As an attempt to set the record straight, with regards to Speer, van der vat falls hopelessly short by focusing on Speer's motives, rather than the historical facts at hand. Most of this book is conjecture, trying to connect Speer to some larger Nazi conspiracy, refusing to acknowledge that Speer could have simply been an administrator, who was isolated from the larger picture of the ""Jewish question"" and war crimes.Finally, the book's citations and bibliography leave something to be desired. For instance, the index does not contain an entry for ""slave labor,"" which was one of Speer's greatest transgressions as Armament's Minister.Recommended, Inside the Third Reich, Speer: The Final Verdict, and Interrogations: The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands."
2,Strong plastic/rubber odor,"The football just lays there with treats in it. Our dog LOVES balls and the gizmos that dispense treats, but this has such a strong plastic/rubber smell to it that it overpowers the smell of dog treats. I can see it across the room right now, and the slots are filled with treats. Between our two big dogs, those yummies should have been long gone!"
3,Not that great,"FOOT BALL WAS VERY HARD RUBBER, but my black Lab had pieces off instantly. Would not recomend it for agressive chewers."
3,Small Premier Football--OK not great,This football is OK for my puppy but I hate to give him two bisquits at a time so I just give him the football to chew.It's OK but premier makes many other better dog toys!!Shop around...
5,Dog Toy,Purchased for a overactive border collie who is now thinking of trying out for a pro football team
3,I was hoping for better...,"I purchased this toy after reading all the positive reviews. My 9 month old pitbull started chewing pieces off of her black kong and I needed something even stronger. Unfortunately, this football isn't it. She was able to chew off little pieces the first day I gave it to her. I am glad that only small pieces come off, but two weeks later, she has chewed through to where the treats are held in place. She does choose to chew on this over her new kong, so she definitely likes it. If your dog can take pieces out of the black kong, this toy isn't going to hold up either. If your dog can't get through the kong, I would definitely try this."
5,Great For Power Chewers,"My Border Collie mix has chewed up two red Kongs, so it's difficult for me to find her a toy that she likes but can't destroy. This fits the bill perfectly on both counts. It's durable and she's always carrying it around with her -- I've taken to calling her Peyton Manning!The only thing to be careful with is that it's very heavy -- a smaller dog might have trouble carrying it around (she's about 50 lbs.)."
5,My dog sharpens his teeth!,"My over-sized Pomeranian, Tiger Kowalski, once gnawed a perfect, 4"" hole in the middle of a flat wall in my house. He has demolished every kind of chew toy except those made out of the kind of rubber used in this ball (like that used in Kong products). He's now had this toy for over a year and has just finally managed to chew off a tiny piece of one of the pointy ends.I used to stuff this ball with ordinary, small-sized Milk Bones, but ol' Tiger has been getting a bit chubby lately, so I don't do that very often any more. However, lack of a treat has not dampened his enthusiasm for his football in the least. He gnaws on it with impunity and will chase it for as long as anyone has ever been willing to throw it. It's without a doubt his very favorite toy-- and he is a spoiled little beast with too many toys. He loves it so much that I just bought him a spare for when he finally kills off the current one!"
4,I Dug 'The Dig',"Another fantastic LucasArts adventure game. If your reading this you probably collect them too, and this one is a classy game. This game is getting really rare so grab it up at this low price (look up ""Day of the Tentacle"" or ""Sam & Max Hit the Road"", they are still about $30!) Unlike the Monkey Island games, there is little funny about The Dig, it handles itself in a mysterious, deadly serious manner - but it is still awesome. It just doesn't have much replay value for me personally because of the lack of humor though. That is also the only reason I won't give it 5 stars overall."
2,Poor Signal Strength but You Get What You Pay For,"I use this card with the SMC router, which produces between 40% and 60% signal strength from 10 ft. away through one wall. Cupping your hand over the antenna will further diminish the signal strength to 25%. I would have to say that thest figures are poor considering the range is claimed at 150ft. I have heard that some channels work better than others, though I haven't experimented yet. Additionally, be prepared to wait for an hour to get tech support. Tech support is hit or miss. One person was really great while another got me off the phone as quickly as possible and was of no help. Too bad everyone can't be IBM. I wish IBM made these kind of products, they may not have bulletproof products but they have AWESOME tech support."
1,Did not work for me,"The card installed faultlessly, an improvement over other hardware I have tried to install. Unfortunately, it never connected with the Lynksys access point either at home or at work. I called technical support and they suggested I upgrade my BIOS. I did so, but it still did not work. I tried calling the 800 technical support number again and was directed to call a 900 number with a message that you need to be 18 to call. I was a little nervous about calling such a number from work, so I sent email. After about a week I got a reply to make sure that the linksys was set to long preable. It was, but the card still did not work. I am returning the card."
1,Doesn't Work with Windows 2000 Professional,"Bought this card and could not get to install on Windows 2000. Called tech support and they emailed me an updated driver but it did not correct the problem. The computer recognizes the card but there is the dreaded yellow exclamation point by the device with a Code 31 error. After spending a few hours, I threw in the towel. I think I'll try a DLink or Orinoco."
3,Poor Range,"My SMC7004AWBR/SMC2632W combo does not provide adequate coverage of my 1100 sq ft apartment, which is somewhat disapointing. Testing at the office shows the Lucent cards to have much better range than the SMC card"
1,Worst electronics ever,I bought this one in January 2002 along with a SMC Barricade. Since then I had to reinstall the drivers maybe 200 times.Very poor range. You can do what this does with 5 meters of cable. Because after that range you lose the connection and the drivers require to be loaded again.I sent 3 e-mails to the technical service. No reply. If you have 3 hours you can call them because that is the time that you have to wait to talk to someone.With XP it is even a worst experience. Don't even want to talk about it...Stay away from this one. Actually stay away from SMC.
1,"Didn't ever work, terrible tech support","I could not get the (unsigned) driver to install on Windows 2000. I called tech support, which sent me to a call center in India. They said that they would email the correct driver and never did. I have downloaded the driver from the web site, and that doesn't install either. Unfortunately, I bought it at Microcenter, and I don't know if I can return it."
4,limited range,"The card and software took 15 min to set up and working, very easy. Once it is connected, the connection is rock solid. The data rate for surfing the web via a DSL connection is more than enough. My SMC AP is in the back of the house and I am having trouble connecting to it in the front of the house on the same floor, a little more than 50 ft away. I'd have rated it a 5-star if it could work at around 70 ft."
5,Very Pleased....,"Just received and installed my 2632W PC Card. I installed it on a Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop running WINXP Home. I am using it with a SMC7004AWBR Barricade wireless router. The setup was very simple, using the installation CD that came with the card. The driver worked flawlessly first time and I was able to communicate immediately. I have tested the range of the card, going ""upstairs"" and the other end of the house and the signal strength is better than my SMC PC wireless adapter in my desktop. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,Easy setup,"This my first attempt of going wireless at home. I chose this product because price is cheap and it had good review from other customers.Good product. I have a IBM Thinkpad T21 running Windows XP Home Edition and a verizon DSL connection. I bought the SMC router and this card. I was able to set up my wireless connection in about half an hour. I live in a 2 bedroom appartment. The router is in my bedroom. When I am in the living room, the signal is 4/5. Driver installation was nicely handled by Windows XP."
2,Range is terrible,"I work at a wireless company and I am constantly testing wireless PC cards out. This brand card gave the worst reception out of all! Sitting 15 ft and 1 drywall away from the access point I got 60% signal quality, when others gave 95-100%. When I surrounded the end of the card with my cupped hand, (to cause signal drop), it dropped to 20% signal quality. Other cards only dropped to 60% to 75% signal loss. I know this isn't a very technical test, but it fared worst than some of the other major brands did."
3,"It's a great card, sort of.","I bought this to use with a Dell Inspiron 3800 laptop and the SMC Barricade Wireless router (which is FAB, btw.). I have yet (after many google searches, downloads, emails with customer support, etc.) to get the drivers for this card to load on the inspiron (win2k). However, I popped it into my Lattitude (work laptop) and was on the network in a couple of minutes. Go figure.The range is great--I have an 1100 sq ft condo--and I can take the laptop anywhere and the signal is strong. If it works for ya, hooray!"
5,An Excellent Product,"I recently wrote another review for the Linksys wireless pc card, and I can say that the SMC product is by-far a superior product.I got both the SMC Router and SMC wireless PC Card, and I'm completely satisfied with both. Set-up was a breeze and the drivers and software are rock solid.I was completely disatisfied with the Linksys combo. Read my review of the linksys wireless PC Card for more details.I've been using the SMC card and router for over a year, and I have not had a single problem with it. I've even dropped a soccer ball on the antennae, and cracked the casing (it's now bent at a 5 degree angle) and it still works like perfect.I think the product is terrific."
5,Love my Lug,What can I say. It's a lug wrench that serves its purpose. The product arrived on time and as promised.
4,Best album you've never heard of.,"This album is one of the best jazz albums I've ever heard, and I have all the classics by the 'masters.' He used to teach music in Berkeley, but I believe he's from the NY area orig. I played it once for some jazz musicians and they were impressed and knew a lot of the sidemen he used. Not personally, just that they were some notable players I didn't know about. I love this because it authentically sounds like it was from the 1956 to 1964 era of American jazz. It great they have this with samples so you don't have to take my opinion on it, but actually preview it!"
3,All that glitters ain't gold,"Good watch. Gold eventually rubs off. Accurate time piece. Looks good and packaging is impressive for a budget item. Good for a gift: Christmas, birthday, anniversary, graduation, etc."
3,Accurate Cover Depicting the Conductor in Fuzzy (Sound) Quality,"I agree that the conducting/execution could be more VIVID and PASSIONATE, but my major complaint is the sound quality. Sym 1 sounds like it was recorded in the 1940s (not the 1990s) and in a very dry room (similar to how Toscanini recorded for RCA many moons ago). That nearly ruined an otherwise successful reading. Furthermore, although the other symphonies sound a little better aurally, I find them all recorded low in volume, so the softer passages are all but inaudible on my CD player.I wish the Wergo set was still in print but I don't feel the need to splurge on another box set at $70 or so from an Amazon seller.My two cents."
4,Quiet Strength,Instructions are clear. Results are great; it covers all the areas from head to toe in a peaceful and gentle manner
2,disappointed--,"I purchased this video based on the all the favorable reviews and, as an older beginner, I am quite disappointed by it. There are no modifications shown for the poses and, although there are older people participating in the class, they are all able to do everything with no problem. This is discouraging. It does not show how to modify the poses using props of any kind. I am still looking for a video that shows more variation."
3,Dyscontents?,"I bought this book with the hope of obtaining the general insights derived from a long life led as an accomplished educator and translator. In part this was delivered. Mostly, however, ""If This Be Treason"" is focused on the various texts actually translated. (I have read none of these books.) Those who study or enjoy (or both) Latin American literature would appreciate more this memoir by Gregory Rabassa. I did learn a number of things about the art of translating, such as the often hard problem in getting the title to a book right. (Also, the jacket design includes two slightly different photographs of the same spiral staircase, nicely evoking the changed reality when a book is translated--even by the best.)"
4,reliable and flexible functioning,"i bought this clock so i wouldn't have to wake up to an irritating alarm... how shi-shi can i get, right? :) anyway, i wanted to wake up gradually to music that i like, and this little clock is great for that. it's pretty easy to use, and so far i've not had any trouble with it; however, the cd lid doesn't lift open -- you press it to open and close it, which seems like a delicate mechanism that could break after some usage. the clock does come with some useless functions as well: i haven't used the mystery answers and weird noises yet, and don't understand why anyone would... but anyway, the clock is reliable, the numbers are easy to read, and i can wake up to a janet jackson ballad, so i'll overlook the tacky blue color and the mish mash extras."
2,Keep looking,"An alarm clock with no buzzer, hmmmm......I bought this clock because it was cute and you could play cds in it, but that's about all it's good for. The mystery phrases are silly and although it's nice to be able to wake up to a cd or the radio, there are times when a nice, loud buzzzzzz it all that will wake me up. This clock is all style and no substance. Look elsewhere is my opinion."
2,Clock - ok -- CD - stinks,For the price I know I shouldn't have expected anything really great but the sound quality of this CD player is so bad that I can't stand to listen to it. Don't waste your money.
1,Can't rate what is not delivered,I ordered this item 3 weeks ago and it was in stock at the time. I used a gift certificate and super saver postage and to date have not received the item nor has it been shipped. When I get it I will rate it. The service is a zero.
2,Works but not realistic,"This will serve its purpose, but I can't put it too close to the door as it is an obvious fake. Having the back lid is good. I just have to place this in a part of my yard where folks won't be looking for a fake rock."
4,AWESOME MUSIC!!,"I got this title to help me with my piano playing, and so far it really has really helped. Most of this music is fast and breathtaking, at least in my opinion. The first CD has alot of cool songs, like Polonaise Op. 26 #2, Op. 44, Op. 53, and Op.61. But I don't like the piano player's style. The 2nd CD has alot of really cool songs in the beginning, like Polonaise Grande Op. 22, and Op. 71 #1. But the 2nd half of the 2nd CD is mainly boring songs. Overall this is an awesome CD set."
1,Will not work in Windows 7,"This software does not work in Windows 7.I tried all the possible ""compatibility"" settings with this software. None worked."
1,absolutely idiotic,"I just opened this comic book and it's completely moronic. I'm stunned by how stupid it is. In the first few pages, an overachieving Bible College student murders his dean because one of his professors tells him that the KJV isn't the inspired word of God.I mean.. it would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic"
3,"Beautiful video, stupid accent","This magnificently beautiful video would have been much classier without the annoying FAKE French accent from the female commentator, whose ""historical narrative"" was bland and devoid of any useful insight.Just keep the American accent in the main tract, and have an optional French-language tract. The French accent is beautiful in spoken French, not in any other language. American speech is also beautiful...there's no need to substitute."
2,Visions of France Only Partial,"I completely agree with another comment - I could not believe they made a Visions of France without any footage Paris and the wine region. I suspect they may be coming out with a Visions of France Part 2. At least I certainly hope so. I also agree that it's not as well done as Visions of Italy. Visions of Greece and England are also pretty well done. I just saw Visions of Ireland on public TV and can't wait until they release that one! I could have obtained it for a ""donation"" of ""only"" $100 but, at that price, I think I'll wait until Amazon gets it."
1,Buyer Beware,"This claims to be shot in HD but the DVD's are not blue ray and the quality of the video on new flat screens isn't very good. Also, at certain times the narration does not coincide with what is being shown. The narration script also seems jumbled up--the narrator will sometimes return to a previously shown topic at random."
4,A Vision of Parts of France,"We own and enjoy many of the videos in this series, but found this new one of France a bit lacking in a few areas. First we found it strange to call it Visions of France without any footage of Paris or the northern two thirds of the country. We found some of the scenes repetitive and the two regions covered are actually redundant in some areas. Unlike say, Visions of Italy, we found ourselves asking, ""Why don't they linger here some more?"" and ""Why aren't they zooming in for more detail?"" It is still an enjoyable video of some beautiful countryside, but in our opinion it is not up to the same quality as some of the earlier ones in the series."
5,"Beautiful, Relaxing & Informative",Great Disc! I only wish the company producing this series would hurry up and publish more discs on more places.Vivian
5,Viva La France! ~ Le Magnifique Journey,"Much like most of you out there I first became acquainted with the `Vision Series' of aerial travelogue features on PBS television. Whenever I came upon one while channel surfing I'd immediately put the remote down and sit back and relax. It wasn't long before I decided these programs were something I'd never tire of watching and needed to be added to my private DVD collection.Released in '06, `Visions of France' is the fourth high altitude tour in the series following `Visions of ... Greece / Italy and England'. As with the previous journeys the audience will be immediately whisked away far above the maddening crowd to view France in all its incredible architectural and agricultural glory. Add to the visuals an enchanting French soundtrack and soothing narration and your ready for departure!"
5,Dowland Lover,"I have had a affection for Dowland for a very long time. I loved ""In Darkness Let Me Dwell"" the minute I heard it and have played it repeatedly. I enjoy the liberties that were taken with this recording... they are surprising, and only enhance the sentiment of the work. I have many recordings of ""Come Again"",and this one is different than any other. The instrumental bridge, with it richness, is a wonderful contrast to the linear tenor voice. I am usually a purist with most music that I am familiar with... and it is rare that a new recording exceeds with a new take on the expected."
1,dont read it!!!,"this book is not good at all!!!!its not interesting: the plot is SOOOOOO shallow!!!!its not set in a ""back in the day"" time frame!!! though its made to believe it is!its not at all Christian: this is supposed to be Christian literature it is not! almost as blasphemous as ""the shack"" is! it condones this rebellious teenage brat having a baby outside of wedlock and all kinda mess! im sorry but in the Bible sin is sin. not cute!"
3,eh,"While the first cd amazed me, very few people enjoyed it like this cd. The cd was alright but wasnt good as the first one. Where is Reign in Blood? Anther cool thing about the first cd was they idea the band memebers, a picture, and a short bio on them. This cd does have a picture of the band, but thats about it. I wish they did it like they did on the first cd. A great cd but not as good as the first cd."
2,Look better than they are,"I needed some extra file space so when I saw these come up on the Friday sale, I decided to buy them. They looked pretty decent, but when they are assembled, they are just OK. The drawers don't fit real well, some of the finish is scratched, and the drawers were very hard to insert onto the tracks. It was definitely a 2-person job to get them in. But they serve my purpose. On the plus side, they have rollers so I can move them around the room."
1,USE CAUTION,Arrived with one of the major parts broken into two pieces. The next furniture I buy will be at a furniture store.
5,New Penguin Russian Course,"There's not much I can add to the positive reviews already noted, but just for the record, this book is extremely useful for dedicated and/or full-time (like myself) students of the Russian language."
4,Good Book for Beginers,"This book is good for those who want to learn Russian on their own. It starts out with the basic material, such as the alphabet and numbers, that some books/software assume you already know. The book works best when you combine it with a software program so that you can hear the words too."
2,Russian Course,Service from the seller was good. I found the book too academic and too disjointed in the way it's been put together. It attempts to do too much in too small a book. The first two chapters are helpful in learning the alphabet & pronunciation and the first 4 appendices at the back of the book are useful. I would probably use this if I couldn't find an understandable explanation in my other Russian books. Overall I would not recommend the book for beginners.
3,Usable Course,"I used this course before going to Russia in 2006; there I took a two week course - and showed the course to my teacher. The course (as most courses) are filled with grammatical errors, old language forms. However, they always help to build a base. Keep expectations low -- the Russian people are kind to new language learners and will help anyone making an effort."
4,very well pleased,My Husband and I are learning Russian for an assignment in Kazakhstan. We both ordered this book and we are very pleased. We are using the books to review what we are learning in language class. We feel the lessons are presented in a very methodical way and I personally find the exercises to be helpful in nailing the grammar. We highly recommend this course to accompany your language learning experience.
2,Russian Instructor: Why the rave reviews?,"I chose to use this book as the textbook for my Russian class because it was cheaper than Golosa or Nachalo. That was a mistake. The book includes all the grammatical information that you need to speak Russian, but a beginning Russian student needs more than just grammar. I don't know the author of this book, but I'm guessing that he doesn't place much importance on teaching. It seems he still adheres to the grammar-translation approach to teaching Russian. The organization of the book is confusing, neither thematic nor grammatical. The exercises are brief, and could have easily been lifted from a Russian textbook that was printed in the 50's or 60's. Frankly, I don't know why this book has gotten such rave reviews, unless it's being compared to not having any book at all. It's a lot cheaper than a real textbook, but there's a reason why it's cheaper. If you want a cheap way to learn Russian, check out the Berlitz Self-Teacher from the library."
4,Received Product Fast And In Good Condition,I am very pleased with the product I ordered through Amazon. I received my book 4 days earlier than expected and in very good condition. The only problem was the packaging they shipped it in wasn't good for a book and the back cover and 5 of the pages got bent during shipment. Otherwise I am very happy with the easy ordering and fast delivery.
4,overall it is alright,"it is ok/ It explains some things well, others - not so much. I wish the author understood that russian letter x sounds like h and not kh. But otherwise it has very good tables and samples of russian literature"
1,another weak language book,as usual this book thinks you already know what you are doing ....if you do why are you buying this book??? go buy Rosetta Stone and spend the money for this book on a nice wine from Chile
5,The best book on Russian grammar,"I have used several books and courses with tapes to learn Russian, and this book is one of the best. It clearly explains Russian grammar and makes a great supplement to a conversational Russian course. Growing up in Europe, I used to speak Russian as a kid. This book helped me get back into the Russian language. Russian, German and Latin are grammatically very difficult languages. It is impossible to read and write these languages without studying the grammar in depth.If you want to really learn Russian, buy this book!!"
5,Sent from up above!,"This is how I learn Russian. I am not done yet, but thanks to this book it worked for me to study this language myself. The more I learnt, the more I went to love Russian."
5,Well-written text at a good price,"The title says it all. If you are taking a college course, using Pimsleur, etc., then this text will be a very useful and affordable supplement. It does a great job describing the structure of the Russian language and how it differs from others, along with providing some basic vocabulary."
1,Who would pay for such information that is readily available on the Internet for free?,Who would pay for such information that is readily available on the Internet for free?
1,Full of Eisegesis,"This book is full of eisegesis. Webster defines the word ""eisegesis"" as the interpretation of a text (as of the Bible) by reading into it one's own ideas. The author went to great lengths to find biblical text to support ""his own"" ideas and views. If you read in ""context"" the scriptures that he used, you will find that none of them have anything to do with Black Greek fraternities or sororities.There are many books that give the true historical origins of these organizations, which have their roots in our African heritage. I would recomend that people read them to get a more objective view, then make up their own mind."
1,The pope is a Greek.,"Pope John Paul II is a brother of Phi Kappa Theta social fraternity, so is the Bishop of Pittsburgh. There are also many other religious figures who are Greek and many other Greek Letter Organizations which are founded on religious ideals.This book is completely devoid of any knowledgeable opinion on the subject of Greek life."
1,Don't buy this album,"This is a totally unauthorised bootleg of a third or 4th generation casette copy complete with drop-outs, incomplete tracks etc. Akarma records shoud know better. The original is great. If you want to hear it in it's full glory contact Baz through:www.olliehalsall.co.uk"
1,boooring,"Compared to other books like this, it has to be the most boring one I have read. Don't buy it."
2,XP Problems,"Be very careful if you have Windows XP.Since I installed my SMC USB wireless network adapter, I have been unable to dial into my ISP because the computer crashes eachtime Dial-Up Networking tries to connect. SMC have been no help. Uninstalling has not solved the problem. At least the network functions from time to time, so I can connect to the Internet over the network, as long as my notebook dials in (I have a wireless PC card on that machine)As far as I can tell, the drivers are simply not XP compatible.The network took a little time to set up. When it functions, it is great having the wireless connection. Using encryption drops transmission rates significantly below 11mbps, and for reasons that I cannot understand, it is erratic about whether it connects or not from time to time, especially with encryption selected."
5,Works great with Windows 98SE and Linksys WAP,I installed this adapter on a system running Windows 98SE. The adapater is plugged into a USB hub connected to the system. I use a Linksys Wireless Access Point. I have had no problems with the adpater. It receives a strong signal (> 80%) three rooms from the access point where the PC Card adapters get only a 33% signal strength.
3,Would be 5 stars if worked with Windows XP,"Despite SMC's website touting Windows XP this product has no driver yet that will work for XP. Sales people will claim it works with XP. It doesn't yet. Very happy with it until I upgraded to XP (to overcome MS OS unreliablility, not that XP is as good as claimed) so had to maintain a second phone line and ISP provider since my DSL now can only service one home computer."
1,Does not work,"Bought together with a router and a wireless laptop card. The USB adapter simply does not work. Software had problems with both Win2000 and XP. After downloading the latest version still no luck. Even though my PCs recognize the card, the utility that comes with it, does not find it! I guess you get what you pay for...."
5,Memorable Story--Offers Historical Perspective,"I read this book to my children MANY MANY times. It was a hand-me-down book when my first daughter was born in 1980. The illustrations are pure, cloying Eloise Wilkin, and pertain to a very narrow segment of a long-ago society, but it nevertheless soothing, comforting, and predictable--qualities that children love in books. Reading this book makes me wish that life was still that simple. I thought of this book often, over the years, for some reason, and was excited when it occurred to me that I could purchase it. The plot? A neighborhood of children walk to kindergarten each day, picking each other up along the way, pretending they are various professionals...mommies, firemen, policemen, and nurses. That's it. Nothing more."
1,Lost Faith...,"I was there when Black Oak played the University of Alabama in Huntsville and still have the poster/flyer. 1971 If I remember correctly. It was my first exposure to a rock band and I will never forget it. Ever. And I'm 54. It was a small venue of 100 people maybe and it rocked big time. And yes we were there right at ""420"".I bought the Black Oak Arkansas Album and was hooked!. I still love it today.I have the very first rare album too. With ""When I Smoke I Like to Sleep"". LOL.But this album was the lame. Boring. Sorry...but it is just isn't any good. Blah...They did a few songs after that album that were fine...but they were not on this disk. I give it a thumbs down. But then remember that is just this goobers opinion."
1,Warning!,"Just to let any interested purchasers know, this clock does not, I repeat NOT have a plain Beeping function. You can only wake up by your preset radio station turning on, or a continuous loop of lame guitar riffs. Also, just to let you know, the ""Mystery Phrases"" are prerecorded Magic Eight Ball Answers like a girl saying ""Like, No Way!"" or a guy saying ""You Bet!"", ""For Sure!"", or whatever. Another flaw is that the black projection is almost impossible to see in the dark. The forwards or backwards time setting buttons do make setting the time and alarm easier, but that is the only good thing I can tell you about this clock. Enjoy!"
4,They Fit.,"These pads are the right shape and come with anti-squeal backing plates (if they haven't fallen out of the box- there is no securing packaging). You will be tempted to reuse your old hardware after examining the contents of the box, but in my case the light-duty application and plenty of anti-squeal red goo prompted me to use the product anyway. And I am ""Satisfied"", though ""Premium"" could be just as well applied to a McDonald's regular hamburger."
3,Middling adventure,"This here's a so so space adventure novel. Not as good as Dietz' ""Legion of the Damned"" or ""Runner"". I'd suggest reading some of the author's other books which are more inventive and much more fun."
1,Junk,Used the machine a total of 3 time then the LCD screen went blank had just passed warranty company was of no help. Would strongly advise against this unit
4,"Good, so far - Update","Had it for one week. Plays everything I threw at it, dvd+rw, dvd-r, dvd+r, cd/r/rw, mp3, audio cd, vcd, svcd, etc. Only thing it didn't play was svcds created with Nero. on't know why. Battery is good for about 3 1/2 hours.Image is definitely nicer than Mintek's and comparable to other more expensive brand names. Overall, a great player, as long as it doesn't die on me after three month warranty.Update - 2 yrs laterBought this Christmas of 2004. Still works great! Developed two bad pixels. Also lost remote so can't fast forward/reverse or choose audio mode. Can only advance by chapters. Battery is still very good, at least 2 1/2 hrs to 3 hrs. Dropped it at least ten times in the car and twice in the kitchen. Kids sometimes play videogames with av input. Plays mpeg2 files. Wish I could edit the star rating to 5."
4,nice one,"So far it's been great and it's one of the few portable players that will go region free through the remote, one of the main reasons I got this one. Plays my Dutch discs just fine!"
3,Useful for Applications OTHER THAN AIRSOFT,"Carol's son: I bought this silicone lube because a previous review said it was okay to use to lubricate airsoft GBB magazines (with plastic o-rings). I thought it was a very good deal considering it gives you about 3X more than the small airsoft spray cans. Sadly to my surprise, it says on the back, ""DO NOT USE ON PLASTIC,"" in bold.In the end, it was my fault for not doing the research. I wish it specified that in the item description. Learn from my mistake.BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT buy for plastics, especially airsoft guns."
3,Better read while a little drunk,"A delightfully silly book. Almost every character behaves as if a little crazy or high on something, and I suppose it would all make sense if the reader were also high on something, or at least a little bit drunk. Plus the Kindle version is full of typos, and the translation was a half-hearted effort. I stopped reading about half way into the book and returned it. But I might enjoy reading it aloud in the company of friends, just for fun."
4,Amusing existential detectives,"The illogical plot in this story is more than offset by the offbeat, unpredictable but wise interplay between the characters and the meandering plot developments. I liked it quite a bit.The Kindle adaptation, on the other hand, was strewn with typos and strange typefaces, which was moderately distracting."
1,Panel is malformed,The packaging on the outside was in good condition. The water panel inside was malformed and wouldn't fit inside the humidifier. I wasn't about to go through the drill of a return as I needed the product for seasonal replacement. Some things are just better bought in the store.
4,Replacement filters,"Great price and did the job for me. This was a difficult product to find at my local heating and air conditioner dealers, but found it immediately on your site."
3,male dancing lacks,"Don't buy this movie for the male dancing or sad Nutcracker choreography, but for the Macmillan segments with Alessandra who was his most beloved muse. Her performance and passion alone are a reason to buy it but don't bother with her lacking partner."
4,Good =],It has their highlights but not type of ballet video you will want to watch over and over... but surely is worth it... especially for its price =]
5,"SUPPLEMENT TO ""SEAT OF THE SOUL""","In order to get the most from this tape, you have to be familiar with Gary Zukav and his work. I would suggest reading first his wonderful ""Seat of the Soul"",then the information contained in ""Authentic Power"" will make sense to you. I have received so much enlightenment from this man's writings, and hope that he will bless us with more books of wisdom."
1,Waste of money,"I felt ripped off by this. Should be priced around $2.00 tops. It's a staged interview (kinda embarrassing actually), and a total money making effort. Contentless."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money,This single tape is a one hour radio interview. It is not an abridged reading of a book. There is very little content. And the recording is not professionally done. I found it annoying listening to these two men wheeze and swallow for an hour while expounding on meaningless new age jargon. There was nothing that was helpful about obtaining Authentic Power.
1,waste of money,"I read the reviews on this movie before i bought it. And i was led to believe that it was going to be good. But all it was, was a bunch of interviews, and a guy saying a ghost took over his body and which his acting was fake. And you can hardley understand anything they are saying cause the sound quality on the movie is bad. So it's not worth geting at all."
3,Great singles add up to a mediocre whole,"I heard her on internet radio -- and I loved the sound. I read the reviews and thought, ""A little classic Joplin mixed with a healthy dose of McLachlan all wrapped in a Christian package? How can you beat that?""Unfortunately, the album doesn't play well straight through. On a single-by-single basis, Sarah Kelly sounds great, but the whole project owes as much to Steve Green as it does to Alanis Morisette. A weird combination, I know, and 45 minutes straight through just doesn't play well. Put it in the iPod and shuffle it through your other 4000 songs, and you'll love it. Play it straight through, and you'll feel like you're at a retro-Christian concert for up-and-coming inspirational artists. Not quite the healthy dose of creativity and gutsy rock I was looking for."
4,Good Classic Film,Just a good standard film of its day that I enjoy putting in when I have a few chores to accomplish.
5,"Highly recommended comedy, exceptional for its believability","This obscure movie really should have been professionally released to DVD by now. It is superb. It's a movie I can honestly consider ""perfect"", filled with comedy of mistaken identity and new situations, helped by outstandingly clever writing, and imbued with patriotism. It's not a goofy movie like many ""screwball comedies"", but instead has more well-rounded human qualities. Screwball comedies can be good (I really like the original, It Happened One Night), but I think their breezy style and one-dimensional supporting characters would have cheapened this movie. In short, I think the humor on this movie has depth, assisted by the believability of the characters; they don't underplay or overplay, just play normal people. The absence of smoking is also nice in this movie."
4,One of the most delightful romantic comedies of the 40s.,"A first-rate romantic comedy, one of the best of its era. Charles Coburn gets third billing but steals the show in probably his all-time best role, as a ""spy"" for a large department store, masquerading as a sales clerk. Heartwarming without being overly sentimental, and thoroughly delightful."
5,"Fast Delivery, Quality Product",This item was a gift I had sent to my father for his birthday. He got his gift in a timely manner. He is really enjoying his gift. Thanks for the fast and quality services.
2,Over-Interpreted Beethoven,"If you like in your Beethoven:1. Slower tempos.2. More rubato.3. Beautiful Tone.4. More depth.5. Less Intensity.6. Digital Sound.Then this is probably the set for you.If you don't, then PLEASE try Gulda's set for about $25 dollars less on Brilliant Classics. His tone is nice but he doesn't have any of the above qualities. I have both of these sets and like about a third of Barenboims interpretations, while I enjoy more than two thirds of Gulda's."
2,A very boring set!,"I'm very sorry to say, but in my opinion this sonata cycle is by far the most boring I've heard since the Richard Goode set!The performances lack life, vitality, involvement, energy, brilliance, wit etc. up until the Appassionata onwards, where he picks things up.I was very pleased with his EMI set, but I truly couldn't stand this one. Sure, there are some nice moments he does well, but overall he doesn't do it for me...all one has to do is compare him to Annie Fischer or Schnabel for that matter to know what I'm talking about.Not only that but the DG sound is pretty boring as well, it's like elevator music! Nothing comes through...it's like monophonic sound done in stereo!Sorry Barenboim fans :("
3,Waterloo,"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD based on my interest in the history, the well known actors and producer. However, I was immediately disappointed by the video quality. Although the crisp blue-ray quality was not expected, what was presented appears to be a poor VHS transfer to DVD. It was blurred and irritating to watch. No doubt a clearer presentation would have been enjoyable considering the spectacular settings and promising cinematography."
1,THIS SO CALLED RUSSIAN IMPORT IS A CROCK.,"firstly this movie is a British film, the only thing Russian about it is the fact that the Russian army lent their services to make up the extras numbers, they needed a lot of men to recreate the battle. This film does not have any extra featuresand isn't any longer than the original release. The only version of this film on dvd, that is the same as the theatrical release is the Asian version, which comes with an English language option. I can't believe this so called Russian movie was actually selling for big bucks a couple of months ago."
4,Strategic Business Letters and E-Mails,"This would be a handy reference for business professionals. With its good contents and fair price it sells for, I will say, ""It is worth having a copy in one's library""."
5,CLASSIC 50s horror film!!,"I loved this film as a kid growing up (I saw it on a Saturday afternoon classic film showing in the 80s). And I have loved watching it occasionally since. This really shows simple filmmaking of the day, the themes of fear of nuclear energy of the 50s, and a great performance by James Whitmore!I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates classic horror/suspense films!!"
5,THEM!,A classic sci-fi from the 50's with good effects and a story line that is believable with humor added. I loved this film when first seen (and still do) and I am very glad I added this to my collection! It has many first rate actors also.
5,THEM a favorite of mine growing up..,"I saw this movie with my best friend when in 5th grade on a Friday night movie special with Goulardi from the Cleveland TV Station. I was so pleased to find it out on DVD and just love watching it. Brings back happy memories, even if we were in the middle of the Cold War."
5,Great Old Time Sci-Fi,"Todays movies have so much blood and gore you can't let your kids see them. This movie has just the amount of suspense you need. Sure it's old, the special effects are no where near todays movies, but it's still a great old black and white movie that you can sit and watch without flinching when something bad happens. It is not Freddy versus Jason!"
3,Alright I would say...,Worst Ending...Nuff said. This movie is fairly well but it has the worst ending ever in to world... that's why i gave it a 3.
5,Essential science-fiction cinema,"THEM! is an eminently watchable flick in its own right and one of the essential science-fiction movies of the 1950s -- along with THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, FORBIDDEN PLANET, and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. There are others we love (I myself have a great and abiding fondness for I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, and some folks swear by WAR OF THE WORLDS), but these five, though they did not exhaust the genre (as Hollywood understood the genre), certainly defined it during their decade and well into the 1960s, until 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."
4,"""Them"" a good old scifi movie","Ok, so this might not be for every one, but for people who like the monster flicks like godzilla or king kong you should check this out. The dvd fetures are good considering most old scifi movies have no dvd fetures. The acting of this movie is very typical of the time it was made but it's good acting. The plot allows it to be some what belivible even with the out dated effects."
5,The Ultimate Giant Ant Movie,"Big, big ants, lost in the desert; James Arness; great production values. A 50s sci fi classic; buy."
4,Great!,"Well, I haven't seen the DVD version yet, but I've seen this movie many times ( I recorded it from TCM or something;)It's a great flick with that horror feeling U just don't get these days and I can recommend it big time!The effects are of course not that great but the acting and the whole scenario of these giant monsters ""invading"" is terrific.I love this movie!"
5,Great Premise,the very concept this film proposes is thought provoking. the mere idea of collossol ants threatening the survival of mankind is phenomenal. whether atomic radiation would actually cause such a mutation is irrelevant. this movie is worthy of honored recognition in the National Film Archives as one of the greatest sci-fi classics of the 1950s.as for the DVD. excellent transfer. it just doesn't seem possible this 48 year old film could look this good. the special features are adequate( though a documentary on ants and their natural habitat would have complemented the DVD even more )and this DVD is imperative to anyone's library of film.
4,THEM!,"THEM! was before its time. The storyline was well thought out and executed. James Whitmore and James Arness carried the story from the deserts of New Mexico to storm water drains of Los Angeles, California. The ants were believable and this movie is well worth watching again and again."
4,"""EEK! It's THEM! THEM! THEM!''","This is a fun black and white horror sci-fi flick from the '50s. The special effects may seem dated in our age of CGI, and the idea of genetically mutated ants may seem cheesy, but the strong performances, cool facts about entomology and the chilling musical score/sound effects make up for it. (Believe it or not, this movie may teach you some stuff about the life of ants.) The sound and picture quality of this DVD are very good, but I found the special features to be a bit of a let down. Still, I recommend this movie to any one who enjoys these old sci-fi, horror movies."
5,Spooktacular!,"This is a dream come true for fans of this film. The cover art is GREAT, having been adapted from the original poster art. The menus are fun, reading like sensationalistic newspaper headlines. The transfer ROCKS. I've never seen this film look so good. Detailed textures and fine contrast. Some nice extras with some rare test footage. I had misgivings when I saw the advanced images of the cover art, which depicted the old laser cover. Those misgivings are laid to rest! I am a happy camper! Wait...is that formic acid I smell?"
5,A great film for any idiot savANT.,"Them! is a great movie - solidly entertaining all the way through. The premise seems cliched, but this is the source of all the inferior imitations that followed, and when you see the original you will understand why so many wanted to rip it off! In the desert of New Mexico, gigantic ANTS are discovered to be the result of nuclear testing. Thus begins this insect extravaganza extraordinaire. This is a great movie for kids especially, but adults will probably get a kick out of it too. Don't worry - it won't disappoint."
3,THEY! THOSE! THEM!,"THEM! are giant killer ants. THEM! is far more slow-paced than the monster movies of today. THEM! doesn't have enough killer ant action, but what it does have is pretty darn cool. THEM! See it today...while you still can."
2,THEM! has not aged well over the past 55 years,"I saw this movie when I was a kid and found it somewhat scary. Today, it just seems slow, clunky and dated. It attempts to build suspense by taking about 1/3 of the movie to reveal that there are - gasp! - GIANT ANTS on the loose in the American Southwest, but overall there's little action until the closing reel. Along the way, we are treated to a lecture on ants (complete with old film clips) and some dubious science to explain why a colony of ants could grow to 10 feet in size in only ten years. The acting is adequate - look for Fess Parker as a patient in a mental hospital - but no more, and the overall preachy tone grows tedious. Worth watching as a historical artifact, but don't expect edge-of-your-seat suspense."
2,Where's Harryhausen when ya need him?,"Frankly, I was quite bored with this one. Although the acting was above par for the time, the screeching of the ants made me irritated after a while and I didn't think the effects were at all impressive compared to what Harryhausen was doing at the time. I'll never understand why this is looked on as a classic but Beast from 20,000 Fathoms or 20 Million Miles to Earth are never mentioned."
3,"Them, Ants Drive Me Nutz!","Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Theese ants truly do drive me crazy! They sound like car alarms! And then there is the little girl (""Them! Them! Waaaa!""). Anyway, once you get past this,the film is actualy pretty good considering the monsters are flame-mune ants! If you care, the film was originally going to be in color but they thought the ants looked more realistic in B&W.; I reccomend THEM![...]"
5,THEM! THEM! THEM!,"One of the all time great giant bug movies! The giant ants are so vivid in this excellent 50' sci-fi movie it is one time I'm glad they didn't use stop motion to create the ants. Ray Harryhausen could have made some cool looking monster ants for this film, but the giant ants in this feature are unforgettable. Good story,cast and some cool looking giant bugs make this a classic. The DVD transfer is nice only why did they colorize the title letters in the opening?"
5,THEM...ONE OF THE BEST !,"This is one of the best of the 50's ""B"" movies...in my opinion right up there with the original ""THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL""..sure,by todays standards,the special effects are not great...but remember this was the 50's and for that time they were great...I love the movies of this era and this is one of the best of the ""nature gone wild/technology gets us into another mess"" movies of all time...much better than ""eight legged freaks""...which I also enjoyed..but it's not on the level of ""THEM""."
5,love those ants,"I have always loved this movie so when I could get it for the Kindle Fire, I went for it. Anyone who likes fifties monster movies will love this. It is a classic."
4,Really good movie.,"I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't too violent and the giant ants were great. This movie actually had a plot that could be followed. Overall, I would recommend seeing it, especially if you life old sci-fi movies."
5,A movie worth the ant-icipation.,"The formula is Big Bugs, Flame throwers and screaming women. What happened as an aftereffect of the first atomic bombs?This is a movie about taller-ants.Fess Parker almost gets cough with his pants down.This is not a fly-by-night movie. It is an ant-by-night movie.William Schallert ""Colossus - The Forbid Project"" ASIN: 6300987531, gets to be the Ambulance Attendant.Leonard Nimoy is the Telex operator. If this keeps up, he may find himself on a starship, where he can deal with ant-imatter.James Arness only wants to help Joan Weldon out of a plane and into the ant-ichamber.I watched this several times with my wife. The ants make a noise similar to a loose fan belt. So every time we pass a car with a loose fan belt she says, ""Get the other antenna.""This movie also makes a good background movie. Don't wait for this to go on clear-ants.Bamboo Saucer [VHS] ~ Lois Nettleton"
5,Them= Fun,"I'm a sucker for bad movies, and b-movie horror thriller ""Them"" fits the bill. When a mute little girl is found wandering the desert alone, she is picked up by two police officers who discover her parents have been the victim of a savage attack.The officers, a team of government agents, a plucky scientist, and her doddering dad put two and two together and discover a mutant menace in the desert. It is soon a race against time to find the ant hives before the ants reproduce.Them was a fast-paced pulp action film. Entertaining for horror buffs and history buffs."
5,Them!,"Them! would have to fill the #1 spot on my list of great bug movies of the 50's. An excellant cast of future stars and the bugs aint bad either. A-bomb testing does it again, this time in the form of giant ants. The DVD plays clean and crisp in fact ive never seen this movie look this good."
5,"Oh yea, Giant Killer Ants","One of the best ""giant insect"" flicks from the era that gave us the 200' flying Mantis, the Fly, Mothra and more - comes ""Them."" OK, lousy title, great movie. If the SF channel made this it would have been called ""Attack of the CIA created Giant Ants"" and would have sucked - so ""Them"" is not that bad a title after all.It's the best big bug flick ever made - remember - it's models, practical effects - no computer effects. So sure, you can tell it's a model in many scenes - but so what. The plot is decent, the directing dead-on, acting is good - and the movie is older than most people watching it. ""Them"" stood the test of time.All hail our giant ant overlords!"
5,Watch out on your next picnic!,"The best bug movie ever made, with simple props and a great cast. Whitmore saving the poor kids while losing his life and Marshall Dillon smoking a few along the way. Great flick!"
2,Worst Product Ever!,"I picked this product up because I liked the liquid wax (which is still the best you can buy under $10). Tried it on my S2000 wheels that had about a month of dirt and grim from the rain and roads. Followed the instructions by spraying it on and leaving it on for 2 mins then power washed it off.It failed on really dirty wheels but was ""ok"" on lightly dirty onesThe product performed like soap and water. It got rid of the ""loose dirt"" but it could have easily gotten off by just my pressure hose! 2 stars for soap and water."
1,worst wheel cleaner I've ever used,"Have used different wheel cleaners over the years - picked this up on special somewhere - and it's no better than soap and water. A good wheel cleaner should take the brake dust down to the tire - a soso cleaner should at least loosen the stuff in a uniform fashion so you can get it with a sponge - this stuff really does nearly nothing, it actually kinda gums up little rays of it on the wheel, making it a little more of a pain to get the concentrated spots off."
2,False Advertising,Before I bought this I used 409 and a rag to clean my wheels. It worked just as well as this. Clearly I need to buy a wheel brush to use along with any cleaner. When you think about it any cleaner that could REALLY remove all that brake dust and road grime would probably be unsafe to be spraying around and rinsing into the gutter. Think I'll use up this bottle (with a wheel brush) and go back to 409 or the car wash bucket. Nothing worth doing is ever easy.
1,No magic in the bottle,I have a 2005 Honda van and I used the Black Magic rim cleaner today for the first time. The product DOES NOT do what it states and I was very disappointed with the results. You can get the same results by just using soap and water. I think the reason that they tell you to dry with a towel is the fact that the brake dust and dirt are still on the wheel rim after the application. Do not buy this product if you do not want to be disappointed like I was!
1,Worthless,"This product has absolutely no effect when applied as directed. If you want to scrub this will work about like a spray bottle with soapy water in it.EDIT: I have slowly taken a liking to this product as I've experimented over time, but to get your money's worth you have to ignore the directions (though take note of the warnings). What you want to do is put a couple sprays on a paper towel so it's moist and then the brake dust just wipes away. I have pretty serious brake dust issues on my RX-8 so it takes a couple PT's per rim even after 100 miles or so, but it makes a huge difference on the overall look of the car to have nice clean rims. You can also push the paper towel with a finger about two knuckles deep into a lug nut brush and it actually cleans the gunk out of there (which is darn near impossible to get any other way)."
5,Hope It Works!,I have read good reviews but it will take years before I know how well it works. Hopefully it performs as advertised. I believe it to be better then other major stabilizer manufacturers...time will tell.
5,item as described,ClueFinders 5th Grade is doing the same thing for my niece as it did for my sons. They are learning while playing. And gain a great deal of confidence in their skills.
1,"Evidentally, the disc could not be played in New York City","I returned the DVD to the seller in England (London). When I tried to play it, the message was that it ""could not be played in this [New York City] region."" I mailed the DVD back for a refund.--Milton Horowitz"
1,Not even a funny read,"Horrible book written by an old ""reformed"" white racist male who is a fundamentalist Christian. What can he possibly relate to regarding the social structure of the Black community, which Farrakhan addresses? During the 60s when Blacks were fighting for their rights getting killed on the streets, the author of this book was on the side of the white cops.Horrible book. Wish I could have given it negative stars; black holes, rather, lol.Anton Batey"
4,Good big band sound,"This is a good album with great horns. I liked the arrangements. Newer big band music without sounding too ""smaltzy"", if you know what I mean. Very enjoyable."
1,"Exact copy of ""The Best Book of Spaceships"", by same author","The book itself is totally fine, but we ordered it together with another book by the same author, called ""The Best Book of Spaceships"", and 90% of the pages are the exact same. It's bogus for an author to make two separate titles with the same book, and bogus for Amazon to sell both unless it has an obvious disclosure that the books are redundant. Amazon shouldn't even let you put both in your cart unless you click to agree that the books are the same."
4,Darkly textured dance music,"This album is great music to drive around alone at night to. Electronic, with eerie saxophones in the background wailing like a haunted banshee. Unlike most electronic music, this isn't sterile and mechanized sounding. No no no, this music is brooding, organic and full of life even though it sounds like music made by the dead. These ladies get a solid 4 stars, only because I would of liked to hear more improv with the saxs."
5,The Glory of a Goddess,"I got this video way back in 1998 when I was in high school with a burgeoning obsession with Stevie. It was the visual companion to the already mystifying rock and roll all her albums offered. I take this video everywhere I go, because I need to see the energy that Stevie created on this first tour of hers since going solo, about every 3 months. I do wish they'd release it on DVD, especially considering the Red Rocks concert has been on DVD since the early rise of that media format. I find it extremely gross how high sellers are trying to sell this video given one can just as easily see it on youtube, but I guess that's how greedy people get in harsh economic times. I greatly recommend viewing it on youtube, or seeing if people on ebay are more price friendly sellers than those here. But this is Stevie in all her majestic glory and if you're a fan like me, you'll definitely become hooked on it."
1,LOST IN THE MAIL,"I bought this video from Buybackstudios in Toldedo Ohio, and it ended up getting lost in the mail.Buybackstudios said it was delivered here on 1-7-2010, however, I never got it.The advise from Buyback was to complain to the postmaster and have the letter carier be held responsible for the cost of this tape, and or have him assigned to another route.I guess what I can say, for me, that it wasn`t one of the more expensive ones...this one only put me out $ 21.00, however, I`m going to have to try and buy another one."
2,"Great Hardware - Poor software, Poor support","The audiotron is a great little box, but the technology has passed it by. If you try to use it with a Windows 2003 Server, with active directory, you will encounter no end of grief.Googling the problem, you will find several suggestions on how to fix this, including hacking your security settings in the group policy.However, in some cases none of the suggestions work. Turtle Beach is of NO HELP WHATSOEVER - they justify this by saying they never claimed to support the Windows Server 2003 environment, so you are on your own. They show no indication that this may be fixed in forthcoming updates.My advice - if you have a full Active Directory on Win3K Server - steer clear of this product, there are better ways to hear your music."
2,"Warning, legacy speed support ONLY!","This device ONLY supports a 10base-t network. I just bought this unit and might have to return it unless I can figure out a way to make it work.Odd that a unit that relies on the network to receive music would not support 100mb networks. The more bandwidth the better, I say. Not likely to sell into any business that has 100mb only. I'd consider this a mistake and one that I did not expect in a network appliance at this time in networking where practically everything supports 10/100 based networks.Surprised and not impressed with that limitation...Something that should be fixed in any future version..."
1,Big Mistake!!,"Bought this item for my 12 year old great nephew as a Christmas present. Imagine my embarrassment when I gave it to him today and we tried to watch it. I tried four, yes four, different DVD players in my home and it wouldn't load on any of them. Unfortunately as I purchased this item back in August the return date has expired. I am furious to say the least. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
2,Scratched-New DVD,The dvd (Fred Claus) was wrapped and brand new however when I opened the dvd case the dvd was all scratched and stopped working after 45min.
1,Horrible picture quality,"I wonder if the distribution companies plan to underproduce DVDs in an effort to get us all over to Blu-ray more quickly. The video quality looks like a 3 year old VHS tape that I recorded to DVD myself. Just to compare/confirm, I popped in my DVD of Will Ferrell's ""Elf"". Sure enough, it looked fine. ""Fred Claus"" has a blotchy look. I don't remember thinking this when I saw it in the theater."
1,Unwatchable,"It started out so good, then something awful happened. This movie is completely unwatchable."
4,funny movie,i love vince vaughn. this is a cute little holiday movie & it is pretty funny. i would recommend this movie for family night
3,Disappointing-,Not really the family movie I was wanting it to be. It was O.K. Just an alright Christmas movie. It was missing the thread of reality to be able to get lost in a magical Christmas film.
4,CLassic holiday fun - vince vaughn is the man!,Classic holiday fun! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++ =++++++++++ +++++++ +++++ ++++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ ++ ++ += ++ + ++ =
4,Funny movie,It is a funny movie. I like Vince Vaughn as an actor. Enjoy the North Pole set up. Makes you want to be a kid again and go see the toy factory.
5,Excellent,"This creative movie is a delight to watch. A new idea is developed into a film that concludes with warmth, heart, and wholesome moral values. Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kathy Bates, and Kevin Spacey are excellent, and their talents are well utilized. The movie is funny and enjoyable throughout, with a loving yuletide spirit at the end that is truly moving. Of course suspension of disbelief is required, but so it is in most children's movies. My ten-year-old grandson loved it as did his grandfather and I. It is rightfully billed as this season's holiday classic."
3,Merry Christmas,"Funny movie, the stupid thing is Amazon does not let you download and play the movie with out the crappy ""box"" player."
2,something to watch for the holidays,"this movie was OK.the premise was good and some of the scenes were funny.yet somehow it never ""took off"" and slogged along with the usual mediocrity seen in these holiday films."
2,"Great cast, stupid plot","This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Guess I thought it would be more of a dark humor story, not a goody-goody kid film.There were good actors in this film, Paul Giamatti, Kathy Bates, Kevin Spacey, Vince Vaugh, but all were wasted in this cheesy Christmas film."
3,Just OK - Barely,"Not an absolutely awful movie. I watched the whole thing and didn't feel the desire to turn it off midway through. On the other hand, I had a lot of time to kill. It's a movie that tried to appeal to both kids and adults, and as a result is likely to really please nobody. Kids will think it's OK. Adults probably won't like it much. If I'd paid more than $0.99 to rent it, I would've been very unhappy, but at under a dollar, it was an OK time killer."
2,"Disjointed, poor script and above all....unfunny?!","How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days."
2,Fred Clause DVD,"Fred Claus is a Christmas movie about the older brother of St. Nick himself. It shows them going up as brothers where Nick loves to do good, and Fred becomes more and more jealous and bitter.They go their separate ways most of their life until one year Fred visits Nick. Their lifelong conflict comes to a full blown conflict and they begin restoring their relationship after that point. Fred comes into his own and advocates for all children, not just the good ones and becomes the hero of the hour.There was a scene that was really fun I liked where Fred has the elves play a song other than the one they always played and they all ensue in a very fun, creative dance that's very joyful and fun.Other than that scene, this movie just didn't hold my attention, it didn't do anything for me. It's a Christmas movie that just didn't do it in my opinion."
2,WHO KNEW CHRISTMAS COULD BE THIS DEPRESSING!,"With a cast this good, its amazing that this film is so bad! The first two thirds of the film are so depressing that I almost couldn't imagine watching this in the holiday season. Of course the ending is predicatable and uplifting, but the journey there is rather dull. It's just too little, too late.The film is over loaded with special effects and not much else. It's not dark enough to be a black comedy and it's not sentimental enough to give you that classic holiday feeling. HO HO Hummmmmm!"
5,Brought Cheer,"My sister and I saw this movie after we lost our uncle, a guy who had a great sense of humor and was a wonderful person. This movie brought some light to our day and so I wanted to get it for her. A fun holiday movie."
4,Fun Holiday Movie,A light hearted entertaining holiday film. Nice message enforcing family values and highlighting the true spirit of Christmas. Acting was good and visuals were appealing. Nicely done.
3,Fred Claus,This movie was delivered to me in a good amount of time and it was in great condition and new.
1,The dark heart of Christmas?,"After watching this movie I realized I had not laughed once, and that's rare for me. There are other 'modern' Christmas movies that carry off the sarcastic side of Christmas without letting cynicism sink it to this kind of low. Kevin Spacey, a phenomenal actor, was given a banal bit part which he tried his best to carry off, that of an efficiency expert who carries Santa's ""pink slip"" in his pocket. Paul Giamatti and Vince Vaughn played it very convincingly, but the creative talents of Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson had no place in which to shine. The ending did nothing to lift spirits, and it was frankly weird when at the end Fred and Nick's mother implies that her own son (Fred) is a little outclassed by his love interest, who plays a meter maid (Rachel Weisz). What kind of mother says that about her own son (even in real life), especially after he just saves Christmas?"
4,Cute Movie!,If you enjoy Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti then you'll love this movie. It was too cute!
2,Not funny or joyful,"Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz, Kathy Baker...all Oscar winners. This movie? Complete Razzie. We saw this for free and yet I still wanted a refund. Just not funny or entertaining. It's Christmas movie! Where was the joy? Where was the love? Not everything needs to be Elf or It's A Wonderful Life but no matter which kind of movie a holiday flick is, it has to be good such as Bad Santa. Not a family film but good. This film does have an awesome soundtrack so I will recommend that."
4,Good Holiday Fun,"Ok, seriously, now how can a movie with Vince Vaughn as Santa's brother not be good???? This is a very entertaining holiday movie both for children and adults, it's lots of fun to watch as a family, and there is actually a moral to the story! Sure to become a classic."
4,More of Elizabeth Banks please...,"A wonderful feel-good Christmas movie, Fred Clause, brings to the screen the story of Santa Clause's older brother whose life took a turn toward naughtiness following the birth of the sibling who the world will refer to as St. Nicholas.Fred Clause is a film about Christmas, human relations, hope and second chances as well as trust, love, and inner strength.Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Elizabeth Banks (who is GORGEOUS!) and the rest of the cast, have done an excellent job with their performances, though Rachel Weisz seems out of place in this movie, i.e. an Englishwoman handing out traffic violation tickets in Chicago is rather unlikely. Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good!Though not a masterpiece, Fred Clause is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!"
2,Is it almost over?,"If I hadn't paid money to rent this last year, I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. My nine year old picked this movie after seeing the previews advertised over and over and after 30 minutes he left to go watch t.v. in his room. The previews contained all the funny parts so it left the movie pretty dull. Definitely not a heartwarming, get in the Christmas spirit kind of movie. Ho, Ho, Ho, Hum!"
4,Another Great Chistmas Movie!,Fred Clause is a great movie for children of all ages. It has a lot of adult humor which also makes it enjoyable for us.
4,A good Christmas 2007 movie,"For the month or so as well as the past year or two, Hollywood has been releasing a string of disappointing or downright bad Christmas movies (The Golden Compass, Happy Feet, Deck the Halls). Thankfully, Fred Claus was a pleasant surprise.I agree with some of the reviews. This is not the funniest Christmas movie that I have seen. Then again, it does not really need to be. Vaughn is funny overall. He was funnier than he was in 'The Break-Up' (not hard to do). It is generally a good story with a fair amount of good laughs along with a good, semi-touching story.The other thing I do when I see a Christmas movie is ask ""Do I want to add this to my movie collection when it comes out on DVD?"" My answer is definitely yes.In summary, it is fairly good movie. It is worth seeing. You decide after that if it is good enough to add to the home Christmas movie collection."
5,Nice!,"This Movie Is For Kids It's Rated PG. You Guys Are Making It Sound Like It Was Suppose To Win A Bunch Awards Or Something. It's A Family Holiday Movie. My 3yr Old Nephew Sat Through This Entire Movie And That Has Never Happened Before. Paul Giamatti Was A Great Santa That Loved His Brother Through Think or Thin. Kevin Spacey My Number 1 Actor Of All Time Plays The ""Bully"" I Guess You Can Say And He Plays Him Well. Fred(Vince Vaughn)Is Just A Misunderstood Guy That Can't Live Up To His Brother Being Santa Claus. And His Mother(Kathy Bates) Doesn't Help This Situation At All. The End When The Kids Open Their Gifts Takes Me Back To When I Was 5 And So Happy With What Santa Claus Brought Me. Give It A Chance And Remember They Made It For The Kids Not Just You."
5,Funny Christmas,"OMG, this movie was so funny. Its clean enough for the kids to watch but funny enough where I enjoy it as well."
3,More serious than expected,"Overall enjoyed the film, but more serious tone than expected - a little ""dark"" at times. Watched with 6 year old and she was entertained, although some mild physical violence and language which may not be appropriate for all young kids."
3,"Ho, Ho, Ho!","""Fred Claus"" is a madcap comedy about Santa and the problems, and love, generated by his family. Fred (Vince Vaughn) is Santa's (Paul Giamatti) older, fast talking hustler brother who irritates everyone of whom he tries to take advantage. Santa's wife wants to protect him from Fred, but Santa tries to exercise tough love when he gives Fred a job. Fred's conduct plays into the hands of a vengeful efficiency expert who is scheming to shut Santa down, forever. Ultimately, Fred pitches in to save Christmas and help his friends besides.This is a funny, clean, holiday movie. Ho, Ho, Ho!"
3,worth it for Vince Vaughn,"Its funny, it has some great Vince Vaughn-isms..its not a great movie, but we laughed and I think Vince is quite funny."
4,"Kinda fun, not awful at all","i have to say, i'm surprised by the just awful reviews this movie got.i'm not a film critic, by any stretch, but i think that this is the perfect example of people expecting too much from a film.this is a fun, family style, christmas movie with enough humor for the adults to have a good time, too. i enjoyed all the actors, by and large, and thought they were having a good time, which maybe was what helped me enjoy it so much. i mean, how can you not like vince vaughn's smarmy bulls***??? ok, i know a lot of people who don't - but then you're not gonna like it anyway! if you do like vaughn, this is him but PG style.if you're going in expecting It's a Wonderful Life, you're going to be disappointed. if you go in hoping it's better than Saving Christmas, you'll be stoked, cos it is."
3,Not 16:9 aspect - Black bars top and bottom/ 2:4:1,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed this movie enough to buy it in Blu-Ray, but I am not happy that I spent the extra money to get a Blu-Ray movie advertised as 16:9 that actually only plays on my HD TV/Sony Blu-Ray with black bars top and bottom. I thought perhaps there would be a video setting I could change, but not matter what is changed on the player, it is the same black bar top and bottom. This is the last time I buy a Blu-Ray movie from Amazon because I will have no way to tell what aspect I am getting. I will stay with the cheaper DVD widescreen format that actually fills the screen."
3,Broken inside disk holder,The inside case that holds the BlueRay movie was broken. So the holder bangs around freely inside the case. Going to try and get a replacement case.
3,not real funny,this movie was ok it wasn't as funny as i thought it was going to bebut my dughter likes it
3,"Decent Christmas flick, but terrible Blu-Ray transfer","Fred Claus is a fun Christmas movie, nothing to compete with A Christmas Story or The Polar Express, but a solid movie for the whole family to enjoy.The problem is with the Blu-Ray version.............it's a terrible transfer. Multiply the effects of that poor transfer by viewing it on a 60 inch 1080P plasma tv and you'll see the grainy images in all their glory. The color is great, but the grainy images ruin what could have been a great Blu-Ray."
3,Okay,"This is by no means a terrible movie, but you can enjoy it if you don't take it *too* seriously. Fred is the older brother of Nick (who later becomes Santa Claus) In this story, those who achieve sainthood attain immortality for themselves, siblings, spouses, and parents, so Fred Claus has survived to this day as a repo man.Yeah, that whole sainthood/immortality thing didn't make sense to me, but I still enjoyed many parts of this film. Fred has many issues, but deep down inside he's not a terrible man, and his rivalry with Nick started with well-intentioned mistakes from his brother. The ending is a bit sappy and cliche, but it's not horrible. Just don't hold your expectations *too* high, and this is a movie you can enjoy."
1,Donizetti Dulled,"It is always a privledge to an opera its original language and in this case, the libretto is not censured like the Italian version is, but unfortunately the performance is lackluster. Most unfavorable is the work of Kasarova. Her coloratura is heavy handed. Generally speaking the soloists sound under nourished. I'll keep my Italian versions in my collection."
2,They better make another one...,"I bought this game pretty much only for the online capabilities,When it was brought home i was VASTLY dissapointed. The multiplayer didnt work for me nor most of the other people playing, It suffers severe lag and load times, and it didnt seem quite finished. I, myself, never made it to a Multiplayer game, so I wouldnt recomend buying this game to play with your friends.The addition of new units and civs was a nice touch but thats the only thing keeping this at 2 stars."
3,A good upgrad for Civ that is now obsolete,"This expansion mainly adds network play to Civ III, but now that Civ IV is out, it is now obsolete. The only reason to buy this instead of Civ IV is if your system is too slow or lacks the graphics support to play Civ IV, which is a huge improvement over Civ III."
1,"If it's not broke, don't fix it.","I have been a Civ fan since the very beginning with version 1. Civ II was a great improvment over the first, particularly in graphics, and game speed. I was greatly anticipating Civ III, and have never been as satisfied with that version as Civ II. I won't even consider this expansion pack, as Civ III sits on the shelf collecting dust, while Civ II is played all the time."
1,who are these people who write a review?,"How can somebody write a review of a game and give it stars when they haven't even seen it??? If you absolutely HAVE to write something on a computer, and don't know what else to do, DON'T REVIEW SOMETHING! Instead, write a letter to your grandma. She misses you.Sheesh.And Amazon: if you delete this one, you have to delete the previous one."
1,What a rip-off,"Only the slugs at Apolyton could manage to get people to pay [to much money] for a single computer game. Why wasn't CivIII multiplayer from the start like CivII? Easy. It wasn't multiplayer because they wanted to make saps pay [even more money] in order to get the ""play the world"" expansion![Not considered an Exspansion]Avoid this product like the plague and buy CivII instead."
3,I REALY LAKE CIVILAZETION GAMES,"MY FAST TIME TO PALY GAME IT WAS 2001 IN COUNTER STRIKESO I PALY CIVILAZION 3 AND FINISH BUT MY CDGAME =LOST WITH SOME FREANDS SO I REALY STEEK LAKE AND ASK,"
1,The worst add-on I ever bought. Waste at any price.,"I felt ripped-off. I love Civ III, but this add-on is total trash. Nothing to it. It is only good for their pocket books, I was very let down that this trash was put on the market. It is not worth even a dime!!! Wyatt Kaldenberg"
2,Pass Up Play the World,"I have been a Civ III player for ages and love the game. However PTW is just plain bad. It offers a handful of new units, races, and some improved graphics. It also runs much much slower than the original CIV III, crashes almost constantly, and lets not even discuss the uselessness of the multiplayer interfaces. I've downloaded the newest patch for PTW and that didn't fix any of the above issues. My advice is to play the original and pass up PTW until it works. Which won't be anytime soon."
1,REDEFINES MULTIPLAYER FUN as...no fun at all!,"To be brief, the additions (to civs, units, techs, structures, interface and editing features) are generally welcome, but in an ... expansion called the Play the World the multiplayer is the key to its value - and in this case next to worthless.With tweaking and patience you can get multiplayer to work, but so slowly that if I had an ant farm on my desk it would surely breed and expand more speedily than my multiplayer civ. I cannot say the computer crawls along in multiplayer, for that would imply continuous visible movement. Its more like trying to follow the conversation of a stuttering narcoleptic napping between each syllable. A pity, really, for Civ 3 is a fun game and it would be thrilling to clash with a truly sentient other (read: a friend you'd love to whoop)."
3,SLOW,"I Like playing some of the senarios with 31 AI players on hudge maps 250 x 250. But there is one problem even with my fairly up to date cumputer, 1.6GHz and 512MB of Ram. The game is slow so slow I cant stand to play it. Even when I play with only 8 AI players after 3 or 4 hours the AI players moves take up a minute or so between turns. This ends the game for me. I have never played online, but the game speed cant be any better."
5,this game rocks,you will relly like this game if you liked civilization 3 the frist version the new wonders rock.Plus the new unit rocks i will not tell you what it is so you will have to buy the game your self
1,Question Regarding Multiplayer,"I've read many of the reviews here detailing the laundry list of problems with the multiplayer game. I am wondering (and would like to hear from people regarding) whether the ""hotseat"" multiplayer, which I think is just played on one computer by multiple people, has the same laundry list of problems as the multiplayer played over the internet with strangers. I'm considering buying PTW just for the ability to play multiplayer at home with others, but won't if people say it has all of the same problems. Any thoughts?"
2,Adding things that should have been there before,"This expansion mostly adds features that should have been included in the first release. Every decent strategy game out there ships with multiplayer...you shouldn't charge more later for what should be included. A scenario editor also comes standard in many games these days. It can't be difficult to ship a scenario editor with the game. A few more civilizations? Wow. Great. Woohoo. Not worth the price. If this had the kind of innovative content that Fantastic Worlds had when it was released as an expansion to Civ2, I'd look foreward to it. Unfortunately, it looks to be simply what's required to finish an incomplete game."
3,Alexander,"First, I haven't played the expansion yet. But I have ordered it. This is to clear up some misinformation. The original reviewer says that Civ was never multiplayer. In this he is incorrect. A version came out as a multiplayer game called Civnet running on Windows 3.1.As for CivIII? It is great. The expansion looks interesting. I look forward to playing."
3,Usefull but expensive.,"I wrote a review of this pak a few months ago, and was a bit overwhelmed by the inability of the publishers to get the multi-play portion working.Now thats it a few months later, I have managed to cough up 2 more stars, as i really like the extra civs. Online play is better, but it's still a slow playing game, so elimination seems to be the only choice of play unless you are sick with mono and have a spare 48hrs to play.I've been playing civ3 relgiously now for allmost 2 years and still think it's the greatest game of all time, but I think 'Atari' (wutever) hyped it up to be sound better than what we got."
5,The best Civilization yet,"This expansion pack includes everything I've ever wanted in Civilization III. It adds new civilizations and new maps! You can set your maps to be historically correct to see what and how your favorite civilizations mastered their terrain and their neighbors. It adds new techonologies, wonders, units, everything. You cant play Civilization III without first buying this expansion pack because I can hardly imagine my playing experience without it."
1,This Game is Awful ( minus 5 stars),"Simply put this Expansion pack doesn't work. ""Multiplayer"" is totally unplayable. Lag times are terrible. Not to mention the ""crashes"", ""drops"", etc. I have yet to talk to one person that has totally played a reasonable online game.The extra features - most of which can be found for free, or should have been made availalbe for free.Keep in mind there was a ""Patch"" for this game before the game even was released. One professional reviewer called it ""an Unneccesary Add On""Take my advice - unless you can purchase this for about..., spend your money on something worthwhile. I've already sent mine back.Thanks for your time."
1,"Civ 3 Play the World is an unstable, laggy, bugfest","Absoluety abysmal code. The game does not work - the lag is incredible even with my cable modem and the game is so unstable I've not been able to ""play"" for more than 15 minutes without a crash. It is the worst bugfest I've ever seen. If you read this review and don't believe me, check the online gaming websites. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Protectors of Klairn, by Erin Elders was innovative and refreshing. She paints a picture of a world that lives and breathes and you feel like you are right there with Iona, the main character. Even through the last pages, the story kept me going. I heartily reccomend this for science fiction and fantasy lovers of all ages. I can't wait to read the next one."
2,Probably the weakest in the Key to Time series,"Although it gets off to a good start, Androids of Tara just never really comes together. The story is tried and tested - no originality here. It's just a typical person X wants to become king, but person Y is already king, and so hatch a giant, convoluted plot to make person X king. Romana spends most of the time either captured, or reciting her lines often consisting of silly questions, or ""explain the plot to the audience"" comments.To be fair, theres some well played out scenes, and some good one-liners by Tom Baker. Humour is there, and you get the impression the story isn't taking itself too seriously. The problem is, by the start of Episode 3, you'll probably wish it was all over.Two and a half stars for Androids of Tara."
5,Smoke and Mirrors,"I'll confess I'm writing this review from memory (the tape has not arrived yet), but I can say I recall this as one of my favorite episodes starring Tom Baker. The mysterious robot murder-mystery is quite spooky, and the robot masks are great. Really groovy, so check it out."
3,"""Would you mind not standing on my chest? My hat's on fire!""","Landing on the planet Tara, Romana believes that she can find the fourth segment of the Key to Time without getting involved with the locals. She couldn't be more wrong. ""Androids..."", with many Graham Williams' Who stories, is very cheap looking. The Taran beast in the opening doesn't help. But Fisher's story is so charming, and filled with great characters, such as the Count, that you almost forget about the silly acting, and lazy direction. Mary Tamm seems a little relaxed in her acting(especially as the Princess). There is loads of humor. The swordfight at the end of episode 4 is a little long winded, but enjoyable at the same time. At least we don't have a story where the villian wants to take over or destroy the universe, a typical ""Prisoner of Zenda"" story, incorporated in the Doctor Who universe."
3,Obligitory elements held together by witty dialogue ...,"...true, and rather indicative of Douglas Adam's script editing period. However, this episode like all of Adam's run were very very entertaining because he atleast chose the right elements and the dialogue was so well written that everything else could be forgiven. The sword fight in the end is one of the best ever done on film because of all the force and impact of each thrust and perry and by the end they are tossing barrels at each other and falling down stairs. Over all, 'Androids of Tara' may not be the height of Doctor Who's brilliance, but this fairy tale android story won't fail to continue entertaining."
5,Wonderful DVD,"My husband and I are big fans of the Gaither Homecoming DVD's. The DVD, Majesty, is becoming one of our favorites! We love the music and the artists are so sincere in their performances. The video gives a feeling of being on the cruise ship and seeing some pretty scenery."
5,Love it,"I bought this DVD for my mom as a special comfort gift. (My dad passed away recently.) As always, the Gaither's music goes straight to the heart and lifts you up. She loved it and found great comfort in the wonderful hymns. The scenery, the music, the jokes, all make for a lovely family DVD. One you can watch and enjoy over and over again."
5,the gaithers,Just love the Gaithers music. good dvd. .I highly recommend this product. Got what i ordered. Service was fast and I like the no hassel ordering process.
5,one of a kind,"Trying to describe Dick Katz is difficult. A modernist-traditionalist. A light, nuanced touch, and a lot of wild ideas. This album includes a quite a few standards, but not like you've ever heard them before. ""Limehouse Blues,"" for example, starts with a medium slow funky beat, on which he overlays harmonies and ""oriental scales"" derived from a Debussy ""Prelude."" Riley and LaSpina are extremely compatible partners. I can't imagine anyone who enjoys jazz piano trios not loving this album. Also a lovely solo version of ""Star Crossed Lovers."" Very nice Van Gelder recording."
5,Great Book,"""I was totally captivated by Pablo's book! With each chapter I felt he had opened his heart and let his reader's reach deep within his very soul. His love for God and mankind should inspire us all to search our own heart's for the love and compassion we have within ourselves to embrace each day with the love for a new tomorrow."" Jan Tinsley (GA)"
5,Wonderful stuff...for details see my brother's review below,"Here's a great bargain and performances to cherish. Each sonata is formally perfect, and it is a treat listening to an early effort, followed by one of the late works. Or, listen to the beauty in A minor, followed by the masterpiece in B flat. Mixed and matched or in sequence, or..., this is wonderful music. DG's package doesn't beat up on your wallet. Enjoy!"
5,"Mozart, pure & simple","This is my favorite set of Mozart piano sonatas, next to the Mitsuko Uchida collection from Philips. Eschenbach's performance is unadorned by needless trivialities, revealing a deep reverence for Mozart' score. Instead of taking liberties with the music, Eschenbach provides a pleasurable listening experience that can be relied upon again & again. Both his playing & the DG sound are impeccable, making this set of Mozart piano sonatas a thoroughly worthwhile acqusition."
5,Mozart through Eschenbach,"Totally agree with reviewer who chose this wonderous playing over all interpreters. Eschenbach has exquiste taste,judgement, instinct and unerring musicianship. Sounds like Mozart,don't it!!"
5,All that I expected,This is wonderful music and Christoph Eschenbach does a fantastic job with his interpretation. The box is cardboard with paper sleeves but don't let that deter you.
5,Pure Mozart,"There are a host of detailed and exhaustive reviews of this set of Mozart piano sonatas by Christoph Eschenbach, so much so that just about anything I might add could come off as plagiarism. So, let me just say that while you might find other performances of individual sonatas that are superior to what you'll find in this release is a comprehensive set of renditions that concentrate on the music rather than the personality of the keyboardist. Some may want it otherwise, and if so they may wish to go elsewhere. To get a clear perspective on Mozart's cumulative output in this realm, I don't know that there's anything better. The discs come in paper sleeves which are contained in a pasteboard box, with a booklet that includes an essay on Mozart's piano sonatas plus a smaller essay on Eschenbach's recordings. Recommended."
5,very specialized topic,"Joe has written a book about multivariate dependencies. This is really a side topic to multivariate analysis which deals with concepts of dependence among variables. These dependencies lead to probability inequalities. This includes concepts like association, total positivity and majorization. These topics are important at times in proving statistical theorems particularly with regard to asymptotic theory. But if you do not specialize in such things you may not find it very interesting or useful. The new book by Marshall and Olkin deals with these methods in determining properties of lifetime distributions. Their earlier book on majorization is a classic and gives more comprehensive coverage of probability inequalities for multivariate data."
2,Legally Irrelevant Facts Abound,"The Walker case tends to blur the vision of the American public, prompting us to rely more on our gut than our brains in formulating an opinion. The facts themselves really are not very sexy. The Indictment itself shows that far from dedicating himself to ""killing Americans"", as the Attorney General has alleged, Walker expressly refused the offer to participate in terror operations against the United States. It's there in Count 1, paragraph 14.All Walker did was receive training to fight the Northern Alliance. He then went to the front to fight this group of unsavory warlords. That's it. Nothing more. Hardly grounds for the lynch mob mentality that has swept the nation.The Indictment and many sensible articles on the case can be found [on the web]..."
1,Pseudo-psychology and bigotry offered at pop history,"The thesis is that John Walker Lindh became a jihadist is because he was a self-hating homosexual. Astonishing. The Taliban didn't recruit a lot of gays, that I know of. The author also says that 50% of RC Clergy are gay and that the Middle Ages burned witches because gays hate women. It says some equally ridiculous things about Jews, Christians, Muslims-- and the whole thing is a rant and worthless to someonelooking to understand the extremist mind. I have found what I was looking for in Eric Hoffer's 60's manifesto, The True Believer. This book is truly awful. I often sell used books to Powell's in Portland, but this book I intend to toss in the trash."
1,Repetitious pop psychology,"This book was disappointing. It did answer my basic questions about Lindh's childhood years, adolescence, and joining with Islamic extremists. The link between Lindh's political leanings and his alleged repressed homosexuality is intriguing. But do the authors have to repeat things over and over? The writing is amateurish. And what's the deal with Chapter 7, with the authors' diatribe against homosexuality and the American Psychological Association? This is certainly not a scholarly book, and is even questionable for an audience of laymen."
1,Waste of Time,"If you are really interested in learning about the facts surrounding the story of John Walker Lindh, this is not the book for you. There is nothing scholarly about this book. It is completely without journalistic integrity. It reads like a trashy tabloid magazine rather than a serious piece of literature on a serious subject. After nearly a chaper-long diatribe speculating that Lindh may have been a closeted homosexual, I couldn't take anymore and had to stop reading. If you are really interested in reading about the story of John Walker Lindh, I would recommend the book ""My Heart Became Attached"" by Mark Kukis instead of this book. Don't waste your time or your money on this book."
3,Question up on question!,"It raised questions about his parents. Why didn't they draw the lines? If I would be a Mom, I'd never let my Teenage- kid study in another Country but USA, especially not without a Highschool-diploma. And is he now gay or not? If he would be, why did he write an E- Mail to his Mom about Family-life in Yemen and that he wants to build a house there and get married ( FOXNEWS ).And why did he write to his Parents ""... I'm in safe hands now. ""? (around Dec., after his capture)I hoped this book would answer questions about this case, instead it raised even more."
2,most disappointing,"It has been a long time since I picked up a book that I found thoroughly useless. I don't enjoy giving a bad review, but I'd also hate for another user to waste their money on this book. This is an excellent example of how you should NOT judge a book by the cover (The cover is beautiful... but the content just doesn't live up to it.)If you'd like to know 27 different ways to take a bath, or 364 ways to use lavendar, read this book- otherwise avoid it. I don't know about you, but I don't need to buy a book to remind me to hug someone on November 15. Not only was the book just useless- I found grammatical errors!The book is a pale imitation of a Martha Stewart ""How To"" book. If I had not received it as a gift I would return it immediately."
3,Movie Stars and Presidents,"I thought this book was much to focused on ""major"" events. After the first couple of chapters I really felt that the book was focused on setting up elaborate events for VIP's. If you have a very high budget and need to entertain celebrities, then this book will be helpful."
4,Great read and reference for any type of event planner.,"Even a seasoned event planner will enjoy the insights that Judy helps to reveal in her book. It is well layed out, even to the point of leading off with location first, which every event planner knows is the number one step in planning. The steps and points of looking for a location,includes detailed information on what to consider when looking. I particulary like the fact Judy includes using her website, which offers additional advice and insight based on her own experinces. I was hoping to read more regarding contracts but overall the book is A+."
1,Season 3,I have season 1 and 2 with Elizabeth Michell as principal actress and season 3 is with other actors without any warning by amazon.
3,V Final Battle Poor Audio Quality,Good movie altho the DVD poor quality of the recording has much to be desired only one disk had audio on our Sony DVD recorder. I had to view it our computer Dvd Recorder to hear the sound.Did not check to see if it work on our older panasonic playerI notice Diana escaped in a shuttle leaving an opening for a sequel.
3,BAD DVD FORMAT GOOD SERIES,"I always hate it when companies feel the need to make double sided discs in box sets and with it also being in the second most difficult package I have ever had to remove the DVD it did not help. But putting nothing on the backside of disc 2 that was the worst thing.I love this mini-series. I was eleven when it ran for the first time. Not having Cable here, and only recently getting Satellite, I have not seen this since then. It is still my favorite science fiction mini. I only gave it 3 stars because of the poor design of the package.I would have much rather have had the whole movie crammed onto two one sided disks and have episode two cut in the middle than to have it the way it was designed.Do not let this stop you from watching this though it is a wonderful series.Also make sure you catch the new movie Signs I think they tie together nicely."
2,Not Like I Remembered........,"If you're even bothering to read these customer reviews, chances are you plan on buying this set no mattter what anyone says. I admit, nostalgia colored V and V:The Final Battle all sorts of wonderful colors in my mind, but I'm sad to say that The Final Battle doesnt quite stand the test of time. There is a serious drop in writing quality in THe Final Battle when comparing it to the Original Series. All of the timeless themes have been watered down until V: The Final Battle resembles a soap opera more than an Outstanding Piece of Science Fiction. The action is Saturday Morning Serial-like and the major plot points feel contrived at times. After all these years, V: The Original Miniseries still hit home with the themes of Loss, Love, and Rebirth associated with people going to war. These themes are traded for Action and 'Dallas' style Drama in V: The Final Battle. Without the depth of the themes portrayed in V, this Set just resembles a tired 80's mini series."
2,Great 2 DVD set of this classic. Horrible packaging!!,"I was really looking forward to watching the first DVD in the set. When I tried to take it out, I noticed that it was fastened so tight in the case that I broke the DVD in half trying to get it out. I followed the instructions and pressed the center of the holding tab, no budge. The disc was simply not going to come out. I want to warn future buyers of this set to be very carefull when you remove the discs. They may not come out that easy. I was carefull when I was removing mine and it did not make a difference! I have several DVD's in my collection, and this has to be the worst packaging I have ever seen! I guess they don't want you to be able to take the discs out! Anyways, I am going to have to get mine replaced. Don't let this happen to you!"
4,Great Sci-Fi.,"Great Sci-Fi movie. Some of the acting lacked the quality needed by the story. The high-tech ""gagets"" were okay, but"
5,Best movie from its time,I loved the V movie and mini series as a kid. It is still fun to watch and see the message that was being put out without being direct now.
5,i really love this,This second V mini series wasn't quite up to the standards of the first V and yet it was still a helluva lotta fun. Loved it. Popping it into the DVD player is always a blast! Sure I know it's not highbrow but hell it's FUN. Just have fun watchin' space lizards get their butts kicked by Marc Singer. Works for me!
4,Great Sci-Fi...Right up there with Star Wars !!,"At the time of the original airing on TV, I was only about 10 years old. I loved it!! Now, years later, I find that it still holds the initial appeal. The storyline is terrific as well as the special effects...very advanced for a TV miniseries in the early 80's. If you are a sci-fi fan, then this is a ""can't miss"". After trying for years to find this selection on video, I am pleased that THE FINAL BATTLE, and the original miniseries are on video. Also, the TV SERIES is available through Columbia House Video. If you can get your hands on these, I assure that you will not be sorry."
4,Excellent Sci-Fi,"Let me address the special effects. Yes, NBC went with a tighter budget and unfortunately some of the special effects suffered, but just the ""air and space"" ones. The special effects on the ground were done very well.But to put it in perspective look at Superman: The Movie. Any scene where he was flying around was 2nd rate at best. And we're talking a major motion picture with a much larger budget.Loved Marc Singer in both mini-series. Not sure why they had him go all David Hasselhoff in many of the scenes. Perhaps it was just to attract female fans. So I have no problem with that. Just thought it was amusing.As for the ending. It too suffered because of budget cuts. Some genius at NBC should have shelled out a few more bucks, especially considering the show's high ratings.I was disappointed with it as a young teen and I'm disappointed with it now. Overall, a great series though."
5,A science fiction epic,"I concur with the majority of the prior ratings. I own both V and V The Final Battle. When the original series aired on TV in 1984 (I believe it was a marathon 4 nights), the series consisted of not only V but also V The Final Battle. For those of you that remember the original mini series, you need to buy both CDs to see it as you remember it (it's still just as great as it was almost 20 years ago)"
4,not the final battle,"A classic from the 80's,but only for die hard fans.The disks are a little hard to take out, so my advise is be very careful(lift the dvd from the top only)The only problem is that it is not the final battle cos' there are still 19 episodes that have not been released on dvd or vhs(come on warner bros. do us a favour and release the real final battle)The quality of the dvd's are very good.If you have the first dvd do yourself a favour and get this one as well."
1,Schlock.,"This is what happens when a TV network gets hold of a halfway decent science fiction idea. Too much corporate meddling. The basic premise - that 50 gigantic flying saucers that appear in the skies over major cities all over the world and are instantly accepted as friendly - was ludicrous. The secret reason they came - MARS WANTS YOUR WATER - was stupid beyond belief. You want water? Fly out to the Oort Cloud surrounding your own solar system and mine it by the ice-asteroid load.The humans and aliens were cartoonish characatures, unworthy of a saturday morning cartoon. The most impressive ""special effect"" they came up with was an Alien Babe (tm) gulping down a live rat. And the Deuz Ex Machina ending to the series was awful. The only thing worse than this mini-series was the pathetic TV series they tried to follow it up with."
4,Good fun entertainment,"After watching all of the original mini series, I had to watch the final battle. It was a fitting end for those reptiles. Actually, plenty of folk today think our world is already full of these aliens acting as some of our leaders. I'm thinking they are right. Was a fun watch without all the blood and guts. Reptilians beware, there are some of us on to you."
4,Alien Appetite,"I remember seeing V back in the 80's. I thought that the premise was excellent. At that time we were all caught up with Star Wars, ET, Star Trek and more. The Final Battle brings all of the characters together. There is a lot of action here. I liked it better than the series. Special effects by todays standards is bad. But for the 80's it was fine. Enjoyed the story because it can take place anywhere and at any time. I WOULD DEFINATLY BUY IT."
4,A Blast from the past,"I brought V. once I realize that amazon had it. When it first came out I was only able to see the mini series. I had to work nights and didn't get to see any of the series. The series added a new light to why i adore sci-fi. V reminded me of how far we've come with special effects. Not to give away a lot of the plot. But,(sike no butts.) Marc Singer has always been one of my favorite actors(Breasmaster)and loved what he did in this movie. Many of the scenes were so far from being realistic that it still grabbed your attention. Lizard Aliens that's not too far of a stretch. Diana now that's a woman/lizard out to get what she wants. I'm almost done with the series. So far I'm impressed"
4,"More action, less brains than the original","I would probably give this 3 1/2 stars if I could, but since the system only works with whole stars, I'll give it 4. When I was a kid, I prefered ""The Final Battle"" to the original, but now that I'm older, the flaws in this follow-up are more evident. Series creator Kenneth Johnson left midway through the development, and I would love to read his original script (Ham Tyler was in a wheelchair in his original version, and the ending was much different).Missing from ""The Final Battle"" is the entire anti-scientist sub-plot of the original mini-series. It has more action than the original, but also less depth. It's less of an alegory for Nazi Germany/facism, and more of a straight-forward action piece.Michael Ironside's ""Ham Tyler"" character is a standout, but the mini-series ending is ridiculous. A real ""Deus Ex Machina"".Bottom line: entertaining, even with its flaws. Recommended, but moreso the original."
3,It only works because Johnson did not do it.,"This was the real finish of the V saga. Ignore the TV show and Johnson's new book, and just be satisfied with the two mini-series."
4,I recommend that you read the other reviews..,"However, noone has commented on one interesting fact..Theres a episode MISSING!The orginal miniseries is 10 hours long.. theres 2 hours missing.. and the part where they attack the processing plant is ""too soon"".. unfortunately, I don't remember whats missing.. but it seems that it belongs before the first ep presented on this DVD set!"
1,Contemporary wedding video and photo from 1994,"As someone who was recently married and a New York wedding video provider at Iris Cinema (www.iriscinema.com), I can speak from both sides. You're better off searching the Web for information than reading through this material. It is dated and doesn't cover the options that people are offering in the wedding video and wedding photography markets. It may have been current when it was published in 1994, but it certainly won't be of much use now."
5,Excellent basic text for undergraduate ed/phil courses.,"I teach an entry-level undergraduate course in educational philosophy. My first year students needed a basic text to structure the course, yet it was important to me that the students read WHAT the philosphers had to say rather than just reading ABOUT them. This volume enables the students to do just that -- it contains primary source material in the form of selected essays by leading philosphers, as well as providing general background on major philosophical schools. Ozmon and Craver also include a section for each major school of philosophy that specifcally addresses the aims of education, role of the teacher, and methods and curriculum."
4,Philosophical Foundations of Education,I bought this book for coursework. I may refer to it a couple of times in the course of a lifetime. Not a lot of fun but that's the topic. The authors do give you the heavy hitters and their branches of the philosophical tree. This is a pretty good source book.
5,Boyfriend LOVED it as a Christmas gift!,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He went nuts! He loves it. The picture quality is good, and has not been retouched, so it's exactly how you would remember seeing back when it was aired. I wish it wasn't so expensive, but somethings are just worth it! I recommend this set to any fan of Dr. Who that liked Tom Baker the best."
4,nice box set,they should have put it on fewer disks since dvd can hold more than the video tape and can store on both sides of a disk.Hopefully they will do that on the E-space trillogy it saves storage space.I only give it a 4 because they didn't take advantage of the abillity to store more of the stories in a smaller amount of space.
2,"Dr Who is GREAT , but Brit TV is SLOOOOW","I just bought this set based upon fond memories of 20 years ago. Technically it is GREAT. Great color & sound. I love those cute young Brit women who are 50 now! Stories are good too. BUT I forgot how boring these stories can be. If the Doc is onscreen, the action & dialog is good. If he isn't there, forget it! It just drags on & on. Wish I were a Time Lord to leap to the next scene. A typical 99 minute segment could easily be cut down to 60 minutes or less with no loss in content.I would not buy this again."
5,The Doctor from the States,"This is been one of my best purchase from United States. Impossible to find elsewhere, the season of the Key to Time can't be missed by any Doctor Who fan, by any Douglas Adams fan (the second episode of the season sees Doctor Adams leave for a while his labour of love, Hitchhicker Guide to the Galaxy, to accomplish his duty for the other ""Doctor""), by any english television fan (a lot of surprises about the other actors in the series all around!!!). Wish someday the next season will come out, when Douglas Adams where script editor, but in the meanwhile, this box is providing me as much fun as I could expect. though I think that the best Doctor Who period is still the one of the Hinchcliff's production, this season shows still enough care and professionality by the actors, the writers, the producers and all the television workers. Need to know more? Oh, come on, just buy it!"
4,More hours of pleasure than I can calculate,"The Dvd's have commentary, some with Tom Baker! That is endless enjoyment. Then you have the text commentary, fanstastic. The only thing I find missing is easter eggs. :( I hope they remember when comming out with future dvd's what fun those are to have."
4,Fine Dr Who but often silly,"The earlier Dr Who season produced by Philip Hinchliffe used classic Gothic horror interspersed with sly humor. Here Graham Williams and Douglas Adams bring the humor to the fore front and while witty especially with Adams' own ""The Pirate Planet"" it often leaves Dr. Who fans cold. Mary Tamm is a knockout and the jokes come fast and furious. For newcomers to Dr. Who via the new season this is a fine introduction to the real show."
5,An Inspiring Book,"I read this book about 1982. I used to work the night shift at a hospital and on Sunday mornings, I recall listening to a Sunday Morning NPR talk show. One morning, Howard Cosel interviewed the author of Righteous Gentile. I was completely fascinated by this story that I had never heard. Howard was masterful in his interview and I was so taken that I immediately purchased the book and read it. It is riveting and I could not put it down until I had consumed it all. I am always in amazed wonderment at ordinary people who perform extraordinary acts under dire conditions. Wallenberg was such a man. The story is, of course, a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, as Wallenberg disappears into the Russian Gulag. I irony of his imprisonment in the Gulag after having saved so many Jews from their fate in the Holocost. It is one of those books that is uplifting because it reminds us of both the good and evil that humans are capable of."
1,This toy will break,Our Splash Ring Toss toy was a gift. It fell apart on the first use within two minutes. We were careful not to jump on it. The hole on the seam is large and beyond repair. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY.
1,Disappointed,"Although this was loads of fun for my 2 year old daughter, it burst through the seam with the water pressure after just two uses. This seems particularly annoying because we were using a small hose, and the water pressure was weak to start. Very cheaply made, and I am returning it."
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased this DVD as well as the Cartoon Classics as a gift. I was a bit embarrassed by the quality. It looks like it was restored by an amateur. You can see the image of a rectangle around the characters in some of the cartoon clips. I assume this is due to the restoration process. Also, I don't like how Starling Films incorporates their own titles into each cartoon. It doesn't make it very classic. I am now looking to purchase the Looney Tunes Collection DVD. The only thing that I do enjoy about this DVD is the nostalgia effect. It brings back fond memories of Saturday mornings watching cartoons."
4,Timeless Cartoons,"I bought this DVD for ""Fraidy Cat (aka, ""The Animals Squeak"")"" featuring the characters of Porky Pig and ""Kansas City Kitty."" On another collection (Cartoon Classics, Vol. 2 - I believe), the sound track is off five seconds on the entire DVD - just terrible!! On the ""Timeless Cartoons"" DVD, the sound track is right on time - Four stars (and the price is right, too!!)"
4,A vital book for investors,"The percentage of people investing in the stock market is at an historical high, yet few people understand that the markets rise and fall in definite patterns. These patterns are explained by Dow Theory, devised by Charles H. Dow who was the founder of the still famous Dow averages. The leading Dow Theory practitioner of today is Richard Russell (...). Richard Russell wrote this little book in 1961 about the stock market from 1958-1960. His commentary about this period in stock market history is directly applicable to today's stock market situation. This book teaches the difference between a bull and bear market, proven over a century of stock market statistics."
5,An awesome resource to have,"I completely love this book. When I was out of ideas for the children I work for I would turn to this book and pick an activity out of it, maybe change a few things here and there, and we would have fun. This book has also helped with my class assignments. I love it!!"
3,It's okay,"I have this book which I almost threw away today because there is no reference on each 'play' as to if it is to be sung or not. So, unless you know all about 300+ of these mini plays, don't expect to get too much out of it. It is cute but I wish there was something that would give a music line or a cd with this book."
5,Check this out!!,"Being a hardcore U2 fan myself, I was immediately drawn to Marc when I learned of his great admiration for them. With his debut album, Limited Lifetime Guarantee, Marc Copely showcases his enormous talent both musically and lyrically. Once a guitar teacher, he now shows his intense passion on the album with his incredible playing, and writes words that form such vivid imagery. He is a truely talented musician with qualities that are rare to find these days."
5,Live Worship from Rebecca St. James!!,"""Live Worship-Blessed Be Your Name"" is the very first live CD to be released from Christian music's long-time favorite female vocalist Rebecca St. James.The focus of this CD is pure Praise and Worship music sung from the heart. Included are familiar Worship songs such as ""Let My Words Be Few"", ""Let My Words Be Few"", ""Above All"" and ""Here I Am To Worship"" as well as the originals ""Lamb Of God"", ""Quiet You with my Love"" and the brand new ""I Adore You"".The CD also features a new studio track, a heartfelt take on the Maranatha classic ""The Power of Your Love"" and Rebecca's version of Darlene Zschech's Worship standard ""Shout to the Lord"" is included as a hidden bonus track.All in all, this is a fine album of live Worship music from a talented lady. It's worth every penny of its very low price. There isn't a bad piece of music on this one.Splendid!!!"
4,Great Worship Collection,"As with anything that Rebecca St. James does, this collection is excellent. She has a superb mix of worship songs on this live CD.In addition to the listed songs, there is a hidden track of 'Shout to the Lord' so don't stop the last song too soon. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lot of songs. I would have loved to have heard a few more. Excluding that mild problem, this is very good. I would recommend it."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"DVD'S WORKED FINE, BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN SECTION ON THE REEL WHERE DISKS DID NOT WORK I WAS UNABLE TO USE ABOUT 15 DISKSI STILL HAVE ABOUT 10 OF THESE LEFTAND MY COMPUTER WON'T RECOGNIZE THEM"
3,4 failures,"3 out of the first 6 disks I used reported disk failure during burning. Since then I've burned about 25 more with only 1 more burn failure (about the 16th or 17th disk). On about half the disks about halfway through the burn it would hang for a long time... like it was on the verge of failure, but barely made it through. This was on a very clean malware-free machine. 4.66ghz, with 4gb of ram, with no clutter running in the background. Never had a disk hang a in the middle of a burn before. Very time consuming when I needed to burn several disks in a hurry.No burn failures with any other brand I've used so far. Oh well, I got them real cheap when they were on sale."
1,pretty lame,"Very promising, but ultimately pretty lame. Alternating between seeming to criticize secret societies from an unspoken but implicit Catholic perspective, and then claiming that the Catholics are behind the Illuminati, Gardiner contradicts himself many times and furthermore, reveals his status as a total outsider by making straw man arguments against the Freemasons, who he seems to have very little actual knowledge of. Nice Ken Burns effects in iMovie though. A word of advice: If you want to understand secret societies, consider joining one instead of just making stuff up."
4,Consistent Gardiner,"Gardiner once again give a consistent, interesting, low key look into secret societies. He has no fear and seems to love to delve into the secret lives and histories of powerful groups. I found this DVD to be powerful, interesting and intelligent. You don't have to agree with everything Gardiner says to find this DVD entertaining."
3,Knights Templar to Nazis,"What is a ""secret society?"" Author and filmmaker Philip Gardiner uses a plethora of visual images and music to explore and explain the beginnings of secret societies. The rites and rituals performed and revered by such groups as Knights Templar, Nazis, Freemasons, and even one of the first secret societies, Christianity are looked at from a historical and contemporary perspective. Very interesting stuff!"
1,Poorly done,"This is one of the poorest produced documentaries I have ever seen. Better videos being done by 13 year old children on YouTube. Music irritating, no real documentary footage. Just dialogue, repeating bad images, and terrible music."
1,The worst ever!,"OMG, the worst ever! I thought it would be like the documentaries usually shown on the History Channel. There were no people, no interviews, no opposing views, no ""wow, I've never heard that!"" moments. Gardiner never appears on camera, and I almost needed captioning to hear him over the constant blaring music."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!,"This DVD is probably the worst DVD I have ever purchased. It is so awful that it is difficult to know where to begin with reasons one should not waste precious time or equally precious money on this appalling piece of exceptionally poor video production. Perhaps that is where it will serve the greatest good, as an educational example of how NOT to make a video.Mr. Gardiner certainly has made a silly, foolish video disaster of what should otherwise be a fascinating subject. If there was some way to give a negative star rating, this would be the lowest standard possible. I wish that there was some way to obtain a refund."
4,"A Gardiner ""Must See""...","If you are interested in Gardiner's other films on secret societies, codes, etc., this is a ""must see."" In this piece, he focuses on uncovering the dicussions and major concerns of secret societies such as the Free Masons, Kights Templar, Serpent Cults, and the Illuminati (whom I find fascinating). There are major links here that I never knew about. Learn why so much of this information has remained hidden and how it can benefit us in contemporary society."
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"IT'S BASICALLY THE AUTHOR READING FROM HIS BOOK WHILE PHOTOS, DIAGRAMS, IMAGES ARE FLASHED ON THE SCREEN. VERY LITTLE ACTUAL LIVE VIDEO RECORDED FOOTAGE. YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING THE AUDIO CD OF THE BOOK WITH THE SAME NAME. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY FOR ME. SO DISSAPOINTED."
2,Worth max $10 (including shipping),"I was disappointed with the content. I have other related DVD's as well, but this is the first one in which I was getting bored and waited for the end. I also get the smell that Gardiner try to make the assumption that ""Christianity"" is also a secret society. Watching this one did not really broaden my knowledge.The first one I got was completely faulty and Wholesale DVD America have send me another one free of charge. I wonder if the reproduction are really professional."
3,Secrets Revealed,"As someone who knew very little about secret societies, which I guess is a testament to their secretive status, I found this documentary to be quite an eye-opener. If you have ever remotely wondered about secret societies, their place in history, the men who belong to them and the things they do that prompt them to maintain their secrecy and mystery then you will definitely find this film educational. Conspiracy theorists as well will revel in Gardiner's insightful view into the world of secret societies."
3,Not So Secret Anymore!,"You always hear about ""secret societies"" and probably wonder what goes on behind closed doors. Is it strange rituals so odd that they must be hidden from the rest of the world, or simply exlusive ""clubs"" intended only for a chosen few? This one hour DVD by Philip Gardiner packs in a lot of information about secret societies and their history. It's like having a backstage pass to witness the goings on of the Freemasons and Illuminati. If you're thinking ""The Da Vinci Code"" then think again. Even those who think they may know a lot about these groups will be surprised at the evidence and information presented in this film. Even if you don't agree with everything Mr. Gardiner reveals, it's certainly interesting and he leaves no stone unturned."
1,Terrible!,"While he presented information on the subject, the ""music video"" style might have been OK for teens but I doubt if the subject would garner any interest from them. The constant zooming in and out every few seconds doesn't give a person any time to really see the pictures and the superimposing of another picture almost instantly is very distracting. While some of the present-time video is in color, a portion of it is in black and white, giving the impression the filming was done with a hidden video camera and without permission to photograph in those places. A narrator with a more penetrating voice would have been more effective in the sections with the singing music, although I believe most people would have been satisfied without it since they were concerned with the content and not with the singing. I don't recommend this at all."
5,AMAZING book!!,This book has influenced me substantially. It has effectively helped me to manage the little voice in my head and figure out where the voices are coming from. Thank you!
2,Look before you buy,Ok 1st of all I bought this book because there was nothing stated on the website saying it is used with refrence from the mormon Bible. Maybe I should know that Steven A Cramer is a mormon but I had no clue. So suprise when I start seing these odd Bible refrences such as helaman and nephi and mormoni I was very disapointed that nothing was stated before I bought this book so be careful. I am not geting into a dominational battle but it would have been nice to have known this before I spent my money on it I am sure it is a great book for those with the mormon faith.
2,OEM not O.E.M.,"OEM is a brand name, has nothing to do with original equipment. I bought this over bosch because I thought itwas O.E.M. the other thing is that it has aluminum contacts, not brass. It fit well and so far is working well"
3,Video,"Nothing new, but great for beginners. Does not have much individual training ideas I was looking for."
3,"Despite title, mostly Army patches","From the title and the description, I was expecting a comprehensive guide to patches from all service branches. In fact, this book is heavily weighted in favor of Army patches. There are no patches for individual ships, submarines, or aviation units (i.e., squadrons). If you are interested in such patches you must look elsewhere. The patches are clearly reproduced, but I would have appreciated more information on each patch: unless you are already familiar with an individual unit, it's difficult to determine when the patches were in use."
3,Good but not good enough,"Mostly Army patches which is what I collect, but the majority off the newer patches, are not included even though they were approved in the nineties??? What's up with that. But the book is more comprehensive than others I own."
5,Simply The Best Ever Recording of Beethoven String Quartets,"I grew up listening to many different recordings of this acclaimed Beethoven Cycle. I have admired Alban Berg Quartet (live EMI), Tokyo String Quartet and Guarneri Quartet recordings, but the warmth of the Amadeus Quartet sound in this recording and their interpretation is truly astonishing. I recommend this to anyone who really wants to understand the depth and complexity of possibly Beethoven best compositions."
1,$200 + labor = Cold air for 1 year,"Worked great for 1 year. Now it's weak, won't cool at idle with <200psi head pressure, @2500 rpm it goes up to 300 and gets cold. I am a DIYer but I follow proper service procedures including flushing components and pulling deep vacuum. Disappointed and will be choosing another brand in the likely case that the warranty will be denied."
2,"""It hasn't moved for fifteen minutes...""","""The Power of Kroll"" is very disappoiting. Stories such as this, are one of the reasons why some Who fans disliked the Graham Williams era of producing. It's also a shame this is a Robert Holmes story, who wrote ""The Ribos Operation"" at the opening of the season! Kroll, a giant mutated squid(with help from the Fifth Segment), is such a bad idea. Bad models and rotten CSO do little to give any kind of real threat(only laughs). And the swampies, well, if you don't have anything nice to say...! The acting is extremely lazy, even Phillip Madoc having a little trouble trying to swallow his lines. The Doctor and Romanna are the saving grace in this stinker. It is a shame that Holmes first script went on the air, why if he had rewritten it a day late, we might have had ""The Caves of Androzani"" or ""The Swamps of Delta Magna""!"
2,Move along. Nothing to see here.,"This really is something of a disaster, and is by far the worst story in the Key to Time Series. Green coloured men running around, random tentacles grabbing various cast members - it's all a bit duff. The story tries to put forward a commentary on the bad things that happen when a country/place is colonized and it's original inhabitants (read: native-americans in this story) are ousted. Problem is, it just doesn't work due to deficiencies in script, effects, acting (swampies don't act well), you name it.Overall, it was a poor choice for the penultimate key to time story, and you can't help but wonder whether, had they swapped the stones of blood and kroll around, it wouldn't have been so bad."
2,Were we watching the same thing?,"I would like to point out that a fan of any TV series does not have to adore every single episode of it.This story, for example, is a pretty limp attempt to do a 'King Kong'. The silly-looking natives are replaced by (arguably) even sillier-looking men in green paint and wooly hats, who chant 'Kroll' instead of 'Kong'. The characters are pretty wooden and virtually nothing seems to happen for most of the adventure.On the plus side, Tom Baker's Doctor is at his best and the whole thing is taken seriously, which is certainly a refreshing change in what is mainly a rather childish era of the series. But how can you take seriously a rubber monster battling a wobbly toy oil rig? The final episode could have been gripping but is just rendered laughable by special effects which are dire even by the standards of this series.This adventure might have been entertainingly bad if it wasn't so boring."
3,Green Guys Can't Dance,"The low point of the sixteenth season, with green guys who can't dance or even chant ""Kroll"" with an even beat, a dance that looks like it was choreographed by a seventh grade gym teacher, a silly model processing station and giant squid in a bathtub, the Doctor and Romana suddenly sprouting hip waders and goloshes, etc, etc. Yet, somehow it's still fun and will stay in my collection."
2,One of the worse Dr. Who's ever,This is one of the worse Dr. Who's ever. The special effects are horrible and the plot is questionable.
3,Essential for Key to Time Series...but not a great story.,"If you are collecting the six Doctor Who stories featuring the finding of the segments to the Key of Time then you will have to get this one, but the story is very dull and includes some really bad acting. However, Romana looks lovely. END"
3,"Hey, wait a minute! It's better than McCoy!","This story is worth buying if only for the witty dialogue. Tom Baker's brilliant portrayal of the Doctor makes up for whatever is lacking in production values, and that makes this episode very much worthwhile. The Swampies are a collective metaphor for any race of people that were removed from their native land and placed in reservations or used as slaves. I found it to be a fairly powerful moment when Ranquin the High Priest of the Swampies was destroyed by Kroll, the god upon whom his entire faith was based. And in the first episode, Tom Baker breaks off a reed near the water's edge and procedes to play the final movement to a Bach flute concerto on it!I'd rather watch ""The Power of Kroll"" than any of the miserable late 1980's episodes starring Sylvester McCoy."
3,Gross,"I ordered this thinking it would make me have more energy but it was too nasty to swallow, so i never used it. this stuff tastes horrible and good luck to you if you are going to make yourself drink it. Hold your nose!"
5,Great DVD for Tony Sweet's fan Club,This is a very helpful DVD for Tony Sweet's fans. He discusses how he shoot his amazing pictures. In DVD 1 he discusses how he takes pictures in the field and in DVD 2 He discusses about his pictures in studio. Both of them is full of valuable informations. I recommand the DVD for those who likes Tony Sweet's pictures.
2,Not for the beginner,"This was a big disappointment for me as a beginner. He was shown rushing around doing his craft, but never gave the details of what it is about!! He used slang and professional jargon which left me totally lost. This was a waste of my money as an amateur."
3,tool carrier,This tool bag was a gift for my husband and he ended up returning it. It wasn't exactly what he was looking for but well-made and a good quality for the price.
4,Good bag for the price,"I have now had 2 of these bags in the last 6 years. The original bag lasted just about 6 years before I managed to wear it out. I'm not easy with the bag, I pick it up however I can, and when I get to the job, I DROP it on the floor and the darn thing holds together time after time. The only reason I had to replace it was that I kept putting sheet metal shears, needle knose pliers, and dykes in the bag with the pointed ends down and over time, they made a hole in the bottom of the bag next to the side, same with the screwdrivers. This time the pointed ends are up and it seems to work better for me. The only week spot seems to be the shoulder strap rings. They pry open over time, I TIG'd the ends closed and no more problems.This bag is better than anything you will find at one of the box stores and big enough to get to heavy to carry if you really load it up. Good value and durability for the money."
4,Tool Bag,"Nice and roomy with plenty of pockets. Only problem I have is the handle was laid flat in shipping and it holds that position. Perhaps it will loosen up as it ""breaks in""."
4,*Now* I'm a fan...,"Apart from the moderate liking of ""Black Concert T-Shirt"" back in the mid 90's, I was never an overly big fan of Watershed. Occasionally they'd release a recording to local radio that was generally unimpressive, although never objectionable. But after hearing the surprisingly phenominal songs ""Can't Be Myself"" and ""Anniversary"" on the radio, I found myself getting this CD. And I'm glad I did. An amazing collection of indie rock (rather than ""Melodic hook filled power pop"" as described above) where every song is unique rather than being a rehash of the same song over and over. Not every song hits the mark, but nearly all of them do -- and it makes for a CD you'll be singing to in no time. Take it from someone who owns over 200 CD's (nearly all of which are small and indie bands) -- and therefore someone who's extremely critical about new music -- this is a CD to buy."
1,How the mighty have fallen,"I was taken by surprise when I saw Anaconda 3 in the tv listings as I had not heard of its being made. When I saw that it was to be making a Sc-Fi Channel debut, I knew to prepare for the worst. I suppose that the producers wanted to cash in on whatever brand value ""Anaconda"" has left as Sci-Fi has seen several movies with similar production values with Python, Python II , Boa, Boa vs. Python, Cobra vs Komodo, etcetera and could have just churned out another in its own misbegotten line. The other 2 Anaconda movies actually saw theatrical release, so obviously they have the look and feel of a ""real"" Hollywood movie. Anaconda 3 on the other hand, looks and feels cheap. Neither of the Anaconda predecessors were any Citizen Kane, but when you take the money out of them you get typical Sci-Fi Channel Movie of the week fare. Typical for the Sci-Fi channel is just plain bad."
2,Has about as much in common with Anaconda as Dino's Big Monkey movie did with King Kong,2 Stars because it's no worse than than most Sci-Fi Channel fare. That being said why some suit thought turning a giant snake movie into a slasher film was a good idea is beyond me.If only they'd spent one tenth of the blood and prosthesis budget on a decent CGI model of an Anaconda. For that matter if they were going to include those shots of real snakes they could have used some with Anacondas instead of Boa Constrictors and Corn Snakes.Guess snakes all look alike to the Ophidiophobic.
2,Anaconda vs. Hasselhoff,"A giant pregnant anaconda escapes from a research facility and a team of hunters are tasked with killing it before it can reproduce. It is a mysterious thing that some films can be complete garbage and yet kind of fun to watch, while other films may also be complete garbage but impossible to get through. This one manages to be fun without possessing any kind of real quality. Dare I give the credit to David Hasselhoff, who chews the scenery as the snake hunter Murdoch? Yes, I dare!"
1,AWFUL MOVIE,"TERRIBLE MOVIE!!! I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED! I love Anaconda 1 & 2 and dispite the reviews for Anaconda 3 I still purchased it. this is one time that I really should have listened to the reviews. Don't waste your money! DON""T DO IT!!!!! For the price of this dvd go purchase yourself a nice lunch or dinner."
1,Too Bloody,"My goodness, this was one of the worst movies I saw in a long time, so much so that I had to stop watching after I saw the very graphic, very greusome way in which the snake killed people. Very disgusting."
5,Classic - Must Have,Bought this landmark cook book for a friend who's a great cook/chef thinking it would be an historic add to her collection of great cookbooks - a conversation piece. Turns out it's as relevant today as it ever was - filled with great recipes and we use it often. And a bargain at that!
4,"My Shakespeare - Romeo & Juliet for a New Generation, with Baz Luhrmann (2006)","I stumbled across this version and absolutely fell in love with it. Usually, I don't watch much Shakespeare, but this behind-the-scenes of a Shakespearean production with amateurs was fascinating. It truly gave me hope not only for these young people from harsh backgrounds, but anyone who struggles with adverse life circumstances,(myself, included)! It was definitely worth the watching."
2,Disappointing.,"I found this book, along with it's sister title, to be tirelessly repetitive and over simplified. Most of these women (the great majority of whom are upper middle class New Yorkers) have very similar stories to tell, albeit in slightly different ways and with a few truly unique perspectives and experiences. Whether reporting on mothering girls or boys: expectations based on very old gender stereotypes that are reinforced by the old, inevitable nature argument. I was saddened that the majority of these accounts were not more imaginative or complex. Catherine Newman, among a few others, were the exceptions."
5,Absolutely Wonderful. Insightful,"Interesting the only negative review was from a male. I have a 14 mo. old son and these writers are spot on about so much! I feel like they are my feminist friends. Great tough insights, wonderful laughs too.Good work."
5,A new appreciation for my sons,Right away after reading an except from this book I knew it was for me. I could relate to the parts about women who saw themselves as mothers of daughters but never really thought about mothering sons.I find myself just appreciating all the good things that boys have to offer and relishing in them while reading this book. I am half way through it and have told many friends about it. I think if you have 2 boys or more it is a good read.
3,"Overall great essays, but some that are very hard to read","Overall, the stories are touching and are exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered this book. However, for those of you are sensitive, be careful - there are some hard essays to read in there about loss and danger to the mother - which being pregnant right now, I found difficult."
5,Great Perspective,"I've passed this book along to all of my friends who have sons. It is a super quick, light read with lots of humor and new ways of looking at things for those of us raising little men."
4,"works great, and simple too","The picture vission works great out of the box.The best thing is that it auto starts and plays whatever you have on the card, so it can be used in a kiosk or art piece etc.It only has rca out to a TV, I wish it had S-video or something that would work with a projector."
2,Worked great - for 2 days,"Very elegant and clear interface. Flexible selection of input memory cards. Works as advertized on any TV.However, after 2 days the image turned black & white and flickering on any normal tv. My LCD TV still managed to display the color image...Tech support was reachable and professional. Asked that I ship it back to them for repair or replacement. I really liked it, so am going to give it a try - instead of returning for refund."
3,Solid Product,"The only thing is that its the old version. Had this been conceived today it would be battery powered, be usb connectible to the computer, function as a card reader/writer and be much smaller. Its very slow if your images are not sized down to 600pixels (at its longest dimension). It is however functional! I use it in my photography business for basic image projection. I dont want to use the fancy stuff because it will actually slow down the process. My only wish was that I could hide images that have been shown during a presentation and play mp3's during the images projected.It does its job. Could be better, but it does its job."
2,Disappointing,"I love Andre Norton's books, especially the witch world series, however this one is disappointing. Very little contribution by Andre. The author tries to show the hero's experiences and thoughts and then shows the heroine's side. This causes a disruption in the flow of the story and increases the drag. Andre's books are ""magical""; this one isn't. Have noticed this problem whenever she would c0-write a book. I own all her books, but will be giving this one to the library."
5,Yodelling thoughts,"Having a large collection of ""Yodelling Songs"" this CD was a 'must have' for me. Although not modern day recordings the artists prove who the old time yodellers were. I have gained more songs and singers to my collection (apprx over 1000 in total now) This is a great CD for the yodelling fans and we await a volume ""2"". well done producers and keep finding more yodellers!"
2,Cabelas ultimate deer hunt,"I havnt played or seen any of the other deer hunting games yet but this one seems like it could be better, im camparing the grafics to games like Medal of Honer Alliad Assault witch my computer eats it up , but has problems with this deer game, i have to set everything to its lowest setting so it dosnt freeze up on me.All the deer look the same, the varmits you can shoot but you dont get points or anything for them, the game just seems primative to the 2002 pc world, im going to try others. And to all you hunters out there good luck this upcoming season."
4,Good reference work,"The Big Cats by Alan Turner is a very thorough discussion of the cat family, past and present. It also sports illustrator Mauricio Anton's splendid sketches and paintings of various members of the family. Those of extinct cats bring them to life in a way that the usual drawings of the skull and skeletal remains cannot. There is a thorough discussion of taxonomy in general and of classification of cats in particular. Unfortunately while the drawings are wonderful and the information dense, the book is not light reading. It might be useful to the professional paleontologist or zooarchaeologist looking for a good overview of cat remains or possibly appeal to the dedicated cat lover, but I can't imagine settling in by the fire on a quiet evening with the book. Its most appropriate place might be in a school library for reference use by students doing classroom projects on cats, paleontology, biology, ecology, etc."
4,"I love OTC, but this....","The threads on the largest bearing puller were damaged, I was able to restore that portion so no problem. It worked exactly as advertized. I just wish I wouldn't have had to fix it out of the box, thank goodness I took the time to look at it thoroughly. You will be pleased with this tool."
5,Prayer,This is an excellent book. It explains many different prayer styles. This is a great referrence book. Everyone will be able to enhance their relationship with GOD by using the methods in this book.
2,Not entirely Scripturally accurate,"I ordered this book based upon the reviews of other readers, but I quickly discovered that it was not everything I had been led to believe.The book had some good points and nice concepts, but I found a number of instances in which I believe the book was not consistent with Scripture, in my opinion.This could possibly be attributed to the fact that the author is a Quaker, a group in which many of the followers openly deny the scriptures as our final authority for conduct and doctrine. Please understand that I am not accusing Mr. Foster of such beliefs, nor am I arrogant or ignorant enough to think that my denomination is the only one with correct doctrine.But I was not comfortable with many things in this book and would therefore be hesitant to give it a positive recommendation."
4,Prayer:Finding the Heart's True home,bought this for a group study.............the group is finding it thoughtful and challenging. They like it very much. It was packed and shipped properly
5,Foster makes prayer less of a mystery,"This book presents prayer as a multifaceted jewel that is a wonder to behold no matter how you hold it up to the light. Foster examines and describes very simply every aspect of prayer imaginable. This is absolutely THE BEST book I have ever read on the subject. It is a wonderful read. A book to be read, re-read and re-re-read until it becomes part of the fabric of your life."
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"The book is probably fine for those interested in a mainstream approach to prayer. I hoped for a more liberal, open-minded approach. I liked the table of contents categories, but the strict Trinitarian approach was not what I was hoping for."
4,A thoughtful book,"I enjoyed this book a good deal. The subject matter was great. I read it for a class at church and think we read too many chapters a week. This is a book you will want to take your time digesting, as some of the subject matter is rather heady."
5,A Classic in Christian Spirituality,"If I were to own one book on prayer, this would be the one. Foster has spent a lifetime teaching prayer and the spiritual disciplines. This book is the distillation of a profound life. His teaching is clear, his thinking incisive. I have used and recommended this volume (and Foster's Celebration of Discipline) for years. After a decade on the shelf, I worked my way through it again this year. I was awed by new insights. It reminded me of Mark Twain's comment about his father, ""When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much the old man had learnt in seven years."""
2,A quick review,"Just a note: I read the 2001 revised edition of Jaws of Honda.Hoag offers a tid bit of history regarding the fate of seven U.S. destroyers (as well as the steamship S.S. Cuba at San Miguel Island) that smashed up on shore or were run aground at ""the Devil's Jaws"", and some of the people who responded to the crisis.This brief, and mostly photographic, history is interesting for those who like shipwrecks. The down side to this book is that it was poorly written, and for me that takes away from the story that's being told."
3,Not the Oscar version,I saw this movie thinking it was the short film that won the Academy Award two years ago but it wasn't. This one was made at the American Film Institute in the mid-80's. It's a nice version of Faulkner's story but I reccomend you check out the version that one the Oscar in 2003.
1,Disapointed!,"When you order a book that states ""Worked Problems in ..."" you expect the problems to have worked solutions. Fully 85% to 90% of the problems have no solutions at all. Problems 1 to 51 also have no solutions. If you are looking for a study aid with solved problems skip this one. If you are looking for a book on applied mathematics skip this one."
3,Terrible quality,"Lots of colors, excellent for notetaking, but the whole thing started breaking after 3 weeks. The case is cracked and the tab for selecting colors is broken. Very dissapointed with the durability.EDIT: After leaving this review, the company sent me a replacement pen. Great company to work with, but I wonder how long this pen will last."
2,meh,"My daughter, 9, was very excited to get this, as she loves multi-colored pens. She is not at all hard on her things, and keeps her pens on her desk. This one cracks almost right away, and the ink was very unreliable. She was very frustrated every time she wrote with it, and threw it away within days."
1,wow this blows,this has to be the most god-awful thing i have ever heard in my life. the bands on this cd absolutely suck.
2,Need better bands,"i love ac/dc, and i also love death metal. together the two sound LAME. this album could be better if they had more talented bands with better vocals. the bands that performed on this cd didnt mix their own sound into the ac/dc sound very well, and it would have been better if they had more of their own sound. maybe next time they should try bands that could do a good job on covers like dimmu borgir, or try bands like shadows fall who did an amazing cover of ""welcome to the machine"" by pink floyd. overall i say you should not buy this cd, the sound will give you a headache if you are a hardcore ac/dc fan, but if you like death metal and ac/dc, give it a shot, and if you despise it, you can make fun of it or give it to a friend."
4,this game is fun but really hard to get threw,when i first got this game i played it alot-but since its hard to get threw it i've stoped playing it for a while.
3,Dogfighting goes to the dogs... 7/10,"I picked up a copy of Snoopy PSP yesterday - it was on sale for just $17. If you enjoy dogfighting simulations it's fun. The piano music and FMVs are 'cute' if you like the old Charlie Brown Christmas TV special. The in-game 3D graphics are well-done and look good. The bombing missions are easy, but the dogfighting itself is fairly challenging.On a scale of one to ten I'd rate it a 7. I'll probably play Snoopy for a while and then sell it."
1,Don't Know!!!!,I don't know if it was just this stack I purchased or not. I have had more bad disk's than good ones just keeps saying there is no memory actually on the discs. It is like HP messed them up when making them. I believe out of the pack of 100 I have been able to use maybe 25. Really upset that I wasn't able to use more and trying to decide whether to re-order these or not. Think I am going with something different.
2,Many Defects,"I have had a ton a problems with these discs. After about 30 minutes of a DVD, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. Looking at the burn side of the disc, there is a area where you can see the burning stopped and I guess picked again. Do not recommend."
1,Agree with Terre,"I use this brand all the time, especially when they are on sale at Fry's, and very seldom get a bad disc. Probably 98-99% good. However, I ordered two cake boxes from Amazon, and the packaging was dreadful. Evidently the postman set them down roughly on my concrete steps, and all the little plastic tabs holding the lid on broke off. This should not happen with adequate bubble wrap. There was hardly any cushioning in the box. I'd like to buy more of these discs, but I am reluctant to take a chance based on this experience."
1,Poor Packaging,The box was too big and allow the spindle to bounce around in box and plastic covering spindle which keeps the blank DVD in place was broken and DVD were off the spindle. If that is the only size boxes have should put more packing so it will not allow spindle to move at all.
4,Like it,"After receiving this DVD+R, I think I should order the 50 piece spindle. I did not burn too often. I believe it is enough for 2 years. I tried a couple of discs, anyway, like it."
1,No Good,"Produces about 25% coasters, and another 10-15% that won't play on DVD players. The first half was about what I expected, a few coasters, a couple minor errors. The second half I was lucky to get maybe 5 that worked flawlessly. No good!"
2,Many bad discs,"HP needs to work on quality control, there are a lot of bad discs in here. It's hit or miss, sometimes you get a decent one, sometimes you get a crappy one. You won't find out till you play the disc in your DVD player and you see all the weird digital artifacts. Pretty annoying."
4,HP 16 X 4.7GB DVD+R,Media seems to function very well. If it continues to do so I will definately be buying again for the price.....
4,an overly comprehensive review,"I do agree that this textbook is a very well-done, well written book with a lot of value for anesthesiologists. However, as a tool for oral board study it is actually a bit too comprehensive and inclusive. Take my word for it, during your oral board exam you are not going to be asked about histologic changes in the bronchial mucosa of the asthmatic or the synthetic pathway of catecholamines. The person studying for the oral anesthesiology board doesn't have time to waste learning material that he or she doesn't need to know. I recommend instead Clinical Cases in Anesthesia by Reed. Same format, much more focused on the material that the anesthesiologist must know for the oral exam."
4,VERY pleased!!,I love it!! It's just as pretty as the picture and it looks great on my couch. You may need to iron it but all in all it's perfect. I wish I could find a matching one for my sofa chair. I even bleached it to give it more of a shabby chic look. Great product!
1,Awful!,"I bought one for my loveseat and one for my wingchair. The fabric is EXTREMELY cheap and flimsy, and thinner than my bedsheets. The loveseat size was too small in the seat cushion area of my 68"" long loveseat even though it's supposed to fit up to 73"", and at the same time very baggy in the arms and back. After several hours of my sister and I trying to get it to work, I put it back in the package and returned it along with the chair cover which was so big, no amount of tie-cinching would help."
3,Nice,This is a nice product. I have bought surefit before and really liked their products. This one fits as expected. I love the color!
1,Small slipcovers,The two slipcovers that I bought (they were the same size) for my two loveseats were much more smaller. I'm still thinking what to do with them because there wasn't any return address.......................
5,Amazon is A-one,"The little keychain I ordered came in and was exactly as pictured. The quality is excellent AND it ""does the job."""
2,KEEP LOOKING...,"Yes, it looks cool. Yes, it'll wake you up in the morning. But, the SOOTHING SOUNDS??!!! More like an electronic colliape - it's really tragic that it sounds so bad. Honest, you'll NEVER use the soothing sound component to fall asleep or wake up. After my son bought it with his Christmas money (which burns me even more) I kept trying to figure out how to make the soothing sound actually sound soothing. Well, no can do. It really just sounds bad."
4,Good album from a brilliant voice,"This album showcases the diversity of Don's musical tallent. Although Don is perhaps remembered more for his appearances in ""It Ain't Half Hot Mum"" and ""Dad's Army"" this album truly shows his best tallent; his wonderful voice.The classic ""Whispering Grass"" is good however I prefer the original 70's version featuring the duet with Windsor Davies but on the whole this is still a very good album.R.I.P. Don"
2,Returned mine...,"Torch was not hot at all. Flame seemed weak and strangely diffused. Slightly tipping the torch would cause a clog and it couldn't be relit for quite some time. Seal between the torch and tank is the ultra modern material, cork. Due to this, the tank had to be cranked on very tightly to prevent leakage which I'm sure wasn't good for the threads. I wanted to like this because it's made in the area I live in. Having a job is always nice... lol. But, I would recommend looking at another brand. To be fair, I only tried this with propane. It may work better with MAPP. A multi-fuel torch this size should work fine with propane though, and this one did not. Could be mine was just defective..."
4,Excellent discussion of author's development in tai chi,"This book is related to, but should not be considered a sequel to the author's book, ""There Are No Secrets,"" about his studies with Chen Man Ching. It is, however, an excellent discussion of how the author incorporated his tai chi studies into his life and thoughts, and his growth as a martial artist. I recommend it highly as a companion to his earlier book."
4,Even the bad guys are cool!,"I actually got this book at a cheap book sale... Well I got my moneys worth and then some.In this fantasy book,you could actually root for both the good guys and the bad.There is quite a lot of depth put into both opposing forces.The wolves are awesome as well as Kothra and Abbas Bute.This book also has an anime-flair to it with the way it was told and the way some characters are portrayed.Recommended."
4,Great book - poor printing,"This book is a clasic, and it is great that it has been reprinted in soft covers.Unfortunately the print quality is very bad. It looks worse than a set of photocopies."
1,Very Basic,I bought this book but the information was so basic I cannot recommend anyone pay the asking price.
5,Understanding e-books 101,This book gave great meaning to what e-books really are now. How you can right your own as well. If your crazy about this new technology then you want this.
5,You Are There,"The enjoyment gotten from Long Ago And Far Away was in completely foreseen areas. The chance for us to learn about seatrading and the process of a Scottish family's immigration to the United States catches you off guard. All the material was woven really simply within a sense of a young man's life and an innocent period in the music culture. You watch and almost participate as all the forces come of age. The chapter on Ike Taylor in Antarctica was a surprise, frightening. Everything comes together, not like a puzzle, almost like a tapestry (Carole King plays is a large role). No words or details felt unneeded, which helped the flow forward, as if it was a travel book. It makes us wonder what we take for granted with other people's fame and its price."
1,"Everybody but James Taylor, Choppy with excessive filler","The author was obviously starved for real James Taylor information, and launches on tangent after tangent..... even after an extended tease, there is little true insight or information about James. A waste of money and time."
3,Like reading an encyclopedia,"If you want to know everything in the world about JT's music history, including practically every person he ever shook hands with, read this. If you're looking for something to put you to sleep at night, read it. If you're looking for a good, readable biography, skip it."
2,A Lesser Lang,"Despite a fine cast and first-rate Warner Bros. production values, ""Cloak and Dagger"" (1946) remains one of director Fritz Lang's lesser efforts. Set during the final months of World War II, this espionage thriller begins promisingly with Gary Cooper as an American physicist sent on a mission to rescue a scientist from his Nazi captors, who have succeeded in developing an atomic bomb. Unfortunately, this intriguing premise runs out of steam at the halfway mark - weakened by a lengthy romantic subplot. ""Cloak and Dagger"" would have been more effective if the studio had retained Lang's original ending in which Cooper's character discovers the abandoned location where the Nazis made their atomic bombs. Instead, the film is saddled with a predictable, ""Casablanca""-inspired finale. Though ""Cloak and Dagger"" falls flat, there are a few memorable sequences in the classic Lang tradition."
1,Aviation Consumer Used Aircraft Guide,"I'm rating this a one star to get your attention to ask: Is this the 3rd or 7th addition. If you are buying this book, you should know which edition you are buying. I have the 3rd and the 7th.They are both excellent."
2,K in FLA- and a House,"This is not properly a biography--more a writer's literal journey into past neighborhoods where Kerouac spent his time(s) in Florida. A biography that inserts the writer is always annoying to me. The writer tells of his quest and his impressions. I don't really care, I am more interested in the facts...There are recollections from locals about Kerouac's life but they are distanced and circumstantial, nothing is very comprehensive or revealing. This book is about a house Kerouac lived in and how it was designated as a historical place (Orlando) and now a residence for writers to be. A noble enterprise, no doubt. The problem here is the research is weak and those who really knew Kerouac are long dead."
1,NOT AN INTERRACIAL ROMANCE SAVE YOUR MONEY,This book is not an interracial romance maybe some fan tagged it in an effort to get as many people as possible to buy it. But if you an interracial romance fan save your money.
2,Sincererly yours--No plot,"When Max decides to find a new relationship with his cousin, things turn for the worst. After years of searching for that special person, Max decides to look at the family tree for some sweet 'lovin. After dating his 3 sister, he decided to turn against his Arkansas ways and look somewhere else for his true love. Unfortunatley for his friends bi-sexual gopher he did not look down the lines of the ""farm tree."" After finding his cousin and a midget stuck together in a small tree (midgets have a hard time climbing) he decided to write ""Dear Abbey"" for advise. While waiting for his fateful answer from Abbey, Max decides to sell his soul to Satan. This book ended after he sold his soul. I believe the author was trying to create the illusion of peace and happineness, only to come back to a non-exsisting plot. Over all I would give this book a 5 for the wonderful example of nonemplotomonemipathy. Few books go to this level. I applaud you...clap, clap."
1,Quality not as described!,This was listed as an item I purchased previously in the past. I needed a new set of sheets that were the same as the one's I have. I was skeptical because the price was about half what I paid previously. The sheets were not thick/heavy like the one's I have. These are very thin and not at all like the 1200 thread count sheets that I have.

2,Mirror?,"Being called ""Sterling Silver"" and ""Xtreme Mirror Silver""... I expected a bit more than a shiny tint. I atleast expected something.. silver, or with a mirror finish. Just because something is reflective does not make it a ""mirror."" On that same token, it really isn't very reflective, which I'm sure has something to do with the %50 light transmission. Regardless, this tint sucks. Returning."
2,Not a good mirror quality you can see right through it,"It is not what I thought it would be or what I have seen on other cars, it has a slight shimmer but you can see right through it."
1,Buyer beware,"I ended up returning this item. Be aware that the light transmission is 50%, meaning you can see completely through this film, and I know it says Xtreme Mirror Silver and whatnot... But when you get the package it is only 20% reflective.... Hardly a noticeable mirror to me at all.. I tried to give this stuff the benefit of the doubt and layered it up... Doesn't matter how many times you layer it, you can see completely though the whole roll...If you're looking for something like privacy window tint...Just pay the extra $10 and get that from your local hardware shop instead.. Not worth the trouble... I WILL thank Amazon 1 million times though for their amazing customer service with returning this product though...!! No trouble whatsoever. If I can figure it out I will add customer images for you all."
2,Mosby's anatomy,"The main problem with this book is that it has quite a few typographical errors, mainly noticable when the author informs us of incorrect locations and/or functions for muscles, bones, etc. Many clear illustrations make this a good resource if you have a reliable ""other"" book to give you the correct information!"
4,Energy Management Handbook - Third Edition,"The Energy Management Handook was purchased in order to review for the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) Certified Energy Manager (CEM) exam. Having read the entire 700 page book during the review I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in energy auditing/management techniques. Covers boilers, steam systems, heat recovery, building envelope, electrical systems, controls, etc.William Wilcox / Mechanical Electrical Systems Coordinator / Dana Corporation / Toledo, OH"
3,Good travel book with interesting ending.,"I was told this book had great travel appeal due to length & pace. I found this to be true. I was able to read over a three day business trip.The characters are well developed, the story progresses at rate that keeps you interested, the sites are well known. Kind of surprise ending!A good first effort."
4,Very Visual,Recently read it on a recommendation. Easy to picture the action in your head. Authors showed great choice of words and actions to get message across. Surprise Ending.
3,Where are the earlier reviews,"What happened to all the earlier reviews of this book? There were a few. I know I wrote one; this is one of the books that had just atrocious scan errors. Whole paragraphs missing. Perhaps it has been rescanned and put back up on the site? If so, how come those of us who bought it earlier are not getting the better, corrected version?"
2,Perhaps the Right Artists but not the Original Recordings,"When I bought this I specifically looked for any disclaimers regarding original artists and recordings, etc. I didn't see any. Lo and behold ! When the CD arrived, there is fine print in the lower left hand corner that says ""This album contains new stereo recordings performed by the featured artists.""Sorry, but with the way some of the ""new stereo recordings"" sound I would rather have the originals. All I can say is that you get what you paid for !"
4,Splendors of spirit:Swedenborg Quest For Insight,"I found this DVD to contain excellent information although the picture wasn't of the greatest quality but for a very old film we were still able to enjoy the workings of an incredible man. I am sure that this film will help others to understand that life is a circle and an eternal circle of life. Our existence is for ever, our earthly body just for awhile. It was received well by my meditation students who are in the process of learning more of their spiritual path."
1,This DVD will not play on all DVD players ...,"Like the other reviewers I find the life of Swedenborg and the movement that resulted from his beliefs fascinating. Unfortunatly this DVD (I tried 2 different DVDs) wouldn't play in my Toshiba SD-3109 DVD player. I live in the USA and haven't had any trouble with any other DVDs playing in my Toshiba, so I am a little puzzled as to what is going on here with this DVD. Anyways, I just wanted to give those a 'heads-up' who are considering purchasing this DVD that it may not play in their DVD player. Before purchasing I suggest you rent a copy from your local DVD store or Netflix to make sure it will work in your player."
1,Too strong,"I tried a dosage of 5 tablets before bed; and it was much too strong. I tried 3 tablets and still too strong. Be careful because the recommendation I got was out of a diet book that I really respect, and this was the only product that I did not agree with. Some people like it. I will not use it."
5,Great product!!,I heard about Mag 07 from JJ Smith book and I love it. Great product!! It does the job without cramping or pain and I've noticed weight loss also with the use of it. I will always keep a bottle on hand!!
4,Great product!,This product does exactly was it says. I saw immediate results after the first two days of using the product. There was no cramping nor discomfort. I recommend you start off slow with 2 pills and then increase as your body becomes tolerates the product. I would reccommend this product to anyone who has problems with their ability to eliminate.
4,Unsure,I have started using but im not sure about how they are working yet haven't seen any results. I will say one thing that is you have to take so many at a time and they are large in size. The bottle tells you to take five a night and it will have you up all night using the bathroom.
3,Not That Great Of A Book,"I bought and read this book for my biotechnology class and I really did not like it very much. There are certain parts that are understandable. But much of the book was just blah, blah, blah. If you have to take a class on biotechnology, or just want to read a biotechnology book, this fits you. If you really don't want to read these kind of books, I would not recommend it."
1,beverly kills is'nt the best c.d. i'v ever hered,Beverly Kills is'nt even half as good as the great malinko I.C.P.has calmed down way to much for my personality.
1,faulted attempts at another's genre,"There are far too many young people listening to this music who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
5,listen to this cd and I garuantee you'll love it.,if you've listened to this cd give me a hell yeah. this cd rocks and if you don't have it you're missing out on a fresh album.
3,Decent album for their structure,"This EP is lowly mastered, seems like straight from a vinyl master. The content is violent and vulgar. But it's ICP. Beats are alright, but great they weren't part of the album itself."
4,"Awesome game, But too many BUGS!!!","This game is awesome, that said, it also has so many bugs you will pull your hair out! I still go back and play it all the time though. Thats how great it is. Once this game is patched.(hopefully for the last time, when i got the game there was a 36MB patch) That tells me that the game was rushed to the selves. If you can get past all the Bugs you will have a great game to play. This is a 5 star game The only problem is they just didnt finish the game. To many BUGS!!!"
5,I love this band,Tracked down this band from watching Memphis Beat. Not going into a song by song detail - just that I love this music. That's pretty much my review.
3,Unstable Firewire,"My system used to have a 3-port Firewire PCI card, a 4-port USB card, and an Ethernet card. I ran out of slots for other things and this card seemed like the perfect way to consolidate.I've been using this card for about a week. I've had no problems with the USB or Ethernet connections. However, the Firewire connection is very unstable. I am constantly having dropped connections, buffer overloads, etc. To make sure it wasn't my devices or cabling, I replaced my firewire connections into my old Firewire PCI card. The issues promptly went away. Maybe I just got a bum card, but what I ordered was a 3-in-1 and what I got is a 2-in-1."
5,You need this card,"This ethernet combo card was the best investment I've made to my older PC yet! I've been stuck with USB 1.0 for long enough and I did not have an empty slot! So, I replaced my ethernet card with the SIIG JU-2NE012 and turned on my PC. That is it! Windows found the card and all is well. If you are in the same position as me, go for it; you will thank yourself!"
5,Works with Windows 2000,"If you've read my other reviews describing frustrations with external USB Ethernets, this card has turned out to be the solution to all my problems. It works flawlessly in my computer, including the FireWire.My only advice is to get a Cat5 or Cat6 Network Cable with gold pins, to connect to your modem, along with a spray shot of Contact Cleaner. This will cost you a few extra bucks, but if you attempt to use cheapie Ethernet cables, they'll wiggle loose in the socket and frequently disconnect you from the internet."
5,Outstanding!!!! I would give 10 stars if I could.,"I was turned on to this CD when doing a medical missionary trip to Mexico in 2005. I still listen to it all the time. Some on the lyrics will bring tears to your eyes. I highly recommend to all Christians, especially for worship."
4,A Highly Enjoyable Soundtrack,I must give a special mention to Javed Akhtar for really writing some winning lyrics. It's nice to see dad support his son Farhan on what I believe is the first production from Excel Entertainment directed by someone else.Vishal-Shekhar do not disappoint with this album and I am sure the music still is on the best of 2007 list. There is not a bad song on the album and the music is truly refreshing to hear. This one is a must buy and will be at the top of your playlist for weeks. Different music styles are blended together to produce a highly enjoyable soundtrack from two of the most versatile maestros in Bollywood.
3,**Warning to those who prefer happy endings,"This is a tragically bittersweet story. I absolutely hated what the author did to the main character. She doesn't get the guy, she doesn't get a ""place in the world"", nada. If you prefer stories with a happy ending, this is not for you. If that isn't so necessary, then this book might be for you. The characters are fleshed out and the story line is engaging."
3,Serious Let Down Ending,"The series was very good, the entire story was terrific, but the ending was so simplistic you find yourself wondering ""is Ms. Fallon serious?"" That being said, the series was enjoyable."
4,Best of the Series,"I enjoyed the first two books, but the author seemed to take more time in character development and plot in this third installment."
4,Good Game,"It's a good game for people who like to hunt. Especially like hunting varmints, which you are allowed to hunt in this game. One warning, make sure to check the requirements for the game. It takes a powerful machine to run it. It was not choppy at all for me but I have a 1 ghz machine. One thing that did happen, sometimes the graphics froze but all I had to do was control escape and the game would minimize and when I maximized it again it did fine. It's very realistic and I think it's worth the price. I have played all 5 of the series and enjoy this one the best. Enjoy!"
4,hello,"This game is definitely worth buying for the inexpensive price but I don't really like the videos.I've had it for two weeks and I am still wery addicted to it.So if you like hunting you should definitely buy this game, its sequel (big game hunter 6), or try out trophy hunter 2003. If you do get this game I reccomend you to use a tree stand when hunting all animals. Also, don't buy this game in the 4-pack with other Cabela's games because the others are absoloutly no fun at all."
3,Beautiful Morments.,"There are the greatest dancers in the world, both who are still dancing and had already retired. And the best seans of each ballet.I'm happy that I can see Bussell and Corp, such a beautiful couple from The Royal Ballet. Now we have less chance to see this couple because they have a different partner each other. I saw exactly the same sean of ""Price Of Pagoda"" in this Video when the opening gara of new opera house in London with this couple. Their partnership is parfect like dream, even they have less chance to dance togather. You can see them on this video!"
2,"The word ""Ultimate"" should not be in the title","A good basic guideline for the beginner-hobbiest. The author had a great idea for a book, but obviously has no hands-on experience. He should have looked up the definition of ""ultimate"". If you're looking for guidance to the best, save your money."
1,Picture on the cover doe not match the content.,This book was not very helpful at all in building my garage shop to restore a 67 Mustang in. Better to get your ideas from surfing the web. Seems like it was writen many years ago and a new cover was put on it. Basicly for the 1950's capenter that wants to build wooden storage racks in their garage.
4,"HOW DO I SPELL RELIEF? ..."" YOU SHOULD WRITE A BOOK!""","At last! Detailed (and pithy) information on how to self publish. For those of us outside the literary glitterati, this is a goldmine of tried- and-true nuggets of experience. I'm glad Ms Beck trod these roads....so I don't have to.This book not only delivers the hoped-for information, but is loaded with resourses, many of which I would have NEVER thought of, and probably wouldn't have researched even if I had. Almost as important, the inspirational stories of those authors (people just like me)who've written and published (and cashed the checks) really got me going! Do I really have a story to tell? Looking around, I'd say the answer is a resounding ""YES!"" Thank you Ms. Beck! See you in the NYTimes bestseller list!"
2,So many errors,"I got this free from a friend, but if I bought a book I'd go for one with fewer typos, misdefinitions, and other errors because it can cause confusion and slow you down. Not to mention any and all the errors I missed and took for fact. I'm halfway through the book and am now constantly checking the book's claims against textbooks and the web. This may be ""bad learning"", but it's better than not brushing up at all for the MCAT."
3,"Decent, but their second CD is better","This was the debut CD from Seafood. It is very decent, especially the single This Is Not An Exit, also Belt, Guntrip and Folksong Crisis, but this is heavily derivative of several bands, especially The Pixies. This is an indierock CD following the tradition of the Pixies' own Surfer Rosa, but at times the obsession gets too much. Seafood's second CD When Do We Start Fighting is catchier, more original and better produced - the tunes are just better. This one's decent too though."
2,Great look & feel - terrible quality sole.,"I purchased two pair of Sudini boots in November 2007 (a tall waterproof leather pair and an ankle boot). They both look great and are incredibly comfortable. However, within two months the heels give with each step (they slide out from under the sole away from the arch) and the sole is detached from the upper at the toe. This occurred with both pairs. My cobbler was able to add stabilizers to link the heel to the sole beneath the arch which will prevent the wobble. But this is just a temporary fix and should not have been necessary after just two months of light wear (1-2 days a week per pair)."
3,Misleading information,"When placing my order, I thought I was ordering 1 of Black Flag Roach Motel. I also thought the price was steep, but I was having trouble finding it elsewhere, so I ordered 1. Apparently 1 of Black Flag Roach Motel means 1 CASE of Black Flag Roach Motel (12 boxes). Now I know why the price was so high. I hope it works."
3,Helpful for the inexperienced. Low quality filming.,"It is what it is. Budget instructional vid on field dressing. I got this for a less experienced friend and viewed it before giving it to him. It's a useful video for sure. Some things are performed different than the way I'd do it but always good to see others techniques. Could have been a bit more extensive on in the field techniques for field dressing bucks on the ground. Several scenarios of dealing with the pelvic region, rectum and bladder. Stuff that usually is problematic for first timers."
4,"Not bad, some things could have been done better.","I gave this an extra star just for the guy being a true entrepreneur and getting his video camera out to make a homemade ""how to"" video. I thought they did extremely well.My biggest complaint about this video is that they could have done the field dressing during the day time or at least with better lighting than what the camcorder had. They could have also payed more attention to the shot angles. There were a few other annoying things as well. But like I said it is a homemade video and I thought it was done well for that reason.I enjoyed the video and would probably purchase this again. I have not watched any other videos on this subject so I cannot compare it to another, possibly professionally done, video."
5,SOM wishes they were this GOOD!,"The 2 releases by ""the Merry Thoughts"", is what the ""Sisters of Mercy"", should have been. Marvin Arkham vocals, and the bands xcellent gothic groove, bring Gothic music up to date, however, looking for a new release by tMT's soon... Buy both of these now...!!!"
3,Not Bad,'Will You' is the reason I bought this cd. The rest is pretty good as well.. This band sounds identical to the sisters of mercy. To those who know less they may even think this is the Sisters of Mercy but it's just a few guys doing their best sisters imitation. I'd be afraid to hear them actually cover a sisters song.
5,Very relaxing...this truly works!,"I bought this as part of the Wellness Pack that included ""Stress"" and ""General Wellness"" CDs, but ""Healthful Sleep"" is by far our favorite of the three. ""Healthful Sleep"" has changed my husband's life. He used to take medicine to help him relax at night. He could sleep, but it wasn't restful...he thrashed, had nightmares, and always felt tired - even after 12+ hours of sleep. After using this, he was able to quit taking medicine because he began sleeping so restfully. I also sleep much more soundly and feel more rested. The mornings after I listen to this CD, I feel what I can only describe as 10 years younger. It occurs to me that truly healthful sleep would certainly improve general wellness and prepare you to deal effectively with stress. If you can only afford one, get ""Healthful Sleep""."
4,A bizzarre portrait of a bizzarre band,"This is no ordinary documentary. It's an absurd manifesto that has it all: From full-costume french revolutionaries lynching mannequins of the band members, to semi-porno scenes, to cartoon sequences. From an accordionist's rendition of ""Anarchy in the UK"" (complete with french lyrics), to an orchestral arrangement of the same tune. However, the real fiber of the film are the live segments of the band, plus a couple of what can only be called ""music videos"" of Syd Vicious solo. A must-see for either the rock-curious or the punk fan.Punk filmmaking?"
3,A punk classic...you might as well see it.,"I will admit, i was dissapointed by this one. Mostly because it seems to be more about Malcolm McClaren tooting his own horn then it is a story about the band. What i enjoyed most were the interviews, documentery footage, and videos of the ex-pistols. The ""story"", if you can call it that, with Mr. McClaren and Steve Jones seemed kinda dull. Sid was fun to watch, and his version of ""My Way"" is frightening and fun. Watch it, but don't expect too much."
3,"I'd like to say this movie was great, but.....","This is a decent movie if you have the knowledge of the band, but even at that I say decent not even necessarily good. The movie has low production value and tries way to hard to prove a point plus the storyline is kind of loose. I truly believed that the movie was made for two reasons, one to make fun of their manager who ripped them off. Aside from that a way to put there music videos out and to sell a cd that probably wouldn't exist otherwise. I would reccomend instead of this the ""Filth and The Fury""(The Sex Pistols Documentary) or ""Rock 'N Roll Highschool! Odds are if your a fan you will buy this anyway so enjoy it for what it is but don't hope too high."
5,Finally on DVD,"If you have a multizone DVD player, now its time to purchase this rare film on DVD from www.amazon.co.jp (released on 25 September 2003). It's with Japanese subtitles (who cares, I... being Romanian don't) and on zone 2 , NTSC. Hurry, God knows when the DVD it will be available also in zone 1!"
4,swindled?,"The Great Rock And Roll Swindle is a good movie. it has Mclaren's take on how the Pistol's came about,swindled their way to almost a million pounds,and then disbanded.Johnny Rotten does not seem to play a big part in the movie though.Sid has a good scene where he shoves a tart in a whore's face.the ""My Way""sequence is also entertaining.Overall a scandalously good flick."
5,A Great Look Back,"This is important as John Beverly is dead for many years,watching this recalls memories of these youths in the prime of their rebellion.In these times this film seems a novelty once more.Each member of the band plays up to the camera in his own time. I couldn't pick a favorite scene as I like the whole film, but the end with the obituaries of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungeon stand out as a sad memoir that that realize that there was Fragility behind the tough grimaces."
3,completely halarious...,"this is probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time! I loved steve's little detective scenes, but McLaren's warped view of reality is what i found most entertaining, (i especially liked the part in the begining where he claimed he invented punk rock, yeah, all right malcolm). i was a little disappointed; however, by the lack of importance johnny rotten had in the movie, but i don't think any of it was realy meant to be taken serious at all. I loved all the live footage of the band playing, that's always great! In all, this is a funny, silly movie, but go see ""The Filth and the Fury"" if you want an actual, realistic portrayal of the band and what happened."
1,This is disgusting,"Really no one should really own this piece of filth. The images(pornography) are disturbing and really quite offensive. It is a sin just to view this with out ignorance of its content. Regardless, the DVD offers hardly any actually information on the pistols' career, but rather just shows all these performances of the band. It as well shows some cartoons which in those days, it would be unheard of to have the pistols animated. Not really an essential for a normal fan, but it is still yet entertaining. It reflects the band rather well."
5,I Love This Song,This Cd Is Very Good Even Though Its TYpe Old I Love Living My Life By Daville i Hope Everyone Has This Cd
5,A great read!,I'd have to say that this book is a great insight into the mind/emotions of a boy growing up in foster care and then adopted into an abusive family. After reading this book it made me want to continue learning about Nathan Landers (the author). I actually wanted to write to him to let him know how much I admired him for his perserverance etc. I'd say this is a great book! I hate to say it but the only negative thing I have to say about the book is that it wasn't edited well. That just goes to show that Nathan could accomplish anything he set his mind to doing. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about a REAL person.
4,Works like a charm,"Only complaint is the button doesn't have the smoothest of presses. You have to hit it right in the center, otherwise it will sort of bend and not register."
4,crunk for 00,"well all around i gotta say this album is off the chain anybody that's down with 2-pacs style then you'll love this album. personally i can relate to him because he attended my high school ""Cross Keys in atlanta,and the lyrics he wrote about on buetiful feeling are what goes on there,but anyway the best tracks are:callin me,what must i do,buetiful feeling,die famous. So if u looking for a track to bump while you flossing in your ride then get album and bump in style.And if u wanna taste of what he sounds like check out the preview section on this web site or go to his {lilzane.com}"
5,***Young World: The Future***,"Lil Zane is the second best young talented rapper out there after Nelly. This album has hot tracks and tight rhymes. Some people say Zane is the future Tupac. Zane could deffinitely improve, but no one can ever accomplish what Tupac had. Zane mixes this album up with fast tracks and then some slower tracks. The best tracks on this album are""Callin' Me"" ""What must I Do"" ""Die Famous"" ""Whats Up"" ""You must really Love Up""Check out this album if you haven't. It's worth your money. If you like Pac you'll like Zane. If you don't add this cd to your collection your missing out on something big."
1,Please,"I liked Lil' Zane the first time around. Y'all remember, right? His name was Tupac then. Oh wait, my bad...my man isn't Tupac brought back to us; he's just a style bittin herb. Anyone who buys this CD needs to add Nsync, and Puff Daddy to their order."
4,young world is the bomb,the album is really good i really like the song with 112 called callin me lil'zane is really cute and the album is good so get it.
1,Diss Games a Shame,Check It Like Diss Yall First Thangs First Diss Lil Fool Comes Out Here Wit One Hot Singel And Thankz He Owns The WorldYou Wanna No What Thay B Callin You On The Street Fool A Tupac Biter Lil Pain For The Zain So Get The Game Straight Befor You Bite A True Rider Aight Trick Same Goes For H0 Limit Let A Dead Man Rest In Peace Get Up Off His Dic Just Like Yuk Say Why Every N1gga Try To Sound Like Pac Now Adays?
1,This is just plain sad,"Here we have a little pretty boy herb tryin to bite the late tupacs style on here that single callin me with that weak happy beat i wish would vanish off the radio stations it is horrible and why does he menchain thugs on his song he is not a thug and he will never be pac because he doesnt have it in him so some advice like I heard the Rza said this kid is confused and he needs some direction and doesnt need to be bitin off pacs whole style I guess we just have to deal with another imitation until he fades out like No Limit eventually did but anyway dont support this Man until he finds an identity peace, You bit the man who bit a man who bit ten men who bit the same style you bit get off of pac and let him rest in peace theres only one. Somebody tell this little clown to let it rest hes wack."
1,WACK!,"This guy is wack! Just hearing that song Callin Me tells me he's garbage. Where is he now? One hit wonder, hahahaha. Its kinda funny that Priority records would waste their time on this wack rapper instead of promoting a true emcee like Ras kass. Don't support this 2pac wannabe.P.S. Didn't anybody notice the trend, anyone with ""Lil"" in their name are garbage: Lil Wayne,Lil Bow wow,Lil Jon,Lil Kim,Lil Romeo and Lil Zane,lol."

5,All you want in an alarm clock-radio,"This item is perfect. First and foremost a clock that never has to be manually set and always displays the exact time, date and day. Dual alarms which are easy to set, even in the dark. Sleep timer, snooze, radio, alarm. Sturdy construction. Great price. Nothing more needs to be said. Would be an excellent christmas, birthday or housewarming present."
1,Less than zero,"In short, the display is too bright (even at dimmest setting), volume was hard to adjust, tuning in stations was difficult, in general very shoddy construction, atomic clock never worked. Stay away from this one!"
2,Unintuitive controls,"I've owned three different atomic radio alarm clocks. Obviously the concept of never setting a clock is wonderful. However, the Timex clock misses the mark. Setting and controlling the alarm is a complete mess. Some engineer missed the boat during the development of this product. I pride myself on my technical ability, but this interface is just not well thought out. I recommend the Sony Atomic Radio Alarm clock. It doesn't have battery backup, but the controls are more intuitive. I work for neither Sony, nor Timex. I do expect more from Timex that this sad product. Avoid it."
1,Poor reception from Miami Beach and Hard to use controls,"I was unable to get reception of the atomic signal from Miami Beach trying several methods and several locations. In addition, the procedure for setting and turning on/off the alarms is cumbersome, difficult, and silly. Do yourself a favor, choose another clock"
4,Timex T303T Atomic Time Clock Radio is AOK,"I would agree w/ previous reviews stating this is a good clock, but the controls are a little different. After you take the time to read thru the manual & figure it out it works fine.In order to achieve max. signal strength I had to use the option to remove the antenna from it's onboard hiding place.If you remember playing w/ ""rabbit ear"" TV antennas you will need to try several positions & in my case, the signal went from weakest (1) to strongest (6)(wait about 3-5 seconds in each new trial position)I gave it 4 stars because this clock radio does what it's supposed to.It synched w/ Boulder CO atomic clock 1st time right on the hour. I then set the alarm(s) & it now keeps perfect time.I have not had to play w/ it any more than that.Radio sounds as good or better than I expected.I would have given it 5 stars if it had a built in battery backup like the Scott or the Sony instead of both AA & AAA batteries.I got this on sale & it was a bargain."
2,Timed Out,"Nice concept. Poor execution.While I have managed to get the clock sync'd (I think), this product leaves a lot to be desired.1. The casing is flimsy, thin plastic.2. The controls and instructions are anything but intuitive and clear.3. I have yet to get the clock to correctly switch from Daylight to Standard time and back again.4. The sound from the radio is rather tinny - even compared to other (cheaper) clock radios I have.Save yourself some frustration and...umm...time and find another product."
1,Seven years of low grade RAGE because of this clock,"ALARM IS BIZZARE AND COUNTERINTUITIVE TO SET !!!Man I hate this clock radio!!!!!!!I've had it for seven years, and keep meaning to give it away, smash it... anything. The alarm is just too damn hard to set. I have to drag out the manual every time. On the weekends, I just turn the radio volume down... so I just won't hear the alarm.... because it is too hard to disable it. Oh, forget setting this blasted thing in the dark... you'll be huntung down the rotten manual each time. If this thing wasn't fairly expensive, and a gift... I'm sure I'd have smashed it by now.The rest of the clock is fantastic. It has a small footprint, large display, decent enough sound, and battery backup. It is great not having to set the time.You know what... I'm gonna list mine here on Amazon. That way if someone buys it, I'll HAVE to get rid of it right away."
2,Junk,"Hard to use controls. Clock began to malfunction after 6 months, stopped working completely shortly after. Junk."
1,Very very very horrible to use,"Yeah it has a radio....great unfortunately it doesn't save it from me bashing it to bits for revenge after I get a new, better, and possibly cheaper radio alarm clock.First of all despite the so-called manual, this is by far the most unneccessarily complicated and frustrating clock to set. You literally need to punch the wall a few times to vent your frustrations of figuring how long you should hold the certain button in order for it to set, or the incredibly stupid sequences of buttons you have to press to choose or unchoose the primary and secondary alarms, or why the hell did this piece of garbage seemingly decide to set AUTOMATICALLY by itself on its default timezone/date AFTER you have finally painstakingly set it correctly to your preference.Simply just a piece of garbage made by people who want to piss off consumers."
4,Very good album,"This debut by MORE is a very good album. It has fiercing vocals by Paul Mario Day (one of the guys that went through Iron Maiden berfore the band recorded its first album), and an incredible level of energy.I would not dare to say this is better than their second (and last) album BLOOD & THUNDER, because I think that album is a masterpiece of metal, one of my all time favorites. The drums, mainly, is much better in the second album (different drummers). But, even so, WARHEAD is sheer British heavy metal from the early eighties, you will sense a smile forming up in your face, like a surprise visit of a long distance beloved friend.Very, very good."
3,Gets the ice cream made,"I needed an ice cream maker at an affordable price that was flexible in how much or little I wanted to make. So, this one fit the bill. It works great for my needs and the kids love it."
2,exlawman2,First the fiberglass tank cracked and had to be replaced and then the gears in the motor stripped. Didn't use unit often at all before I had to replace it. Wouldn't spend money on another one.
5,Excellent book!,"All of Kant's works are outstanding, but what makes the versions of Kant's works good or bad (that I can read) is the translator. Since this book is the only complete translation of both parts of ""The Metaphysics of Morals,"" I had doubts about its quality. But, as I found out, this book has been translated smoothly -- although I cannot compare it with the German version.What I like about Mary Gregor's translation, is her use of footnotes. She clearly defines Latin phrases and the layered meanings of German words whose depth and meaning would be in too hasty of a translation.Also, she introduces Kant's main ideas very well; and by doing so, expands and clarifies the ideas he presents in his treatise. The footnotes are not excessive; Gregor seems to have balanced them well. The presentation of the footnotes, typography, and the library grade (acid free) paper make this book a keeper."
3,Lies,"Lies, lies, lies. The description for comments was, ""Perfect!"" Verbatim. One word.This book was NOT perfect, in great shape, yes, but NOT perfect. There was writing all over the margins as well as a few highlighting marks, which all should have been disclosed."
4,Thomas Neslund,"I found the book, ""Branding for Success,"" most helpfull and insightfull. The point I was searching for; ""The Extent of Branding?"" How far reaching both internal, or within an organization and external, within the community was fullfilled beyond my expectations!I have a new and clearer picture of not only the importance of branding but also the process. I was totally unaware of this process prior to my read of this easy to understand,well researched volumn.Thanks Amazon for providing it, and persoanlly saving me the expense of purchasing a hard copy!"
4,A great praise experience,"Hymns Ancient and Modern takes some of the hymns that were a staple of childhood worship and reinvigorates them. The words retain their power and integrity as the music remains recognizable yet contemporary. O Worship the King, How Great Thou Art, Raise Up the Crown (All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name) and The Solid Rock (On Christ the Solid Rock) are standouts on this CD.With one exception, all of the songs on the disc are at least 100 years old; one prayer offered even dates to the 4th century. It's refreshing to listen to statements of faith that are as relevant today as when they were first offered. For another example of a freshened hymn, check out Jars of Clay's rendition of The Comforter Has Come on the City on a Hill: Sing Alleluia disc, and for a great modern hymn that carries the weight of ages, listen to the Newsboys perform In Christ Alone on Adoration: The Worship Album."
4,"Old Hymns, New Style","This is a nice updated version of some really great hymns. The selection of hymns is very good with meaningful, worshipful lyrics. Some are coupled with contemporary choruses. This is a nice sing-a-long CD for meditation or a long drive in the car."
4,Excellent,"Passion, a collection of some of the most popular young worship leaders (including Chris Tomlin, Charlie Hall, Matt Redman and David Crowder) released Hymns Ancient & Modern in 2004. There is some interpretation of the hymns, and a couple have a chorus added to them, but on the whole the artists stay quite close to the traditional tunes. To ""O Worship The King,"" for example, Chris Tomlin adds the chorus, ""You alone are the matchless King / To you alone be all majesty / Your glories and wonders, what tongues can recite? / You breathe in the air, You shine in the light."" Some of the standouts on this album are ""The Solid Rock,"" ""All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name,"" and ""All Creatures of Our God and King."" The liner notes include a brief description of each of the songs along with information about the author. It is quite a good album if you enjoy the ""Passion"" sound and are able to enjoy hymns with a bit of a worship music feel to them."
4,An Explosive Mystery,"The Killing Cards is the kind of mystery book that drives me crazy. I begin reading and can't stop. If I set the book down and try to accomplish other tasks, I find myself daydreaming and thinking about the characters in the story. The Killing Cards is quick and smart, and provides an inside look to the real police work that goes on when a homicide is being investigated. If this first Mike Amato novel is a prelude for forthcoming books in the series, I can hardly wait for the next tale."
2,Sell-out album,"This one is way too poppy and bland. The songs kind of sound like television commercial jingles. Anyway, Six Going on Seven is a great emo/indie band highlighted by ""Self-made Mess"" and ""Heartbreak's got Backbeat"" (Why is this not on Amazon?). Both are highly recommended. If you are more in TV jingles and/or recent Jimmy Eat World, stick with this one."
5,Exceptional Translation of Upanishads,The book is one of the best English translations of the Upanishads I have read. It thoroughly captures and beautifully preserves the mystical content and meaning of the Upanishad verses. I highly recommend the title to serious students of Hindu mysticism for reading and study. ...Marc
1,Item is defective and Amazon won't take it back,"This doesn't properly pressurize. I would like to exchange it for something that works! But Amazon won't direct me to information for defective items saying only that the return time has passed. As anyone who cans knows, you don't start canning the moment you buy a canner but have to wait until your items are ready. I wish I had known that Amazon won't accept defective items for exchange."
5,"Great product, great price.","You really can't beat Presto pressure cookers when it comes to quality, utility, and affordability. Sure, there are other pressure cookers out there that are of higher quality, but you're going to easily spend 3-4 times as much for one. As long as you take care of your Presto and use it correctly, it's going to serve you just as well as the high-dollar pressure cookers, and possibly for just as long.I warped the steel of my first 23qt Presto (by letting it run dry for far too long), and so I bought another one just like it. Maybe one day I'll splurge on one of those fancy-pants All American brands or whatever, but until then I'll stick with the Presto."
5,Presto 23 quart cooker/canner,"I LOVE this canner! The best price I found elsewhere was $125. I got mine for $80 with free shipping. Ordered on Thursday and had my canner by Tuesday. If you can read a timer and boil water; you can pressure can anything. Super safety features won't let you down, so don't hesitate to try home canning. Get your gauge checked at the local County Extension Office before you start and a few times each year if you use the canner alot (which is standard maintance). I took a few canner classes after my gauge was checked (it was perfect!). At the first class the instructor couldn't get the classroom canner to seal; so we used mine to teach the first class. LOL! First time the canner was ever used and it performed beautifully! Thanks for making a great product that is so easy to use!"
4,Gets the job done,"I bought this pressure canner to learn how to can with. It works good. Thre are only a couple of things that I do not like . The first thing is the canner is made of fairly light weight aluminum and it carries a warning in the manual of not to use the canner on outdoor cooking equipment such as turkey or fish cookers. There was no mention of this in the product description. This came as a shock to me. I have used it on my camp chef stove just turned down on low without any problems. The second thing is the canner is advertised a 23 quart but it will only hold 7 quart jars for canning. I would expect it to hold at least 10, but I would say it is worth the price."
5,it works,It works very well and i havent had an issues. this is the first PC I have ever owned or used and I'm very satisfied with its performance so far.
4,Works well,"This is the first pressure canner I have owned. I bought it to can venison as I am a deer hunter. It works great, and if you've never tried canned venison, give it a try. It is delicious. It takes some watching to maintain the proper pressure, but it does a great job."
3,Presto pressure/canner cooker,"I have a hard time getting the pressure just right. It may be my stove but I'm not sure. I have I have success canning, but I haven't used it just for the pressure cooking yet. The price was good!"
4,Pressure Canner,"First pressure canner we ever had. Worked really great and much faster than water bath method. We had a very good tomato crop this year, canned whole tomatoes, tomato sauce and salsa. We pressure canned the hole tomatoes and sauce but used the hot water method with the salsa. This canner worked great for both methods."
4,Newbie canner,"I have only used this for water bath canning. I have an electric stove, and I can do about 7 pints at a time (8 if I am desperate). It takes forever and a day to boil water with this, but that's because it can hold so much water. I haven't pressure cooked in it yet, but plan to do pressure canning soon."
4,Perfect size canner,Works wonderfully and is great for water bathing as well as pressure cooking. The gauge does dent easily when dropped on the floor to avoid getting burned. But it still works!
2,"Please, be careful ....","I was absolutely amazed at how HUGE this canner was. I bought it to can soups, stews, veggies, and any other sort of things that a waterbath canning wouldn't work for.The first thing I set about canning (and yes, this was the very first time I was using my pressure cooker/canner) was 3 quarts of green beans and a quart of carrots. These required the same pressure .... and the same processing time, according to the recipe I was using.I followed the recipe to a 'T' .... followed all instructions ....And the pressure cooker LITERALLY exploded. And only seconds after I had my face near it to check how the pressure was doing. Thankfully, no one (my husband was nearby too) was hurt!Please, please, PLEASE be careful .... I'm NOT the first this has happened to. No matter WHAT the USDA says, using pressure cookers CAN be dangerous ..... EVEN when you're following the instructions perfectly, as I was."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I recently purchased this unitamazon delivered on timefollowed all directions enclosed with unitupon use- with the first use the pressure gauge fogged up2nd use the white o- ring fell apart, gauge fogged up, was able to maintain pressure needed with lots of attentionweight is not graduated- twists to provide different settings but no clue on graduationspend a little more an buy a good unitstay away from this"
5,Presto Chango,This is my 2nd canner. I purchased it because the 1st one has been working so well for me. I just recently (within the last year) started canning. This unit is great for me. I can do small or large batches. It holds 7 quarts or 20 pints (of the regular mouth -18 of the wide mouth pints.)I would recommend this (and I have) to anyone that wants to can for food storage or to give items as a gift.Presto 1781 23-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker/Canner
4,Present to son,"I read all reviews before purchasing this for my son who enjoys cooking, canning,etc. He was well pleased with the canner.With all the positive reviews I couldn't pass it up. And, I was really pleased that I could have it shipped directly to him. What more could I have asked for???"
5,First time canner and I have no complaints,"This past summer was the first year I delved into canning. After doing quite a bit of research, I finally settled on this pressure canner as something economical that wouldn't break me if I decided I didn't want to can in the future. As a complete novice, I had no problems following the instructions for the canner and did both pressure canning and water bath canning with it.I also have a glass-top stove and was a bit worried about it not being able to get hot enough to keep up the pressure but found that was not an issue at all. It's probably a bit easier to regulate the pressure on a gas-top stove, but I found that if I turned the heat down to medium-high a few lbs below my desired pressure, it would maintain the pressure I wanted. The only thing I would caution for those with a glass-top stove is to be very careful when moving it, as you could easily scratch the surface of your cook top.I'm looking forward to doing even more canning next summer!"
3,"Good product, but. . . .","Good product, but it was too big and heavy for me to handle. Also, it's pretty tall and didn't fit on my stove well. Also, the pressure gauge failed after 3 uses! Tried to buy a replacement gauge, but they were backordered, and my produce couldn't wait, so I bought the 16-qt cooker/canner which arrived in 2 days!"
4,Nice and sturdy,Easy to use. This canner can hold a lot of quarts. Works good on ceramic stovetops. Happy with this purchase.
4,Presto canner is great.,The canner was for my son in CA. He has used it and is very happy with all the things it can be used for. He grows veggies and cans when they are available.
2,Presto falsley advertises the capacity of this canner.,"Purchased this canner specifically for the large capacity. Presto advertises that this canner will hold up to 20 pints at a time. I am using this to can in bulk and the first time I used it I prepared enough sauce to can 20 pints. No matter how I tried the canner only fit 18 pints, leaving me with 2 pints leftover. This cut down considerably on the efficiency of the product. I called their customer service number and found out that this complaint had been heard before. So, instead of telling me, ""it is what it is"", which was the response I got, they might consider not adverising this product falsely."
3,Smaller than I thought,"For other canning newbies, this canner holds only 7 quart jars. I am just entering the canning world and assumed I'd be able to can 23 quart jars at a time. The big one that your mother-in-law has for canning 14 quarts simultaneously is rare and expensive (look for 30 qt. for that size). Looks like it will work great, we're about to try it."
5,Presto 23 qt. pressure cooker/canner,"Arrived fast, well packed, have not used it yet. Looks fine.Good price. Just have to overcome my fear."
4,Big and worked great,I got this for my mom at christmas 2009. She likes it. She didn't think it would be so big. I got her this size because she wanted to cook tamales in it. It even cooks pinto beans very well.
5,works fine,"I got this model with a little concern about the bad reviews but it has worked perfectly.I suspect others may have overheated it or used too much water in it ,you need to turn down before reaching your desired pressure.It does stain on the interior but that's not a real problem.Read the directions and it will work fine."
3,Steam Escapes from around pressure gage,"Presto has been in business for a hundred years. Quality has degraded from the pressure cooker my mother used 75 years ago to today's model (parts made in China????). Two problems when used. First, steam escapes from around the gage no matter how tight the washer is tightened. Second, the gage filled with steam making it almost impossible to read. Looks great out of the box but what good is it if it doesn't work right. Am replacing the gage and looking for another seal."
4,Great product with one problem so far...,I've only used this as a water bath canner so far (not pressurized) but the size is great and works well on my smooth top stove. Only drawback so far is that everything comes out of the canner with a coating of white powder and the interior of the canner gets darker each time I use it. I'm not sure if it's the canner itself or the fact that our well water has some minerals in it. I didn't see any other similar comments. One of these days I plan to test it by using distilled water instead of tap. Until then I'm sticking to using it just as a canner and not putting food directly inside. Probably not a good idea anyway since it's made of aluminum and that's not entirely safe.
5,Presto Pressure Canner,The pressure canner was shipped in great time and it was everything I wanted at a very good price. Thanks so much.Roger
2,A Gasket Problem Ruined Mine After 5 Uses.,"After a few uses, the gasket failed and started to lose pressure. I scrubbed it and examined it, looked fine, but the next time I used it, all the water escaped and the bottom of the pot buckled. It is useless now. My next one will be the All American brand with no gasket."
3,Missing parts.,They need to fix their photos and their instruction book. The black cap for the regulator is not included like the instruction book says and the picture of the item shows. Later in the instruction manual the black regulator cap is not included in the pictures. Very confusing and terrible technical writers.
5,Presto Pressure Cooker,Wonderful. Just what I wanted. Received quickly and was $20 less than any other store.I am very pleased with it.
5,Awesome product,I have already done gallons of canning. Now I can see the back of my freezer. I canned all the meat I had bought on sale.
5,My favorite pressure cooker,"Love this. lets us can up great veggies and sauces. Larger size is useful and lets us do bigger batches and fewer loads, saves time and propane.The family owns three and use them a lot"
3,Excellent canner except.,This is a fantastic canner except on my second time using it the seal in the pressure gauge broke so now it's all foggy. Boo.
5,Pleased with my Purchase,I love my pressure cooker! I have already used it and have plans to use it for the rest of the winter.
5,mike s.,"Cooker works great, I've already canned over a hundred pints of green beansand 80 pints of tomatoes. Cooker is easy to clean and store."
2,Good canner for the money but does not last,"I bought this product last year in march. Used it three times and it worked as described. So I was happy. Stored it over winter and pulled it back out last week. Got one more use out of it but much like a lot of pele described in the one star reviews, it leaked steam around the gauge so I could not read the pressure. Very unsafe. However I got through my canning project. Today it leaked steam from everywhere and sounded like it wanted to explode. It will not go over 5 psi and sounds like it is close to 20.Nothing to be done due to the time lapsed.If you plan on using a canner more often than not, do yourself a favor and spend the money on a quality product but not this one.I would not recommend to anyone and with 90 dollars it is not exactly cheap."
5,Excellent Product,"We were worried about using this cooker on our glass top stove, but it works wonderfully. It takes it a while to get up to its initial pressure but well to be expected. We love it!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,content,"Greeting, This canner did the job that I needed for it to do, but after the fact for a first time the inside turned a different color. I can't make it make since. I was glad that I was not using it for anything else, If so I would have sent it back"
2,Presto vs All American,"I couldn't decide between the Presto or the All American, so I bought them both, intending to send one back. At the time I placed my order, Amazon was not selling the All American 921, so I had to order it from an outside vendor. I have only done boiling water bath canning before and had some fears of pressure canners. Reading the negative reviews of the Presto unit, where reviewers describe pressure gauges fly across the kitchen, etc., did not help. The All American canner is built like a tank, I have much more confidence in it than the Presto. I didn't actually use the Presto canner before deciding to send it back, so can't speak to its performance, but had I been able to compare these two units side by side in a store, I definitely would have chosen the All American (and saved the twelve dollars it cost to return the Presto canner to Amazon)."
3,Prompt shipment,"My canner arrived promptly and I'm putting it to good use. Since this is a seasonal item, Amazon was a great place to find a good price for a difficult item to locate outside Harvest season."
2,Presto 01781 23-quart pressure cooker / canner,"this product is the best ever! I use it all the time and will buy another one when needed, I also bought one for my mom. she loves it to."
5,Presto 01781 23-Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner,This item was shipped promptly. Was more than I expected.
4,Fine product,"I used the Presto 23-qt. pressure canner twice last week after my recent purchase and found it well-made and easy to use. It will most likely be the biggest pot in the kitchen, so it's helpful to have a high-rise water spigot and a sprayer for clean-up.Other reviewers reported the pressure gauge blowing off at first use. With that in mind I closely examined the gauge's screw threads and then made sure it was tightly, but not too tightly, installed. It gave me no trouble.Compared to my old 9-pt. canner this one's higher capacity for pint jars really sped things up! My only problem was that I could not quite cram the 10th and 20th pint jar in there, and without the 10th jar in the bottom tier, the top tier would not all stay upright. One time out of three I finally got the tenth jar to fit, but it's much too difficult to do."
5,USER FRIENDLY,"WE BOUGHT THIS PRESSURE COOKER, AND HAVE USED IT MORE THAN WE THOUGHT. IT'S SIZE IS WONDERFUL, AND EASY CLEAN UP. YES I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRESSURE COOKER TO ANYONE. THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND WE HD FREE SHIPPING!"
5,Presto Pressure Canner and Cooker a hit!,Love it!! Used it the day after I got it and I'm VERY happy! I just wish I would have ordered it a few years ago instead of waiting and thinking about it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in pressure canning. You're gonna have a ball!
4,Good,"Easy to use, easy to clean, it's safe and it saves money by allowing my family p process our own grown veggies."
5,Works Great,"I have used this canner once so far for pressure canning, and once for boiling water bath canning. I have not had any problems and everything worked great. It seems to be well made and very heavy duty. The recipes in the instruction booklet are simple and easy to follow."
5,Great Canner,Got rid of my water bath canner so I can do vegetables and meat. Works great as an open water bath canner and pressure canner. No problems at all
5,GREAT!,"This will be the last canner you will own. We have canned a ton with it, and it works great every time. Dial gauge is accurate and way better than just the petcock and the booklet is very detailed, helpful, and provides even good receipes. I would recommend this to ANYONE! I would recommend getting a second canning tray if you are going to stack the jars. It does take a while to get up to pressure and heat on an electric stove (what we have) but this canner is well worth the investment, electric or gas!"
4,great pressure canner,This canner is great and very practical. It is easy to use and holds a lot of jars. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it smells bad when I bottle things. I think it is because it is made out of aluminum. It fills the house with a bad smell so be sure to leave the windows open when you use it.
5,Presto Pressure Cooker,For the size Amazon has the best deal. This is a quality product you can depend on to fill your needs. You also can't beat free shipping. I give five stars for the shopping experience and quality of the product. Buy with confidence. Thank you Amazon.
5,Cooker,I received my cooker on time and use it on the weekend. It work great. Very happy with the purchase
4,Presto 23 Quart Pressure Cooker - wonderful,"This a great product and very easy to use.Fabulous price. I use it for cooking for a crowd, or doing multiple Christmas puddings."
4,Presto Pressure Cooker,"The Presto 01781 23-quart pressure cooker is a solid product. I had no problems using it and found it easy to clean. I do think the instruction book could use some clarification as to when to use the pressure and not, I have seen clearer directions. However because I had previous experience with pressure cookers along with the internet, I was able to figure it out."
5,Why did I wait so Long?,"I have been water bath canning food for nearly thirty years and have always been shy of pressure canning. Recently made the decision to order this caner and give it a try... what I discovered was that I cannot believe I waited thirty years to begin pressure canning! Why did I wait so long as I have used a pressure cooker for preparing food since becoming a new bride at 17 years old! I grew up watching my mother cook with a pressure cooker but for some reason was reluctant to use a pressure caner.This caner worked absolutely wonderful and the capacity of jars it can process is much more than I ever expected! If you have feared pressure canning, fear no more because the directions are well explained and easy to understand. As long as you respect this cooking tool for what it is and how it works, you should never have a problem. I love this caner!"
5,A good purchase,"I have made many batches of sauce, jam, and various pickled things with this canner now and have been thoroughly pleased. The construction is simple and easy to dismantle and clean. The thickness and weight of the metal is good and heavy, with a flat bottom with which i've seen no warping. Be aware that the interior may get darkened with use, i think this is just a chemical reaction between the aluminum and the acid in the foods i've canned.I don't use this as a pressure cooker or stock pot so i can't attest to it's capabilities in those regards. However, as a pressure canner, it works wonderfully."
4,Massive,"I have only used this once, and it functions as promised. Beware, if you are new to canning, this thing is massive and nearly impossible to lift when filled with more than 3 liters of water. I recommend going to a store to get an idea for which size canner you actually need. Then, come back to Amazon and take advantage of their great pricing! This canner is designed for large jobs, making it great for personal or gift giving projects."
5,Great canner,"works great even on a glasstop range. Everyone should consider this over more expensive brands, I've used it often since getting it and it has paid for itself already."
5,Pressure Canner and cooker,We have the same canner and purchased for my son as we can a lot of fish. Can process 2 cases of half pint jars. Love this canner!
5,Inexpensive for its sie,"the only thing i can really complain about is the direction booklet. I'd only used one other PC before so couldn't figure out how to use it for a little while.But since then, no complaints."
4,Not tall enough,"I read reviews on a lot of different canners before I ordered this one. The reason I settled on this one is because someone said it was ""really big"" and mentioned stacking quarts. Well, sorry folks, it's not tall enough to stack quarts, apparently you can't do that in any of the canners that sell for less than $300. You can stack pints and half pints, but you can do that with most of the others, too. Yes, it's a nice canner, has a nice book with it and everything, but if I had it to do over, I would've bought the model that has the pressure guard that lets you know when the pressure is going too high or too low, as I generally am busy preparing the next load while one is processing and it would be nice not to have to watch it so closely. If memory serves, I believe that one was a different brand, maybe a Mirro."
4,Very useful product,This product has been a plus in my life. It gets the job done with clear easy to follow instructions. The only flaw I can find with it is I am constantly having to tighten the handles.
5,Great product for the money,"I had an abundance of tomatoes this year and canned several using the ""water bath"" canning method. I wanted to make my own Ro-tel type tomatoes and tomato basil soup, but needed a pressure canner due to the ingredients in them. The instructions were easy to follow and I made several batches of both. I wish I had purchased this at the start of the harvest season and I would have canned a lot more."
4,Canner,We have used the canner twice now and both times it worked beautifully. The only problem we had was stabilizing the pressure during the process. You have to constantly turn the heat down to keep the pressure from rising to high. All in all a good purchase.
4,pressure canner,"This product was all I expected it to be. The top was a little difficult to put on at first, but after using it a few times I got used to it. The illustrations in the directions were a bit confusing, so I had to ask someone who was familiar with using a pressure cooker to help me."
2,Kinda cheap,"Was in a hurry when I ordered this. Should have reviewed it a little closer. It is an OK canner. Much flimsier than a quality one, but it works. Made in China.There is a better alternative, although it costs more. Search for All-American cooker/canner."
4,Presto Canner is great except NO STEEL ONES available anymore,"Presto Canner is great except NO STEEL ONES available anymore.ALUMINUM is bad for humans internallyso I can't fill it with apples to make applesauce.I have to place a pot with a lid inside to keepaluminum out of the food. But it will let mepressure can meat and fish, as they are alreadyin clean glass jars.[...]"
2,probably works fine but good luck testing the pressure gauge,"The instructions in the package say to have your university extension service test the pressure gauge before using it (to make sure it doesn't explode in your face I suppose!) However, my local extension service no longer does this test (Minnesota) so I have no way to test the safety of the gauge. Makes it a little scary to use the product. So now I have a really expensive boiling water canner."
3,Presto 23 Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner,"The item arrived as pictured. I have not had a chance to use it yet. These are the drawbacks: 1. Item was not well packed but arrived with no scratches or dents, 2. Item has a film of oil or grease on it..for protection, I assume...but no instructions as to how to remove this film, and 3. and most important there is a warning label inside the pot warning against using the cooker on a propane fueled ""turkey cooker"". This was NOT mentioned in the description of the item. My main purpose of having this item was to use it outdoors on such a heating unit. I have not received an answer yet saying why I can't heat the item in this way. 4. Item is made in China and I wish it weren't...I don't trust that it will last."
5,Immensely enjoyable!,"This gay romance story is definitely a class by itself. It is witty, unique and strangely wise. Keegan, Valentino and the side characters are marvellously created, each one vivid and memorable even the so called ""bad guys"". There are moments of poignancy even if these are ""stories"" within the story itself, intelligently reminding the reader of society's cruelty towards gay love. Do yourself a favor and get this book. Meanwhile I look forward to the next effort from this talented writer."
1,It would have been great...,"This wiring harness would have been great if it fit my car, but I drive a 2007 Kia Rondo, and this wiring harness (KA02B) doesn't fit."
2,Does not fit vehicle,"This KA02B is listed to fit 2002 Kia Spectra. Manufacturer web site also lists it for this model year. However, the harness does not fit and is very different from the factory connector.P.S. After looking more closely at pictures of different connectors, anyone with a 2002 Spectra needs part number KA01B, which is listed by the manufacturer as ""1995 and up Kia""."
5,FAN-freaking-TASTIC!,OMG!! SO GOOD! I loved Wanda's snark and sarcasm. Brilliant characters and wonderfully written. I look forward to reading more of Lani's work.
3,It's OK,"""Time off for good behavior"" is definitely different, I give it that.It starts out like your typical romance novel, down-on-her-luck heroine meets handsome hero.But Wanda is just too passive for me, never standing up for herself, just running to the next savior. When she's threatened by her ex husband, she never thinks about getting a gun to protect herself or anything, she just takes shelter somewhere else. She's just too much of a damsel in distress for me, depending on virtual strangers to take her in.She's got a mouth on her, that's for sure, just no actions to follow it up with.And then there's the missing romance...not that I like my protagonists to be going at it like rabbits, but a little sex is OK. I like more than ""We did it 3 times"" as a description.Overall, I was disappointed because the story starts out very interesting. Unfortunately it then loses steam and limps along, with a kind of 12-step program for the protagonist that didn't make much sense to me."
1,UGH!,"I was totally desperate for a chick lit read and picked up this book because it got such good reviews from other reviewers.My question is - did we read the same book?The lead character Wanda seemed to have serious anger management issues and sounded like some scotch-swigging, ranting lunatic. I mean, I really hated this character. I could not find one good thing about her. I am pretty sure that is not what the author had in mind.She words ""sue"" appears at least 50 times in the first 50 pages and Wanda sounds like all she wants to do is get even with everyone (now that she can't beat the crap out of them).I hated, hated this book. If there would have been a negative rating, I would have given it.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
1,time off for good behavior,the plot was completely predictable. the heroine had the self conscious potty mouth of a 14 year old who has just learned the really bad swear words.good news? the book was free.
5,"Okay, I'm in love with Walter","I've re-read this book several times now. Lani Diane Rich is a master of romantic comedy and the offbeat heroine. For those of us who are tired of reading ultra-perfect female heroines, Wanda's a breath of fresh air, slightly tinged with the scent of Scotch. It's hard for me to believe that other reviewers here never let go with a four-letter word when things aren't going well, and the author's willingness to go there with her character gives Wanda the feel of ""the real"".Any woman with a pulse (and a closet Jimmy Stewart fan,) will fall in love with Walter and his quirky smile, his protectiveness, and his obvious love for an imperfect woman. The secondary characters are excellent, the story draws you in, and before you know it, you're reading it again.Great book. I truly enjoyed it. Lani Diane Rich, YOU don't write fast enough ;-)."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I love Lani Diane Rich's books usually, but I strongly recommend a pass on this one. The heroine is annoying and --worse in my view -- becomes boring after a bit. She is so self-centered and self-absorbed that I was wishing Walter would just give up on her and find someone better. I also found his attraction to her unbelievable. I finally put it down half way through, totally disinterested in the fate of these two. In fact, the only thing that kept me reading to the half-way point was the great dialogue of the secondary characters. Ms. Rich has written some terrific books since this one; stick to those and give this one a miss!"
5,Loved the book,It was more than a love story it was a life story. I don't know why it took me so long to find this author but I'm glad I finally did.
4,Worth a Try,"I got the free kindle edition, and it would've been worth paying for. It starts out in the vein of feisty females in absurd situations, but turns into a journey of self-discovery, without the strong female turning into wimp. It's not quite a rom-com, and although there's a strong romantic thread. It's more about a woman coming to terms with the choices she's made, and who she is, surly attitude and all. It's a fast read, but has a lot more substance than I expected.This is exactly why I take a chance with free kindle editions; it makes me want to read more by this author."
4,I'm not a huge fan of chic lit,"or any book written in the first person, but i did enjoy this book. The heroine was flawed, which i liked, but the hero was a saint, which I didn't quite believe. Oh, don't get me wrong, Walter is a man any woman would want, but the big question is WHY did he want Wanda? Even so, I thought the book was better than average."
1,"This book is a ""must pass""","I can't believe people are actually raving about this book. I was so offended by the inappropriate language that I could not possibly enjoy the experience of reading the story. The main character is acting like she is 3, rather than 32. This is hardly destined to be a classic and I would not recommend it to anyone who has any literary taste."
1,Didn't read,"First of all I didn't read the book, so I'm not reviewing the content. The problem is the cover fonts. When an author's byline is much more prominent than the book title, I'll reject the book immediately unless it was written by an author with a large following. That is not the case with this book."
2,OK when it works,"I bought this DVD player hoping for a decent, reliable machine that could play DVD's and MP3's. The remote is layed out very poorly, and the on-screen user interface to play MP3's is severly lacking. It had trouble playing MP3's on the last 70 tracks (of 144 tracks) of my MP3 CD's, and the device only uses 6-8 characters to display a title. My pet peave is that the power button is manual only, so I can't turn it on or off with the remote. But otherwise the DVD player seemed to work fine. The picture and sound were decent. HOWEVER, after about 1.5 months of use, it simply stopped working for no apparant reason...What a hassle.If you're a gambler, don't care about how it plays MP3's, and want a decent priced DVD player, then go for it. Otherwise, I would recommend some other DVD players out there that are more reliable..."
2,What a waste of good money!,"What a disapointment! Love the idea of the Karaoke. Ran out and brought Karaoke disc's and microphone only to be totally let down. No graphics on screen. Volume teribble!Three days after that the DVD player would not work start playing a movie all of a sudden it just paused, now all we get is black & white pictures and constant rolling of the picture. Tried all the instructions from the troubleshooting guide still nothing! of course all this happens after the warranty is up!"
2,Decent DVD player but shortcomings are too much,"Bought this DVD player a couple of days ago, nice features, lots of connections in the back incl. optical connection. There are lots of useful buttons on front including a shuttle dial, and you can change pitch. However, first movie stopped about an hour into it and would not continue to play. Had to turn off machine and back on again to get it to play. Did the same on several other DVD's that I know to be good. Unit runs HOT, smell of ""hot electronics/plastic"" wafts through air as it plays. There is no power button on remote so you have to press the power button on unit each time, very inconvenient. Remote is laid out rather poorly so navigating through menus can be difficult. MP3 recognition is flaky. In short, I highly recommend going either with RCA or a different brand. GE is bottom of the barrel for Thomson Consumer Electronics, and it shows."
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited that I found the GE1101P at such a great price at Wally World (Wal-Mart). I don't usually buy electronics from a store like that, but I took my chances. The player had all the options that I was looking for, so I purchased one. Took it out of the box and hooked it up only to find out that the shuttle did not open. I boxed it up, hassled with the lovely service people at Wally World and took my chances with another one. Hooked that one up and started watching a movie. Half way through the movie I started hearing a clicking sound that sounded like the DVD was bouncing up and down as it spun. I am thinking about returnng it, but a little gun-shy at buying another DVD player. I guess I should just look at it as I am getting what I paid for it."
1,Didn't Work at All,Much to my dismay I bought this player took it home and plugged it in and found that nothing worked. The display was dimmed and none of the remote functions or front panel functions did ANYTHING. Luckily I got a full-refund. Buyer beware.
4,Great unit for the price,The Karaoke function works great! It plays MP3 files which makes it a 10 disc changer! It gives you a work out as you have to get up to turn on the power intially before the remote control can be used.
1,Not a good buy,Have this machine. Much to my disappointment it was not able to handle the Dual Layer DVD. Just told me it could not find the disc. Tried with two different DVD's.
3,Good Low End DVD,This is my first DVD and I didn't want to spend too much money. The picture quality is very nice but the unit had problems playing audio CD's. It would stop playing in the middle of a song and would appear to lock up. I would have to turn the unit off and back on in order to eject the CD. I am hoping that the problem is due to slight moisture since I took it right out of the box and hooked it up.The remote that is included is not very user friendly and took some time to get used to. The arrow keys that are used to maneuver around are towards the bottom of the remote but the Enter button is toward the middle.All in all I am somewhat happy with the unit even though I had problems playing audio CD's.
4,Lackluster MP3 playback,"Everything works fine on this machine as advertised. However, it's MP3 playback is selective. On one of my MP3 discs with 129 songs, it only recognizes and plays 29 songs. On another disc it only recognizes and plays 8 out of 97 songs! What a rip! I use the same burn program for all MP3s (Nero Burning 4.0). If there was some way to fix this problem it would be most welcome. I downloaded the MP3s off the Internet, so perhaps some were encoded with codecs the GE1101 doesn't understand. In that case, one fix might be to convert all my MP3s back to wave files, reconvert them back to Mp3s using a popular codec (Windows Media Player, etc.), then reburn them. Tedious, but worth a try."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"I purchased this DVD player as a Christmas gift for my family in December of 2001. By June of 2002 (6 months later) it was no longer under warrenty, and it no longer worked. I called customer service and was told they could replace it for $50. If I had $50 more to spend on a DVD player I would have bought another brand to begin with. I wrote a letter to their review board in hopes of getting a better resolution. It has been 4 months since I wrote the letter, and I still have not heard back from them. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this product!"
4,"Overall great product, but misleading packaging","I've had this dvd player for a long time now (probably about 4 years or so) and it works great. It was cheap at the time i bought it considering all of the features. It still works like new even after 4 years of use, and I practically never turn it off because I'm way too lazy to go up to the thing to press power. It does have some bad things about it though. Like the fact the remote doesn't have a power button kind of pis*es me off. But oh well. Also, it lets customers believe that it's a karaoke machine, when really you can only plug in a mic and sing along, but not play cd+g. It really should say that somewhere in the box or the manual, but still, for the money, that's really all you can expect."
4,filter case,The case was good ecept that it doesn't work with the older type 404 filter motor. Which is the cases that usually fail. I was able to cut the tabs on the edges and make it work so it turned out ok.
1,Hated it!,"I so despised this book, I wondered why I kept reading it--must be a death wish or something. I paid good money dammit and I wanted it to be good. It wasn't. Where to start.Shallow characters, totally unbelievable story line TERRIBLE climactic ending---I read the first half of the book and was going to toss in trash, but decided to read the last 30 or so pages. Well, THEN I threw in the trash. Seriously, could not in good conscious give to anyone or donate anywhere. Don't know when I felt so strongly about a book before.Evidently, Bentley Little is a hit or miss author and I just have happened to read a couple of his misses. I have ""The House"" and will try to get through that one, and depending on the outcome will see if there are to be anymore.Mr. Little is a prolific writer and a fairly famous one. Is it just me? Am I the square peg? So many readers praise him HIGHLY. I thought I ""got"" him, evidently I don't."
2,Couldn't even finish it.,"Bentley Little is hit or miss. I had heard and read reviews saying this book was one of his better. Nope. At least I didn't think so. The characters were pitifully shallow and not well hashed out. The story was in your face ""I hate insurance policies"". No subtleness whatsoever. There were no real scares which is abnormal for a B Little novel. BL hates insurance which is obvious. He also hates big stores i.e. Wal-Mart as The Store proves. These two novels reflect his detest toward things in life but that's where they end in similarities. The Store was much better paced, better characters, better overall story. The Policy was crapola. Sorry BL. Better luck next time."
2,Predictable Virtues...and Flaws,"I'm a Bentley Little junkie. I know it's not good for me, know I should be spending my time in more elevated pursuits, but I just can't help it. I'm hooked.""The Policy"" reflects all the predictable virtues and flaws of Little's other books. Virtues? Over-the-top story telling (Little has no shame, bless him), intriguing plot and delightful satire (here of insurance companies; see other Little novels for the spearing of homeowner associations and megastores, among others). Alas, the predictable flaw is present as well: an ending that simply will not allow the reader to suspend disbelief. The ending of ""The Policy"" is Little's most ludicrous ever, as our heros and heroine navigate through the maze of the sinister insurance company and the evil critter at its heart.But never mind. Be it predictable virtues or predictable flaws, Little never disappoints."
5,Too Close for Comfort!,"Mr. Little may be accused of following a formula, but that is exactly why I read every one of his books! No different than Clive Cussler for example, or the rock band AC/DC. You know what you're getting!I love the way he gradually increases the perversion of the insurance salesman and his weird policies. And I love the heroes and their fight against the insurance agent. Bentley is good at adding perverted twists to the bad guys a little at a time and I'll just about bet that he has had a bad experience or two with insurance. Like he did with homeowners associations in The Association, he hits on a rather sensitive and somewhat true example of our American society. It seems we need insurance for just about everything and he takes that need to the extreme. Makes you wonder what all that fine print really says on your insurance policies! Well done!"
3,Not Bentley's Best,"I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this book, as I am a big Little fan, as many are. I quickly jumped into the book, and loved the character development, could easily relate to the Horror of dealing with insurance. I also enjoyed how the main character rebuilt his life. It was all going along quite nicely, until the horrid ending. I mean I have to say it was the worst ending of any of his books.The ending did not take away the enjoyment of the book, and I can give the book a thumbs up by a narrow margin. I only hope that someday Bentley will write a book as brilliant as The Store or The Ignored, those are classics. The Policy unfortunately is not!"
2,More annoying than scary,"I'm a Bentley Little fan and I bought this book because of all the rave reviews I read here but I have to say I was quite disappointed. I love scary books and have read several of Bentley Littles, The Store, The Town and The House, which were good books. This book went nowhere. It just kept repeating itself. And I agree with one of the other reviewers who pointed out the things in the story that ended up going nowhere and had nothing to do with the story, such as the ""haunted"" guest room and the x-wife spotting in Tucson. I kept waiting for something to happen with her. She ends up dieing and that was that. I didn't feel frightened of this insurance guy, just annoyed. I found myself speed reading near the end just to get through it. This definitely was not one of his better books and I would not recommend it to anyone who likes to be scared because like I said, it's more annoying than scary."
2,The Policy,"My first experience with Bentley Little was The Collection of short stories. I enjoyed that a lot, but this. I'm speechless. Dull......Annoying....Check it out of your library, don't waste money on buying it. It was entertaining, but not great. It just seemed to get more and more ridiculous. And the end, of my gosh, the end. Boring...lame...no action. Overall, entertaining, but not worth buying or reading again...or going out of your way to read at all."
2,Broke during installation,"Package arrived with wrapping that looked like it was bought and returned from a hardware/home diy store and then sat in the warehouse for a few decades. Product looked okay, though. The screw holes sheared during installation, and I returned the product and received a full refund."
4,B. Fleischmann - A Choir Of Empty Beds,"Warm, fuzzy IDM with a hint of shoegazing... it's gotta be Morr Music! B. Fleischmann, this time on the Stateside label Fuzzy Box, unleashes A CHOIR OF EMPTY BEDS. Even though it's an early album in Fleischmann's career (listen to how ""It's All So"" and ""Play the Big A"" sound as if they might be the same song), it shows the promise that would emerge in his later albums. But with the melodic see-saw of ""Open End,"" the album begins to open up, and with the thrumming percussion of ""Buzz,"" things really start to get interesting. ""Ircam"" goes into a minor key, but ""Chad F. (The Tick and Sax Mix)"" trades back into a jazz-based ambience. The hidden track after ""Good Bye"" also shares in this jazzy vibe. Nice!"
5,Brilliant,"Nothing in IDM or any other electronic music subgenre compares to the emotion evinced on this album. Choir of Empty Beds is Fleischman's best. Pop Loops was a prelude to this album. Welcome Tourist (I'm surprised they don't carry his other albums here) is a 2 CD set, and a bit more stripped down then this, with live intruments and vocals in stilted English."
3,"a beautiful read, but...","Alan Moorehead's Gallipoli is prose at its finest. this is beautifully written, and the scenes of battle come to life, as well as the everyday life of the allied soldier. However this book is now over 50 years old and much new information has come to light, particularly on the Turkish side. Also, many of the battles fought themselves, such as the battles at Krithia, Kum Kale, The Farm, The Nek, etc... on and on, are either completely ignored or scaled down and condensed so that you truly learn nothing about them. For a beginner who wishes to study Gallipoli this book is fine. For its superb writing style and life like narrative this book is superb. However for those wishing to learn the whole story of the Gallipoli battle read Les Carlyon's Gallipoli or Robert Rhodes James Gallipoli. Both of these books are excellent and well written, and both cover far more of the campaign as a whole then does Moorehead's book."
2,Where were the Turks?,"Although this book does an excelent job of telling the allied side of the battle, the reader is often left wondering what the Turks were doing the whole time. If Moorhead had given equal time to the Turkish army/soldiers/generals then this would be unquestionably one of the finest narratives of WWI. As it is the reader is often left to wonder were all the allied casulties are coming from because there is hardly a Turk in sight."
5,Antother vote for 5 stars,"The other 5 star reviewers got it right,in my opinion. I just finished it and think it was very well written. I have previously read a little about Gallipoli,saw the movie (not bad), and have read a previous Moorehead book on Darwin so I decided to give it a try. His writing is so interesting that I just ordered the Russian Revolution book by him."
3,Gallipoli by A. Morehead,Found the book more a legal defense of the actions of the Allied commanders than a historical work. Not my favorite type of reading.
5,None Better,"I have had the Hitachi drill for over four years and this battery replacement is my first required. The original two batteries that came with it have been excellent so far. I have used this drill and batteries for many projects and they are great. The other original battery is still working but for some reason one just gave up during drilling 4"" dia. holes for venting exhaust fans on a new house I'm building. I had used the batteries as a ""tag-team"" till one just wouldn't take a charge anymore. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR EVER! The battery takes a quick charge (about 20 min.) and depending on the work you put it to it will last for about 20 minutes of heavy almost constant loading and much longer times for lighter work. I would recommend Hitachi drills and this type of battery for any medium duty work. It isn't ""cheep"" but, in my opinion, worth the cost."
3,Convenient Kong Stuffer but...,"My dogs LOVE the taste of this PB Stuff 'N Paste and I like and appreciate the convenience of being able to add PB to their Kongs with no mess whatsoever. That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs."
