2,Easy to install but unreliable and unpredictable,"10-minute install, decent instructions. Works most of the time, but occasionally the door sensor will not be triggered by an open door. My main complaint is that when the door is opened using an external keypad (radio frequency), the sensor is not triggered till the door closes and then the door will open 15 minutes after IT IS CLOSED! This completely defeats the purpose of the timer. Almost a good product but it has a critical flaw!"
2,Does not work as advertised,"After mounting both pieces, one on the door, the other on wall, I attempted to program the unit with the three position switch. This switch is supposed to allow the user to select one of three times for the door to close. The switch has no effect on the time what so ever, the unit closes the door after 2 minutes. An email to the company has gone without response."
4,Finally I don't have to worry about leaving the garage door open!,I searched a lot for an automatic door closer and wanted something simple and inexpensive.This one is perfect. Installation took about a half hour and I was taking my time following instructions. Very easy do it yourself project and it works perfectly. Very pleased with it!
2,Skylink Security-not!,"I have a two door garage and purchased two GT-100A units. The installation wasn't bad, except for the flimsy design of the wire set screws, they wouldn't tighten sufficiently to hold the wires securely.But the biggest problem was that the single-wide door would open by itself. Now the purpose of these systems is security, and this one does just the opposite. I finally tossed this GT-100A unit and went back to the old button. Then about a month ago, when I was getting ready to leave for work, the double-wide door opened by itself; this was a first. I left a message at a neighbor's house to watch the door for me (they work from home often) I was so paranoid.So now I'm shopping around for another system. It's scary that you can get this reaction from the same model operating on two doors controlled with the same (Sears) model of garage door opener."
1,Absolutely The Worst,"I had high hopes for this... After installing, it was nothing but trouble. The remote sensor would not communicate to the base everytime. And worst of all, this thing would actually open the garage door a little while after I closed it and left the garage. I got a new one under warranty and it did the same thing.Forget this one!"
4,garage monitor,"very easy to install, ease of setting the time. and convient to use, i had to hard wire it the clip would not work for solid wire."
2,Doesn't work with every garage door.,I chose this closer because it is the easiest to install and least expensive. It didn't work. After numerous messages with Skylink trying to figure out what is wrong they finally told me it will not work with my Odyssey 1000 Garage Door Opener.This was not mentioned in anything I was able to read in advance and it is not mentioned in the instruction sheet. Because it took a while to get the extra adapter that is required for some doors I am now unable to return it either.I would not recommend this Skylink unless you have a Sears or similar door.
2,Works for a while,"Like most others found, you have to mount the receiver pretty close to the sensor. I decided to leave the original switch and just mount this one by the door. I actually bought two as I have two doors. I thought they worked great, but eventually one of the sensors went bad and I had to replace. Now the other one has gone bad, at least that's what I'm guessing and have decided to buy another brand."
2,The Most Pithy Documentary in the World,"If you know anythin about politics, and are interested in the INDIVIVUAL congresspeople that have served, than this is not the documentary for you. In by far the most shallow documentary I have seen, this movie glosses over entire eras (almost all of the 1920's, the 80's, the 90's, the late 40's), and speaks of only about 10 congressman in the 20th century. Not only that, but Ken Burns seems to want to prove that the congress is more insignificant than we think. He talks at length about Everett Dirksen, who was a senator, and spends four minutes on each decade, and RARELY goes into specific congressman. This is incredibly pithy, no Newt Gingrich, no John Nance Garner, barely any congressman. This documentary despises profiles of interesting people and love long, pedantic descriptions of buildings."
4,good roots rock,"have seen Rusty play in Indiana and album shows off his roots rock band. Likable guy, likable songs, good snare drum crack , and music that would make Petty/Mellencamp fans happy. I am."
5,book worm,great book just like the tv show glad to be able to find these books in fact i found all of the books if you like the tv show you will enjoy the books
2,I can't stand it when companies do this,"This product is unjustifiably overpriced. The manufacturer only includes one pen with this product, when everyone knows most children would be playing with a parent or sibling, then they market extra pens for sale at a cost higher than the original product. I think it's shameful."
4,Power Booster,I read reviews before buying this and they all stated how they noticed a difference in power and gas mileage. I definitely saw a difference in the power but no difference in the gas mileage.
1,Bogus Software; good booklet,"I received the Wine Cellar System as a Christmas present. It consists of a very limited ""database"" for keeping track of wines, a folder with some fancy parchment paper, and a booklet on wine cellaring. The booklet is very interesting but should cost about $10. This is most lame program I have ever seen and the publishers should be ashamed to offer something like this. It has no preloaded content and is nothing more than could be easily created in Excel or Access. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Software is awful,"I agree with the earlier reviewer. I was shocked at how simple the software is. The entry page for each wine is fairly comprehensive, but if you want to print a full list of wines, the program sets about half a dozen fields set fields which cannot be customized. Whether you want those fields or not, that's what you are stuck with. Also annoying, the software does not allow you to ""minimize"" the program. You have to ""quit"" the program to look at something else on your computer. This makes it impossible to easily reference other electronic materials (like the Wine Spectator's web site) or cut and paste from different source while inputting data into the wine software. It's like they never bothered to update software that was developed 10 years ago."
3,Who (the hell) is on first? (Lacan's Noontide),"Zupancic's done what has been long been in need of doing--exposition and analysis of Nietzsche's Noontide. Brilliant, terrorizing de-facto emasculations by fashionable apparatchiks of the international academic slave guild, --all written by a woman, and an attractive one at that (see rear cover); no small rarity given tendencies toward drawing conlusions on FN from knee-jerk bourgeois paroxysms ""Oh no! He said to stay in the kitchen? Women can write stupid suburban novels too! We shall bury the Overman!""In any case, if you are not big on continental thought and Lacanian psychoanalysis, the serving portions are roughly as follows: 1/4 Nietzsche, 3/4 Lacan, with Zizek barnstorming like a psychotic cross be-dressed Viking and quoting Vertigo et. al, and Noontide as fulcrum and catalyst. Diamond if you please, Gems if you don't."
4,got the jobe done,This is a great product that makes your work easier. Make sure you make holes in wall first and install it then mount your hot water heater. Manafacturer could have put some extra pieces more in package for the price they charge
2,Not Appropriate for Most Installations,"I had the authorized Bosch Aquastar installation professional survey my home for installaion of this water heater. He took one look at the AQ3 and said it wasn't appropriate. For one thing, Bosch mandates that the exhaust be constructed of 4"" stainless steel. This equipment is 3"" and the main exhaust vent pipe is aluminum. In some climates, the fumes react with moisture in the air and form acid (think acid rain). The acid and water accumulate in this corrugated pipe and drip back into the unit. This means that the main vent will fail, and then cause the water heater to fail.Unless you live in the high desert, don't use this installation kit. I'm returning mine."
4,"""The Man-Stopper""(!)","Sessions was trainer of military dogs (incl 'Heller' who received Lassie Medal for heroism), search and rescue dogs, senior editor of Dog Fancy International and founder of ""Canine College""; how to select and train a watchdog, boundry training, with special chapters on poison-proofing, search and rescue and training ""The Man-Stopper"". Not filled with a lot of fluff or digressions about general dog care. Practical, hands-on applications."
3,Good general knowledge but too detailed except for ocean tow,"Read and reviewed this because I teach the US Coast Guard Captain Course. Was excellent for general knowledge and terminology, but too extensive for the average layman looking to pass the towing part of the USCG exam. I have abbreviated this to a readable issue. A good book for a library or the towing enthusiast seeking more than basic skills. I now own several."
2,Listen before you buy!,"I bought this album because it was supposed to be a classic within the industrial genre. I was really disapointed, to me it sounds like dated synth-pop, typical for the 80-ish, with only a couple of decent songs ('Kinda I want to' is one)."
5,WOW,"I am an avid fan of Trent Reznor and I firmly feel that Nine Inch Nails are the best band I have ever heard. Out of all of the NiN albums, this is my favourite. My message is pure and simlpe. Buy it now."
5,PHM is an amazing collection cool beats and great lyrics,"NIN is indeed an industrial band. But they didn't become one until ""Broken"" was released. What you will find on ""Pretty Hate machine"" is a great New Wave band. But don't perceive this as bad thing. if the only reason that you would consider NIN is because it's supposed to industrial, then you are just stupid. This album isn't about being industrial. in fact, it almost sounds like dance music. But this is good. Every song on this album is great. the electronic music is very cool,and Trent has a remarkable singing voice, but the cornerstone of this album is the amazing lyrics. The most notable songs on the album are ""Ringfinger"", ""That's What I Get"", and the incredible piano tragic ballad, ""Something I can Never have""."
4,This one kicked it off,"This is techno after a long line of coke. The first song, Head Like a Hole, is probably my favorite song NIN ever did. Terrible Lie is probably my 2nd choice of this album (a distant 2nd.) This album is good, but kind of soft. It one of those albums that if your in the mood for it, you think it is the best album ever, but if your not, it will get on your nerves. Honestly, the album is worth buying just for Head Like a Hole. This album blends together with their album Broken to give us The Downward Spiral, which is, in my opinion, by far their best overall album."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! THE 2010 REMASTER IS WHAT YOU WANT.,"Anyone looking to pick up NIN's debut LP, Pretty Hate Machine, needs to steer clear of this fraud. Universal is trying to capitalize on Trent Reznor's recent success--namely an Oscar-winning movie score (The Social Network), as well as his scoring work on the upcoming American versions of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. No remastering has been done on this album. Do not be fooled by this. Trent himself has warned his fans publicly to avoid this release. Buy the original or buy the 2010 remaster, but not this one. The 2010 Remaster also contains a bonus track, the B-side ""Get Down, Make Love""."
4,Great Debut album,This...I think is the best album of the 80s...Coming out in 89...with its techno sound it is so different from other bands. It pulls a listener in a totally new alternative music group. It has the hard and the soft music for a variety of listeners. It is definately the way to go if u are a first time NiN fan. Check it out...
5,The original NiN,"Absolutely the greatest Industrial album ever made. This is the album that started it all for Trent, and helped define the Industrial music genre. A must have for any NiN fan."
3,WARNING: Good Album (not great),"This is Trent's first album. It's ok. I bought this after hearing The Downward Spiral and I went and bought every other full legnth release that NIN did. Its not a bad album, theres lots of diversity, but it sounds very 80's. One thing I dont like about 80's music is its bad bass. If you love the way NIN makes your house fall apart, you wont find that here. Even it Pretty Hate Machine's ""loudest"" tracks its still pretty tame compared to TDS and the Fragile.However, I don't regrett the purchase. This album dosen't have any bad songs, save Down In It (that synth line is so irritating). Also, Trent's voice has defidantly gotten some practice over the years, as it's at its least powerful on this album.In other words, an ok release that you should buy if your into that 80's style synth pop with a NIN edge, but if you like the way TDS or the Fragile rivits you with its sheer power, then look elsewhere."
4,melodic industrial,I remember when I bought this album in the early 90's. I loved the hard music mixed with melodic touches. I dont like some of the real dark songs on this album. There is enough cool songs that you can skip the bad ones. I dont own any other nin albums because of the real dark overtones. This is the best nin album to own. Trent made industrial have a pop sence. stand out songs above it and of course head like hole.
1,Pointless if you have the original album and released against Trent Reznor's wishes,"5 stars for the music, 1 star for this particular re-issue.If you own the original edition of this album as issued by TVT Records and later re-issued by Rykodisc then there is no point in purchasing this release. The music has not been remastered and you will be purchasing something you already own.Trent Reznor has asked NIN fans to avoid this release. In late 2010 Trent collaborated with UMe to release a remastered version of Pretty Hate Machine - you can easily find that release here on Amazon.Pretty Hate Machine: 2010 Remaster"
1,BUY 2010'S REISSUE/REMASTER INSTEAD!!,"Trent Reznor remastered and reissued his debut album ""Pretty Hate Machine"" last year, now for some strange reason it's been reissued again. NOT by Trent Reznor who has no say in this!! He has even publicly stated his disapproval of this reissue.That's all this is it's just a reissue, it hasn't been remastered so it still sounds like it's 1989 original, the artwork is more or less the same, 2010's reissue had complete new artwork done by Rob Sheridan and came in a fold out digi pack as opposed to the original jewel case. Nor does this version have the bonus track that was included in 2010's reissue which is a cover of Queen's ""Get Down Make Love"".So while the songs are great and the album itself is brilliant and an important part of Nine Inch Nails history, this is not the version to be buying. This is the link to last years remastered versionPretty Hate Machine: 2010 Remaster"
5,Trent Reznor is purely a musical genius.,"I love NIN. I have never been shy about admitting that. I bought this way back in 89, when I was but a young thing who liked pretty much everything with a beat. But now my tastes have matured, and thankfully my appreciation for Trent and his gift has not waned. This man is pure talent, mixing interesting samples, haunting lyrics, and that voice which calls out in only that way that Trent can. ""Something I Can Never Have"" is one of my all time favorite NIN tracks, as it captures the essence of this whole recording. I feel this music in the depths of me, every note, every beat. This is the quintiessential NIN album, where the beauty and pain began. It is not as lusty and angry as ""Broken"" or even ""Downward Spiral"", but it still conveys each premise with the spirit in which Trent meant them."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I've listened to NIN for awhile, mainly Broken and The Perfect Drug, and I've heard Pretty Hate Machine quite a few times as well. I know, it's practically nothing, but Pretty Hate Machine was a disappointment comming from the ingenious Trent Reznor. On this CD, all it sounds like is weak electronica/almost dance(shudder) beats, and Reznor whining. The only good songs on here are Head Like A Hole and Terrible Lie, which happen to be the first two tracks. Of course, if you're a die-hard NIN fan, this CD is definitely for you. But personally, I enjoy bull-in-a-china-shop type of music, if you know what I mean. If you listen to heavy/thrash metal, this CD is NOT for you."
4,My first NIN cd ever owned...,"Pretty Hate Machine is my first NIN cd ever owned... I first heard it when I shopping at a store called Na-Na on Polk Street in San Francisco and it just totally blew me away... After hearing it I immediately went to their counter and asked who it was, then went directly to Tower and bought it...What blew me away was NIN's lyrics/music capturing angst so perfectly and angrily... From beginning to end it kept my attention... and still does...My three favorite tracks are (in order):- Head Like a Hole- Terrible Lie- Something I can Never HaveThough I enjoy them all at different levels of angst fullfilling satisfaction...and to any industrial/goth djs, this cd is a must for your collection to mix into any set, including dance parties - DJ Dakini-NYC aka Savannah Skye..."
3,OVERRATED,Reznor is no genius. Some songs are good but when did this guy become the next Lou Reed (look him up kiddies). Watered down industrial made safe for the masses.
3,umm... its not that good,"ah yes, industrial for the trendy at heart. This is weak, stupid dreck. Trent Reznor cannot sing and when he attempts any emetion, it sounds forced and pathetic. He is no songwriter either. ""I hurt myself today....."" WTF How can I take this seriously? Dont even call this industrial, its pop music. Get Tactical Neural Implant or Hardwired by Front Line Assembly instead."
2,This is breakthrough?!,"You know, there are alot of NIN singles I really like. And when I read some of the reviews for this album, I thought ""Wow, this'll be great."" So I went out and bought it, listened to it, and stopped it after ""Sin"". Besides the opening track and maybe ""Sin"", the rest of the songs really aren't that great. The beat in ""Terrible Lie"" reminds me of ""Closer"", however the actual song is alot worse. ""Down With It"" would be decent, but Trent had to ruin it by trying to rap, which really kills the song IMO. Anything after that really didn't catch my attention. Almost fell asleep during ""Sanctified"" and ""Something I Can Never Have"" so honestly, I can't really see where this is some breakthrough CD, nor can I see where I could even call it good. Maybe it gets better after ""Sin"" but my thoughts are if five out of the opening seven songs aren't that great, it won't matter how good the remaining three songs are. It won't make the CD worth it."
1,March of the Capitalist Pig,"Agnst? Try Nirvana, the The, The Cure, Frontline Assembly. You won't find it here. Anger? Certainly not existential anger; more like a tantrum to get attention (and $$$). The lyrics are silly and manipulative.NIN, along with bands like Bush, is the Spice Girls of what used to be ""alternative"" music. Inoffensive as background music, not much more."
3,"Depending on where you are coming from,you'lllikeitorhateit","If you are discovering Nine Inch Nails with the FRagile, pretty hate machine, might interest you in a biographical way, but it probably won't interest you musically. If however, you got into NIN on downward spiral, and haven't already bought this, its worth getting. Head like a hole, remains one of NIN's strongest songs, along with That's what i get. A lot of the music is specific to a time period, and i found myself kind of laughing nostalgically how Trent was rap/rhyming on Down in it. Its great for its time period as a breakthrough album, but if you are not a hardcore NIN fan, there really isn't that much to get off on. But that's the paradox of being an innovator, you end up blocking out the value of your past achievements in favor of what's new."
5,1989..,"1989, the year Trent Reznor got pissed enough to write a masterpiece of anger and resentment about a girl.A girl.One single chick...it's a masterpiece.And it sounds like it could debut tomorrow..."
3,Has not been Remastered.,"Pretty Hate Machine (Shm)This Japaneses release has not been remastered. This is a SHM-CD, the plastic material is a little cleaner allowing a better laser signal return."
4,It's A Terrible Lie To Say This Bad Album !,"Nine Inch Nails(NIN) debut album sounds like Depeche Mode that plays heavy rock. It's not a bad at all. Guitars and keyboards plays well together. In my opinion, Standoutracks are Head Like A Hole, Terrible Lie and Sin. These songs belongs NIN classic songs especially Sin. Many choruses are carefully made and it's joy to listen to these parts. Solo sections are also terrific! This album is a pretty dark but I like dark albums.Singer does his job fine! If you want to start listen NIN music you can begin Pretty Hate Machine. Many critics likes also this album for excemple All Music Guide's ctitic gives this album five stars. Do you know what Nine Inch Nails means? When Jesus Christ was cruxified about 2000 years ago, soldiers who did that used nine inch nails. Finally, Listen this first and say after that your own opinion."
5,NIN hit the ground running.,"I remember back in the day, getting a tape of an EP that was being passed around. No one knew where it came from but everyone was listening to it. The songs were Head Like a Hole and Down In It from some guy called Nine Inch Nails. Soon it was being played in the industrial dance bars and then it exploded on MTV. All of the industrial kids were going crazy. It had taken the scene by storm. When Pretty Hate Machine came out we were amazed. NIN had captured a man's hatred of an ex-lover with all the pain and psychosis that we each felt about our exes. Never before had an album said ""I hate you!"" better than Pretty Hate Machine. This album is so original that not even NIN has been able to recreate the anger expressed on this album. If you only buy one Nine Inch Nails album buy this one."
5,My fave CD!,"This album is my fave CD by far of any NIN or other band's albums. I never get tired of this album and always listen to at least half of it a day: on the way to school, the way home, the way to and from practice, just drivin' around to various places.. I luv it! I like this album more than TDS, The Fragile, Broken, and the others!"
5,"Most ""synthetic"" album ever released by NIN.","Just about this entire album is Electronic Hard-Rock except for ""Something I Can Never Have"". ""Sin"" is the perfect song for a Halloween dance/prom for it's demonic,angry sound and so is ""Terrible Lie"".""Head Like a Hole"" is the perfect song for a ""Moshing"" concert . To make a long story short , Trent , EXCELLENT work !!!"
5,sounds for every emotion,"I bought this CD just about the day that it came out. From that day on, I became a devoted NIN fan. In my opinion, this is probably Trent's best work. However, that may be because this is the cd that turned me toward NIN as being my all-time favorite. Either way, it has terrific sounds and lyrics to match. Not a week has gone by since I got the CD (tape first actually = )), that I haven't listened to at least something off it. For me at least, listened to closely, each song on the CD seems to match a certain emotion. I don't know, it helped me get through a lot of mine. A definite must have, Trent is a recording genius. >>>>>ShadowSinner<<<<<"
5,way beyond 5 stars...,"Nine Inch Nails/Trent Reznor has proved to the world that they are one of the best damn bands there ever will be. I am AMAZED at the talent on this album. Possibly NIN best and most memorable album, I find I can't stop listening to it even after all these years. The lyrics are beyond brilliance and Trent's vocals are distinctive and exact. Buy this CD now.Highlights: Sanctified, Terrible Lie, Something I Can Never Have, Ringfinger, Kinda I Want To"
3,Edgy Electro-Pop-Rock,"Mixing Industrial music, the structure of pop music and some incredibly emotional lyrics is not easy, but Trent does it very well on Pretty Hate Machine.Admittedly, this record is horrendously 'poppy', at least in how it is structured, but the fact is that the music is still very good, although far more minimalist than his later works. The standout tracks are Head Like A Hole, Terrible Lie and Sin, all of which have emotional intensity and a great sound. Many other songs, for my taste, are too slow or too poppy but this record is still very enjoyable. If you have never heard NIN before, this is probably a good place to start.The electronics are at least remotely understandable (before he started being ultra avant-garde and experimental, which ruins some of the songs on later albums) and they do their purpose. However, one song (""Down In It"") is nothing less than a rip off of Skinny Puppy's ""Dig It."" The guitars are less thrashy than Broken's or The Downward Spiral's."
1,hah,"... All of this has been done before. This is not revolutionary. The only revolutionary thing that happened with this album is some industrial band finally sold out. Throbbing Gristle started this genre, not some ... like Reznor. If you want good industrial music, check out Foetus."
1,What's the point!,"No bonus tracks, or remastering. Trent Reznor, where are you at re-releasing this?"
3,It's okay but alot of it's just plain BORING!,"There are a few good songs, like Head Like a Hole, Terrible Lie, Sin, and Kinda I Want To, but the rest is boring keyboard-synth-pop. I got The Downward Spiral, Broken, Closer To God, and The Perfect Drug, then this and I was basically horrifed. It's not so bad i'd sell it or throw it away but even though it is from what 1989 it could be better more interesting, buy it and only listen to tracks 1,2,3,6,7."
5,Pretty Hate Machine,"This CD was in the shape described. It plays great,from the time of ordering until receiving it was very fast Super pleased!"
2,Shockingly boy-band-ish.,"I had a sabbatical from NIN since 95 or so, and only recently went back and gave everything of Trent's a fresh listen. It's amazing what the years can do; ""Pretty Hate Machine"" sounds not so far removed from the minor-key boy band stuff. Very, very weak, poor lyrics and most of the production is farmed out to old studio pros instead of Reznor going at it himself like he does these days. Only tracks for me are ""Head Like a Hole"" and ""Down in It,"" both muscular examples of tech-rock. Out of all NIN I personally recommend ""Broken""-- concise and to the point, never wears out its welcome."
4,this isnt industrial and this isnt pop or anything like pop,who in ...SATANS right mind would call this either industrial or POP...whomever mixed those together or even tried to define NIN as pop or industrial IS A FLAMING IDIOT....PHM lots of emotion...nto the greatest playing..but you have to give trent credit on what he did with what he had...'nuff said
2,A dare,"Yes, this album is classic and we owe Trent a lot for being a genuinely talented musician, but more so for being poppy enough to generate interest in other industrial acts.The 4 good songs on here are good for the mix.But I dare anyone (who isn't a hot as Trent) to get up and read these lyrics in a coffee shop.I just DARE you.See if the most pathetic loser in earshot doesn't laugh you off the stage.He gets better from here, but who knows if it was the practice or the Diva-Withdrawal that helped."
3,the begginning,"I have mixed feelings about this album. This album has some really heartfelt songs such as Something I Can Never Have and That's What I Get. But I feel like some of the major songs such as Head Like A Hole and the godawful Down In It don't really display anything much. To me, NIN was just Trent a bunch of nameless faces. Overrated would be an understatement. There are so many other talented bands in the underground that I wonder why NIN gets all the credit. I also happen to think Marilyn Manson is way more talented and Trent's subject matter is really kinda basic and you don't have to be in a depressed mood to listen to Manson as you do with NIN. This album is just average.."
3,A good beginning,"This is a good album, it has some dark and moody bits. It has some really good tracks, but it also has a lot of bubblegum synthpop. Down in it is annoying, Head like a hole was terribly overplayed, and also fairly repetitive and annoying. Terrible Lie, Sin, Ringfinger are all well written and less annoying than most. Get this album to be complete, listen to it to see the roots of a very good franchise of records, but It ranks behind Broken and Downward Spiral."
4,Gift,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son. He was excited to get this vinyl and has been very pleased with the purchase.
4,NIN as easy listening.,"Pretty Little Hate Machine is the only NIN album I can listen to on a regular basis. With the rest, I usually have to be in the mood to listen. I have to take out the headphones (the only way to appreciate Trent's work), sit down, and listen. Because you miss so much if you don't. But, with Pretty Little Hate Machine, I can pop it in my car and not lose the ""whole"" experience. Granted, this is probably NIN's most mainstream album, therefore an easier listen and probably the best start for new NIN fans. With songs like ""Head Like a Hole"" and ""Terrible Lie"", along with the rest, you can't go wrong."
5,Ballew Saw Review,My second order with Ballew. Very fast shipping. Exactly what I ordered and packaged very well. Will order again.
1,Ok.. one more time.. this is garbage..,"*sigh* I've listened to this again and again.. trying to find how people can like it.. and I can't.. it's horribly awful.. and I have a high tolerance for all music... bleh.. ""Dead Elvis"" is still one of my all-time fav cds out of hundreds.. but this cd is a HUGE disappoinment... Dirge is good.. for 2min.. then you just want it to end.. the songs all lack the nice deep groove the first album had.. this is randomchaos... hard to listen to.. and bad repeating vocals thrown in.. a few songs near the end start to be nice.. but run off and end quick... I bought this cd for $18 the day it was released.. then found it for $3 a few days later used... so now i have 2 poor copies.. (I felt bad for the used one) if you can get this cd for pocket change.. try it.. otherwise.. get Dead Elvis and hunt for better stuff... Death in Vegas has left the building.. d=\"
2,Ok.. I've decided..,"Well I've listened to the cd more and decided it isn't very good... Dead Elvis is an incredible cd.. and i don't know what happened to this one.. it's much shorter and less ""funky"" then previous DiV work.. Dirge is ok for about 2 or 3 minutes.. then it's annoying.. you'll be disappointed if you really liked Dead Elvis.. this cd just has nothing worth listening to for very long... oh well... d=\"
5,Brilliant,"I brought this when it first came out here and wasn't sure what to expect - it was described as gothic by the NME - so when i listened to it i was blown away. Dirge really is a great opening track, building up from a simple guitar line and a 'la la la' hook into a full blown rock mosh up! Soul Auctioneer is a great hip hop track and the two instrumentals are fantastic. Then comes another brilliant track - Aisha. The guitars, beats and Iggy's vocals really complement each other and rock out! The only two sub-standards here are Lever Street and Broken Little Sister. However, Aladdins Story is a fantastic gospel track and one of the best here. The album finishes with Neptune's City which envokes memories of the Chemical Brothers Private Psychedelic Reel and you come down off a musical high. This album is better than Dead Elvis in my opinion."
3,merely average,"Not really a cohesive album, but a collection of guest stars and noodling songs that never really go anywhere. I wouldn't call it bad, but nowhere near the quality of Dead Elvis, which was a GREAT album."
5,Oh dear god!,If this album where any better the Vatican and the DEA would have to ban it. I loved Dead Elvis but this one really is amazing - it's like a soundtrack to some kind of tripped out club off the coast of Spain. Thank you DIV!
2,Iggy Pop is the highlight of the album,"This album is hyped all over the world, but I'm still wondering why. I've listened to it over and over and it seems to me that Death In Vegas are having a lack of ideas. The songs are way too long and this results in boredom. Iggy Pop's voice on Aisha is terrific, but even Aisha gets boring after a few minutes. They've put a lot of noise in this record, but I'm afraid it is just to hide the weak spots. And there are plenty of those. It's a shame."
4,Happy 5yo,"My 5 year old son loves trains of all kinds. We have a bund of O and HO, which he does very well with. These trains are pretty durable and withstand a child acting out train stories.From an educational standpoint, my son has learned how to build his own tracks. Such has, when building something other than a simple circle, he has learned how to select the correct pieces to close the loop. He has also learned how to connect up the electrical bits, under my supervision.Only thing to watch for is the moving eyes and whistle. Of the 6 O gauge loco's from the Thomas set, Percy's whistle didn't work. It took me a while to get around to doing anything about it, so I dealt directly with Lionel who swapped it for me. But... The Percy I received in exchange had some issues with the eyes moving. But that was fixed by me."
1,Disappointing,"After receiving our Thomas Ready to Run set which didn't work, we received Percy in hopes it would work. It did for a short time. Started squeeking so we oiled it and now it doesn't work at all. Definately not worth the money. We want to get our money back!"
2,Had to return,"I gave this train to my grandson for Christmas. The wheels-?motor started squealling and stopping on the track shortenly after he started playing with it. I had to return the train and have still,after over 2 weeks, have not heard anything from the place where I purchased it. Makes me wounder about buying on line- no one to deal with such problems- just have to take a leap of faith to get it replaced."
3,The biggest icon in wrestling.,"This is an out of print Japanese CD featuring songs about the nWo. The songs were written and produced by Jimmy Hart. Only a few of these songs were actually used as the wrestler's entrance music. If you were a wrestling fan during the late '90s, you will remember the original ""nWo Theme"", ""nWo Wolfpack"" and ""Buff Daddy"". As for the rest of the songs, they may not be familiar, but they are still pretty entertaining. It's somewhat annoying that they have crowd noise in between the songs. I should also point out that the CD is only 31 minutes long."
1,Unusual,"If you are looking for names that are different or ethnically oriented, this book offers plenty of choices. If you are looking for ordinary or old-fashioned, there is a list that is repeated frequently. I, personally, didn't find this book useful."
2,Not as good as Harpoon on the Amiga,"For those of you who can remember back 6 years, there was a game on the Amiga called Harpoon. It came on a few floppy disks and had no facy 3D graphics and a dire AI, however, it was one of the most playable games I've ever played.When I bought Fleet Command my lowest expectation was they had just copied Harpoon. On playing the game I realised to my horror they had kept all the bad bits (rubbish AI) and removed all the handy GUI dialog boxs, amazing database, formation editor, huge campains, groups of planes, etc.I assume if I played this game some more it would grow on me, but I can't but help get frustrated when I compare it with a game from 6 years ago! (and fancy 3d graphics count for anything)"
1,My extremly critical review of Janes Fleet Command.,"This an extremly boring game. All you so is sit there for an hour or two and right click. Sometimes something exciting happens, but other than that do not get this game or you just have another forty-dollar dust collector!"
2,Action game - Not strategy,"This game reminded me of 'missle command' at an arcade. You don't have to have any strategy, you just need to be quick with your SM-2 firing buttons and mouse."
2,Harpoonage Review,"Well to be Frank, if your looking for a True full scale modern naval simulation dont stare to hard at Janes Fleet Command. At first Glance the harpoons flying off destroyers in a climatic scene looks very similar to CNN without a doubt. Shortly after playing i relized it was seemed to be more of an acion game than that of a simulation. As many others have said you are thrown into the battles which takes alot of planning and strategy away. Were is naval Combat without the strategy? The graphics are beautiful as a harpoon fan i always wondered what it would look like to watch my cruiser fire 8 harpoons in rapid sucession. Well now ive seen it. Great graphics, no strategy really the strategy is kinda forced on ya its either this way or take a few hits. Data is ok but nothing compared to the ship databases in harpoon of 10 years ago. No weapons changes? comon now that is just lazy programming there.Well if harpoon of tens years ago meet the graphics of Fleet command i am sold"
2,Good games but no instruction booklets,The games are good but there is no instruction booklets for two the games. I have tried to contact the manufacture 5 times and they will not even return my calls or e-mails. I would think twice before buying from them again.
5,Performs as advertised,Packed well easy to install heats up fast using it on a small shop sink that only had cold water
1,Bosch Ariston 4 Gal Mini Tank is Terrible!,I purchased this unit because of good experiences with Bosch products. This one is an exception. It is used to keep a hot water recirculation loop warm. A large Bosch instant gas hot water heater is the primary heating source. The Ariston unit has been installed per a layout in the Bosch instant unit manual. Everything was fine for about a year. Then the Arriston unit began to stop functioning. Finally found a tiny reset button under the front cover (which is anything but easy to access). Had to constantly reset the unit to keep it going. Called tech support with Bosch. They said that I had the temp too hot on the Arriston. Tried to lower the heating set point. This is not labeled. It helped for a short time and then the trips began again. Am going to throw this piece of junk in the garbage and buy a different brand.
4,Art Studio,A great little hot water heater that fits under my pedestal sink and looks clean and neat in my art studio. Only require hot water for cleaning out paint brushes and washing hands so it provides enough hot water on demand to meet my needs. Thinking of adding another at the end of the line in my home since one bath is a considerable distance from the current hot water source? An easy install too.
1,a good water saver,My well produces 6 GPM. I have a tankless water heater and I waste water until the hot water arrives. I put the 4 gal. ariston in series with the water heater for the downstairs shower-it works great- instant hot water. I also put a 2 gal. ariston under the kitchen sink. They both save us water. The tankless water heater heats on demand so every time you turn the valve you fire up the water heater. In the kitchen I hooked the ariston to the cold water (it takes too long for hot water) Works fine for me since I do most of the dishes by hand. The fridge has cold water for drinking. These heaters are easy to install so it can be changed in about 5 min. Bill CA.
1,Not what I expected,"Purchaced this product for a small bathroom with one shower. It heats hot enough, but will not provide anymore than 4 gallons of hot water. When it runs out, it dosen't even come out warm. A 6+ gallon unit might allow a decent shower. I believed the unit would provide unlimited hot water for showering. As it is now, I have to run on half flow and shut off shower head intermittently to allow a decent shower. I am still in search of a point of use heater for my shower. They aparently don't sell those here in the States. I remember seeing a waterproof unit that attaches just before the shower head, with a thermostat, that allows for constant hot water.Mike B"
1,useless product,"installed this heater, after letting it run for 30 minutes I only got slightly warm water. Verified the input voltage and the wattage used. Waste of money"
4,Like this little heater,This water heater was just what we needed. The only issue was the temp had to be turned up which required opening up the front panel. It was an easy process though. I would recommend this heater. It was about $50 less than homedepot and free shipping.
4,So far so good.,I installed this in the basement about 18 feet under a second floor bathroom where hot water previously had to travel 60 feet. I rigged it so the old hot water line goes into the Ariston. My wife is now happy. She gets hot water in a minute instead of five. Installation was not bad if you have some plumbing skills. I got this model because of the 120v plug in. I do a lot of DIY but I'm not into running 220 lines. Hope I get many many years out of this.
2,Short life,I purchased one of these units about 3 years ago for my kitchen sink. It was wonderful. However just under 3 years it started leaking. Then the entire unit went out. A lot of money for such a short life. I would not purchase another one of these. Just too much money for such a short time.
5,Very Hot,"Heater arrived in great shape. I installed it under the sink in our pool house. It took about an hour to plumb the tank and install a recp. I wound up setting the thermostat just a tad past ""Ideal"". After that, the water temp was just about right to suit me. Works great for cleaning up bbq utensils, plates, etc. I definitely recommend."
4,High value for price,"We purchased this in order to supply hot water at kitchen sink that is a long run from main water heater. It works as intended, with immediate hot water, at a user-adjustable heat level, and keeps up with most kitchen needs in a month of use. And when the distant main hot water heater finally gets hot water to the kitchen (after a couple of minutes), this point-of-use water heater does not have to add as much heat rise from that time on. The user-adjustable temperature setting requires some effort to change, but it can be done.Because I am not skilled at plumbing installations, we had this installed by a professional plumber. This turned out to be a good idea because it seemed more involved than a typical amateur plumbing project. We are very satisfied with the end results."
1,Tank failed in under two years,I bought this on sale to supply a kitchen sink and the tank failed in under two years. Replaced with a Reliance 6 gallon. We'll see..............
3,"Good, but one flaw","I have two of these, both 4 gallon. Problem is with the thermostat. The first one had a temprange of 110 to 170!! Dangerously hot at the high end. It was inconsistent. When it got too hot, the reset switch would trip, requiring me to remove front panels to find teensy reset button, only accessible with tiny tool. It was doable. I complained, company sent me replacement, which seems to have range of 110-130, much safer. Ok, but most hot water heaters (standard 40-gallon) have temp ranges much narrower, also easier to adjust.Bosch bought out these people, I forget first company.The second one is at my summer cabin, but has performed better.Wuld I buy this again? Yes, but only because so few choices out there.Also - small issue - summer cabin has to be drained for winter and these heaters have no drain outlet - you must deal with lifting it and turning it upside down."
2,Company is terrible to deal with,"This unit suited my needs fine until it failed (two times). The first unit lasted less than two years, the second almost three. I purchased the unit from Home Depot and they replaced the first heater but directed me to the manufacture for the second one. After about twenty minutes on hold, I was connected with a technician. The man shot a multitude of questions at me in a very rude manner.Bottom line is that they don't honor the six year warranty if you do not replace the ""anode rod"" once a year.I will never purchase anything made by this company again.Bosch GL4 Ariston 4-Gallon Point-of-Use Indoor Electric Mini-Tank Water Heater"
3,Ariston 4 water heater,"The kitchen sink was a long way from the main water heater and it took a long time for heated water to reach it. I bought the 4 gallon heater and it had a bad thread on one of the fittings. Other than that, it appeared to be well constucted. I contacted Amazon and they apaid for return shipping. I reordered the 2.5 gal unit and it way just fine. I was pleased that there was no hassle with the return process."
4,I love it,"When our hot water heater went out I began gathering information on water heaters. Because I am on a well and live in a draught stricken area watching 4 gal. of water go down the kitchen drain every time I needed hot water was nerve racking. I was considering putting the new water heater on the back porch closer to the kitchen and redoing the plumbing. Then I saw this little gem. It is the only one I saw that you could install in line with your house hot water. My daughter had the same problem so I bought 2. It wash't bad to hook up. Our biggest problem was pulling out our dishwasher so my husband could change something and give me a plug in for it. We both love them. Turn the knob, hot water. The fact that it is in line with my big water heater I thought was a real plus and no one had to change around any plumbing or look at a water heater on the back porch."
5,Works perfectly,"I purchased this water heater for a temporary living situation where only 110v power is available. I have it hooked up to my shower and my sink. The water heats up quickly - I plug it in 15-30 min before a shower, and again around dinner time so I can wash dishes. 4 gallons is barely enough for a shower, but I can manage, and the result is far superior to a cold shower. I knew when I bought this product that it was only 4 gallons, so I did not expect long hot showers. It works perfectly as a small hot water heater when only 110v is available."
4,installs easy & fast,"Old titan water heater gave out,ariston arrived quickly and installed quickly, 1 hourwe are planning on installing more of them in another house that has 4 bathrooms and two kitchens. It is not mfg. in Italy as the label states mfg. in china."
1,"Neat design too bad it doesnt work, and bosch wont help you","So i ordered this online, went to homedepot and got the water hook ups. It wont power on, the book gives you some troubleshooting tips then says to call bosch if you need help. I called they said that i have to have a electrician or plumber there for trouble shooting, well if i am going to get one here why would i call them? So the point is if it works thats great, on the down side if it doesnt they arent going to help you or rather your going to need to pay for it. i would go with a different brand if i were y'all."
1,think again before buying this heater,"I installed this mini-tank water heater three weeks ago to provide hot water for my washer machine. It worked just for two weeks. Now the heating light remains off and no hot water at all no matter how I adjusted the temperature knob. I called Bosch customer center and I was shocked to learn that the manufacturer warranty on this unit only covers the parts, not the labor. I have never heard about something like that in terms of warranty! My advice is don't buy it."
2,2 stars,"Most of these stories appeared in the ""New Yorker."" The ""New Yorker"" gets up to 15,000 unsolicited fiction manuscripts a year. When I read stories as mediocre as these, I think, ""There has to be better stories among the 15,000 sent to the ""New Yorker."" I like a lot about the student-at-the-professor's-house story (I forget its title). Humor comes forth. But the others have that incestuous MFA-writer's-program-graduate feel to them. They are precious, politically correct, and rather dull. And they hardly ever have endings. They just kind of peter out. Perhaps that's being ""literary"" by not using ""standard"" endings. But stories that look like a last page is missing, are not to be recommended, and I don't recommend this tome."
4,"ExcelleAn Excellent book, Intriguing!","The story of an English Butler Working for an american aristocrat. We get an inside look into the mind, and lifestyle of our character as he begins his journey through the unheard of Time off, An Incredible work as a man struggles to full-fill his fathers ideology, and his own dreams. Really an Excellent Work."
5,Great product!,"I've tried many probiotics and this is the most effective product. I usually take four with each meal, which helps greatly with my health condition."
3,"Old-time folksy sound, with a bit of English folksongs","A fan of English/Irish/Scottish music, I was a bit disappointed in Trapazoid's album, Long Time Down This Road. True, one of it's songs, 'The blacksmith', is performed in the traditional celtic style, but most are not. Trapazoid's style has a rustic applachian sound, mixed with a bit of early 70's twang. Two original songs, 'War of the Flea', and the requirem for the lost percussionist, are breathtaking and worth listening to. But these three tracks are the only good ones on the album."
3,Good cleanser...,"This is a good cleanser for normal/oily skin that doesnt need any extra help. I have problematic skin (acne marks/rosacea) and it didnt aggravate my skin, but it didnt help anything either."
1,Horrible!,BURNED HORRIBLY! Left my skin feeling dry and chapped. Used it only at night and the effects did not go away for days after use.
5,love it!,I absolutely love this product. It foams up so nice with just a small amount. My face always feels very clean following use. It does not irritate my sensitive skin and I've been using it for years. I'm hooked for sure.
4,Glad I Tried It!!,"I have had mild acne for quite some time and I have VERY oily skin. I have used EVERY acne product out there, including the expensive ones. I never really thought to try this before but I heard it was good for oily skin. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I'm pretty pleased with it. It lathers well and rinses off clean. The smell is a little different but once you wash it off, the smell is gone. My face feels really clean after washing. Slowly, I see an improvement in my complexion. Typically it takes 4-12 weeks to see true results when you start using a product. Hopefully it will continue to get better. So far I am happy with it and will stick with it. I recemmend this to anyone who has oily skin."
5,The bomb!,Wonderful item! My skin feels great after each wash! I have no need for any other cleansing solution; this is one stop shopping!
4,"Good product, cleans well",Doesn't leave skin dry or overly oil. They fixed the issue will the product will discolor due to some reaction with the dispenser.
5,Absolute best,"I have been using this cleanser for years now. I use it all year round without scrubs or any additional cleansers. On its own, I feel it does a great job of cleansing. Although it may not remove all the oil and grime, it does cleanse well compared to other deep clean cleansers."
1,Dries and Burns - not for sensative skin,"I used this product for a week, my skin ended up extremely dry and burning. It took a good week for my skin to return to normal. I would not recommend this to people that have sensative skin"
4,Leaves your face feeling clean.,Rinses off completely so makes your face feel really clean. Doesn't dry out your skin. Great product.pat@WeSnoreNoMore.com
3,good product... not very good smell...,"I am not sure it has deep-clean feature, but it seems to work to clean normally, I just don;t like the smell..."
2,I frequently use Neutrogena products but this was ...,"I frequently use Neutrogena products but this was my first time using the deep cleansing wash. I was very disappointed with this product. When applied to my face, it took much rubbing and applying more and more soap from the pump to make a sufficient lather. When thoroughly rinsed, it felt like there was a still layer of film on my face. Therefore, it didn't feel clean enough. The pump was very convenient though, less mess. If you like Neutrogena products, I would stay away from this one. Their bars of soap are much better."
2,Is this product legit?,"I order 4 of this and they come in plastic bag, which is needless to say some of them is leaking. I would have think they would come in a box instead of plastic bag, which look like they were package manually and individual."
1,made problems worse,"I bought this to clear up some clogged pores on my forehead. I used it every day for 2 months and the problem only seemed to get worse. Once I stopped using this my forehead was cleared up within a week, not sure what would have happened if I never used this at all but if it only works when u stop using it then it is a bad product... lol"
1,"It's not that I didn't like this product, ...","It's not that I didn't like this product, but I had a pretty severe allergic reaction to it. I was very surprised since I have used Neutrogena products most of my adult life."
4,I had been using Herbal Essences Foaming Face ...,"I had been using Herbal Essences Foaming Face Wash before trying Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser. The smell of the Herbal Essences cleaner is slightly more pleasant than the smell of the Neutrogena. I liked the fact that the Neutrogena seemed thicker than the Herbal Essences. Both products seem to do a good job of cleaning. I liked the pump bottle that came with the Neutrogena. The Herbal Essences had a squeeze bottle. The pump is more convenient. I would recommend this product to friends and family, but whether I would choose this product over Herbal Essences would depend upon the price. Given a similar price, I would choose the Neutrogena."
4,I have tried many different facial cleansers and ...,"I have tried many different facial cleansers and this was far better than most and at a great price! I have """"combination skin"""" and this product made my face softer and less flaky and my pores noticeably smaller. I loved that it came in a pump, rather than in a bar, and that therefore, there was less mess and waste. I would recommend this product to family and friends, especially during the winter months when problem skin is aggravated by lack of humidity and harsh weather conditions."
4,High Quality Pointe Shoe without High Price,My daughter was fitted for her first pointe shoe in August 2012. This is the exact shoe that a professional selected for her. The box broke down & her foot had grown a bit. I ordered from this vendor and quickly received the shoe. It did not fit & I was shipped a replacement shoe while returning the shoes I ordered. NOTE: Must order matching Capezio Ribbon & Elastic from separate vendor!! Is not included with Shoes!Pro: Exact shoe at much lower price than from professional.Con: Professional included Ribbon & Elastic. Shoe does not come with matching Capezio Ribbon & Elastic. Ordered from another vendor. Total Price still less than from professional.
3,"Good, but could be much better","The writing in Calliope's Mousepad is very good; the collection of short stories and essays is filled with talent and stories that could be entertaining. However, only one story in the entire book felt finished to me. As I reached the end of every other one in the book I kept thinking ""that's it?"" It appeared as if the writers had a word limit and just stopped when they hit that point. As a result, I was disappointed with the content. The writing itself is very good, but the content is incomplete."
4,Classic Survival Story,"This is a very good book about surviving as a POW in Vietnam. Itdoes get a bit lengthy at time when he is discussing the attemptsto ""correct"" his attitude and he describes the same philosophya few times too many but it is an extremely in depth look atthe philosophical and mental problems faced by a POW in Vietnam."
2,Five Years to Freedom,"Interesting but written more as a novel and not as an actual recount of his 5 year imprisonment in the hands of the North Vietnamese. The minute detail of his every recollection during his 5 years of captivity makes it difficult to believe that he himself wrote his memoirs. Nevertheless I salute him for his bravery, his will to survive and service to his country."
5,A must read,"This book should be on everyone's ""must read"" list. It should also be on the must read list for evey high school student. This book is very well written and easy to follow. It is also very hard to put down once you start reading it. Being a Vietnam War Veteran myself, I would highly recomend this book to anyone."
2,Fast service - product smells of mildew/mold.,Nick Rowe was a great man his death was tragic. There's a lot to learn from. He didn't spend 5 wasted years as a POW - he spent 5 years planning for freedom. I really wanted a good full size of version of this book. I would understand if the book was used or had wear. What I am angry about is that the book smells of mildew/mold. I have been trying to figure out how to remove the odor and have isolated it so it won't smell up my other books. I don't have time to jeopardize my job and take off time from work and I am not waiting in line at the post office forever. You get a bad book for mailing me a book that smells very bad - as if you didn't know it smelled?
5,Salute to a true American hero,"I read this book in 1973 as a private in the US Army. Through my years as an officer in the military, Nick Rowe was and always will be a legend. Read about his five years of extreme tribulations and trials. Few have the iron will, determination and humanitarianism Nick had- his impact through this book and his deeds are beyond words. This is a great book which is a profound record of a great warrior, a great American and a quiet professional dedicated to the highest principles and mission - that is, to provide freedom for those who love peace."
4,Harrowing tale,James Rowe's story is one that makes you appreciate how good we have things in our day to day lives. I love POW tales because I am always hoping the person(s) can find a way to escape to freedom. This story was fine but I would say a little darker & more depressing than most POW tales I have read.
4,A tough book to read.,"It's hard to imagine a person going through what COL Rowe went through and surviving, let alone maintaining the patriotism and will to live that he did. Some parts of this book will be lost on readers who've never served in the military. The story moves slowly at times, but by the time it's complete, the pace serves to give the reader some idea of Rowe's perception of the passage of time in his five years of captivity. It's too bad the US Army can't make this book required reading, since it can't send everyone to SERE School. It would give those serving a whole new perspective on being captured, living in captivity, being indoctrinated and exploited, and having to live in primitive condtions. Personally, after reading this book, I'll have a hard time complaining about military living conditions during training and deployments."
5,The most gripping story I've ever read.,"Mr Rowe suffered five years of unimaginable horror for values he believed in. The strength of his character is incredible. While telling his story, he also tells us what a true hero is like. It's not Rambo or Chuck Norris single-handedly blowing their way out of a POW camp. Rather, it is one mans daily struggle for physical, mental and spiritual survival. God bless him."
5,Great book!,"If you have interest in the Viet Nam War, from any angle, read this book. Major Rowe represents American troops at their very finest. A must read for anyone who wants to know the true face of Indochinese communism."
5,Five Years To Freedom,I read this book every few years. It is that good. The book is an inspiration. You understand what man is capable of and understand how trivial everyday challenges are. I had the opportunity to work with one of the men in the story. This book is 100% true and accurate.
3,Not Bad...but also not Great!!,"I didn't not like this book, but I also didn't like it very much either. The characters were all confusing and Heathcliff was the worst one of all!! Catherine the daughter was a confused character, sometimes I think along with other readers......that Emily wrote this to compete with her sisterm b/c she didn't feel loved enough and had probelms of her own that she could onlt deal with by writing a book that basically describes her life and what happened in her life from Childhood to her adulthood. Emily Bronte is a great writer but this was not one of her great books. I would not recomend this book to those who do not like to read too much. If you like to read then you will like this book!!"
4,A beautifully written novel of love and tragedy,"I loved this book.. It's beautifully written and well composed. A novel of passion, deceit, and forgiveness.. An undying love that affected many in the book. A wonderful novel that I recommend all to read.. Katharine 14"
3,Wuthering Heights,"This is one of the first novels I have read that came from the 1800's... It is truly a great novel... and I even liked the 1930's film... and even liked the song... funny!It's really a piece of art.. It kind of reminds me of a VC Andrews about rage & revenge.. Probably the ""Flowers In The Attic"" series... It's truly a great novel, and a heartbreaking one of that... and I had some problem understanding some of the words that I didn't understand... I had to look them up in a dictionary..."
2,Boring,"I read this book because my friend said it was good. I wish I'd never read it. I wanted an intelligent book that was interesting and I could enjoy. Wuthering Heights is, simply put, a bad book. Thank god for Isaac Asimov!"
2,YUCK!,"The most absurd story I have ever read. I found the characters unbelievable and their behaviour utterly inconsistent.However, let us give Bronte her due: the book is marvellously structured, with the story told by Nelly Dean contained in the story told by the narrator. Moreover, through the character of down-to-Earth, jolly Nelly Dean, Bronte makes plausible a story that would never be believed otherwise.It's a pity she had to waste her talent as a writer on a such a pointless story, centered on an incoherent, cruel, mean character like Heathcliff. Hopefully she was not pointing him out as the perfect lover!!!"
4,Satisfied,I enjoyed this classic. I didn't know the story prior to reading it and once I adjusted to the older style prose it was a pleasant read.
2,WH - not for today's reader,"I found Wuthering Heights very difficult to read for many reasons. First of all it was hard to keep up with because the author jumped around to many differnet characters. Secondly, the old English used was hard to understand and having to jump back and forth to the foot notes made you lose your train of thought. It also wasn't the type of story I though it would be. I had heard it was a love story between Heathcliff and Catherine but I didn't feel the love. If you like stories with old English then this is the book for you."
3,"Drawn OUT, but a classic",My daughter had to read this book for English @ school and she's 15 and said that it was long drawn out and boring because of the depth gone into to descibe everything....
1,Dogs Breakfast,"This book is an absolute mess. It's told in the first person by different narrators but as I was bored and so unfocused a lot of the time I was sometimes not sure who was narrating. Heathcliffe the 'hero' was annoying and in some ways pathetic and the heroine Cathy seemed like a spoiled brat. I didn't like the use of dialect either- It's a lot easier to read English as it should be written and imagine an accent to it rather than see these strange alien words in print. What an absolute mess of a book, I can't believe all the praise I see heaped on it."
2,excellent service and product,"I was very pleased with the book,""Wurthering Heights"" and the service in sending it to me. THank you."
3,Bronte sisters,"The Bronte sisters have always seemed to come up as respectable classical female writers and as story telling goes, I will agree that they can tell a story. I have notice though, that their stories have the common denominator of detailing the ugliest side of humanity. Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life. The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand. Eventually. Maybe.If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book. As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment. Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, etc."
4,A pleasant read,The story is known to a number of people but reading it over allows one to experience it from a different perspective as we grow.
2,Wuthering Heights,"I disliked this book enough that I waded through half of it, and then just stopped. It is well-written, but so dark and foreboding that I simply did not enjoy reading it. I gave it a good try but decided to go for books I actually enjoyed."
2,Free SF Reader,"Set on the moors, it is a pity that the Hound of the Baskervilles didn't get 'em. This would have saved a lot of characters a lot of grief.An orphan is taken in, and the problems start there as he grows up, has his own problems and inflicts them on others.The great detective has something to say about such places :""But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filledfor the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think ofthe deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in,year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to usfor help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her. Itis the five miles of country which makes the danger."""
1,Wuthering Heights,"Wuthering Heights great example of mid-18th century literature but lacks the hook needed to engage the reader. The overly dramatic love scenes and long drawn out sections provide the periods of ennui. The characters are poorly developed, and the lack of minor characters leaves the reader wandering. The novel seems to start off sluggishly, and then it picks up, only to be followed by the slowness again. If anything, Wuthering Heights shows the destructiveness of love and revenge through the character Heathcliff. The novel seemed to be one long drawn out soap opera, where the characters rarely changed and new characters were rarely added. Overall, this novel does not meet the adoration that it is constantly given."
1,It Out Herods Herod!,"And just why would Ms. Bronte write a book with not a single likeable character? In fact, everyone in the novel would be rejected by Jerry Springer as being too degenerate for his show. No doubt the writing is facile enough, but by page 5, the story itself descends into what has to be the most turgid potboiler imagineable. It's all there: lynching a litter of puppies,hanging a springer spaniel,unceasing child abuse, the brutalization of women, and pretty descriptions of the seasons. Highly recommended for the budding mass murderer."
1,Glad Bronte died before she could write any more trash!,"What a waste of time, precious time in my life that I will never be able to get back. The only good part was the end when I tossed the book into the fireplace and watched it burn."
4,Passionate and Bizarre,"I read this book mainly because it was talked about a lot in Eclipse. I was shocked by how dark and Gothic it was. I can't imagine what people must have thought when it was published. If I could pick two words to describe Wuthering Heights it would be ""passionate"" and ""bizarre."" I've never read anything like it. I knew as I was reading it that I wasn't supposed to like Cathy. She has a passionate temper that was very unlikeable and yet I couldn't hate her. In fact, I related to her in a lot of strange ways. I kind of agree with Edward Cullen's assessment of the book that it's not a love story but a hate story. The ending was what made me like this book. A lot of the characters are run madly by their passions and I thought for sure the ending would be nothing but a disaster. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. If Eclipse has made you curious as to what happens in this book, give it a try. You might actually like it."
4,A complex but intriguing book,"Among the propertied classes of Georgian England, life was never simple. This is the tale of Earnshaw family, and those they touched. It's a tale of love and tenderness, and also a tale of greed and cruelty. It's a story as complex as the times it explores and the people who inhabited it.This is an excellent book. Correct, if you want an up-beat book of happily-ever-after, then you will be disappointed. But, if you want a complex book of human lives and loves and passions of all sorts, then this is a book you should read.(Review of Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte)"
2,Boring and confusing,"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" or ""Frankenstein"". Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."
2,Too Heavy,"I know this is a classic loved by many. I, however, did not enjoy reading it. I read it through to the end, but it was tough. I did not like any of the characters except for Nelly, & Cathy (the daughter). When the dialogue was of Joseph, it was extremely difficult to read. I had to force myself to read it aloud just to figure out what he was saying. I don't like to work that hard when reading a book. For its time, I know it was a grand book. The writing was fine, but it was depressing and almost all the characters too flawed for my taste."
2,Good story but hard to get into.,"It was very hard for me to get into this story. The words were very old-fashioned, and some scenes seemed to go on for a long time. I thought it had a good plot, but I really only liked the first half. It took me a long time to finish this, and when I finally did, I felt that it ended abruptly."
2,I always thought this was overrated.....,"I can appreciete the unique style of Bronte's prose and the fact that this book has relevant themes that may strike a chord with today''s readers. But I remember being let down by this book and the finishing with a sense of apathy towards the characters. Many people relate the theme and character interaciton in this book to the modern day soap opera, daytime talkshows or MTV reality shows and thus deaming the book to have some sort of everlasting social message. The problem is that for the most part all those things stink and always have so what are these comparisons saying about this book. Maybe there is a reason why everyone read's this in high school....becuase it is the only age that can appreciate it.Clearly Im not in the norm as most people disagree with me but if you are looking to get into a ""classic"" there are much better books you can turn to."
3,Had to Read For School,"Wow! my opinion really changed from the beginning of the book to the end. In all honesty, at first, it was boring, then it got better, and at the end I was a little confused. I had to read it for school but I liked this one the best out of all the books I had to read for school this year. Try it out, you just might like it!"
3,Ahead of its time,"Powerful tale, not perfect but well ahead of its time. Two of literature's great characters in Heathcliff and Catherine Linton, an unusually well-developed supporting cast, and innovative narrative control that utilizes two classic ""unreliable narrators."" An accessible, gripping interrogation of nature versus nurture. A landmark, and the bar against which other works of this time should be gauged. 3 1/2 stars out of 5."
4,It's a classic for a reason,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. While it's a beautiful book, and I will probably read it again, I could not stand the story! All of the characters are horrible people, in my opinion, and the only thing that kept me from throwing the book across the room was the last two chapters. If I had not had to read this for class, I would not have finished it at all - though I am certainly glad I did finish it.If you're looking to read the Classics, definitely do read this. Same goes for if you're looking to read a classic romance, or one of the Gothic classics. However, if you're looking for a ""good"" book, one that will leave you happy or going ""aww,"" you're at the wrong book."
5,Amazing,"I just finished reading Wuthering Heights and, though I never really had much of an interest in romances, this book changed my perspective. The characters are interesting if not likeable, and it would be impossible to guess where the plot would turn next, it being controlled by a fabulous imagination. The book is wonderful, I got to a certain point- a point early on, too- and I could not stop reading."
3,Not exactly what I had in mind,"When first started reading this I expected it to be about two lovers who were somehow being driven apart. And although that proves to be true, it's far more complicated than that. Filled with hate, revenge, and anger, you can expect to find very little happiness in this book. As for the characters, I found it impossible to like any of them except for Hareton. You have characters who are so self centered and filled with rage, that in their time of weakness you can't even pity them for they're that despicable. But don't get me wrong, each character has their moments that make you want to forget all their flaws, but those moments are limited.Emily Bronte created a book about love and hate, and what they can do to people. Driven with love and hate, people do crazy things and this books goes to show you that. And although this book had it's slow parts, I still found it to possess a well thought out story. And as for the ending..well that part I enjoyed."
4,Couldn't walk away,"A good read! I have a lot of people who want to borrow it, and would if it wasn't on my KINDLE."
3,Wurthiering Heights,"I know this is a classic, and I understand the value of a female writer at the time, but I found it, at times, hard to follow the characters."
2,I didn't care for this book,"I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring, although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book."
3,great narration and character development book,"i had heard mixed things about Wuthering Heights, but decided to give it a try on daily lit to see if it could hold my attention. since i've been busy with school i haven't had the chance to read any other way, so it's been a good way to at least feel like i'm reading something.anyhow, the first half or so was rather boring for me, with lots of background and overly descriptive passages. i was definitely glad to be reading it in the daily lit format. i don't think i would have stuck with it otherwise. but, after that, it really picked up, and i found myself clicking for the next installment often.in the end, i can definitely say i enjoyed it, but the dull beginning lent the lower rating. it was quirky and fun and the character development was wonderful. i particularly enjoyed the style of narration and will be much less leary of picking up another bronte book in the future."
4,Dark Romantic Book,"I had already known that 'Wuthering Heights' was going to be a dark love story. Therefore, I was unsurprised when I read it and discovered that it was THAT twisted. However, it was also gripping and very interesting. You do not expect a woman in the 1800s to write a book with such romantic passion - because that is where the darkness comes from, the passion that two of the characters have for each other.I really enjoyed this book, though I must admit I was feeling a bit down after I read it. This book will definitely have you re-think Romance. Do you really want that all-consuming love? A love that causes anger, hatred, even death?If you are a fun of romance and old-century books, do not hesitate to pick this book up. If you like gloomy moors, and tales of strife, you shall like this book, too. This is a perfect combination of the two genres.Good reading!"
5,"A true classic, though a bit slow at times","In such situations, it is customary to start out with a ""good and the bad"" scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England. Heathcliff is a maniac with a likeable streak (mostly it's just sympathy). Catherine is unbridled, wild and cruel. But it seems the narrator (Nelly) is a bit too perfect.The bad: The plot can be a little too complex at times, and it's hard to follow. And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read."
5,No Words describe it...,"I read this book when i was sick and asked my father to bring me one of his books. He brought me this one, and I could not put it down. I cried and wondered and thought about everything in it for days afterward. I still think about it. It was a whole experience, the reading of it, and taking it all in. i can understand why some high school people wouldn't just love it, but i think that has something to do with being ""made"" to read it. I read it before anyone made me, so reading it again was easier. I seriously think that it is one of the best books ever written..."
4,I Will Change my Life,I still see those three grave stones in my mind. Two covered with grass -- one newly turned. I must change my life.
3,A Worthwhile Study.,"Actually I was not assigned to read this book. But I felt that if I was going to be an English Major I should have some knowledge of this book. This is not the drum I march to. Also, this book does not really match ""Jane Eyre."" Nevertheless, it is still an important piece of literature. Emily Bronte presents us with very beautiful images. She also offers us deep psychological insights into human nature. She also makes the characters fairly convincing. Emily Bronte also does a pretty good job in helping us to see why the characters act the way they do, and she does keep us in suspense. I can not say I cherish this book, but what I can say is that I am glad I took the time to read it even though it was not assigned."
3,This is OK,I didn't like how the author writes. Otherwise I wanted to read this book for a challenge. I am going to keep reading this a little at a time for a challenge.
4,Wuthering Heights,"Wuthering Heights - is one of the excellent classic novels that should be read by everyone, that likes Emily Bronte novels."
1,A Most Unpleasant Read,"I gave this one star, not because you can go no lower, but because it is well-written and has a coherent story line. Aside from that, however, I found it quite lacking. I personally found the story to be dreadful and unpleasant. I generally have no issue with unpleasant characters or unhappy endings, but aside from the writing style and Bronte's ability to hold the story together in a clear manner I found nothing enjoyable about it, and pleasant or not books are meant to be enjoyed, elsewise you're wasting your time."
3,Wuthering Heights,"I realize this is a classic. I just didn't enjoy reading it. The basic story was good, the characters complex but most were not likeable. The moors where it took place were so isolated, there wasn't much interaction with any others except at W. H. and at the Grange. I felt everyone was mentally afflicted in one way or another. The ending was suppose to be a happy marriage but it didn't seem joyful, just thank goodness the story ended. This was over many years proclaimed as the greatest romantic novel, the love was too painful for me to be appreciated."
4,Cry in happiness and sorrow,By sense we all share that of hurt feelings from friends but from those we consider family cut the deepest and sometimes can not be forgotten even though forgiven. We should all learn a thing or two from the characters in this book. A wonderful read and a lesson for all.
3,Classic,The book took me forever to read it seems. I usually can read a short story like this in a day or two but it took me nearly two weeks to finish this one. I did enjoy the story and I will definitely recommend to other readers. Everyone should have the pleasure of reading Wuthering Heights.
4,Available free on Librivox.org,"This was recorded by Ruth Golding for librivox.org and is available free, gratis and for nothing at that site - as 80,000 people have already discovered."
1,Depressing Book,"I disliked this book thoroughly--it was completely different from what I thought it would be. I couldn't even find a character that LIVED that I liked and was rooting for. By the end, I really disliked them all. If you are looking for a nice romantic read like Jane Eyre or Emma or Persuasion then DON'T read this book. I am sure it is classical literature and makes a nice commentary on society, but as I was not reading this for an English class, I wouldn't know about any of that. I was not analyzing it, I wanted to read it for fun but didn't enjoy it at all."
4,Sucker for the Classics,"I've always been a sucker for reading the classics and finally got a chance to read this one. The language takes time to get used to if you haven't read any old literature in a while, but just like most classics - definitely worth the read! And, how can you beat free?!"
4,Wuthering Heights Review,"After the first two chapters, the book takes off. You are thrown into the hectic lives of the inhabitants of the Grange and Wuthering Heights. The language is beautiful, and the plot takes you on many twists and turns."
2,I did not enjoy this book,"I know it's a classic, and I appreciate that it's well written; however, the characters are just not awful, especially the protagonist."
3,A strange love story,"Wuthering Heights is the name of the house where the love story between Heathcliff and Catherine takes place. Romance, insanity and hatred are blended in this relationship that goes beyond generations. Both main characters are not the typical heroes of this kind of novels, and that makes it more interesting."
4,Great condition,I ordered several of these books as Xmas gifts for coworkers. The books arrived shrink wrapped together in very good condition!
3,don't believe all the hype!,"don't believe all the hype, this is not a love story this is a hate story. Don't get me wrong it's a great book, well writen but I don't understand where the 'great love story' was suppose to start."
2,My Review,"I have to say it: I did not like the book. I willingly admit that Emily Bronte had heaps of talent and writes beautifully, but I couldn't bring myself to like any character in the book. They all seemed, rude, selfish, and insane to me, and there were very few or no aspects in which I could relate to or sympathize with them. In short, I have nothing against the writer, and her style, but the plot and characters in this story, are in my opinion, overdone and stretched beyond believability."
1,Tedious and unengaging,"I don't know what people see in this book. I found it irritating from the start -- all the characters are thoroughly unlikeable. After slogging my way through a quarter of the book, I found I still couldn't care less what happened to these people.The writing is also painfully verbose and florid. For a better story, I would have been willing to cope with it, but here it was just another reason to put the book down and never pick it up again."
5,Classic read!,"This book was better than I remember! A must read for those that like controversy, drama, twists and turns! Emily Bronte never lets the reader down!"
3,Wuthering heights,I thought it was good. I really enjoyed reading this book for my college English class. Over all I give it 3 stars
5,"Well,you ARE immature......","My interest in Wuthering Heights was spurned when I learned that the authoress was the sister of Charlotte Bronte,one of my favourite authoress of all times.And I am definitely pleased to learn that Emily Bronte parallels her sister in depicting love,passion and vengeance.The revenge that Heathcliff exacts on the Earnshaws and the Lintons were slow and tortuous,but one may have to reconsider his wretched childhood ,full of humiliation and degradation.There is also an element of mystery present:did the tenant really see Catherein's ghost?And did Heathcliff murder Hindley?(The details of his death seemed somewhat ambiguous)Overall,I'll say that anyone with an appreciation for good literature will thoroughly enjoy this book."
5,Wuthering heights,Best book ever. Even better the second time around. It is a dark and haunting love story that will capture readers for the rest of time
3,A Moving Story of Hate and Love,"As I read the book ""Wuthering Heights"" it was easy for me to see why it was named a classic. It is very well written, the plot is interesting and all it wants is a story book ending. Throughout the book the reader finds that the misery of the characters is because of the selfishness and hatred that some of the characters have for one another. One sees that the hatred of one man for a small orphan child carries into the second and third generation of his children and grandchildren. Although Emily Bronte masterpiece can never top her sisters book,""Jane Eyre"", it is worth reading, and contamplating its message."
3,Stop Whining!,"Just when the book starts getting interesting, someone starts whining and complaining about their illnesses! I was very annoyed in those parts. It took me a painstaking 3 months to finish the book. Although after I finished it, I still thought about the story's point. The underlying theme to the story is powerful and that makes the book good. Yet, the road is very slow and sometimes difficult. Some of the characters are very annoying!"
2,I Hated Everyone,"All I could think about when reading this novel is what character am I supposed to be interested in. My answer was none of them. I could not stand anyone of the main characters, and began to rejoice in anything negative that happened to them. Maybe I was supposed to feel that way. In any circumstance I would not say it was an enjoyable read."
2,Speed Reading Ruins Classic,"The story is the same and just as wonderful as it has always been. I bought the CD version for a car trip, and was extremely disappointed in the narration. It was read rapidly, and without pause. I found that, even though I know the story well, I could hardly keep up! I have several other books on CD, and have not had this problem. Too bad... it was a waste of money, and a long boring car trip!"
3,Didn't care for it,"There's no redeemable quality in either Heathcliff or Catherine. The more I read the more I despised them, the more I didn't really care what kind of havoc they wrecked on each other or their relationship. Their relationship is the epitome of codependency and somehow this is supposed to be regarded as one of the great love stories of our time. How masochistic are we?"
3,Darkest Kind Of Love,"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a tragic love story that has bitter and vengeful aspects to it. I dislike this novel because of the characters Catherine for her ""I'm beautiful everyone must love me"" attitude and Heathcliff for his ""Catherine doesn't love me so I must become bitter and ruin everyone else lives."" But this story has its good parts it shows raw and everlasting love. Even though the years have passed Heathcliff's and Catherine's love will last forever. This novel shows the darker side of love. It shows how love can put together or destroy people. Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest gothic novels like To Kill A Mockingbird."
1,"Classic read, really???","So I know that this is considered a classic book, I just assumed that meant it was supposed to be a good read. I cannot tell you how many times I just wanted to kill the main characters and be done with it. I only finished reading the book just to see if it EVER got any better. Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying. All I can say is Catherine needs to grow up and Heathcliff needs to get a life. Classic, yeah right!"
2,Depressing,"One of my favorite teachers told me this was her favorite book. She must have gotten something different out of it. I mostly despised the main characters, especially Heathcliff. The best part of the book is the last 20 pages when the daughter finally finds happiness but the rest was almost unbearable."
2,A Disappointment,"It took me a long time to get around to reading Wuthering Heights, and I have to admit, it was a slog. It's not that I have anything against novels from that time period; I count Jane Eyre and the works of Jane Austen among my favorite books. But Wuthering Heights did not live up to its reputation. The characters were universally unlikeable and unsympathetic. The story was meandering and ultimately unfulfilling. And the ""love story"" - more of a story of unreasonable obsession - did not move me. So count me among the few who did not fall in love with this novel."
3,This book was interesting but a little on the confusing side,Well this book is was very interesting but everyone had the same name so that made it confusing. But once you figured out who was who it was a very good book and totaly worth reading.
4,A dark love story set in the eightenth century.,Wuthering heights is a book whitch everyone should read. it is a facinating love story between two wild individuals. It contains many twist and turns that you would never sucpect. This book pulled me in and made me felt that I was right there. It is not hard to see why this book is a classic.
1,Boring,"Maybe it's just me but this was SOOOOOOOOOO boring. I read the first 50 or so pages and had to put it down. Too many characters were introduced and the story was lost almost immediately. I know it's a classic and I know I'm supposed to revere the writers of old, but this was a waste of time. Nothing against Bronte, just not my cup of tea. Stephen King said if a writer does not hook you in the first twenty pages, move on! I did."
2,Depressing,"Sadly, I couldn't even finish it. It is well written and interesting but it is depressing in the extreme. I read about half and I had to stop reading it and start reading a more uplifting story.I was expecting something closer to her sister's Jane Eyre, oh how wrong I was."
2,Not the Best Choice...,"Wuthering Heights is supposed to be a story about forbidden love, right? Well, it is to a point... but mostly it is just depressing. They both die near the end and they never get married. She marries an entirely different man, and after she dies he basically goes crazy with sadness. This story is extremely confusing, as well as slightly boring at times. It is hard to understand because of the time frame it is supposed to be in.This book is probably not for young readers, because of the difficult vocabulary and small print. It was hard for me to understand, so i can imagine what it would be like for, say, a ten year old. I do not recommend this book to someone who has a short attention span, because it is hard to follow and hard to get into. If you, by chance, like older literature and are good at comprehending, go for it! But it is not the best choice for someone who is used to reading newer, easier reads. Wuthering Heights is defiantly not a thriller."
5,Book Review,"The savings were beaucoup! This was a required reading book for school. The price was great, the delivery was quick, and the book was in great condition! Thanks!"
2,Interesting but tedious.,"Heathcliff is a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man inside and out. His character makes this an interesting story. But, it was a little tedious to read.Margo, a former college professor, enlightened me with some thoughts on the book which I am quoting here. This is from her comment below dated 2/4/09. ""Younger readers are fans of the story because they see in it the tumultuous passions of lovers obstructed by ""outsiders."" I think they ""get it."" My college students love it because they are mesmerized by the slow, agonizing destruction of one of the lovers as he takes his vengeance."" Thank you Margo.Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. (I mention sexual content solely for the purpose of providing information. Some readers may want to know this when recommending to young adults.) Setting about 1775 to 1805 England. Published about 1847. Genre: Gothic Romance (romance about obsession)."
1,I'm Sorry,"I'm sorry but I just did not like this book. It feels sloppily written at times and sometimes I wonder if she wrote the book just to compete with her sister (hey you never know). The only thing that I can compliment this book on is it's character development, by the end of the book (if you can stand to read the whole thing) you feel like you know them personally."
2,Rating as Bed Book,"When I ordered this book, the ""Bed Book"" was not clarified very clearly or I missed the point of what the bed book meant. It is a difficult reading posture for me maybe for another, it will be five stars."
3,Just couldn't make myself like it -,"I love the classics as much as anyone but I really can't get into a novel that makes me hate the main characters. Catherine is a petulant, spoiled ***** and I never wanted to lay into anyone as bad as I did Heathcliff. He is a deranged psychopath, and there is nothing remotely 'romantic' about his character. I'm not sure why the novel caught on the way it did, it was 300 pages documenting spoiled, self absorbed people and their unrelenting quest to destory any trace of happiness around them. Not my idea of a good read, but it was worth it to get to the end just to see his ass DIE. Good riddance!"
1,Wuthering Heights,"I am reading Wuthering heights in preparation for and AP English course, and am finding it to be the most tedious book I have ever read. I used to think that Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea dragged, but i was sadly mistaken. This book is a drawn out and dreary affair. I have enjoyed ""classic"" literature in the past but this is unworthy of being dubbed ""classic"". I would never reccomend this book to another living person, but maybe I'm just and ""immature"" reader."
2,Boring and confusing,"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like ""Picture of Dorian Gray"". Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."
2,mixed,i dont know if i would love or hate this book because i couldnt read it because im not the best reader and have to sound things out sometimes and i couldnt understand half the words on the first page alone and so i had to keep looking in the dictionary half the time to under stand and so i gave up and deleted the book but other people tell me its a good book i just coldnt understand it i hope other people like it
5,Audio Book,I used express delivery and it left the warehouse the same day I ordered it and I received it promptly. Thank you for an exceptional sale. I will do this again.
3,Impressed in an unintended way,"The love story between Catherine and Heathcliff was largely unimpressive and exceedingly disappointing. I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence. Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Bront's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale. Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye. I think it's worth venturing a read, but I'd say not to get your hopes up on everything everyone sells Heathcliff to be."
1,Romance.... Yeah right,"I usually stay away from classics since most likely I won't like it at all, but since I like romance and heard that Wuthering Heights is a great classic story, I decided to give it try.I just don't see how can this be a great classic romance story. There was hardly any romance. The characters aren't likeable that I just wanted them to just die basically. The whole story was just so boring and had this dark depressing feeling to it, which basically is the main point of the story.This will be the first and last time that I will read Wuthering Heights. Good thing I downloaded the book for free and didn't spend a penny on it."
3,A classic classic,An interesting read. Love is a great and terrible killer in the end. And there are many lessons to be learned from the story.
5,Wuthering Heights,"Horribly sad tale of a strange and tragic tale of love. Had trouble understanding what Joseph was saying, very hard accent. Before reading I watched the PBS Masterpiece production and was able to visualize it all the more."
5,A wonderful must-read for fans of other Bronte & Austen work,"I recommend this wonderful book to almost everyone! I especially love reading novels that take place in the past yet can be related to now. One thing I do recommend - when you start reading this book, as you piece character personalities and profiles together - write them down! Make a family tree! That is the one confusing part of this book but by getting things down on paper you help yourself to enjoy the book more and not worry so much about who is who ;)"
2,Tedious,"While I know this is considered a great Classic Romance, I failed to see the romance or the greatness. I decided to read this because I had never done so. I regretted that decision within three chapters. I was determined to finish it to find the wonder of this work that I had heard so much about. I failed to find it in all of it's almost 400 pages. It was a tedious read and nowhere near the great romance I was led to believe. While the last few pages were a payoff, they were not worth the torture of the previous ones."
3,Not what I expected.,"Not what I was expecting. For some reason I thought Heathcliff was going to be a typical romantic construct who had some dramatic character arc. I'm a little misanthropist myself so you would think I would like this novel, relishing along with my kindred spirit, but I was never quite captivated."
2,Misunderstanding,"I was under the impression that I had ordered an actual book. I wrote the seller who provided a link for an e-copy of the book. I appreciated the offer but my daughter needed the actual book for English class in school. Be aware of what you are ordering - if you want the actual book, verify that is what you ordered."
5,Great classic story very well narrated,"After listening to this unabridged version of Wuthering Heights I am a great fan of Tantor Unabridged Classics. The narrator did an excellent job bringing the characters to life. This is a wonderful story though a bit depressing. Many classics from that time are written with a an overwrought, tradgic mood. If you can handle that, it is a good story of a dysfunctional family, revenge and love."
3,Don't give up!!!,"When I first started reading this novel I thought it got off to a somewhat of a slow start, and when it switched the narrators I got a bit confused. As the novel progressed and told about the relationships present between Heathcliff and Catherine I got very interested. Throughout the novel I noticed the absence of mothers present in the novel. I found that part of it very interesting and really wonder why Emily Bronte made it so that all of the children lost their mother figure. I recommend this novel to anyone who has to read a ""classic"" novel for any type of educational purpose. My only advice to anyone who reads this book is wait like 50 pages before you decide to give up on the book."
4,A classic decently bound,"For the quality of the binding - it's fair at best- the pages at the end sit jagged and uneven. But this was quite inexpensive, and it didn't bother me terribly.The book itself was good. Personally I think Jane Eyre was better, but Wuthering Heights has unusual, headstrong, and not always pleasant characters even in the role of the lovers in the story which makes it very unique."
2,A classic? Why?,"I have no memory of Northern England late 1700's. I don't no if characters such as Heathcliff or the younger Linton actually could exist. But this whole story is so unbelievable that it goes way beyond fiction. Not only that but one of the basic requisites of any successful novel, or movie for that matter, is to have at least one character that the audience likes or will root for. There is not one character in this book that I pulled for. Not one that I wanted to see come out on top. I just finished this book so maybe my viewpoint will change with time (in five months will this novel have any impact on me) but for the time being this hardly rates as a ""classic"""
3,I thought it couldnt get gloomier; then i turned the page,"My overall impression of this book is that it is a well-written depressing novel. The characters were well portrayed but the cruel and/or twisted natures of the characters made me feel dreary inside. The abominable Heathcliff is a prime example. I liked it okay, but this isnt a read over and over again type of book. however, I do think its the type of novel everyone should read."
5,Bronte wrote in this book,"""I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter - the Eternity they have entered - where life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its fulness.""One should become, to some extent, acquainted with the Yorkshire Moors, the 18th century and be fully prepared to realize that Emily Bronte was in love with death, then let her take you there. You can come back--she didn't."
4,good book,"I really enjoyed Wuthering Heights once I made it past the first 40 pages or so...that's when it really picked up. I think it was a nice story and well told. I don't want to give anything away, but it's a really good book and I definitely recommend it along with Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte."
2,Not my favorite,"I know many people love this book, but I've read it 3 times, and I just can't appreciate it. While I have no complaint with the technical aspects of it (writing style, grammar, etc.), the story drives me a little bit crazy and makes me depressed."
3,Literature classic,"I gave this book only 3 stars because I didn't consider it enjoyable reading. I'm sure some will glean much from the writing style of the author. It might be of interest to some to make a study of the different characters and try to figure out what made them as they were. With that said, most likely, to most everyone else this book would be rated with at least 4 stars. For myself, I was really glad to finish it and move on."
4,classic,Just goes to show that love stories with odd twist span the ages. Is a great story if you like stories with depth.
3,Good story,"I read this (like many of the other classics that I got) because I had never read it before. The story was okay. I know that it is supposed to be a classic, but I found it to be very depressing. But, a lot of the stories written at that time were on the depressing side. I am glad that I read it, but probably would not read it again."
2,a classic I just couldn't get into,"For me it was hard to read - the language mostly I think, but also since the names are the same for the adults as the children - hard to follow - seeing the movie helped me figure it out but I never went back to finish the book"
4,Wuthering Heights,I liked the moving descriptions of difficult life of lower class pepople.I enjoed the beautiful scenes and seasonal changes of the countrylandscaple.
5,Classic,"This was a classic novel with multiple layers and aspects that keep you interested, involved with the characters, and eager to see how it develops."
2,Dark and dreary,A depressing read about deception in all its forms. Very well written just didn't like the story but at the same time I couldn't put it down because I was hoping for something happy. Weird ending as well.
3,A Disturbing Book!,"I am thankful for the kindle dictionary. I have gained some new vocabulary for sure. Once I had discovered the darkness of the book, it was too late to stop reading. It is a compelling story. How do I give a book that has endured so many years less than a 5? I give it a 3!"
3,Wuthering heights review,Didn't really enjoy it as much as I thought. I think it was long and boring and confusing. It had some good parts but I don't think I would read it again.
4,Good read,"This was a good read and I recommend it to those who enjoy the Bronte sister's work. I gave it 4 stars because although it is a good story, I found the characters themselves frustrating. This book is not meant to be skimmed for the character names overlap and it can become confusing if not paying attention. Also, I found it hard to relate to since we do not marry our cousins nowadays. That being said there are parts of this book I enjoyed immensely and there are some great romantic quotes."
3,Missing text...jumps around text.,"This product, I do not recommend if you would like to read along with the audio CD. The audio is not word for word. It skips paragraphs and is very annoying to follow along while reading the novel.However, it is read nicely and has a pleasant narration."
3,May be a Great Movie but....,"I wanted to read this book guided my by my thought as ""it must be a great book, because Hollywood has filmed this book 4 times"". There is some misery at the beginning which drags you into the book, but especially during the second part of the book mainly the third generation of the characters I found myself reading the same type of cruelty and anger exposed by Mr Heathcliff to young generation even to his own child over and over again, so the book lost the plot and it became a blind vengeance of a man who has been tortured during his childhood. Now I'm thinking what atracted the movie makers? the blind passionate of this guy?"
5,Wuthering Heights,"This is a wonderful and unique love story, well told. Great imagination and literacy. Very capturing and highly recommended to all."
3,A Classic,"I purchased this for a college class. It was shipped on time and arrived in perfect condition. I didn't love this book, but I am not a huge Bronte fan. However, it is a classic for a reason and a good edition to any library."
2,read to say you've read it,"To get this book for free, it is a must read. If anything just to say the you have read it.I have read this book several times and I still don't see the appeal. I love books like this one(A Long Fatal Love Chase, Louisa May Alcott) but this one I just can't get into it. It seems very hard for me to follow the story. I would say read it and be you own judge."
5,"It was nicely written, held your attention, a mix of aspects",I loved this book and I could read it over and over
3,Could of been better.,"I am in the middle of the book right now, so far it has been boring but some parts were interesting. There was confusion with the part of the narrator though. It was not constant and the language used is also confusing. Overall, it could of of been better(on the other hand, the description of certain things were fantastic)."
2,"Not my kind of ""love story""",I've read a lot of the reviews below and many have said that this is a love story. If this is a love story then it is definitely is not my kind of love story. I felt that overall it was a very dark novel about horrible things happening to a variety of people. It was very difficult to get into any of the characters and overall I was fighting to get through it to the end. I love classic novels and Pride & Prejudice is my favorite but this one is not even in the same category...too dark for me.
2,I hate this book,"I read this book on the recommendation that it was the finest English language novel ever written. Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead. It's pretentious and long winded and just awful. I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots. But the main plot is boring and it hurt me to read it all the way through."
1,Don't get the hype,"Being a pretty avid reader, I thought my classic repertoire should include Wuthering Heights. I had to basically force myself to read to the end. I have no problem with despicable, morally corrupt characters. The Fountainhead is one of my favorite novels. The problem is that the treatment of them by Bronte just lacks depth. I found the book to be tediously slow, dry, and repetitive. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I really hated this book."
4,Filled with intense drama,"Depressing, obsessive, tormenting and heartwrenching. The reader is torn between either loving Heathcliff or hating him. Wuthering Heights is a very melodramatic read and it leaves you aching and unfulfilled in the end."
4,Good,"Overall a good story, although sometimes it is hard to follow because it was written over 200 years ago and is definitely written in old English. But I like to think I became a little bit more cultured, if not a bit smarter after reading it because it is a great piece of literature."
5,Emily Bronte can convert you.,"Wuthering Heights is Emily Bronte's only novel. If you are like me and normally dont have the time for sap (eg. Thomas Hardy) but perchance get the opportunity to read one 'classic', this book should be it. All the characters, including the narrator, are flawed at some level and at some level. And whom you sympathise with or hate in this book may even reveal some of your own personality."
3,Kind of a Weird Book,"Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Wuthering Heights. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used, but the characters, all of them, were mean, hateful, self-centered people. I thought it would be another book where the good guy gets tramped on as a child but comes out on top as an adult, but that never happened. People kept doing all of the wrong things for all of the wrong reasons.I'm still glad that I read it, because it was interesting, but I can't really say that I'd want to recommend it to anyone else."
1,Condition,The book I ordered was received promptly but not at all in the condition that I thought it would be in. there was writing everywhere in the book which makes it useless for the purpose I had intended. I have never had a problem with ordering books until now.
1,wierd printing orientation - it's sideways!,"Maybe I missed something when ordering, but we were completely surprised by this book when it arrived. Apparently a ""bed book"" is printed horizontally. Not what we expected. We returned it with no problem though."
2,book fan,i have always heard great reviews of Wuthering Heights. its a classic right? well i was very dissapointed. its so boring! i will make myself finish just to make sure i havent missed anything.
3,not that impressed,"this book is to be preferred to jane eyer, at least that's what statics say. i just cant agree. i would rather read the sadomasochism of jane eyer than the nonsensically wasted passion of this one.the narrator of the tale is supposed to be a man. this is the first book i ever read where i had to roll my eyes with absolute disbelief. normally, the sex of the narrator has no barring on the story at all but the way story was presented was almost childish-the story not the writing-heathclifs impassioned plea for catheine not to leave him has the tenor of a goth chick's fantasy. the whole story sounds like it started with some school girls telling a cross between ghost stories and high romance then one went home to elaborate on it and write a book.i really wasent impressed with wuthering heights at all."
1,"How on earth is this a ""masterpiece""?","Hands down, the worst novel that I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was to settle an oddly masochistic wager with a family member. The characters are all contemptible, the writing dull, and the story inane. When it was over I had mixed feelings of relief (thank God it was over) and regret for wasting that much of my life on it. What a horrible, horrible novel. If there is such a thing as hell, for me, it would be an empty room with nothing but a copy of Wuthering Heights in it."
1,How to improve this Gothic Tragedy,"The great tragedy of this book is that the author didn't kill off Catherine and Heathcliff MUCH SOONER. Then she might have been able to introduce alternate main characters who were actually interesting.Although given Emily Bronte's track record with the aforementioned losers, maybe populating her novels with characters that the reader would find interesting just wasn't her strong suit...."
1,A thoroughly boring account of boring things...,"Far too drawn out, poorly written- Not at all engaging or otherwise, this book brings on suicidal tendancies to it's unfortunate readers. The Bronte sisters are known for their works, notoriously boring and wholly uninteresting... Wuthering Heights was slightly reminiscent of a dark, boring soap opera, that made me long for the end of it..."
1,Gender Differences,"I think everyone who enjoys this book is a woman. I don't mean to sound sexist, it's just true. I've never met a woman who didn't love this book, And I've never met a man who liked it. I hated it. I won't say it was a bad book, because it's a classic, and the most you're allowed to say about a classic is that you didn't enjoy it, which I didn't. Sorry to say, this is the FIRST classic novel I've ever read that I didn't enjoy. And I've read a lot."
1,Wuthering Heights,"While this book has beautiful descriptive language, the story drags on at a snails pace, which is rather uneventful for my tastes. If you have the patience to sit through this book, by all means read this. However, if you feel you need an interesting tale that progresses at a faster pace, you'd best look elsewhere."
2,I didn't like this book.,"I didn't really like this book, because it was just boring, and I couldn't understand what they were really talking about. It just didn't interest me, and it was confusing. I didn't like the characters too much and didn't get them. I think this book could've been better, and I personally wouldn't want to read it again. I had a hard time getting into it, the whole time I was reading it. It was pretty boring."
1,Hated it.,"I know this may sound disrespectful to all of you connoisseurs of fine Brittish literature, but I hated Wuthering Heights. It was slow-moving and boring. My tenth grade English teacher required that we read it, and I have despised her ever since for wasting precious moments of my life"
2,Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte,"I love the story, but was completely surprised the book was so tiny. I think that needs to be made clear for customers."
5,Awesome,This is one of the most enduring love stories of all time. Heathcliff and Cathy symbolize longing and true love.
2,Hmm...,"It's alright, but why are all the characters so camp?Anyway, a bit melodramatic, with a bunch of despicable characters. Funnily enough, it's not as bad as it sounds."
5,Classic Literature Piece,"After having read Wuthering Heights, I watched the movie. Although the movie was really good for a classic black and white, I must say that the book (like a lot of other book-based movies) was better than the movie. However, the movie did follow the storyline fairly well, unlike most other books. Furthermore, as somber a setting that this book outlines, it is a classic that I will read again. I loved the story, and definitely would suggest this as an educational literature piece."
5,LOVE,Fast and prompt service and was exactly what I was looking for. No other place to order from. Can't go wrong with ordering from them.
1,not me,I like classics but couldn't get into this one. The style of writing is not my favorite. maybe i'll try again later
4,Wuthering Heights,"I took me a little while to get into this book because of the older English language.However, once I got by this hurdle, I found the book very enjoyable."
3,not what i expected.....,"The book is brand new and in beautiful condition, but the cover is different from the one advertised in the photo. The one online has a figure of a woman holding a piece of clothing across her body. I specifically bought this since I'm a very visual person and the picture drew me toward the book. When I received my Wuthering Heights, it was a plain and simple portrait of a landscape.... i'm rather disappointed since it was not what I ordered, but I guess it's what is in the book that counts..."
2,50 Shades of Grey,I started reading this book because of all the hype about it. I couldnt get into it at all. I stopped reading it after a few pages. Then I saw a review of it on the telly and I definitely stopped trying to get into it. They certainly didnt do the book any favours. It was badly written and the content wasnt that great. Might watch the film though !
3,Missing the Hook,"Wuthering Heights was well written, I must admit, for what it was. It never failed to convery its primary themes; jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. At the same time, it was missing the hook that captures you and makes you care whether the characters succeed or fail. I waited for it chapter after chapter until finally I couldn't seem to feel anything for Heathcliff or Cathy. I have read other works by the Bronte sisters. And while I won't discourage anyone from reading a book they are interested in, I must warn you, if you have any illusions that this will be in some way similar to that of ""Jane Eyre,"" do not waste your time."
3,"If you suffer from boredom, this may help ...","...but otherwise, there's a plentiful selection of better books to read before this one. This book contained likable and despisable characters, a rather uncommon trait these days. The plot and character interaction were at times confusing, yet really didn't go anywhere significant. Remember, old and british doesn't necessarily equal good."
5,The best book I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"No book has changed me as much as Wuthering Heights has. Its appeal for me is in its sense of otherness, something so completely removed from ordinary life. Wuthering Heights is set in a realm where ordinary morals do not apply, where love is transmitted via pain and suffering, a maelstrom of the extraordinary, which lasts for about 40 years, and then is gone. Heathcliff and Cathy must be two of the most unique figures ever created in English literature. Cathy, the spirited and vengeful heroine, who pays for her one fatal mistake with her life. Heathcliff, whose drive for revenge can only be calmed by his love for Cathy. Wuthering Heights is a microcosmos, another universe, so alien and foreign from ours. Its roughness and brutality may confuse us, but beneath the pain is love and tenderness"
3,I found this to be an alright book.,"I did not find this to be a book that I would recommend to others. It was not really my type of book to read. There were two parts that I found of intrest. In the first part of the book I found it kind of funny. When Lockwood came to live on Heathcliffs' property. Lockwood expressed his wanting to be isolated, but he kept talking to Heathcliff. Then Heathcliff interupted Lockwood and said, ""I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it-walk in!"" The other part I found it kind of weird. Cathy clams she does not make fun of Heatcliff,but she keeps making rude comments. Cathy says a one point, ""I did not mean to laugh at you."" These were the only parts that I found intresting in the book. I found them intresting because of there ironic effect."
4,A Good Book,"I was very much looking forward to a wonderfully written, romantic classic, but I was disappointed to find that the romance and love is not as moving and touching as I had expected. For one reason, the two main characters who fall in love are dislikable characters. I did not like Catherine or Heathcliff, and this made it very hard for me to enjoy the book. However, despite this, I still enjoyed this book. I do recommend it although I was disappointed."
1,KINDLE USERS BEWARE,"This is NOT the study edition referred to in the other review. It is a poorly formatted version of the book which contains nothing but the text. No table of contents or other such fanciness, and certainly no supplemental material. Just the text. Rather than spend even 99 cents on this version, get the Project Gutenberg download of Wuthering Heights for the Kindle. It is better formatted and free."
3,Sickening and fascinating,"I don't think there is any other novel out there like this. It's definitely a classic, but it's not pleasant and lovely like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or mysterious but positive like Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. As other reviers said, it's dark. It's unpleasant. It's full of anger and fighting and cruelty.And yet it is well written. It portrays well what it is meant to portray. I wish I understood it better (reading reviews and plot outlines on this page helped me immensely in this area). I definitely want to read it again sometime. I find it interesting that such a repulsive (but again, fascinating) book is such a well-known classic that almost everyone has at least heard of the title."
3,"Worth reading, but not great","As someone with a B.A. in English Literature, I can appreciate that this book has some fine writing and is a worthy classic. On the other, more personal side, I found it extremely disturbing. It is not a tale of love--in fact, I didn't witness any love between Cathy and Heathcliff. Instead, they engage in a sick, jealous, violent, obsessive relationship which ends in heartbreak and tragedy for all concerned. Heathcliff, though the ""hero"" of the story, is a dangerous, cruel, selfish, and mentally disturbed man and I was not able to feel anything for him but repulsion. Cathy is a spoiled, selfish brat.Nonetheless, it is interesting and sometimes intriguing to read, so I would recommend it if you like 19th century fiction and don't mind lots of violence and cruelty."
2,An Honest Opinion...,"Wuthering Heights is a very slow book. Not much happens and you shouldn't read it if you want an interesting story. After reading it, I feel that the book could have been shortened greatly. Even though there are some excellent themes in it, I don't see WH as an example of fine literature. Authors such as Hemingway (For Whom the Bell Tolls), Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo--Unabridged), and Frank (Alas Babylon) spin much better tales with much stronger themes and meaning. My advice: skip this book and read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo."
5,Creative romance novel mixed with firey passion,"This book is a great mix of passion, love, betrayel, and revenge.i would recommend this book to everybody. But you might want to have a dictionary handy. Be prepared to read things more than once because not all things make sense at first. if you see the movie it might enable you to understand the book better."
5,Wuthering Heights,"I am 15-years old, so Wuthering Heights was difficult to understand at first. The main difficulty was understanding the slang words and some of the phrases that were used in the ""English"" language. Once I got more into the story, I could understand what was going on. I found myself wanting to read on about the relationships between Heathcliff and Catherine, Catherine and Edgar, and Heathcliff and Edgar. These relationships were exciting to read about to see how everything would turn out in the end. I would put myself in the characters' shoes and think about how I would react to the various situations. For example, if I were Catherine, I would get rid of my need for wealth and marry for love. In Heathcliff's position, I would have accepted the fact that I would never be with Catherine and try to find happiness in my own life. This novel will entice you to keep reading to the end."
4,A wonderful reread after many years,I really would like to give 4.75 stars. I had forgotton the cruelty of Heathcliff. My only complaint is that there was too much time spent on the frivolous thoughts of Cathy's daughter. A very engrossing read. There is so much more to this story than is depicted in the movie and I highly recommend it. A true classic. I wish Emily Bronte had written more books.
3,Wuthering Heights,The old classic that I had never read but have seen the movie many times. Kindle brought me the opportunity to read the book which I would not have done otherwise. Actually quite enjoyed it.
4,Slow but fascinating story of love,"I read this book because I like the Kate Bush song and wanted to learn the story. It's quite slow-paced, as you might expect from such an old novel, but it's never boring.[SPOILER ALERT]It seems like pretty much everyone dies in it, it's natural death after natural death; the story would have been very different with modern medecine! It's easy to like characters one minute and detest them the next, plus it's quite difficult to grasp who is who initially; don't make the same mistake as me and look at a family tree because it sort of spoils the story when you find out who gets married etc.[END OF SPOILERS]It's a good story, and the final few chapters are very intense and fast-paced. Worth a read."
3,Good reading,"This classic is a little difficult to follow, but never the lessvery good. Very hard to put down once you get well into the book."
1,"Swollen, boring, bourgeois melodrama","I'm convinced that this book is considered a ""classic""because people are sheep and know they're supposed to think it is. Don't get me wrong -- I love some of the classics but this book was one of the most dull, turgid, tedious, pointless books I have ever had the displeasure of reading. To be truthful, it was such a chore to read that I could not bring myself to finish it."
1,Wuthering Heights Is Not Worthy Of Your Time,"Wuthering Heights is the worst book I have ever read. If you are forced to read it like me, get cliff notes. It might help."
2,Caos,This book did not interest me in any way. it just went on and on. its almost like it had no ending. they had way to many charactors. If you have a lot of time to read go for it and read it.`
4,"Different, but not exactly bad...","I confess that most of this book was completely over my head. There is a lot of passion in it, but it was a little to deep for me. I guess I'm more of the Jane Austen type. I'd recommend it to anyone who is intrigued by hate and dark passions."
4,Delicious,"A delicious book to read. Full of meaning and symbolism, I do wonder why no one else had understood this book at all."
2,"didn't like it until the very end, which doesn't mean it doesn't have anything to recommend it","If I were to go back and read a Bronte book, I would readJane Eyre. For 85% of Wuthering Heights I thought, This is just a book full of miserable people. I can't sympathize with any of them. I almost stopped listening (it was an audiobook) a few times. But...1. It has a lovely ending.2. It has an interesting narrative structure: The whole story is narrated by Mr Lockwood, who observes very little of the action firsthand, instead hearing most of it from Nelly (the story within a story) who hears key parts of it from other minor characters (the story within a story within a story!).3. The best of the characters love to read. How can I not sympathize, at least a little bit?"
2,Wuthering Hieghts book,"A little bit hard to read. Doesn't flow as well as some other books I have read, but still a good read never the less."
3,Wuthering Height or As the World Turns?,"Though Wuthering Heights was well-written and captivating, the plot line left a bit to be desired. The love, lust, revenge, and hatred all added up to a story resembling a soap opera. While the novel did present a powerful love story, it was one that fueled manipulative plots of revenge. Even so, the book was enjoyable. But eventually, the positive aspects of the novel were overshadowed and it became difficult to continue reading because of the layered plot. Bronte was a great writer, but her characters were merely two-dimensional entities whose goals in life were the direct result of love or hate. The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, simply because the characters seemed to represent extremes. So, while Wuthering Heights was very well-written, it didn't keep my interest. So I give it a rating a little above average."
3,Wuthering Heights--a puzzle not worth putting together.,"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte contains a complex, confusing and unreal story. Bronte begins with the end of the book, thus making readers think backwards in sequence. Also, Catherine and young Catherine become harder to tell apart as the story progresses. Bronte refers to both girls as ""Catherine"" and ""Cathy."" Another baffling subject, the coincidence that the second generation coincides with the first. Catherine, Heathcliff and Edgar's relationship corresponds to Cathy, Hareton and Linton's relationship. Also, was it per chance that young Cathy's birth and Catherine's death lie on the same day? Bronte utilizes the first generation to model the second, making the story predictable and not interesting. Carrie Chandler"
4,Wuthering Height's,"I enjoyed reading this book, though I did not find it as interesting as some of the other Brote sister's work. Emily is definatly a much better writer than Charlotte. The book Wuthering Height's reflects Emily's character very well, Emily was a very shy person who did not associate with people much outside her family. It is a shame that this is Emily's only novel."
2,"Honest opinion of an intelligent, avid reader, unforced.","The writing is not half bad, the language flows well. I'll agree with other readers, it's hard to tell who's leading the narrative. It's also hard to tell the relations of the characters until quite a ways into the book. The story does not end up satisfying the reader. It's not really even much of a love story. It's quite a hate story. I'm glad I read it, but only because it kept me from buying it."
2,It was not the most exciting book I've ever read.,"Even though Emily and Charlotte are sisters, it obvious who the better writer of the two is, Charlotte. I chose this novel for my 12th grade students to read and I decided that I would never again read it. It takes too long for everyone to realize Heathcliff is a jerk. I think that if anyone is interested in reading the Brontes to read Charlotte. If anyone is interested in reading literature from that era, read Jane Austen."
3,Have yet to read,"Downboaded to read on a trip. Haven't started yet, but look forward to this ""classic""! Unread, I gave it a 3, which is probably low."
2,Hard to get through,"I almost put the book down halfway through; it dragged very badly through the first half. The second half was beter, and was bearable, but could not make up for the first half of the book."
4,"An excellent book, but very complicated.","I enjoyed the book immensly, but felt that it was rather complicated. Too many characters with the same name. Too much writing in dialect. Overall, enjoyable."
4,Great story,What an amazing insight to the harshness of those times. I very much enjoyed it once I got going although it took a couple of chapters to do so.
5,Classic,"This was a great book! Many classics do not deserve that title, but this is definitely not one of them."
2,Average Hate Story,"I believe Wuthering Heights to be just an average book hardly capable of any noteriety. The book seems to be the same old story of a vengeful man who takes his anger and hate out on other people in a useless effort to please himself. This deep inner hatred results from the untimely death of Heathcliff's lifetime love, Catherine. The reason I gave this book a three was because it was so difficult to follow. Bronte used the same names and the same situations over and over and I could never understand who she was talking about. The theme of Man vs Man was overly developed with the continuing acts of hatred from Heathcliff. I reccomend you read this book if you want to avenge something or you withold a deep hatred for someone. EMILY SMITH"
4,Tragedy Born of Jealous Love,"I thought this book was tragic in that two people who obviously love each other very much and have so much in common that they actually refer to themselves as the other person, end up spending most of their lives in other relationships trying to make the other lover jealous or hating their choices. Ultimately, Heathcliff's desire for revenge was hard for me to understand because I suppose I have never loved anyone enough to go that far. And the end was especially tragic because he actually begged Cathy's ghost to haunt him for the rest of his life: ""...drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this dark alone where I cannot find you."""
5,"If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,","If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,_ you will probably want to swallow twice and pony up for this facsimile of the original edition of the novel. There's something breath-taking in seeing it as Emily Bronte, with only a year or so to live, saw her own work in 1847. The crudeness of the text--typos abound--somehow corresponds to the roughness of the sensibility that produced it. And since the original publisher wanted to spread it out so as to sell thicker book, it's easy on the eyes.The book is sewn in heavy, orangish cloth and feels substantial; in these days of flashy, cheaply produced volumes, this two volume set is a happy throwback."
4,Fine rendering of the novel.,"This is a well-red audiobook- the pacing is good, the enunciation is clear and the reader varies the vocal color enough to make individuals identifiable during dialogues. My only quibble is that a few characters (most notably Joseph) are rendered in dialect so authentic as to be hard to understand."
4,Book for girls,"Nice novel for rainy weekend :) I would say this one is mostly for girls. Actually this is my second time I'm reading this book, I will remember some sentences till the rest of my life."
3,The destructiveness of their love is unpalatable.,"I accept that it is one of the great books of all time but I find it too dark, too depressing, too bleak... I cannot rejoice in a love that is so destructive that it cares not for what happens to those around it, it merely obsesses about its own gain. Yes, beautifully written and constructed and I've had to read it a couple of times for various studies over the years, but I find life has enough problems so I turn to romance novels for a feeling of warmth and a brief feeling that somewhere love could be beautiful, not something you get from Wuthering Heights. The hopelessness of so many of the characters makes me uneasy and I'm left feeling as though those cold winds from those hills are blowing through me."
2,Not what it seems in Kindle,"The Longman Cultural Edition is not what you get when you buy the Kindle version. It is text only without TOC, annotations, commentary or anything else. Buyer beware."
5,Great Oldie,"Kept picturing Sir Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff and David Niven as Edgar, but Vivien Leigh instead of Merle Oberon as Cathy while I was reading this- again. It's still a great story, and the B&W movie is still my favorite interpretation of it."
3,Wuthering Heights,"This was a good story, but very hard to read. I enjoyed it, but would only recommend reading it if you happen to be an avid reader. It is definitely not appropriate for someone who isn't an avid reader."
1,A story of miserable people living miserable lives,"I know this is a ""classic"" but I got about a third of the way into and realized that I was forcing myself to read it just so that I could say I read it. Since I'm not in highschool anymore, there is no need to subject myself to such misery."
3,Wuthering Heights,I realize that this is a classic and that so many people just love it. I find myself wanting to smack some sense into the main female character. It is dark and depressing with an ending that is a slight preservation of justice.
4,Excellent.,"Before posting my review, I always read several other reviews. I swear, some people would write a review that says, ""drinking water makes my mouth wet"" and then give water one star. The Victorian novel typically isn't your light hearted, Erma Bombeck-ish literature. Yes...it is dark, brooding, mysterious, and long. It is supposed to be that way! I think it is sad that Emily Bronte died at such a young age, leaving only this one novel. In my opinion, the Victorian novel is the pinnacle of great literature and Wuthering Heights is among the best.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the language of Joseph was too difficult to understand. It took great patience for me to ""translate"" those passages. Bronte obviously wanted to describe that character by his speech and it was very effective, but it was too much."
3,The next Oprah,Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte should be on the next Oprah. There is so much love and deception in this book it would make a great topic. This is the second time I have read this book the first time was in high school and I hated the book. It was partly to do with all the Cathy's. Once you get passed who is who in the book and you understand the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff you begin to understand the book better. I found that is easier to map out the families so I knew who was who and what family they belonged to. This is truly a great novel of love and deception and is now off my bad list and on my good list.
2,Very easy to drift of and leave the book alone,"After reading this dull book, I am now able to declare Emily Bronte as the worst writer of all in the Brone family. No passion and pain like Charolotte's JANE EYRE or LUCY SNOWE of Villette, and unlike the flighty creations of Anne's novel, this one was rather hard to finish. All in all, another over rated book."
1,Why isn't this eBook free?,"If Jane Eyre is free on Kindle, then why isn't her sister's book, ""Wuthering Heights,"" free as well?It is a classic that should be available for free like so many other classics that are available for free as an eBook.Shame to the person that is making money off this eBook. (This goes for all the other ""authors"" on DTPAmazon that are selling this eBook here.)This book deserves all 5 stars, but the fact that they are selling it for a profit, brings it down to one star (I would have put zero, but it wouldn't let me).As soon as I can get my hands on a computer document for this book, I will be putting up on the Kindle store for FREE!"
2,WE NEED NEW PHOTOS,The picture above is of World Publishers' 1947 edition. It doubtless became the basis for the Fine Books edition. But IT IS NOT the Literary Society's Illustration - Free version.Buyer beware!
3,Not my type of book,I tried to read this yesterday. I've tried to read it before. The characters just don't jump out at me like I'd like them to and I gave up after 10 or so pages.
4,Beautiful covers :),"I needed to read this for an AP English class, and because of the extremely beautiful cover, I bought it. I was pleased to see it arriving on time, but I was slightly sad to see that the font was not what I expected. I usually like smaller, more squarish words, but the words in the book are rather large, sort of like large-print, and the shapes were sort of vertical-retangular. It doesn't have anything to actually do with the content of the book (which by the way, is beautiful. Who doesn't love a tale of people going insane?), but I wish that the publishers had put a nicer font in it.I'd give it a 5, but I really sort of felt disappointed over the words."
3,A heartwrenching story,"I initially read this because it was referenced in the Twilight Saga, and I had not read it. This is a heartwrenching story of people that just seem to love to be miserable. I'm all about reading ""classics"", and I'm glad that I read it, but I'll tell you, after reading it you just feel emotionally exhausted for the characters. You hope for the best for them as you're reading, but they just can't seem to get there. Not exactly a happy ending, heart warming romance, but good nonetheless."
2,Not very romantic....,"I kept waiting for this book to win me over, but it never did. I get it that Heathcliff and Catherine had a deep, passionate love for each other. But neither is a lovable character and I can't imagine falling in love with either of them. I wonder if this is a book that does not translate well from the era in which it was written to the modern day. (I think Heathcliff would be reported to child protective services in today's world.) I got through it, but it just wasn't the epic love story I was anticipating."
2,Is this whatI ordered?!?!,"Maybe I wasn't paying attention- I had no idea this would be a tiny little book (about 3""x4"") tiny little pages, tiny little print....I'll have to order another book--adult size"
3,"Footnotes, please, not end notes.","My only complaint with this Oxford version is that the explanatory notes are all at the very end of the book, not on the individual pages (ie, footnotes). The reason I like the Barnes & Noble edition of classic literature is that the notes/definitions are on each individual page."
4,Performance improves book,"One Caveat: This NOT my favorite novel. This novel is one reason I did not major in English Literature.Mr. Kitchen, on the other hand, could read the Phone Book for all I care. This is a treat: dialect that is not hackneyed or ""false"", the characters are distinct, Lockwood's gaffes and Cathy and Heathcliff's frustrated desire shine through. i get it, finally, why this is such a powerful novel."
5,Entertaining,"I've tried to read a number of Classics, and usually think people must have been awfully bored before the electronic age to slog through them and enjoy it. This was the exception. These people are so weird (and savage) it's practically like reading science fiction. A fascinating, and compelling, glimpse at what life might have been like at one time, rather than the white-washed image we usually get -- spun to our current sensibilities."
5,Did I get a good deal?,"I think so. As with most stuff in Amazon, the price compared well to anything else I could find. Throw in the shipping and lack of sales tax and BAM! Sold!They're pretty. Are they durable? I hope so. I ground up my last set one piece at a time in the garbage disposer. I'm gonna try to stop doing that."
4,"Oneida Chandler Flatware, a good value","Oneida Chandler 65-Piece Flatware Set with Wood Storage Tray, Service for 12I had seen this item at Macy's for a higher price. I am glad I was able to get it from Amazon. It is elegant, yet causual. Has solid feel as it is heavier than the cheap silverware. I also like the unique shape of the spoon.I only had it for a month but so far, it's come out shining from the dishwasher. My only negative, is that the wood storage tray seems cheap. Nonetheless, I would definitely buy this again."
3,"Best available, but not best imaginable","I use these to screw together PREDRILLED teak. Yes it is a hardwood, but these holes are predrilled. The heads still break off about 1 of every 5 screws, which is a lot. better then another brand though that is cheaper on Amazon"
5,Out of the shadows,The drum solos are phenominal This album contains a good cross section of the versatility of the shadows. I'm not a big fan of their vocals but this is one of their best overall albums
4,"""Hard to find, but worth the hunt!""","My son had been looking for this game for months. Well, I finally came to look for it here and ever since my son received this game, he's been playing it everyday. He loves it! Any child that loves hot wheels or car games are sure to love it, too."
4,Gift games,"I don't really have anything to say about the game. It was Christmas gift for my nephew. As far as I know, he enjoys playing it."
1,Horrible - DO NOT BUY,"I set the bed up and within an hour, it was leaking all over the place from a small hole in the seam. Bed did feel nice and cool, but was very lumpy - gel ""core"" must have gotten twisted somehow and I didn't know how to get it untwisted. Really, I worked and worked with the bed only to find out that it leaked! I would never tell anyone to buy something like this! Perhaps for a smaller dog it would work better - mine was the largest they make and so probably made it harder to work with."
4,Great for Huskies!,We have the large size Cool Bed and our 2 huskies love it. It is way cooler for them than laying on the carpet. Not a day goes by that my dogs are taking turns napping on the cool mat.
3,"Good, but Not Great","The GOOD:-Effective moisturizer-Absorbs quickly-Controls sebum for a whileThe BAD:-Not good for long periods of oil controlAlthough it's advertised as the combination skin formula, this moisturizer doesn't do a great job of controlling shine. My face (T-zone) get oily 2-3 hours after I've washed it, so I was looking for a light weight moisturizer to help reduce shine. This stuff works well for a few hours and keeps my skin looking ""normal"" for 3-4 hours. Beyond that and it's not effective. In fact, once the oil production has ramped up, this stuff makes my face look more oily than before. The moisturizer seems to mix with the oil to create a wonderfully glossy look. Not what I'm going for. The good news is that there is no annoying smell and it does a good job of moisturizing.Recommended: Sure, but there are probably better (though more expensive) products."
4,Very Lightweight,"I use this moisturizer when I just want a very light layer of moisture, but it is too light to be my regular daily-use. I like a creamier and just slightly heavier consistency on a daily basis so my normal one is the Sensitive Skin Neutrogena moisturizer. Not a bad product if you prefer a light gel-like lotion!"
4,Love it!,"I have combination skin that can be very oily but dries out without lotion. I used Oil of Olay for years, but they recently changed their formula so I had to switch brands. I tried this and love it! I will never go back even if Oil of Olay does. It is so light and non-greasy. I have even cut back on how often I apply anti-acne medicine under my lotion. The only thing missing in this product is sunscreen."
5,Nice product,I have always been a fan of Neutrogena. This product work great and it feels refreshing after I use it.
4,"Zac Made Being ""17 Again"" So Attractive!","I thoroughly enjoyed this fun frolic through the 'missed chances' of high school. Zac Efron handled the confusion and exuberance of youth revisited with a fun and fresh approach. I have watched this movie over and over, enjoying it each time. In addition, the actor who played the best friend, Ned, almost stole the show. He was outstanding! Three thumbs up on this one!"
2,Disappointed,"story line of going back in time/being younger has been done over and over. Not much originality here, awkward situations with family and facing up to the bully are along the lines of ""Back to the Future""."
3,No Zac Efron Commentary,Actually none of the promised BD-Live commentaries actually show up. Just the other two BD-Live bonus features.It's disappointing because Zac Efron's commentary was one of the reasons I spent the extra money on the Blu-ray.
1,"Good movie, bad DVD.","It was a marvelous movie, but the thing is thats all the DVD has. The movie, thats it. No bonus features what so ever. Not even bloopers. I expected much more from this. I guess the only exciting thing is that I can watch it in Spanish."
5,"Best show I've seen in a long, long time.","I'm pretty picky about movies I'll spend money on nowadays. I fell in love with this movie because, in the middle of so much crud coming out of Hollywood, here is a show that actually praises abstinence and encourages families to work out their problems.The humor is incredibly clever, Zac Efron nailed Matthew Perry's mannerisms and intonations, and the storyline is charming.I can't even count how many times I've watched this movie since buying it. I highly recommend it. And of course, I found it cheapest here on Amazon."
5,Not a Zac Efron fan but Movie is good!,"No thank you High School Musical or Charlie St. Cloud, but this one got me. Even though it's a bit of an overused theme (changing to someone younger or ""Freaky Friday"" style switching lives) this is one of the better ones! Everyone in the cast worked great for me except Matthew Perry who looked a little sloppy and old to me. Sorry =(. Aside from that I was shocked to see myself thoroughly enjoying a Zac Efron movie. Kudos to Zac and the production team on this one!"
5,Fun Family Fun!,"There is something I really liked about this movie and it's not necessarily Zac Efron. Although, he did show that he has range and is a great up and coming, comic actor. I really enjoyed the story. Is it completely original? No, but it is a fun update to the whole ""It's a Wonderful Life"" storyline with fun performances by the core cast. It certainly is worth checking out even if you aren't a big Zac Efron fan like me."
3,Better than expected...,"I grew up watching films like this...Freaky Friday, Big, 18 Again and so on.I wasn't expecting anything new from the plot or story premise so it was up to the actors and screenwriting to carry this through.And they did.Though this didn't receive 'rave' critical review, it was quite cute and highly entertaining. The cast was well assembled and Zach Efron was surprisingly funny, especially opposite ""Lt. Dangle"" (Tom Lennon).I actually read a review somewhere that Efron lacked 'edge' in this role...ummm, what? Was 'edge' really necessary? I didn't think so. He was adorable and funny and what more does one need for entertainment?I watched this with my husband and mother-in-law and we all agreed to its entertainment value as qualifying as 'cute and funny'."
3,Eh...,"I adore this movie, the only downfall is that it is very scratched and skips through out some parts. I was disappointed but I am a movie freak so I suppose I can deal with a scratch or two."
1,MOVIE DOESN'T WORK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"MOVIE ONLY PLAYS FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN STOPS AND NEVER PLAYS AGAIN, AND CANT EVEN GET MY MONEY BACK NOW..."
5,Thank you.,I really appreciated you getting my DVD out to me quickly. This was a gift for my daughter and getting it before her birthday was wonderful. Thank you for your timely service.
5,17 Again,This was an excellent revision to George Burns version of 17 Again in the 80's. Zac Efron did a great job as well as Matthew Perry. These are two very talented actors who followed in very big footsteps. Some of it i would not recommend for children under 13 because of the decade change. Other than that one great movie.
2,More of a Teeny Bopper Movie,"This movie was a dud. There have been so many previous movies made with the same story line, this is nothing new or orginal. This should have been a TV movie. It has a feel that the target audience was supposed to be junior high school age kids. Matthew Perry really isn't in the movie very much.The story is very predictable. The characters are uninteresting. Perry's cousin in the movie is just plain stupid. The character adds nothing to the story.I rented this one, but it wasn't even worth the nominal rental fee. No wonder it bombed in the theater."

4,Solid 4.0 for a lighweight film,"No wonder Mike is an old, bitter cynic at age 40. If I went from looking like Zac Efron to Matthew Perry, I'd be most unhappy, too. What a funny, sweet and endearing movie. Zac Efron is more than just blue eyes and hair and his best friend (Thomas Lennon) is hysterical. He also gets a storyline that's just as enjoyable. What I liked about it a lot is that Efron's character Mike, is still in Dad and husband mode in his interactions with his family. Efron does a good job affecting the mannerisms of someone who is older than 17. And as a ""Scarlett"" myself, my ""Mike"" went from ""yeah, I wish I could do it all over again, too"" at the beginning to ""marrying you is one of the best things I ever did."" Awww."
4,17 Again and Again,I watched this movie several times and each time it was funnier. Zach Efron is a very good actor and I think he will go far in this business. He's also not bad to look at.
4,So many versions...but this one works,"As the years pass by we se the same subject being tackled again and again.But because the story is itself a kind of fantasy tale, this usually bringsme in for a view.Yes we know the story, we know how its gonna end. Pleasantly surprisehow the direction of this film went. Good smart script, good acting usually presents a good movie, and because the silly scenes or situations were keptat a minimum this became a very good movie.So if your into these types of movies, you should be able to enjoy thisone pretty good."
4,Cute Movie,"The storyline was predictable, as other movies like this storyline but I enjoyed this movie. Good acting and it had a feel good ending which I enjoyed.I give it 4 stars as it was predictable, but I wasn't bored watching it and would watch again :)"
4,THIS IS NOT HSM.... THANK GOODNESS!,"I admit, High School Musical videos and media overexposure for Zack Efron makes me want to poke my eyes out with a fork. I thought this would be a poser knock off trying to capitalize on Efrons popularity with people too young and simple minded to know any better. I was surprized. This a very entertaining movie. I think the studio made a huge mistake in overbilling Efron. They might as well called it the Zack Efron movei! That is not to say he didn't do a good job. He did. TV child stars are notorious for being over hamy on the big screen. I think he showed that he is capable of being a legitimate movie actor. The rest of the cast really make this show as well. It is very funny, even a little moving at times. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and yet is not a glorified TV episode from Nickolodian or Disney. Just the right tone!"
4,Good Movie,Light entertainment for the teenage set. Fairly basic plot and light comedy that can be watched by the whole family. Kids enjoyed it.
4,Cool movie,"This is a cool movie with no ""sing alongs"" like High School Musical. Its fun and enjoyable."
5,Truly entertaining,"Excellent story and acting. Even though the story is a stretch, it mixes serious undertones with very good comedy. The movie provides the spirit with a genuine lift."
4,I Was Pleasantly Suprised,"My wife forced me to watch this movie with some friends. I actually enjoyed watching the movie. Honestly Ned made this movie for me, he was hilarious. We rented this movie and the next day ended up buying it."
3,20YO in High School???,"trying to figure out the math in this one, he goes bak 20yrs to his g/f being pregnant... hmmmm, well, who cares, you can't pay too much attention to the details in this flick b/c the comedy gems are rare but my first review of Zac is actually most impressive... the courtroom speech sealed the deal, very convincing and guess since I have yet to see an actor who can even hold a candle to Leonard Whiting, this is as close as it gets, I'll take it.... kinda inappropriate sexual situations that are too close for comfort.... didn't like when Perry comes back to the wife, maybe 3pc suit and haircut and keep Zac! lol the 19 face slaps were the most inane, but enjoyed the elvish!"
3,Pleasant and harmless romcom,"This story has been redone numerous times. This time our hero, a 37 year old father of two, stays in the present day but changes to a 17 year old body of his youth. There are the usual stupid premises. For example, even his about to be divorced wife isn't really sure he looks a lot like the boy she married. It isn't until the end of the movie that she breaks out a picture. The always effective Leslie Mann plays the now grown up wife and surprise...Zac Efron does a nice job in the 17 year old body of Matthew Perry. Pleasant and harmless stuff.The Blu ray looks very good. The aspect ratio is 2.40:1 with 1080p resolution. Everything is surprisingly crisp and clear. The audio is a clear, clean Dolby TruHD 5.1."
5,hahaha xP,This movie is AMAZING! I love it and it is one of my favorites! It is SOO funny!!! You should definitely buy it! ;]
3,truth in advertising,"Product worked ok (elastic topped strainers are better)This is a big nylon sock and serves its purpose by removing particles and lumpy paint. Price too high for only 1 sock. Shipping was also to much considering it was shipped in a flat rate envelope. Shipping weight was indicated at 1.1 lbs, Thought I was purchasing a box of 25 as shown in ad. Part #11313 indicates a box of 25 5 gallon strainers. Checked other vendors to verify this. Ad was changed after I indicated my dissatisfaction in experience. But no resolution was attempted by vendor. They should sell as advertised or be more clear. This product was misrepresented by vendor."
1,Not a Book for Running Injuries,This book does not discuss hamstring or quadricep injuries. These two muscle groups are by the far two of the most important for runners. Because of this I do not recommend this book!
2,Good performance ruined by engineers,"The dynamic range on this CD drove me crazy. All of the intimate scenes are done at such a low volume, that you have to crank your player up to hear it at all. Then any fortissimo knocks you across the room. While it sounds like a very good performance, I found I had to keep my hand on the volume control the entire time. I even returned the CD and got another, thinking it was the pressing."
2,Recording Ruined by Engineers,"This is rated one of the best if not the best performance of La Boheme but the fluctuation of the sound dynamics ruined it for me. In order to listen to this recording, you must constantly raise and lower the volume on your stereo. It would have been preferable and more pleasurable for me to have bought another performance of La Boheme rather than this one."
4,very much fun,"Great little film with wonderful cast.Interesting plot development, good resolution to the story. Actors all wonderful, as we expect from a cast like this.Recommended!"
4,INCORRECT TRACK LISTING,"The track listing for this Pair release of Fire & Smoke is incorrect. There are four songs missing from the original Fire & Smoke album: Too Much Noise (Trucker's Waltz), Smokey Mountain Memories, This Time I've Hurt Her More (Than She Loves Me) and Tell Me Why. This CD is good, but not what I thought I was buying.RCA... Please re-release the original Fire & Smoke CD. It's a great album!This is the correct track listing.1. Somewhere Between Right And Wrong2.

4,avant-garde electronic composer,"Eduard Artemyev is regarded as the most firmly established among Russian composers of electronic music. Artemyev has composed numerous works varying from electronic avant-garde to film music. He is probably best known for his collaboration with famous Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky composing music for his films: ""SOLARIS"" in 1972, ""THE MIRROR"" in 1975 and ""STALKER"" in 1979; and with such filmmakers as Andrei Mikhalkov-Kontchalovskiy and Nikita Mikhalkov."
4,Awesome,"This game brings me back to my high school days. I never had the opportunity to finish the game in high school. Now that I own it, I have to make time to play it like I used too. I'm just happy I could find it. It looks just like it did back in the 90s. That's what I love about it."
5,Loved this game,I don't think I ever spent as much time on any game as I did this one. The worm used to scare the c___p out of me. But mainly I just enjoyed the gameplay which was challenging but not overly difficult to figure out.
3,Dune 2000 Game Review,"Similiar to the WarCraft/StarCraft type games, but not as cleanly engineered. Certainly enjoyable for all fans of The Dune Universe.The saga of Dune continues..."
2,"Looks good, but...","The game looks good and has some nice control features, but it is exactly the same game as Dune 2 in content."
4,Very different,I was not well read about Swedenborg so I decided to look this book over and was very glad I did. A very complex thinker and indepth reading is required. The price on kindle makes it a win-win situation.
1,Pretty good but emmmm no,"Im sorry but I have listened to this over and over and I cant seem to appreciate the bad words. My son enjoyed it, until I took it away from him, bad descition because now he sings it all the time and makes fun of me. Please dont buy this cd unless you like bad words. ha he ha he"
5,where it all began...fu*kin tha police,"This was the start of gansta rap.It was a social statement.It laid down the foundation for Tupac,Snoop,and other west coast rappers. All 3 ni**as with attitudes went on to great careers.Id like to see Ice Cube and Dre do more together.The only album I can compare to this is ""The Chronic"" which was made by Dre, a member of the group.THis is the best album ever.It didnt get any airplay on the radio or MTV-but it still sold mad records"
5,You're my H.y.m.s.absolutely wonderful,"What is there to say,I like all the songs,text,sound, band the 2 guys were great fr.day one.Is there only the CD available?How do I find out,I am a dummie.I hope they never break up again,and at least its a pleasure to look at them,not a throwup with all the disgusting looks and behavior,but there are lots of sickos.I wish they would come here once,but I think they are doing quite well in Germany ,so why here they might be to nice and proper looking at least they have STYLE,these cuties,they are great.Now this is really not a review right?its a comment fr.an old lady who loves and adores them.I hope once to see them live,where is a page where one finds out?I am trying for month,"
5,beautiful,"I love these suncatchers, at this price they are wonderful gifts for friends and co workers! They love to receive them as presents."
1,Chips & Packaging Issues,"I read through the reviews for these for hours before deciding to take a chance. I figured by now they would have solved or fixed their packaging issues in order to keep the crystal from fracturing during shipping. WRONG! All four of my prisims came chipped! They were shipped loose in a box that could have fit 20 of them easily, so they had plenty of room to roll around and hit each other since the shipper decided not to use ANY padding at all! I will NEVER buy from them again since it's obvious they are not listening to their customer reviews and don't respond to direct contact."
5,We love them,"Wow, the sun just makes beautiful reflections all over the room! The price is great and they make great gifts!"
5,What sparkle!,"I hung a few of these crystals in front of the stationary side of a atruim door in my dining room.Every morning my dining lights up with rainbows, it makes me smile. Even my husband likes them!"
5,"good quality, good service",This beautiful lead crystal sun catcher is a delightful addition in our kitchen window. It casts dozens of bright rainbows when the sun hits it. The shipping was quick and the price is much better than you'd find in any brick and mortar store.
4,rainbows all over my blues...,great price for these light refracting geodesic cut glass. loads of color float around the room when the sun hitshang from fish line
3,LOTS of facets equals more but paler rainbows,"I did not know that the intensity of the rainbows diminishes when you create more of them by increasing facets. Makes sense, though."
5,So beautiful!,These swarovski crystals are soooo beautiful and they arrived way before schedule and they came from another country! I can't wait to give them as presents! Thank you!!!!!!
5,great prism,"I was very happy with this crystal ball prism. I ordered another prism as well, and this one was a far better deal. It creates rainbows, it's hefty, and ... yeah, I just like it. I think it could make a great gift for someone."
5,Lovely Interludes,"If you like Bartok's violin concertos you will most likely enjoy these as well. The first charms from the beginning with twittering woodwinds and chimes and it does maintain a somewhat fairy tale atmosphere. You have the samples to convince you further. I've owned a copy for I don't know how long and the music always sustains me. My appreciation of these pieces continues to grow over the years and so might yours. Not that much competition in these works so let's be thankful for what we have. Sir Simon thought it was worth doing so why shouldn't you? It's all easy listening ear candy. If you, however, find Bartok's and Prokofiev's violin concertos too dissonant for words, then these are not for you either for they belong very much in that same sphere."
1,Not What I Expected,Based on the picture I expected a wider base for this frame to sit by itself. The base is thin and therefore the frame can tip over easily. There is no support on the back of the frame to keep it from tipping over. For the price this product is very cheaply made. I would not waste my money on this item.
5,Have a Little Faith,This album is awesome. Have always loved the Staple Singers music but Mavis has written beautiful inspiring gospel music that makes you feel and think and feel really close to God. I heard God is Not Sleeping on tv and had to have it. I've played it over and over. Love the album.
2,Amateurish but well intentioned,"It was develped from a good premise and veered into a companion to the school sisters of Christian charity guidebook. Another more professional volume of this nature is necessary and one would hope Mr.. Paulos will then be a contributor rather then ""author""."
2,"Nice photos, purple prose hard to swallow.","Filled with enchanting photographs from days gone by, ""Behold the Women"" is nice to look at but a simply awful read. Having created a montage of nostalgic photographs from ""the old days,"" e.g., pre-Vaticann II, the author felt obligated to annotate his montage with would-be paens to ""the good sisters"" from a grab-bag of assorted clerics and laity. The majority, if not all, of the photographs contained therein were archival and as such, lose some of their historic significance, as their documentation is nil. Whoever designed this book, and I fear it might be Mr. Paulos himself, violated just about every fundamental principle of book design - it's so naive, it's almost charming! If you can skip the saccharine prose and just focus on the photographs, ""Behold the Women"" supplies about 15 minutes of visual gratification."
2,At best these are okay performances...,"...of these pieces...for some reason some of the recordings have a particularly dry sound -- ""Hora staccato"" and ""Valse scherzo"" sound like the bow was haired with sandpaper...much better performances can be found elsewhere -- look for Michael Rabin and, of course, Heifetz."
1,Double Trouble,It gets a bit annoying after a while. It gets to the ending way to fast and it takes a while to get to the problem. It seems unrealistic that the kids would have that much freedom.
1,Worthless,This an incredible story. The acting is highly exaggerated & superficial. What happens & how it ends has a lot to do with the suffocating atmosphere in Iran. This film is entirely worthless & watching it is a total waste of time.
4,Hang on to those Handlebars!,"While not new to racing sims,(NASCAR, CART, Formula 1, Need for Speed), I am new to motorcycle racing. It takes a little getting used to, but ultimately it's great fun. The graphics are really nice,and the realism levels are impressive. I went the whole nine yards and practiced on every track in order to learn how to handle those awesome bikes.Once I gotpretty used to handling characteristics and course layouts, I did did some racing...and even at rookie settings it's a challenge until you get going. Not real crazy about the bike engine sound files,and the heavily multi-layered interface, but it cooks once you're into it. The AI for the competitors sometimes seems a bit ""too good""...but then again I'm still learning. Have fun!"
1,DO NOT GET IF U HAVE WINDOWS 95!!!!!!!!,ok I have Windows 95 (it is an HP) and it says that it works on Windows 95. when I installed it the computer shut off and it crashed!!! DO NOT GET SUPERBIKE!!!!
2,Not what I needed,I didn't enjoy the style of writing. The information was interesting to some extent. It didn't give me the insight I was seeking.
2,Lost interest right away,"Sorry, but this was boring to me. Couldn't get through it. After you are beaten up in the first chapter for not being perfect enough for the angels to help you out, why bother?"
5,best parrot food on the planet...just ask Desmond,"I have always used Harrison's food for my parrot and my cockatiels.I use the coarse for the parrot,and fine for the 'tiels.They are all extremely healthy.The food always arrives in perfect,fresh condition,and lasts if you keep it properly stored.I won't feed them anything else.They won't eat anything else as far as manufactured bird foods go.I supplement their diet with treats of sweet potatoes,baby carrots and various other fruits and vegetables.I know I don't have to feed them anything besides Harrison's,because it is perfectly formulated and they could exist on just it,but I wanted to add a little variety to their diets.My birds and I are very well satisfied with Harrison's,in all its permutations."
4,Doro Machine to machine,"This is Doro's forlay into the industrial rock scene that was way popular in the 90's in Europe. While not a straight out metal record it has rich multi track laying of the guitars and drum beats,witch makes for some great grooves on this cd. Tunes like, Whiskey straight,Welcome to the tribe,I want you & Machine to machine are stand out tracks. This is by far Doro's most sexually suggestive cd. It would work very well in a strip club setting. Very suggestive,with dance beats but heavy riffs! If you are a fan of Doro's i highly suggest this disc. because its like no other cd she has recorded."
5,The best one around...,"Yes, this is another Diana Ross/Supremes Compilation but it is unique in it's own way. The only problem is in the sequence of the songs, the album keeps jumping from one song to another without having that harmonious blend... but who cares, the songs are ""Digitally Remastered"". It's been ages since I heard those old Supremes songs in STEREO. That old hiss (clearly heard on other Ross compilations) is eliminated, the vocals are clear and background orchestrations are splendid (especially on track 16 ""It's My Turn"").Don't pass it by. Just BUY IT!"
1,Warning don't buy this if you live in the USA,"I wish I had read the reviews and seen that the DVD won't play on US DVD players. The seller and Amazon specifically omits this key piece of information and therefore is misrepresenting the product. Additionally, the CD case arrived smashed and cracked. At least the CDs play and the music is great, I just wish I could see the concert."
1,Seek (further) and you shall find ... a good reggae tribute,I bought this CD with high expectations being a lover of both reggae and the Beatles. It has mediocre renditions at best. If you would like an excellent reggae tribute CD seek out Reggae Celebrates the Grateful Dead Vol 1. It is not that easy to find but is well worth the effort. Vol 2 is easier to find although not quite as good as Vol 1. But either one is still better than this CD.
2,meh,"i thought i would like this album a lot more than i do. reggae and the beatles, but some of the songs come across as cheesy cruise ship covers. i really wanted to love it, but it is just ok"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,First. The production sounds terrible. Second. The music sounds even worse. It has a very slick production sound that lends itself to bubble gum sort of music. Not Reggae. I thought it was a joke at first but it is not. We resold it after we bought it.
1,"Bad, stupid, false","I'm a lover of Beatles music and I was very looked forwad to this album. But it's bad, stupid and false muzak, not tribute to Beatles by good reggae band. It's fault I bought it by Amazon. It's mistake this ""music."""
1,WASTE OF MONEY TOO,"This cd should be called ""Stay apart"". Unknown artists singing forgettable music by a great group. I got this cd with the rest of the series and all I can say is THIS CD IS BORING! Save your money. There are so many good Cdz on the market. Check out Peter Tosh or something good. The production is tinny also. Reminds me of a cheap car radio."
1,Menthol Problematic!!!,"Product did not work too well for me. Left my face very dry and caused it to peel. I could have lived with it since I use a facial cream after cleansing, but the Menthol in the product was unbearable. My face kept feeling like it was burning and it wasn't pleasant. As soon as I applied this product I had to rinse it off immeditately as to minimize the effects of the Menthol and pray it got nowhere near my eyes. I have since switch over to Neutrogena's Grapefruit cleanser and have been having excellent results after only 3 days of use. I actually no longer need to use a facial cream after using it!"
5,Super product with many uses!,"I use this product to deep clean my face; however, it is an excellent to exfoliate any part of your body--legs, feet, hands, etc. It's gentle enough for the face, yet excellent enough to use anywhere effectively."
4,it's good,"i like this wash its very good, i have a lot of blackheads and it does work to clear them up and leaves your face feel very very clean."
4,Awesome,Great product I used it for a couple of weeks and helped clear my face. I have two tone skin oily and dry so worked for me .
2,Makes me break out,"I like this cleanser, it feels good, is reasonably priced, and seems to clean well. The problem I have with it is that it has salicylic acid, which for some reason actually makes me break out. For this reason I had to stop using it."
4,Party of my evening face care ritual,"Neutrogena's deep clean cream cleanser is an absolute essential step in my daily face care routine. I use this every night before going to sleep, and I don't feel clean and know all my make-up has been removed until I use this. The best part is, while I know it's thoroughly removing all the make-up from the day, I don't feel like it leaves my face dried out. Will definitely continue to use this product.My only complaint is I wish it was sold in smaller quantities because I travel a lot and often only need a carry-on. I hate trying to transfer this into a smaller container."
3,I really wanted it to work,"I used this for a long, long time. I love the creamy texture, the fresh/tingly feeling it leaves and the way it smells, but it seemed to have made my acne worse. First it made my skin dry and a little flaky, but that stopped once I switched from using it twice a day to once at night. Then I noticed I was getting small pimples on my forehead and cheeks. After washing with the cleanser my face was soft and the smaller pimples disappeared. Somewhere throughout the day the small pimples would come back and grow into whiteheads. Even after it broke me out I continued to use it, thinking my skin would get used to it and clear up eventually but I was wrong. It's great for acne on other parts of the body though, I use it on my chest and back in the shower and it clears up breakouts and makes my skin smooth. I might try it on my face again in the summer when my skin isn't so dry, since it's a lot of cleanser to waste."
2,"Good Cleansing, NOT WITH MENTHOL!!","The Neutrogena Oil Free Deep Clean Cream Cleanser does a good job of deeply cleansing your face. You don't need alot and it feels nice on the skin UNTILL the menthol kicks in. This is the ingrediant to have a ""refresheing""feeling. To me, my skin did not like the menthol ingrediant and irritated my face. Also the scent of the menthol is not pleasant to me. The cream cleanser did not dry out my skin and if not for the menthol I would have continued to use this product. I guess I should have looked at the ingrediants on the back before I purchased this product. We as consumers need to be informed with the necessary information in order to make the best purchasing decision for ourselves and our families.I gave this product two stars due to the menthol in this product.Susan, Omaha, NE"
5,Best face wash I've been able to find.,I have moderately oily skin and like to wash my face a couple times a day. This face wash is astringent enough to remove the oils and still allow me to use it a couple times a day without completely drying out my face.
5,Great Voice - Beautiful Performance,"We recently viewed this video again after several years, and it was worth viewing over and over. The show is elaborate but not over done, and Mariah sings the songs that first brought her to the top.I was convinced for a while that Mariah was average, but after seeing American Idol and hearing her on the radio again, I know that few women are blessed with her voice. My taste is heavy rock, and I bought this video years ago for my wife, but I am so glad we kept this video. Talent is talent. I know many of the songs are remakes - good choices and very well done.I am sure if you are an old Mariah Carey fan you will especially like this performance - sold out Madison Square Gardens."
5,THANK GOD! GO MARIAH,"Im Very Happy As All The Mariah Fans That This Very Video Is On DvD Now,I Must Say I Love Everything About this Video She Is Amazing Thats It;Plan And Simple. Mariah Carey Is God! She Is My Fag Hag!! (LOL) I Have Worn Out My VHS Of This And Im One Of The Many That Has Purchased It!!"
5,I DON'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS THE TALENT!!!!!,"SHE'S THE BEST , ALWAYS AND FOREVER . WHO SAYS THE CONTRARY IS JUST BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT WHOM I'M TALKING ABOUT............IT'S THE DIVA , MARIAH CAREY .SHE IS ON MY HEART SINCE I WAS 10 . NOW I'M 16. SHE'S ALWAYS ON MY MIND."
3,"I liked the video,espically when she laid across the stairs.","I think that She was a very good viedo maker when she was married but know she has gone to far with her exibiationist but sence then i havent bought any more cd, tapes or any other products form sony She has made me lose the will to live."
2,Get Real,"Mariah Carey has long been looked at as one of my idols. I thought how she was doing something that she loved and didn't worry about having to ""lip sync"", due to the fact she has a marvelous voice. I was wrong. Mariah Carey was obviously ""lip syncing"" in this video. All of the songs sound just as they did when they were released. I begining to think she has lost her confidence."
4,Mariah Carey Fantasy at Madison Square Garden.,"I have a recorded version of this from when it aired on FOX but it was also presented in Tokyo, Japan, I like the parts in Tokyo better too bad they don't have a DVD for that. I thought be getting this DVD there would be songs that weren't exactly aired on the FOX special but NO its the same thing. It is an excellent performance she is BEAUTIFUL but the audio is so corrected. What is the point of calling it LIVE if you are correcting the audio??? They totally do that on her low harmonizing voice....other than that I like it, watched it twice, I'm done."
5,For those who know nothing of Mariah Carey,"With no regard to other aspects of her career, of which I know nothing, Fantasy proves a fine showcase for a personable singer with the gospel sound in her voice. The 60 minute duration allows no time for a letdown or lull in entertainment quality as the star and a sizable cast sing and dance their way into one's favor. Ears unaccustomed to the intonations of the voice, which sacrifices clarity to vocal embellishment, in the common modern mode, will still find pleasure in the performance. Whether one enjoys the brief insertions of the star ""up front and personal"" is a matter of taste. There are not enough to cause a measurable degree of frustration for most viewers. Over-all, a show easy to recommend."
3,Not so great,"Fantasy DVD was quite a letdown based on my expectations. Columbia didn't do enough to showcase the exceptional talent of Mariah Carey. Considering that she was at the peak of her singing career when this NY concert was launched, I was expecting better sound recording, and video editing. It seems to me that this DVD was done in haste."
2,Where's the real DJ Bobo?,"This album lacked the emotional dance NRG ""Bobo"" sound. Instead, I recommend the songs ""Pray"", ""Freedom"", and ""Let the Dream Come True."""
2,headache inducing fragrance,"It's too bad that I cannot find out the effectiveness of the product, because I cannot get pass its strong fragrance."
5,Outstanding,"A touching and inspiring documentary that shows how people of two different cultures in one community have come together to heal the wounds of the past. If you've ever been haunted by the depredations made on American Indians in U.S. History and wanted to make a difference for good today, this video provides a model for how that can happen. I highly recommend Two Rivers."
4,worth the watch,"This documentary is well worth watching. These are real individuals and tribal peoples ( I know one of them). The process of reconciling is balanced with its ""pluses"" and its ""on-going"" work."
3,indian lives,"although some documentaries are educational to watch to a point, does anyone know of an actual movie of the lives of the american indian and there fight to be a free people and live in peace? would like it to be something made in past 30 years. would seem that hollywood can make a best seller cartoon, but nothing to do with real history of our past."
3,Authentic medieval gaiety and dances from the british isles....,"For the die-hard medieval music and celtic niche fans. This pristine early music cut on mythical platform of meadows and unicorns may not necessarily appeal to fans of the internationally acclaimed bestseller ""Celtic Guitar"" which has a wider appeal and easy listening staying power."
3,"These songs would have improved ""Do The Collapse""","Ric Ocasek produces 6 of the 9 songs on this EP. Unlike on ""Do The Collapse"", his production is understated and doesn't overwhelm. No overdose of keyboards here. Actually, more like 3.5 stars. One reviewer for DTC mentioned that Pollard must have lost his White Album. He must have found it before recording 'Tropical Robots' and 'A Crick Uphill' which are more acoustic-based. 'Avalanche Aminos' is the highlight. Overall, better understated production and better material than DTC."
5,GBV Goodness,"If you've enjoyed either of the two latest offerings from the Bob & Doug team-up, you need this EP. Other than the title track, 'Underground Initiations' is straight-ahead-rock ""Do the Collapse"" material, while 'Fly Into Ashes' and the acoustic 'A Crick Uphill' both sound like outtakes from ""Speak Kindly of Your Volunteer Fire Department."" My vote for the best track, though, is the stellar 'Avalanche Aminos': hand-claps, Bob's double-tracked vocal bridge, and the incomparable combination of Doug Gillard's incredible songwriting and the drive of the GBV rhythm section make this song the highlight of a fantastic EP."
5,Extremely valuable,"My accidental encounter with an earlier edition of this book was the catalyst for my taking up film studies. The book is a clear, well written and systematically organized history of movies. It has a comprehensive and up to date bibliography and filmography. Chapters are chronological in sequence, but are organized around a particular theme. The authors introduce major influences in the cinema (whether directors, 'schools', actors or events), identify principal directors and films, and analyse major issues and advances. It is an excellent introduction to the history of movies and great jumping off point for further, more specialised study. It is refreshingly free from post-modernist jargon and abstractions. If you want a comprehensive introduction which is also a good read, I recommend this book most highly."
5,Still the definitive film history text.,"As a writer, Mast is without equal as a teacher, historian, and critic. The most readable, valuable film history text, in my opinion. Thank goodness it's still in print."
1,A Short History with snoring,"This was a required text for an Intro to Cinema class I took at college. To put it bluntly Gerald Mast is a bore. I've never met the guy so I'm not going to comment on what I haven't seen but I have attempted to read his writings and fell asleep before I could finish the first paragraph. I'm an avid reader and have no indications leading me to believe I have ADD or ADHD but this was simply put the worst text I have ever seen about film. The author's subject matter is not only unappealing but at times also irrelevant. For example, Mast dedicates numerous pages to many shallow commercial filmmakers and leaves one paragraph for Stanley Kubrick. I'm sorry but Stanley Kubrick's impression on the medium is worth more than a paragraph. All in all a very boring read."
1,too much information!!!,"This book should only be read by master level film students highly interested in every single director, film and plot summary of every movie ever made. There are no summaries of the main points and this book should NEVER be used as a college core classroom book. I have never been so bored and overwhelmed by such trivial and useless information in my life!"
4,"bicycle rack bag nice bag, depends on what you use it for.","The Bag is nice, very good quality, but it is not so good for books. I bought it for my son, he uses it to carry his chain and lock. He still has to use a back pack for his heavy books. It falls over a lot and needs to be repositioned. It was a very good price. It is kind of thick and keeps your water bottle colder, than if you put it on your bike mount."
1,Doesn't strap onto rack securely,"I got this rack bag to replace another I had which had gotten holes in it after years of use. My previous bag had thick horizontal straps which held the bag securely to my rack, but this bag just had two skinny little vertical straps which didn't hold the bag to my rack without use of a bungy cord (not provided). I sent this product back but the seller stiffed me on a refund. Though I had just used it once, they would only give me half of what I paid for it. I found another bag I had around the house (not a rack bag) that I now put on my rack using bungy cords. If I have to use bungy cords to hold a bag on, I rather have a larger bag than this one which was supposedly made for bike racks."
5,Kabar pearl harbor version,"The full size Ka-Bar fighting knife. A great knife with my choice of commemorative printed on it. Mine got here quickly, and the Ka-Bar quality is still there. More of a collector piece than a working knife, but I still like it. I recommend one of these commemoratives to anyone. Happy camper here."
4,global warning rules,"Rascalz rule, global warning rules, did I say rascalz rule. this cd is one of the best hip-hop cd's in Canada... of cores there realy arnt many of them. But still this is better than a lot of american rap albums, and thats all I have to say."
1,Big Deal,"i don't know why Canada hypes this crew up so much. It sounds like they just copied everyone else. the Beatnuts song is good, though, cause of the Beatnuts. Yeah Juju and Les! what a letdown"
2,great unit while it works,"The GL 6+ worked fine from March to November. It quit producing any hot water for Thankgiving. Amazon is not involved in returns for warranty. That's OK, but Bosch the maker has the worst Customer Service phone service I have ever encountered. After 30 minutes on the worst hold screeching music I briefly talked to a human, and was cut off after less than a minute. Maybe the email I sent them will recieve a better treatment. My take on such things is buy the unit use it, and if works for 6 months count your blessings, and be prepared to throw the unit in the trash - forget stupid claims of warranties that require an act of God to be honored."
4,Nice water heater,Point of use for the bathroom works great as an additional water heater when tankless is used. It would have been better if an option was available for mounting it on a wall in the horizontal position - bracket for mounting is for vertical mount only.
2,water heater,"The unite was defected or it was damaged in shipping.It was leaking water as soon as was pluged in, it's returned for replacement or credit.Al"
4,Ariston Water Heater,I ordered the Ariston 6 as a replacement for my 5th wheel water heater. It is limited to electric only but the price differential between the original propane water heater and the Ariston was my deciding factor. I have another Ariston that is smaller and is used just for my washing machine that has worked for several years with no problems so the choice for replacing the original propane heater or choosing another route was an easy one. Since Installing the Ariston 6+ I have more hot water for a longer time than I have ever had with the original water heater. I have a generator or an electrical hook up at all times so there is no negative effect on making the choice. I would recommend Ariston product to anyone and to those with RV products who need to replace an original propane water heater....go for it. I regret that I did not make the transfer sooner.
5,easy set up,"Bought a place that had no hot water to one bathroom on the far end of the house, and needed something quick and easy so the kids could have warm showers. Looked everywhere, and this Ariston 6 gal turned out to be the best bet. It's just enough heat, without running new power lines or new plumbing. (Probably not great for cold weather climate showers or long soaks, though.) Was easy to install and it's been about a month with no problems so far."
2,Customer No Service,The unit I have had for a number of years started to produce less hot water. I called customer service to talk to a technician. I was told I had to be an electrician before they would answer questions. Now why would I have my electrician or plumber call? The whole idea is to avoid a service call. Customer no service Boasch!
2,Not great,This may have come to me used and faulty but my experience has been underwhelming. Hot water temp is about a 6 or a 7 compared to normal heated tap water and the heated reservoir seems to expire well below the 6 gallon amount. Sadly it's stuck to my wall not going anywhere anytime soon.
5,Works perfectly!,I bought this water heater to replace a small water heater located in my garage to service my washer. Being able to mount it on the wall was very helpful. It was relatively easy to install and works perfectly with my new high-efficiency washer.
5,NOT the Bass Player,"If you are not a jazz fan, don't read this. If you are looking to buy that one album that is not in your collection for the bass player, Avishai Cohen, then you may need to know that this is a different person who also plays jazz on a different instrument.Actually, I bought this without knowing that it was not the Bass genius. I play bass, but also trumpet, lucky me. AC shows a technical ability that is stunning. Only comparison is Roy Hargove. This guy is pegging the chop-o-meter. His style can be described as liquid, but he also does some very punctuated lines. His phrasing is elequent and the choices of melody that he pursues is natural. If you appreciate trumpet playing, get this."
3,"Unrivalled performance, but better in stereo","Because this opera was recorded in both stereo and mono, over the years there has been some controversy over which version is better. Since it was newly remastered and repackaged in 1996, the stereo version has come out the clear winner. The sound is just better. Be aware this one is the mono version, and though the performance is wonderful, you can acquire the stereo version for the same price."
4,Pretty bracelet,Very pretty bracelet - casual or dressy. I am hoping after some where and tear it looks as good as it does when I took it out of the box today. I was getting this fine magnetic jewelry this is a much better deal and just as cute.
2,Weak Clasp,I loved this bracelet but found that clasp came undone easily. If fell off my wrist from time to time and finally was lost last week. I won't buy this style again.
3,A very different bridge book that is entertaining & helpful,"All the play that isn't in the math is in this book. Zia Mahmoud explores nuances of the table that include mannerisms, partnership rites and reading character. He also tells amusing personal stories and has good gossip about some well known players."
4,pure passion,uplifting i was going therw some problems when i heard im free made a big dent in my heart love that song forever jon secdna keep writeing great songs youre outstanding
5,Excellent,The product came faster than I expected. It was in excellent shape. Veryhappy with service!
2,Another agony singer,"I don't get it. I just don't get all the glowing reviews for this album. To me he just sounds like a latin Michael Bolton...his vocals are strangulated. He sounds like he's in agony all the time...and the songs are nothing exceptional. I'm sure he has a good voice, the parts where he sings softer, shows that, but why does he have to strain his voice to such an extent that I'm sure he must burst a few blood vessels. I hope he never does a duet with Michael Bolton...that would be torture."
3,Pure Passion!,His music has so much passion! This guy can really sing! He puts all of his feelings into his music. Jon has such clear vocals and such a wide range! His music just makes you feel so good!
5,Jon Secada - The Unforgettable Musical Genius,"I was watching the Grammys in 1992 when Jon Secada was among the nominees for Best New Artist...and there was no doubt in my mind, heart, soul that he was. So, I'm just another one of those gals who don't get it. Because he didn't win, and if my life depended on it - I wouldn't remember who did. No matter. This Audio CD is one of the greatest musical masterpieces. Every once in long while a truly grand voice meshes so exquisitely with the music - that it resounds in your core with inspiration, courage, honor, dignity and profound love. Yes, music - great music - can do this. I am so happy that I never did sell my CD. But then, I believe if anybody wants to know the true value of art like this, you gotta listen to it with everything you have."
4,Good item,No surprises here what you see is what you get. Good addition to my seahawks bathroom. Best deal on the internet was right here! GO SEAHAWKS!!
4,Interesting concept in a contemporary thriller.,The good guys win in this one without undue blood and gore. Jack Jones captures the poignant interaction between a widower and his young-but-wise-beyond-her-years granddaughter. Makes you feel good about life again.
2,A little disappointing,The dried sorrel looks OK but I didn't know how small the packages would be. The product was only a few ounces for a LOT of money. I would not recommend this product.
4,Dried Sorrel,I loved this! The flavor was great and the drink was really easy to make. The only thing I didn't like was the price.
4,"Author interview on Diane Rehm show, 2/4/2005","The Author was interviewed on the Diane Rehm show, 2/4/2005.Sounds very practical and with good ideas.http://www.wamu.org/programs/dr/05/02/04.php"
3,"The coverage was light indeed. Really, it was ...","The coverage was light indeed. Really, it was too light. Also, it didn't feel as moisturizing as other similar products I've used."
1,Not very pleasing,This lyre would not fit around my clarinet nor my friends' clarinets! Not recommendable! Looks as described but just not suitable for a clarinet.
2,Broken,"For some reason, when this lyre came, the screw of the ring was broken, so it was impossible to get the lyre to stay on the clarinet. Otherwise, the actual clip of the lyre was fine."
5,Great information - a must read,I sent this book to a friend who has family members in the Jehovah's Witnesses. She said it is very real to life and appreciated me sending it to her. It really opened my eyes and makes me wonder how such a group can function in the USA. I guess I'm pretty naive.
2,Not the best way to drain your oil,"Sediment and metal particles settle in the bottom of your drain pan and these kits can't siphon all that out. Most ""quickie-lube"" stations that pioneered this process have abandoned it because they were getting sued for damaging the engine.The right way to change your oil is to run your engine until hot and and drain from the bottom; that does a much better job of removing the sludge."
2,no way,"gimmick.There are a number of rerouting oil change kits available. Why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail? The oil filter seals itself very well on most engines. While it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles, I wouldn't risk hose failure for a little convenience. On my Toyota truck I discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter. I'm not sure that many people even change their own oil. It's cheaper to take it to the Toyota dealer, 29.95 and they even rotate the tires."
2,B.S.,"I work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke.... with the money that you pay for a filter and 5+ qts. of oil, you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up. Will this company stand by its product like that? I doubt it... For a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you're worried about gunk... It's a scam..."
5,great,thanks to this kit I'll never get under my p/u again to change oil - takes me 10min tops to do so now. highly recommend this!
4,collection= versatility and uniqueness,"I am studying to become a writer and would prefer to remain in the alternative media, thus, I thought reading this book would help me to understand the topics and style of alternative writing. I did enjoy this book for the most part. There are articles that I think I wouldn't have read if they were in the paper, yet there were some that blew me away. For example, a survivor of child-molestation confronts his molester in adult hood. It's an intense and brave piece. However, it is a collection so it is presumable that the variety chosen by the editors was to attract as many readers as possible, therefore some articles were of little interest to me. Overall a pleasant read and would/will recommend to my fellow wannabe-writers..."
4,"Good Detail on Antarctica, With Detail on the Conditions of Exploring This Frozen Continent","This DVD introduces the reader to the extent of the ice cover of Antarctica. It also features the challenges of being stationed there. Project ANDRILL is discussed, and there are scenes that show the drilling through the icecap, then going through water, and then drilling into the sediment. This allows scientists to infer Antarctica's past climate.One caution: This DVD overstates the possibility that the global warming could melt the Antarctic icecap. There is evidence that the icecap is actually very stable. In addition, the scene of New York being partly drowned from a sea-level rise is misleading. A climatic feedback loop could develop that would increase snowfall falling in the ice-covered regions on Earth, thereby canceling the sea-level rise caused by melting ice elsewhere."
4,I use this book as a reference,I just started with chickens in my yard. Lots of good advice in this book. Get the physical book not the kindle because you will want to refer back to it. I taught my helper to sex chickens with just the pictures in this book and he hasn't been wrong yet!
5,Ichi... Reboot of Zatoichi,"I have seen previews of this movie before so I knew a little of what to expect. This is a classic reboot of the famous blind swordsmen, but the writers did a fantastic job of converting to a blind woman. Details are excellent and her sword moves are clean. Acting is excellent and the action is fast brutal and final. This is indeed a great retelling of the classic line and would love to see more."
2,A weak rehash,"I thought I was going to be all for an attractive girl to step up to refresh the Zatoichi franchise and then I saw this. The lead actress was a super weak representation of the series super bad sword slinger. The action is weak, the direction is weak and the story is boring with a slow pace that did not hold my interest no matter how cute I thought the lead actress was, while watching this I found myself continuing to get up and do other things and I am a huge fan of this genre and have been for years. I was extremely disappointed."
3,nice!,"Good history, although very predictable ,What can we expect from a remade movie .The original ICHI was definable much better."
4,"Ichi, I loved it","yesssssssss,the movie was great, good old samari stuffummmmm, whatever you do, dont listen to the english dub, lol you will flashback into the 60's lololpicture was excellent, the score was awesome too"
2,"It's all right. Watch ""Jin"" if you can.","This movie is just so-so. The actors perform really well but the story is just not that interesting.If you can, please watch a TV drama called Jin. Osawa Takao and Ayase Haruta are the lead actors. Unfortunately, the drama is not released in the US and has no English subtitle."
3,words have meanings,"Zatoichi is not a samurai, he is a yakuza!! samurai is a word for the noble class in the old japanese class system people had to be born into it.ceturies earlier during the sengoku(warring period) anyone could grab a sword and claim to be a samurai as Toshiro Mifune's charecter did in the Seven Samurai but by Zatoichi's time you couldn't get away with that"
2,should never being dubbed,"I didn't realize that this this is the dubbed version (my mistake). The film is great, but the English dub destroyed the film!"
3,Eh,"While most of the material in this book is available elsewhere, it's always much nicer to have it in a hardbound book. I think that the most important aspect of this book is not its contents in and of themselves. Rather, I think this book is useful because it inspires those who are new to the game to realize that the rules can be tweaked to suit their own worlds or play styles. Any seasoned veteran DM and his crew of players have their own rules as well as their preference for variants. I think this book is a good medium for conveying that aspect of play to new gamers. That being said, I never would have bought this book at full cost. It's not worth it. I got it here on Amazon in the used section (it was new) for 9 buck, which isn't bad at all."
1,Complete Waste,"The only thing that I found interesting in the book is the list of phobias in the end. Otherwise, it is just a set of useless variant rules. The book is also very chaotic, seemingly with no specific purpose. Any GM who would need this book is in a lot of trouble to begin with, if s/he can't use the DMG guidelines to come up with his/her own subtypes and variant classes."
3,I was hoping for more.,"There were some interesting things in this book.Character Races as a class, Hit Point / Restoration Point option, Legendary Weapons to name a few but, the book was rather skimpy when you consider the MRP was $34.95.Not a must have (especially considering the price) but, the book itself does have some interesting rule variants to add some more options to players and DM's alike."
2,"Boring, rambles on.","The first few pages of the book were interesting. I was hoping it would be a more detailed account of life before and after the reunification. Instead the author just rambles on and on, without really saying much of anything. Not worth the $10 (kindle edition)"
1,After The Wall,The book is written as an extended essay. There is very little observation of actual events. The author's account of life in the GDR lacks realism and is really quite shallow.
4,Materialism at its worst,"After the Wall depicts the real life impact of West German materialism on the people of the GDR. The younger generations adapted but as a consequence they lost their historical identities. The older generations of the GDR were simply overwhelmed. Although the intense focus on 'things' makes the reading a little repetitive and annoying at times, that just reinforces the fact that western/capitalist materialism is such a powerful force. This book offers unique insights into life in the GDR, capitalism, socialism, identity, and history. It's worth a read."
3,Lost in Translation?,"This memoir was on the bestseller list in Germany for over a year and sold a huge number of copies. Based on this information, I can't help thinking that much of what made this book such a bestseller in Germany was lost in translation. The English version is dull, repetitive, and written very simply as if a young girl was writing it, not a reporter looking back on her childhood. It is filled with many interesting tales I had never heard about East Germany but I would not recommend this particular memoir due to the sheer repetition and dullness of this translation."
5,"Originally written in the 40s, still relevent today.","This is one of those timless books that remain relevent year after year. Originally written in the 40's it remains one of the best commentairies on the American educational system. Absolutely required reading for anyone interested in how are children are taught, or not. This book along with Leon Bostein's recent book ""Jeffersons Children"" could serve as guidebooks for improving the quality of instruction in todays schools. Both these authors are quite clear about one thing and that is intstruction and/or teaching are one thing, and that education and ""educators"" are another. Both of them favor the elimination of the Education Departments from colleges and universities. These are both well written books, from two articulate intellects without an agenda other than the quality of instruction in todays schools."
5,power!!!!,"Poulan Pro 400E Ideal for felling small trees, cutting firewood and light cleanup A chainsaw that every household must have for day to day use. You gonna save a lot of bucks . Overall, this is a reasonably fast saw with good vibration isolation at the handles.Two thumbs up"
5,"Great Saw, Great Deal, Best Buy from Consumer Reports","Saw is for my husband, two of his brothers have chainsaws. One gas Sithe 14"", other is electric. They both were blown away by this saw, how well and easy it works. Dynamite product and price. Hubby is very happy."
5,Great for $90...,"For $90, it's an amazing deal. Really it is.But it's still a crappy underpowered saw. No really, it's not that powerful. I've used 4hp gas chain saws, this thing doesn't come anywhere near that kind of power. But then again a good 4hp gas saw costs FIVE times as much so really can't complain.With that said, it's not 4hp, it won't cut fallen trees nearly as well as you may hope. It will go through enough oil in a cutting session that you'll buy it in gallons. It's poorly balanced, feels flimsy and is loud enough to require ear plugs.But hey, you can buy 5 of these for the price of a saw that would be noticeably better."
1,Cheaply Made Saw,"The product arrived either broken or immediately broke.The bar adjusting pin, part # 530053068, is as flimsy as could have been produced.It only costs $.40 to replace, but with shipping it's over $6!I would never buy anything in this brand again and recommend that no one else does either."
1,electric chain saw,"I ordered this chain saw based on the description that stated it could be used with up to a 100 foot extension cord. 75 feet from my house is a heavily wooded area that I'm trying to clear of downed trees. As a female, the thoughts of electric vs. gas just seemed safer. I unpacked this wonderful piece of equipment anxious to clean up my property. As I read through the owners manual, I came to the page that stated that a cord greater than 50 feet is not recommended. Well, that wasn't going to do me any good! I returned the saw and purchased a gas model in it's place. I received a very prompt refund from Amazon. The reviews on the electric saw were outstanding which is why I had chosen this particular model. As long as you don't need to go beyond 50 feet, I think it would be a great deal."
2,Stopped Working After One Use,This product stopped working after one use and it was too late to return it to Amazon. I contacted a dealer who said they might be able to fix it but they are not located near me.
1,Gave up after first 5 minutes,"This product works fine for the very first 5 minutes, and then black smoke coming out of the motor compartment vent. After that, it quits, and nothing happens when you press the trigger. I saw other customers having the same encounter with this product. Seems like it's got a quality control problem at the factory."
5,Awesome!,I have 20+ foot Areca palms in my yard and I occasionally need to cut some down. This electric chain saw is Awesome! It cut through those palms like butter and because it's electric it's so convenient. It has so much power and for the price (plus free shipping) it can't be beat! Thank you Poulan and Amazon.
5,Exceeds Expectations,"We bought this to cut up some logs into firewood. The Forest Service is doing a lot of thinning in our area, we hauled a few pickup truck loads of these 4 to 6 foot logs back to yard but needed a saw to cut them up. After reading a few positive reviews we decided to order one. It is the perfect tool for this job. This saw cuts through 12"" to 14"" diameter juniper with ease. We had the logs cut down to size in just a couple hours. We a very happy with the Poulan Pro 400E."
5,Lady loves the saw!,"I live on an acreage & cut wood for heating. Love to use this saw up near the house for the final cutting of logs. I use a 100 ft heavy-guage cord with it. It is light weight & easy to use. I'm a 5-ft.tall 105 lb. 60-yr-old woman & have no trouble using this saw. It is also very easy to service--tightening the chain, adding oil, cleaning, etc. The 18 in. arm handles most trees. The motor is powerful enough to do the job."
1,Oil Pump Failed after a few hours use,"With all the great reviews, I bought this saw from Amazon. Worked great for a while until the oil pump quit pumping. This saw was never run low on oil and the oil was always fresh and clean. I disassembled the saw, everything was clean from the oil tank to the pump to the chain bar. I removed the oil pump, and it had clearly failed. Inside the housing I was suprised to find that the ring gear, which reduces motor speed, was not metal but a light tan nylon like material. My previous electric saw worked for over 20 years and cut a LOT of wood. I was disappointed at this early failure. I do not recomment taking your saw apart unless you know how to put it back together. Springs easily fly, and re-assembly is a bit of a trick."
1,Died upon first Use,"This Poulan died upon first use. Something happened to the motor, and there was black smoke residue on the motor vents. Pulling the trigger - it would occasionally arc, so I know it had power. Amazon let us return it, but charged a restocking fee, since we were busy and not able to send it back within 30 days. Disappointing experience. Spend the extra money and buy the Makita 16"". We did. The Makita is much sturdier - no comparison. Makita's direct drive motor provides a very solid feel."
5,Better than advertised,I looked at the 24 inch stump and wasn't sure if the saw could handle it. I hoped it would but without destroying the saw in the process. I was amazed! It ripped through the stump and was looking for more. I am very happy with my investment!
5,Perfect for what I needed,Cut through all the trees I needed without a problem. No gas engine to gum-up since I won't use it for another year.
5,ELECTRIC CHAIN SAW,"PACKED VERY GOOD.I GUESS WOULD WORK FINE. IT CERTAINLY IS MORE POWERFUL AND BURNS MORE AMPS THAN MY OLD 12"" ONE. BUT, I WANTED SOMETHING LIGHTER, SO WILL BE SENDING BACK.."
5,A great chainsaw at a nice price.,"We had a freak snowstorm that hit early in the season before the leaves were off the trees resulting in many downed limbs. One limb was 40' in length in our front yard, perhaps 8"" in diameter. This chainsaw did a fine job of cutting these limbs up. It is my first chainsaw and I am impressed with how easy it is to operate."
1,D.O.A - Not impressed so far!,"Just went to use my saw for the first time, and it was dead on arrival. Does absolutely nothing.Very disappointing given that I ordered it specifically to do a couple of small projects over the labor day weekend :(We will see how quickly Amazon gets me a replacement and if its any better."
5,Works Great!,"I received my new Poulan Pro 400E a few days ago and wasn't sure what to expect. Had a landscaping project involving cutting old telephone pole logs into 3 feet sections. The first saw I used was a gas powered one and the chain on it got dull fast. My wife was headed out to the site and she brought the new chainsaw just in time for me to test it out. And man did that 400E do the job! It was like cutting through butter! I was skeptical before about electric chainsaws, NOT ANY MORE! This has to be the quietest, easiest to use and clean chainsaw I have ever owned! I don't have to worry about getting out the old gas container to get gas or about the gas/oil mix going bad. Just add the oil and check chain tension and its ready to roll! Great saw, I can't stop telling everyone about it!"
5,Great saw for the price,"I bought this saw after reading the review on Amazon. I also checked the reviews of the electric saws I found at Lowe's and Home Depot. When I ordered this saw from Amazon, I got free shipping and it arrived in less than a week. I used it to take down and saw into manageable pieces, a tree about 18"" diameter. No Problem. The auto oiling feature is nice also."
5,Great little chainsaw,"This was intended to be a Christmas gift for my husband, but he happened to be home when it arrived, and he snatched it up. He won't have a big gift to open on Christmas, but he's so thrilled with it, it doesn't matter. We have a mountain property with a ton of dead trees, and he has a field day slicing those trees into firewood. He loves it because it cuts so effortlessly. I love it because it's quiet. It is electric, so it's limited by the length of your extension cord, but with a small generator, it can venture far into the woods. For the size and the price, it's a great chainsaw!"
4,CHAIN SAW,I ORDERED THIS CHAIN SAW THROUGH AMAZON AND IT CAME RIGHT AWAY BY UPS. THE SAW WAS READY TO GO JUST HAD TO ADD CHAIN-BAR OIL AND PLUG IT IN. I SAWED UP SOME OAK TREE LIMBS IN SHORT ORDER. THE SAW WORKS JUST GREAT.
1,Worked once then died,Very easy to start. Just added bar oil. Cut fairly effortlessly one weekend then didn't start at all the next. Not even a sound. Hopefully.just a dud and not a more common issue.Good return policy by Amazon though.
1,Motor burned out after 2 small trees,"I was cutting through a 12 inch cedar tree, when the chainsaw motor went up in smoke. I had only used it once before on a plum tree that had fallen in high winds. I called Poulan Pro customer service and they were rude and not willing to assist with recommendations for a chainsaw that could cut small trees (it was out of warranty). I also went to their website for help and no one has written back. Very disappointed in their customer service and their product."
5,"big job, big saw","I had one very large dead tree on my 5 acre property when I bought it. Not wanting this tree to come down on anyone, I used a 14"" electric saw to start out, but it quit working under the load. The 18"" Poulan from Amazon not only cut the tree down, but kept working all the way from bottom to top and is still working after replacing the chain with another purchase from Amazon. She runs fine on a small generator when I'm not near the house to get power. Great machine."
4,Poulan Pro 18-inch Electric,"This unit performed pretty much as expected, cutting through logs up to 18 inches in diameter with relative ease. I even used the saw to cut a hollowed dead Maple tree into sections before carting it away.If one were to express any reservation about the saw it would be with regard to electricity consumption. I suspect --but cannot quantify -- that the unit consumes a good deal more energy in terms of dollar-per-hour-of-use than a comparable gas model, as evidenced by a substantial increase in the subsequent electricity bill. Any references that could confirm or refute this would be welcome."
2,Cut well for few hours and then died,"I wanted to acquire an affordable saw for a one time only job. I selected Poulan based on the reviews. I should have read the low ratings one more carefully. I was not able to re-start the saw after the first few hours. I observed a smoke coming out of the motor on the last cut. So, I guess the motor probably died. And it was not even a large branch."
1,Too safe for a chainsaw,"I used this a couple of times in the few months that I had it: the chain needed frequent re-tightening, but I believe this is normal, and it did settle down by the end of the second, mild, log-cutting session. The next time I came to use it, however, the safety handle would not disengage the brake, so the saw would not switch on at all. So it became the safest chainsaw I have ever used. The brake release had been a problem for a couple of minutes when I used it the first and second times, but it had finally relented and allowed me to switch the saw on. Not this time, however! I got someone in customer service who was very helpful, and I am being sent a new one. But why would the same thing not happen again? Why make rubbishy products, using up raw materials, time and labor which could have gone into a good, useful product? This was not made in China, but 'Assembled in America.'"
1,Piece of Junk,"What a piece of junk. It made two cuts and then quick. Dead in the ""water"". Won't run. Won't do anything. Owner's manual suggests this could be a problem with the power switch (it does feel like the switch is broken) - so apparently this is a common problem.Had to get out my ""toy"" 16 inch Homelite chain saw to get some work done, and the Homelite works just fine, except the cutting bar is too short.Poulan? Junk!Hey Amazon, how do I get my money back?"
3,Box had been opened - a previously returned item,"The item had been opened and resealed, I assume it was previously sold and returned. Chainsaw itself was clean and almost certainly had not been used or else it was cleaned up exceptionally well, but internal packaging was incorrect, manual was slightly damaged and it was not possible to tell for sure if anything was missing (for example, there was no parts manual. There was no listing of ""What's Included"" so there was no way to tell for sure if some contents had been pilfered or lost. Seller did not note that his items might be previously opened and returned."
4,Good service from Amazon.,Very good product for around the house.Actulally I had a bad one!Amazon send me a replacement within couple days.Very please with the product and the customer service from Amazon
5,Good chainsaw,"I have cut up a ton of trees without any problems, so far. Will let you know more when I cut down 3 16"" tree's."
2,"OK, but wimpy","First of all, Amazon shipped this with the worst packaging ever. They slapped a sticker on the manufacturers box and sent it off. The package was all ripped up. I suspect that the bar may have been damaged because a butter knife cuts better than this hunk of junk. My little 14"" Remington beats the pants off this saw. If I replace the bar and chain I may get better results.Junk. Buy from a store, not from Amazon."
2,Lasted 6 months; replacement took two more,"My Poulan Pro 400E chain saw worked fine for 6 months under light use and then died. Nobody services electric chain saws - so Poulan ostensibly replaces the unit. Except that they don't actually send you one of the units they have available for sale to other customers. Your replacement unit goes on back order until such time as the factory makes another run.Poulan did send a replacement unit after about two months, and the replacement works so far."
5,Great saw,"I prefer electric chainsaws since they don't have nearly the noise and none of the stink of a gas-powered one, which I'll only use if I have to get farther than 100' from an outlet.I've been bucking wood this fall since I got the Poulan, and it's been trouble-free, operating just fine on a 100-foot cord on 14-16"" oak.I've read some reviews that suggest the saw might quit after a short bit of use, but I agree with one other reviewer who wrote that this is probably due to buyers who don't understand the chain lock mechanism. Make sure you check that before condeming the saw. I've also had to deal with a bad GFI breaking in my panel, which has nothing to do with the saw."
1,Not so good,I got about a half an hour out of the motor cutting some small pine trees into firewood. I think I got four wheelbarrows of cord wood before the brushes started throwing sparks and the motor slowing down. Then the GFI tripped and I was done. Sent it back for a refund.
1,Poor design,Poulan Pro 400E 18-Inch 4 HP Electric Chain SawReduction gear stripped after less than one hour of use.
3,Poulan Pro - the Achilles Heel,"Just received the unit - it was well packed, everything was in the box. Start cutting and the saw cuts like a champ - as others have said. However, after attempting to cut through a 16 inch pine tree the chain became loose. I tried to tighten the chain tensioning screw but it wouldn't do anything. I removed the cover as its too dangerous to run a loose chain. I found that the tension adjustment tang had broken. The tang is made from some cheap cast metal and is poorly engineered. Be alert this is a dangerous situation and Poulan should recall these devices, or provide steal replacement tangs, before someone gets hurt."
5,electric acts like a gas saw,"Although I haven't used it but maybe 2 or 3 run time hours, this electric saw works great. I have a gas 18 inch that is in shop so I bought this, being kind of leery of the capabilities of an electric but was pleasantly surprised by its aggressive cutting abilities even on fairly large limbs. I have had no problems with it so far.The only issue to get used to is make sure not to run out the oil tank, which uses 30W oil."
5,A GREAT little saw!,"This is a great little saw and a real value at the price.It's powerful enough for the typical yard cleanup jobs you run into, and it's clean and easy to use, since all you have to worry about is keeping the chain oil reservoir full. This is NOT a production-style saw that you can take into the woods and cut fire wood. It's a yard maintenance tool-- and a good one.This saw more than justifies the ""Best Buy"" rating Consumer Reports gave it. I'm very glad I bought it, and I'd do it again."
4,Chain saw for ice carving,Chain saw worked well for my ice carving but was a little noiser than I expected. I will know more about its performance as I do more carvings for outdoor exhibitions and demonstrations.
4,Electric vs. Gas Conversion,"I got fed up with my old gas chainsaw and decided most of my cutting would be done close enough to AC that I could live with an electric model. This Poulan saw has more power and is easier to use than my gas saw ever was, even new. The saw looks like it will be as durable but only time will tell. I started using it right after I got it and so far my impression is that I made the right decision to buy this model."
1,Worked good for a day,"This chainsaw worked fine for a day, handled all my around the house chores, the second day the started died on me, switched to a new brand and havent had any problems since, Will never buy Poulan again"
2,Works great if not Defective...,"Bought this about a year ago, I use it to cut small branches and a few small trees when I moved into my new house. after a few weeks of storage this saw start leaking oil the whole time... Ever since I've never use it again. Horrible build."
2,Worked Great - ONCE!,"I'm really frustrated with the product and Amazon (at first). I get the chainsaw and use it once in the first couple days ... no problems. In fact, I was pretty happy with the product. Then, four or five weeks later I get it out and attempt to use it again. Nothing! Nada! No worky! The thing doesn't even try. I'm thinking its got to be the cord or the outlet, something like that! But all is good there. Well, its under warranty and the manual says to just return it to the seller. Originally, Amazon would not take the return; I was not happy! But after a nice online chat, Amazon agreed to replace it. For that, I have upgraded my star rating from 1 to 2 in hopes that the next one will work more than once. I'll update after a few runs, and I've got a small tree to take down next. And finally, three cheers to Amazon for doing the right thing!"
2,"Worked great, until it didn't...","I purchased one of these about a week before Hurricane Gustav came through Baton Rouge, not even thinking about ever using it to clear off down trees. I thought it would be better to get an electric model and not have to fool with gas and oil. That was a mistake. After the rain stopped, I ended up carting a generator around in a wheelbarrow to use the chainsaw.When it had power, the chainsaw worked great. I could cut through just about anything a gas model would cut. The only problem with the generator was that the saw would trip the overload protection when cutting though large branches (over 10 or so inches).After about 3 or 4 hours of use, the unit just stopped working. I cleaned out the bar, thinking something had jammed it, but no. It was dead. It was a huge bummer to have it die while I was cleaning out the yard. I have returned it and purchased a gas model. If you live in storm prone areas, stay away from electric!!!"
5,"EASY TO USE, WORKS GREAT","The key to know is that you can run it with 100 ft of electric cord (proper heavy gauge as recommended). I checked with Sears (this is the same as a model they sell under a different name) and the wise old techy said 100 ft. not a problem.He was right.Just remember, in comparing cost to gas powered models, that 100 feet of extension cord will run $100 or more, if I remember correctly (shop around). I got two 50ft cords, makes it a little easier to deal with when I'm cutting closer to an outlet.Have used gas models in the past, and don't notice any difference in cutting power or speed between this electric and the gas models.Been using this for a couple of years. We're in the northeast, had many trees down from August 2011 hurricane, October 2011 ice storm, and now Sandy. This saw eats up everything, easy to use. Have also used it to take down some good sized trees. Doesn't seem to need any sharpening so far. Just cuts and cuts and cuts. Very happy customer!!!"
4,Satisfied,"Used to prune Oak tree, took half a day. Didn't even have to adjust the chain, which I would have had to do several times if I had used my gas saw."
5,A great machine!,"I bought this a year-and-a-half ago; and it's still going strong. Follow the directions carefully. It's so nice to find a piece of machinery made by a company who pays attention to safety, quality, and longevity of their product. This is a great chainsaw. It's not a toy. Be careful."
4,Love everything except for one little problem,"I got this saw after an ice-storm in Tulsa caused serious damage to a dozen trees. It had no problem cutting through a 16"" oak trunk.It's a workhorse that performs well. It tends to drink oil, but I guess that's good for performance and chain life.There's a gizmo that's a screwdriver/wrench for chain removal. I lost mine because THERE'S NOWHERE ON THE SAW HOUSING TO STASH IT (are you listening Poulan). Otherwise, chain adjustment and removal are pretty straightforward."
1,BROKEN OUT OF THE BOX - RETURNED,The chain tension adjustment screw nut split in half when I attempted to adjust the chain tension as part of the initial saw setup. This happened while I turned the adjustment screw with a screwdriver using only moderate pressure. Very disappointed. I returned the saw.
3,poulan chain saw review,"THIS SAW WORKED VERY WELL. CUT THREE TREES AND STILL GOING STRONG. MUCH LESS TROUBLE THAN GASCHAIN SAW--LESS NOISE AND EASY TO HANDLE....RECOMMENDED FOR OCCASIONAL CHAIN SAW USERS' NOGAS TO MIX AND STORE (A FIRE HAZARD) LESS MAINTENANCE, NO TUNE UPS, EASY START...."
3,chainsaw,Product descripton was helpful and accurate. The saw works very well with good instructions included.Poulan Pro 400E 18-Inch 4.0 HP Electric Chain Saw
3,Good at First,The saw worked pretty good out of the box--cut down a couple trees and large bushes. Got it out this spring (just after end of warranty) and it stopped oiling the bar and chain. This is not an easy fix and has to be done at a service center. I might as well throw it away and get a new one at the cost of repairs.
4,A skeptic on electric no more,"I have 5 acres and once or twice a year I'm working with a chain saw, went out a few weeks ago and after about an hour gave up on starting my gas chainsaw, after reading reviews on this item I decided to give it a try, keep in mind I'm in my late 40's and have used chainsaws my entire adult life. This saw has planty of power maybe not quite as much as a gas saw when your really pushing it but enough to handle any job you put it up to. Time will tell if this holds up but my instinct is that it will, seems as rugged as any of the 3 or 4 saws I've owned over the years (all Poulan); Have a 12 guage 100' extensionn cord and a generator for jobs beyond this. One piece of advice concerning electric motors is be sure you have a heavy enough guage cord for the distance, an electric motor of any type will burn up/fail if the cord is undersized for the amperage it needs."
5,Electric Beats Gas,"I was apprehensive at first. I did some light trimmimg at first. Then a 20"" pine fell in my yard. My Son brought over 2 gas chain saws and was having a difficult time cutting the pine. My electric Poulan cut it like butter. If you are trying to deside the pros & cons......It is worth the money!"
1,waste of money,"Purchased it 3 months ago, used twice for about 1/2 hour total to cut some 6"" diameter downed logs, light use. It wouldn't even start for me this weekend. Too late to return to Amazon, we'll see how good the customer service is at Poulan."
4,As Advertised,Very powerful and a solid piece of machinary. Only it needs to be cleaned often and the tension adjustment could be easier.
5,Great Deal on Poulan Chainsaw!,"This saw is perfect for my needs... 18"" blade with hefty motor for electric saw. I use it for cutting up downed limbs from old silver maple trees, and it works perfectly. The price was very good and the saw has worked great!"
1,Worked great cutting down 7 trees then motor quit.,"I bought it from Amazon.Had it for 3 months, cut down 7 medium trees and cut the logs up into firewood size. Then the motor went out.I live in San Angelo, TX and there is no service center here for Poulan's electric products.So, Poulan agreed to send me another one without me sending the old one back. I just had to peel all the stickers of it and send those in.Will see how the next one works out."
3,be careful,The oil pump is extremely cheap and poorly designed. Check it oftento ensure proper oiling of chain. They do not last long. The gears areof a nylon type material and will not hold up under moderate to heavy use.If all you need is light duty infrequent use it probably willserve you well.
2,This bluetooth card is not recommendable,"I bought this item from Amazon.com about 4 month ago. Driver is installed easily and works fine. But, speed of data transfer and mouse response is very SLOW!!! Transfer rate is under 1/4 than another USB bluetooth dongle, and I cannot enjoy games with bluetooth mouse because mouse cannot follow my action and is inaccurate. I think this is not recommendable for expert users."
1,Useless Garbage- do not buy,"Knife clunky but OK, sheath useless. Like another reviewer said, it comes with a few odd pieces that look like they can be used to attach the sheath to a belt, but the knife itself slips freely in and out of the sheath with no locking mechanism I can discover. Totally useless for diving."
3,Help mounting the holster,"There is no instruction, and I could not find out how to assemble it.There are 3 pieces, two small and a larger one, with screws but there are no holes with that diameter.I hope they help keep the knife locked on the holster, because the case keeps the knife loose inside the holster.I am assuming those pieces will help lock the knife.Any help is welcome. Thanks"
2,Kadena Reon a plus,"Kadena Reon horror movie: but, she is quickly dispatched in just one scene: all of her clothes still on, but minus a head at the end of the scene: I threw DVD away; Two Stars because it is, after all, another chance to view Kadena Reon. Those not obsessed by her might have stopped at one Star."
1,This stuff just doesn't work,"Pretty much every negative review sums it up. This stuff doesn't work.I've done it twice now and it's been a joke each time. The first time I figured I hadn't followed the instructions. A few years later, I used it on another car and followed the directions to a T. Still, nothing.Based on the hot and cold reviews at both sides of the spectrum, I'm going to venture that this stuff has ideal conditions for application, conditions that they don't share. Perhaps it needs to be 75 degrees out, partially sunny, etc.Don't waste your money."
4,Worked OK - but ... Proceed with caution,"Unlike most reviewers, this product actually worked ok for me.Like other reviewers, I found it to be cumbersome and time consuming.I'd call the results adequate but not up to pro standards. Maybe i could get a little better results the 2nd time around. Then again, it's a bit too easy to get substandard results.Overall I'm not sure I'd try it again. And I think anyone that's kind of harried (isn't that most of us?) should think twice before attempting.*** I did find their youtube video helpful (better than the instructions) - so if you try this product, give it a look.I also should mention that the 'included' push pin and alcohol wipe were not to be found in my kit. And you need to supply your own razor blade. For what you actually get (resin, syringe, doublestick tape, and a piece of flimsy plastic), the product is - in my opinion - kind of pricey."
1,Not worth even a fraction of the cost,"Knowing what is required to repair a windshield, I was skeptical, but I thought I would give Permatex windshield repair kit a try. Don't waste your money. Permatex makes excellent products, however this is not one of them. The seals blew out on both kits on a perfectly flat and clean windshield, spraying resin everywhere. Bulseyes are no better or worse."
1,This Product is Garbage; Save Your Money.,"Silly me, I paid a higher price at a local NAPA store so that I could repair a chipped windshield today. The product doesn't work, it made a mess, and now I don't have the product to return to get my money back. I think I'm more irritated at being ripped off by this company than I am at having a chipped windshield. This product is garbage, it doesn't work."
1,Disappointed in seller! What a Wanker!,"Read all the reviews and chose the permatex old style with the clear suction cup and what does this seller do he sends me a single use non clear suction cup. What a joke seller's like this just piss me off! What a wanker! Rip off! You are responsible for the listing and the delivery of the item in the listing not some other item donkey boy. Don't buy from J&aB tool sales, what a tool!"
1,It doesn't Work,"This kit does not work. The resin does not penetrate into cracks or nicks. The resin will come out of the sides and get all over the windshield. It seeps under the adhesive but doesn't go into the crack. There is insufficient resin- and it all winds up everywhere but inside of repair. I followed the instructions to the letter- this kit does not work. You can't get a seal over the repair with the tools provided and the resin does not penetrate into the damaged area, it all comes out the sides because there is no seal. In order for this to work, you would need to have a good seal over the ding or crack, and the materials in this kit do not provide that. You'd probably need to be able to open the crack as well- nothing in the kit allows you to do that. Don't buy this kit, I tried it twice, I followed the instructions, and have a pretty good understanding as to exactly why this product does not work."
1,It's a complete waste of time and money,"I used a similar product several years ago that I bought in the auto dept. of K-mart and it worked very very well. This stuff is not the same at all. For one thing, it never hardened, ran all down the glass, and certainly did not fix the ding in the windshield. I bought two of these and they both did the same thing.....believe me, I followed the directions to the letter.Don't waste a penny on this crap."
3,Worked Okay For Me,"A small stone hit my brand new vehicle's windshield, right in front of driver. It was fairly minor (about 1/8"") but annoying. I tried this product even though it did not get very good reviews here. I read the directions several times and even viewed the instructional video on YouTube to understand how it was suppose to work. It did okay. I can still see it, but it's an improvement. I'm probably the only person who will notice it now."
1,Not worth wasting money on....,"This was a waste of money, after reading and re-reading the instructions and thewn having my wife read and re-read the instructions we tried to implement the fix, we had the vehicle in a shaded area, followed the instruction sheet step-by-step, after the appropriate time we put the vehicle in the sunlight for the recommended timeframe and still it did not adequately fill the star in the windshield, I recommend that you just take it to the repair shop and let them repair it professionally...."
1,boring,I was looking for vampire movies and got this one. I wish I hadn't. Can't think of a thing that could redeem it.I will get rid of it.
5,Good pot for the price,"Shaft is a bit short (threaded part) for mounting, but works fine and is very cheap (1.98)."
4,A wonderful Tosca in time,"While the sound quality certainly isn't of the same wonderful digital standard of a CD recorded on todays state-of-the-art equipment, the opera itself is a magnificent, timeless Tosca. Maria Callas is a fabulous soprano that all who love opera must hear at least once. Tito Gobbi's performance is worth the price of admission in and of itself as well. A truly wonderful choice for the history and feel of a real La Scala production. However, those hoping for state-of-the-art perfect sound quality, for say a home theatre, may prefer a more recent, digital recording."
5,The best and most inspiring performance ever,"I am a Maria Callas fanatic and one of many millions of people who truly understand the voice of Callas. This 1953 recording has all the traits of what an excellent opera performance is. No other soprano has surpassed Maria Callas as Tosca. Of course, all the other singers had a great interpretation of the role. But when Maria Callas sang the role, she was Tosca. That's the jewel of this recording, she was Tosca. Not just a singer singing the role.To those who don't like Callas and always complaining about the shrillness, the shouting and ugly voice, which quite frankly is getting boring, ""Don't buy her recordings."" Simple as that. DON'T BUY HER RECORDINGS!..."
4,Ebben?,"Josh Rappaport, you are an idiot. I bet you have never listened to an opera in your life. This is not my favorite recording of the work (I like Freni better) but really.......let the hangover wear off before you write reviews, K?"
3,Recorded in mono,"Wonderful performance of Tosca, however I was quite disappointed when I realized it was recorded in mono.Mono definitely down-grades the experience for me...but that's just by personal preference."
1,Good alone Tito Gobbi and Victor De sabata,"Maria screamed at all times, no pianissimis. The best Tosca is with Renata Tebaldi and Mario Del Monaco."
5,Soaring Tosca,"This Tosca has been called a miracle and the greatest, most perfect operarecording every made. I absolutely agree. The cast is top notch, the conducting is great and the sound brilliant. Some bashers talk of audience-noise... They obviously never heard this as it was not recorded live but in the studio. The sound is fine. A Tosca every operalover must have!"
5,Callas is the better Tosca!,"Although I think Montserrat Caballé is the perfect singer for Puccini's operas, the exception is Tosca, which was undoubtely written for Callas. Her recordings with Gobbi are supreme - they're the best soprano and the best baritone of the 20th century! - and we have the impression they are singing in front of us.I'm 19 years old, and I realize that young people generally don't understand the greatness of Callas's voice: they say ""she didn't have technique."". I don't and I can't agree with them! Owner of a big voice - the modern sopranos can have an excellent technique, but thin voices (some beautiful, but thin) - Callas could sing a variety of roles that no soprano can anymore."
5,A MASTERPIECE-simply the best opera ever recorded,"One of the greatest opera ever is brought to life by the best Tosca and Scarpia ever : Maria Callas and Tito Gobbi. Callas is unsurpassed , the feeling and magnificence inspired in her role is breathtaking. Gobbi manages to live up to her ""divine"" standards and portays in genius the most fascinating evil charachter of opera. Simply a ""MUST"" for all opera lovers. I could write pages on this work but nothing i say can describe the feeling of listening to Maria and this opera. Di Stefano is also brilliant in his role and the singing of the great tenor arias in Tosca."
5,"This is the supreme ""Tosca""!!!","I want to clear up some things said by other reviewers.Callas does ABSOLUTELY NO screaming in this opera. She also DOES NOT overact. Her ""Vissi d'arte"" is truly one of the great versions of this exquisite aria available.Mono sound is just as listenable as stereo or digital sound. The noise in this opera is very minimal. There is no static. This recording is perfectly listenable.Tosca is a role for a spinto. Freni is not a spinto. She is a lyric, always has been. Caballé is a spinto and she makes beautiful sounds as Tosca, but her acting is ridiculous compared to Callas'.The person from New Mexico is a Sutherland sycophant who writes very negative reviews of Sills' and Callas' wonderful recordings. He/she also needs to seriously work on his/her English. You live in America, why don't you learn to write using proper grammar and correct spelling?"
3,Engineering Poor,"Musically this CD is first rate. Sonically, Callas should have married a first rate audio engineer like Schwarzkopf did. The CD lacks dynamic range, is pinched and is rather poor by good recording standards, even for the period, as is too much of Callas' stuff."
5,Inexcusible!,"The bad taste of the Italians. In a survey I've read, voted the greatest singers of the 20th Century. This is nuts.1) Jussi Bjoeling?????? what? He is a patch in the voice of Corelli2) Joan Sutherland, that's acceptable3) Rosa Ponselle4) Caruso5) Renata Tebaldi6) Mario Lanza7) Gigli8) Franco Corelli9) Mario Del Monaco10)Luciano Pavarotti11)Callas, what????????12)Amelita Galli-CurciI'll say the Italians have bad taste!"
4,Don't Buy This -- Buy the New Remastered set!,"A new (December 2003) Remastered edition of this definitive ""Tosca"" performance is now available here at Amazon, for $13.98! Buy that one instead of this one, which apparently has audio problems.True, the new remaster comes with no libretto, no cardboard box, and only a simple jewelcase to hold the 2 CDs. But it sounds great: I am listening to it right now and I can tell you it sounds terrific.Read the other reviews here to learn about the electrifying performances on this CD set. Then go buy the new improved and more affordable version! You see, sometimes you CAN have your cake and eat it too."
5,Very good but buy the REMASTERED Version!,"This Tosca is heavenly but it has been newly released in a REMASTERED version which sounds much better! Search for ""Callas Tosca"", it's the light brown jewel case. Costs less and sounds MUCH MUCH better!!! :-)"
2,19 year old opera buff,"I just bought this Tosca because of it's fame. I have another Tosca with Caballe and I like it much better than this one. The reason? Callas. I don't like her voice. and she reminds me of those silence movies where everyone is overacting. Also the sound is not good either. but I am still going to keep it because the tenor is excellent, and better than any tenors we have today. I think two stars is very generous."
1,A CALLAS FAILURE,I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THIS SET DOES NOT BRING TOSCA TO LIFE.CALLAS'S VOICE IS UNSTEADY AND ALL THE OTHERS(EXCEPT FROM DESABATA) ARE JUST IMMATURE.I BEILEVE THAT TOSCA IS REVEALED IN THE 1965 CALLAS'S RECORDING.IN THAT SET CALLAS SURPASSES HER SELF AND TITO GOBBI IS JUST... UNSURPASSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,BEST SYSTEM EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,MY SON IS 31/2 I GOT HIM THIS TOY TWO WEEK'S AGO AND HE PLAY'S WITH IT EVERDAY HE IS LEARNING HOW TO READ THIS TOY IS SO COOLLL!!!!MY SISTER'S SON'S BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP AND I'M GOING TO GET HIM ONENEXT WEEKTHANK'S ALOT FISHER PRICE
3,Not useful for games,"I disagree with the other reviews. I think the 'read to me' part of the system is great; however, the games are terrible. Not because of the content, but because the controls are extremly slow to respond. Half the time it does not acknowledge the correct answer, and says it is wrong, but we know we are selecting the correct answer. Maybe it is my DVD player, but I don't think so. I also wish the stories could be a little bit longer, or perhaps they could put multiple stories on a disk. Anyway the system is great for reading the stories to the children, but the games are lacking in functionality."
3,"Pretty good, but questions are too easy . . .","We got this toy for my daughter a few months ago. Overall, I think it's a pretty good toy. I LOVE that it has great classic stories instead of today's popular television characters. We got this for my daughter when she was 2 1/2 and she was able to use it by herself with no problem right away, so it is definitely user-friendly. I am hoping she'll eventually have more interest in this toy; she on rare occasion has asked to play with it, but not often at all. I also think that the questions that the child is asked are way too easy. If a 2 1/2 year old can play by herself and answer all these questions without getting any wrong, an older child must be bored - and this is supposed to be for kids 3-7!"
2,Don't bother...,"This was a huge disappointment. The questions are way too easy, my 3 year old gets bored within minutes. We own every book for this system and there don't seem to be any others coming out. She ran through all the books in one sitting and now there is nothing more to do. A 2 year old might like the repeating questions but a child that is past that stage will just be bored. It was a good idea...."
3,WHAT!,okay first off i like moral orel i have nothing against it and pretty much all the other adult swim shows are good except lucy the daughter of the devil metaloclaypse and the anime shows anyways why the heck do they put only one season of a show on why not have both!!! hello c'mon inleast itunes has season one finnaly but only 10 EPISODES!!!please
3,"An interesting story, but becomes a little tedious.","Much different from the average Fantasy Tale. It has allthe main components, but all characters are animals. Atfirst this twist was enough to keep it fresh enough toread on, but by 2/3rd through the book this premise worea bit thin and the faults of the storyline began to showthrough. Underneath the feline facade, the story is anaverage one, not really all that exciting or suprising,and definitely not one of the more interesting in thefantasy genre."
3,It was his first book...,"Tailchaser's Song was an okay book. Nothing exceptional, or poor, just okay. The characters were good, and the plot wasn't bad, but a few plot threads were loose and the ending didn't resolve everything that it was supposed to. Also, the cat culture is not so realistic as it might have been. Tad Williams is good, though. The Otherland series is REALLY well done. For a good fantasy about cats, try The Book of Night with Moon by Diane Duane."
4,Very Good Fantasy Tale,This charactors in this book could easily be subsituted for human charactors. If have read Tad Williams Memory Sorrow & Thorn series you will see a lot of similarities. Don't let the cats on the cover scare you away this is just a straight up fantasy story using cats instead of people.
5,Tailchaser's Song,The greatest cat story of all time! This book is for fantasy and cat lovers of all ages! Believe all the reviews in the front! I've read a zillion books in my 22 and a half years and this is my third favorite of all time.
3,Good but not Great,"I received Tailchasers Song as a gift because I love Tad Williams work, I put it on my wish list. While I am glad I read the book, you can tell this is his first work and the whole book is not as complex and riveting as a lot of his later work.The whole theme of cats and how that affects the story is cute. The cats have slightly different motivation than humans but it is still along the line is the typical human or humanoid groups that you would run into - the people who want security, those who want to live life wild and free, those who stick to their specific code of conduct etc. etc.I enjoyed the story, it was well done but I always got the feeling that I knew what was going to happen next, and it usually did. A good effort, there is nothing wrong with the story; it simply needs some more depth which comes through in later works."
4,Great read,"I really enjoyed this book. It's written in a way that makes a cat seem more of a different sort of intellectual being rather than a 4-legged human. The ending leaves me wondering if Tailchasers Song is really just the beginning of a series, which I really do hope since I found myself being really sympathetic for the protagonist and his friends."
5,Cat World!,"This is one of my all time favorite books. Tailchaser goes to nightmarish depths to rescue his lady love. The cats are realistically portrayed and the storyline is as good as ""Watership Down""."
2,Disappointing,"Tad Williams sets out to a great start, but after I was about half way through the book became stagnant and uninteresting. I like the idea of humans having evolved from cats (I love cats !!) and initially found the characters and their stories captivating. But Tad Williams just slows down and comes to a screeching halt somewhere near the middle, and I couldn't get myself to continue reading."
2,TAILCHASER'S INFERNO,"I love books. I love cats. I decided to read a book about cats. Tailchaser's Song. This was before I read Watership Down. But even then, I didn't find this book all that great. There are two parts that REALLY drag this book down. 1) the part where Fritty goes to that cat-mound-hell-underground place whatever. It reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Dante's Inferno. Too dark. Too depressing. Too boring. 2) The ending wa a BIG letdown. Fritty went all that way only to discover THIS! Sure it's a surprise ending, but it's the type of surprise ending that makes you sick. The way I felt after reading the last line in Orwell's 1984. Finally, let me ask you this: Which book sounds more interesting: Tailchaser's Song, where a male cat is trying to find his missing she-cat OR Watership Down, where some rabbits are trying to escape extinction both by man and their own kind. Read WATERSHIP DOWN by Richard Adams. THAT is a good animal-as-main-character book. This isn't."
1,couldn't finish the book,"This is one of the few books I was unable to finish. I love fantasy and cats, and this book was a disservice to both. Perhaps the story improved after the first sixty pages, but I wasn't willing to suffer through any more of the book to find out."
1,DRIBBLE,"This was written either with little old ladies or children in mind. CHILDISH. Like Cutsie Whootsie. Too much ridiculous detail and stupid talk and ignorant names for themselves, places and events. What a waste of paper.UNINTERESTING to say the least."
3,No Title,This book is a reprint of a 1917 naval text. As such it gives a good summary of seamanship 100 years ago. Probably not of much interest to most twenty-first century purchasers.
3,Music for a fast elevator.,"I've been listening to Larry Carlton off and on since he went solo. What is it about his style that just leaves me flat?The monotony of perfection? The man's playing is effortless. He switches between genre's with the greatest of ease.The relentless pop formula? He knows the book, wrote parts of it I suppose, and goes from AA to B like a greased pig.The squeaky clean production? So clean it makes me wonder if the studio itself was scrubbed down by hospital staff. Even when he's gritty he sparkles.Yet another blistering guitar run that somehow lacks life?This is a fast ride through the tried and true. Background music with a bit of a kick."
3,Uneven,"Larry Carlton is one the the greatest electric guitarists of all time. He has added spice to countless recordings, and has recently produced one of my favorite albums (Sapphire Blue). To me, his latest is frustrating, because it is a mix of a great track (Inkblot 11) and a few less stellar but worthwhile tracks (Double Criss, Naked Truth, The Prince) mixed with uninspired music. For the uninitiated, get Sapphire Blue first. For the fan, wait until this is released in the US."
3,"good, not great","If I could have given three and a half stars, I would; it's a little better than just ""good,"" but not much. To those who called this ""LC's best!"" I say, you need to listen to more. This is a lot better than the overproduced smooth-jazz dreck that Larry has produced a lot of in the past couple of decades, but it's still a little too smooth and too compositionally simple for my tastes. (Full disclosure: I'm kind of a jazzhead.)That said, there are several good tracks that feature energetic playing; it's better than his previous, overly sleepy CD, ""Sapphire Blue,"" and thank God, he doesn't sing on this one. I'd like to hear more jazz/funk from Larry, less middle-weight rock, and no more smooth jazz, please. (LC is best heard live, like on 1986's ""Last Nite."")"
2,Uneven,"Larry Carlton is one the the greatest electric guitarists of all time. He has added spice to countless recordings, and has recently produced one of my favorite albums (Sapphire Blue).

For the uninitiated, get Sapphire Blue first. For the fan, get a download of Inkblot 11 and save some money."
2,Where'd the LC sound go?,I'm a big LC fan from way back before he departed the Jazz Crusaders. The problem with this CD is we have lost the best LC has to offer while he tries to reduce complexity just for the sake of it. Being a guitarist myself I have a funny rule. Even though I have played for decades and I still play regularly IF I can listen to a CD and know from the first listen how to play the song and/or licks myself I think it sucks. The beauty of LC is that he usually has me well stumped. Just not this time. LC has a great collection of music. If you are new to him as an artist I suggest you start with his CD called On Solid Ground.
2,Burned wood,Had a few nicks in the tabletops and they stunk for a week like burned wood. Would not recommend anyone else buy I e if these tables. Also I got the first of my two tables that I ordered at the same time in around a week but did not receive the second one till around two weeks after the first one arrived and had to call their customer support to get that I e delivered because they messed up the order some how which was only two if the same item.
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST OPERAS SUNG BY CALLAS,"I think that Maria Callas is the best singer of all the times when she sings this opera. This opera is worth listening again and again, because there are so many things to talk about. The singing but also the acting (the acting by the voice, that is so important), the opera itself, the dramma which lives here, in this box. Open it, put the CDs in your CD recorder, and enjoy what I think is one of the masterpieces that Callas left to us. Wonderful!"
5,No laughing matter,"The name ""La Gioconda"" is a great irony, and this is a great performance throughout, peaking in the great heartfelt (but controlled) outburst of ""Suicidio!"" in the final act. Rosa Ponselle sang what is, in all probability, the OTHER very famous version. My vote is with La Callas, all the way. Listen to the ringing opening lines; the elegaic bel canto in the middle; the darkening down into the chest tones; the fatalistic closing lines, and the razor's edge to the diction (as usual) throughout. ""Suicidio!"" is a tremendous introduction to the art of Maria Callas: a distillation of her enormous power to instruct, to ""storytell"", and to amaze."
5,Wonderful entertainment,The Last Man In Town had me smiling all the way through. This is what a romance should be.
5,THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE?,"GREAT STORY -- Great story teller [author] --But Adultery????? HuH! takes all kinds!Loved the pic of Lucas [grin] can't really imagine it! And Priscilla, a very determined little lady who worked at living.Pic on back must have been the sister, Jeanette, the little scoundrel.Would like to hear more about Mick and does Jeanette ever really find Robert? Flora was some piece of work! It was so easy to get involved with all of these characters and that makes a great story.I Highly Recommend this book to all mature readers with an Excellent --M but don't look for this kind of guy in real life - he will break your heart."
2,Cutesy...,"I was really looking forward to this book, after hearing how highly recommended it was.Unfortunately, I made the mistake of thinking this was a 'serious' historical romance novel. Instead, what we get is a.... Adulterous hero, 'tortured' by being the only 'available' bachelor in town. And heroine, Priscilla, so prim and proper she came off as a caricature. This is really a book on the 'lighter side' of reading.While doubtless, this novel will appeal to some, I found the adulterous hero... Well, a bit on the icky side, and the prim heroine, while amusing, grated on my nerves. The dialog, as well, seemed too modern for an ""Historical"" novel.I would recommend this novel to those who are looking for a light humorous read. Readers looking for serious Historical should look elsewhere..."
5,"Entertaining, knowlegeable reading.","I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot in the process. Read at the right time in a person's life, it could cause them to become a geologist/volcanologist, etc."
1,Junk,This lamp is a piece of junk. I would have returned it to amazon but it was more trouble than it was worth. The lamp is not sturdy and attempting to put it together was a nightmare. This thing is cheap for a reason - beware.
1,not practical at all!,"I bought this for my husband, he couldn't use it because of its unpractical design..."
3,Not bad.,"I'm still using this wallet. My only complaint wish is that the credit card slots were facing in, so the cards could not fall out when the wallet is folded."
5,A Good and complete version,"Of course those who are familar with P&B will have their favorites among the recordings (I tend to be partial to the 1940-42 original cast recordings myself). But I like this for what it is. There are only a few others where you will hear versions of tunes from this folk opera that don't ordinarily appear on recordings (such as my beloved ""Somebody's knocking at the door"" and ""Jasbo Brown's Blues,"" etc.) But for what it's worth, this is an excellent long and complete version of P&B and I strongly recommend it for fans."
2,"Overrated, Overblown, Overdone","The cast is generally good, but this often-praised recording has some poorly-judged, overemphatic conducting from Rattle, including a truly ludicrous ""What You Want Wid Bess?"" And the sound is all wrong for this piece; it's balanced in such a way that the words are often muffled or even inaudible. So this simply doesn't do justice to Gershwin's unique masterpiece. Get the RCA recording (conducted by John DeMain, with Donnie Ray Albert and Clamma Dale), which is equally well sung but better conducted and recorded."
1,"This is a flat, soulless, by-the-numbers performance by all.","Having spent years listening to various interpretations of Porgy and Bess, this one really grated on my nerves. The greatest problem is a mechanical singing style and operatic diction so muffled that, even though I know the libretto by heart, I can't understand what they are saying. Who could imagine that Sporting Life could be portrayed so soullessly, or that cripple Porgy could sound so muscular. This is the 'Porgy de juer,' with three versions on the market. There are many other Porgy and Bess recordings. AVOID this one!"
4,good but long,"Book was well written and interesting and generally the plot and characters were good and interesting. However, by the end it did seem like it had gone on a bit long. There were lots of incidents and side stories that did support the general historical perspective and ""epic novel"" status, but did not support the plot all that much. By the end, particularly given the two_interleaved novels nature of the book, it made things start to drag a bit. That was reason I dropped one star."
4,mind blowing but difficult,"This book will reward your attention, but it's a wrist cracker and at times it's diffuse. Not for everyone, but fans will love it."
3,"Better than Quicksilver, but only half the book is good","It has taken me forever to finish this book. I was disappointed by Quicksilver, which I felt the book was far from. In The Confusion, which refers to the con-fusion of two books into one whole, I found the ""Juncto"" chapters, focusing on politics and court, economics, and the mathematically-inclined savants of yore, to be slow and tedious, filled with long-winded dialogs and expository letters. The ""Bonanza"" chapters, however, where a fun ride. Here we focus primarily on the King of the Vagabonds, Jack Shaftoe, as he goes from slave to pirate to merchant and finally to ""Leeroy""'s London connection. ""Bonanza"" is everything a good book should be. Sadly, only half of The Confusion is made of this great book-within-a-book, making The Confusion as muddied as the water of the Thames."
1,very disappoointed,"I've been a huge fan of Stephenson since I read ""Snow Crash"", and I really enjoyed both Cryptonomicon and Quicksilver.I'm not sure what went wrong, but ""The Confusion"" left me cold. The story lines and minor characters somehow were not as engaging.By the time I was half-way through the book, it was a chore. This is a book that I finished only because I had started.I don't believe that I'll bother with ""The System of the World."" Half-cocked Jack will have to muddle through without me."
2,One step above a history textbook,"I have journeyed through this Confusion for a month thinking I should be reading something else. The book is a piece of baroque in need of major editing. While there are a few imaginative places scattered throughout, it lacks prolonged life overall. If you thought Quicksilver was a wonderful book, then you will enjoy the Confusion, I suppose. If reading Quicksilver was as much fun as walking knee deep through parasite infested muck, you won't find the traveling in The Confusion any easier."
2,"Big, ambitious and disappointing","I am intriqued by thick books. That said this is, like the first in the proposed trilogy, terribly overwritten. Half as long and it would have been a much better reading experience. Stephenson digress to the point of becoming annoying. Much of these digressions are completely irrelevant. Part Sci-fi, part mystery, part historical - the author seemed unable to make up his mind and that ruined the experience. Bigger is just not better in this case, in fact it is to the detriment of the work. Better, more thorough editing is needed. Stephenson is trying too hard to impress with his ability to write, and write, and write - but the result is a lot of words, but not nearly enough substance. Plotting is all over the place, the characters are cardboard and pedestrian, and trying to pretend his characters are better prognosticators of future technological developments than Nostradamus is just too much to accept."
2,Let's get back to the good stuff,"I genuinely hope Neal Reads this......Look, it's simple, MORE SNOW CRASH.end of comments."
1,Could not get through it,"I'm sorry, I just couldn't stay awake reading this thing. It was confusing, boring, and annoying. I had high hopes when picking it up: I like historical fiction, I like reading about science and scientists, and I've generally found Irish writers (at least those available in the US) to be to my liking.Skip this one."
3,"brilliant performance, wasted on a cheap instrument...","The quality of the performance is FANTASTIC, nothing short of brilliant. I have two beefs with this disc though: first, Kirkpatrick chose to record on a clavichord, an instrument used in the baroque era for practice, due to it's inexpensiveness. It's basically just a really cheap-sounding harpsichord. If only this had been recorded on a piano or harpsichord...My other frustration is with the recording quality, but that's only because this was recorded 40 years ago--nothing can be done about that. But still, it should prevent you from purchasing this item. I would only buy this if you have another, better quality recording of the WTC, and are interested in how else it might be interpreted."
1,Can't Believe Someone Actually Financed This Release,"Music is a very subjective thing, and my fellow Arlingtonite liked this release, but I thought it was horrible. The editorial review mentions ""blues and soul"" and ""rock."" This cd has none of those, and I mean NONE. I love Vernon Reid and Living Colour, too, which is the only reason I took a chance on this release, and you wouldn't even know he is even on it. You can barely hear any guitar. If you like techno, then you may like this, if you like Vernon Reid, don't even bother. This is a complete waste of cd space."
4,A real reminder!,"This is the first Ann Rule book that I have read. I found many of the descriptive areas of the book disturbing, however, it is a good reminder that there are people who commit heineous crimes who freely roam our society in search of a victim. Very graphic and not a relaxing read, but one that reminds us that in the right time and place, we can be vulnerable to people like Randall Woodfield."
3,Chilling,"While I find in some of Ann Rule's book she tends too drag, I found this one to be too the point without going over board with gorey details. While the subject matter is disturbing, it is true life crime. Once again Rule shows great compassion for the police and the victims while accurately portraying the rapist/killer without being bias. While this book in some areas, such as a seen with two small children, is graphic, the message is still clear. The victims in this book did not plan on being victims, but were just ordinary women who ran into the wrong man. I think the book, while very chilling shows of the dangers that women face in society and that often times they become innocent victims of crimes. While this is not one of Rule's best work, it is worth reading."
2,C,"As I recall this book, the author jumps from one situation to another only to pick up the original situation."
2,"""Less is more""--or it would be in Rule's books","Rule's expertise; her experience; her knowledge and research about this book (the subject) and any book I've ever read by her seems almost flawless. She knows her subject and she has a splendid law enforcement background.She's also a gifted author.That should combine for the best true crime books in America. But it does not.THE PROBLEM: Rule's problem is flooding the readers with details that get in the way of the narrative; details that mean nothing; that makes her books so long one can become lost. I don't question the factual nature of these mundane, boring facts, for Rule is accurate; as far as I know no author is more factual.The book needs 60 pages edited out. Like all of her books, it is 20% too long because of the boring details.For readers of Rule, it would be wonderful if she decided that sometimes, less (really) is more."
4,Good Job of Suspence!,"Ann Rule does a good job here of keeping the suspence at a high leval well into the story. This is an improvement on the ""Stranger Beside Me"" where the public was partially familiar with the Ted Bundy story from news reports. It's also an improvement on ""Dead by Sunset"" which told the story of ""only"" one murder-with an obvious culprit. ""The I-5 Killer"" also features a truely sick and evil murderer-there is not the hint of good that Mr. Bundy may have had in him. The bad guy is really a bad guy. We feel for his victims and are glad when he is bought to justice. Readers who actually live along Interstate 5, especially in Oregon, should be especially interested."
4,One of her firsts.....,"This being an early Ann Rule book it lacks in some areas, including the meticulous detail that she is known for. While some did not like the event sequence of the book, I found it easy to follow. I especially liked the beginning of the book where Ms. Rule spends time getting to know Woodfield's ""girlfriends"". It made the murders all the more chilling.Not one of her best works, but good nonetheless. I'd recommend this to any true crime fan."
5,this is one of my favorite books,I have read this particular Ann Rule book several times and everytime I have found something new. Her books interest me very much that I sometimes stay up till 3 in the morning reading it. She writes the book so you can't put it down. Even my brother read this book and he doesn't like to read
5,An Excellent Recording,"Mozart's Horn Concertos are four of my favorite pieces of music, and this is by far my favorite recording of them. In fact, this recording was responsible for me learning to play the french horn. The tone is both crisp and light, with the mellow timbre of the horn maintained. Highly recommended!"
5,T-West is a musical gift!,"With this CD, T-West gives us all of the emotions and gutter soul that has been missing in R&B and Soul music since the digital revolution. She displays real talent in her vocals and in her writing that I haven't seen in a long time...if ever. I can't wait to hear more from her."
1,truley bad,I have read al lot of Johnstone's westerns. A truly liked all of them. I tried this one for a change of pace and I'm sorry I did.
3,"Has some great lyrics, but lacks the charm of other work","I previously had heard the Bassholes' first album, Blue Roots, before I picked up this one. I loved that album to death, but this album doesn't quite do it for me so much. First off, this is much more of a punk album that seeks to blow out your eardrums, more or less. Secondly, this studio recording lacks the warmth and DIY feel of the first album's 4-track sound. Finally, this disc lacks the memorable riffs of Blue Roots, except for the inferior new versions of ""Judge Harsh Blues"" and ""Nakema"" included. On the plus side, though, the lyrics are hilarious as always."
5,Has ample room for the libretto,"As you know, this is Klemperer's classic -- his only opera, and in this 1962 performance, a truly enduring one. It was the culmination of previous experiences with Fidelio at the Hungarian State Opera (1948) and Covent Garden (1961). In 1962, Christa Ludwig gave the performance of her career as Leonore.If you can afford to go more upscale for this classic Fidelio, the 1997 pressing from EMI, for the company's centennial anniversary, is the better choice. The earlier sets included the libretto, but tried to force it inside the jewel case, and a fair number of listeners wound up damaging theirs. For this pressing, EMI celebrated with a box set, leaving ample room for an 8-page essay and a 100-page, trilingual libretto."
5,mind blowing,"transcending the ego, is the state to which 'organized' religions preach, whether christian, jew, muslim, hindu, buddhist, shamin. this little book is so deep, with so few words, it is astounding. read this and the second half of Flatlander by Abbott."
4,Very informative & well thought out,"Written by the ""Father of the German Shepard Breed"", Mr Max von StephanitzProvides history of the GSD as well as many factors in choosing a dog for the great qualities they posess. I particularly liked the structure chapter and how it relates form to function."
1,"You're kidding, right?","My sister initially read this book by accident and needed someone to share in her horror and complete incredulity that something as puerile as this could possibly be published and distributed. Not only are the characters never developed, they are never true characters as they change with the flip of a page. The plot is a complete affront to anyone creative and the dialogue is an affront to anyone who has ever spoken a word. I actually used the word 'trainwreck' and I'm glad that my observation was shared by another reviewer. I don't generally like to give a bad review so think of this as more of a warning: Unless you want your pets/children/spouse to think you have completely lost your mind then don't read this book. You will continually close it and roll your eyes and speak out loud to yourself. It's that bad. In order to review it I was FORCED to give it at least one star. I would give it black clouds if allowed."
4,Pretty Freakin' Good,"Some parts i felt were a little long, and just dialog, but the ending was a shock and the majority of the writing was really good.There is also a movie that is pretty true to the story, so if you want an animated view, check it out as well."
2,A classic novel of the cold war and the limits we face.,"Although rather faint and shallow by todays techno-thriller standards, Fail-safe was for its day, THE story of the world on the edge of nuclear war.If you are into period literature, this is a good example of a best seller from the cold war crazy early sixties."
5,Spellbinding,"This is one of those books you can't put down. I read it back in 1973, saw the original movie )very faithful to the book) and the remake, all of which were excellent.This novel captures perfectly how something can go wrong with nuclear weapons. Even with all the built in safety features (so called 'fail-safes'), the missiles and bombers are controlled by flawed human beings. Several things make this book so terrifying - it is entirely believable, possible, and the consequences are utterly catastrophic. Aviation buffs will be enthralled by the B-58 Hustler bombers.This movie unfortunately was overshadowed by Dr. Strangelove which was more of a dark comedy.The Cold War is over, but the possibility of accidental nuclear war still exists. A classic, timeless novel. Author Eugene Burdick captures the imagination not just with a technological thriller, but blends the human emotions into the story perfectly."
3,Book : Fail-safe,"Started reading and is an easy read. The movie is supposed to be a good copy of the book, and hence the interest to read it"
3,"A harsh taste of an ""accedental reality""","This novle goes far beond the thrillers in today's movies. It makes you aware of how close the world is to an accedental distruction. Acording to Murphy's law this will happen, weather it's mechanical or human error we will suffer for our own creations."
3,"New York and Moscow are destroyed in this novel, Fail Safe.","In the novel Fail Safe, nuclear war destroys the cities of Moscow and New York. If you go to CalArts, take Digital Landscapes. I give the book 3 stars, but the class 5. Thank you."
4,The Definitive Cold War Thriller,"The arms race takes a turn for the worst as a nuclear strike is accidentally started. The fate of millions depends on the diplomacy of the highest echelons of government and the act of one man. It all seems like a bad movie plot now but thirty years ago, this was the fear in the hearts of all. I read this book in 1982 when the nuclear threat was still quite real but nowhere near as intense as it was during the early 60's. You'll finish reading this book wondering, ""Were we ever this close to the end of the world?"". The greatest horror stories are the ones that could actually happen. As dated as it is, Eugene Burdick still manages to take you on a wild ride to the Apocalypse."
2,"NO, NO , NO, NO!","As much as I respect Callas (and I've also mentioned this in some of my other reviews), she is not the ideal Puccinian soprano. She is really good in some Verdi operas but she's not the best choice for the Puccini ones. Especially in the famous aria ""Mi Chiamano Mimi"" she is REALLY AWFULL. She takes gasps all the time and does not perfectly finish a sentence (listen to ""e in cielo"").And it is a pity if you're going to buy La Boheme (one of my most beloved operas) and not have one of the best recordings (allthough here Di Stefano and Moffo are very good,thus the 2stars). My favourite recording is the one with Renata Tebaldi and Carlo Bergonzi but there are other ones also quite good (though not equally good to the Tebaldi set).Take my advice, don't choose for Callas as Mimi, YOU'LL BE SORRY!If you really want to FEEL PUCCINI (and we know that Puccini is all about feelings) buy the Tebaldi edition or another one!NOT CALLAS!"
5,Callas rules,"Okay I admit I'm a huge Callas fan, but this is a great set when you consider the performances of Di Stefano and Moffo. I particularly enjoy Moffo's playfulness in the role of Musetta. Although you wouldn't think this role would be right for Callas, she shows the extent of her genius in the subtle way she portrays Mimi. If you listen to her famous ""Tosca"", and then listen to this Mimi, it is hard to believe it is the same person singing except of course for her distinctive voice timbre. It is obvious she is completely immersed in the role, a tribute to her versatility."
1,My first online bad product purchase in years.,New Beautiful Tall Linen Cabinet With Glass Doors And Silver-Finish FixturesThis cabinet is actually two small cabinets sitting on top of each other. To insure that the top cabinet will not fall or tip over you have to insert 4 short dowels 2 on each side that causes the cabinet cabinet be VERY wobbly and unstable. The wood cheap solid wood that cracked when we screws the supplied hinges. There is also a very strong chemical odor from the paint they used the is actually noxious.Too bad my wife threw away the box other I'd have returned it back by now.Be careful if you ordered a tall cabinet and it comes in a 3' tall box.I've learned my lesson.
2,White bathroom cabinet,I was very disappointed with all of the hardware that came with the cabinet. None of the knobs worked. I Ended up having to go to a hardware store to get new knobs. The screws that hold the hinges were also striped or were not the right size. The doors do not hang correctly. I checked on line and on my receipt to see if there was a customer service phone number. I couldn't find one. I was very disapointed.
1,AWFUL QUALITY - STAY AWAY!!!,"Huge mistake. The ""wood"" is super cheap composite - like cardboard with a coating over it. It comes in so many little pieces I had to hire a handyman to assemble. The dowels do not hold the parts together, too short, not even with the extra screws my guy added -- it still sways when you touch it and I know when move someday it will fall apart. It was impossible to align the pieces properly. The back wall is several pieces of small cardboard-ish stuff (instead of one piece that would help with stability) which keep falling down. The supports for the shelves are extra short (extra cheap) so they keep falling out. The holes on the vertical sides are not aligned right so one of my shelves is slanted and there's nothing I can do. Some hardware was missing from the box so I had to buy extra. This is a ridiculous piece of junk with some good styling to lure you in. I see the price is down from the $300 I paid to $220-240. Doesn't matter. STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,Not white/chipped/doors don't match,"I returned this. First, it is not white. It is ivory or off-white which I was unable to tell from the picture. In several places there were nicks in it and the doors didn't really match up well. All in all it is not a very well made product."
1,Not White,"I ordered this cabinet for my bathroom. It arrived and when I opened the box I was shocked to discover the cabinet was gray in color, not a crisp white as in the pic. I figured well that is my fault for ordering online so I went to assemble it anyways (to much hassle to return), and discovered it is defective. One of the side pieces is missing a recessed nut. Now there is no way for me to get it together tonight and I have the pieces all over the bedroom. AGHH!! I guess I wll have to go to home depot tommorrow and try to find a replacement part since I can't wait for the company to send me one, not that there was any company contact info in the box. I thought I was saving some time and effort with the purchase, but I as wrong. Try a different cabinet."
5,Expensive but worth it.,"I was keeping a lookout for these at a clearance price and when it finally hit I picked them up. Man, I was not dissapointed. Very high quality, exactly what you'd expect from Arc. Lightweight, fast drying, and repels water nicely. So comfortable. Nice water resistant zips. Seems very durable.Only complaint I have is that the sizing is off. Every thing I read about the palisade was that they are trim fit so size up. Not the case. I am in between 30-32 waist so I went with the 32 and my size length 30. Length was good and with the nicely made built in belt so was the waist. But overall they are way more baggy than I expected. So if you're in between sizes I recommend to go smaller."
1,cut to ribbons,this was a great miniseries which was badly cut. At least 3 hours were cut from production. why bother putting out an edited production which is still left at 6 hours. If one is willing to invest 6 hours on show he is certainly hoping to see the whole uncut 9 hour production if you buy this you are nuts wait for the entire uncut program to come out this is garbage.
3,Sad reminders,"Sadly, this book wasn't really needed. So many of our historic treasures have been replaced with soulless glass boxes that to look through this book is to be reminded of all that we've lost. I only give it stars for the historic pictures. Call me old-fashioned or help me take off my rose-colored glasses, but Detroit has not worked to saved its history like Chicago and we suffer for it today."
4,What is Detroit?,This is a quaint little book with pictures of old detroit and photos of new detroit taken from same vantage points as the old photos. I can only love the once great city from afar. As for experiencing Detroit in book form I still prefer:Stalking Detroit
2,"The ""NOW"" is outdated",The Now pictures are somewhat dated when you consider how rapidly the city has declined in the last ten years. Several of the Now pictures show buildings that have been torn down (like Tiger Stadium). Some buildings are in a much poorer state then the book shows (like the old train station). The Then pictures are great and the write-ups are well done. I didn't like that some of the angles changed between the Then and Now sites....I would have preferred a shared angle.
5,Great Perspective,"I've enjoyed several history books about Detroit and seen pictures of how things looked 100 years ago, but I could never put these photos in current day context until I got this book. As you open this book you'll notice a historic photo on the left page and on the right you'll see the very same location but with the current day buildings in place. This is a ""must have"" book if you want to learn more about the history of Detroit. Impressive coffee table book too."
4,Detroits past,"Its a shame the city has let so many great structures and monuments go to waste. Detroit was a spectacular thriving city long ago. Great writing, interesing subject choices, but there were about 3 photos were the angel of the shot could of been much much better. Almost amatuerish. Should have included more interioir shots. The city wasn't always showed at it's best , I think due to the camera angles or simply waiting ff a better shot.IITs a super cool book to actually compare how things looked before and now. Worth buying!"
4,Hooked by Carol Shields,"Carol Shields hooked me in with Stone Diaries and I have subsequently enjoyed Happenstance, Larry's Party and a Celibate Season. I have just completed Dressing Up for the Carnival and am yet again amazed by Carol's ability to take the simplest things and see into them and beyond their common use. The story Mirrors is a typical example - we take them so much for granted and yet we do not look at them but ""into them"". Her language is rich, descriptive, insightful and makes me want to hear her voice. I love the glimpses she gives into married lives and the various swings and roundabouts of relationships, the distances between people and the tiny, meaningful, tender moments - Windows is a typical example. I am delighted to discover that I have many more of her books to enjoy and am now about to continue my research on Carol with the help of this site."
2,Hit and (mostly) miss.,"After the disappointment of Carol Shields' last book, the novel Larry's Party, I thought I would give her a second try with this collection of short stories. At times Shields doesn't disappoint - Dressing Up For The Carnival has a few wonderful stories - I particularly like 'Mirrors'. However, in many stories Shields tries to put an imaginative and poetic slant on the everyday banal - but sadly with little success. Most of the stories here seem forced, the result of some self-imposed writing excerise that in the end read like teenage creative writing exams. For such an accomplished writer many of these stories seem young and naive - even unfinished perhaps. Her themes of aging women, often disappointed by life or the infidelities of men, are bittersweet but in the end left me with nothing."
4,A splendid storyteller.,Dressing Up for the Carnival is a novel where the ordinary and typical become unusual and special in the hands of this splendid storyteller.
3,An O.K. sequel,"If you really love ""Click Clack Moo"" you will probably like this book. You must be familiar with the premise of ""Click Clack Moo,"" or this book will be very confusing. Even to the seasoned ""Click Clack"" reader, the plot is not very clear. My kids are not very interested in this book."
4,FUNNER THAN EVER,This book is the best book for kids every age. When I'm down and I just need to laugh I pick up this book and just read and laugh.-Alyson (...)
4,Wish I could give it 4.5 - a real charmer,"We started with Click, Clack, Moo but I like this book better. This one has the same warm and funny illustrations, the same wit, and it's not boring to read to your kids over and over and over again. The downside to CCM was its political/union overtones. The only downside to Giggle, Giggle, Quack is the ending kind of fizzles unlike the charming and unexpected ending in CCM."
4,"Good, but not as good as the original...","Click, Clack, Moo is a book that even grownups will find funny. Giggle, Giggle, Quack is a funny book in it's own right but doesn't quite meet the standard set by Click, Clack, Moo. The story is actually very clever but my four-year-old (who LOVES Click, Clack, Moo) didn't quite get it and the ending left us both a little cold. All in all, this is still an exceptionally good children's book when you look at all the garbage out there. Thanks for Cronin and Lewin for another great book!"
2,History Revised?,"Unfortunately for readers who were not alive at the height of detente, this book offers little explanation of the KGB's primary motive for engaging detente; the hope of exploiting intelligence collection opportunities against the U.S. and its allies. Numerous former KGB agents have revealed the Soviets true intent at the very beginning of detente. Subsequent efforts by U.S. agencies to end detente were born of a very serious threat to U.S. national security. Place the blame squarely where it belongs - in the lap of the KGB."
2,"Too Long, Too Loose","""The Executioner"" murders terrorists, saves kidnapped damsels from evil African dictators and wipes out a drug cartel in this completely hackneyed and predictable exercise in action genre writing (or typing). Some of these things can be crisply written and fun to read, but this thing, at about 370 pages, is at least 100, probably 200, pages too long.I love good pulp, but this is bad pulp. Try some Richard Stark to see how it's done: terse, brutal, intelligent."
5,Love It,"Powerful and passionate are the first two words that come to mind when I think about Kennedy's version of the Four Seasons. I absolutely love it. I listen to this CD on my ipod on every plane trip I take, often 2-4 times a month. I never tire of it. I have listened to this CD more times than any other CD I own, with the possible exception of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. Buy it."
2,it is ok,ok but 16.98? complete? there are a lot better versions that include an extra concert or two for much more reasonable prices.
1,Way too fast,"This has to be the absolute worst interpretation of ""The Four seasons"" I have ever heard. Kennedy just rushes through everything isntead of slowing to savor it; I get the sense of zooming through it. He plays way way way too fast for me to enjoy it at all, and while he says in the liner notesabout color and imagery, he plays way too fast for me to hear anything. Very disappointing."
5,Amazing,"No doubt, a masterpice like Kennedy's interpretation of ""The four Seasons"" is unique. I first had the chance to hear this a little after the CD was released several years ago and I was so trilled by the way Nigel Kennedy was able to add something of his own to a very conservative baroque work."
2,Not up to LP standards,"This book had a number of problems, including wrong address information for several sites, mislabeled maps, etc. The suggestions made were as per usual with LP guides, excellent, but when the map and direction goofs adding so much time in looking for things in the book or on the wrong streets, the advantages of having a pocket guideare quickly lost."
3,Woman is a phony,"This is a not a review of the book. I met this woman over 20 years ago, just about when she was looking to break into radio talk. She struck me as someone solely interested in making a name for herself, with the least interest in the people she was advising. It is sad to see, people like this whose careers are the all encompassing monsters in their lives. It's all about money and fame, and this lady wants them both. I could be wrong. Who knows."
2,"Great Work, Big Rip Off","I had to be negative, but I bought this book hoping it would have more information on H & M work than accessible on the net, but I was really disappointed in the quality and most importantly value for money considering it is only a paperback."
4,FERRY AND The High Pitch Reverb,"Ferry Corsten is one of the best DJ's on the planet. Definately in the top 10 and this album proves why.Look 4 stars is not bad, its just that similar to his creamfields release, he can be a 'tad' inconsistent.Ferry is a very flexibly minded DJ and producer. He likes too much music, and his style reflects that. For Purists looking for 'electronic trance' you may find yourself a little bit fustrated (at first)....but when you appreciate this album for what is it. You'll see love. You'll see Ferry. And above all, you'll see talent.Listen to Galaxia track 6 - this song is like a stream of consciousness. Why many of us fell in love with trance in the first place.-Stef"
3,Creatively Boring,"Ferry Corsten attempts to go above and beyond the current standard of electronica in this one, creating his own sound that may transpire into something fantastically innovative once it has been mastered. Until that point, however, we are stuck with a genre of music that is lacking its past luster. Im not one to criticize an artist who holds so much magnitude in the electronica world. Corsten is obviously going somewhere with this new sound, and his new sound is what will continue to push this tremendous genre of music. But when I hear the track Fire, and soon realize that it is the only track on the album I will listen to in full, that album soon is kicked out of my rotation. So is L.E.F. a waste of money? No. But will it be a famous album for years to come. Most likely not. I give this album a C. Creative, but boring."
5,The best,"I love this album, Ferry covers a wide range of different styles within electronic music, moving from downtempo to breakbeats, into progressive trance and bumping near-house. Favorites are ""L.E.F."", ""Fire"", and ""Forever"" on the uptempo side and ""Down on Love"" and ""Into the Dark"" for a little more laid back grooves."
4,Good? Yes. All new? No.,"Ok, I agree, Galaxia is a great song. One of my all time trance favorites. But it's not new... It's been around for SIX YEARS. (Originally made by Ferry under the alias Moonman)I appreciate the fact that now it's more widely available, but I would've rather bought a single with the original version and the rework.Without Galaxia, it would still be an ok album, (but just that) being held by ""Forever"", ""Are You Ready"", ""Fire"", and ""Junk""."
2,Calling 9-1-1 Sounds an Alarm On This Phone,"Whenever you call 9-1-1 on this phone, it sounds a really loud alarm. This ""feature"" can not be disabled.If you are calling because someone is breaking into your house, the alarm will announce to the thief where in the house you are hiding.Aside from that the phone is great. But the 9-1-1 alarm is a deal breaker for me."
2,Don't buy it!,I had this phone for about 3 days and the flash light froze. I had to take the battery off to fix this. Only for it to freeze again after trying the flashlight for yet a second time. It automatically deleted a couple of my contacts. I took it back & let Verizon replace it with the same model only for the second model to not recieve all of my text msges & text pics. When I used blue tooth or a regular headphone my callers were unable to hear me. The camera is aweful. I understand that this is a phone good for durability & the bells & whistles aren't suppose to be great but the basics should at least work. I exchanged it for the chocolate LG 8550. So far so good.
5,Elgar ... Cello Concerto + Sea Pictures.,"Incredible ... incredible. You get the classic 'Cello Concerto in E minor' of Elgar, with du Pré (cello) and Barbirolli conducting the London Symphony Orchestra + 'Sea Pictures,' (also Elgar, of course) with Dame Janet Baker as mezzo-soprano.While those two works are classics (certainly the concerto), they are also treated with utter care and respect by certainly one of the best conductors ever, and may I say legendary du Pré? and the superb Dame Janet Baker. Couldn't go wrong, you would almost say; and it didn't.And so EMI Classics has this wonderful CD to offer, at a most friendly price. I believe Penguin Guide showered it with rosettes, proof that you almost can't go wrong.As for the works under review, the concerto can be described most efficiently if I say it's 'sad'; and the song cycle Sea Pictures is just powerful."
4,Another thought,"Yes, DuPre and Barbirolli give a magical performance, but like all interpretations, they are not perfect. There are at least two other versions that have their moments, and are worth treasuring for those passages where they top DuPre and Barbirolli. Listen to the slow movement section of the old Pini recording ( circa 1951) and the last section of Ma's performance. Beauty indeed !Baker does well in the ""Pictures"" , but listen to the Gladys Ripley recording from the 1950's for an entirely different approach, where the voice takes on a more wistful, philosophical and nostalgic tone. She was probably more mature in years when the recording was made, and gave some passages a kind of Mahlerian Weldschmerz that served them well."
4,"Intense, evocative","Elgar's cello concerto is an intensely moving and evocative piece, played with incendiary passion by Du Pre. It is contemplative and elegaic without being melodramatic. A sublime and haunting piece. The one drawback to the CD is the pairing of Sea Pictures with the cello concerto. Although Sea Pictures is a pleasant song cycle with admirable work done by the soloist Janet Baker, it is ill-paired with the cello concerto. The gravity of that piece is somehow trivialized by it, even though it is a fine piece. I find myself skipping the latter in favor of the former. I think I would have preferred coupling it with another instrumental piece with more gravitas like Enigma Variations or something from Ralph Vaughn Williams. Nonetheless, it is still well worth owning."
3,So-so,"While I love Elgar's ""Cello Concerto"", and this is probably the best version around, one if I were to rate by itself I would most definitely give five stars, yet it isn't by itself is it? No, unfortunately it's been coupled with ""Sea Pictures"" which almost makes me shudder as its solo singer belts out horribly ""musical-like"" tunes one after the other. It absolutely made me cringe as it gave me unwanted flashbacks to ""The Sound of Music"". I truly am torn on my rating of this disc, but ultimately no matter how good the first half is the second half is porportionately as bad and therefore my three star rating."
5,Du Pre's reaches a level even Elgar cannot imagine.,"When I compare this performace with the others (YoYo Ma)and one that I heard in Europe, DuPre reaches a level above all. I hate to tell people that the standard has been set, but this one is it for Elgar's piece."
1,I Should Have Listened to the Reviews,"This was a christmas gift for my two kids. We've spent more time trying to fix it than they have been playing it. It's a nuisance. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. I read the negative reviews and bought it anyway. HUGE MISTAKE! What a waste of money. We got it working and while the kids are playing it, it stops working again. Fixing this game is not how I want to be spending my time. And the kids do like it and wait impatiently to play while we are trying to get it to work. Just buy the books and spend your time reading to them and asking fun questions."
2,good toy,"I gave this toy to my 4 1/2 year old daughter and was able to program the the controller for our family room and rec room dvd players in about 15 minutes, without any difficulty. I played with my daughter, who caught on very quickly. I think its a great tool for comprehension skills. I asked my daughter questions about the story the next day, and she remembered various story details, such as what color the beasts eyes were. I have since bought ""Miss Spiders Tea Party."" Note: I did give same toy to my nephew and his dad has had a hard time programming the controller."
2,Very disappointed,"The system was easy to set up and seemed to be working fine UNTIL my daughter needed to use the Page Forward button. In the Read On My Own option, she is unable to page forward and it stops the DVD which makes this feature useless. In the Read & Play mode, she is unable to advance past the first play section because the page forward button will not advance to the next section which makes this feature useless past the first play section. I did replace the batteries in the controller and the ""Test Your Controller"" confirmed that set up had been performed correctly. I called Fisher-Price consumer affairs and they are sending me a replacement controller free of charge. We'll see what the second time around brings. Overall, this has been a very disappointing gift for our daughter. Buyer beware."
3,"Good Idea, But definite problems","I am an English teacher with a 6 year old little boy so I jumped at this toy. My son loves books and reading as well as video games so I thought this would be a good combo. I read the reviews and was prepared to be frustrated by the set up process. However, like a few others, my setup would not work ...ever. I got all the buttons to work except the asterisk. I tried a different remote. Same problem. I finally figured out that the asterisk button is supposed to be the 2 button on the remote. So, I just let him play with controller and dvd, but whenever he has to press the asterisk button, I told him to press 2 on the remote control. Annoying when you paid for the thing to work, but hey, at least he can play."
5,Excellent toy!,My daughter received this system for her third birthday. She LOVES it! We play with it everyday.The set up was easy. I watched the instructional DVD before I got started and then it literally took me 12 minutes to set up (SIMPLE!!!).The stories are great and the art in the stories is amazing. I highly recommend this to encourage a love of reading.
3,A GREAT item.....when it works - such a shame!,"My twins received this for their 4th birthday and it was so nice to receive an educational yet captivating toy for them. I spent about 20 minutes programming the thing before it tested OK. That was fine because my kids and I loved it. The handset is very easy for them to use, the DVD's themselves are beautifully done, the content of the games and reading comprehension exercises were highly age appropriate and engaging. Then, it stopped working. OK, so I go and spend another 20 minutes reprogramming it thinking that it was because the screw wasn't on tight enough on the lid (the lady's voice started barking orders when I turned it upside down). The kids love it so much we go and buy 2 more DVD's. It stopped working again and I just don't feel like spending any more time on this right now!! Oh well, I'll keep it for when I have nothing better to do only because it is such a neat product - WHEN IT WORKS."
1,Expected quality,"Before buying this item I read a customer review such as this. It said don't buy it as it is a piece of junk. I felt this was just a one in a million ''piece of junk'' as the quality was pretty much guaranteed. NOt so. I sent this to my little grandaughter and, ''guess what''. It didn't work!! Her father spent many hours trying to talk to ''a person''. He was assured that a new one would be sent. It has yet to arrive. Don't buy this ''piece of ----''."
2,Sloooooooow going,"Let me preface this review by saying that it was a gift for my 3 year old son. The age range on the box says ""3-7 years old"". I think an older child might do better with it than my impatient three year old.For starters, my husband, who is a computer programmer, took over 2 hours to get it to work. Maybe this had something to do with our particular DVD player, but it's not that old of a model.Secondly, I find it to be very slow. You can't press a button until the question is COMPLETELY finished. And then it's like, PRESS...wait, wait, wait...then the screen shows your selections...wait, wait...""You're right!"" It takes forever to play the games. My son likes pushing the buttons well enough, but he's used to much more immediate gratification.Once again, this might work out better for an older child, but I wouldn't buy it for a little one."
1,It never worked!!,Well I bought this for my nephew and I never could even get it to program. There is a recording that is supposed to guide you at one point but it never came on for me. I followed the instructions and looked at the troubleshooting but still no voice. I am going to contact the company tomorrow.
3,Constantly repeating same questions,"It seems like it could be very educational if it worked. We get into a story and after about 3 questions, the same story keeps repeating itself over and over. I try to turn the page and I end up having to turn it off and back on again. It's a pain in the butt."
1,Very Dissapointed,"My son got this gift for Christmas and we were very dissapointed to find out (after opening everything) that it would not work with our DVD system We have a Bose Lifestyle system which uses radio waves for the remote so there was no way to program the read with me system. After trying all three methods, we had to call the company and ship everything back to them to get our money back since the products were opened and the store would not return them. No where does it tell you this will not work with certain DVD players which is very important to the consumer. We were really looking forward to using this product with our son and he was dissapointed when we spent an hour trying to program it only to tell him it did not work and he would have to get something else."
3,Good concept but needs work,"This is a really good idea, but has some problems. My three-year old daughter can understand and answer the questions, but she gets frustrated and loses interest because the controller is way too touchy. She doesn't understand why she is answering the question but the game just keeps repeating the question because her answer isn't registering. You have to make sure the controller is pointing right at the dvd player.Also, the game often completely freezes to the point where I can't even remove the disc or turn off the dvd player. I actually have to unplug the dvd player to reset the whole thing....very frustrating for both of us."
3,Hey Ralph,"In response to Ralph (the only other reviewer of this CD at the time I submitted this review), seek out the 2-CD set Manfred Mann's Earth Band - The Very Best of Vol. 1 & 2 Limited Edition (Arcade Deutschland GmbH 1993). I found mine in Tower Records in Paris ... 29 tracks and worth the effort if you're a fan - which I'm guessing you are if you're on this page looking at a best-of import. Good luck!"
5,Great guidebook,There is a ton of great info in this book that you won't find on a campus tour. It's the best thing I've read in terms of giving detail from a student perspective. The author told me everything I wanted to know and a whole lot more. You won't be disappointed if ou pick this up.
5,Awesome!,"This is the scanner you've been looking for -- fast, silent, and a warhorse. Sure, it costs more than the others, but it is just wonderful, and I have already scanned over 1000 pages in less than a week. Couple it with Document Wallet (see versiontracker.com) and you have an ""iPhoto"" system for your documents -- just amazing. Don't even bother looking at the other scanners. This is it."
5,Great Scanner,"This scanner works just as advertised. It is very fast, and wakes from sleep in an instant. Although expensive, I heartily recommend it."
1,Not sure why my two work so differently from everyone else's,"I've got two of these scanners--one at home, one at my office. I've increasingly found myself looking for a sledgehammer when trying to use them. Both of them grab clumps of paper, so that I find myself having to feed documents by holding on to all the pages but one, releasing the rest one at a time. Even then, it still tries to feed multiple pages at a time, and/or feeds pages through at an angle so they crinkle and jam. I have to start over multiple times just to get a single file scanned. I've spoken with company reps who tell me to clean the rollers. It makes no difference. In fact, I found this set of reviews while trying to find an alternative. I'm glad it works for other folks; I just wish that mine worked even half as well."
4,"Good document scanner, could use better software","Like everyone has said, this is a fast, quiet and small scanner. Did I say FAST?Why did I give it only 4 stars? Because the software does not give you enough control. For example, you can only scan in B&W; (1 bit) or color mode. No grayscale scanning. You can only specify scan quality as 'normal,' 'better,' etc. rather than specifying actually dpi. Also, it would be nice to include an OCR program. I use Acrobat 8, and it does a fairly good job of OCR and keeping the original scan at the same time. Very neat.Oh, it jammed a few times when I scanned a stack of probably 20 pages. It was pretty easy to clear the jam though.I also wish it came with PC software so I can share this printer in the office. I haven't try downloading the software on Fujitsu's website yet."
3,slow reading,"While this book does cover facts,its boring. And I am deeply into tudor history.It was a very slow read and took me much longer to read than any other book I have read.I found it very dull and would not recommend this to one who enjoys tudor history, even though it does give you alot of facts.Unless you have a test on king henry VIII wives, its a disappointment."
3,Somewhat slow but still worth reading....,"Antonia Fraser has certainly written more enjoyable works but nonetheless, The Wives of Henry VIII is worth taking the time to finish, especially if you're not very familiar with the subject matter beforehand. She does a fantastic job of laying down facts as with all her historical works but she also injects her own rather 'forgiving' viewpoint regarding the intentions and motivations of the people about whom she writes. Fraser has a wonderful way of exposing the core humanity of characters that most of us have been inclined to view as ruthless, inhuman monsters. I would suggest, however, that one read other not quite so tame opinions because the 'truth' usually lies somewhere in the middle of the extremes."
5,great bed! great price!,"I still can't believe this mattress is so inexpensive. It is very comfortable and well made, and in a pinch, it can become two queen sized mattresses rather than one. We use it as a guest bed, and it has been great. An excellent deal."
2,Lasted less the 4 uses.,"I was very careful when I used this mattress. On the 4 opportunity to use it, It went flat. Where the plastic is welded for the internal baffles, it separated and left a hole, 1/16th of an inch. The leak in the second mattress was undetectable. Research at the Intex site, proved it has a very weak warranty policy. We bought a different brand this time."
2,Goes flat all the time,I bought this airbed and it went flat a few weeks after. Luckily customer service sent another one to me!! But not only it was not double but it also went flat soon after! It could have been a great product if it wasn't going flat all the time!
5,Lesson. to be relearned,"Tuchman's flowing historical review as with her other books shows the strengthenwill.. and frailty of our leaders leading to war, she describes the fog of war in graphic terms, her ability to describe war from various players perspective is riveting. If you like this her march of folly will clarify political and military self delusion and it's consequences. Too bad there will be no more..."
3,Detailed discovery of WWI,"TGOA was not the easiest read, but am certainly more knowledgable about the events leading up to, and first month, of WWI. It is startling to see why an Austrian prince being shot in Serbia lead to the greatest war in history up to its time. Czars, Kings, Generals, and Kaisers are all intertwined in a a new school war fought in old Europe. America is hardly mentioned, due to its late participation in the war and (lack of) foreign policy by President Wilson. Tannenberg, Moise, and Alsace will all become familiar locales by the end of the book as well as French ""elan"". Overall, it was a great portrait into the culture 100 years ago, how war became ""inevitable"", and how dis-illusion of any glory set in after August 1914. Great info, but did seem to carry like a college history assignment."
4,Companions needed,"One of the most detailed book about war, it brings vivid image to the readers and brings them to the first historical month of the WWI. With smartly chosen words, Barbara Tuchman succeded in creating a masterpiece. Unfortunately, for the non-English native speakers...this book is too complicated. If there is no other choice than to read this book, be sure to buy its companions: a dictionary and a thesaurus."
4,Brilliant Easy to Read Narrative,"The Guns of August is an easy to read and flowing history of the early days of World War I. The author does a great job a bringing you up to speed with the state of mind for each of the major players in the early days of the war. The book then moves more or less chronologically through the eve of Marne in great detail. I also like that the author does not take sides. For example, she presents the horrific treatment of Belgium civilians in a matter of fact way but still drives home the terribleness of those actions. The only deficiency (unless this missed it in the notes and sources) is the lack of complete translations for the large number of French phrases used in the book; some of the more obscure are translated but not all. A good English-French dictionary comes in handy."
3,Slogging through France,"I found it a slog to get through the buildup to the battles and the battles themselves, and would have preferred a broader treatment of the whole war. Not my favorite BT book, which is probably her volume on Stilwell, because it illuminates so much about the time, and does not get lost in the Ardennes."
1,Pure Propaganda,"This book is little more than recycled propaganda from about 1915.But it is viciously anti-German and that is enough to make it a ""classic"".Truly one of the great hate books of all time.Germanophobia sells,always has and probably always will.Something for you aspiring historians to keep in mind.If you want to know how WWI really started,read Harry Elmer Barnes or Sidney Fay."
3,Jay,"Book arrived in very timely manner, price was right and in good condition. It is in the queue for reading."
1,Dull Portrait of WWI,This book is dull & drags. The author creates no dramatic tension or excitement. Its a few hundred pages of mainly dreary inconsequential facts with an occasional page or two of something you actually want to know.
1,Worst summer reading I ever had,"I didn't even bother to finish this book because, although i tried to read it and fell asleep on pretty much every other page, the writing was convoluted and stuffy, the ""action"" (was there any?) was slow, and I just couldn't bring myself to care about anything this author had to say. A unanimous vote by the AP Euro class I was forced to ""read"" this for took the book off the reading list for next year's class...although we would have loved to make the following classes suffer the same way we did, we simply could not bring ourselves to stuff this ridiculous book down any other poor students' throats.Mr. M......You were a cool teacher, but I don't know if I can ever forgive you for letting this haunt my entire summer."
5,An August Book,"While it's been a while since I read this, I clearly remember that it was superb. Tuchman's ability to bring history to life is unsurpassed.I'd strongly recommend this book to anyone with the least interest in the subject of WWI. While just using the war's first full month, BT gives us a clear view of that world and its people who became involved in the incredible machine of death that was The Great War.I would also suggest Keegan's ""The First World War"" for a fuller description of the war in its entirety."
4,Terrific Military History of the Start of WWI,"I picked this book up after having read it decades before. The writing and analysis remains as crisp as when I first read it. I believe the strengths of the book are in the great amount of details provided about the military blunders that occured on both sides during the first month of WWI. Its really an always-topical cautionary tale of how egos, a reluctance to engage in diplomacy, all coupled with the fog of war, can play havoc with the best of plans. The weakness of the book is in getting a better sense of the German perspective other than with Tuchaman's occassion expressions on the essence of the German people. Tuchman does give equal play to the German strategy but she falls into far too much stereotype about the German ""character"". While she doesn't dwell on it, she seems all too comfortable in explaning German acts as part of the German belief that efficiency trumps humanity, as an example."
5,Fascinating reading !!!,"The first month of WW I is vividly recreated here, and explains why the great nations put themselves in a mortal stalemate that was to last four years. This book is profoundly serious and informative, and gives the reader a clear picture of what happened in those dread times. It describes the armies of all nations at war, their preparation, their morale (or lack of) and the stupid proud of the leaders. INcridible."
5,WW1,Extreamly well written. One of the best books on the orgins of the war. I didn't know that Germany prior to WW1 was already thinging of expanding it borders. This is way before Hitler was trying to do it.
4,Break out the coloring book,"SUPERBLY written, however, naming off 55 generals at one point, and their specific strategies, positions, and timelines, without much contexet or reminder of who is who, you are left guessing about which countries general's and politicans we are talking about, as you are only told once. Great Britan, France, Germany, Belgum, Russia, Austria etc... If you have crayons and a pad and can keep up, this is the standard by which all historical empirical documents should be compared.Needs to be made into a documentary."
3,Surprisingly boring,"I've been simultaneously listening to an audio version and reading the book, which I have owned for years, but never got around to reading. It's hard to imagine why this was ever considered such a compelling read. Very hard to follow and really rather boring. If you want to read a really great book about World War I, I recommend Paul Fussell's ""The Great War and Modern Memory"" - one of the best books I've ever read, or Robert Graves' ""Goodbye to All That"" - another really great book. The most interesting thing about Tuchman's book to my mind is that it was ever considered some kind of page-turner, or anything but boring."
4,Guns of August,"This is a fascinating account of how a major event (WW I) moved tragically forward, when, with some careful thought and analysis, it could have been avoided."
5,THE GUNS OF AUGUST,One of the most enjoyable (and exciting) accounts of the circumstances surrounding the start of the First World War. Ms Tuchman brings history alive and it certainly changed my opinion on the root causes of the war itself.
3,"Outdated, and not so great","I'm sure I used to have this book and read it in the 60s, but didn't find it on my shelves, so I reordered it. It was once the classic, the bible, concerning the leadup to and breakout of WW I but, Pulitzer notwithstanding, it's not as great as it was ballyhooed. David Fromkin's book on the same period is far superior. This book is marred by notes at end in such fine print that I didn't even bother to read them and, worse, terrible maps - often with their most critical parts on the crease between two pages."
4,Exceptional portrayal of the events and the conduct of WWI.,Too much detail on the specific actions of each combatants military units in the war. Gets difficult to follow. Would have preferred more emphasis on a macro view of the causes and/or a micro view of the average citizens life at home or in the trenches.
3,A Great Historical Documentary But Not For Leisure Reading,"A marvelously researched and well written documentary of the Great War, with all the specifics regarding battles. persons, locations and motivations. WWI was a much more complex event than most people realize, and this book provides a deep educational insight into all of those elements. This is a great work and it has it's place on any noteworthy bookshelf. Nevertheless, this was like reading a college textbook,and definitely not a general overview for leisure reading by the fireplace."
5,A delight!,"This has to be the best Butterfly there is! An awesome, beautiful set! I'm very happy with my purchase!"
5,Callas&Puccini,"Callas was not too fond of Puccini, she preferred Belcanto. But when she DID sing Puccini she made magic. Listen to her Tosca or her Manon to find out. And this Butterfly is no exception. Innocence, love and death has never been portrayed like this! Have a box of tissues nearby!"
2,A BUTTERFLY for the VAULTS,"While I admire the work of Maria Callas, this is ONE opera she should never have done. Nothing could be further from the composer's intent than this recording. Callas has no emotion on the emotional parts, and puts in fortissimo, where it is not called for. Don't get me wrong, there are just better BUTTERFLYs out there, my suggestion is to get one!"
1,"Too old to play a 16 year old child bride, bad sound","The best Butterfly is Freni/Pavarotti by far. Callas sounds old and tired. It is not one of her great roles.Also, the sound quality is atrocious."
5,Top Butterfly,"My favourite Butterfly by far. Here Callas sounds so vulnerable, childlike and sweet... I was totally perplexed... But she developed an entirely different sound for the older Butterfly, thus her reaction to Pinkerton's betrayal makes sense... Just for the words ""Guardami! Amore addio!"" I could die! To comprehend what this miracle of a voice could do compare her Medea (Dark, black, brooding, knowing) to this Butterfly. (Innocent, sweet, vulnerable and tender) Gedda is sensational as Pinkerton (Love him as Don José and Werther as well). A must buy for every fan of great singing."
5,Callas and Gedda SHINE!,"I'm so grateful that Callas and Gedda recorded this.... At last a Butterfly that doesn't annoy me but makes sense.... So many Butteflies (from Toti dal Monte to Miriam Gauci) bored me with their stupidity... But here is a Butterfly that is part of a drama.... Take it or leave it, this is SUBLIME!"
1,"Looks great, but not hardy enough.","The first timer was dead on arrival. I called the customer service line and the telephone rep sent out a replacement right away. No problems there at all. The second timer fell off my fridge when a friend bumped into the fridge and the timer's fall caused battery cover brake. I stuck it back on my fridge anyway. The next time I walked to close the fridge and bumped the fridge, the timer once more tumbled down for its last functional seconds before the screen went permanently blank. This timer looks cool with its finish, but cannot hold up to falls from the normal fridge height, which is right where I keep any magnetic kitchen timer."
2,"ordered two: one worked, one didn't","Have had a good experience with this from before and needed an additional two.Ordered two of these. One works great, one doesn't. It doesn't beep."
2,i order 2 kitchen timers & within a few days the the back broke off the timer.,"I ORDER 2 AMCO TIMERS ON JULY 5,2010. I LIKED THE ONE THAT MY SON HAD.. I BROKE HIS TIMER & THEN ORDER 2 AMCO TIMERS. WITHIN THE FIRST FEW DAYS THE BACK BROKE THAT SETS THE TIMER UP.. I GOT MY HUSBAND TO GLUE IT FOR ME.. BUT I AM UNABLE TO SET THE TIMER UP.. I REALLY THROUGH IT WOULD LAST A LITTLE LONGER THAN THAT!!! I GAVE MY SON THE OTHER TIMER.. HOPE HIS LAST A LITTLE LONGER THAN MIND!!!"
4,Swain back on the case!,"This is another enjoyable entry in the Swain series. The plot is notable for containing a very early description of what would later be called ""virtual reality"" and Mquay once again supplies an abundance of funny one-liners and witty rejoinders, all set in an evocative post-nuke Texas! If Blade Runner and the Fifth Element had been set in Houston, it might look a little bit like this..."
4,Savage Journey,"Book appropriate for young people. Really not a believable adventure, but filled with much description and information about the Amazon Jungle and the people who inhabit it."
5,Savage Journey,I had read this book a number of years ago and always remembered how good it was. I received the book in a very short time and the book was new. I would highly recommend this book it is one of the most descriptive books about the Amazon Rain Forest.
3,Not intuitive.,"First off, you need to be licensed by the FCC to use the long range frequencies. Second, we have four units and we couldn't figure out how to get a one to one conversation going with out the flimsy piece of paper that's supposed to be a manual. The one time we needed it during a camping trip, the batteries were run down after just a few hours on stand by. Lastly, Why would you make them camouflage colored? I dropped on while climbing, the color did its job, it fumbled around looking for it."
5,Great Product,"Its really a great product, its so invisible that you dont realize that you have covered the sockets."
5,Hard to take off,These are more difficult to take off by far. I have a heck of a time...and that's how it should be. I would definitely recommend.
1,Useless: My 1 year old can pull these out!,"These are unfortunately useless since my 1 year old has made it her life's purpose to remove these from the sockets & then try to stick them back in... ummm, not the safest game! I'm buying the more expensive safe plate outlet covers instead (the kind where you replace the entire outlet cover)."
1,Useless,"My 16 month old was able to easily remove these from the outlet. They are cheap and flimsy - go with something stronger. Worst of all, they will provide a false sense of security."
5,It keeps the childern safe,Its child proof and almost adult proof. Its a good tight fit and gives parents peace of mind. Well worth the money.
1,My twins think these are a puzzle toy,These must be an invitation to play with outlets. My 1 year old twins had never played with or near an outlet until I placed these in the open sockets. All of a sudden they were prying these outlet plugs out and bringing them to me. It was ridiculously easy for my not-even-walking-yet little ones to pop these covers off the outlets.
2,My 1 year old can easily remove these from new and old outlets,"While I had difficulty removing these outlet covers, my 1 year old son can immediately pry them off of new and old outlets as his new game. These are pretty thin and sit very flat to the outlet compared to other brands that I can remove slightly easier. When he has bent the plastic prongs, they are pretty much ready for the garbage. If your child isn't as busy (or as strong) as my child I would give these a shot."
2,Your kids won't get these off. You won't either.,"Carry around a flat screw driver and you'll be fine. I don't understand how this has so many stars, the outlets are completely useless with these installed. These things will send mommy diving for the pills."
3,Not for repetative use,"This product works as advertised / serves it's purpose, however they are a pain in the neck to actually take out of the socket. If you're going to be using the plug frequently I don't recommend using this specific item (I have begun taking them out)."
3,Not sure how they will hold up to a toddler,So far these outlet plugs are working with our 8 month old but I have a feeling that a determined toddler will be able to figure them out quickly. They don't have a lot of umph to them.... maybe I will be proven wrong! But for the price they aren't bad.
3,They work!! Maybe too good,These definitely work. I can barely get them out. But that means my little one hasn't got a chance. I have to use the plug of whatever I want to plug in to ply a corner free to then pull it out of the socket. Very tight fit.
2,Still too loose,"I know that most of the reviews say how hard these things are to remove from the outlet, but I didn't find this to be the case. Granted some of our outlets are pretty loose (loose in that things we plug in there tend to fall out), even so it seems like a young one could pull this off and then you have the hazard of the live outlet as well as the choking hazard of the plug itself.Take a look at this video from the Today show for why this is a danger"
5,Gets the job done!,"I tried the fancier ones before I bought these and let me tell yoju, Don't waste your money on those! These are much easier, just pop in and out but not so easy that a child could get them out. I have a 3 year old and a new baby on the way. My 3 year old has tugged at these with no luck and he is very strong for his age. So, if he can't get them out, I don't think any other young child could. Definitely worth it to just buy these, great value for your money!"
5,Basic outlet plug protectors,"We got these to put in all of our exposed outlets to keep our toddler from sticking things in them. They work fine, and he hasn't started trying to remove them...yet. They were inexpensive and serve their purpose."
5,excellent safety product,I would say it is a must buy for every mother. Wonderful product. I am so happy I bought it.
4,"Yes, it's cheap looking but it works","For the price, you really can't complain. And yes, it is hard to take off once you plug it in the socket but at least this means your baby won't be able to take it out either!"
4,"Gets the job done, but hard to remove","The whole point of this product is to prevent children from getting their fingers in outlets, and it does accomplish that very well. I was happy with how inexpensive this product was. However, I will say that they are very difficult to remove... I have never had other outlet plugs so I can't compare, but it is tough to get these out when I need to use an outlet. But it can be done, so overall this was a good buy."
4,Nice product,I found these easy to push into the outlets and difficult for kids to remove so safety wise they are great. I don't have long fingernails so it is difficult for me to remove them. The transparency help these to match any color outlet or switch plate you put them on.
5,Does its job,Made out of plastic. It is not too thin. Can be inserted and removed with ease by adults. Need to wait and check if DD is able to pull them out. After all she has just become a cruiser.
5,Baby safety outlet plugs,These work great! They are even a challenge for adults to get in or out! I love how clear they are and don't draw attention to the outlet. Great product at a great price!
4,Work fine,"These are the first kind that I've ever used, so I don't know any better. They are not very easy to pull out. I give them four stars because I wish that they were a little harder to get out. I think the more you take one in and out of a socket, they wear down and would be easier for a child to take out. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase. They work fine."
4,Works,"Not much to it. Fits my outlets, doesn't shock me when installing or removing, and is a royal pain in the arse to remove which is great because the kids can't remove them."
5,Great!,"These don't break off in the outlets and they're really ""in there."" Our daughter can't get them out but if I need to get to a plug, I can wiggle my nail under the plastic and pull it out."
3,You get what You pay for.,Not bad for the price even though My 15 month old granddaughter is easily able to remove these outlet plugs.So now I am looking at other products.
3,Don't think baby is going to get these out of outlet.,"Very thin material, but I must say once you get it in, it's a challenge to remove it when you are ready to use the outlet."
4,Please - This is not the 1953 Recording and its Stereo!,"I read several reviews that refer to this as the 1953 recording with di Stefano, Gobbi et al. It is NOT! It is her last recording of Lucia, and made when she was already past her prime, in 1959. As mentioned in some of the reviews her 1955 live recording with Karajan is her best, followed by her 1953 recording. It would be unfair to compare her singing at this stage (or even when she's at her best!) with Sutherland as the latter is primarily a coloratura whereas Callas is a dramatic soprano. To compare them is to entirely miss the point and is entirely dependent on our expectations of the music and the singing vs acting. In spite of her flaws I prefer Callas to Sutherland, even in 1959 when her high notes aren't what they should be, because her singing/acting moves me. But if you prefer flawless, serenely, heavenly singing, go for Sutherland. I will refrain from using the word 'canary-like'."
5,I loved this!,"Callas' voice sounds so soft and truly pretty here. It seems that I like her late recordings better, hee hee. But the cast around her is great, Callas sings well and the conducting is good too. I reccommend this!"
3,Eh,"The middle prong broke off after I had to bend it forward to attach my wire. Happy with the product, as it des work, just not happy with the quality of the prongs."
4,"A book you HAVE to read, but might be dissappointed.....","If you read Dragon Seed, the prequel to this book, you will know that you read this book because you couldn't live with the ending that was given! So you read this book and it continues to provide more historical information and answer some of those questions that you had from the last book. However, by the time this book ends, you seem to have more questions than before. I won't spoil it for you, but I was thinking that perhaps the title might explain all unanswered questions simutaneously! Also, the book tends to become a little boring at some parts. Yet every second of boredom is compensated for by later events of extreme excitement. Doubtlessly though, it is a GREAT book and a fine sequel, though more could have been done with the plot. Read it!"
5,The Life of A Girl Growing Up In Maui,"This book was purchased by me on a recent trip to Maui. I bought it in a museum gift shop in Lahaina. I was instantly transported back to Paradise--Maui. This is the story of a young girl being raised on Maui in the days of paniolos(Hawaiian cowboys),horses and cattle. She invites us to share in her adventures being the eldest daughter of a cattle ranch manager.Armine shares her trials, joys and sorrows of growing up in Maui. Encouraged by her loving father, she was taught strive to do her best and to take some risks in life.Many of the places she writes about are places that still interest many of us now. She brings to life a Maui that is far different now.A good book for all ages. Enjoy!"
4,Great hisorical accounts of early 20th century life on Maui.,"Armine Von Tempski grew up on the island of Maui, Hawaii. Her autobiography, 'Born in Paradise', describes in finite detail her love of the islands and the cultural traits of the Hawaiian people. Anyone who has a love of the islands, especially Maui, will enjoy the early 20th century accounts of events that took place. The infantile detail she pays attention to, enhances the beauty of the book. It makes you long for the inner peace of living such an idyllic life.Thanks, Paul M. Goyette"
3,One of Universal's better horror films.,"Stylishly directed by Robert Siodmak and blessed with a literate script, this film emerges as one of Universal's better horror films. The film is particularly good at establishing mood and atmosphere."
2,"Good script, bad acting","The idea of a sequel to ""Dracula"" was a good one, and the script which resulted is also quite good. The problem with this film lies in the casting. When Bela Lugosi made the original, he set a very high standard. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional Chaney simply lacks the ability to portray his character. He sounds as if he is reading his dialogue from cue cards, showing his lack of depth at every turn. Universal must have thought so as well, as this was Chaney's only outing as Dracula (John Carradine played the role in succeeding films). In short, a good script is wasted on the untalented Chaney. Stick with the original - Lugosi was the only real Dracula."
2,Good supporting cast Poor choice of Dracula,"I thought John Carradine was bad as the count in House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula,but comparied to Lon Chaney Jr. His performance looked like Academy award winning acting, If your a collector like I am Buy this if not save your money and rent it or borrow it from a friend. Chaney should have stayed with the wolfman or the mummy roles he excelled in."
3,Entertaining vampire yarn,"Dracula shows up on a southern plantation to claim his vampire bride in this enjoyable slice of horror from Universal Studios. Surprisingly, the special effects are pretty good for the era, and Lon Chaney, Jr, doesn't make a bad vampire. It's no masterpiece, but it's fun."
5,Son of Dracula one of Chaney's best,"Most people think that Lon Chaney, Jr's presese hurt this film and ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" and that he should've just been Larry Talbot. Personaly, the only Dracula better than Chaney was Bela Lugosi in my opinion. Dracula (calling himself Alucard)goes to America. I have seen the ending, and it was OK. The film's problem is that the title does not describe the film. (spoiler)"
3,offbeat chiller favourite,"Classic horror movies rarely get wackier than SON OF DRACULA, Universal's offbeat chiller from 1943 starring Lon Chaney Jr. and Louise Allbritton.Katherine Caldwell (Allbritton), a wealthy Southern heiress with morbid fixations, decides to marry card-carrying vampire Count Alucard (Lon Chaney Jr.) despite the objections of her boyfriend and family. Of course, the Count's true motive is to re-establish his reign of terror in a new country. The performances of ""Wolf Man"" Lon Chaney Jr. and Louise Allbritton (who seems to relish her part as the off-kilter heiress) save this film from total failure. Scream queen favourite Evelyn Ankers also has a substantial role."
2,A Dracula who has dined on more than blood,"Count Dracula's diet consisted of blood primarily drawn from the necks of lovely Universal starlets. Lon Chaney, Jr. had a more varied diet and, according to Gregory William Mank's ""It's Alive"" (a terrific book about the studio's Frankenstein series), the son of the legendary man of a thousand faces was also a heavy drinker. Chaney is certainly heavy in ""Son of Dracula,"" looking more like a football player than the king of the undead, and his miscasting sinks an otherwise sturdy chiller. The right mood is maintained throughout but the lack of a convincing Count all but demolishes the effort. Bela Lugosi, where are you?"
1,Flat and Disppointing,"Maybe there are two ways of writing about travel. First, you write about startling things or things that other people normally might not notice. Second,you present a somewhat ordinary world but you do so in high-flown prose that---because of the quality of the writing---carries the reader along no matter what. This journalistic travel book seems one that a publisher might have picked up ONLY because the writer is well known. It is neither well written nor particularly acute in what it sees and reports. Too often there is a grim habit of stereotype, and always there is a languid sense of a prose style that suggests little more than some jottings in a loose-leaf along the way. A Graham Greene brings heart, keen perception, and inspiration to his ""Journey without Maps"" into Africa, and may other writers encounter people who remain in your mind. Celati just putters along."
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars. I can give it to u for free.,This book & the author's classes are both useless. I have been to one of his 2-day courses. The book is a collection of his class-notes. He says the same thing over-and-over in different words & ways. This book is not worth a single penny.
5,"Career Adventure: Guide to Personal Assessment, Career Exploration and Decision Making","This is a great book. Even after you take the class, I recommend you keep the book. There are a lot of things in this book on finding a job, interviewing, resume writing, etc., that can help you in the future."
3,interesting but far from timeless,This is an interesting solo effort from Jennifer Herrema--but it fell out of my rotation pretty quickly.
3,Minnesota atlas,"For the past several years, we have relied on atlases from Benchmark Press for our summer travels. I wish they made one for Minnesota. The Delorme atlas is no where near as clear and comprehensive as the Benchmark. I was quite disappointed. The dealer the book came from was wonderful - quick and accurate about condition."
2,My Baby Prefers His Other Nursery Rhyme Video!,"I had high hopes for this product, until I witnessed my child's underwhelming reaction to it. He didn't even make it through the tape once. I don't know why this is. His favorite nursery rhyme video is ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time."" In this video, the babies look like they are singing the songs. Perhaps this added element is what captivates my son. Afterall, babies do love to look at other babies. In short, pass on ""Baby Genius."" I wish I had."
4,Classical European Liszt,An outstanding performance that captures the mid-20th Century classical piano style rather than the emphasis on virtuosity exhibited by today's performers. There is as much beauty in the silence between notes as in the runs and arpeggios. Classic in the style of Kempff.
5,Amazingly beautiful,"Manon Lescaut, one of Puccini's greatest operas! And this is the recording to buy, Maria Callas, prima donna assoluta per sempre!"
3,callas was not a puccini singer,"Perhaps it is blasphemy coming from an ardent Callas fan but her Puccini performances are somewhat cold. She lacks the understanding of the character which made Albanese's performances so wonderful and does not possess the vocal morbidezza of Tebaldi. As she had never performed the role of Manon onstage, the character seems to evade her and the ending of the opera is lacking in pathos. Di Stefano is thrilling. Giulio Fioravanti plays Lescaut as the traditional clown. Serafin's conducting is beautiful with great attention to detail."
1,Only buy if you worship WWF RAW: The video game...,"The only thing that this video contains is WWF superstars telling you cheat codes for WWF RAW. It is a waste for money to buy this, because you can find all the infomation on this video elsewhere on the internet for free."
5,"Angela Hewitt plays Bach's ""Goldberg Variations""","Although Glen Gould's 1955 recording (the fast one) has always been my favorite, I was inspired to buy this CD after attending a concert with Ms. Hewitt playing Bach keyboard concertos. She has a completely different interpretation of the Goldberg.It is at once majestic and intimate. There are many expressivedepartures which make the contrapuntal lines more exciting than anything I have heard before. I heartily recommend this recording to anyone who loves Bach."
5,"Attention, Extraterrestrials!","If the human species wishes to announce the existence of intelligent life on Earth to the rest of the universe, just continually beam to the stars this recording of Angela Hewitt playing the Goldberg Variations. Of course, it would be boasting, both of the composer and the performer - but shouldn't we send examples of our best?"
5,I was married to this soundtrack...,"Isham's score for ARRTI is almost as good as the novella itself, so well done in fact that my wife and I asked a friend to arrange the title theme for guitars as our wedding processional a decade ago. I bought the CD within days of first seeing the film and have doubtlessly played it through well over 1,000 times...it's the most played recording I own, and I likely have in excess of 4,000 albums/discs on hand. The score does for the movie what Redford hoped the movie would do for the book-- it takes it to another level, provides a synergy that yields more than the sum of the parts."
5,This CD is a must have for all lovers of movie soundtracks!!,"If you like Dancing with Wolves, Legends of the Fall, and Wyatt Earp Soundtracks, then you will love this CD!!"
5,Too close ? Yes.,"If I am not mistaken you are a member of the band. Thanks for the heads up on the re-release. I have ""Faith Healer"" on a compilation and look forward to hearing more from Big Dipper. Cheers!"
2,"well-intentioned, but flawed, guidebook","This book has many typographical errors and some scientific errors as well. Intended to reach a nonscientific audience, the authors have oversimplified many topics to the point of giving incorrect information. Nonexpert secondary teachers, for whom the book is intended, will not be well-served and will convey incorrect information to their students if they rely heavily on this volume to the exclusion of other scholarly references in the areas of limnology, zoology, entomology, and general biology. Other general guidebooks, such as the Golden Guides or National Audobon Series provide better information, although not tailored for an educational purpose. Teachers should use this book with caution with respect to the scientific material. Although the science-in-action concept is pedagogically appealing, there are too many errors in this book. With a thorough editing by a knowledgeable expert, this could be a useful tool for the high school classroom."
3,Once Again Marc Singer is better than the material,"The movie is not bad for a ""B"" flick. Marc Singer's talent once again transends the material. I don't understand why this gifted actor toils in B movie hell."
1,A walk in the clouds,"I have not received the item that I ordered April 30,2010.I keep tracking it and it never seems to leave Bell,Ca. As of right now I'm not at all happy."
4,Still the best,"Thomas Bros' map books are legendary. I've seen copy cat books, but none compare for accuracy, detail, and organization. The book format is both an asset and a hindrance. No more trying to look at a 2' square piece of paper while driving. On the other hand, you have to flip through pages, which loses some of the sense of continuity of a regular map. Anyways, I won't leave home without it."
5,Saved a bunch,"While searching for a cd recorder, I read a review that mentioned this unit and decided to try it (about 20% of the cost of a cd recorder). This is easy to use and does a terrific job. Try it, you'll like it."
5,Xitel INport Deluxe [Record From Your Stereo to Your Computer],"Xitel INport Deluxe [Record From Your Stereo to Your Computer]The product performs as advertised. The patch cord from stereo to computer is long enough to stretch across two rooms, and delivers good quality sound reproduction. The manual is easy to understand, and I learned the editing technique with very little stress."
3,recorder,It works! the page I'm getting does not expand and cannot see the dialog boxes and windows to check to see if I'm in the right recording (records or tapes) volume scales is partially blocked. I'm not a computer Guru and do not know if re-install will fix it in Windows 7 but everything works connected directly to the computer using a pre-amp after the turn table to computer.
2,It is not Mac compatible,I just got it with the illusion to transfer my vinyl and cassettes but in no one place said it is no compatible with Mac!!!! is the only one system that I haveXitel INport Deluxe [Record From Your Stereo to Your Computer]
3,Setup Wasn't Easy but End Result Is Pretty Good,"I used this on a PC with Windows 7, and had quite a bit of frustration until I found a website that led me to the update for that version. I had earlier tried to get this to work with our Mac without success, but understand there is a way to do that.Note that this converts your analog signals to .wav format, so you wil need to compress the files.The ripper feature, which separates out the tracks, works really well."
5,Fully Satisfied,"This product works as advertised. I have used it lots, and will be using it lots more. It is well worth the money and I would highly recommend it for people that want to digitize their old LP albums. It records an entire record, takes out the crackles & pops, and then separates the songs. Is life great, or what?"
4,Works Great!!,"Got it so I could use my old LPs. Easy to use, straight-forward installation, and the furnished software is fabulous. Cleans up skips and pops on the surface of the LP. Highly recommended."
3,"Good, But With Headaches","I am very pleased to have my LPs converted to CDs. I found Wave Corrector to be amazing. The audio quality is much better than the LP itself. But, I had various problems with the software.Ripper is supposed to split one side of an LP into individual tracks. But I had instances where Ripper would split the first song into five segments and then the rest of the album side is lost. The software should be modified to eliminate the need to select how many songs are on the album side. Then one can merge segments of a song together and not lose part of the LP side.I had problems with LP Recorder. For two songs, it would stop after one minute. I tried this over and over, and never was able to capture these songs.Even so, I recommend this product because one gets quality CDs from an LP collection as an end product. But, the process of getting there can be a real headache."
5,Works as advertised,This product is simple to install and works as advertised. I tried doing the lp to cd conversions with my PC sound card but the stereo did not work and only one channel came through properly. I did try to convert a mono record (Hi-fi from the 50's) and the DeClick software would not recognize the file. I just reconverted using the stereo setting and everything seemed to work.
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"After wasting 6-8 hrs. on this piece of garbage, I finally gave up.If you enjoy frustration, this is the product for you, otherwise,don't waste your time or money."
1,"What a waste, I wish I could give it zero stars","So I waste $80 on this piece of junk, get it home, put it on the computer, and there's no sound. No matter what I do, I can't get it to work. Don't even waste your money."
3,Should have read the info closer,I haven't used the software. I screwed up. all I wanted was a RCA to USB connector. This product comes with the software for converting vinyl to digital. I already had a software program for that so I cannot speak to quality of their software or ease of use
5,Big Value-Little Package,"Lots of good things to say about this ""package"" of Analog to Digital processor/Easy to Use, Powerful Track Editing Software, Quality Connection Cables, and Ordinary Language Instructions.Take the analog audio output from anything,(headphone jack, cassette deck, radio, TV, turntable) and create digital files for your computer library, or burn to CD's.Software lets you divide and name each song/section as you like. Software also removes ""pop""s from LP record copies.This is a ""Windows"" based instruction manual. (don't know if it will work with Mac)As with most turntables... the signal must be first amplified by your usual means (stereo/audio amp/reciever), and then sent to the INport Deluxe.This type of recording is done at the same speed playback as your tape deck or LP turntable, so all you need now is the time to devote to saving your collections to Digital."
4,Nicely done.,I picked this up as a present for my wife. We've found it very easy to use to convert albums/cassettes into MP3s.The initial setup only took us about 15 minutes and we haven't had any problems with the outcome. It's nice and easy in that with a $4 converter you can pretty much plug it into any record/tape player via the headphone jack and you're ready to go.I'm very happy with the purchase.
4,Good Product,"Xitel INport Deluxe does work well and is very simple to set up and use. My problem was the input from the older stereo I was using it on was at too high a level and causing distortion. It would have been useful to have some adjustable attenuation built into the interface. I ended up running the cables through an old Radio Shack audio mixer which knocked the signal down to an acceptable level.I am hanging onto this useful device. I think it is very straight forward and useable by most people with a basic knowledge of PC and audio (like, how to plug it all together and install the software). However, if I had it to do over I would have bought a less expensive interface (USB external sound card) and purchased Roxio and a mixer to have more flexibility."
1,No tech support for running on mac parallels,I have been trying to set this up to convert my music. And they refused to even try to help me just because I am using it on my mac running parallels.
1,"If You Run Win7, Fuhgettaboutit!","This works fine under XP, but if you have Windows 7, the software doesn't show the Inport USB. I even upgraded the software, from a company called ""share*it, a service of Digital River"" at a cost of $19.95. Still no go. By the way, it doesn't like the regular sound card, either. When I tried to complain or seek technical support, guess what -- there's no ""Contact Us"" on the web site. So, they got me, but don't let them get you. Caveat emptor, folks."
5,Works great!,My Grandpa has been wanting to put his records on to CD so he can listen to them in the car. I bought and installed this for him. The program is easy to figure out and I even taught him how to use it. He's currently in the basement listening to the records as he records them on to the computer. Great product.
4,In A Nutshell: INport Works and It's Easy to Use,"Having tried several stream recorders to convert my cassettes to digital,with mixed results at best, I have to say that Xitel INport Deluxe, Works!When I first received it, I set it up only to find (to my dismay) thatI could not hear anything coming from my speakers, I referred back to themanual, checked several customer reviews (they do help)figured out what Iwas doing wrong, and then once I found a headphone jack with RCA femaleplug-ins I was go to good, within 2 hours I had 3 cassettes recorded,splitand stored in my external drive, the sound quality is great, I'm converting18 year old cassettes (some even older than that)no tape hiss! I haven'tconverted them to MP3 yet, but as WAV files they do sound good.It's any easy product to install,configure and use, the manual explainseverything clearly, step by step, INport really is a godsend to anyonearchiving their analog recordings."
5,Still working very well after over 3 years!,"I have used this to put over 100 vinyl albums and at least as many tapes onto CDs. It comes with software that clean out most of the ""clicks"" on the vinyl, and it is easy to separate tracks. Well worth its price. And, in addition, it came with about 15 feet of heavy-duty copper cable!"
4,Very easy to use,I got this couple of month ago as my Creative product died after 2 years. I have converted about 100 tapes to CD's as well as mp3 files. I have used this product to take the audio output from my old Nakamichi tape deck and hook it up directly with the USB port of my PC. The softwar is amazingly easy to install and use. The configuration infromation for the PC is accurate and easy to follow. The editing software is user friendly and easy to use.
1,NOT FOR MAC,"Got this because no where in the description or the reviews did it give the computer requirements. I have a Mac and this will only work on PC's. So here they are:Minimum System Requirements:Windows 98SE, ME*, 2000, XP or VistaBuilt in USB PortPentium 300 MHz or equivalent32MB RAMCD ROM drive* ME users must have installed Microsoft USB audio update.Rated 1 star so this makes the board, but I have an old PC lying around and will give it a try."
1,Old technology. Can't get it to work right,"Ad makes it sound easy. HA! Finally got it to record, but then it was not the whole song- What pain-A total loss."
1,xtel what the hell,"i know i spelled it wrong but it took me weeks to figure out this thing. it never worked right and i actually never really figured it out. from the sound of things it sounded like i needed to download another application for it to work right or something. unfortunately i ended up buying a music box i will call it and pretty much have it figured out after a few hours of tinkering with it. the music box cost me 80 dollars compared to 11 or something for the xtel. like they say, you get what you pay for"
4,"Great Hardware, OK Software","Usually when it comes to stuff like this I am very cautious, but the price was right and I needed something to record my mixes to my computer. The hardware works great! The INport RCA-to-USB hardware has been a great investment, but the software is kind of lacking. The built in software does NOT offer MP3 support (can't save files as mp3), but if you're looking to record your vinyl to .wav and then convert from .wav to MP3, it's not a bad system to have. With options like pop and hiss removal, it's a good way to save your record library."
5,Xitel INport Deluxe,This is a great little gadget. I am using it on my laptop to record my old music to CDs. It couldnt be easier. Just follow the directions and your off. Glad I got it.
3,Software Problem,"I found that this unit does not come with the lastest software. The LP Ripper and LP Recorder software in the package is Version 2.8.6 and now there is a version 10. According to the software producer the software that I received was produced prior to the release of Windows 7. For an additional $28.05, CFB Software will gladly sell me an upgrade. While the product works, I cannot get the ""free"" software to convert the .wav files to mp3 files because I don't have the latest version."
4,Good product,"Software could be easier to use. I have Cakewalk and it is easier to seperate the tracks and save to MP3. They recommend Audacity (Free web download)for other editing functions, but I found it hard to use. The sound quality is great, depending on your turntable. Also the picture on the package is deceptive, giving the impression you can connect directly to a turntable. You must patch through a pre-amp or the audio out on your receiver."
2,Be sure you know what this does - and does not - do before you buy it.,"This review is about the current (works with Windows Vista) version of the product. The devil is in the details. If you flip the box over, in fine print, you will see that this product will not work if you plug your turntable directly into it. Tape decks and other audio products can be plugged in directly and will work fine; but not turntables. If you want to transfer LPs, you need to dig out your receiver or amplifier with phono jack inputs, bring it to your computer work area, and then connect this product to your receiver or amplifier. Either that or buy a separate phono preamp to use instead. The packaging and advertising says the box contains everything you need. Yes, if you are just doing tapes. No, if you want to do LPs or 45 RPMs."
4,Easy setup,This product arrived in top shape faster than 1st class mail. I am no electronic pro but the setup was perfectly simple. I have tons of old jazz cassettes that had been sitting in the closet and just asking to go on Wav to a permanent Mp3 player. Perfect for the gym workout.
2,Does it come with a disc?,I don't know what's going on? Is there supposed to be a disc with this? We didn't get one and can't get anything to work.
5,Xitel INport Deluxe [Record From Your Stereo to Your Computer],I am quite happy with the INport Deluxe. It has performed just as it was advertised to do on their site.
2,no workee,"It wouldn't work with my Vista OS computer, even though it said it would in the ad and the instructions. Returned it for a refund."
1,hard to use,yuk! It does not load very easily. Directions are very vague. Just could not get it to work as advertised!
3,"Very good, although a bit confusing...","I read this book as an assignment for an extra reading group I'm in. There are definately some funny lines in the book, but I don't think the overall story was that interesting. I suggest it to kids ages 11-14. The reason I suggest it to older kids is because younger kids wouldn't understand it so much. I really did like it, though. Give it a try, you might love it!"
2,Feh.,"I love Feiffer, especially his other kids' books. And I had heard much about this one -- but honestly, my 7-year-old and I were slogging through it, chapter by dreary chapter...and finally put it down, about 2/3 of the way thru, just giving up. A few high notes here and there but for the most part UNfunny. UNFeiffer."
4,maximum satisfaction guaranteed.,In this album the mighty sparrow has captured the essence of african spirituality and skilfully wrapped it into the vibrant syncopation of caribbean rhythmns. Listen to gunugu and experience the ecstacy of this afro-caribbean soul massager. It is zesty!
2,Inside great - outside temp unreliable,"I bought this have at work and planned on buying a second eventually to replace my similar functioning unit at home. This unit setup quickly and gives a nice display of time/date/internal temp, but the external receiver is unreliable. I haven't even placed the second unit outside and it is losing signal needing a reset a couple of times a day - from five feet away! I wish I had tried it sooner and not thrown out the packaging as I would return it if I had."
3,Guys and weather radios....,"I don't know what it is about weather tools, buy guys love them. I bought this because I believed it was a good deal and instead of watching the weather channel, I figured that this would give me a more localized weather forecast as it says that it can determine the weather around you for the next 12 hours. The temperature is accurate, but a lot of times it says heavy rain when it is sunny and there is not a cloud in the sky. Sinking the device was a little challenging for whatever reason, but once working everything is fine. Overall it is a neat little affordable gadget, but not very accurate if you are dependent on the accuracy of its weather forcasts."
3,overrated,"I have to agree with other negative reviewers that the product only functions as an indoor-outdoor thermometer. The graphic weather predictions are only right by coincidence, although the animation is cute. And the atomic clock is useless unless you live within 900 miles or the national radio server, which I don't. Apparently some other self setting clocks don't have this limitation."
1,"Weather info wrong, outside temp off, atomic clock not working","The very reason you buy this is to have atomic clock, outside temp, and weather info. It frequently tells me outside is raining when there is no rain in sight. Outside temp is inaccurate, and very slow to respond, Atomic clock show no signal. I have La Cross brand, it is much better."
1,does not reach,"I have out this all over the outdoors and it still does not work. It cindicted out of sunlight, no doors or walls, yet outside to read the temparature. It still does not work for the outside temperature."
2,Small but heavy,This knife was too heavy and did not fit comfortably in my hand. I bought it with the idea of using it to peel fruit.
2,Beware--High Maintenance,"My wife and I were looking to upgrade our Henkel knives and we thought we had found the ultimate kitchen knife in the Shun Ken Onion series. The handle is very comfortable and the blade is excellent. However, despite what seemed like constant attention to quickly drying these knives, each one that we purchased began to rust within a week, just like the Jerusalem Steel they are designed to excel. We were so conscientious that I can't imagine more more we could have done. We were told by store clerks that they have never heard of this, but it happend to each of our knive. I urge any buyer to research this risk and the required maintenance fully."
3,Inspiring and funny!,"I really enjoyed reading The Charge of the Tigers. The story of Maureen and John, their strength and courage, there love for life, their mutual love and desire to help build self esteem in the young boys, and their love for each other, was very inspiring! There were many times, as I read the book, I found myself relating to some of the situations. Although I picked up the book because I know the author, I found it very worth my while reading it."
5,Aladdin is one of the best Disney videos of all time!,"Aladdin is one of the best Disney classics of all time! The story is about a so called Street Rat named Aladdin with his copanion Abu, who befriends a genie and falls in love with a princess named Jasmine. Once he wishes to be a prince to marry Jasmine, but Jafar, the sultin's most trusted advisor, finds out that Aladdin has the lamp he wants. He has his parrot Iago take the lamp and wishes to become sultin. But Aladdin outwits and defeats Jafar. He lives happily ever after with his princess."
4,Very nice book!,"It has 4 1/2 stars. I was lucky that my school still has those old Chernev's chess books; strange that it has more old than new ones (???, butget cuts). Anyway these Chernev's books are in high quality. He and Reinfeld were the two most chess teachers and authors. Reinfeld, as I recalled from memory, was a stronger player but Chernev's books are always better. When they combined their work, we as benefitors have the best of both worlds. This book has lots of facts, many valuable stoties, games, and puzzles. At the time when annotation was not deliberately shared, this book was good. Now we expect more from the authors to share their thoughts and secrets. A little more work then it can get a 5-star rating."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"There is no phone number to call if you are having trouble. Well, there is but you have to pay a monthly fee for ArcSoft's support. So I had to e-mail them. I did this about two weeks ago and they have yet to respond. Gheldmandare doesn't give out a phone number. My computer does not recognize the hardware. I have replaced the cable and USB cord. I have Vista. It should work for Millenium and above. It's not working."
5,Cornwell's Sharpe series,I really have enjoyed the history and adventure of the entire Sharpe series and recommend it to any with an interest in both.
4,Sharp' Tiger has bite,A great introduction to the characters of this series of books. This historical background provides an interesting hook to the fictional and historic characters portrayed leading up to and participating in the siege.Recommended for lovers of history and a good yarn.Bernard Cornwell's style makes for compulsive reading
4,Excellent Historical Fiction,Very good combination of well-researched historical fiction with an exciting (if rather implausible) adventure yarn.
5,I want it in hardback.,I have the complete Sharpe's collection in hardback. Why can I not find this sellection in hardback to complete the Cornwell section of my library? I understand that the next installment is in hardcover. P.S. When will the next Starbuck book be released?
2,Sharp's Tiger--a pussy cat,"I was expecting the literary equivilant of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, and was disappointed to learn that it was merely ""good trash,"" O.K. for a vacation read, but just barely. My interest in reading the rest of them evaporated."
5,"A right, ripping, sizzling yarn of classic daring do !","I was particularly taken by this books clear and easy to read style, coupled with a story that flowed effortlessly. Late 18th century drama unfurls convincingly with rich colours, good imagery and well crafted human relationships and I found myself observing Sharpe as if he were my friend. His relationship with Lieutenant Lawford becomes deeper as the adventure rattles on, and more interesting, when contrasted with the brutal and savage natured Sergeant Hakeswill. I found a bit of myself in all the characters, and that was this books special charm. In all, it was well written armchair reading: ""Boys Own"" action adventure stuff...."
3,"Great book, terrible editing","I picked up this book for my new Kindle after going through the 'Sharp Practice' wargames rules by Toofatlardies. It's exactly as I expected - Napoleonic-era horse and musket combat, great characters, and plenty of historical references.So why 3 stars? The editing - it's utterly horrible. You'll get at least 1 mistake every 2 pages, and most of the time you'll get a lot more than that. It ruins to books when I'm grinding my teeth due to every 'y' translating into a 'v' because the publisher was too lazy to edit eBook when they release it.If you're someone who can glance over such mistake, then you'll enjoy the book. I'm hoping 'Sharpe's Triumph' will be a bit better."
5,This Tiger is no pussycat!,Exceptional and exciting. The one disappointment is that it is so fast-paced that you'll not want to put it down and therefore it won't help you kill time at the airport.
4,Soldiers and whores,This exciting story about horrible things happening to not so good of a guy half makes me wish to go to India and get a whore and shoot up a city.
1,Kindle edition is horribly edited!,"There are so many mistakes in the Kindle edition of this book, that it is utterly painful to read! Don't waste your time or your money. The story on the other hand is magnificent, just read it in paperback."
5,simple and well done,"The start of an amazing series. There aren't any deep messages written in these pages, but it is just a good, solid, entertaining story."
3,Tippoo the brutal dictator? umm...,"While the book is entertaining, I just want to point out that many people from Karnataka (former Mysore state) do not see Tipu Sultan as a brutal dictator but as a patriot and a martyr. This doesn't detract from the book's merits as an entertaining novel in any way, however."
5,Now I understand all the hype!,"This is the first Sharpe novel I have read, although I did catch some of the TV series. I am not a fan of multiple formula novels churned out by lazy writers, and I was suspicious of this series.But Cornwell has done something different here. He has taken real events, from the career of Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington). Then he has inserted the character of Richard Sharp, a canny ex-thief ranker in the British Infantry. One of the men Wellington was to describe as ""Scum of the Earth"" after Badajoz. From the viewpoint of Sharpe we see the business end of the British Army, a worms eye view of the rise of Wellesley and the Indian and Peninsular campaigns.What you are getting is real history fleshed out with a cracking good story. And it is very well done! I am very tempted to dig further into this substantial series of books. I can see why they have become so popular."
4,The genesis of Cornwell's Sharpe Saga,"After having read the Starbuck serie (Civil War) fromB. Cornwell, i had great expectations. To my great delight, the samefeeling of plunging in the middle of an historical battlefield seized me after a few pages, making me forget about (every bloody thing I had to do in) my new house for a few hours.SHARPE'S TIGER is the first in the serie (of about 12) in chronological order. Even though Mr. Cornwell does'nt write them this way, if you want to appreciate the historical flavor and Sharpe's career in Her Majesty's army, you want to read them chronologically.The reader looking for nice fancy figures of speech will be left unsatisfied. Political correctness is also left in the closet. It is blunt, direct cannon-fodder daily life we are looking at and it is written that wayOne thing is sure, we will all finish that book with the smell of gunpowder floating around us and a smile in the historical note about general Wellington"
3,Another Cornwell hit!,"Bernard Cornwell is a master of historical fiction. As with Agincourt, Warlord chronicles and the last kingdom, I could not put this book down. This novel is not the period setting story detailed in the above mentioned books rather it follows the exploits of a great soldier in the exciting battles by the british in India. As with all Cornwells books it is set in a wonderfully adventurous time period, relaying historically interesting periods of war hungry rulers on groups of amazingly strong people. A little slow starting but stay with it , you will be rewarded. Editing errors are unexcusable as noted in previous reviews."
5,Sharpe's Tiger,"I have read all the Sharpe's books thru the years. I love them all. My son likes to listen to audiobooks and I think he will enjoy these books as much as I do, so even though I own the book, I bought the audio version so he could listen to it."
2,Written For 14 Year Old Boys From 50 Years Ago,"I expected to find solid adult historical-fiction from the early period of the Napoleonic Wars. Instead I got simplistic adventures, stock characters and a dopey narrative full of spies and Tigers and prison escapes and implausible derring-do. This reminds me of the old Flashman series of books that I thought was so clever when I was a kid. But those were satire. Unless Sharpe's Tiger is meant to be Young Reader fiction or is a tongue-in-cheek satire I have to assume that the author is an overrated hack who can write decent dialog but is totally clueless when it comes to plot or character."
4,Ethical Living,"This is a great introduction to ethical living. It is easy to read and very amusing. The information is simple and easy to understand (I think implementing it is the challenge!). If you've read other books on ethical living or magazines such as the ecologist, then this won't add anything new or shocking, but for those new to the subject I can't recommend it enough. Well worth a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Nothing New,"Calling this book ""A Life Stripped Bare"" is an insult to the hundreds of thousands of people who lost literally everything to natural disasters in 2005.This is a pop media journalist's narration of his own bland foray into ""living ethically."" There is not a single suggestion in the book that any moderately environmentally-aware person has not heard a dozen times; buy organic, local food; try to get rid of your car; don't eat meat; avoid chemicals. It's somewhat funny at times, but it's really only revelatory if you think food is born in the back of a grocery store and you've never heard of recycling.A far more useful read is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/060980281X/qid=1133830624/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-7014812-3547267?s=books&v;=glance&n;=283155"">The Consumer's Guide to Effecive Environmental Choices</a>, which is a scientificly-derived explanation of the top environmental choices individuals can make to impact the environment."
5,Excellent,"This is a very fine recording. Perhaps it is down to her interpretation of Amina -or perhaps she found the lighter roles of the repertoire more conducive at this point in her career- but I believe that here her voice is easier in the higher regions, and more fluid and silken throughout, than any other recording since her Rigoletto recording from September 1955. That recording (about 18 months earlier than this Sonnambula) was, in turn, the greatest of her recordings since the famous Norma, in 1954 with Serafin. The bel canto operas of Donizetti, Bellini and, to a lesser extent, Rossini always did show her at her best. Monti is a worthy partner; he has a fine grasp of the florid music. The sound is consistently fine. Votto's conducting can occasionally be crude and dull in some of his recordings, but here he gives quite a good account of the score, although it lacks the sparkle that Bernstein brought to it (EMI, 1955 (LIVE)).Highly recommendedD. Bennett"
4,My review,"I haven't listened to this recording yet. However, I am giving Callas the benefit of the doubt by giving this recording four stars. I would like to clear up some things. Sutherland had a huge voice. So did Callas. To say that Sutherland had a Wagnerian-sized voice while ignoring the size of Callas' voice in order to criticize Sutherland is very vindictive and misinformed. Also, it is not Sutherland's fault that her voice was even through all scales and all registers. I happen to like a voice with such evenness. Please do your research before writing your critical reviews and try to be fair in your assessment of great singers like Sutherland."
3,wheels a little stiff,"The price is great, the construction is great, the comparisson to TV show is impeccable (looks exactly like the models on the TV/DVD shows)..but the wheels are a little stiff to turn. Just pulling two of these cars (ya, I bought two...have you ever seen just ONE troublesome truck on the show...there's always a bunch of them!) made my Percy's wheels spin. I've tried some model grade lubricant in the small pockets, but they're still stiff. Any ideas? Otherwise, a good representation and a tough little railcar!"
3,Funny sketches... uninspired DVD.,"You might think an Eric Idle compilation DVD from the Monty Python series would be great -- but there's something not quite right about this collection. For one thing, the sketches are clumsily edited, and taken out of their original context -- so the ""How To Do It"" sketch pans over to the beginning of a scene involving Michael Palin and Terry Jones as old women -- then abruptly cuts away from it.Second, several of the skits are from the Hollywood Bowl film, which has a completely different look and feel from the TV series. The transition can be somewhat jarring.Lastly, some of the skits don't feature Idle at all.It's nice to see some original material from Idle at the beginning of the disc, but sadly -- it's not all that funny.Most of the sketches that are on the DVD are very funny indeed, however. Too bad the DVD compilation is just a little uninspired."
2,many sketches missing portions,"Having bought this as a part of the box set of Personal Best disks because I saw that it listed a particular sketch I wanted, I was very disappointed to find out that there are only small portions of many of the sketches.For example, every disk in its intro, references the Argument Clinic sketch, BUT, the sketch is never shown! There are a few seconds of the lead in to the sketch but not the argument itself!"
1,completely butchered version of a great movie,"It's a complete shame that they choose to release Erik the Viking here in the U.S. in this butchered down version of the movie (25% of it has ben removed in this ""Director's Cut""). This wouldn't be so bad if they also included the Theatrical version as they are doing with the UK release. As it is there is no way I'm paying any money for this hacked up piece of a once great film."
1,Drastically edited version,"It's worth noting that this is a *drastically edited* version of the original. The original was ~100 minutes, this one is ~75 - 25% of the movie has been removed and the remaining sections reordered/edited. So think carefully if you are going to purchase this expecting it to be the movie you remember."
1,This is a travesty,"This new release is NOT the movie my wife and I love. It is 25 minutes too short, and God knows what's been done to it. It was fine as it was. Those who purchase this abomination will be subjected to Bill Jones' ""vision"" of this movie. Forget it. We have the original on videotape, and will just have to be satisfied with that. Better that than encourage this sort of vandalism."
1,What a worthless Dog turd,"Do not bother buying this movie it has scenes out of order, errors in the audio and 25% of the movie is gone leaving you wondering what the hell is going on."
1,erik the viking,"I love this movie so i bought it for my daughter to watch on dvd,so she could retire her video,but instead i wasted my money on this movie because it is chopped up and no worth watching.The best thing is to keep watching the video if you own a copy or if not just buy the video.Really to rate this dvd is a zero not a one.I think MGM needs to start leaving the movies the they was made unstead of chopping it to pieces and they would not get bad remarks from people who love movies like this"
1,0 stars to Son of Jones & Amazon,"This DVD is advertised under ""Product Details"" as having a ""Run Time"" of ""107 minutes.""When the DVD arrived I checked the back and the run time was 79 minutes.On top of that, all I get when I try to return it unopened to Amazon is ""Error On Page"" and it won't let me get beyond ""giving a reason"" for the return which I can't give.If you have the VHS, just burn a copy to DVD using the software now available. At least you'll then have a durable copy that is the complete movie."
2,Not as good as the original,"First off, it's actually the director's son's cut. It is not as good as the original at all. They took out 23 minutes of footage, added bad sound effects, and the video quality was lacking. They sharpened some of the picture but didnt give it a very good transfer to dvd, so can easily see a lot of bluescreen effects. Dont waste your money on this, try to get the original instead."
3,Still good but it's a shame they chopped it up..,"this film was really funny until they brought this out and attempted to make a directors cut. and he was Cut Happy. it is still a good film and worth owning if you do not have it for your collection but be warned it's about 15 minutes shorter and some of the really funny scenes were edited a bit here and there but in most part the story is intact and the whole bit with the holy man that cannot see valhalla was still amazingly funny but they did this film an injustice to re-release it in this condition. unless you are like me and absolutly have to have it, rent it first to be sure because even though now having seen what all the fuss is about I would still buy it because it's better to have an edited film then never be able to watch it again. just my humble opinion. not going to write about the story again you all know it.a 3 star effort.Buy it Here. Rent First though (see above)Erik the Viking"
4,this is a shorter version edited by the director and his son!,"great story originally written by the director for his son. Now some 15 years later, the son has grown up to help his father RE-MIX the movie to it's intended form.Great actors and settings. This is a movie for ALL AGES."
2,Ruined a great movie!,"The Editor's (son's) cut removed some wonderful scenes from the original movie. Had we known of the cuts - over 10 minutes worth, we would not have bought the movie. Hopefully the original will be issued in DVD or BluRay format."
4,"It's a long way around to get the original version, but worth it",This has both the original versions and the director's sons cut (which I played about ten minutes of out of curiosity and placed back in the case never to be disturbed again).I had to re record the DVD using a region encoding remover just so I'd have a copy of the proper film. It's terribly sad that I couldn't just purchase the original unmolested print on DVD without having to go through all this weird rigamarole.
5,It is on DVD... but there's a catch...,"This is available via DVD, however because of the MPAA and their evil pseudo-genius (reverse genius?) villiany you would have to get a DVD player that is dedicated to either the UK or German regional encodings to play it. It is available on Amazon.co.uk, and in my humble opionion, is well worth it. This film is absolutely hilagious, and is one of my favorite Tim Robbin's movies out there. Please Amazon.com. make available a list to have the manufactuerer make this title available on DVD with Region 1 encodings. It worked for Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy, you can do it again with Erik the Viking!"
1,Director's Son is an Idiot,"Ive been waiting for many years for this movie to be re-released! And although Im happy to own it, I got SO mad while watching it! I used to have most the lines memorized, so although I cannot quote the full extent of the missing footage, it BOGGLES and enrages me as to why they removed some lines. Not only that, but the moron editor even muted a scene! I dont know what issues he had with the main female character, but they must have been severe. I wish I had the director's son address so I could send him some hate mail or perhaps even some roadkill in a box.If you release a movie, and this is what the fans have come to know and love, you DONT MESS WITH IT."
1,Horrible cut of a comedy classic!,"Do yourself a favor and do not buy this DVD! This movie has been recut horribly! the edits make the movie move faster in a clumsy sloppy way. There was no need to re-edit the original, which was a fantastic movie! One of my personal favorites.I hope there will be enough bad reviews of this DVD to prompt a re-release of ETV in it's original format. Truely a bad idea on the part of Terry Jones."
1,Is there such thing as Zero stars?!?!,"Do yourself a favor and take the money you were going to spend on this movie, give it to a random stranger and have them kick you in the ""boys"". There you have just experienced what it feels like watching the Director's cut of this movie. Im no video snob by any means but it's like a child did the editing. Just HORRIBLE! Nothing like the original. Feels like you are watching the movie in fast forwad."
1,The Directors Son should not be allowed to play with daddy's toys,"I just watched this movie and feel like I have to warn lovers of the original. I echo what other said here. The Director's Son's Cut is a chopped up version of the film. As others said, let's hope and wait that we get theatrical version in the U.S."
1,Tired of the funny bits?? Here's a cut for you.,"Director Terry Jones allowed his son to do the editing for the DVD's version, and--as you see by all the 1-star reviews--the job he did was horrific. It was butchery. Key scenes and lines just tossed out. This should have been reviewed by someone at the studios. Someone who could have uttered MY scream of outrage for me, before it would have been too late.Get the old VHS. Skip the DVD. Really."
1,Not the Erik the Viking I know,"The uncut version of this film is one of my favorite movies, so I bought this DVD to replace my old VHS copy. Cutting 25 minutes from the original 104 minutes turned this movie into a cartoon. The flavor that made it magic is gone."
1,Blashemous,What the hell was the director's son thinking. So far as I have been watching it I noticed he edited out the funniest part of the movie. There is NO need for a directors cut unless you want to add footage not subtract it! We should all wrtie a letter and request the original version released.
1,A major example of bait and switch,"This book is awful. It's extremely superficial. Sills basically takes all human behavior, crams it into one of six rigid categories, and then spends the entire book describing each category, one by one, with a token bit of advice at the end of each description. She does not go into any real detail about any of them, and I found myself thinking that I could be every single one of them. This is sort of the psychologist's version of reading a horoscope. She also reads the book herself, and has obviously gone to the Overly Dramatic School of Reading. Lots of annoying drama and schtick. It's like being locked in an elevator with your overbearing Jewish aunt. Finally, she has a slight lisp, which over time, will drive you up the wall."
1,American's opinion,If you can get over the constant sneering about Americans you might like this book. American bashing wasn't needed but the author must have had a bad experience at one point in her life and couldn't get over it. Will not be reading any more of hers.
3,More milk than meat,I enjoyed listening to the audio version of this book but didn't find it to have much substance. It was entertaining and well written but not much in the way of concrete help.
2,My Big Fat Greek Bandwagon,"I thought I would read a book about a man who lost weight eating a diet of very healthy Greek food. The diet has nothing to do with Greek food. The author is Greek, so there is the connection. In a nutshell, he lost his weight by going on a liquid fast. The author is also a doctor, so he should know better than to promote fasting as a way to lose weight. Most physicians will advise you not to fast to lose weight. The author also advises you to drink diet soda. This is bad advice on several points. First being with the proliferation of diet sodas since the 1980s, the obesity rate in the US skyrocketed. Also, as a physician he should be fully aware of the dangers of aspartame. If you want to be inspired to lose weight, then you will enjoy reading this book. But don't fast to lose weight. It is simply dangerous and statistically speaking, not a successful way to lose weight over the long run."
2,not what i expected,"if there's any reason to buy this book, i'd say it would be for inspiration.i bought this book because i was amazed somebody so so fat could become so thin. i wanted to know his secret. well, i'll tell you his ""secret"" right now: he didn't eat!!! that's right, this guy didn't eat for like over 6 months. all he did was drink protein shakes made with water. wow, how simple! why didn't i think of that? all this time i'm suffering, trying to eat right and exercise my butt off, not getting anywhere and the answer's so obvious: JUST DON'T EAT, FAT PERSON. now i can see why people get gastric bypass surgery. how depressing.."
2,"author claims ""diets don't work"", yet consumed 800 calories a day for 8 months","This story has some inspiration and motivation in it for many, I am sure. But for a physician who writes--more than once--that ""diets don't work,"" then why did he undertake a DRASTIC 800-calorie-a-day-nothing-but-liquid-protein-shakes DIET to lose the weight he writes about??????And while he promises early in the book to write more about liquid protein shake diets, his very scanty page about it in the back provides no substantial information.And while bravo for him that he could take a year off work and go motoring around the country to take his mind off his self-induced drastic diet, it's certainly nothing practical the rest of us can follow.And his 7 Pillars? Written after he lost his weight, certainly not what he followed while on his drastic diet.On the plus side, reading his story does make it easy to think that if he did it, so can others."
2,Save your money if you're looking for a diet book,"This book is mildly amusing but totally unrealistic for 99.9% of the population. Save your money, I'll give you the summary of the book. Stop eating altogether, just drink protoien shakes, take the summer off from work and go to every city in the US and watch a baseball game to take your mind off how fricken hungry you and work out all the rest of the time. The guy has a great success story after losing a billion pounds but that's about it. There you go, no charge."
5,Dr.Nick- A friend in time of need,"If you have stuggled all your life with overweight as I have on and off this will be the last book you will ever need to buy.I read this book and I have been on my change of lifestyle since Jan.10th,2005 I have lost 100lbs. doing a liquid protein diet like Dr.Nick did with no solid food for almost 3 months now I feel great.Listen folks, this man knows he has been there he talks to you in this book like you are one on one with him. I would recommmend it to anyone who is overweight and doesn't know what to do or what way to turn to.This book is the creme de la creme of all diet books.You will never regret a penny spent on this book I promise you.Trust me on this one.If Dr. Nick and Ol'Bubba can do it so can you."
3,I am not a baseball fan..,"I started reading the book with enthusiasm but soon bogged down with what seemed to me to be the rather tedious descriptions of the day to day baseball games the author attended during the time frame encapsulated in the book. I applaud the author for finding what worked for him and sticking to his sabbatical journey but myself got pretty bored with the story. A baseball fan would perhaps enjoy it more than I did. There are some 'big picture' principles that are very good and transferrable to anyone seeking control over appetite but there was for me a lot to wade through to get to the 'good stuff',"
5,greek diet,the best book and the most motivating information I have ever read. very inspiring. I gave it to 5 other people to read
4,A Great Start!,This book was different than other diet books. At the beginning you get to see what he went through. Then he tells you how he lost all the weight. There were a lot of things he said that made so much sense. It certainly makes you think.
2,no good,"Did not like it, really bad acting, very slow, very poor story, and the streaming stopped twice, waste of time."
3,"Once Again, Gregory","""Victims"" is one of the last good albums recorded by Gregory in the eighties (before loss of teeth & other reputed problems took their toll); still, it is not one of his best-known. This is vintage Gregory Isaacs in a strictly lovers mood!"
5,Making sense of Welsh fairy stories.,"I started taking myths and legends more seriously when I realised that most cultures on this planet have a Noah's Flood story that is spookily similar to all the others. As those guys didn't have email or SMS then it could be that there was a world wide event in ancient times that was relayed to future ages through the art of the story teller.The Welsh Fairy Book is a collection of ancient myths and legends and if you have the kind of open mind that accepts visitors from other worlds with unusual powers, flying vehicles and time warp then there is some fun reading here.For me though, it is also a handy guide to have around when I am trying to decipher the story in the original language for my Welsh homework."
3,Great! Also... not so great.,"The book can be seen as two large sections. One is the overall purchasing, care, treatment, and history of bonsai. The second section, which comprises a large part (roughly 2/3) of the book, is a species-by-species guide to caring for your bonsai. This section is only barely useful to me, as I had already purchased my bonsai, so only two of the pages in that section were ever used. That being said, it would be perfect for someone who was deciding which type of tree to get, as it gives several pictures and good information on so many species."
5,Great for beginners,"I had this book recommended to me by people on a bonsai forum, as I am a beginner. This book has a lot of good tips and illustrations. It is lacking a little on the design section (discussing informal upright vs formal upright vs slanting... I would recommend the ""Growing Bonsai practical encyclopedia"" for help with that. This book elaborates more on different pests/diseases, and has a GREAT overview on common species and their specific care requirements. Would recommend, especially if you are unsure which tree you would like."
4,Fun stuff!,Lots of cute little images to copy and master. Even if you don't like to draw or doodle there is plenty of fun reading material and activities.
3,"Cute Baby Book, Terrible Reader - a review of ""Animal Babies""","I think someone thought a baby and toddler book would make a good primer. Yuck. Not many beginning readers, in this mom's opinion, are going to think this is a fun read.A baby beaver is a kit.A baby lion is a cub.(A baby bear is, too.)Three Stars. [C-.] Forget using it as a primer. Consider buying it as a nature book for babies and toddlers. Tom Dunnington's drawings are cute. Animals covered are: cat, dog, deer, pig, horse, cow, owl, fish, kangaroo, bunny, bird (robin), lamb, beaver, lion, bear, goat, and human."
5,Every Horror Fanatic Should Have This Book,"A superb treatise on horror as developed in all of the artistic media of Western civilization from remotest antiquity to the ""Creature Features"" of 50's and 60's TV and the Satan craze in films of the 70's. Daniels in a sense updates H.P.Lovecraft's excellent essay ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"", although he addresses film, radio programs (like ""Inner Sanctum""), psychedelic rock music, TV, and comic books with equal erudition (HPL, unfortunately, did not live long enough to witness the flowering of these media forms). The book was originally published in 1975, and I can't help but wonder if Mr.Daniels has any plans to update this remarkable work (it would be interesting to see his take on the ""slasher films"" of the 80's and the ""death metal"" scene in rock, among other subjects). All in all, a very well done survey of the manifestations of a society's anxieties via its diverse media throughout the ages."
5,A Wonderful Book,"The Power of Kabbalah speaks to readers of all religious denominations and is extremely informative, easy to read and understand. I highly recommend this and plan to purchase another copy as a gift for my Dad.Another great and highly recommended book on spirituality is ""A Course in Miracles""."
1,for people who truly want to learn,this is the 2nd book that I have purchased of this kind figuring that I had to give it another chance unfortunatly this book did not impress me at all. Laibl Wolf has a similar book and it is much easier reading and the reader will come away with much more information. Aryeh Kaplan's style is also a good . and with these authors(kaplan &wolf) u know u are getting an authors who is well versed in the material covered. from the reading of this publication I cant attest the same thing
1,This book is nonsense!,"PLEASE don't fall for this mumbo-jumbo malarky!! This is not true Kabbalah! It borders on cult belief and prays on people's fears (i.e. 9/11). Real Kabbalah doesn't do that. I bought this book and am soooo sorry! I wish I could return it. I just may burn it or throw it out, it is such garbage. I don't even want it in my house!!I don't even like the style it was written in, it's just a lot of boasting and bravado.There are so many other true Kabbalah books out there that do the subject justice, don't waste your time and money on this one! You are much better off with ""Simple Kabbalah"" by Kim Zetter or 10 Minute Kabbalah by Shoshanna Cohen. Anyone without the last name BERG!"
4,I actually read it,"It would be helpful if people actually read books for the sake of the book and an impartial review, rather than prostelytizing for a particular brand of spirtuality or religion. That said, this book is essentially to Kaballah (and by correlation Judaism) to what the Maharishi's books and TM are to Hinduism--or what TV evangelic ministers are to Christ. Or for that matter what Starbucks is to the Italian caffe. A modern, cleaned up, mass merchandised version of someone's version of the truth. No more--no less. You get out of it what you put into it. Believe it or don't. But, please don't think there is only one way to anything. So do yourself a favor and don't get hung up in labels and any one's version of ""the truth."" Learn and explore for yourself. But remember, the truth is out there."
4,Well written understanding of an ancient spiritual technology,"If you are looking for a breakdown into what Kabbalah is about, this book provides clear and precise explanations into what this faith represents. Very easy to read and the concepts are broken down into terms that even a child could understand. Highly reccommend for beginners into exploring Kabbalah."
5,This book is life changing,"An incredible book that completely changed the way I see the world. For many years I was on a spiritual quest, reading many authors, eastern religions, new age, etc. This book spoke to me more than any others I had read, and re-reading it each year, I find new insights. As we undergo spiritual growth and transformation, we should find new secrets in things we have studied before. This book is life changing and accessible to everyone."
4,it was ok,"I liked the book. But I recommend people to read about Mevlana also, they will like it more."
1,Kabbalah for Sale,"The Berg dynasty has Kabbalah books filling the shelves of every major book store's Judaica section. They claim to have ties to the Baal HaSulum, Rav Yehuda Ashlag. While it's true that Philip Berg spent a brief time studying with a disciple of Ashlag's, even married (briefly) his daughter, this disciple was not the Kabbalist to whom the wisdom of Kabbalah was passed. Rather it was to Rav Baruch Ashlag (Baal HaSulam's eldest son) that the writings (Shamati articles) were passed. Rav Baruch Ashlag passed the wisdom on to Rav Michael Laitman, the Kabbalist teacher of the Bnei Baruch World Academy of Kabbalah in Israel.[...]The Power of Kabbalah and the Berg books in general are watered down Kabbalah promising personal empowerment in this world. That is not what the wisdom of Kabbalah is about.Caveat Emptor."
4,Kabbalah,everyone should this book is a must! it has opened my mind to reality and now i know that i know.
4,"Enjoyed it, will read it again and will read more from Berg","This book is longer than others in the Technology for the Soul Series. While I enjoy the gentleness of the introductory books on Kabbalah that are easily read by anyone and share simple truths, I am curious about more of an overview on the subject. There seems to be a wide gap between these introductory books and the more academic books. I'm looking at the Complete Idiot's Guide/Laitman looks informative, but would like to see more of an overview of Kabbala from Berg."
5,Interesting!,"I have been a King Crimson fan for many years now and from following them and their varied band members over the years has spun me off to many of the players in past (and present) incarnations of that band. Trey Gunn's style of music was somewhat different from the rest of the 'Crims, and his contribution to the sound of that band always proved interesting (check out ""Three of a Perfect Pair"" from KC, or the KC DVD ""Deja Vroom""). His solo career has also proved interesting, and I have collected many (not all...yet) of his works, enjoying them all. If you enjoyed ""Live Encounter"" you will enjoy this CD."
2,"Dark, Boring, but great skill.","Well, Trey gun is a master of craft, technicly very good musician, but this suonds much like Fripp(you know, frippertronics, soundscapes, duets with adrian on Discipline), and not in a good way, in fact, it even gets quite boring at times. Track one, and the title track, seem very interesting, and obviously provide a basis, the rest is predictable, and, then the last track, well Iknew that King crimson also means Baalzebub, but this is just too much, interesting voice though, but tooo dark, even sounds pretty much evil, you know stuff that scares children, and most adults(if it doesnt make them laugh). Sorry Trey, two stars, listening to the DGM catalogue, first album sounds better."
3,King Kong Roaring Plush,"This toy states that it has chest pounding action, however, it did not do that nor are the arms hinged that would enable the pounding action. It just roared. Is there something that I am missing?Terry Morales"
4,A Must for Methodists,"Though this book has some age on it the compendium is just as good today as when it was first written. For those who do not want to read all of Wesley's thought ( 14 volumes of Works, 8 of Journals, 8 of Letters and the Notes on the Bible) this is a good book to have at hand.Burtner and Chiles are able to bring together the most important elements of Wesley's theology and present them in a manner that is very readable and understandable.This book is a good read for pastors, lay persons and scholars alike. From this book you can dip into the original writings also.J. Robert Ewbank author of ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,What is a brother?,I love this book. Ellen Hawley Gill was my third grade teacher and this book came out during our school year. I thought how cool it was that my teacher wrote a book. But reading then and now I still find it as one of my favorite children's books. I read it to my son and have read it to some of my grandchildren. It is easy to read and easy to understand. It is also easy for a young child to memorize and increase their language skills.I recommend it for learning about little brothers and for learning to read.Thanks Mrs Gill!
5,A Wonderful Childrens Book,"This is a delightful childrens book. It is written to help siblings understand their brother's a little more and learn to love them for who they are. It is very funny and has wonderful illustrations. I loved this book as a child. Read it to my children as an adult and treasure the copy I have. This book about the relationships between siblings will never be outdated. I highly recommend this book to parents, for their children."
4,Brilliant telling...no battle maps,"Howard's survey of the war and its context within the sphere of European politics before WWI is exactly what a succint war history should be--except that it is sorely lacking in maps of troop deployment and maneuvering. Considering the level of detail that Howard's text delves into in this regard, this deficiency is both surprising and disappointing. (Note that maps that feature towns and prominent geographical features are themselves present, but--trust me--you will miss having the battle maps.)Other than this weakness, I couldn't have asked for more from the book. I recommend it as the best I've seen on the subject."
1,Maps not for kindle,The maps in this kindle edition do not have the necessary resolution and are useless. Obviously a kindle book should have kindle maps.
3,"Apparently best work out, but still lacking",Have it on good authority that this is the best book available on this subject but it sorely needs battle graphics. Without the graphics you really can't get much of an image of how that battles were fought.
2,Dry as Dust,"I don't know enough about the Franco-Prussian War to criticize the research and the facts presented. But this is certainly not an enjoyable book to read. If that is a factor for you, be warned."
3,Its Okay,makes ur car have a more aggressive sound when flooring also gives exaughts more sound.... gas mileage a lil difference not to much.. Looks nice under the hood thoo
3,about the music,I really wanted to find out which cantatas a great mind has enjoyed. My first love was music. All the social structure that assumes people need an ideology to bind them in death or a dark prison like Christ in Cantata No. 4 are missing something that even Albert Schweitzer can hardly describe. This is a book about something great. Volume 1 called J. S Bach a culmination of what could be done with music within the theories that Bach had to play on way back when it had not turned into the music we now expect. I bought a complete collection of Bach organ works when that was considered unusual by the kind of people I worked with. I don't own many recordings of the cantatas. I wish I could love something without wasting all my time. Even the Eagles sang about what is on your mind has all been a wasted time.
2,Don't look here for too much advice,"This was a short, marginally enjoyable account of how a single woman served as the lead contractor and general foreman of the construction of a very small log home in the woods. Fairly well written, the author describes an uncanny series of setbacks that makes you wonder whether or not at least some of the problems were imagined. Problems with the moving trucks, architect, log producer, truck driver, every subcontractor, building inspector, insulation manufacturer, stove manufacturer and stove salesman, lawyer problems and even a problem with a delivery man who ""hit"" on her makes me think I've read a manifesto of a ""drama queen"". Not very informative from a ""how to"" perspective, there is some value in reading this from an entertainment perspective and as a guide to potential problems with the process of building your own home."
4,Wonderful Bridge Work,"...The price was right--the title catchy--the editorial comment inticing--so I bought it, and now I have to get ""The Priest"" to find out how everything got started. Ms. Traylor's writing style is similar to LaHaye and Jenkins in the Left Behind series. It is easy to follow, detailed without being tedious, and very visual. The bridge between Christianity and Judiasm is wonderfully constructed and offers totally convincing scenarios for each exciting discovery. I heartily recommend this book, especially to those who have enjoyed works by Peretti and LaHaye/Jenkins."
1,Kong the 8th wonder of the world: Electronic Kong arms,"I did not like the service I got when I bougth this product, because I ordered one set of arms, and I end up with 3 sets, 2 from the same order, wich i returned, and I got credit for only one, and as far as buying more stuff from you guys, I would think twice before doing it."

3,Very nice songs but nothing inspirational,"This album by Kim Hill was very disappointing. Although it has her rich, beautiful voice and a good backing orchestra, there is not one Christian song on it. I don't think that it should be listed under Christian music at all! I have other albums by this talented artist and I love them all, especially 'Arms of Mercy', so when I ordered this CD I expected something equally inspiring. However, it is an album that has some lovely love songs on it so if you are looking for something that is qood to listen to but contains nothing inspirational as far as Christian music is concerned then this is a good buy."
4,Great chair massage,"Being new to the industry, I bought this to help me build my techniques. I thought it was very beneficial and would recommend this DVD to anyone new in the field."
2,Fiskars Power-Lever Steel Handle Hedge Shears #9191,This product gets rust easily. It is not very strong. Need to be used for gentle use only.
3,Good but still a little flimsy.,For the price you can't go wrong. Using these shears when you need a lot of leverage will bend them near the handle. They should be used for light duty trimming. I'm happy with them after I found out that they are not heavy duty.
5,AWESOME!,My son was so excited for his birthday - and has been playing this every day since - exactly what I wanted
2,it's a mixed bag,"I was hoping for a book on wire and beading, but very little was devoted to it. I would not buy this again. If you want an intro to different jewelry techniques, especially clay, this ok ok. It is intro only, not detailed on each subject. It covers too many different types of art to give you detailed or creative ideas on your favorite."
5,It deserves 10 Stars,This is a fabulous book and worth buying. I've had several of Sherri Haab's books and by far this is one that covers so many different mediums while making it all seem doable for the crafter/artist. I liked everyone of her selections here. You will be inspired. Glad I made the purchase.
1,Nothing close to designer style jewelry,"I am extremely disappointed by this book, especially after having read raving reviews about it. This is a book for children or for someone who never beaded before. The first nineteen pages are about the basics, which are included in every single bead book. Then the book presents projects that only children would wear because they look so amateurish, naive, and infantile. I did not find a single project I would want to make or wear. There is no research in the choice of colors and the materials are cheap, made of wood, glass, paper, decorated with paint and put together with glue. There is only one simple crocheted gemstone project, which is unappealing and looks cheap. The only advantage of this book is clear pictures and explanations for each project, which unfortunately you would not even consider making anyway...I advise purchasing Margie Deeb books or Nancy Alden."
5,"""Callas IS Carmen!""","That was the advertizing slogan EMI used for this performance, and it's still true. Everything that could go technically wrong with her voice had already happened: she's wobbly on top, squawky at times, and leathery in her hcest notes. But her passion makes up for eveyr deficit. If you can stand the voice at that stage, the rewards are immense.The next best thing is that this production feels very French, not blandly international. Even the scrappy conducting under Pretre, the only man Callas would accept on the podium, feels right because it is so back street.But really it's all Callas's show. Nicolai Gedda strikes no sparks as Don Jose, and he's the best of the lot. This Carmen rises or falls depending on how you react to the lead singer, and my reaction is awe."
5,Great recording,"This is a great recording. Callas is genius in her choice of expression, and the orchestra is also wonderful. A must have for opera lovers."
1,"What's the fuss, her voice is old and tired","I much prefer the Rise Steven Carman. Callas is a soprano trying to push her mooning voice and poor frence into a role unsuitable for her. She should leave the mezzo role for far superior divas like Stevens and Horne.Again, tell me, what's the fuss???"
5,K.Teezy,Received the product in a very timely manner....I've enjoyed listening to the CD on the way into work. It helps me relax.
5,Callas does it Right!!!,"This is the perfect ""Carmen"". Callas has discovered the truth about the character. Carmen is NOT sexy! She is a gypsy and a fatalist, hence the powerful card scene. Whatever is in the cards must be dealt with and cannot be avoided, even though it be death. Also Carmen is the flame and we are all the moths. We must be careful not to get to close, or we get burned. Those who have seen the footage of Callas singing the ""Habanera"" will remember the body language that says, ""Don't touch!"" This is the secret of Carmen. Callas' interpretation is much closer to Merrimee than to Bizet. This is the real Carmen, RARELY seen or heard on today's operatic stage. The real tragedy is that Callas never put this opera on the stage."
2,So So,Sometimes it does' work and you have to reboot.Does not work with firefox.Does not work with anything but Internet Explorer.I like Microsofts a lot better but it wont work with 64 bit.Guess I'm stuck with this generic reader.I wished it work with Microsoft Money.
2,Software upgrades aren't free,This works great. Until a new version of Firefox comes out. Then you need a new Firefox extension to make the fingerprint reader work. Does UPEK provide this for free? Nope: they make you pay. So keep in mind that UPEK treats purchasers of this product as a continuing revenue stream.
5,Eikon Digital Privacy Manager Fingerprint Reader likes 64-bit!,"I needed a good fingerprint reader for my new computer with Vista as my present Microsoft fingerprint reader is not compatable with Vista 64-bit. I researched several fingerprint readers and bought the Eikon Digital Privacy Manager USB Fingerprint Reader as it likes the Vista 64-bit! And it has several features that I liked. I have not had any problems with it. Both my wife and I can use the reader after programming her fingers along with mine. So, I have a ""backup"" person that can use it when I am not available. Jim"
1,Another wast of money!,"Wish I could return it, it's still in its box. Tried to hook it up once, didn't like it and never used it."
3,Eikon not an Icon.,"I bought this product thinking I would be entering some cool new era of personal computer security. I was wrong. Instead of security, I ended up with a product not really designed for anything other than logging into windows. Oh it has other software features, though non of them are worth mention. The password manager is the silliest and most misleading part of this package. Suffice it to say that it is easier to type in your email address and password than it is to try to log in via the Eikon. See, you cannot visit a website to login and use your Eikon. Instead youre supposed to scan your finger, then choose the website from a list of stored sites. Now if the Eikon actually read your scan each time and reacted as advertised, then this might not be so annoying. However, the item does not work as advertised and often you will find yourself running your finger over the scanner 3-4 times before it even responds. A momumental waste of my hard earned money."
3,"Pay to work with Firefox, won't do RDP","The product is attractive, and does a nice job of logging me into my domain account when I'm sitting at the machine. Offers to remember, and does, passwords entered in IE8. Nice.However, the latest Firefox requires a software update from Upek -- and you can't have one! Not unless you (re)-buy the fingerprint management software directly from them! Otherwise, you're stuck with the 1000-builds-ago version on the CD you get in the package. That seems unique in my rather extensive experience. The software is fifteen bucks as I write this.In addition, I have a huge number of remote logins via RDP. The software does not recognize an RDP login window, so I'm out of luck there."
4,Good,"Device works, looks great. Has some issues with php pages though.. so some login pages like godaddy don't store properly, other than that, works great"
3,"nice, but has some bugs..","Item is practical, however, it contains some bugs. For example, you need to adjust the speed of your swipe so that the sensor ""reads"" your print correctly. More often than not, I found myself swiping my finger over 5 times, adjusting my speed every time, in order for the sensor to read it.And, just recently, somehow, my websites are no longer working with the fingerprint reader. They were working fine, but now don't. I might need to go back and register the sites with the reader.It's a nice alternative to the whole password thing... however, prepare for some issues."
4,Cool product,"Arrived quickly, packaged well, as described.I have tried 3 different MFGs of bio readers now and this one works with the most applications.I only gave it a 4 because their support is very sub standard.Good Seller, Good Product - Both Recommended."
4,Easy to setup and use,The Eikon fingerprint reader is easy to install and use. I bought it to use with vista 64 bit. My old MS reader doesn't have drivers for 64 bit windows.This works great on my system.One problem is it won't log in on Roboformbecause it is not a windows log.So far it works on every thing else.
2,typical math book,"very few examples to learn the art of math from .....a book that the teacher must be able to teach math from the ""chalk board"" to show the theory or the student will never learn pre algebra ..... the book does have problems for review and thus a good take home book for homework assignments ,but teacher should / will be able to teach subject before assigning any homework."
3,Interesting but biased,"Senator Dudley is a long revered figure in the study of Acadian/Cajun genealogy and this book is a must if you are interested in or having Acadian/Cajun roots like me. It is interesting to have a book which describes the activities of a group of one's ancestors. I even have connections to the Leblanc line like many others and am one of the author's many distant cousins. However, Leblanc has strong feelings about the subject of the Deportation so if you are looking for a decent history of the events of this time, this book is not to be taken literally. The British point of view is not given any form of objective treatment. It also is dated naturally enough and has errors in it, some not the author's fault. One concerned my Roger line which descends from the Caissy/Caissie/Quessy line which he didn't know about. Overall, not a bad deal for the price, but be prepared to receive a less than pristine copy since it has been out of print for many years."
3,"Good darts, good price","I bought these darts because the ones that came with the Halex board were really cheap. I have since moved on to an affordable set of tungsten darts which (I checked, but Amazon doesn't sell them anymore. They were Halex and were about $30)For the price, the darts fly better than expected. The only weird thing is that the package does say the darts contain lead. It's nice that they tell us, but its a pain because you have to wash your hands after using, if you don't forget."
3,okay to start with,"only problem i have run in to is the plastic shaft does't hold the flights to well but the metal shaft works good. if your a begining this is a great place to start, comes with two sets of flights and flight protectors. i use them for friends at the house."
3,"Decent, but could be improved...","The darts are very nice looking. There are two shaft colors/designs, and two sets/colors of flights. The flights detach very easily during play, which is somewhat annoying. Otherwise, a good product, for the price."
3,Alright For the Price,"These seem to be alright for the price, I will write back if I find otherwise after using them for a bit."
1,Horrible textbook.,"This has to be the worst textbook I have ever used in my life. Terms are not in bold, there are no review questions, and the authors do not provide footnotes with there sources. The book is impossible to Outline or even take notes on since it follows no coherent structure. Sometimes it will talk about the consequences of things, before it discuss's there causes. It also has numerous historical mistakes. Our teacher points them out every class, but some even I cna see on my own.The book filled with typos. It says that nationalism challenged neo-platonism. I think it means nominalism. Please do not use this as a main textbook for the course. You students will not do well."
3,Not my book,"This book isn't for me but since it helps others maybe I'm just out of the loop.Please Michael next time when writing a book leave out sentences like, ""I am Michael Sharp"". Yeah, we know, we already bought your book. I'm sure you have some great things to share but they won't come across if you add this in. The continual ""I"" and ""Me"" were not enlightening at all. This is basic knowledge. Jesus knew it was about God and all of us so let us both try to follow his lead. I made myself read almost all but left it on an airplane. I'm sure someone else liked it better.I'd just like to add that there is no fast track to enlightenment."
1,Not another book on chakra activation!,"Just what we need, another book on chakra activation. If you are interested in ascending your life force energy, there are far more comprehensive and spiritual books out there from the masters that you can read. This book is poorly written, not to mention it covers stuff that has already been covered a million times."
5,Best Show Ever,"""The L Word"" is like ""Sex in the City"" with better characters and a much higher IQ. The girls are glam, but hey, it's TV. Plenty of social issues and real dilemmas are addressed to make up for all the girls looking like they walked out of ""Vogue"" (and forgot to eat for a few weeks).However, if you're homophobic it's not the show for you. You might want to stick to ""Full House"" or something equally bland as not to upset your fragile sensibilities."
5,A great package - Well worth adding to your collection,"I didnt really get into the whole L word thing at first until i happened to watch an episode midway through season two. As I watched more and more episodes I began to realise that I wanted to be lesbian... Anyway... to cut a long story short I left my boyfriend and now am in a stable lesbian relationship. and I love it!I recommend this for all women as something that as well as being an extremely entertaining show, will open your horizons and help you realise who you could be."
3,Disappointed,"The item was not for me. I have never seen this program. Looks interesting and fun, but i was not very happy paying 16.08 in custom charges, when it was not made clear to me. If i would have known i wouldn't of got it. I didn't get it from the UK site because you don't sell it.That said nothing damaged worked fine and the person was pleased."
4,A shining example of Shaw's art of musical criticism,"About twenty years ago, the BBC World Service introduced me to readings from G. B. Shaw's musical criticisms. The readings showed me that critique is as much an art as the subject of the critique. This pamphlet is a shining example of Shaw's art of criticism. Shaw presents the story, he gives some musical analysis, but most of all he presents the ""Ring"" in a philosophical and politcal slant that only Shaw could do. I suspect that the philosophy and politics are more Shaw's than Wagner's. Great for thosw who like Wagner and G.B.Shaw. Good for someone new to Der Ring des Nibelungen."
3,Don't waste your money.,"A large portion of the book is taken up in plot synopsis of the Ring Cycle. You can get that right here on the Internet.Another large portion is taken up in relating the plot of the Ring Cycle to political events in Wagner's own lifetime and Shaw's own lifetime. Nothing new here. Just glance at the today's newspaper and you will see that today's leaders are as greedy and corrupt and any of the parties which were fighting over the Rhine gold.Instead of all this, I very naturally expected this book to be about--well, music! In the last few pages, Shaw finally does discuss Wagner's music. If you already know that Wagner's operas are not chopped up into arias and recitatives, and if you already know that Verdi's early operas abound with waltz accompaniments and Wagner's operas do not, then you might already know most of what Shaw tells us.According to the publisher's notes, Shaw worked as a music critic before he worked as a playwright. I think I like him better as a playwright."
2,Not helpful for everyone,"This book is an invaluable aid to those who feel forgiveness is their best way to find healing, or for those whose personal beliefs demand this, but it's too simplistic to work for every trauma victim. Some victims find the pressure and insistence to forgive their tormentors to be an additional burden, or an addition to their pain, or an insult to their suffering. Therapy must be tailored to the individual and this method just doesn't work for everyone."
5,Just what HE had in mind,"This is an awesome book. R.T. Kendall goes beyond just forgiveness here. He shows us how God not only wants us to forgive, but to take it to the next level which is to bless those we have forgiven. He provides insight to why we may be holding grudges and understanding to why some people have difficulty in forgiving and how we can handle it. I definitely will re-read this one over and over."
5,2nd best book I've ever read.,"I can't praise this book highly enough. This is not an easy book to read. Kendall warns that it is harder than climbing Mount Everest than to forgive, but it is so worth it.This book recaptures some of the power that utterly transformed the brutal roman world some 2,000 years ago. If your spiritual life is tied up in knots, this book will point you to the power than can liberate beyond what you can imagine."
5,Excellent Resource,"It's so hard to forgive! This book gives you the guidelines to do just that though. Even if you cannot mend the relationship, you can forgive. Forgiveness is for you, not for the other person. It cleanses your soul and let's you move on to be happy and healthy. Excellent resource along with the workbook."
3,Not a big fan of R.T.Kendall,"This book is good, but his writing is somewhat dry even tho he is a very interesting and devoted minister. I would recommend Joyce Meyer's book on ""Do Yourself a favor and forgive"" but this one is good too."
5,Child proofing must,So important helps protect mobile babies so they don't hurt themselves. Nicely priced and easy to install product. Would buy again
2,Pointless,Kind of a pointless product. Once you wind up the cord it has to stay wound up. I thought I would unwind to close at night and then wind up during the day which is not the case. I guess I don't see why you would spend money when all you have to do is tie the cord.
2,Pops apart too easily for me,"I do like how these Wind-Ups hold the cord up out of baby's reach. However, I move my shades up and down throughout the day, and the Wind-Ups couldn't take it for long. Within a few days they were popping off every time I pulled the shade cord. I gave up and now I just loop the cord around the window lock to keep it out of reach instead."
1,Terrible,Don't bother buying these unless you plan to keep your shades open permanently. They are nearly impossible to wind up as instructed and doing this daily is unrealistic. I wasted my money. blah
1,Useless,"This could possibly be the most useless product I have ever purchased. Can't get it to work as the cord bunches up on itself inside the roll. Even if I could get it to work, it would be much easier to just put the cord on top of the blind when it is raised up instead of trying to spin the excess manually. In fact, that's what I'll have to do."
1,Do Not Buy,"These do not work well at all, and I would recommend that you do not purchase them. When you wind up the cords, they pop apart."
2,Not really worth it...,"These don't really work for us. I don't know if we just aren't using them right. But if we want to wrap the cord up and still be able to pull the shades up or down, we have to redo them and undo them every time. Just not worth it. They also don't hold enough of the cord once the shades are up."
3,Not for me,"I consider myself handy and I know I put this thing together right, but... as others have said; it comes apart if pulled on too hard.I like to open my blinds all the way, and have to put the cord winders up pretty high for them to be out of reach. This means I have to take them off each time I want to put the blinds down. Kind of a pain, even though they are very easy to install.It's possible, most people have windows set higher than mine. In that case, these may be perfect.Guess I should have researched a bit more before buying.Not a terrible product, just not right for my house."
1,Window Cord Wind-Ups are dangerous for children!,"Length:: 4:51 MinsWindow Cord Wind Ups are used by many people to keep cords out of reach of children. We reviewed this product and wanted to show you how fast children can access these Wind Up devices. Parents for Window Blind Safety does NOT recommended these in homes. Children can easily reach them! We have heard many child proofing services are recommending these as a child proofing devices. While they might be good for babies, once a child is old enough to climb, they are no longer safe. The safest thing you can do to ""Child Proof"" your home is to take all of the window coverings with cords out of your home and replace them with cordless products. Please see our website for more information."
1,Falls apart when you touch it.,"This is a horrible blind cord winder. I would give it 0 stars if possible. Every time I tried to open the blinds, it fell apart if I touched the cord wind up. Don't bother with these. Get the Kidco Blindwinder instead. It ratchets the cord up and is easy to open your window up while the Blindwinder is still on the cord."
1,Works best if you don't use it,"True, I don't know why this is even marketed as a child safety product. We however got to make it hard for the cats to get to it. Wind up is a un-necessarily hard as it's designed to stop itself from being wound up. And to let it down you might as well just open it and let the cord fall out...cause it eventually does anyways if you manually try to unwind it.-zero stars (they really need to make zero an option)"
1,waste of money,"If you open the blinds by holding the cord wind up then it is fine, if you tug on the cord it falls apart. They are far from worth buying."
2,wind up,When I bought the product I was under the impression (mistakenly) that this somehow winds up and down (maybe with a spring or something). The product clears up any tangled cords by storing them in the little white container. However I found the term wind up (assuming it also winds down) misleading. It is almost impossible to 'wind down' or for that matter wind up without opening it and redoing the winding. As mentioned it does an ample job of getting some of the long cords out of the way.
4,Helpful Book with Some Tweaking,"I found this book to be helpful with some tweaking. She mentions that the child should take their long nap in the morning and the short one in the afternoon; I did just the opposite and my 7 month old twins are AWESOME sleepers. They take a 45-55 minute nap in the morning, 2-2.5 hour nap in the afternoon and sleep from 7:30/8pm till 9/9:30am every night! Also, they are exclusively breastfed so I never gave them boiled water since they were hydrated enough from the nursing. Very helpful pointers though overall. If I can schedule and get twin boys to sleep this well, then anyone can!!!"
5,Changed everything!,"This book improved my life dramatically. After making a billion mistakes with our first child, who didn't sleep through the night until he was three, I found this book and changed the way I did everything. I didn't need the baby basics chapters but the rest of it is worth it. Yes, you might want to tweak some things. But her ideas for getting the baby on a schedule (maybe obvious to some but not to me!), getting him/her to settle and sleep all night, were priceless. My six month old is a champion sleeper and I can't recommend this book highly enough."
1,I Beg Your Pardon,"I am one of the contributors to this volume. I agree with Mr. Scott about the excellence of Mr. Krick's essay. Of course, Mr. Scott is a renowned historian and an acknowledged expert on R.E. Lee and his campaigns, so I guess I must apologize for putting him to sleep. My bad. I'll use shorter words next time."
1,One excellent essay; forget the rest,"The essay by Robert E. L. Krick on Lee's staff is excellent. Too bad, because it is contained in a volume with very god-awful other essays. If you can inter-library loan this, then do it and read Krick's essay; the rest is nonsensical drivel from others incapable of analyzing anything more involved than a stop sign."
3,it's ok,"from the precious reviews about this piece, i can see most of the classical music fan is not generous to each other. especially, previous reviewer from seattle should be shame on himself. i respect your opinion but your way of criticising other reviewers are despicable. i also see you are using the different email to review the same piece. if you like this one so much that you cannot accept other work, shut up and just listen! in my opinion, this Don Giovanni has some respectable aspect especially if you think Don Giovanni is a comedy. if you think this is more like a serious play, then don't try. Karajsn should be the one in this case."
2,"Good acting, good technique, poor voices...","Unfortunately for these singers, at least in this recording, good voices are required for good opera. Although Taddei (Leporello) and Schwarzkopf (Donna Elvira) have voices and expressive talent, the rest of the cast falls short. Giovanni's light baritone is ill-suited for the role, Masetto is run-of-the-mill, and Il Commendatore sounds like an extremely old man speaking his part on pitch. For your money, there are other CDs to buy."
3,average conducting (boring tempo) with excellent singers,"Ok, most people, if not all, like this piece. i am not disagreeing that this one is good piece but past reviews are too overvalued. the biggest reason that makes this piece to be avobe average quality is due to all-star singers which was the achievement of producer (the husband of schwarzkopf). besides singers, i don't think this piece is just average one. if you are looking for the best Don Giovanni, go for Karajan's one. if you want an italian conductor, should try muti. if you doubt my word, try listening overture of these three conductors. you'll understand."
2,Go for the highlights version,"Unless you are a diehard total opera fanatic, I recommend the highlights version of this Giulini version. The singers are superb, the sound is great for the period, the orchestra is great - but. Two discs worth of recititavo for less than one discs worth of really beautiful arias and duets, etc. simply isn't worth the price. Calling this the greatest opera is a stretch - must be a Mozart lover. Bellini's Norma and Donizetti's Lucia with either Sutherland (where she has much more extensive parts to display her lovely, incomprehensible voice) or Callas are far better, along with many Verdi works. Don Giovanni is a massive work, but melodious content is a small part of it. Good story - some great singing - all of it on the highlights disc."
