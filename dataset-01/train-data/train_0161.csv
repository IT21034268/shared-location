3,Great Reminder,"This movie is a great reminder of what is important in your life. Dean Cain plays a father whose work is priority one. His life is shaken when his son goes missing under his supervision. Okay acting, little plot, great message."
2,the way home,the actors in this movie were not good and the movie was just too much of the same throughout the movie. Film making was poor quality.
4,Worth the watching,"I received this DVD from Thomas Nelson to review.Dean Cain stars in this Christian film about a family that loses their two year old son. It's a very gripping story that is appropriate for all family members. It may be a little scary for sensitive little ones not old enough to understand the premise. There are lots of scenes of folks crying and one character in a flashback is killed, though nothing graphic is shown.I disliked the mother's character. The family was supposed to be Christian, and yet she spoke rudely to her husband and had usurped his place as head of the household. She was critical, demeaning, bossy and overbearing. I used that as a teaching tool to explain to my daughters how ugly a selfish spirit is and warned my sons to watch out for a woman like that.I loved that it is a true story and they showed pictures of the real people during the credits and included interviews with them in the special features. I will be glad to recommend this film to others."
3,So-So,The publisher has provided me with a complimentary copy of this DVD through Booksneeze.The Way Home is a family film about a family who's young son goes missing and how the members of the community come together to form a rescue team.This is based on a true story and the minute the rescue team started I knew who was going to find it. To be honest it was a rather long and drawn out boring movie. But with made for tv family movies that often is the case.
2,The Way Home movie review,This movie is not my kind of movie at all and I thought it was very boring . I didn't like the story and I thought the acting wasn't all that great either. It did have the look and feel of a tv movie. Maybe if you are into this spiritual types of movie you might like it but personally it just wasn't all that good.
1,"Terrible! (And, I'm a legit Christian who had high hopes.)","I've gotten a number of good, Christian, family-values movies and generally love them. Reviews on this made me think it would be the same, and I had high hopes since this had Dean Cain in it. Unfortunately, it was a horribly boring moving with essentially no real plot. Terrible, terrible movie."
3,Pretty good.,I liked that this was a true story and had a happy ending. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was a made for tv movie. It had a lot of suspense and good storyline.
3,inspirational story,"The Way Home is an inspirational movie that we enjoyed watching recently. It is a gut-wrenching true story about a family whose 2-year-old little boy disappeared, and how neighbors, friends, and even strangers, gathered to help with the search. It seemed somewhat predictable, but there were unexpected twists as well. What I especially appreciated was that it was clean, family-oriented, and faith-based. Those elements are somewhat rare in movies these days. (I received a review copy from BookSneeze.)"
4,The Way Home by Dean Cain,This movie was well done with great sensitivity. It was based on a true story which I always appreciate. It really touched my heart.
2,Review for The Way Home,"This movie shows the importance of keeping family priorities straight. The movie is clean and shows nothing controversial or ungodly. However, it is very slow moving in it's story line, and I found myself questioning 'When are we going to get on with the plot?' I would rate this movie as acceptable for all ages but if I had seen it before I bought it, I would not have purchased it. This is NOT to say it's a bad movie because it's not. I just wish there had been more to the story."
4,A Nice Introduction to Polynesian Religion,"While this book was aimed at the New Age audiance, it is an excellent introduction to classical Polynesian shamanism in Hawaii. There is alot of information on the lunar calendar, the various deities, holy places and objects, symbolism, the Menehune and other important aspects of Hawaiian spirituality. I strongly recommend that anyone with an interest in Hawaiian religion or Huna look at this book."
5,Sharing the Magick,"Reading this book you will come to know the love that Scott Cunningham has for Hawaii: the land, its people, and its magick. Through his writing you not only learn about the spirituality and practices, but of the heart and beauty of Hawaii. Scott also speaks of his relations with the Goddess Pele, and his other experiences in the land. Another must for Cunningham fans, or those who wish wishing to explore the magick of the islands."
5,The Two Covenants,This is perhaps the best book in my library for opening the eyes of believers to the truths of the New Covenant.
3,Mixed Feelings about the Grill Box,"I have mixed feelings about the Grill Box. It does cook good if you allow it to get hot but it seems cheaply built and the lid does not fit correctly (watch the guy in the first review video readjust the lid). After a few uses the black finish (Porcelain?) on the ""Defuser"" started to crack.Don't even think of putting wood chips under the grill as was suggested, even after soaking the chips in water by the time the grill was ready to cook on the wood chips started burning"
5,Happy with this BBQ.,Worth the money. Would recommend to anyone with the camp chef setup. Like all the camp chef equipment. Very good product.
3,Runs Small,"My son adores his new batman costume. It doesn't look overly durable, but what costume is? It runs on the small side though. I have a petite 3 1/2 year old who has just moved into a 3T for length. This costume hits about 2"" above his ankles. With black socks and shoes it will be fine, but it is a bit on the short side. It fits him overall quite well, but if your child is on the heavy side, you may want to re-think this size. My son easily fits into an 18 month size waist wise and this costume, fits him perfectly, without a lot of excess room."
4,Good for the price,"The sizes seem to run a little small, but my two year old loved being Batman. The felt face mask was not his favorite, but he tends to have a little bit larger head so it was tight on him.Thin fabric, expect it to wear fairly quickly. Good mobility for the kid though, and easily fits over warm clothes. Cape is velcro attached and short enough to not trip on or get tangled in. Overall, a good buy for a batman fan."
3,it'll do..,"This is a pretty cute costume, though the headpiece is pretty small and not particularly comfy. My son is 21 months old and it fits him perfect, I can't imagine it fitting a 3 year old very well. I paid just over 20 dollars for this including shipping and in all actuality it isn't worth $15. Needless to say my son likes it so I'm not complaining..."
4,Great Costume!,"This costume fit my 3 year old son nicely. My only complaint is that the eye holes in the mask were too small. They were very close to my sons eyes and his lashes kept sweeping the edges of eye holes. I cut them a bit larger but he still wouldn't wear the mask pulled over his face. Before going out I used face paint to frame his eyes like a mask. It worked well, but later he decided to wear the actual mask with the face portion scrunched up on top of his head. It was just as cute that way. I took another reviewer's advice and used black socks just in case the suit was a little short. It was right at his ankles, so I wouldn't try it on a tall 3 year old. Mine wears a 3T. Over all, the bat suit was great and came with everything pictured. Some dark colored sneakers made it complete. Totally worth the price!"
2,"It's OK, but runs small.","When I received the costume it looked as I expected and thought we were going to be happy. But when we put it on my son, it was too small. The mask didn't fit at all over his head and the neck was WAY too small to close. So we just decided not to close the back (which was going to be covered by the cape anyway) and not wear the mask. But then my son complained that it was too itchy (I was surprised, because it seems like it would be soft). So for Halloween he wore it long enough for me to take a couple of pictures (without the mask) and that was it."
3,bound to get laughs.,"The Green Monster Toilet Prank is a fun, one time Prank that is bound to get laughs. Can only be used a few times on one person but if you live in a dorm, might have a better shot. Be sure to put some lemon juice on it to give it a ""slimely"" look."
3,Objects in mirror are smaller than they appear,"My initial intentions were for these suction cups to be replacement cups for some that had stoppe sticking. Based on the description and selection of sizes, I decided these would be my best option. However, these are absolutely tiny. Even the ones that are labeled medium and large are really really small...like nickel sized, at most. It was pretty dissapointing. They do suction ok, but their size is a major downfall."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"it's the old story of when you assume .....! I looked at the pictured items and assumed there would be at least one large suction cup. WRONG More than half way down the page, it says 4 medium and 6 small."
4,"Great music, poor package","The song selection and singing is glorious--the whole concept is ""Joni Genius."" But the music is the message--don't pay extra for the special edition! The ""lithographs"" are no better than postcards, the box is hard to get into and hard to store, and I had to exchange three CDs before I found one not damaged by the silly CD holder that won't ""hold""!"
4,Fun and danceable Arab Pop,"I enjoy listening and dancing to this CD. I love Nancy's voice and her music is a lot of fun. If you prefer pure traditional Arab music, don't buy this - it's definitely pop music. If you enjoy modern music with an Arab flavour, this is well worth a listen. Belly dancers please note - the songs are eminently danceable."
5,nancy Ajram rocks!,Nancy Ajram is an awsome singer! she has a great voice that is smooth. her songs have great beats and the way she sings them is perfect! i think egpytions have the best voices and the best music and beats. they can do amazing things with their voices and know how to use them. they have real singing voices!if u like Egpytion pop this is a great singer!
4,I Love Her Voice,I became acquainted with Nancy Ajram's music when I began studying middle eastern dance. I will probably never perform to any of it as it is Arabic pop and that doesn't interest me for dance but I will continue to buy her CD's because I just love her music that much. The CD does come with a pamphlet that includes translations for the music for those (like me) who don't speak the language. There are also sites online where you can find line for line translations if that is what you want.Listen to her music and decide for yourself if you like it. I certainly do.Why 4 stars instead of 5? Because I actually like herYa Tabtab Wa DallaaandYa Salam - Shabet Shaabit(a CD of Childrens music) even more.
5,Cheer up your day,What better tonic after a long day than to put your feet up and listen to the sweet voice of Nancy Ajram on this CD. All the tracks are cheerful and have an infectious rhythm. I wish we would make more space on Western airwaves for this kind of popular music. It would make a refreshing change.
5,Kick Ass - Must Read,This book has very important guidelines to excel in college - and in a reader-friendly format. It's a timeless resource - one I'd expect to see 'on the shelves' for years. My kids will definitely read it before they head for college.
2,"Nice story, to bad the author did not use spell check.","I did enjoy the story, and was glad I only spent $.99 on the book, as the author did not proof read the story nor did he run a spell check to catch the many many misspelling and typographical errors. These errors really are a distraction, and I found them take away from the telling of the story."
2,Could have been better,"I wanted this book for the story line. The story line was interesting about revenge and even had a small subplot in which a man and wife are able to resolve their issues after several years. The story line itself was enjoyable, but the typos in this book detracted from the story. I found myself continuously fixing the typos in my mind as I was reading this book, and even had to re-read a section because the characters were confused (as to who was doing and saying what) at one point. I was able to get through this book, but was left severely disappointed with it. Had this book been edited, I think I would have truly enjoyed it."
1,"Really, really not a good design book","There's not a single picture in color and there lies the rub: it's very hard to understand pattern or texture without color. Only specifically black and white patterns are useable but the vast majority of photos should show rich vibrant color. This book is virtually unusable and therefore, worthless."
1,"Really, really not a good design book","This review is of the 1982 paper back version of the 1968 hard cover book. I've included in Images above a few of the pictures. There's not a single picture in color and there lies the rub: it's very hard to apply pattern or texture without color. Only specifically black and white patterns are useable but the vast majority of photos would show rich vibrant color. Look at the final image above: those directions for color are part of the book, not mine. Pretty much a waste of time."
4,Works Wonders,"Great for colds and infections. It does work. I have tried a stronger brand in the past. I need to use 3 of these when I am really sick, compared to 2 of the other, but the price difference makes it worth it."
4,No 2 in heaven,"This is the follow up to the album that turned Sparks into a disco act; The No 1 in heaven. As it's predecessor it's produced by Giorgio Moroder, but this time aided, and I think, almost solely produced by Harold Faltermeyer. (Yes, that's the guy with the ""Fletch"" hit.) It is not as good as No 1, but it still spawned a no 1 hit in France, the dreamy ""When I'm with you"". This and ""Young girls"" beeing the standout tracks."
2,Weak,"This is among Sparks weakest albums by any measure. The fact it is the follow-up to a brilliant monster of a record (No. 1 in Heaven) makes it seem all the worse. When I'm With You was deservedly a smash hit in Europe, but there is precious little else worthy of anyone's time here. If you happen to be in the process of building a Sparks catalog, this should be among your very last acquisitions."
1,It is not made of wood. Very flimsy.,This cabinet is made of a very cheap version of particle board covered by thin paper veneer. It is a total piece of junk. The shelves are not designed to take mixed media. I would not recommend this cabinet to my worst enemy.
5,love it,I got this item and packed it full of my pc games and am very pleased with it. I only wish it was even twice as wide or a little wider and taller.It's sturdy and i love the glass door and the fact that they are not transparent and aren't too thick or thin.
2,Pirates?,"There are 4 movies on this DVD. Only one is a pirate movie in the sense that most of us think of them. That one is The Black Pirate, which is in black and white and is a silent film (with a rather annoying accompaniment). There are some great ""pirate"" scenes in this movie. Jamaica Inn is a really good movie, but it deals with ""wreckers"" (people who lure ships aground) and not pirates on the sea. Captain Calamity and Wallaby Jim are 'way too modern to be considered pirate movies. I was quite disappointed with this purchase. I gave it a rating of 2 because I really enjoyed watching Jamaica Inn (it was Maureen O'Hara's debut movie alongside a great cast)."
3,Glad to hear this isn't her best work,"Having read rave reviews of Penman's historical fiction, I picked up this book for a buck just to sample her work. I was disappointed and hoping that the two longer historical novels of hers that I've bought live up to their glowing reviews. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the wonderful medieval mysteries by Ariana Franklin, but I found this one a little lame. The main character, Justin de Quincy, seemed mildly charming and affable; maybe an Ashton Kutcher could play him in the movie. But I found it annoying that there were two separate story lines -- Justin's investigation of the murder of a poor Welsh girl and his mission as the Eleanor of Aquitane's ""the Queen's man"" -- with no real connection between the two. I'm no historian, but I did not get the feeling of authenticity of dialogue and speech patterns that I love in Franklin's novels. Maybe American writers just can't pull this off."
2,This is not the Penman quality I've come to expect.,"The first novel I read of Sharon Kay Penman took me less than a week to complete. It was well over a thousand pages and I had finals in graduate school, but I couldn't put it down. Cruel of the Grave is not the same caliber of book. Penman's gift of developing characters and a storyline that readers feel intimately involved with is not established in this text. I have read all of her historical novels. After reading each novel I anxiously waited for the next to be published. Penman's talent clearly lies within her ability to write amazing medieval novels, not medieval mysteries."
5,Fun Medieval mysteries!,"Not sure why some of the reviews were so critical. These were not meant to be the epic,long novels that she has written previously. I think stretching herself into mystery writing while keeping it in the same time period was an admirable move. They are rich with detail and Justin de Quincy is completely out of her imagination. I personally adore the character and I like these books. More light reading when you need a break from the large volumes of historical fiction I usually read."
4,Cruel as the Grave required reading for a 9th grader,"My son has finished the book and told me that it was a really great story! He enjoyed the story, did not have to be bugged to keep reading and loved the ending. I was suprised since this was a required book by his school for summer reading so read it!"
1,Pass this one by,"If you love Sharon Kay Penman from her great historical novels such as Sunne in Splendor (as I do), don't expect the same quality out of this shlock book of medieval mystery. Her characters are bland and uninteresting, the treatment of the real medieval world seems less real than even the best fantasy novels out there, and the plot is not grabbing at all. I think she is trying to capitalize on the Cadfael craze by cranking out (easy-to-write) mystery novels that don't take nearly the effort or research that her historical novels do. If you want to read a GREAT book, do yourself a favor and pass this one by in favor of Sunne in Splendor."
3,Meh,"I had high hopes for this album. I'm always looking for chilling/relaxing music. There is no question Sudha has a wonderful voice. Glorious actually. I really do like it, but the music itself does nothing for me. I find it too distracting for background music, but not good enough for direct serious listening."
5,beautiful,I have listened to this over and over again from the library. I am going to have to get my own copy. The chanting is wonderful.
5,"smooth, sexy, and relaxing","After listening to the first Mushroom Jazz, getting the 2nd volume in the series was a no brainer. I would say the mixing is a lot better in this set, but doesn't beat the overall quality of the first one. What is fascinating about Farina is his mixes do not sound dated and they are timeless in my opinion. A lot of the mainstream electronic music sounds ghetto when you listen to it years later, but Farina's style is fresh and there isn't the slightest hint of aging to his musical compositions. Also don't make the mistake of importing this set to your computer in separate tracks like I did. It totally ruined the continuity of the mix and the pauses in between tracks can be a serious mood killer. It took me almost a year to warm up to Farina's work and once it clicked there was no turning back."
4,solid!!,"if u dig laid back, funky hip-hop/acid jazz hybrids (and who doesn't), this is the CD u've been looking for! farina's got some dope mixing skills that keep the CD bumpin' at all times. wether u're into groovin', coolin' out, or just bumpin' some sounds in the ride, mush jazz II delivers a fresh vibe."
3,Smooth Yes...Tiresome Yes,"A lot of high praise for this second installment of Farina's infamous Mushroom Jazz series. I agree with all the notions that it is very smooth, but Mushroom Jazz, Vol. 2 is at best, an average compilation overall. There are not any dreadful tracks but on the other hand, the album features only mediocre acid jazz tracks.A very novel and interesting choice on how Farina choses to mix this compilation, but all its high praise stops there for me. A nice album to fall asleep to or for winding down, but there are much better downtempo acid jazz albums out there that feature much more interesting tracks.3/5 stars"
3,Chicago Nights,"I have been a great fan and admirer of Mark Farina since my days and many unforgettable nights in Chicago, where I was first introduced to his genius. His love of jazz and and beats that translate to a an otherworldly language are inimitable, yet I am of the opinion that Mushroom Jazz I is far better experience. Please, seek out the original. It is sublime."
2,sooo repetitive!!,"just got this CD in today and popped it in ready for a good experience.what i got was a repetitive beat ear beating!maybe i am not sure what to look for but its basically sounds like someone took a beat machine and experimented on it.this is the second time i've been burnt by OM Music/Naked Music.I am starting to see that around 2003 or 2004 Naked Music made a turn towards a sound I like. Pre 2003 does not do it for me.As I write this, I am listening to track 2...........repetitive. there is no creativity.i hate i wasted my money."
3,Not as exciting as advertized.,"The description piqued my interest in this video, but it was probably more for people who do this sort of thing for a living. It's OK, but for me at least, it wasn't as interesting as it was cracked up to be."
3,"Nice Film, Good Messages...a Bit Long","""The Safety of Objects"" has a great ensemble cast set in a suburban neighborhood where all the neighbors clearly share some history. Rose Troche, the Writer/Director, builds an intricate web of relationships all centered on an event that happened in the past. As the story unfolds, we learn about this event through a series of flashbacks that slowly build on the depth of the characters in interesting and surprising ways.One of the funniest and most creative elements is a love affair between a young boy and his sister's Barbie-like doll.I liked this film, but it does drag a bit at times and borrows a too heavily from other films, including: ""Hands on a Hard Body"" (1998) and ""American Beauty"" (1999). With some editing, I would have given it 4 stars."
3,Kristen Stewart's first role,"This is Kristen's first role. She plays a tomboy (she looks similar to her Panic Room role), dresses like one, acts like one, looks like one. Kristen's career started with a high note, in this movie she looks so natural, could it be because she plays a kid and was actually a kid? As they say never act in a movie with kids or pets, they steal the show! Loved Kristen in this film.The movie in itself is another story. The plot is all over the place, the scenes are jumpy and the book is much better than the screenplay. The acting is very good actually, Glenn Close and Patricia Clarkson are powerhouses no matter the roles they portray. Josh Jackson is in a coma during the film, it could have easily been Pacey in the bed there!, ha."
3,Living Features,"A movie is of provincial America, where four neighbouring families struggle to live while tackling day-by-day routine problems, sexual, behavioural and emotional.Sometimes it's hard to comprehend what is what-just sit and watch if nothing to watch different happened."
1,A Confused Mess!!!,"Large ensemble pieces like this take a great deal of directing skill, ala Robert Altman, that this filmmaker obviously did not have. The movement between stories of three different families and several individuals was awkward at best and completely muddled at worst. I also found myself not caring about these people, who struck me as uninteresting, unbelievable and unengaging. In addition, most of the actors, with the exception of the often wonderful Patricia Clarkson, either overacted or felt like cardboard cutouts of their characters. This was an abyssmally bad and silly film that should have gone straight to video with a warning on its cover that read ""For less than mature audiences only."""
2,To confused to get emotional,"Im a sucker when it comes to emotionality in films and will often get teary during movies: Big Fish, Seabiscuit, etc. This movie was so confusing that instead of getting emotionally involved with any of the characters I found myself concentrating more on trying to figure out what was happening in the story. I felt that there were two really interesting parts in the movie, one where a young boy holds conversations with his sisters barbie doll but finds out that a real girl is much better and another scene where a young girl gets abducted. Overall not a very well done movie which was disappointing for me since there are some excellent actors in the movie. The book was probably much better since it didnt need to be condensed into such a short time frame."
5,Alex:The Life of a Child is a book sure to make you think.,"I am a healthy 17 year old, and I picked up this book at a garage sale, and oh, how it's changed my life. Alex was an extraordinary little girl, and she's a prime example of what real courage and pure love is. I've read the book several times, and I feel for the whole family. Not only did it make me realize how lucky I am to be healthy, but it also proved how heartless and sad our world is becoming. Alex, at the innocent age of 8, knowing she was dying from CF, still maintained the courage and hope few people in this world (even HEALTHY people) seem to possess. She was a remarkable little girl, and I look forward to meeting her in heaven. It is impossible to read this book and feel as if you haven't changed. I hope someday I grow up to become the young woman Alex would have been. I also am dying to see the movie, but I can't find it anywhere!! Can someone PLLLLLEEEEAAAASE help me?!END"
5,heartbreaking and unforgettable,I read this book years ago and have never forgotten the tremendous impact it had on me. Deford captures both the unimaginable loss of his little girl and the joy she nonetheless brought his family and experienced in her short life.
5,excelant and touching,"i bought this book because my best friend also had lost her life struggling with cf at the young age of 19.i always knew what cf was but never new how life threating it really was.this book was touching and reminded me of my memories with phylicia (1986-2005) she lived life in such a fullfilling way.she qouted in her year book her senior yr of high school one year before she passed ""living life as if you are dying is never acually living at all"".this book was very touching and i hope other people get a chance to read this book also."
5,Alex's story is one of sadness,I have read this book many times and have cryed over it. I would recomend it to ANYONE. I have got my friends to read it and they also enjoyed it
5,Touching and Inspiring,"Frank Deford lovingly recounts the brief life of his precious daughter, Alex as she battles Cystic Fibrosis. Not only is this a loving biography of a child, it gives a perspective of what it is like to have a child with special medical needs, who ultimately dies. It isn't just the patient who must deal with the disease, but the whole family. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who either know a family who has a special needs child or who works with children in any capacity."
5,I cried my eyes out ...,"This book is so poignient, I must have cried at each and every chapter. Frank DeFord does a beautiful job paying tribute to his late daughter and conveying the struggle that cystic fibrosis put his family through. Along with explaining all of the technical aspects of the disease, he really opens up and tells readers exactly what it is like to have and live with a dying child. Throughout his book, I almost felt as though I were right there next to him, sharing his grief and anguish over his charming daughter's illness. This book reaffirmed my belief that childhood diseases must be cured - Alex was a special child who would have grown and done marvelous things in her life had she not been born with a deadly genetic disease. In my opinion, Frank DeFord's book is the finest ever written on cystic fibrosis."
5,What a studly book.,Alex makes you realize what life and death really are. I am 15 and this book is probably the best I have ever read.
4,A Painful and Very Truthful Read,"I think every parent's nightmare is to lose a child, but Frank Deford points out what it would be like if Alex had never been a part of their lives. What a beautiful child with an ugly disease. This is not a tear-jerker you will actually grieve the Defords, as they watch Alex fade away painfully, but leave them with important joy, gifts and unshakable memories along the way. It is an important book to read."
5,Deeply touching & inspirational,"This is sincerely the most memorable book I have ever read. I first read this book after seeing the television movie, 17 years ago! I was only eleven at the time, maybe that is why I was so touched. I wasn't much older than Alex had been and could relate to her at some level. Mr. Deford did an excellent job at presenting his daughters life, not just her illness. Alex was more full of joy and life than most adults are. She is truley an inspiration person who deserves to be immortalized, and this book does just that. Anyone who reads this will be deeply touched. Have a box of Kleenex handy!"
4,Absolute Beginners Revisited,I first read Absolute Beginners whilst living in the next suburb in London in the 60's so could relate to the events in the book. I really enjoyed reading this novel again.And can recommend this author for a well written story.
1,Not what I expected.,"I thought I was ordering an audio book. Instead it was a cd by a rock group with the same title. I opened it so cannot return it, but it will end up in the garbage. I should have looked before I opened it."
4,Words can't describe Tom T. Halls songwriting ability,"Tom T. Hall finally recieves the recognition that he richly deserves as one of Nashville's finest songwriters. Tom T. Hall has always written about and for the common man. From the lovestruck wanderer in Kelly Willis ""That's How I Got To Memphis"" to Iris Dement lamenting on ""I Miss Alot Of Trains"". Much of the artists success on this album goes to their ability to reach down and communicate the pain and isolation that Tom T. Hall often wrote from. However only one or two interpretations on this CD left me somewhat confused. Joe Henry's ""Homecoming"" sounded like an angry bitter man. And Ron Sexsmith's ""Ships Go Out"" sounds lost and distant. In conclusion I dare any listener to hear Richard Buckner's ""When Love Is Gone"" and not be reminded of a dumped relationship or a love gone bad."
4,Songs on CD,"If your really into T.T.H., you'll find some refreshing covers of his songs. Some not so, but you can always skip those. Overall, this is a more folksie side of T.T.Hall."
4,A favorite for years,"My wife bought this CD for me years ago and it has been a wonderful old friend. Like many of the other reviewers I really like Kelly Willis singing ""thats how i got to memphis"". The only thing I would really add is that I thought Mary Cutrufello singing ""Candy in the Window"" was supreme as it was slightly different than Toms version, but beautifully evocative and yes....real."
4,Jansport backpack,"I bought the bag for my daughter & she loves it. She says it is spacioud enough for her things, which are mostly art things & is practical, too, for travelling.What I like about Amazon is the fast shipping & delivery. Keep it up! I recently bought a Fracas eau de parfum for myself - price was very reasonable & it was shipped to me fast, just ahead of time for a party."
3,Copy protection problem,"Living in the states, i had only vaguely heard of helen shapiro till a few years ago. Since i liked the few songs i had heard, i purchased the EMI CD. I agree with the other reviewers that it is an excellent buy with a great selection of her songs. However, i did not notice that the Amazon description says ""copy protected"". The CD case itself says ""on some equipment, for example car CD players, playback problems may be encountered"". They're not kidding! While the CD plays perfectly on my 12-year old Yamaha CD carousel player, it won't play at all on my new (2006) Panasonic CD/DVD player - not a note! It is the only CD i have found so far that the Panasonic won't play. Don't know about the car player - i haven't tried it. Beware!"
2,memories revisited,"as a child, I remember Helen Shapiro's songs from listening to them on the car radio on the way to school. At the age I was, buying 45's was not even on my radar.I identified with 'Don't treat me like a child'. The upbeat rhythm of 'Walking back to happiness' and for some reason, 'Tell me what he said' for I was too young to have a boyfriend stuck with me.Along with artists like Neil Sedaka, Cliff Richard, Paul Evans, finding this album [dating myself again]and playing the songs for me and my siblings evoked conversation and warm fuzzies of happier simpler times. Granted, she was a lesser known British pop star from that era, but in our lives, she struck a chord of pleasant memories."
2,i wish they lastest longer,SORRY BUT I ONLY GAVE 2 STARS. I GOT EVERYTHING RIGHT B/4 OUR 9 DAY VACATION. SO DURING THAT TIME I COULD NOT RECHARGE. EVERY DAY I HAD TO PUT IN NEW BATTERIES! I WISH THEY LASTEST ALOT LONGER
3,"After 15 years, they had come back to Bartlett College...","Sentimental Journey by Kathleen EagleThey'd been the kind of couple everyone thought would last forever - but they hadn't. Now Keeley was back, and Dominic was still in town - and the magic they'd always shared was still there. Maybe this time...Loving Abby by Marilyn PappanoAbby always took care of everyone but herself. Joshua remembered that from the days when he was her professor. Now it was time to teach her to reach for her own happiness - and for him.Over The Rainbow by Patricia Gardner EvansWhen an injured cat brought Bess Hillard to veterinarian Will Shedd's door, he hated to let her go. But she was going to be in the area for a week, and a lot could happen in seven days..."
5,Great shoes,"Bought these for our 15yr old son at the beginning of High Soccer season. Best soccer shoes he's ever owned. Made it thru August, Sept and Oct with either 2 hours of games or practices at least 5 days per week with minimal wear. The insoles were the first to go, however, he's still playing in the shoes over the winter because they are more comfortable than the Diadoras he wanted to try next. The shoes come with leather conditioner - we used it about every two weeks plus we kept cedar shoe trees inside the shoes when not in use. Some other brands may be a few ounces lighter, but I doubt you'll be as happy with them."
2,Title v. Rambling Content,"The book rambles a lot. The subject inside has nothing to do with the title. I was pulled in by false advertizing on that alone. I felt like I was invited to an old country estate and left outside to look in the windows. The interesting vignettes are far and few between, and the reader never really gets to know the characters well. I don't know the author, presumably who is the center point of the book. There are better books that discuss the decline in religious life, or chronicle individuals who have lived out their vocations.Perhaps ""The Calling"" will be a better read for someone else."
2,No part sufficient for a whole to develop,"The overall sense I received from this work is that Catherine Whitney is more interested in speaking of herself (without so much as answering the question of why she suddenly shifted from would-be religious Sister to unbelieving radical feminist). The anecdotal information about several Sisters in the earlier chapters seems a promise of real development later, but this promise remains unfulfilled.Half stories, some of which seem flavoured by stereotypes and prejudiced assumptions, are profoundly unsatisfying, particularly since the natural presumption to which the early chapters would lead was that depth, development, and understanding of the various Sisters' situations would follow. It did not happen. There is a sampling of moments from various Sisters' lives (not, as the sub-title implies, a chronicle of a year in the life of an Order), but no insight into anything."
1,Was she really called?,"I find it hard to believe that the author was ever ""almost"" a nun. This rambling memoir gives no insight into the vocation, and is blantantly wrong on a serious matter of theology, e.g. The Immaculate Conception. This church dogma refers to Mary being born with without original--immaculate at HER conception. It does NOT mean ""she was not defiled in the process"" of conceiving Jesus! This is a basic tenet of the Roman Catholic church, and one that jumps out at a reader with a background of religious education."
2,"No part developed sufficiently for a ""whole"" to emerge","The overall sense I received from this work is that Catherine Whitney is more interested in speaking of herself (without so much as answering the question of why she suddenly shifted from would-be religious Sister to unbelieving radical feminist). The anecdotal information about several Sisters in the earlier chapters seems a promise of real development later, but this promise remains unfulfilled.Half stories, some of which seem flavoured by stereotypes and prejudiced assumptions, are profoundly unsatisfying, particularly since the natural presumption to which the early chapters would lead was that depth, development, and understanding of the various Sisters' situations would follow."
4,"Misleading title, great book","While the subtitle of this book is incredibly misleading (this book in no way chronicles a year in the life of an order of nun, but rather a lot of different years for different nuns in one order....), I found that the author captured the mysticism of spiritual calling and the sense of sacred place at the center of religious orders. She exposed her own misgivings and feelings very clearly and chronicled (nicely) her own spiritual quest."
3,Awkward mish-mash,"If you are expecting this book to tell what motivates sisters, what they do, and how they have adapted in the post Vatican II world I would suggest you read Poverty Chastity & Change by Carole Garibaldi Rogers instead. I find this book by Catherine Whitney awkwardly arranged and the content ""lite"" - a mish-mash of memoir and local history."
2,"interesting, but anecdotal, without a bibliography, and with some startling mistakes","This book is a mishmash, and is poorly named, particularly the subtitle (maybe the publisher chose it?). It's interesting and heartfelt, and obviously the author cares a great deal for the subject. But it wanders back and forth.She makes some errors that would be astonishingly easy to have corrected.As someone else pointed out, the Immaculate Conception is Mary being born without the taint of original sin, not Jesus's birth. That's the Virgin Birth.The word ""discalced"" does not mean anything ""literally"" about poverty. It means ""shoeless.""The correct name of the high school in Seattle is not ""Blanchette"" but ""Blanchet.""She has no bibliography and cites no sources for her information.Interesting and heart-felt, but not a work of scholarship, which is a pity."
3,Even the title is misleading; focus is on the author herself,"I was almost through the book when I realized the author really thought she was writing about calling (newfangled version of ""vocation"") in a general way. She or her editor just didn't get it done. Little cries about a ""different"" sort of book - just go where it leads you, etc., can't defend jumping around from anecdote to anecdote and then measuring EVERYTHING by herself and her shutdown life. All that glory and all she can do is go over and over how she was ""rejected."" I really enjoyed the stories of the nuns, though. Staying or leaving, they gave us glimpses of women of depth and wonder. I've never been a Roman Catholic but I'm a Christian. I'm glad I read this and in the words of people lots younger than old me, the author needs to ""get a life."""
3,An enjoyable easy read.,"As a former Sister, I found the book to be very accurate and descriptive of the life I once knew, particularly as it relates to the 60's and 70's.Catholics and non catholics alike will find the glimpses into the lives of Sisters de-mystifying.Not for those with extensive indepth knowledge or religious life.How any reviewer could possibly refer to this book as trash is beyond my comprehension. The negative reviews on Amazon show a jealousy or a sour grapes attitude. Perhaps they were written by women who were rejected by religious communities."
5,"A refreshing, sensitive portrayal of modern Nuns","This book evoked a number of emotions as I read it. There were times I laughed aloud, remembering my own Catholic school days. Many times books of this type resort to veiled ""nun bashing"". We tend to focus on Sister Matilda, the drill sergeant, who rapped our knuckles with the ruler! Ms Whitney, however, portrays these Nuns as real, human women who are continually growing and rededicating themselves. Though their numbers are fewer at this time, they are reaching out to others in more diverse ways. Many of the women who left the Convent seem to still have a bond with the Nuns. This speaks well for Religious life! The author's own spiritual journey, woven throughout the story, was thought provoking and touching. I found her characters, as well as the message of the book ,very believable."
2,Cute but small,"The costume is really cute but the size isn't true. I am a size 10-12 depending on the product and I ordered a Large which is 12-14 and I couldn't even get it past my arm pits, it seemed more of a size 9-10 than a 12-14. It also comes with a headband (with no feather) which I didn't think it did but it is really big and I would need to take it in an inch or so to make it fit."
1,Halloween,Unfortunately I was unable to use this item because when I originally placed the order it did not got through. When I tried again they no longer carried the size I wanted. I went w/ a different size & unfortunately it did not fix. I had to send it back.
4,Great!,This is a great Christmas CD that everyone can enjoy! The Fab Four are even better in concert.
5,"Great Christmas Tunes with a Beatles ""twist""",This music is great fun! It brings a twist to traditional Christmas music. Nice for the Beatles lover and Christmas music lover in the house.
3,Love Fab Four - But,"I love the Fab Four and have seen them many times live in Disneyland and other venues. The never cease to entertain and amaze with their talent, but this album is not what I expected. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but not so much that I could listen to it as much as say Sinatra or Mannheim. It is Beatle songs with holiday lyrics. Cute, but no what I wanted. I wanted to hear those great Beatle voice singing real Christmas songs.Good try boys, but it did not hit the mark for me."
5,FAB FOUR IS FAB,This CD is a must for Beatle Fans. Very clever with the Christmas music mixing into the Beatle music.. Its Genius.
3,OK but it's been done before,"The Fab Four are following in the footsteps of Rubber Band who put out BEATMAS,a collection of Christmas tunes done in the style of various Beatle songs,in 1996,some six years before the Fab Four's efforts.Rubber Band also did a better job of it-their ""No Reply"" version of ""Feliz Navidad"" easily trumps the ""And I Love Her"" version here.Some of the singing here is really annoying,particularly the bogus Ringo's over-the-top Liverpool accent.That being said,there are many enjoyable numbers here and the band parodies some lesser known but fine songs like ""Tomorrow Never Knows"".So you could do worse but you could do better,too."
1,I think it sucks !!!!,The Beatles just butcher classic Christmas songs . I just don't like it . Sorry I'm a Beatles fan too !!!!!!!
1,Less than one star,"I bought this based on the many 5 star reviews but if there was an option for less than one star I'd use it. I bought this for my teenage daughter who is a Beatles fanatic but we both laughed and cringed all the way through this and most likely will never listen to it again....it was horrible. It is good, however, as comic relief....."
2,Forgot to mention,"In my trashing review of The Fab Four's Christmas cd, I forgot to mention that the band, as far as the billions of Beatle boy bands out there go, IS actually quite good. Just wanted to point that out.My review of the Christmas cd remains the same. It does indeed blow and is just way too silly to be taken seriously. Perhaps this band should use their talent and write their own material and lose the Beatle alter-egos entirely!The World would be a much better place with a few less bands from Southern California trying to speak Liverpudlian, wearing bad wigs and performing songs from 1966 in Sgt. Pepper suits.Just my opinion of course.Peace,Ritchie P."
2,It Sounds Familiar,"I purchased this CD in Riverside, California.I like the music, but it sounds like familiar sections from Ottmar Liebert, novamenco, Jesse Cook, and others.This CD consists of parts of other artist's music.He did a good job. But I'd rather listen to the originals."
5,Ishtar of Alabina,"The first time I heard Ishtar's voice it was like I was struck by some kind of spell. I was brought up listening to Salsa music and I cant exactly remember where I found Alabina, but I never forgot the name. I cannot say that everyone that listens to this will like it, but without a shadow of a doubt this woman-Ishtar has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. Goosebumps appear just remembering her voice in ""abibi a nour el ein."" Forgive any mispellings of this title"
3,order a size or two bigger,"haha Im in the proccess to try to return this helmet. Word of advise for the new buyers, if you do order, order at least a size bigger then your normal helmet size.. this thing wont even fit my head..im thinking two sizes if i were to reorder. but im returning because it is not as slick of a look at it looks on picture,like two inches of padding on each side of the head lol looks like a mushroom."
3,German DOT Helmet,"In theory XXL size (that's what the label says)but really small, like a European L."
4,Mostly entertaining,"Helmet is great, but a little large due to the padding. Kinda goofy looking, but totally hilarious. Definitely recommend based on price."
3,Needs more padding,"I'm bald, and without any natural cushion of my own, this helmet as is out of the box hurt the top of my head and I had to alter it a bit by adding some extra cushioning. Fellow baldies be warned.Also, it is quite a bit larger than I thought it would be. The comparison to Darth Vader is apt. It's not bad, but it is a little thick and sits higher on my head than I wanted it to. Maybe some more modification is in order..."
3,"OK, but definitely has some flaws","Got this helmet because I wanted something low profile and that looked cool and that it does. I've used a couple of other helmets so I do have a bit of comparison. It does look cool but that's really about as far as it goes.Here's what I don't really like1. The chin strap feels like it's a little bit too far back and when tightened all the way feels like it choking you.2. The left side is definitely lower than the right side.3. Anything under 40 mph is fine but as soon as you get some speed the front rim really catches a draft and will continually pull of your head. Even with the strap tightened to the point of un-comfort.In general, it's great for short rides around the city but I definitely don't recommend extended rides with this helmet."
5,Perfect present,"This matt german style helmet is for my daughters xmas gift to go with the new bike and sidecar she swapped the Harley for. Cannot fault Jafrum is any way, they sent 2 helmets by mistake and to save me the trouble of returning extra helmet they gave it her as a goodwill xmas gift.... what other firm would do this. I shall recommend the to all I know for the excellent products ans service, thanks again Jafrum"
5,very happy,"this helmet is exactly what i was looking for. the sizing is spot on too. the shipping was quick also. this helmet doesnt give you that special ed look. fits very well and looks cool. im pretty picky but, cannot find any faults w this helmet. very much worth the price in my opinion."
4,"Very pleased, sits low & snug, FAST shipping","Exactly that WWII look I was looking for, looks great on my Bobber, MANY compliments every time worn. Due to reviews, ordered a size LARGE (Iam usually a womens medium) as I prefer my helmets to sit low on forehead 2 avoid that dumb ""mushroom head"" look. Glad I did, large fits great w/baseball cap under. Straps are nice & thick (standard padded pleather), but 90 degree angle is a tad uncomfortable when strapped tight (understandable)."
1,Chinese Crap,"I am sorry, but a company with a name like Iron Horse should not be selling crap from China. This exact helmet can be found by street vendors, vendors at motorcycle shows, etc. Not too many good products come out of China and this is one that doesn't make the list. Vendors who sell these pay less than $10 a piece for them in bulk. This isn't an ""Iron Horse"" product."
5,Great Value,"Great product, great price. Seems like good quality. True to size. Looks cool. Bought two, one for myself and one for my wife. We are both satisfied, and we thought the price was just right"
1,Too big,"This thing is HUGE!!! If thats what you're looking for then here it is, but if you're looking for the coolness of a german army helmet this is not it!"
1,It's a special helmet,My boyfriend order this helmet despite reading the many horrible reviews about it. When he tried it on he looked like he belonged on the special bus. People please don't ignore these reviews unless you like the retard look.
1,meathead mongoloid,"get this helmet if you want to look like a meathead mongoloid its hillarious,its a novelty helmet to hang up some-where not to wear"
1,runs small order 3 sizes too big,"My husband wears XL , reviews said it runs small so I ordered a XXL, it fit like a large, sets very high on head, runs very small. Wasted a lot of money on shipping."
2,Its HUGGGEEEEEE,"Multiply your head by minimum 2.5 and that is the final look you will be having.German helmets are supposed to look classic and mean but this makes you look like a soccer mum wanting to be bad !The helmet comes in great finish and look really good on a desk, not on your head though. much larger looking than the original Harley Davidson Helmets."
1,Big and dumb looking too!,This helmet looks like it was an ode to space balls. Wow it is dumb. I hate it and will never wear it unless I want to look like a huge poser.
1,I hate this helmet,This is the most stupid looking helmet. It sits high on your head. All of the posts about this thing looking like the Spaceballs helmet are true. Do not buy! I am returning mine.
3,smh!,The helmet looks nice ..but they run really small.I had to send mine back. All of the protection inside of the helmet takes up a lot of space. Did they not account for that when they call it a particular size.. Smh!!
5,Great fit; just order one size larger than usual!,"The fit is fantastic and doesn't give you the ""Mushroom Head Look"". Very comfortable! The only thing missing is a snap to hold the extra strap from flapping in the wind. This is just a minor issue as they do have a band that holds it down pretty well."
3,Nice but too much foam,"The helmet is nice but there is too much foam lining which makes the helmet sit really high on your head.....so, if you like the darth vader look this helmet is for you"
4,Helmet,Nice product came in a timely fashion and was as described.Good fit and finish it was better than I expected
5,Item was even better than expected,"I ordered this item as a present for my husband. He loves the look of the German helmet, but we couldn't find any locally that were DOT certified. I found this online and ordered it. This item arrived 3 days earlier than promised, and it looks so good! My husband loves it! It has the look he wants, with the protection I wanted. The inside padding isn't so thick that he feels like it looks stupid. Thank you."
4,A good place to start in search of Foetus,"This recording is a compilation of some of the better Foetus songs to date. The tunes are compiled from previous albums and singles, bringing together songs from about ten previous releases (some no longer available), as well as several new releases. It was originally a double album, so the price is very good for approximately 80 minutes of music. A good portion of the album (~25%) is instrumental."
4,The best car manuals available,"I've used the other major car repair manuals (Chilton & Clymer) and none of them hold a candle to Haynes. Every step of every task is spelled out exactly and in a logical fashion, and differences by year are noted clearly. Photos of procedures are often supplemented by drawings to better illustrate the parts when the photos don't show the necessary detail. Most of what I learned about fixing cars I've learned from Haynes manuals. I've had five other Haynes manuals before getting this one, and never looked back. Gentlemen prefer Haynes!"
2,Not enough detail,"Don't count on finding out how to remove spark plugs #1, #2 or #3; it doesn't have enough details and only shows how to take the easiest one out (#4); you don't need a book for that. I guess you get what you pay for! :-)"
3,Not bad,this book is a good book for people who love to fix there cars and also for people who are in love with the VW Beetle.
5,terrific all-inclusive guide to most fun places to be,I loved spending time learning in detail how to enjoy some of what appear to be the most fun events happening in the US. Now I know where I will plan to go to have a great time!
1,Do not waste your money,"Although the website does not offer this information, please note that this book refers to specific events in 1999 and 2000. While this book may have been informative in 1999 per the other reviewer's remarks, do not waste your time and money in 2002."
3,Great space opera. Goes well with beer and chips.,"Dominick Flandry is a 30th Century Horatio Hornblower. This is space opera, plain and simple. But it is very very high quality and readable space opera, and Poul Anderson really does put some effort into speculating about what human society will evolve into, and what alien races will be like. These stories are entertainment. Flandry is extremely likable, and so are the Merseians, the alien bad guys. (They are more or less a cross between the Klingons (whom they predate) and an iguana.)These short stories are meant to be fun and are that. This is not deep meaningful literature. More like what you'll want to read while drinking beer and eating chips. Hey, nothing wrong with that! What's not to like? If you can find it, buy it!"
4,Solid Train Video,"This one was done right. This series is a bit inconsistent (the polar express is really bland) and others are good but the production was a bit hasty and seemed not so well planned.However this London to Venice video was very well done. The scenery was solid. The train interior and the shots of the cities travelled to were good. And the clips of Venice were overwhelmingly beautiful, a few were better than I'd even seen in non-train films. This one is a must have for train buffs.Because people don't know of this series, it gets short shrift. The competitor ""Travel The World By Train"" series is way more consistent and better organized on average, but the price of the other series is way, way higher. In this series, even if one gets an average or not-so-hot one, it's only a few bucks. The other series is prohibitively expensive and sometimes not always available.This video was one of the best values in train-oriented multimedia I've yet encountered."
5,Text missing? Check this website,"I sometimes see the comments in Amazon CD reviews that the Lieder texts are not included with a CD. There is a handy website that I have found that is amazingly thorough in providing the original texts, often with translations in English, French, Italian or other languages. The site is free, but encourages readers to help contribute to the cost of maintaining it.[...]I have not heard this CD, but give it 5 stars for its selection of songs.If anyone knows where to find MP3 downloads of recordings Zemlinsky Lieder based on poems by Stefan George, please let me know."
3,Buy another van Dyk album first,"""Seven Ways"" & ""Out there and back"" both are more consistently good than ""45 RPM"" & if you've never bought a Paul van Dyk album before, buy one of those two first. ""45 RPM"" has grown on me with repeated plays, but it's not my favorite in the genre & I doubt I'll ever play it as much as I've played ""Seven Ways"" or a couple of Paul Oakenfold CDs. ""For an Angel"" gets all the attention, but my favorite track is six, ""Emergency!"" which I'll happily play over & over. Not a bad album, but there are others I'd buy first."
3,for an angel,"the 7 ways cd was the first pvd album i had ever purchased... but when i heard ""for an angel"", that instantly became my favorite song so i ran out and bought 45 rpm. this cd is one of my least favorite of pvd's. although ""for an angel"" is probably the most beautiful song ever known to trance, the rest of the album lacks the energy and powerful flow of beats that exists in ""for an angel"". i do not regret buying this album, all new trance listeners should eventually get this cd, but i'd suggest getting out there and back, or seven ways before 45 rpm."
4,it was good specialy the song angle,"its better for people who like listening to techno not for dance music. his song angle is good for dance but every thing else is in the line of trance. Get greece 2000, three drive on a vinyle is the best song ever"
5,great review,Paul is one of the greatest dj's ive heard. his work amazes me. so pumpping with heavy bass and fast beats. it rocks!!!!!!!!1
4,brilliant,Paul Van Dike mixes some of the best music I have ever heard. I just sit in utter amazement at his brilliance.
1,Techno music in the 90s = Disco in the 70s,Techno music will fade as with all extreme forms of popular music
4,Not bad for his early works,"I own pretty much everything with PvD's name on it. I have every single 12"" vinyl of his as well. Anywhooooo, this is one of the few that will not recieve a 5 out of 5 because there are some songs on this CD that I can't even dance to. Then again, there are songs like ""For an Angel"", ""45rpm"", ""Spannung (Tension)"", ""Emergency!"", ""Rushin' (Revolutions Per Minute)"", ""A Magical Moment"", and ""For an Angel (PvD's E-Werk Club Mix)"" that stand out as the best ones on here. I would recommend getting this first if you don't have any of his other stuff so that you can see or hear how he has evolved through the years."
1,"Again, I requested to see DVD's and instead was delivered a used book instead of a DVD","Please stop mixing books with DVD's when the request to SEE DVDs is what is requested. NOT BOOKS, I was so mad when I recieved a BOOK when I had requested to SEE DVD's for sale."
5,Charles Dickens Nicholas Nickleby,The book that I ordered came pretty pretty quick and in very good condition. I was very happy with my order from Amazon. I would very much recommend shopping on Amazon!
4,The Dickensian world,"I would say this is ""David Copperfield""'s B-side. It is a typical Dickensian book: the life of the Nickleby family from the death of the father until they are rich and happy. One of the most important parts of the book is the study of the horrible boarding schools of Yorkshire, where Nicholas is sent. We can read the dirty intrigues of Uncle Ralph, the adventures of Nicholas and Smikes as travelling actors (a world Dickens came to know very well), the kindness of the brethren Cheeryble.Definitely, this is not one of Dickens's best novels, but nevertheless it is fun to read. The characters are good to sanctity or bad to abjection. The managing of the plot is masterful and the dramatic effects wonderful. It includes, as usual with Dickens, an acute criticism of social vices of his time (and ours): greed, corruption, the bad state of education. In spite of everything, this is a novel very much worth reading, since it leaves the reader a good aftertaste: to humanism, to goodness."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"When I decided to read Nicholas Nickleby I was told by others to read greater novels to enjoy the Charles Dickens experience such as David Copperfield, Bleak House, or Our Mutual Friend. While I was nearly convinced to read these (I haven't yet but I will) I stuck to my decision and I have to say I am glad I did. This novel was one of the greatest reading experiences I have ever had. I loved each and every page and I can see why people wrote that they did not want it to end. This novel was only my second Dickens book after The Pickwick Papers. I have sense enjoyed Great Expectations, A Christmas Carol, and Oliver Twist. For those who are loathe to read such a long novel I can assure you that once you really get into Nicholas Nickleby the pages will fly as you read. The same was true for the other Charles Dickens novels I read. I am a real fan now and I look forward to David Copperfield next!"
4,Flamboyant performance by resourceful young novelist,"Again and again I had the sense of a young writer reveling in his powers -- his creation of a teeming multitude of characters and their antics and adventures, his magical use of classic rhetorical tropes (such as metonymy, irony of various types, etc.), his ringing of many emotional notes. One feels that Dickens must have been amazed and delighted by his own profuse gifts. I'd hope that many people would read this book while they themselves are young!As has been said by someone before, I believe, one doesn't learn much that is new from Dickens, but one encounters a prodigious range of events and persons that relate to the universal experiences of human life -- of being bullied or being a bully, of being too trusting or not trusting enough, of having to resolve conflicting duties, and much more.I started reading Dickens about 25 years ago & only recently got to this one, and found it even better than I expected it to be."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I usually love a Dickens novel. This one is so choppy and boring that I may not even finish reading it. As a reading teacher, that goes against everything I believe about literature."
5,brilliant!,"The reader of this particular production, Robert Whitfield, is genius. He totally made this story come alive. It's long (25 CDs), but it's worth it. I listened to it on my commute to work for three months, and I'm going to miss it now that it's over. If you're a fan of Charles Dickens at all, this is one of his best."
5,Nicholas Nickleby. Jus an all around heart warming story.,It's a great story and one that anyone would enjoy. Great for young people to see that perseverance pays off in the end.
5,Charles Dickens always makes me laugh,"I love this book for the sarcastic and ironic comments on various characters' personalities, actions, etc. The story is great and I enjoyed it until the end!"
3,Nicholas Nickleby,"It is a great story just a slow read. Although I prefer the 2002 movie version better than the actual book, which is rare. I almost always prefer the book to the movie."
3,Good but long,This is long. Anyone who completes it should get some kind of credit. Indeed Dickens creates these wonderful caricatures of the human soul in the different characters of the story. Each is like an individual portrait. But the portraits are part of a narrative. There is the battle between good and evil. And I feared that evil would have the upper hand. Dickens is good.
2,What the what the,"From an historical perspective this book might have some merit, but judging by contemporary standards it is not to be recommended: The characters are simple, either unconditionably good or bad, and the title character is just dull. The latter is depicted as a hero, but really does nothing heroic, ie: beats up two considerably older men and gets away scot free; gets bailed out of a hopeless situation by the lynch pin inexpicably suddenly dying; and his love for a woman is based entirely on her looks. His poverty and misery occupies maybe only a quarter of the book as he again gets luckily saved by these two do-gooder brothers. Finally, this book is satirical and I hate satire.This is 950 pages of tedium."
4,This is one of the most marvellous books I have ever read!,It suspenses the readers page by page and I would recommend it for all ages.
3,Same old Dickens story.,"Standard Dickens tale of the sufferings of a poor boy, who becomes rich. I did like his character Sir Mulberry Hawk, a great name."
5,Love the book!,The service was great. I Would definitely buy from them again! Product was exactly as advertised. Highly recommend this seller.
4,An older but still valuable resource on 2 Corinthians,"Victor Paul Furnish's commentary on 2 Corinthians is helpful in providing an overall frame for addressing the letter and there are some real gems in this commentary. The length of this commentary and its age prevent it from being readily accesible for many users, but it is still a valuable resource on this often neglected letter."
4,Rest Mat Supreme,I bought 2 of these for my boys to start Preschool. The 2 year olds seam has ripped on one side and it was only used for 2 months -- 2 days a week before it pulled and now it isn't usable. The school has referred me to next time buy a different kind that this could be dangerous after it ripped.
4,Very good dvd quality,I cannot remember if this dvd arrived on time or not; but the quality of this dvd is very good. I would recommend buying this dvd from this vendor.
4,A fascinating and utterly unique book,"I hate to disagree with the New York Times, but I found this book to be utterly fascinating. It is a remarkable mix of history, archeology, and even biology. Pellegrino brings the night of the sinking to life in a remarkable way."
3,The Ghosts were somewhat lost,I was interested in the author's perspective of the individuals and their accounts on the Titanic. The relevance of the discoveries at the wreck site were timely when the book was written but somewhat dated to a Titanic history student. I found his interpretation of the development of life as troublesome. It really spoiled my enjoyment of an otherwise good read. The quality of the book itself was excellent.
3,"good bad, bad binding","Cute book, but our library copy has been out on the shelves for less than a year and its already fallen apart! boo!"
4,A Newcastle movie rivalling Get Carter,"...This is a gangster movie with a twist. Alongside Tommy Lee Jones and Melanie Griffiths you find Sting ( carrying coals to Newcastle indeed) and Sean Bean. The plot is pretty straightforward, mafia boss comes to do a deal on Tyneside and tries to get rid of the minor obstacles in the process. The movie goes along a la Long Good Friday but without the mystery and menace. Gratuitous violence is liberally sprinkled around as are the shots of the city. Nowhere in the movie do we have a shot of the city of Gateshead located on the opposite bank of the river where the Michael Caine movie, Get Carter was filmed, but the movies themselves have some similarities.In the end Sting and Sean win the day...All in all an enjoyable gangster flick with a Geordie accent. Has a lot in common with that Geordie TV series Spender starring Jimmy Nail with incidental music by my old friend Tony MacAnaney also worth watching if it is ever shown in your area."
1,Defective DVD,"This DVD played OK for about the first half, then defective... all scrambled... tried it on four different players... no joy"
3,"Great Movie, bad disk","This is a great movie, a five, but I've had two copies of the DVD and both started out fine but became useless after two or three playings. All other DVD's I play work fine in my player."
4,Stormy Weather-more like Stormy emotions,"Interesting film, with the story actually focusing on Mr. Sean Bean, rather then Tommy Lee Jones and Mrs. Griffith. The performances are well done. Sean Bean and Sting are very well with the charactors, however Mr. Jones is not convincing as the villan. The whole idea that such violence would erupt over one man's need for a nightclub is a little unbelievable. However, watch it to see the highly watchable performances of Melanie Griffith and a young Sean Bean."
4,I want to believe in magic,"What's going on here? Here I am, the eternal skeptic, reading what seems to be a perfectly normal Ph.D thesis from a University of California Graduate student, and the next thing, I could be reading ""Lord of the Rings"" with Don Juan substituded for Gandalf. AND, AND... the funny thing is, I really want to believe that it's true. Is there magic in the world? Real magic, not deja vue and spoon bending, I mean lightning bolts, teleportation and Dragons. Casteneda almost convinces me."
1,"I'm sorry, but I do need to lower the overall rating score",Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledgeby Carlos Castaneda is a complete hoax. I feel that I need to make my score--that of one star--count twice because 'Dr.' (if I may correctly call him that) Castaneda has made this and other books out of pure fabrications. Please DO NOT buy this book. Just check out all the other 'one star' scores to read what has been said by other people who know this.
5,A bood for a twenty-something today,I read Don Juan when he first hit the scene. I found that my 20-something nephew-in-law informed me he was into metaphysical things and so I bought him this intro to Don Juan to see if he could find the same things I found in the book. I hope he has.
1,Please avoid the writings of Carlos Castaneda.,"Mr. Castaneda used a vast amount of halucinogens (Datura, mushrooms, and Peyote) to name only three various halucinogens he used.There is no need to to take halucinogens to participate in Shamanic journeying.Here are four ways that are just as valid, and more importantly SAFER.Drumming (listening to a real drummer or drumming tape), Fasting, meditation, or thirst. All three will move the brain into the Shamanic state of consciousness and open the doorways without adding toxins to your system.Your body is a temple, treat it as such."
3,"Content interesting, but writing dull","I'm glad that this book is out there, because the content is very interesting. If all that's written is true, then Carlos Castaneda definitely had an interesting experience to share with the rest of the world.I just wished that the author didn't write the book in such a dull and rigid tone. It was a complete drag to read--so much that I started to lose interest in what he had to say.Why did Castaneda have to write in this style? I also bought the next book--A Separate Reality, but have not even opened the book. I wish I could learn about his experience without having to go through the pain of deciphering his meaninglessly scientific prose."
1,Casteneda's books are a hoax.,"It is no coincidence that the most recently published book by Cateneda was only a few years ago. The first book, ""The Teachings of Don Juan..."" was around twenty-five years before when mysticism and psychedelics where in fashion. Those same fashion trends have sprung up again which prompted a new book to be published and feed off the interest in the unproven and mysterious. The reason Carlos Casteneda has never been photographed is for the same reason all charlatans are never allowed to be examined by scientists. Of course, fans of Casteneda will reply by saying that western scientists are not of Castenda's culture and therefore their methods irrelevant to the Sorcerer's way. None-the -less, I abhore who ever Casteneda is and his publishers for printing such crap, which encourages the use of dangerous drugs and the belief in the unreal. I do not recommend these books."
2,Caveat for Castaneda's first book,"I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first. But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda. The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught."
1,Wanted to like it but ...,"... I didn't.Maybe I just wasn't 'ready' for it or maybe my taste in writing and expectations of this book were at odds. Whatever the reason, I found the writing style difficult and the story quite boring (sorry, but I did). It is so very dry. At times, it read like a recipe list on the rituals and effects of taking mind altering drugs and never really gets anywhere.Maybe I missed it, but I didn't find any revelations or insights into spirituality nor pearls of wisdom nor did I find the story interesting in its own merits. I really had high hopes for this and wanted to like it but in fact found it a struggle to read and nearly gave up several times.The 5 star reviews that this has received, as well as some personal recommendations suggest that there is a very real fan base and merit in the writings. However, its not for everyone."
3,Its worth is in its call for action not more words,"All I can say about this book is these words have an inherent danger in them that is dependent upon the reader. If you find the ""story"" of Don Juan and his sorcerer's way of life informative it will provide your mind with yet another playful perspective in which to judge yourself and reflect on your every day actions. However, if you see these words as truth or a hope for truth they may ignite a fire that will not easily be quenched. In the words of another; "" in the search for meaning better never begin, once begun, better finish"". Upon completion of this work I hope you have the guts to follow your heart. See you in Mexico."
5,Best Book in Jail,"While on a ten day unwanted vacation, paid for by the state, I stumbled upon this book. It is written as a first person narrative, which allows for much more knowledge to be gleaned than the surface story admits, depending on your own personal level of growth. After reading this one, I not only bought it but I also bought and intend on reading the other two in the series. Provocative and Inspirational."
3,Entertaining but false,"Having read several of Castanedas books and been strongly influenced by them as a youth, it was with great sadness that I subsequently found them to be almost completely imaginary. If you care to research Castaneda you will find that most of his experiences of flying through the air, encountering supernatural Mexican wisemen, receiving transcendental illumination etc etc happened while he was sitting in the library at UCLA. Many of the dates in the books are contradictory, much of the alleged herbal knowledge is potentially dangerous and essentially the bottom line is that you would be well advised to take all these books with a very large grain of salt. However that being said, they are fairly well written, quite entertaining and do contain some measure of truth after all. So go figure..."
1,"Why is this still catalogued as ""nonfiction""?","When I was a teenager I eagerly devoured all the books in this series, and their presentation as nonfiction works affected the way I read them. Like many others, I was duped. These books still have some genuine interest and redeeming worth, but not as nonfiction, and it is definitely a disservice to present them as such. Maybe we need to include these books in a special subcategory: ""Nonfiction, bull****ting"" . . . or some such. Really, these are best enjoyed as works of fantasy. I could give a higher rating if the author had been more honest in his presentation, but as they were presented to us they are potentially harmful to gullible readers. I think a lot of people have been hurt as a result of having accepted these writings as nonfiction."
4,Fact or Fiction Still a Very Intresting Book,I realize that there is some controversy surrounding this book and that there are quite a few who believe that Castaneda did not base this book on actually fact. I think that this is very likely but in the end I do not care. What I read in the book was the story of a man who is intrested in Shamanism and the exploration of realm of consciousness that one would not normally have acces to. Whether Don Juan was an actually person or simply an alter ego of Castaneda is not really the point. This is one mans journey of self discovery and I throughly enjoyed it on that level. While I would never try any of the stuff mentioned in this book I do find it inspiring in that it encourages one to look at their perception of reality and what really is ordinary. Is this a factual scholarly refrence? Probally not. Is it a very entertaining and intresting book? Without a doubt!
3,A bit disappointing,"I probably would have given this book a higher rating if it hadn't came so highly recommended.As it was I found it disappointing. Though Castaneda gave an interesting account of his experience, the lengthy detail of it was a bit dry. I achieved no revelation, and neither I think did he.Either this book is just too deep for me to understand, or it lacks substance, as I just didn't get anything out of it."
1,wrong item,"I ordered a collectible hardback and received a poor quality softback instead, right before christmas."
1,Casteneda: shaman or sham?,"I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously. For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described. Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.htm"
1,"I'm sorry, but I do need to lower the overall rating score","I'm sorry, but I do need to lower the overall rating score.Because I agree with that title from another review and it sums up the book. It's FICTION, people! He made it up! Get with the program, kthx."
1,Field Guide for Finding Drugs in the Desert,"I find it necessary to include the fact that I read this book for class and not from personal interest.Though I agree with previous comments that the book was well written regarding style and grammar, I found reading this book to be a laborious task. The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you. The book is basically a series of accounts of one man's experiences with wacky weed and magic mushrooms."
5,This is a great album,"I got this album when it was first released in 1990. Back then, somehow it seemed like a ""scary"" album. Well now, in some ways, I suppose it still is. This album was a radical departure from the stuff Psychic TV was previously known for. And yet, in some strange way it seemed oddly familier with respect to that stuff. Very consistant album.. cold and unnaturally bright sounding hypnotizing repetitiveness dance, if you like one song, you'll love them all. This CD is a masterpiece, it's a sure thing, and this is coming from someone who likes TG and Splinter Test as well. Order this album, and if you like it, order ""PEAK HOUR"" as well.. believe me they go great together. In closing, let me make one thing clear.. Best track on CD: BLACK RAINBOW !!!!"
1,over priced...under sized!,if you're small or a child you'd like the size of these....BUT no one would like how easily we used them one time and the body of one leaked and the pillow part of the other leaked...both at the seams! Third time we couldn't even use them...we had to keep getting off and blowing them back up! Save your money and go to the Dollar Store and get one for a few bucks! Won't be disappointed when they pop after three uses!
4,beautiful,"Looks better than the picture on line, size is good match to my normal size. Love this ring ,would buy others like this."
1,Rhonda,I was not satisfied with this purchase. It did not look the same as it did online. It didn't fitas the other ring I purchased. It sits in the box because I've waited too long to return it.
5,Great Deal,What a beautiful ring! The stone is a light clear blue and the silver is substantial for the low cost. I recommend this ring as it is a great deal.
4,Nice Ring,"Just got this last night and the color is true to the picture. Size felt a little big but not too bag. The stone is a little smaller than I expected, but not too small."
4,Simple but beautiful,"The ring is beautiful--my colleagues complimented me on it right away. The setting is simple but sturdy and well-made, and the stone is large, very clear, and well-cut. The color is paler than on the picture, which is the only thing I can comment negatively on. In all other aspects, however, it is a very pretty ring that I would be glad to wear everyday."
1,Stone Fell Out,"The ring is beautiful, but the stone was loose in the package when it arrived.I'm going to return it tomorrow."
3,Blue topaz ring,I chose it for the lovely color of the stone. I was a bit disappointed at the plainness of the ring itself.
5,Love it!!!!,I love the color in the stone.....it's sooo pretty......I just love it!!! I love buying jewelry on Amazon.....my favorite Santa!
5,Great color,"Bought as a gift. The color of the topaz was lighter than pictured, but the person I bought it for loved it! Simple yet nice setting."
3,Not the same as pictures,"In my case the ring pictured is a bit different than the ring I received: the silver on the ring I received is thinner - inside of the ring is full in pic but most of it hollow in person, gem has much less details and top is quite flat not like the pic, stone color is darker... If you are lucky you will receive a nice ring, otherwise you will receive something slightly different than what you thought you bought. Used a Amazon gift certificate and will not send back but no more jewelry through Amazon."
3,No Way this is Sterling,"It is very bright and pretty, but the weight of the ring is very light and feels cheap. Still a t good deal for what I paid though."
2,Blue topaz ring,"Not happy with this ring. Looks nothing like the picture. The stone looks fake and the band is thin, very lightweight, just flimsy!Would send back but my husband opened it and threw all packing away."
5,"A ""once in a life time"" blue topaz ring","A ring with a stone so large and beautiful is to be rarely found at such a value. The shade of blue is light and cooling. The sterling silver setting is strong, and it's simplicity draws attention to the magnificent stone. It's a sparkling eye-catcher! I purchased one ring for myself and, after I saw it, I decided to get complete sets (ring, pendant & earrings) for all of our family's December birthdays. They will be thrilled, and I am delighted!"
4,"Lovely ring, large stone","I ordered the wrong size but that's not the seller's fault, obviously. Other than having to wear the ring on my index finger, I'm enjoying it. The stone looks bigger on my hand than I'd anticipated but I'm getting used to being ""ostentatious""."
3,"Showy size, very very pale","Nice ring, good size for my large hands, but it no way matches the color of the picture. If you're looking for a light turquoise color or aqua colored ring, this is not it. It's like water--more clear than blue. But it's well faceted, and not horrible for the price."
4,Nice ring but color is paler than the picture.,I received this ring today and am pleased with the purchase except for the color. The blue is paler than the picture. Nice solitare with a simple band for an excellent price.
2,disappointed,"Granted I only spent $22 on this ring and so maybe I should not have had high expectations, but I did expect it to last more than one week of normal usage. The prongs of the setting kept catching on clothing, and they bent almost immediately, the stone became loose and then while I was trying to bend a prong back to secure the stone, the prong broke completely off. The prongs on my ring were not nearly so smooth looking as the photos show. It was a very pretty ring, but unfortunately, not made to last."
4,Excellent Source,"This is one of the better Latin to English books on the market. It's format was great and easy to use. I was a first year Laitin student in the ninth grade and I got straight A's the whole year, thanks in part to this book. I would recommend it to any beginner or someone wanting to brush up on the language. It really is a great source."
4,Still trying to figure it out....Thanks for nothing dad,"I can definitely relate to the story line in Delicate Relations after growing up in a single parent home without a father. It truly affects you as a person, decisions you make in life, how you judge men and what you expect from relationships with others. Xichel has an exceptional way of expressing herself through words that captures it's audience. Very detailed and well written from a female prospective. After reading this, I felt the need to confront the man that was SUPPOSED to be my rock and supporter as a little girl growing up. Expecting nothing in return, maybe I will someday soon. Hopefully, this can heal old wounds and tarnish my animosity towards him. The healing process is still a long road ahead."
3,Deadbeat Dads Please Come Forward,"This new author has taken on a very sensitive topic,one that will start many fathers to thinking about the impact they have on their female offspings. As one of those daughters left behind by my dad at the age of 5, this story left me full of hope and a willingness to forgive and restore the relationship that I barely remember. Thank you Xichel for sounding forth my thoughts and feelings in this very honest reality check called ""Delicate Relations"""
5,"Excellent, Enchanting, and Soothing","Excellent, Enchanting, and Soothing is how I can best describe this cd of celtic tunes on the harp. ""Sheebeg and Sheemore/Sir Festis Burke"" is melodious and beautiful, as is ""Down by Sally Gardens,"" ""O Carolan's Dream,"" and all the rest. This ia great cd to play in a bookstore or a gift shop or a coffee shop to create that mellow, blissful atmosphere. I play it in my office while I read or type. The melodies creep into your subconscious, and they will be with you throughout the day.This is a good purchase if you like celtic harp music done well by a skilled professional."
2,Gross,This mango syrup was nothing but bad. It does not sweeten only flavors so you have to add sugar plus the syrup. I made a batch of it and the whole family wouldn't drink it. Had to dump it out and now the pretty bottle sits on a counter waiting to give it to someone who might like it. Maybe i did something wrong... dunno...
5,Kingham Does It Again,"Once again Jonathan Kingham has produced a work that is both thoughtful and well-crafted. Kingham's songwriting continues to mature as he forges into a jazzy direction with ""All That's Missing Is You"", ""That Changes Everything"", and ""I Don't Love You Anymore"", though retaining the country infusion of his previous releases. ""Only A Dream"" is a particular high point in this subtle, but strong collection of songs. It's always nice to see artists branch out into new directions, and Kingham handles this one with poise and sophistication."
2,Kylie Is MUCH Better Than This.,"Following her incredibly (and deservedly) successful debut, Kylie released her followup, a uneven mix of perfect pop and subpar tunes by Stock Aitken Waterman. ""Hand on Your Heart"" gets off to a promising start with its catchy chorus and neo-disco beat. The breezy ""Never Too Late"" works in a similar vein, as does ""Nothing to Lose."" But ""Enjoy Yourself"" loses altitude real fast after that. First off, there's the misguided cover of ""Tears on My Pillow,"" the lazy pop of ""I'm Over Dreaming (Over You),"" and the cringeworthy ""message"" song ""Heaven and Earth."" Quite frankly, the whole album sounds rushed, as if SAW didn't pay too much attention to the songs and needed to get their product out to earn a quick buck. Minogue went on to release the superior ""Rhythm of Love,"" but were it not for just a handful of singles, ""Enjoy Yourself"" would have been a dud. Save this one for the Minogue obsessives like myself."
3,Cool and upscale.,"Preppy Stock-Aitken-Waterman pop has aged gracefully these past 10 years and sets just the right mood for those days when you daydream about being rich. The uptempo tracks are generally solid, but all the ballads are a waste of time except for ""Especially For You,"" which sounds Christmas-y without being exclusively a Christmas song, kind of like Elton John and Kiki Dee's version of ""True Love.""Of course Kylie is no Sarah Brightman but you already knew that, and the arrangements carry the day. Once I even caught myself dreaming the melody of ""I Wouldn't Change a Thing,"" so how's that for a catchy hook."
4,good book,"As a kid in elementary school, I was a devoted BSC fan, and this was one of my favourite books. I love the books where the girls are into boys and dating, and this is a good example. Dawn was naive and falling for Travis, a cute 16 year old boy who was also from California, but in the end she stands up to him and doesn't let him take advantage of her like he was by buying her presents to lead her on. What a jerk!"
2,This isn't what I thought I was ordering,"I wish the 2 previous reviews had been posted when I ordered this -- I also thought it was a continuation of the numbered volumes 1-12 -- and I'd already purchased one of these 3 videos separately! Now I'm going to have to sell that one -- not that these tapes aren't good and funny, but it isn't what I expected based on the previous numbering system."
2,Deceptive labeling - this is NOT Volumes 13-15!,"Good videos BUT not the tapes I expected to find in Volumes 13-15. I was also deceived by the numbering system of this item as I already own Volumes 1-12. I expected the 13-14-15 (""3-pack"") set to be a continuation of the past numbering sequence. What a disappointment and hassle to return the tapes (at my expense) and hope my refund is in the mail. As another reviewer stated, ""This set was not what I expected. It was not the normal episode by episode that the other ""Gift Packs"" used."" I AGREE!"
4,"""Americana"" that's not annoying :)","I don't normally care for the ""Americana"" brand of music. So I was hesitant, but I really like this recording! It has a bit of that sound to it, but Wendy Liepman is such a good songwriter and the performances as a whole are fabulous so the genre is really secondary. These are just great songs performed very well.Wendy has a strong, but soft voice that is comforting and Bob's cello is a great addition.One track that seems to stand out is ""Still Small Voice"". It's a catchy, slightly twangy tune with a melody that is hauntingly familiar. Wendy's voice shines and the simple sounding accompaniment is perfect.This is a great record and these songs will stick with you."
5,The Third Edition of my book - 2005,"This is the latest edition of ""Being and Loving,"" which brings it up to date and adds new information. I hope you like it."
3,What's Black & White and Rock'n'Roll All Over?,"This is the album to get from Zebra. They were the ""unknown"" band with the semi-hit, Who's Behind the Door. This three man band's lead guitarist/singer, Randy Jackson, has the vocal stylings of a hard rock Frankie Valli. He has a HIGH voice. But that's okay, because it works on Zebra's music.The songs Tell Me What You Want, Hard Livin' Without You and Wait Until the Summer's Gone really rock. There's also some more good, melodic tunes in Bears, Lullaby and Who's Behind the Door. Also fun is Riverside and Better Not Call. The other tracks are fair.Zebra is really one of the great, but relatively ""unknown"" bands of the 80's and 90's. They're right up there with Steelheart, Thunder, XYZ and Shooting Star. Give them a try, there's some good stuff in this release."
4,They Rock!,"Hadn't heard these songs since I was in my twenties. Surprisingly, ""Who's Behind the Door"" makes sense to me only now, in a New Age'y/aliens kinda way, which is surprising for a rock band. Regardless of the lyrics, their sound is still very unique and fun. I heard they have a new album (yes, I know we use CD's now). All I can say is -Rock On!"
4,excellent new orleans band...,"fisrt heard of these guys in high school when radio was playing "" lullaby,"" and its my favorite zebra song...""bears"" and ""who's behind the door ? "" are also very good...one of the lesser known 80's bands that had gold records and a cult following..."
4,Nice just one little problem,The studs on the back of the locks are very long. They need to be cut down a bit to be comfortable. My GF had to do that she never takes them out.
3,"Extremely Basic, but Entertaining","This instructional video was originally released in 1992, two years before Joe Walsh went sober. It is painfully obvious in this video that he is slightly inebriated, which makes for an entertaining 47 minutes. My only complaint is the video consists of very very basic guitar instruction, spending far too much time on guitar setup and intonation. The only real insight one can digest is Joe's suggestions for different guitar tunings for slide guitar play. In between the setup and lesson segments we are treated to Joe Walsh playing snippets of his hits live with his band. A little talkbox performance but no lessons on this I am afraid. It would have been nice if an advanced video had been released in the series, but this is all we have for now. Joe keeps you entertained through this with all his antics, it is worth one or two viewings. Buy it used if you can."
3,"Well, it has it's good points","I love Joe Walsh, but good Lord the guy seems to be ""out there."" He may be fooling us all though.I bought this video for the truss rod/intonation info, and though that's not as detailed as I'd hoped, it's the best I've seen so far on these types of DVD's. What's frustrating is Joe demonstrates how he does it (in his own semi-understandable manner of communicating) while his clearly speaking guitar tech stands back and watches. Let the tech speak! :-)Oh well, there were some good performance cues about alternate tuning.I agree with the first post, a bit about the talk box would have been a HUGE bonus for this DVD. But, it's still ok.Just don't pay more than 15 bucks for it."
2,PLEASE A REAL LIVE SHOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i THINK YOU SHOULD BUY THIS DVD BUT WHY CAN'T ELIZA RELEASE A LIVE SHOW THAT LAST MORE THAN 55 MINUTES!!!!! PLUS IT'S 2007 NOT 2002.WHAT'S THE PROBLEM EILZA????????????????????ARE YOU OWNED BY THE RECORD COMPANY ????????????THANKS AT LEAST FOR THE LATEST LIVE CD
1,Terrible all around,"Chinos are made from a much lighter fabric than these pants. The Sizing was horrible. I wear a 36 waist. My Levi 501s are a 36 and fit like a glove. I wanted a more comfortable fit for work, so i ordered a 38. First, the waist is WAY too small. It feels like a 34. Second, the rest of the pants are VERY baggy and loose. They look and feel horrible. My waist is being choked and the rest just hangs off. I bought Gap original khakis as a replacement, and they are an improvement in every way including cost (they were $15 on clearance)."
2,Not very crisp,"I bought these for work, and while they're OK for very casual days, they don't hold a crease sharply, and they don't drape well. They just look thick and clumsy."
1,The WORST money ever spent!!!,"These pants looked, felt and wore beautifully but after 2 weeks the seams started to loosen and tear.Aweful."
1,IZOD Men's American Chino Flat-Front Metrix-Fit Pant,"Pants indicated in the paper labels and bag which is size 36 x 32, but in reality is size 38 x 32, as says the label on fabric attached to it. Very nice pants but I can not use."
2,Not as usual,"Izod fits me well and ordered these pants to replace one that I was very happy with. However, these were cut way too skimpy and didn't fit. Additionally, the color is pumice, which I thought would be an off white like the pants they were replacing, but there very white."
4,Cut is like Dockers Classic D3,"Was hoping for a slimmer cut, similar to Dockers' D2 cut, but it came as a very classic cut, which is a bit too baggy for me. Unfortunately, no way to know this before ordering. Otherwise, the quality and color looked pretty good."
4,What I Expected,"The pants were exactly what I expected, I already have one pair and have had them for a few years w/continual wear they are holding up very well so I decided to order another pair. They arrived quickly too!"
2,Overpriced and Cheap Material; Simple Pants,"The Izod American Chino is not worth the cost. While they are comfortable (the minimum requirement of any pant), they are more comparable to Lee Stain-Resistant pants which sell for about $18 at Kohls and that is what these pants should sell for. I ordered 3 but returned 2. I kept the Pumice ones only because I liked the color a lot. If you want Izod casual Chinos I recommend the Madison series instead. More comfort, better material, better made."
3,Thin fabric,I purchased a pair of these pants at a discount store and loved them. I found them on Amazon and ordered 4 pair. They aren't the same material as the pair from the other store. While the fit is great the fabric is very thin.
2,The color is different than the one in the picture.,It is really sad to get a different color degree than you saw and except from the photo. I was really disappointed and I had to get another one from different place.
2,Not too good.,"The book had okay stories, but it was embellished too much. Plus, the pictures were pretty cheap, they were all really dark and fake."
2,Slaow and Boring,"My better half tells me that the author of this series is very good, and the book this series is based on is excellent. But she agrees with me that this is the worst Swedish film we've seen recently. This same review will be applied to the other four films in series 1, save your money."
5,Love it!,"If your using the herbalife formula 1 shakes, then this is a must have. I always add the water or milk first and then add the powder, hold down the little button for 10 seconds and it is all mixed together. With the mixer there is no clumps of powder. When I used to use a spoon, I could barely drink the shake there were so many clumps left."
3,"Can't decide, but probably will return.","I purchased this watch as a knock around the yard one so I would not mess up my good watch. That said, my expectations were not very high, but I wanted one that at least felt comfortable and would stand up to some wear and tear. I don't think this one is up to the job. It rattles around on my arm and makes that cheap ""tinny"" sound that cheap watches make. It looks OK, the face is pretty large - almost like a midsize - and easy to read. The date section is a little too large and is distracting, but I can read it all without my glasses, so that's OK. For the price (under $70) it's OK, but just. If I'd tried it on first I would not have purchased it. Now I debate throwing away shipping charges or just learning not to shop online for things like watches without trying them on somewhere first. If in doubt, don't bother with this one."
3,Great watch.,"Great watch for the price. The date window is different , but still not bad. Would recommend for any woman wanting a sporty, reasonably priced watch."
1,This has got to be true!,When I started reading this story I knew it was something different. This is not an ordinary erotic tale. It is obviously not fiction. This is real! No one could make this up. It is so exciting I literally could not put it down and read it all in one session. Unbelievable! If you want the best erotic experience ever this is the one to try. I get my girlforend to read it to me and I just faint with excitement. Try it and see!
1,Yuch. Sorry I paid for this one.,"I was looking for a documentary on Solomon's Temple, what it may have looked like to the High Priest or a Levite as they walked around, how Gentiles might have seen the Temple for the first time. But this! This was a mediocre script read by an armature with some unrelated so-so CGI of the Temple. Yuck."
3,May not be what you are looking for,This is very good album but if you are looking for the vocals that came with classics like Cannibal song and the live version of So What you will no be finding that on this album. Even though it was put out by wax trax it is more of a folk album. The change is quite good though.
4,My boys love it!,I have 2 boys that love Thomas and they love to load up their belt and take it everywhere with them. Well worth buying it for them.
2,Not good,"Doesnt hold the small trains well. My kid never wears this belt. No attraction, too bulky, and the train seems unsafe (fall-of when running). Dont buy this belt. Buy additional trains instead. Those are durable."
5,Eiesely's The Night Country is Fantastic,"Track down and read all of Loren Eiseley's books. In The Night Country, Eiseley, one of the last century's premier thinkers, writers, and poets, writes beautifully and thoughtfully of his boyhood, lost civilizations, and the beauties of evolution. This is a deeply moving book that you will long remember."
3,Meh...,"Like many people who read this book, you're probably assigned it for a class. This book really wasn't all that great. There are so many other womens studies books that outline feminism so much better. A word to all of your professors assigning it--stop."
1,Video,"NEVER RECIEVED IT, NEVER RECIEVED RESPONCES BACK WHEN I EMAILED THEM SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH AMAZON. DID GET MY $$ BACK."
3,Eh.,"My friends who have seen this singer play shows recommended this to me, even before it came out. They gave me a gift certificate for my birthday, so I took a chance and used it to get this.It's only ""eh"" at best.(meaning not totally terrible, although it feels too long a record by midway through)"
3,if ever,"worth the 3 bux for the song ""if ever"".....but better yet.. save ur money and by the masters of horror cd cuz u get the acoustic version of that and a bonus mudvayne track.....but dont pay over 6 bux for it. this band sounds like every other pop rock band not emo but on the verge of it. 3 stars just because u gotta have talent to make music."
2,Nothing impressive,"I got this CD after seeing what I remembered as a decent video on Fuse TV. Maybe I was half-asleep, because after listening to this ho-hum entry into the world of emo copycats, I can't even remember or recognize which song it was. This album is ultimately forgettable-- better off listening to any Jimmy Eat World CD again and again, which is actually an enjoyable experience."
2,The difference between a live show and the cd:,"...Is nothing. Their Seattle show was really dull, the cd, which I bought on the way out after meeting the band, was worse. Sorry, I felt like it was the thing to do after the show, hoping it would be better, but it's really, well, just dull too. So I spent about $50 between tickets and souvenirs that night, and even though its not possible now, I was sort of wishing for a refund."
2,"""More Cowbell!""","I can't help but picture the Saturday Night Live sketch with Christopher Walken in the studio with Blue Oyster Cult, pushing them for a slick commercial big- hit production for a major label, demanding ""MORE COWBELL!!"" Jim Scott has produced some big almost-extinct dinosaurs back in the day, but that was in the last century, so the guy must be in a bit of a time warp here, looking for something to revive his career. This band doesn't quite seem to be able to pull it off regardless, and why would they even want to? This is that album, only Walken is played by Jim Scott, and Blue Oyster Cult is played by whoever these guys are. I only checked it out because I kept getting these big flashy Atlantic email ads, but I should have realized I might not be taking the best chance when they were next to the ad that said ""Read Mudvayne's Tour Journal, click here!"" I'm bein' serious. Anyway- more cowbell! Doesn't that fix everything?"
2,You've heard this one before,"They have pulled together a few decent songs, but 70% of the album is way too sappy for me. Final verdict: the music in itself needs a lot more punch to get anything more than 2 stars from me, and it'll be impossible to shake their connections and the similarities they are going to face. Note: I did not risk a purchase, I burned it and listened to it on the way back to school. I threw it out my window. Not to be dramatic, or because it's that bad, just disappointed and knew I would not be listening to it often. If everyone else likes it, that's just fine, all I'm saying is there is better out there."
4,rock,"this is not far , it is not o.l.d. it is gratitude. it is really very good for a rock album. if u r expecting far, dont buy this. by the way, the review with the title ""blow"" was reviewing the band ""the used"". as far as i am concerned, if u buy ""the used"" u deserve to waste $20."
4,the more music from jonah the better,"I'm guessing most people are coming across gratitude because they follow and love the music jonah makes. I'd rather see his solo act (duo if you count his r2d2 side kick) onelinedrawing live than gratitude, but I'm very excited about him being in a new band. They're not covering any new ground, but it has a lot of heart, and these guys live to make music, I wish the best for them. Offer them a place on your couch if they come to your city."
1,You Have To Have A Lot Of Patience,"You have to have a lot of patience to get through this album. It hosts mediocre songs with forgettable lyrics, droney vocals, unimpressive instrumentals, but with a slick production that tries to fix everything and tie it all together. Who do they think they're fooling? It's not dull, it's just difficult to like at all. If you want my copy, head on over to Ebay, it's used but in mint condition."
1,Quit Yr Whining!,"Why the heck did i buy this CD? i have no clue..i was under the influence of the new emo generation, all of this stuff sounds the same to me..theres no originality or emotion in this stuff...its just the same thing with a diffrent package on it..My opinion? quit whining and listen to REAL music.If you like this cd check out: Story of the Year, Hawthorne Heights, and From First to Last. They play the same uninspired music, and this review could be duplicated for any of their debut full-lengths. Go pick up this cd!! It will be the next best thing to taking that $20 and setting it on fire and throwing it out the window!!!!This has to be the most uninspired album that I've had the misfortune of listening to in a LONG while. I must admit upfront that I really don't care for the genre of this band. The only redeeming quality of this disc, however, is that it doubles as a coaster for my cold beverages."
2,A Strange Thing to Edit,"I thought it was odd that they edited a song on here, but they still left in all the bad parts, being the other 12 songs. (shrugs)"
2,A review of this band playing Warped Tour,"I think I remember seeing this band name on TRL once, and then I saw this band on the list of groups playing Warped Tour this year, and since my uncle is driving me to the festival , I figured I'd check 'em out. It's not what i expected, but maybe my uncle will like them if he comes in to the festival with me, or else if maybe they write new songs by then. It's allright, though. (I'm going to see MXPX and All American Rejects there this year, as long as it doesn't rain)"
4,"THIS AIN""T EMO","People are jumping to conclusions before they listen to the music and calling Gratitude emo. Sure, Onelinedrawing may have been emo but this certainly isn't. It's simply great pop rock. There's no excessive melodramatics that you would hear in emo or screaming to try and make yourself seem hardcore, it's just great songs. Drive Away has some of the best hooks I've heard in awhile, The greatest wonder reminds me of U2 (in a good way), and Someone to Love knocks me out every time and the ending hook is priceless. Again, let me repeat this is aint emo, if you want that garbage listen to Hawthorne Heights or Taking Back Sunday. No tissues needed."
4,2+2 = 4,"Good album. This is not FAR, this is not OLD, or NEO. Although, take the catchiest of the songs from each and you'll get an idea. This is ""radio friendly"" Jonah. I am sure plenty of people are gonna diss this album, it surely has a major label sound to it. Jonah's vocals are solid, to be expected. The songs are melodic. Play the CD on a sunny day, driving around, windows down. All songs are pretty good, although kind of predictable."
4,Great read of Victorian England,"This book is the latest By Ane Perry in her classic Inspector Monk series. It involves a respected businessman who disappears while visiting his despicable low-life twin brother . Inspector Monk is put on the case to find the man or prove that the brother killed him, what follows is a very graphic description of the slums of England in the 1850's and how people really lived in those times. Anne Perry does a fantastic job of recreating that period of history. The book is fast-paced and has many great twists and turns until the surprising conclusion at the end. It will definitely keep you guessing throughout"
2,Tediously repetitive,"I liked Anne Perry at first but must say that the more I read of her, the more impatient I become with the tedious repetitiveness of her descriptive passages."
1,don't waste your time,"Stupidest ending ever. The writing was repetitive. If I had to read a 'well-cut coat' (he had wealth) more than 20 times and ""she had a face that showed intelligence"" a few dozen times, I was ready to give up. The plot meandered - it took forever to get to the next point. Just don't bother. Find a good book. Go do something fun. Absolutely don't have this as your only read on an airplane. Really."
3,Cain His Brother,"Not one of her best, but I enjoyed it. Perry always provides a fun read and a true mystery. I enjoy the progression of the relationship between Monk and Hester."
5,A treasure,I received the audio book promptly & the shipping package was perfect. I have enjoyed listening to this audio book while doing my needlework. I am looking forward to finding more treasures like this one.
5,Excellent political reggae/poetry,Brilliant anti racist lyrics against reggae beat. Sonny's Lettah is a classic but anti fascist Fite Dem Back and Independent Intavenshan are also fine tracks. In fact the whole CD is excellent.
1,Travel writer or Mafia biographer?,"When I read about this book and the author, I thought I would be reading another book telling about Sicily. Instead, I find that the author discusses the Mafia. He says nothing about the history of Sicily, places in Sicily or anything of interest. The entire book is about the Mafia. One time I thought he was going to talk about Sicilian customs and the people only to have him discuss the Mafia. Worst of all, the discussion had nothing to do with the custom he had started off with. He has nothing good to say about any of the towns and cities and, most of all, absolutely nothing good say about Sicily. I have read other people's comments on other books of his and I can't understand why they enjoy him so much. Most of his other books appear to be about the same subject, including his fiction works. Perhaps the title of this book should have been ""In the Mafia."""
4,very difficult subject; but intriguing ideas,"[A review of the 4th Edition, 2003.]This book studies complexity and nonlinearity across a diverse range of applications. Much of the book revolves around organic evolution and the evolution of a sentient mind. And how complexity analysis might aid in the understanding of these fields. Not the least in devising deeper forms of artificial intelligence.So intriguing techniques like cellular automata and neural networks are studied. There is a fair amount of speculation as to how these and other topics might ultimately relate to sentience or consciousness. But the musings are grounded in solid science. Like that of a Hopfield system or a Boltzmann machine. This 4th edition is a good reflection of the boundaries of our knowledge."
5,Danceable,"This CD is 10 times better than DavidZ's first one, Surf 60, which I like a lot. The lyrics are hip, and the beat is hopping! Since I don't dance much anymore, I like to clean my house top to bottom while listening to this! Thanks DavidZ!"
5,An evolutionary vision for our times by a Zen cosmologist,"Arthur Young was one of the most original and penetrating minds of the 20th century, as well as being a gifted and provocative teacher, who had a major influence on my thinking. Primarily a cosmologist, interested in the big picture and the foundations of knowlege, he disciplined himself and tested his insights by spending 17 years on the design and invention of the vertical take-off helicopter. His wide-ranging explorations into the foundations of the natural sciences, as well as the great spiritual and esoteric traditions, led him to formulate an integrative evolutionary cosmology that will, I believe, turn out to have a lasting influence and value."
5,web crawling,"Truly an all-encompassing work that bridges the gaps between such diverse fields as: biology, physics and psychology.Anyone who can expertly discuss both helicopters and consciousness deserves a read!"
3,PVD and some other stuff,"Well.. Paul Van Dyk's 45rpm was the first trance cd I ever bought.. and I must say it was very cool.. So I purchased the Vorsprung Dyk Technic, and 7 ways. After a few months, and a steady stream of raving, I have come to the conclusion that paul van dyk sounds 10000000x better live. After seeing him at a rave, I must say no CD of his does him justice. The man is an insane dj who once played from sundown to sunup at a desert party. I advise you to save your 20 dollars that would normally go to a PVD CD and check out your local rave scene to see if he will be playing anytime soon, if so you should spend that 20 dollars on a ticket to the party instead."
5,One of the BEST cd's out there by PVD.,"This cd is one of the best Trance cd's in the world. I got it last December, and I never get sick of it, especially the bonus Cd, which i happen to think is better than the original Seven Ways. The curved headcase mix for Words, and Forbidden Fruit mixes are the best from PVD. I 'm now going to buy his cd compilation, Vorschprung Dyk Technik!"
5,Everything I expected and more.............,"I first heard of Paul Van Dyke on Earth Tuner and just had to get the CD. Since I've ordered and received it, I've been playing it non-stop. The sounds are just mixed right and you can't put the music in any catagory, its just cool listening."
4,Just okay,"First of all, I would like to say that I have listened to PVD'S Seven Ways cd and found it to be somewhat repetitive and not really something that would make you get up and move. On the other hand, the bonus cd I can not comment on and give a fair review because when I purchased the cd set I recieved a duplicate cd of Seven Ways and not the bonus cd. Obviously packaging error. Does anybody out there know how I could possibly obtain the bonus cd?"
4,Live is the only way to go,"Seven ways is a good cd if you're at a party. It's too repetative at times and would probably leave you with a headache if your just chilin. I went to a Van Dyk party not too long ago and I came to the conclusion that Van Dyk has the deepest music and the best breaks. The best CD's to buy all belong to the man himself, Paul OakenfoldIf(Tranceport&Global UndergroundNY) If you're looking for the best live show find Van Dyk and go!"
3,This cd is pretty average.,"PVD is a great music artist, but his music is too much repetitive. be careful if you buy this cd and if you're into rave, its a good deal. it'll keep you awake for days after you listen to it. or sometime headaches if you don't like the beat. this cd is ok."
3,skilled in skraiping and composing,"Modern turnatblists have fairly well proven that their technical abilities can often match those of instrumentalists. The next challenge is musical composition and structure; most of the recent discs have failed to cohere (but of course that may be the postmodernist point of it all). DJ DISK's debut takes the turntablist movement just a bit further, as he lays down several tracks that advance through more than a series of samples. ""Exoskeleton"" and ""Thinking Room Sculpture"" reveal DISK's ability to ""build"" an environment from reverb and wah-wah action, then build a piece of music with ""skraiping"" and a minimum of plundered samples. The usual bizarre humor abounds as well, in ""Elevator Puss Music"" and ""Bucktooth's Berry Binge"". DISK has skills and a mind to match."
2,The Weakest FLA release to date,I cannot pin point it down however I found this album release almost impossible to listen too. Every song sounded too rough and jagged for my ears and the songs seemed to not flow together like they do expertly in other FLA releases. This is a release from 1992 at the beginnings of FLA. I am slowly getting every FLA album from first to latest. I have normally been able to find at least one song to like but on this album all the songs were rough and sounded like I was listening to a car manufacturing plant in progress.
4,clarkepsych@midsouth.rr.com,"This pond filter and fountain head perfectly suits our pond, which is about 5'x8'x 1.5 feet deep. It keeps the water clear, and the fish just love to frolic in the fountain water! We could definitely tell a difference between this filter and the standard filter that came with the Pondkit purchased from a major retailer. We highly recommend the Pondmaster!"
4,It's a book,"A book for a gift, have not read. Here are the several more unnecessary additional required words for the review."
5,The very BEST reading-Thanks Rosamunde!!,"Rosamunde Pilcher's books are always comfortable, interesting, beautifully written and pleasantly distracting from today's world, especially when about life in Scotland, her home. She understands human nature and her characters always remind the reader about someone in their own lives whom they have known."
2,Blue Bedroom Rosamunde Pilcher,I was very disappointed in this book. It just wasn't a usual Rosamunde Pilcher book. Very boring. I would not recommend this book. This is just my personal opinion. Others may like it.
5,Wonderful!,"BALLAD is brilliant, as is its author, William Sanders. This book is a must-read for any fan of contemporary literature. A fascinating blend of SF/Fantasy, Horror and social commentary, BILLY takes you to places you'll love -- heights of which you've only dreamed, and depths of darkness in which you might fear to tread. But Sanders safely guides you through it all with the talent and imagination of a master storyteller. The book contains everything that makes life worthwhile: true love, heroism, motorcycles and monsters. Who could ask for anything more?"
5,Really fine action fantasy with authentic colors,"This guy has a very solid feel for motorcycling, sex, love, trouble, fights, dirty politics, and (as far as I can tell) Native American spirituality - and his writing is superbly wry and witty. The fantasy monster itself is a little hokey, but just read around it - this author is one of the best discoveries I've run across."
1,"If you need to calculate, get another calculator","Canon HS-1200TS Desktop Calculator (7438A003AA)Canon HS-1200TS Desktop Calculator (7438A003AA)I bought this calculator because it had the backspace button. Turns out I need to use it ALL THE TIME!!! This calculator has issues with the keys not working, then even when it looks like they do, the output is wrong. Thankfully, I know a bit about math, so I know what to expect as far as a range of output. I would say it is correct 25% of the time and I suspect it is the keypad issue. This calculator is the office joke."
5,A wonderful movie!!,"I was shocked when I looked up this movie and didn't see any reviews. I saw this last year and was just mesmerized as I watched it. In many places, it is silent and yet the images it creates are powerful and perplexing. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, it makes a great companion to Schlosser's Fast Food Nation or SuperSize Me."
2,Was OK but not worth buying the DVD,What a disappointment. From reading other reviews I thought this was going to be a much better picture of how foods are processed.I thought for sure I'd be grossed out on how animals were processed but wasn't.There wasn't really anything on this DVD that I didn't already know or assume was taking place.This DVD is way over priced. I would watch this if it was on TV but would not buy the DVD if I could do over.Go look for it on YouTube or something and save your money.
5,Everyone who eats should see this film,"No dialog necessary. In fact I think it's better that there isn't any. It leaves the viewer/consumer to come to their own conclusions without the political weight that dialog can sometimes bring. These are scenes that most of us, especially in the U.S., don't usually have access to, behind the scenes of the food industry. Now, granted, these are scenes from European farms and factories (which are apparently similar but more regulated than those in the U.S.) but you get the idea. Where our food comes from is not something that most of us are very informed on....and there is a reason. If you have any interest at all in understanding your own role in the big picture, think about what you eat, and watch this documentary."
1,This Seller...,"Everything was fine with this purchase...until I wanted to return it. It was a gift and the recipient didn't want it. So, I notified Amazon and they notified the seller...twice. NO response.Amazon gave me a refund. I STILL haven't heard ANYTHING from the seller. Buyer beware!"
1,Outdated information don't buy,The information in this book is outdated even when it was published. I learned more in 2 lectures on patent law while in university. Its has been made obsolete by more recent revisions by the USPTO.
5,The book was HOT!,"I was speechless for a few moments after I finished reading this book. I was captivated by the clear and concise message that the book conveyed. The writer's personality of humor, wit, sensuality, and spirituality kept me entertained and emotionally attached to the characters in the story. The vivid portrayal of inner city life, dreams of being successful, and hardships along the way is something we all can relate to at some point of reference in our lives. This masterpiece is very down to earth, easy to read, and highly heartwarming for people of all walks of life. Overall, the book was HOT!"
4,Simple really...,"I've been a fan for longer than I care to say. On that note, just buy Agogo for the best tracks that you're missing, and use the rest of the cash on the excellent Money and Angst era remix singles. That is, of course, assuming you don't have the mainline albums."
4,i'm satisfied,I can't easily find anyone who has this album in my country. So I bought it from the far.It is satisfactory. This album has a variety of songs that i wanna swing(dance) with it.
2,Unsure,"I have searched desperately for this track. However, I am looking to find some type of clip with the refrain of ""Dancing Queen"" in it for my friend. He has not heard the song and this portion does not allow me to show him what a great song it is. Is there some way we could tap into more or is there a site that you would recommend? Can you help? Thank you so much. Christy"
1,Whoa don't buy this!,"Now that I have your attention, I would like to explain why. Firstly I have owned the vinyl copy of this since it's release and the album is amazing and something everyone should own BUT these early Young releases are in need of remastering especialy if you own a decent sound system. Young has been sitting on his a** way too long to release remasters. Rumour has it he wants a certain sound and an artist has that right but in the meantime clean these up and release them for us living in a digital world. Perhaps if the catalogue slows down pressure will be brought to bear."
4,Exit Crazy Horse enter CSNY & $,This is a good transitional album by Neil. He smartly used some of Crazy Horse and CSN to complete it before going on tour with CSNY.
2,confused,I bought this opened it up played it distorted crackles slightly off centered all over the place. The original 1970 prob sounds better. I was sad. I did buy on vinyl Everybody knows and it was better. Must be a hit or miss with vinyl these days.
5,timeless classic,This has remained my favorite Neil Young Album as well as one of my all time favorite rock albums.
4,One of Neil's Finest,"This is one of several early solo albums by Neil Young that are now classics.This album starts out with Tell me Why. Tell me why is played on an acoustic guitar. Neil flat picks the song and its actually very catchy.After the Gold Rush is a song that to this day I have never entirely understood. Well I dreamed I saw some silver space ships flying in the yellow haze of the sun.In a dream all in a dream, the loading had begun.I have always wondered if we were being saved from a nuclear holocaust or what.Southern Man is another classic on this CD. Dont Let It Bring You Down is a personal favorit of mine.When you Dance, I can really love is a great rocker.There is not really a bad song on the album"
3,Neil YOUNG!,"This is really good, but in no way compares with Harvest. Harvest is incomparable. Best music by Neil Young out side of CSN &Y."
5,Remastered Gold,"A lot of musical obelisks from the early years of recording are being remastered with amazing results. This CD is one of those. If you like Neil Yong and don't have this disc, buy it. If you love Neil Yong and have the original CD-recording, this is the opportunity to hear the music hove it was meant to sound."
3,"In/Significant Other's: ""Darkly Intriguing""","""In/Significant Other's"" is a Darkly Intriguing story that has a main storyline of an Iraqi War vet, but the movie also manages to weave into place a story of a video producer, who wants to make a documentary about a ""simple"" subject, while unknowingly steering several lives into a dramatic collision course with each other"". ""Although this movie is independantly produced, i recommend it for its ability to keep you from ""guessing"" the next scenes""."
1,Watch TV Instead,"Chunky plot, predictable dialogue, and college-student kind of directing. If this won awards, and it says it won awards, then it must have been the miracle post-production worked to make the raw material resemble cinema. Nah, that couldn't be it."
3,"Great Slinky Wizard tracks, otherwise old psy-trance","Worth getting for the Slinky Wizard tracks, as well as Technossomy if you don't have it. This is a pretty good introduction to psy-trance for those unfamiliar with the genre. Dance floor trance."
5,The modernization of electronica,"LSD changed electronic music. It was also here that you find Coil always had its creativity to do it before music had the means and equipment to actually fullfill the creative bugs in John Balance and Peter Christopherson.Acid House in some songs and this was made in 1991. When in American music scene Acid House would take nearly 2 more years to ever surface at the head of the Desert party or ""rave"" scene. Then again the pioneers like Orb, FSOL, Fila Brazillia and Richard James of aphex Twin had not yet truely discoverd what creativity they had to utilize untill Coil graced the universal unconcious.Contributions from Coil are historic, innovative and mind bendingly gorgeous. try also Coil's ""Horse Rotorvator"" which is still my favorite and now 18 year old dark, avant garde masterpiece."
2,"Addictive but awful, kind of like heroin","I read this book, and couldn't put it down, but the writing was amazingly bad. The entire idea of the book is the same as many others, such as gossip girl and a-list, but although they weren't written well, this was much worse. And if you have read the book, repetitive much?"
2,The Best Takes a Step Backward,"If you are completely new to NHL Hitz, you may enjoy this one; however, those who have owned and loved older versions may not. The fight engine has been reworked, and it has become quite clunky. The fights completely lack action now. The franchise mode no longer lets you play against real teams. Finally, you can no longer lock yourself to an individual player. You can not even lock the goalie to compuer control. This constant switching of players can be very disorienting. I was terribly disappointed to find that all of my favorite features were massively reworked for the worse or gone altogether. I am glad, though, that they used a different naming scheme. Perhaps this indicates that they meant for this to be a different game than the others. The graphics are good, and I am hoping that Midway returns to their tradition with an ""NHL Hitz 2004""."
1,Big-Time Letdown,"I've had NHL Hitz 02 and 03 both are amazingly addictive and entertaining titles with endless replay value. NHL Hitz Pro, on the other hand, has an identity crisis. It's billed as a traditional hockey game with some of the Hitz trademarks, but it just doesn't work. For one, the graphics are horrible and you are not able to switch to an on-ice view. It feels like your playing the game from the nose-bleed section of your local arena. The gameplay is ok but call me retarded because I don't believe you're able to switch your goalies during the game either. The fighting mode is really bad as is the background crowds or end of the period segways which are ALWAYS the same. I was wondering why this game got little to no publicity from Midway but now I understand completely...this game just plain stinks. Avoid!"
3,"Older version, not as useful as the new one",I purchased an older version of this book. Those students in my class seemed to appreciate their's and they did better on tests as well.
4,A Fun Shark Book!,"This book is great for kids who love sharks. It is sassy, funny and breezy. I recommend it."
4,"Great earrings, but pricey","Nice earrings and I've gotten compliments. I'm a 20-something male, by the way.But be warned: quality is not that great and they are definitely overpriced."
5,Well made,Purchased these earrings for my daughter for Christmas. They are high quality earrings. Very happy with my choice
3,Not as much fun as it used to be.,"I hate to say it, but I am disappointed in ""NFL Blitz Pro"". I had looked forward to this game and now that I have it, I can't say I particularly like it as much as I did in the previous years. I have EA's ""Madden 2004"" and ""NCAA 2004"" (PS2) for its excellent gameplay and AI, I have ESPN NFL ""2k4"" (Xbox) for it's excellent graphics, and I had hoped to have ""NFL Blitz Pro"" (PS2) for being my fun fast-paced arcadey football.Unfortunetly, ""NFL Blitz Pro"" is no longer as fast-paced and arcadey as the previous years' releases.I'll keep it and continue to play it every now and then, but I am now going to search for cheap used copies of ""NFL Blitz 2002"" and ""NFL Blitz 2003"". I wish I hadn't sold them."
5,Blitz rules,"I'm a big fan of all the Blitz games, and this is the best one yet. They've made this game just like Madden, but with better game play, better graphics, and faster paced action. I've got one preordered and can't wait. Oh, best of all, no John Madden. He's so bad, I heard EA Sports was talking to Dennis Miller about doing a football game. God he makes that game stink..."
3,Missing something...,"Fun game that mixes arcade style blitz gameplay with a pro NFL feeling to it. I read a few reviews that ""Classic Blitz"" was available to unlock. This is true, but it's not entirely ""classic blitz"" as it's missing something...the background music. I was hoping to unlock this mode to play with friends in both Pro and Classic mode but Classic mode was very disappointing... Fun game, just not for classic Blitz fans."
2,Disappointing,"Another in a line of ""Me too""s trying to be Madden. Midway took the unique, arcadey gameplay of the original Blitz and watered it down. It really feels like you are playing a marketing decision rather than a balanced, fun game. The online portion can be fun, but the controls feel sluggish and laggy. The newest version of Blitz proves that the only football game you need is Madden 2004.On a positive note, the comentary is very entertaining."
4,bad,they completly mess up with this game. They game up the uniqueness of the old blitz game and chnaged it totally. a person playing this wouldn't know it was blitz if it wasn't for the title
2,Poor Software Quality,"Kaplan TOEFL CBT tests are really buggy and scores are not accurately calculated:1. The program does not recognize correct answers where more than one answer has to be chosen.2. The program does not retain the essay.2. When shifting from the general test feedback section to a specific section analysis (reading, listening or structure) and back again to the general feedback section, all the scores for the test change. You have to go back to the Main Menu to retrive the original scores for the test.3. When re-taking the same test for a second time, the whole program locked and I could not verify my answers."
3,Listening good - remaining correct,"I think the listening of the products is good (several lessons with the paper transcript).However, the grammar part is pretty short (but with some interesting samples and rules).This book is not the best but it can be useful when combined with other books like the Barrons, Model Test, Nelson, ..."
5,SEXY SEXY WOW!! CHOCOLATE TREAT!! JAMIE WAS NICE TOO!!,"I LOVED THIS CD!EVERY SONG IS FIRE!I AM GLAD I WON IT ON EBAY!IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, I AM SORRY, FOR WHATEVER REASON IT IS OOP!!OUT OF PRINT!I LOVE THIS CD BEDROOM STORIES IS RIGHT!I LOVE IT!!JAMIE FOXX WAS AN ADDED BONUS!MELVIN WHERE ARE YOU!!?????COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!FIVE STAR CD!!*****"
3,Not His Kind of Woman by Roberta Leigh (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:'The timing is wrong for us, Di. Maybe if we meet ten years on - but not now when I've nothing to offer you.' Adam tried to be sensible for both of them, but Diana was strong-willed and used to getting her own way. She manipulated him into marriage and lived to regret it. Now they met again in vastly different circumstances and there was absolutely no point in raking over the dead ashes of their past relationship. But this time Adam was calling shots. And it seemed as if he still had a score to settle with her ..."
2,HENRY 2 WAS NO MATCH TO THE ORGINAL,"FIRST OF ALL THE MAIN CHARACTER IN HERNY 2 IS A FAT a$$, WHO WANT THAT AS A MAIN CHARCTER! ROOKER (SPELLED COMPLETELY WRONG) IS THE ONLY TRUE HENRY LEE LUCUS! A MUCH BETTER ACTER, AND SOME WHAT BUILT! SEE IT IF U WANT, IT WASN'T A HORRIBLE SEQUAL, BUT HERNY 1 IS 100 TIMES BETTER! SEE THE FIRST ONE FIRST!"
5,a monumental musical statement,"this catalogue of piano pieces is, to me, one of the most significant musical statements for the piano of the 20th century. there are many versions of vingt regards now. i have no regrets about getting this one."
3,Looks good but not very sturdy,The plastic handle to tighten the arm bars was shattered when I received the Ab-Doer. The replacment was broken as well. Furthermore the entire product seems to wiggle around as you use it and not provide a very secure base. In concept this is a good product but it is just not built very well.
1,"Abdo is ""absolutly doo-doo""","This thing is a piece of junk and honestly these people should be ashamed of themselves, even the exercise dvd that comes with the machine makes it look like a good workout, except that the equipment doesnt flow smoothly like it does on the infomercial or in the dvd, its stiff and uncomfortable and the ""mesasger"" hurts. I dont think I will ever watch late night informercials again, I have learned an expensive lesson."
3,So-so,"Having owned the original Ab-Doer(until I wore it out), using the 'Extreme' is much more difficult, and far less comfortable. Much harder to use, which also means the desire isn't there. The spring is too stiff, and the handles are way uncomfortable. I've also noticed that this is far harder on the back. Caveat Emptor!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money !,"I bought the Abdoer Twist and within 40 days the main tension spring broke.I had a very hard time convincing service representatives (many more than a few calls) that they had a defective product and I expected a replacement spring. They continually said that this occurred outside the 30 day warranty period. I finally convinced them to send a new Spring at no charge even though they wanted to charge me more money.Well, guess what !It broke again in the very same place.The machine doesn't provide a very effective workout to begin with, but I'm not even going to try and get it replaced again because I'm sure I'll just get the run-around again.Headed for the dump.Do yourself a favor.Don't purchase this piece of #*@^ !"
1,terrible!,"I used it for a few days and all I got was a backache! Get an exercise ball and do crunches or the Gaiam ball, or Abdominal straps!"
1,to good to be ture!,"when I have this product I am so happy to have a dream work out my abs it look nice an achieving then something goes wrong I felt this is not working for me. I need to do something more exercise, so I go to the gym to do more work out with my abs it work fast than this product. It massage my spine not actually massaging my muscle which is bad for my bones (spine) it hurts. It end up displaying on my living room an I just let my wife use it when she feel like it. It's worthless, the gym gives my abs in shape fast with all the different variety of machine. If you want to focus on your abs just manage your waste not the pounds."
4,Good machine,Good machine - excellent price - purchase & shippingBut remember! You gotta get on the thing and do the work.
5,Cool chick flick,"Cool movie about a girl who wants another girl's man and the 'extremes' she goes to get him. Good movie for high school age girls, or older, to watch for a 'girls night out'."
3,missing songs,"I was missing the song that plays when ROY and ANGELA are at the bowling alley. For you guys, this is ""More than this"" from Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music.There are other songs missing too...But overall, it's good."
1,Don't waste your money buying the Kindle edition,"Most of the learning exercises are based on a sample map, this obviously comes with the printed copy. So the Kindle edition is totally useless without the map."
4,Be Expert With Map & Compass,"I bought this book for my daughter, now studying in Japan. Turns out that it's not easy to determine which way trains, etc. are going on train stations so she asked for a compass. Along with the compass I got her a book on both compass and map reading. The book looks like it covers what one needs to know pretty well. As a pilot & architect (and former Boy Scout)I'm pretty familiar with the subject but as these skills are not as intuitive as one might expect learning them with the use of this small book is a pretty good choice. Besides, what to do when the GPS doesn't work, or the batteries run out...?"
2,slowest shipping ever!,"I placed an order for this book on December 3rd. It is now December 27th and I still have not received the book. I contacted the seller, and they informed me it shipped on December 6th from Oregon and was sent to a bulk mailing center and that they have no control over the mail. I understand the seller may be frustrated by the inefficient USPS, but I also think if I had ordered this from somewhere else, I may have received the item before Christmas. Very disappointed."
4,Excellent instruction and easy to read,"This book provides excellent instruction on land navigation. Even if you know nothing of how to use a compass or map when you begin reading, you'll have a good working knowledge by the time you're through with the book. It is well written, easy to understand and even includes a fold-out topographic map in the back (actually, about a third of a topographic map, but it gets the job done). The map allows you to work the exercises found in the book (which are quite helpful). The book was written some time ago and Hjellstrom does focus on the sport of orienteering, but as the entire point of that activity is navigation using a map and compass, I don't see this as a negative. As others have pointed-out he does not cover newer topics such as GPS or altimeters, but if you're buying it to learn to use a map and compass, that really isn't an issue either. This is a well written book that provides solid instruction and is certainly worth the purchase price."
4,"Well explained, well structured!","Good book!This book is divided in two parts:One that explains in a very easy way how to use map and compass and the other part is an explanation about an activity or sport called orieentingif you are not interested in orieenting maybe the second part of this book will be useless for you.BUT the first part (how to use the map and compass) worths every dollar spent, instructions about how to use your map and compass is meticulously explained, and well structured."
2,Better choices for basic map and compass navigation,"A decent introduction to the sport of orienteering, but there are much better choices for learning general navigation skills. The writing style is annoyingly elementary, as are the plugs for a specific brand of compass. The fold-out map is a handy feature, though."
2,Might be good for a ten year old otherwise dont waste your money,"It is an orienteering book, not a land navigation book. It could be alright for beginners, and I mean people who dont know what magnetic field lines are. But if you are looking for information on backcountry navigation you won't find it here. It contains more information on games than it does on GPS. If you serious about learning to use a compass don't wast your money, getMap Reading and Land Navigation (FM 21-26)orThe Essential Wilderness Navigator: How to Find Your Way in the Great Outdoors, Second Edition"
4,"Still ""the"" book on orienteering!",This most recent revision & update by the original author's devoted daughter is true to the aim of Bjorn Kjellstrom. It is immediately a classic update to include current additions in the technological world of navigation. The book is especially a favorite of any formal or informal group & is the subject of many fun student exercises. I would recommend this third edition highly as a basic rock to all the learning that follows your evolving skills to know where you are and how to get to where you want to be.
4,Be and Expert w/ map and compass,This book is the genuine article. It teaches important orienteering skills. The skills drills in the book are vital for learning and fun to do. I strongly recommend this book.
4,No instruction sheet??,"While we are pleased with the drum set and all it includes, we are very unhappy with the fact that no instruction sheet was included in the box. We had to piece it together as best we could. Very disappointing......."
5,Capresso Water Filters,These filters are getting hard to find so I was very pleased to be able to buy a year's supply.
3,We have the coffee pot,We purchased the pot several years back and every six months or so we have to change the filter even though we use R-O or bottled water.
5,Why buy 4 months worth when you can buy a year's worth!,These are the same that I've been buying individually for years. It is nice to stock up and have a years's worth.
2,i dont like it,this thing doesnt work very good. maybe for the first few times you use it. after that is dosnt sharpen right.
2,"OK for filters, doesn't explain extensions","On the positive side, the book does describe how ISAPI filters work.On the negative side, it doesn't explain at all how ISAPI extensions work (and most will write far more extensions than filters). ALL of the stuff on ISAPI extensions is built on MFC or Delphi code, which aim to hide the mechanics from the programmer. The issue of how ISAPI extensions work is waved off by the author as drudgery. Drudgery it may be, but it is the topic the book claims to address but doesn't.I would give the book one star rating out of sheer frustration with the extensions material, but some would find the filter stuff useful, so I'm forgoing a completely negative review."
5,Oh Hell Yeah!!!,"This is the best damn Ice Cube single I've ever heard. It's the best single out right now. Ice Cube has made it very clear that he is BACK with this single, and Mr. Short Khop (I think that's his name) at the end shows great promise. Buy the album or buy the single, just get this song!!!"
4,kids like it,"The kids like this alot the playfoam itself isn't messy at all, more clean than play doh. It's all the little pieces, feathers, rolly eyes etc. that have me picking up alot. Kids like it I suppose thats what counts!"
3,Good for a while,This was a good toy to play with a time or 2. But kids got bored with it quickly. Need more things to do with it
1,"Did Not Live up to Its Promises, Would Not Recommend","Bought this because it was described as not being messy and, actually, that true. Problem is it doesn't really stick together and it's nearly impossible to make most any of the animals shown. Even the adults couldn't make it work. The kids were frustrated and I was embarassed to have brought this gift to the party. I do not recommend."
1,Didn't Live Up to the Promises,"Purchased this for my granddaughter's birthday and she wanted to try it out right away. 3 children and 2 adults tried to make these animals. Problem is it simply doesn't stay stuck together unless you make something simply like a round ball. The little plastic pieces would not stay for 2 seconds. It seems that in creating something that doesn't make a mess, which was a successful feature, they somehow made it so that it won't stay molded. All of us grew frustrated. I would not recommend this because while being no mess, it does not work well, and was no fun for the kids. Stick with PlayDoh, at least it sticks."
5,this cd is incredible!!,"i have the previous dzihan & kamien cds but i have to say this one just blows them all away. its one of my favorite albums and is an absolutle work of art. i would definetly recommend everyone to buy it even without listening to it. trust me, you will NOT be disappointed..."
4,High Quality Music,"This is some of the most well produced music I have heard in a very long time. More than half the CD is top notch music, but the other part kind of bogs down. Overall, however, the whole CD is a great listen, with the first two tracks really standing out. It is interesting to note that the majority of well produced music comes from outside the United States. Just a thought."
5,Jazzy feel...,"These guys can put the beats together. This cd has a little more of a jazzy feel to me than Freaks & Icons did. I don't which one is better, they are just different but equally excellent. I would recommend them both."
3,"Good, but...","I bought this album at the same time as ""A Strangely Isolated Place"" - Ulrich Schnauss, with the intention to be able to listen to the music in the background while working or chillin'. After listening to both, I find that ASIP is much easier to listen to. Gran Riserva is well produced, crisp and funky, and demands attention. Which is fine if you want to dance, but it's not easy to listen to and relax at the same time. A few tracks like ""Ford Transit"" and ""Sliding"" have disonant elements which add a sense of unease. Eclectic is a good description."
4,Contrasts....we got em!,"Anyone who can put Eddie Van Halen's famous solo instrumental ""Eruption"" into a chilling out record AND make it sound cool can definitely help you wind down! This is a good modern take on early Pink Floyd by a non-guitar combo, and a good example of what can be done with samples as an alternative to 140bpm dance music. Nice to hear something that doesn't have much structure in a world of 3-minute verse/chorus/hook pop tunes."
3,"kind of like an extended version of ""Animals""","What with the bleating sheep and spacey guitars, this reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd's ""Animals""....the REALLY extended remix! Not bad altogether, even if the Wichita linemen song doesn't sound in any way familiar to me..."
5,A journey through the depths of the human soul,"Imagine yourself in another person's body...impossible? Not with KLF's Chill Out, the album that can literally pluck you out of your bedroom and drop you in a Kansas corn field, watching the sun come up over the vast horizon. If music ever summed up human existence, of solitude, of progress, of being lost and finding, Chill Out will forever remain among the most telling albums."
4,blissed out at 5am,"I recently found about this CD 7 years too late - I had only heard of the 'chill out' CD by the KLF mentioned by various people over theyears but had never actually seen it/heard it.To make a Cd as chilled out as this - and for me to get a copy of it 7 years after it has been released and for it to STILL sound so amazing is pretty amazing.If you've had a big night out clubbing, get back to someones house and at around 5 am blaze up a couple of big biftas and put this Cd on - sheer bliss."
5,Something different,"Okay. Slow music often doesn't appeal to me. But as someone who sometimes finds himself on the open road at night, there is just something about this album that appeals to me. Perhaps it is the strange combination of Americana sound clips with a little Euro mystique, courtesy of the KLF. Perhaps it is that feeling of being simultaneously at peace and excited in a strange universe that the KLF seems to convey to me (much like being on the open road at night). Or maybe it is something different altogether. Needless to say, I just can't walk into a truck stop without thinking of this album. But as to whether you will like it, you will just have to give it a listen. It is not really much like their dance-oriented 'White Room' (another GREAT CD). So you really can't base your decision to buy it on this. You just have to hear for yourself."
1,The Great Chill-Out Swindle,"Oh dear, oh dear...Just imagine my suprise when I arrived home after having shelled out an ENORMOUS amount of money for this and slipped it into my CD player. I thought there was something odd when after 7 minutes there was till no music. This inital disappointment gave way to stunned disbelief when I realised that I'd just purchased 44 (that's forty-four, ladies and gentlemen) minutes of sampled sheep, radios, trains... I keep reading that this ""album"" was a groundbreaker in its genre. Well that may be, but it's still a rip-off in my opinion. And it was recorded ""live"", whatever that means."
2,Not really music- just the occasional random sounds,"if you like this sort of thing, meaning random sounds that can get kind of annoying and have no point then buy this- and dont be mislead- this is not an album to chill to like you can with Air or Morcheeba- it is not even music except for like the occasional sample of some. I even recently read in an article that this album was an intentional joke on the consumer industry by KLF. I dont understand the hype."
3,Interesting Debut from KMFDM,"I think to really appreciate this record you have to realize where it was coming from. KMFDM started as a 'ultra heavy beat' industrial band. They had little money for the real good equipment so thats where it shows on this recording. The original KMFDM lineup is a classic. Sascha Konietzko, En Esch and Raymond <PIG> Watts. The first track ""Kicking Ass"" is awesome. It incorparates sly vocals by Ray, with simple bass and some En Esch guitar work. The next track ""Me I Funk"" is awesome at times. With a punkish chorus, and screaming Sascha vocals, its not too bad musically, though it could of been a little shorter. Its probably one of those things where you have to get into a groove for the real feeling behind it. Track 5 ""Itchy Bitchy"" is hilarious. You have to hear it. The rest of the cd however is rather disapointing. Its slower, cruder and too experimental. Only get this if youre a big KMFDM fan, otherwise this might turn you off from them."
3,Early KMFDM,"First half of this album is great but leter on through out it slows down. what i like about the first half thay have vocals & dislike the last half be cause thay don't have any vocals.If you like ""Don't blow your top"" you will also like this album! thay both have the some sound to it.I think if thay have put the some effort into the first half some with the last it would been 10 times better."
4,A bit of a slow starter to win your charms,"This is a fantastic CD with cool synth work and rather political...lyrical themes . The reason why I say this is a slow starter is that when you first buy it you may think some of it sounds dated and only a couple of tracks are worth the price of the CD . You may leave this CD for a couple of weeks and then come back to it and then suddenly it just starts to click with you and you begin to like it more .My favourite tracks on this are Me I Funk ( that extended synth riff is just too cool ), What Do You Know , Itchy Bitchy ( for complete pervs only ) and the last track , The Unrestrained Use Of Excessive Force . This is a rather strange song . It sounds really eerie and ends with a harsh drum crashing it's endIt's recommended but just don't expect it to hit you over the head and make you fall in love with it . It has to be dealt with subtlety"
4,Love Those Cards,"I've had a deck of these cards for some years and enjoy playing cribbage with them. Saddly, they are becoming a bit frayed around the edges as well-worn cards are wont to do. I was most gratified to find that the Key to the Kingdom deck is still available. So I got another deck to use on special occasions."
5,Richly designed,This is a drop-dead gorgeous deck of cards and with the delightful accompanying rhymes is fun for use as a kind of quirky (free association) cartomantic deck as well as for regular play. A quality production & beautifully packaged book/card set. Highly recommended!
2,magnet does not stick to tape,"the first time I used these I found the magnet did not stick to tapelike the old ones I used did. very disappointed . only good for oneuse, and that would be too costly for someone that uses them daily."
5,Legendary,"In my opinion this was the best Zelda game, mostly for all the reasons most people hated it. The time concept added a challenge, the freakier atmosphere gave it a unique feel, and the mask have been the most diverse items I have used in any Zelda game."
3,Just doesnt feel like a proper sequel to Ocarina,"Almost anyone who owns an N64 knows of the game Ocarina of Time. This is an amazing game so obviously the sequel on the same console would be even better right? Well no Majora's mask is A LOT different instead of fighting Ganon or saving the Princess Zelda you are on a quest for companionship. when you head out of Highrule you are attacked by Skullkid, he steals your ocorina and turns you into a deku scrub. this doesn't feel like a rightful follow up to one of the greatest games of all time, but if your new to the series and want a taste of some VERY different gaming experiences then try this game out"
5,Ego Plum is a ruppa-pLum-pLum GENIUS!!!,"What a brilliant and carnivalesque experience really, and one with fun-loving pop sensibilities that at times possibly mimic the melodic magical tapestry that The Beatles created in their ""Revolver"" era of creativity. Forget the Oingo Boing references, this is a different and more surrealist vibe all together. It's fun for the whole family! Imagine taking Pablo Picasso and Nino Rota out for a lunch at the LA Zoo, and then while they're there, someone slips them some mushroom tea, blindfolds them, then takes them to the circus... This is the music that would be playing in their heads! This album and his co-composing on ""The Devil's Muse"" are both incredible. What a genius, and his band is absolutely incredible too. They all deserve praise!!!"
4,Egypt,"This is just what my friend asked for. The book arrived on time and wellwrapped however I think the description of the condition was a bit generous.Working in a library and for book resellers i know this book should have beengiven a good rating for the curled over alone. Otherwise, the contents were tight."
5,Enjoyment of Learning about Egypt,"I have been interested in Egypt virtually all my life, and have read many books about it over the years. The reason I bought ""Temples, Tombs & Hieroglyphs"" is because I knew that Barbara Mertz was the author Elizabeth Peters of Amelia Peabody fame - and Amelia Peters is a favourite of mine.Dr Mertz combines her wealth of knowledge with her personal style of writing, which makes reading this book just sheer pleasure to read. The book is informative, easy to read and, as already stated, pleasurable to the very end. She provides a reading list for those readers who want to pursue the subject further, and I for one, will be ordering some of these very shortly."
5,colorful egyptology,"If you have ever read Barbara Mertz and Barbara Michaels or Elizabeth Peters, you already know how colorful her writing is. If she can bring fiction to life the way she does, you can only imagine what she does to non-fiction. Temples, Tombs, and hieroglyphs bring history to Egypt in the way only Ms. Mertz can!"
5,The thirteenth year VHS,I purchased this movie for my (then 8 year old) son who has a thing for mermaids/merpeople. So naturally he likes this movie. It has a good storyline and a good ending. Am glad I purchased this movie.
5,For those who give this a 1 or 2 stars well then...,"I repeat, who ever gives this game a 1 or 2 stars SUKS!!! THIS IS GAME IS SWEET... LOOK I HAVE PLAYED EVERY AND I MEAN EVERY GAME TITLE FOR B-BALL ... WHEATER IT BE NBA STREET... NBA LIVE OR ANY OTHER WORKING TITLE FO B-BALL THIS GAME IS PROBABLY THE BEST ONE SO FAR! THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING... WHEN I SAW VINCE CARTER, I THOUGHT THAT I WAS WATCHIN TV!! IT IS SO LIFE LIKE... THIS GAME IS CHALLANGING.. AND FUN ALL AT THE SAME TIME.. U CANT GET ANY BETTER THEN THIS ... I CANNOT BELIVE ANYONE COULD GIVE THIS A 1 OR 2 STARS... I CANNOT BELIVE IT.... WHEN THIS GAME COMES OUT FO THE PSP (WHICH I HAVE) I AM DEFINATLY GETTIN IT..."
4,N...B...A...buhbuhbuhbuhballersss,"wow this game is real fun when u start it.i got it for 35 bux mad cheap.wen i started i played my friend and he won all the time.but i brang it home created my own baller and made him go from rags to riches.i had him gettin the best from hot clothes to hot mansions to chix to hot rides.and i got it all by beatin some ballers like kobe and kidd.u go up against ballers like shaq mutombo nawitzki,on and on.they got legends like doctor j.the only problem i have with it is that ya only play onevone and that gets old real fast.if they included some 3vs3 action it wouldve been much better.and to make a practice mode so that u could practice doin moves by urself not someone standing there and takin the ball away from u.all in all this game is hot ,hot trix,dunx,lay ups,everything is hot and anyone who thinx about getting it and is curious about getting this or something else should get ballers and see y people think its so good (...)."
2,THIS GAME IS SO DANG ANNOYING,"oh my god midway what is wrong with u? u always have trouble make good games. its a good idea : 1v1 with nba players. All it is, is takeing the ball and going to the hoop to dunk WOW WHAT EXCITMENT. The shots u take will NEVER swish. Always some stupid way of it bouncing around the rim. AND THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS GAME IS IN THE 3RD SET WHEN U HAVE TO DO A ""BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE"" omfg this is annoying and impossible. getting ur trick poionts up to a certain number. and IF the other opponent does a trick u loose points. its stupid cuase it will take hours to do tricks and actually get ur bar up because u have to go about 15 striaght times without ur opponent scoring. Have questions im me on yahoo at Ujio_Last_Samurai or aim at kilik_327"
4,OFF THE HOOK,Look if you don't have this game you are straight up wack.the graphics were of the chain. You have to get this game right now. If a store don't have this game something is wrong. This blows the top off of NBA Street and any other game. All you people who think they a baller younot a baller until you get this!
4,NBA Ballers is off the HOOK!!!,This game is the best. Especially the customising. the online tournaments are very hi-tech and amazing. The idea for online tournaments was genious since you can play somebody around the world and not have them come over your house or you come over their house. this game is better than Street 1 and 2.
2,okay,this game is pretty fun in the beginning. throwing alley-oops to your self and passing to someone in the crowd. but after a while its gets boring because its not realistic at all. renting it once is good enough.
5,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER,"This is the coolest game in the world. The &quot; Rags To Riches &quot; mode is awesome, and the dunks are insane. I love basketball games like NBA Live 2004 ( great game as well ) but this game is just pure talent. The create a player is &quot; Off The Hizzle &quot; ( move in the game ) anywayz, just wanted to say: Midway you made the best video game for years to come!"
2,Cheesy and Gimmicky covered in bling,"Imagine NBA Street Volume 2, only you replace the guy who thought up all of the style and flow of the game with the corporate exec who thought up the ""i'm lovin it"" ad campaign.The one-on-one game play with the same few characters that are in the game is fun at first, but gets boring quickly. The tricks, the style, the gameplay...nothing is nearly as good as NBA Street. To cover up the cheapness of it all, they slap ""omg bling bling"" all over the place with a unimaginative soundtrack. It's all of the same ""I'll play in the N-B-A, do a slam dunk, get rich 'cuz I'm a BALLAH"" lyrics over and over again with an irritating announcer on top.I really wouldn't suggest that you buy this game. Rent it first to see if you like it. Better yet, just buy NBA Street Vol. 2."
4,Durable,"Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas. Very durable and also sticks to any other magnetic surface like the refrigerator, (everything but the doll). She enjoyed them, but they should have designed this with a storage cover for housing all the pieces, a very durable wooden box but useless if the pieces are falling all over the place"
4,Love these!,My daughter got these for Christmas from her Grandmother- she loves them! They are durable and made well. We also love the wooden box they came in- only problem is there is no lid. Seems kinda silly to have this really nice box for them with no lid.
5,Magnetic Princess Doll,"Bought this for a little 3 year old who loves princess dolls! She absolutely loved this set, she can now change the dresses on this doll herself! Loves to match the dress to the hats and gloves that go with it. Perfect gift for this little girl!"
5,Easy to play with,Dress up is always fun. This is easy to pick up the pieces and keep them in the box.
3,"Very entertaining for kids, but one fatal flaw...","We purchased both this item as well as the other ballerina one; and we were very pleased with what we got! They are much cuter in person and come in a nice wooden box which is very nice ------ EXCEPT FOR ONE THING: It doesn't have a LID!!!!!!!! I find it unacceptable that a toy that consists basically of small parts, for kids, can come in a nice wooden FRAME, instead of a box. I was hoping that there would be at least a plastic lid of some sort, but not even that. Once you remove the plastic wrapping you end up with a wooden frame that serves no purpose.However, the girls LOVED the toy itself. Too bad that by the end of the day, half the pieces were already lost."
3,"Pretty, durable, what is that smell?","My 4 yr old daughter received this item as a gift for her birthday. We still cannot figure out why it smells like some kind of weird plastic! It makes the whole room smell; it's very odd. My daugher does enjoy playing with the toy, though. We are hoping the smell will dissipate."
3,magnetic dress up toy,"I thought the girls (8.6 and 4) would like playing with these. They didn't. Good durable toy, but got bored with it quickly."
2,not too happy,"First picture doesnt show it is a stand alone. I thought it was for the fridge. Not too user friendly for little hands. I bought three, also should have been marked 3-6, more clearly"
4,You Juggalos are seeing the PHAT SHXT!,"I am a really serious fan of ICP but I was held up by somem aXs monkey who stole my tickets to the concert so I couldn't get this seriously bXtchin' CD! But now ICP and Twiztid have released the CD for everyone to hear. I was close to givin up on ICP because of their recent excapades around, on their solo CD's and their 5 jpoker's card was weak! Dont take that the wrong way juggalos but ask your selves if you weren't also! But man this CD has restored ny faith in ICP along with the compltely bXtchin' DUMPIN CD which is also now available. I was afraid that I was going to have to bvuy each and every one of those new Pendelum CD's but UNHUNH This CD has them all on here so far! IN conclusion, buy this CD if you are a true juggalo, or be a juggahoe and steal it from a richy bXtch!"
4,Former Fan,"This is great album from ICP & Twizted, but it saddens me to hear people refer to The Amazing Jeckel Brothers as a good album. ICP's best album was Carnival of Carnage before they re-released it with two less tracks. After that the One disc version of Forgotten Freshness was best and also re-released with another disc, but two songs were cuts from the original as well. I'dd buy this cd because it was one of the last examples of what ICP used to be about. A true Jugalo would not be calling Jeckel Brothers or The Wraith a ""Good Album."""
4,Cosmic Ryde,"I have been listening to ICP since The Great Malenko. I'm going back and catching up now. I accidentally won this CD in an auction and it has been one of the best accidents I have ever wasted money on. Granted you to be a juggalo to truly enjoy the lyrics, but the rhythms are nice. It's great ""Chill"" music."
4,Must Have,Great industrial ep for the Wax Trax fan out there...find the Black Box for the Trent Reznor version of Supernaut!
4,Overlooked Industrial,"1000 (...)DJ's was a great industrial group; where did they go? it's too bad they only put out this one EP; would have been excellent to hear more from them as they developed, but i guess they got caught in the limbo of ""almost one hit wonders that never had that one hit."" Anyhow, i'd recommend it, even if it is just 4 tracks."
3,Uneven but at times powerful evocation of Sierra Nevada,"Clark's follow-up to City of Trembling Leaves and Ox-Bow Incident is an ambitious but not totally successful attempt at conveying the cold indifference of the natural world and man's supreme isolation in the universe. Often melodramatic, this tale of a clasically dysfunctinal family of ranchers living in the Sierra Nevada is most notable for one extended tour-de-force sequence: Clark's detailed, snowflake-by-snowflake description of a man's disorientation and eventual descent into madness as he tries to find his way out of a mountain blizzard. This harrowing section of the book may be justification enough for reading Track of the Cat."
2,"Horrible, just horrible",After the 1st level they count on the impossibility of the levels to make the game seem like it is longer. Bad trick.
2,o.k. game could be better,"This game stinks. Get spyhunter 1. The graphics are a little better than the first, but the only thing really better is the car. The only able to have two offensive weapons and one defensive is a bad concept. Having three levels that are boss based (train, plane, and the giant circle thing in the middle of the tundra) is a bad idea, you can't have the same level of expeirence then you can with several different enemies. There is supposedly supose to be more short cuts than the first for more freedom (look at ""the making of spyhunter 2"") but there is hardly any more than the first one. I strongly recommend renting the game before buying it."
2,Not nearly as fun as the previous version. It's a real letdown.,"The first one was so much fun and this one is a real disappointment. Everything is different in a bad way, game play, weapons, missions. Graphics may arguably be better, but not by much. Story line adding a chic is boring, these games have always been about the car. I'm not even going to bother purchasing Spyhunter 3 where the Rock actually gets out of the car.The bottom line is it's just not that much fun!"
3,basically the same game,"The reason this game is better from Sh1is because the car can turn into new things like a smowmobile. problem is that that only happens in snow levels andtheres not many snow levels.Multiplayer is the best part. But 007 games are still better than this one.Graphics: same as SH1.Gameplay: Same.Music: Worse than SH1.Difficulty to beat: Same.Overall: Not bad, multiplayer makes it better than the first one."
4,First Degree,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was not too difficult to figure out 'Who done it', but the development of the main characters makes one want to read more about Andy Carpenter and his friends. I look forward to reading more of David Rosenfelt's novels."
4,I enjoyed this book very much!,"This series is a great series. This book has everything in it I like. A good story, great charecters, humor and mystery. I would definitly recommend this book to a friend."
1,SPECIAL PRICE???,WHAT'S UP WITH THE PRICE OF THIS BOOK?? DID ANYONE NOTICE WHAT WAS ON THE COVER?SPECIAL PRICE...$4.99. MY RATING IS SOLEY DUE TO THE PRICE ISSUES. I HAVE NOT READ YET.DOES ANYONE KNOW?
4,First Degree,Most writers are annoying when they try to interject humor in serious topics. Butis author had me layghing out loud from time to time while I still remained intensely involved in his story.
4,Very enjoyable.,"Great characters, dialogue and courtroom scenes are the strength of this book. Having grown up in Jersey (New Jersey, that is), I love books set there. I did figure out the bad guy farily early, so that was a slight weakness. But this was a quick, enjoyable read, with a good plot, suspense and a bit more depth that his first book, ""Open and Shut."" I would, however, recommend reading the series in order."
4,Roll your eyes and smile,"I was tempted to make this a 3-star review but I enjoyed it enough to squeeze out a 4. The author does sarcastic smart-ass lawyer really well. That's fine for the first couple of chapters, but like syrup-drenched pancakes, you can only take so much in a sitting before you want something more substantial. I had to keep putting the book down. The plot is fast-paced if ridiculously implausible and the characters are mostly likeable if equally unlikely. Like most mystery writers without a legal background he gets almost everything in the law wrong -- lawyers objecting to the answers of witnesses (they move to strike), a state court judge issuing an order to the FBI to produce a file (never happen), and the FBI complying (really really never happen, take it from an ex-FBI agent) and an army Lt. Col. who can command state prison officials to make exceptions to their rules on visitors. The story will make you roll your eyes, but there will be a smile on your face."
2,Ho Hum,"I generally rely on the customer reviews I read and make my selection based on them - boy was I thrown on this one. Andy is NOT funny, the plot does twist - in knots! All I can figure out about Laurie is she's a good cook and has no problems sleeping. In addition to the people being totally uninteresting - the dog is as dull as dish water - and I'm a sucker for dogs! I'm on page 224 and intend to skip to 273 (the end) rather than endure anymore of it."
2,don't know what all the fuss is about,I'm confused by all the glowing reviews of this book. It's a so-so mystery. It was sort of funny in places but nothing to rave about. Won't be reading this author again.
1,"Good Subject, Bad Book","Chyna has an interesting story to tell, just not by Scott Edelman. While he writes well in his magazine, the book left a lot to be desired. There was not enough detail in this book to really get into Chyna's entertaining biography. In Warrior Queen, Edelman relies on old interviews, magazine articles, and video tapes for the subject matter. There hardly was any dialogue which made the book quite choppy at points. The writing style was extremely basic and rather boring, but fairly easy to read. Unfortunately, the brief trivia section at the end of the book was the best part."
2,Not a good book. An OK intro to the first lady of wrestling,"Remembering it is a slim paperback that will fit into your pocket, the best part of the book was the early years, and maybe some of the photos. The rest of the book, is a printed copy of the wrestling commentary you hear twice a week anyway. Don't get excited about the pre-surgery photos. There is only one good one. The other is just two bodies mid wrestle. It could be anyone.Save your money for something else, her new book perhaps?? Or paying for a pay per view episode."
3,A look before Playboy!,This is an OK book about Chyna/Joanie Laurer. I think the best thing is the pre-WWF photo's of her. It's amazing to see how different she looked before all the plastic surgery. A far cry from the picture's you see in Playboy now.
4,Kind of small,"I guess I didn't realize how small they were when I ordered them, they're studs. My girlfriend loves them though. So... I don't think the size matters."
5,Great Gift!,"I bought this for my dad, and he encourage me to read it! I'm not a Military buff or History for that matter, but this was a very interesting book that captured my attention! Great adventure story!I highly recommend this book to anyone!!!!"
3,A simplistic overview of research culled from many texts,"The book is a simplistic overview of 13 egyptian gods. About 2-3 pages are devoted to each god. The author for the most part simply consolidates research for the reader in an easy to read, ""spoonfeeding"" format. She includes bits of the myths and texts from the Book of the Dead. I wouldnt use it as a prime source of information but it offers some nice tidbits and images. The information about the author's practices seem a bit out of date as her temple no longer seem to exist."
1,Amateurish,"This book is very amateurish. If I am going to pay for a book of this sort, I want something with some substance to it. Wouldn't recommend this unless you have money to burn."
1,Colouring book?,I have no idea why I bought this. I really don't like it. The art is bad ... really bad.
5,Definitely recommended,"This book has helped me significantly both as a teacher and as a person. Some parts are a little overemphasized, and she's not always consistent in presenting people as composites of many styles, but the information is basically sound. As a non-Christian and a liberal, I consider it one of the few good things to come out of Focus on the Family."
3,uninspired,"Dreary compendium of IR info, specs and formulas. Limited insight or inspiration. The historical perspective is interesting -- does help understand how terminology evolved from scanned single detectors to staring arrays."
4,Comfortable and Secure,My Glock 30SF fits perfectly in this holster. The only thing I do not like is that the holster sometimes get stuck on my pants when using the paddle holster.
5,Durable As Hell,"I did not realize how durable the holster was until my brother accidentally sat on it when we were switching out the belt loop holster for the hip holster. Sadly, I don't have my Walther P99 to put in the holster yet, but I'm sure it will fit just fine. Great product"
4,great,"I use this holster with my glock 19. Fits like a glove. pistol slides into place with an audible click. Seems to hold very securely. When you push the release button, your trigger finger is conveniently in the proper place outside the trigger guard. Have mostly used it with the paddle adapter for concealed carry, but it also comes with a belt loop adapter. lightweight, comfortable. Can be integrated with a blackhawk tactical leg harness."
2,Problems with holster,"Great idea, poor execution. At least that's been my experience. I used the paddle option for a CC @ belt line. Within 15 minutes it was broken. Not broken in, like when you practice the draw with an empty magazine, just broken. As in retaining pin fell out, spring went somewhere downrange, and pressing the trigger release button gets you nothing.The quick fix is to super-glue the pin back in AFTER you have ground off the retaining nub that sticks into the trigger well. Sound like a good experience to you? It works, but only as a LEVEL 1 (no retention). I'll see if I can get another, but I'm not sure why I'd want one. Take your time researching this holster, and all BLACKHAWK SERPA system products. Some ranges won't let you use BH SERPA holsters. Too many self inflicted wounds. Which ought to tell you something.Google this:blackhawk serpa issues. Definitely NOT for the noob shooter."
2,wrong item,"they sent me the wrong item i asked for the carbon fiber 5"" holster i got a plain black 4"" holster. then they say too bad you have to wait . even tho i ordered it in proper time allowing them to ship it. i waited forever and got the wrong item. so i had to go to a competition with the wrong holster"
1,Holster is garbage !,"This holster was terrible guns sits loose and rattles around constantly, and to top it off holster broke within 2 weeks."
4,Auto lock not as good as it seems,I shoot a lot and have a bunch of guns. After taking this holster with a sig 226 to a combat training exercise I decided to sell it and get the version without the auto lock retention system. Why? While the super secure retention seems like a good idea in theory the extra time you will spend removing the gun in a real tac situation may cost you your life. I can almost guarantee you that in a stressful situation you will not hit the small release button right away.
4,Pretty good holster,"I bought this holster to use with the shoulder holster rig. The rig sucked, but I liked the holster, so I kept it and sent the shoulder rig back. I like the belt mount as shown, adjusted for maximum height. With the paddle mount attached, the holster tends to stick out and hangs a bit low for most of my prefered jackets. If you like a paddle rig, I recommend the Fobus HK-1 for your SR9. It rides higher and tighter and for me, I found it to be more flexible and comfortable. I found that the width of the paddle that came with the Bkackhawk relegated it to only one spot on my hip which was reasonably comfortable for standing/walking, but not optimal for sitting or driving. Due to the excelent retention/release system, I think this would be an outstanding holster for external tactical applications. Also, for those of you that have an SR9C, you can cut off an inch or so of the holster to get better concealibility without affecting the integrety of the holster."
3,Beretta 96A1,"I've been looking for a holster for my Beretta 96A1 for a month now and blackhawk is certainly the way to go. But this holster doesn't accomodate the accessory rail. The gun just dones't fit at all. I sent it back for a quick refund. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be many options for this firearm. Some people are suggesting get the glock 21 holster and file it a bit. I ordered a fobus holster... its okay, its passive retention but hard as heck to draw from. It doesn't seem practical."
5,Glad I spent the money,"Excellent purchase! Would recommend to anyone. Was not able to find fit for sigma, but after reviewing forums, found that M&P; fit Sigmas.Fit is excellent, adjustable screw controls retention. Comes with adapters for Belt or Paddle (outside pants) carry."
1,Lying,I ordered a left handed holster and received a right handed holster. When I contacted the company they said because left handed people wear the holster on the right (this was a christmas present I took their word for it). Not true! my son-in-law wanted a left handed holster. I don't like to order on line and not receive what I want.
4,"Taurus Judge w/2"" chamber & barrel","Just wanted to say real quick that this is pretty kick-ass with the Taurus Judge!Mine has a 2"" chamber, and I believe that is about the length of the barrel as well.Doesn't stick out at all. The retention button is simple to use and works great.I snapped this guy onto Blackhawk's thigh rig, and it's perfect for anyonewanting to show off that amusing, and big-ol Judge!Happy shooting!"
5,Great,Over all its great and this is hard to find with this price and for h&k p2000. Get it while you can.
4,feels good,"this holds my sp2022 very well, i like how when i am active it does not pop out. it you have a flashy piece this is not a good holster for you as it scrapes the side of your pistol"
5,MCK,I use this on a daily basis it holds my firearm secure and is comfortable to the point you hardly know you're carrying it and the p95 is a good sze gun.
4,Nice concealable retention holster.,"Nice retention for a concealable holster. If using this holster for concealment, I do believe for this model that the PADDLE will conceal a bit better than the belt method. Nice concealability for a OWB holster. Beware of the retention screw, do not tighten too much. I haven't been able to get these holsters very tight at all, at a certain point the screw will drive itself through the plastic and ruin your holster. Although Blackhawk is pretty good and offered to replace the product even though I didn't buy it directly from them and had it some time with no proof of purchase. I still prefer a leather holster though."
3,not for all 1911's!,"I noticed that this holster was for all 1911and clones. I already have one for my Taurus 24/7 and love it so this was a no brainer. So here's the fine print. Nowhere does it state that it will not fit a 1911 with a 5"" barrel and railed. Unfortunately, this is what i have. It's a great holster but buyers beware."
5,Fast,Exactly what I wanted. Holds my duty weapon exactly as I wanted. Better than eBay. Better than waiting in line at a brick and mortar store then paying wayyy too much for the same item.
4,Very Nice,The holster is exactly as advertised. it works perfectly and is more adjustable than I expected. Very well built and adds a little safety
5,Highly Impressed,I've had this holster for about 2 weeks now and I am thoroughly impressed. I didn't even need to adjust the retention amount on it either. A MUST have for all LEO's.
5,Chief's Review,"Very secure and once I got used to the button to release the pistol, it is as fast as not having one."
4,The devil's in the details,"I like the Blackhawk Serpa holsters, but this one is advertised as being for a Taurus Judge with a 3"" barrel. What the seller (and Blackhawk) fail to mention is that this is for the Judge with a 2 1/2"" chamber. The Serpa lock system will not engage the trigger guard if you have the Judge model with the 3"" chamber. This is a really good holster, but be aware of the difference in chamber dimensions and don't buy this if you have the 3"" chamber."
3,Oversize For Sub Compact,"This holster is well made and does have the advantage of including both belt and paddle type attachments. However, the PX4 sub compact model pistols do not go all the way to the end of the holster meaning that for sub compacts, it is almost 2 inches longer than necessary. If you are planning on using this for concealment of a sub compact model,there may be better options out there. I am keeping it for use with my full size PX4."
4,Fantastic,"This is one of those products that begs the question: ""why didn't anyone think of this before"".... operation is flawless and by nature of it's construction you withdraw the weapon with your trigger finger right where it should be (in safe position) ... my only regret is that they don't make one of these type of holster for all my handguns."
3,"Does not ""fit"" all 1911s","Holds a 1911 very tightly. Will NOT let it go at all unless the release catch is pressed. Take a leather holster, ala my Yaqui slide, and hold the gun upside down in it and it will let go of the gun after extended use. These will not. However, that being said, these holsters only fit the FULL SIZE 1911s. My Commander model does not fit the holster completely. The holster is made for a full length slide and there is a full inch of space between the end of the barrel and the bottom of the holster that is just empty. Returned it to the store where I got it. It is made very well and does exactly what the manufacturer claims it will do. Just be aware that it will not perfectly fit all sub-models of a particular gun or gun family."
4,Love the SERPA lock system,I love the SERPA lock system but I thought the holster came up higher on the gun than it did. Should have ordered the version with the site protectors. Still a great holster though.
5,awsome dvd.,this is a great movie it has lots of great songs from the burnin' up tour and special guests demi lavato and taylor swift who's songs were good as well! the jonas brothers are awsome!
3,Cheap price for an even cheaper release,"Pros:-Each movie only cost around $2.50 if you get this for the right price.-To my knowledge this is the only way to get Hellseeker on blu ray at this time.Cons:-All four movies have been compressed onto the same disc, this will almost definitely have a negative effect on picture quality.-Only one of the four movies has surround sound, the other three are left with 2.0-No special features-No separate menus, just an initial screen that has you select between the four movies and then they start up as soon as you choose.Bottom Line:If your able to get this set for really cheap ($12 or less) and your looking to own these movies just for the sake of one day owning all the Hellraiser movies, then I say pick it up. However if you seriously liked any of these movies your better off getting individual releases because the lack of surround sound and special features may be a deal breaker."
2,"More Relative Mathematical Snobbery for the ""Advanced""....","The book is okay for a relatively advanced practitioner. For a relative novice to TS analysis, there are far better books. Don't waste your money with this one if you are relatively new to TS analysis."
4,The idiots of finance,"One thing of interest here is non parametric methods and PCA in the context of finance. If you understand what this means you should read this book (If you don't see the title of this review). The basic tests for autocorrelation and randomness may even prevent you from getting fired. Unless you're able to quickly change the subject to sports and drinking, subjects more useful to your average Wall Street trading dim wit."
2,The book is not very good,"I am not satisfied with this purchase. First, it is not shipped very quickly. And I've seen many blank pages in the book which is very inconvenient."
5,Who doens't like this button,Everyone love the easy button - it works at that very moment when you want to be sarcastic and toot your own horn. We use it all the time at work!
5,Easy Button,This item was such a fun purchase and it's getting alot of laughs. It was a very good purchase.
5,A hit with my 13-year-old,"Gave this to my 13-year-old for Christmas and it was a big hit.He uses it for instrument practice and homework. When he completes something, he hits the button. Whatever it takes!"
2,These are $5 at Staples....,They have these in the Staples store and online for $4.99 - why on earth would anyone pay $25 for it?
3,WARNING: THE POSTED REVIEWS ARE FOR ANOTHER RECORDING,"Both of the reviews here are posted also for the Orbelian recording. This MP3 Download is for a completely different, older Bolshoi recording with an entirely different cast."
4,Attention all juggalos this CD is PHAT!,"Hey what's up juggalos? This CD is the fxckin bomb! Man they sound phat as hell while they are on those bootlegged beats man was this CD ever kick axs! I got this CD at the concert but now that they are releasing it on an actual distributing company I dont know if they changed anything, but whatever they did could not make this CD bad! I am forever a juggalo peacew out mother fxckers!"
4,Not Bad At All!,"In this album they took all the beats from different music artists. I recognized the Cypress Hill beats like on Slug N Ya Noggin, Who?, and Back To Crack. But it still kinda Kix A$$! Only 5,000 Made so hurry up... Get one and get gone."
4,this cd is fresh!,"this cd is pretty phat It's not the best but I like it the best song is track 1 ""Dumpin""!"
4,good... I should say.,"I was lucky enough to find a copy of this CD. I'm sure alot of people realize it's rather Rare. Anyway, I keep a close eye on my copy. It's good, not their best, personally I think that's ""The Amazing Jeckle Brothers"" but hey everyone's allowed their oppinion."
3,starting point,"This is my first exposure to this artist as a leader. Joshua Redman, who's featured on this work is of course a monster.Overall, for me, I believe that the work presents a good starting point but I would have wished, given the talent on board, that the work would have pushed the boundaries, and especially given we're talkin organ here, pushed the boundary in terms of groove. The first piece on the work I believe did push it, but after that it bogged down for me."
5,Read This Book,"This is one of the most important books I've ever read. It is of interest, of course, to people involved with literature, music, translation, or who are interested in Kafka, Picasso, Hemmingway, Stravinsky, or others Kundera talks about. But I think the real importance of this book applies to any reader. It has to do with Milan Kundera's beautiful illustrations as to how we as humans try to make our own heroes everyone else's heroes, too, and in the process destroy many of the things we value and love about them. This is a vital idea in the modern world, where celebrity, biography, and voyeurism are always so present. Also, the statements Kundera makes on the nature of friendship inspire deep reflection on the qualities of our relationships with those we hold dear."
2,"Nice Beatles' history, but nothing new","Since there was no description or editorial review for this item, I purchased it thinking it may contain some until now unknown recordings of the Fab Four. If you are about to do the same... don't! This is simply an audio book with the Beatles' history in about an hour. It is nice and probably very good for someone just getting to know them, but for the true fans there will be no revelations since all the material has been covered before. And there is also no music by the Beatles whatsoever, though there are a few audio clips of interviews with them (which you have already heard). There is a single Beatle-like backtrack that repeats throughout the reading, but that is as much music as you will get out of this CD."
4,Dorothy Sayers always delights,"Peter Wimsey has finally wed his true love, Harriet Vane, and they are off to Talboys, the home he has bought for her in the neighborhood in which she grew up. They arrive unexpected by the house, and Bunter rises nobly to the occasion, and, in Bunter fashion, continues to rise nobly as more and more peculiarities emerge and...and...more would be telling! Great characters, good plot, continuing story...what more can you ask for?"
5,end of the line,I adore Dorothy Sayers and have read them all. The romance between Lord Peter and Harriet Vane shows up in several titles but this one is culmination of them all with a honeymoon. Of course this is accompanied by a dead body and a mystery all making for a most satisfying read.
4,A Love Story With Detective Interruptions,"Summer 2004 Reading List - Mini ReviewI was intrigued by the premise of this book: An accomplished detective and a famous mystery writer marry, only to discover a corpse in the cellar of their recently purchased home the day after their wedding.This book is subtitled ""A Love Story With Detective Interruptions"" and lives up to that billing. I had not read any of the previous books in the Lord Peter Wimsey series but I did not find this an impediment. Sayers did a good job of making Busman's Honeymoon accesible as either a stand alone novel or part of her Wimsey/Vane story line. I so liked the characters that I am going to try to read previous installments in the series."
3,Busman's Honeymoon,"The mystery, as always with Dorothy L. Sayers, was good but not being a linguist, I didn't appreciate the amount of french that was included."
5,Too bad it wasn't made into a movie,"This would have been a great addition to the Dorothy Sayers series shown on PBS. Her stories are engaging, well written, CLEAN, and carry you right along with interest right to the last page."
5,Sayers at her best.,"This is my very favorite Peter Wimsey mystery -- a true novel. Nothing like a brilliant and insightful writer when she uses her talents for a mystery. I'm sure she could and did write in many venues, but I'm glad she chose mysteries."
1,Itchy and poky,This bra (and 2 other Warner's bras I bought at the same time) had something that poked me right near the clasp. I had to return them as they were so uncomfortable. It had something to do with the vertical whip-stiching instead of horizontal I think.
5,My favorite MLWTTKK offering,"TKK has gone through quite a change since their early days. Personally I stopped listening to them after Sexplosion (a bit too cheesy for my tastes) and I have to rank this at the top. The title track is my favorite, but I think the whole CD is top notch. All the songs have crazy movie samples. If you like Front 242 I know you'll love this. For those who like TKK's later stuff give this a try too. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,NBA JAM,"greatgame,greatpriceif you are thinking about buying this game buy it you want be disappointed"
2,Disappointed...,"As a longtime fan of the Jam series I expected this one to be a return to what I liked about the old-school arcade classic. Unfortunately poor controls and shoddy graphics ruined my experiance, The players don't move like I expect them to. I have to give them some credit for trying but it seems they didn't try hard enough."
3,"Has some good songs, but overall it's uneven and merely ""ok"" - for electronica fans only","Adult's ""Anxiety Always"" has promise, but it just doesn't deliver. They try to be as creative as possible, but what they do is create unlistenable and unsatisfying songs. Not to mention that whoever the female vocalist is needs to work on her style (it's not horrible, but it's just not that good). The electronic style is essentially just very fuzzy guitars with some blips, bloops and samples thrown in every now and then. Overall it feels uninspired and not very interesting. The lyrics are especially pretty dull. Only electronica fans would like this, but even they would be disappointed. It's not the most horrible thing I've ever heard, though; it's just ""ok"". Not recommended.Highlights include:""Shake Your Head""""Glue Your Eyelids Together""""Blank Eyed, Nose Bleed""""Nothing Of The Kind""""Nervous (Wreck)"" (parts of it)""Kick In The Shin"""
3,"Definitley a departure, but not a total failure","As the Electro movement gained popularity towards the end of 2002, Adult. got tired of the electro scene and wanted to head into harder post-punk territory. While Anxiety Always isn't bad, it doesn't have the hooks and grooves of Resuscitation. The Cold Call sounds like an unusally listener friendly Throbbing Gristle cut, while Glue Your Eyelids Together could be some 25 year old post-punk anthem. The vocals are highly affected and delivered in a serious-as-a-heart-attack style which is often unintentionally amusing. All in all it's not bad, but it's not a non-stop hard electro dance party."
4,"Retro, but not redundant.","I'm thrilled to see that a record company had the guts to release this. Excellent use of analog synths and strange sounds. Might remind you of the best aspects of 80's bands like Nitzer Ebb, Devo, Soft Cell, etc., but Adult.'s sound is still fresh. I'm actually quite fond of the vocal style used in most of the tracks here--fairly monotonous, but edgy enough to not become dull or grating. Can't get ""Kick in the Shin"" out of me head. Highly recommended."
3,some good sounds and some really annoying singing,"I like the primitive, 80s electro sound. Everything is tinny and metallic in a nice way. But wow, this is some of the most annoying singing. Her phrasing is totally amateurish, which is sometimes charming, but sometimes it just grates. A mixed bax."
2,monotone + synth,"Certainly not my cup of tea. So you'll know what to expect: 808-era drum machine, synth keyboard (square, triangle and sine waves--not much more complex than that), and monotone female vocals. My speaking voice is less monotone than hers. The lyrics are more interesting than the music; they kind of remind of the pixies due to references to violence / mutilation. If this sounds like something you would like, by all means check it out. I prefer more complexity and more melody, personally."
4,I THINK MAMA MIA ALBUM WORHT BUYING .,THIS ALBUM IS FIRE YOU KNOW ANYTHING COMING OUT THAT TANK IS BOUND TO BE WORHT CHECKING OUT.
1,This CD had nothing that I liked on it,When I buy a CD of Mia X I would like to have Mia X. On the CD a little more then she was. I liked Her CD called Unladylike better then this one
1,Oy!,"I'd rather watch some little old lady bump her artificial hip to ""Whoomp! There It Is!"" at a wedding. Pass it up unless you're a G or a wigger."
2,Not exactly the hottest female rapper about.,"Mia X has gone through master p's school of make bad albums but make lots of them. this album really fails to hit the spot comprising weak raps (except snoop, mystikal and silk) and even weaker production. the best song is 'imma shine' so if you have napster get that but whatever you do do not buy this. if you're gonna buy a no limit soldier's album get any of mystikal's or snoop- NOT THIS!!"
3,the most powerful voice in gangsta rap denied her due title,"out of all the rappers today or ever none can lyricaly captivate like MIA X. she is the hardest female for sure and better than any male i've heard except for probably TUPAC. u can read all the other reveiws and figure out which songs are the best but for somme reason everyone has seemed to over looked the track ""Ghetto Liven"" it is tragically poetic. MIA X we love u so much we been waitin for your next album for about 3yrs but u just take care of yours we'll wait till the last day for you unmatched skills."
3,THIS CD IS ALRIGHT,"THIS CD IS ALRIGHT, NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE LAST ONE. THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE GOING BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA WITH SOLDIER SONG ON TRACK NUMBER 1 AND HAVING MORE PEOPLEON THE ALBUM, BUT ONCE AGAIN THEY RUSH THIS ALBUM AND DROPPED IT TO FAST TRACKS 2,4,5,6,10,11,12,13,14,,15 ARE ALRIGHT, TRACKS 6, AND 11 ARE THE BEST, TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK."
2,Mia-x no limit soldier or not?,sorry to all no limit fans if you wanna hot album by a no limit mc get mercedes even tho she dosent rhyme always she still got more skills than mia i usually like mia but this album i dont listen to to much
1,"nifty toy, misleading advertising, one poor design element","I bought this product for my kids as a bath toy. It does work, and work fairly well. I have two problems with this item:1) The write for this item is misleading. Although I guess I should have read the ENTIRE amazon page of information regarding this item. The title says ""Wet-Ski and Submarine"" but you get only one OR the other, NOT both. Secondly, lower in the page it says ""Assorted wet-ski or submarine mini R/C."" which implies that there is no customer choice as to which item you receive.2) The item itself is pretty cool, but the rubber plug that is removable to protect the charging plug in hole on the water toy is difficult to put back on after charging it."
1,item not received,"i ordered this wall scroll for my grandson ,but he did not get it. they sent him cards instaed!"
1,Absolutment Boring,"Hoping for something akin to the fun, peppy tunes we all enjoyed in the TV series, I grabbed this so-called ""soundtrack"" to a French AbFab rip-off . Even the French admit it was a miserable attempt to capture the fun and spirit of the British series. The soundtrack is mostly pop-schlock and old standards. Ho hum. There is a handful of original soundtrack source music, but except for the pleasant ""Champagne Champagne (slow version),"" it's all variations of the same low-tech techno and it all sounds drearily alike. And nowhere is there even a variation of the beloved ""Wheels on Fire"" theme. Save your Euros, sweetie darling."
1,Horrible!,Though this beautiful braclet does look amazing it was made horribly!I wore this one day and by the next day it broke right in half! if you want to get a braclet like this go to Kohls because I gotA new braclet just like it from there and it's ten MILLOIN times better than this one!
5,I Was There,Hard to believe it's been this long ago. I was there for the show at Gruene Hall on Independence Day (Texas that is) in 1996 when Chris brought down the house. I've even got my picture inside the CD cover. Magical times; great music; and the true spirit of the Texas Honky Tonk.
4,"For all I know, you're a highway man...","I first discovered this movie in a stack of VHS tapes in a dark corner of my brothers house back in the early 2000s. After getting through a pretty intense opening scene involving the eunuch initiation process, the movie gets right into action starring Don Wong. Like with most 70's martial arts movies, either you love'em or you hate'em. I loved this movie right off the bat, the dubbing was classic, great costumes, a white-haired villain, and it also stars Lo Lieh portraying the ""warrior sage"" role. Unlike most Kung Fu flicks, there are a couple of beautiful Asian ladies who help led the fight against odds. Except for a few twists that don't seem to make sense, but that just adds to the nostalgia of the genre, it's a cult classic. It really has it's own unique flavor that separates itself from the pack, with a ending that just leaving you begging for more! Glad to see it finally on DVD.MoPop"
2,Not very tasty,"Like a lot of other brands of ""healthy"" noodles, these were not very good. Kind of grainy tasting. I don't find this texture with Barilla whole grain pastas."
3,good if you know how to read chinese,"I am just a beginner in Chinese language so my level is low!!!This book is ok to have reference about some words and how to read them. Anyway, if you are a beginner do not buy it ,but if you know some chinese specially chinese characters then , you can buy this book."
4,Well worth the money for most skill levels,"I could not put this book down! It has a very clear writting style and is full of color examples which help drive the point home, and the humor is an added plus. One of the best points is that Ben Willmore doesn't waste half the book on the basics (although he spends enough time to make it understandable for beginners), and spends ample chapter time on several of the more complex aspects of this program. This book improved my skills and cut the time I spend creating images more than enough to justify the cost."
5,fantastic,Hands down the best Photoshop book I've read. Useful information & great tips and tricks in an easy to understand format. A must have for any Photoshop 5 user.
5,Official Adobe Photoshop 5.0 Studio Techniques,"I received this book at a 3 day seminar put on by Ben (of which was, by far, THE best seminar that I have ever been to). My copy of this book looks like it has been through the ringer simply because it is the only reference book that I use anymore. It is a MUST HAVE for any level Photoshop user."
3,It's a decent Photoshop book,"This book is not disappointing. It is not the ""greatest ever"" by no means either. It is written in a nice, down-to-earth manner, which will make beginners at ease.I do have to confess that I didn't install the accompanying CD, so I can't say anything good or bad about it. The good points of the book are that it does teach some very useful tricks. (His chapter on shadows and text effects is almost worth the money alone). For the people who intend to go into graphic design and are going to use Photoshop relatively frequently, the chapter on Selection tools is a must, because these are one of the most used features of the program, and he did a great job of covering them. The book is fairly priced too and you will get your money's worth. I'd say buy it, the book is adequate but it shouldn't be the one and only book that you have for Photoshop (if you make a living with the program, that is)."
1,Uh -- definitely not the best.,"You know, it is really hard to stomach the obsequious tone of some of the reviews for this book. This book is neither comprehensive or especially easy to follow. Some of the methods are useful but most of the material is a rehash of material that is in every other Photoshop book and definitely not worth the price. I still feel rather stupid for paying the full price for this edition because I recently came across a Photoshop 3 book in a second hand store that covers much the same territory. Not recommended."
2,Studio techniques is too shallow!,"After reading some of the instructional texts on Photoshop after I bought this book, I found that as much as Ben Willmore claims that he did not want to write a ""Step by Step"" approach, the book is way too thin on the inner workings of Photoshop 5 to be of any real value. There are better texts out there that teach more of what's going on in the program. Plus, the include CD is useless ( nothing there to follow along with the sparse examples throught the book.)"
5,excellent movie,If you are planning a trip to yellowstone national park this is a good preview of you vacation.The grandkids loved this DVD & our trip to Yellowstone.
1,Not a good snack food,"Raisins are not a good snack for kids (or others). The sticky fruit clings to the enamel of the teeth, promoting tooth decay."
2,There are So Many Better Bread Machine Books,This book is very basic and standard. I found the other 3 bread machine books I ordered were better.
3,Not sure about these,Havn't tryed any of these yet but will soon. The recipes are well writen ans seem to be easy to follow.
3,Few too much...,"I bought three bread machine books at the same time, each has only a few good recipes, all three books could be combined and make one good book with a total of 10 good unique recipes. Each book seems to take one recipe and and one ingredient and call it another recipe. I could do that myself. If I was smarter I would have taken the book out from the library, and made notes on about three recipes from each book, and saved about 50.00."
5,DVD or BUST!!,"I understand the delay in bringing WKRP to DVD........with all that original rock and roll, the securing of rights for a different media must be a nightmare. However, Freaks And Geeks was recently released on DVD with ALL of its original music intact.......so c'mon MTM, let's get on the ball and get this nugget of a show ready for the next millenium. I guess we'll see the release on DVD when turkeys fly........"
3,Pool mom,I love magnets and wear them religiously and the reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because when you wear these little patches for me they were only good for about 1 time kinda like a bandaid you need to change and I didn't want the upkeep with that even though I liked that they were hidden. If they included a whole bunch of replacement patches then without a doubt they are worth it but until then I will have to stick to my magnetic jewelry especially seeing how I lost all my little magnets that came with this because I didn't order more stickers to hold them on and trying to use them more than 1or 2 times doesn't work! You will just have a sticker at the end of the day with no magnet if you work out or sweat alittle it just slides out.
5,This game is a real slap shot!,"This NHL game is a blast. I didn't like the previous NHL Hitz titles because of the larger-than-life players, only 4 men on the ice, etc. This latest version is a real improvement. Regulation 5 men on the ice, realistic player sizes, and lots of fun to play. I have tried all the 2003-04 NHL games and I enjoy this one the most.p.s., GO SHARKS!!"
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"The reason i always bought midway was because it was different then all the other hockey games, now that they have gone more realistic, there is no reason to buy this game. It seems Midway has turned their backs on their loyal fans. Save your money, buy nhl hitz 2003 which is alot more fun and entertaining then nhl hitz pro"
3,Oxford sheets need more heft,"I am still in search of high quality Oxford sheets. The Nautica sheets have skimpy fabric and small pockets. They are comfortable to sleep on, and they are warm. I like Oxford sheets because they aren't cold to the skin like percale. But these sheets will have a short life-span."
3,If you compare it to a Rockstar Game........,"If you compare this game to a title released by Rockstar Games like ""Grand Theft Auto Vice-City"" or ""San Andreas"" or ""Midnight Club"" you will definitly be disapointed. If I put this game in my PS2 following playing ""Vice City"" or ""San Andreas"" it seems like I am going 10 years back in video playing time. The graphics just aren't that great. The movement of the characters is not the greatest and the missions and storylines are well average at best. I bought this game because Bill Bellamy is on the soundtrack and the games concept sounded really interesting but I think Rock Star has set the standard so high for these kind of games I found it hard to really get into this one."
3,Play With an Open Mind,"This game was a lot of fun for all the wrong, distorted reasons. I was totally blown away by the drug use in this game. If GTA included this subject matter in their games, those people who object to this type of video game entertainment would go ballistic.They've got guts for putting out stuff like this. It's sick people like me who will continue to buy them and enjoy them, especially for such a cheap price."
4,Good CD but track listing on Amazon is incorrect,"The Platinum Collection actually contains 20 songs from Betty's stint on Atlantic Records (and not 16 as the Amazon description claims). The song ""Tonight's the Night"" does NOT appear on this CD, unfortunately. The Platinum Collection is actually quite good, but it does not include anything from the late 70's forward."
1,The Spaghetti wasn't the Only Thing Soaked!,"Whole-wheat pasta is better for you. However, this brand, Davinci is an absolute ripoff. It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz. To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box. This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!"
1,Read the ingredients...,"The second ingredient is ""flour"" - what kind of flour? Is this really whole grain? Is it really spelt? I won't be buying this product again."
4,nice,"I got the art teacher barbie that has the one kelly doll with it instead of two kelly dolls. It's a nice set, but I think Barbie should be dressed in what a real art teacher would be dressed in. Maybe jeans and a shirt. Most teachers nowadays don't dress in a dress like that. Most would wear jeans and a shirt or a long overall dress. Maybe a teacher in the 1960's would dress like this. Overall, it is a nice barbie though and the Kelly doll is cute."
3,not as good as you must remember this or we were the mulvane,"Although this work shows Oates in surprisingly good early form, her sentences don't have the rich roll of her later work. I feel had she written the same plot today, she could have accomplished it in fewer pages with much richer language. Also some of the more squalid details she could have presented with less shock value (See ""because it is bitter..."" for a great example of what I mean). She wrote this when she was only 30 and it gives every indication of the master she was to become. In my opinion, Oates is the greatest living female novelist in English."
1,Worst Novel Ever,"This has to be by far the worst novel I have ever read. The plot drags to the point where I nearly ended up in catatonic state like Maureen in the novel. I grew up in a Midwest working class neighborhood, lived in the Detroit area and worked for an automaker. While much of Oates story rang true, too much of it did not. Others have praised her story telling, I don't see it and have not picked up another of her novels since."
2,Them,I was assigned to read this book for my English Honors class. It was very painful. I have never read anything by Oates before. It was very difficult for me to get through the book because she left so many things hanging. Something happens and then you find yourself in another setting and what happened back there. My English teacher felt it was worth reading.
2,Oh man!,"This busted in half when I opened it! Wonderful novel, though. Wonderfully written novel, though. I bought a new one as to not read the busted in half one. I read all of the new one."
4,"Disturbing, yet enthralling","In this novel the characters seemed to be desperately trying to escape from each other, but unable to escape the past they share together. Joyce Carol Oates descriptions of the characters lives are vivid and oftentimes disgusting. The characters rarely seem to be able to make the right choices and are often victims of circumstance. Still, I was constantly intrigued during the novel. This novel is an excellent view of the sixties. Another wonderful novel by Oates is ""Because It Is Bitter and Because It Is My Heart,"" whih is set in approximately the same time period. ""Because it is Bitter..."" adds the aspect of race relations and has a more solid ending than ""Them."""
4,"Great Writing, so-so story","To read this book is a pure pleasure. The writing is amazing, descriptive but not so much that your imagination is constricted. The characters are so complex and well developed, it makes reading along with them realistic and enjoyable. However, this is one of those ""good"" books with a depressing plot. That's how I would describe it, depressing. Over the course of the book things just keep getting worse, and at the very end - well, I won't give anything away. If you're the type of person who likes to watch movies like ""Schindler's List"", extremely well done but emotionally taxing, then you'll love this book.One thing I was amazed at, however, was how Oates talked about things I have never before read in a book for school. She doesn't use any euphimisms, that's for sure. I suggest you read it, overall the writing and powerful emotions conveyed to the reader are far more amazing than anything else I have ever read."
4,Terrifically Melodic and Funny,"This 1982 release had catchy tunes and laugh-out-loud funny lyrics. Where else can you hear a dance song about moustaches (My Fu Manchu was real fine/My Ronald Coleman made 'em blink/My Pancho Villa made 'em think/But when I trimmed 'em real small/My Jewish friends would never call), Sherlock Holmes, Mickey Mouse, and the monster of love?Sound quality is excellent, and the CD includes the lyrics."
4,Heart on Fire,"It is a little dated but a nice sweet romance. My only complaint is the extended angst of the main characters. Love is love, it's rare and should be cherished."
4,Summer of Reading Lesbian Romances Continued,"I've got a pile of about a dozen books that I bought for Summer reading. This one was recommended for those that enjoyed Curious Wine (my favorite Lesbian Romance). I had read Diana Simmonds book Forty Love many years ago and re-read it at the beginning of the Summer, so I was already familiar with her work and the Austrialian Setting. I wasn't sure I was going to like this book as it first began, but then I found myself reeled in. After I was done I re-read it from cover to cover (which I'm finding myself doing with about all the books I've read this Summer ... including re-reading the really good parts over and over). What I wish for all the Lesbian Romances that I've read this Summer is that there is a sequal or the story continues after the pair finally realize that they have to be together. I always have to use my imagination after the last page to think of ""what's next for these two ?"""
4,An entertaining book.....,"The biggest obstacle this book faces is in the comparison of it to Curious Wine. I personally don't think there is or ever will be a better lesbian love story than Curious Wine, but standing on its own merits, Heart on Fire was a good read. I base my opinion on whether I finish the book in less than a few hours. It means I couldn't put it down, or didn't want to. Granted, being an English major I've learned how to read fairly quickly, but believe me, I usually savor good love stories. There are many books from Naiad I've bought, and there are some that I just couldn't even finish because it didn't grab me. This one did. Just one lesbian's opinion."
1,No Comparison!!,"I read ""Curious Wine"" one day then the next ""Heart on Fire"", and all I could say is that there is no way possible ""Heart on Fire"" can compare. ""Curious Wine"" was my first novel of this sort and boy talk about exquisite. I think I have read and re-read it about 3 times, in that week, while I've only read ""Heart on Fire"" once and then I skipped around--- alot. I guess the reason the story was not interesting was that the chemistry between the character's was not there for me."
1,All the same,"If you've read one Maclean book, you've read them all (outside of the very earliest). Same plot used over and over, no suspense, carboard characterizations--and way, way, way overwritten (the books are padded beyond belief--if he wrote cleanly they would be reduced by two-thirds). Maclean himself said that he hated writing, churned out a book in about a month with one draft, and it shows. The later you read in his bibliography, the worse the books get.Don't bother."
3,"A good, not great, mystery","I think the previous reviewer from California has this novel confused with some other book. I certainly wouldn't give Alistair Maclean's Bear Island to a small child and I'm not aware of any illustrated editions.The book in question does, however, feature multiple murders committed during a trip to the arctic circle. A group of filmakers are going to Bear Island (a snow covered wasteland) to make a new movie, but only the producer and screenwriter know what the script is. Poisonings and drownings give way to blunt instrument trauma as the cast and crew diminishes quickly. Only the film crew's doctor can investigate the mysterious occurences. Except he's not all he seems, either.I usually enjoy Maclean's writing and that's true here as well. The only problem I had with Bear Island was that it bogged down in the middle when the shipboard deaths had already occured and they still had not reached the island.All in all, though, a good solid read."
3,cute but too fabric is too thick,"Great idea. Love the tags. It would be better if one side of the fabric was lighter in weight, even a slinky fabric."
5,Well Made,"This Little Taggie ""blanket"" is very well made and our daughter loves it! I had seen these during pregnancy, and actually went looking for one when I noticed my six-month-old playing with the tags on her blankets. We are very happy with our purchase. The brand name is far superior to the ""knock-off's"" you see in department stores. The 12"" x 12"" is the perfect size for baby to play with and explore the different colors/textures/sizes of the tags while in the car seat on road trips!"
3,okay,"My daughter loves tags on anything, so when I saw this product I thought it would be perfect for her. It is really cute, and just like the picture. My daughter doesn't care for it at all. The tags are made mostly from ribbon and the pink blanket is rough and scratchy. If I were you I would save the $25 and get some soft washcloths or baby blankets with tags on them."
4,Good as a Gift,I purchased this as a gift and at the time there were no dimensions listed as there are now. I expected it to be a little bit bigger. However the baby it was purchased for loves it. He always has it with him and his mother is actually quite surprised at how much he loves it. She thought it was stupid when she opened it at the baby shower. She alternates this one with another Taggie that I bought for the baby.
2,quality not as good as past products,Quality not as good as past products.The blanket part of the item not soft and pilled after the first wash.Also some the tags were sewn crooked.
3,The blanket material is really hot (flannel),"The overall concept is great, and after a few days my daughter really warmed up to the idea of having a lot of tags to play with and chew on. My only criticism is that the blanket material is HEAVY flannel and extremely hot. I live in South Florida so this is not an item I can use everyday, especially on car rides. I believe it comes in other fabric options which I suggest you look into based on your own particular climate needs. If you live in a cold weather climate, this one would be perfect."
1,"needs to be much bigger,","MY DAUGHTER DOES NOT LIKE IT LIKE I THOUGHT SHE WOULD, SHES LOVES TAGS BUT THIS ITEM DOES NOT MEET HER STANDERDS, NEEDS TO BE BIGGER NOT WORTH THE PRICE, DO NOT GET THIS ITEM DOES NOT APEAR TO BE ALL WHAT IT MAKES OUT TO BE!!!!"
5,My son's prized possession,"We got one of these blankets with clouds on it when my son was an infant. Now at age 3 it has become a proper noun: Cloud Blankie. We bought a star version and it is simple not the same. So this blanket comes with a warning: you child will love IT .. the one you buy. Please keep track of it or heartbreak will ensue!That said, I buy these blankets for everyone I know who has a baby. They are simply perfect."
3,Taggie number 3,The fabric/felt on this taggie seems to be a lot less soft than the others we have had.Perhaps that is why it was $10 less than the others.It's still a sweet little taggie that the babes love :)
1,George S. Patton and Dwight D. Eisenhower,"I didn't like it at all. I like WW II history and thought that this DVD would be a classic. However, the format was 50ish and had no originality.I would not recommend this DVD to anyone."
4,like taking a class,I'm pregnant with my first baby. I was put on bed-rest and was worried that I would not be able to attend a baby care class that I signed up for. I bought the DVD as a back up but was able to attend the class anyway. I can say that this DVD covered just about everything I learned in the class but the class was twice the price. The DVD would have been a pretty good substitue afterall.
4,Nice value for glass decanter suitable for 1 bottle of wine,"I'm very satisfied with this purchase and am writing this to clarify a couple points I was uncertain of based on other reviews. This decanter is glass. The box claims it is ""mouth blown glass"". It is made in China. The photo in the description depicts it holding one full bottle of wine (750 ml). It does not drip when it pours (just one drop rolls off the lip much as what happens when you pour from a wine bottle). It is nice looking, though it wouldn't be mistaken for a $200 crystal decanter"
5,Gorgeous and easy to use!,"For those of us who enjoy inexpensive wines, this is a great decanter to allow them to air. The squat body keeps it from tilting over and the handle makes it easy to pour. You don't lose your grip on this one. It holds 70 ounces easily. Very nice. It's the perfect first decanter for a household. It would make a GREAT gift."
5,Oh Man!,"This is the album I should have bought first but I was a tool and waited two years and bought Angst. Not to take anything away from Angst mind you. I'm just mad at myself becase Money should have been the first in my huge Kmfdm collection. Oh well I have it now and boy is it good. Bargeld, Help us..., Vouge, and Sex on the Flag are the best tracks in my opinion. This is the first of Kmfdm's full length studio albums that anyone should buy."
2,KMFDM's worst,This album is a waste of time. Buy Retro or the singles. It'll save you money (no pun intended) and get you the best tracks on the album... (Not saying much)
5,An exemplary book about politics and economy in a Dutch town,"This book can be seen as a masterpiece. The story of Lille is not well-known, even if the sources are important and accessable, and that's why this study is of a great interest. As the title says, the book describes the economy and politics of the (now) french town of Lille, then one of the biggest towns of the Low-Countries. Robert S. Duplessis made very complete research and extended the use of the sources to their maximum. The result is astonishing, and very surprising. We can see the tension between catholics and calvinists, the difficulties of the relations between central power in Bruxelles or Malines and the ""Magistrat"" (the town's council), and the way money and birth regulate the power in town. If you are interested in politics, in the Reform, or in the way people made fortune in the Renaissance, this book will interest you."
3,Cheaply made,The part that actually does the work is not well finished... a few licks with a dremal makes the tool much more usable... I smoothed down the top to make it easyer to get back into the whole your cutting. Then smoothed the ridged sides to keep it from snagging.
5,"Great Tool, Second One",This is the second nibbler that I've purchased. The only thing that I do is use some silicon sealer to cover the handles so that it is easier to hold and I don't get blisters when cutting a large opening.
4,Face is bigger than I expected but overall a nice watch.,"I purchased this watch because I wanted something a little different and I like the copper/stanless steel band. When I received it, I had to double check and make sure I ordered a woman's watch. The face is a little big but I have grown to like it."
3,Hechizos para la Prosperidad (Spanish Edition),Here's another book my wife could not find. So far I've found everything she or I wanted on amazon.com. She uses this book (also) for reference and since she the one who's reading it I'll have to give it three stars. (Maybe if I read the book I might give it another review.)
3,Life Changing Book,"If you are serious about making some changes in your life, make this book by Dr.Mustin your best friend. The very first chapter will make you want to say "" I can do this"". Want to do something to treat yourself, BUY THIS BOOK, and watch your life start to change. Thank you Dr. Mustin for taking the time to put your expertise into helping others."
1,Ridiculous piece of self-flattery from a bogus author,"I am a licensed psychologist and have read several books that I would deem useful for my clients - THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!! For anyone seeking practical advice from a truly gifted therapist and author, do yourself a favor and pass this book by. Just read the cover and look at the picture and you will see that this book is not written for the purpose of helping others, but for self-promotion for an aging therapist. In addition, several of this author's ""credentials"" have been achieved through mail order training programs. For those of us who are truly invested in helping others help themselves, I would say keep your money and donate it to a more worthwhile cause."
4,helpful book,I was stuck doing the same thing over and over again. the contents of this book helped me immensely and i highly recommend it to anyone needing a push in the right direction to get out of the squirrel cage.
5,Brilliant!,"By far, the funniest book I've ever read. And I've read like 3 books. Jim Norton rocks my world!"
5,Thanks for the laffs caddy daddy,"Not only did I get a hilarious comedy DVD, I also received the AIDS virus. Thats right Jim Nordon gave me AIDS, he thought it was funny. I hope he's burning in hell."
5,HIV POSTIVE,Before i dwindled down to 89 lbs i used me and Lil'Jimmy used to go crusing the saturn looking for tranies.We would go bagless sort of a modern day Russian Rullette well Lil'Jimmy is on HBO and im shopping for belts in the boy section of sears...I guess i Won..HooHoo
5,"Ribless wonder comic shines in a ""Very Brady Comedy Special""","It is so sad today, on what would have been Lil' Jimmy's birthday was he still with us, to think about what could have been after watching this DVD in my satin robe. Jimmy's blubbering antics and lack of self-confidence reaches new heights in mediocracy. This 4 minute stand-up performance is reminance of that fateful night in the Mantown rest stop that got him banned from Mantown, and eventually banished 6 feet underground. Today I will be eating three steaming bowls of broth, one for me, and one for you Jimmy. Also one for my last T cell."
5,Rich Voss is sooooooooooooo funny.,"Hooray Hooray for the Stamp Licker Mr. James Norton. I just received my DVD and headed straight to the bedroom with some lotion for some quality Jimmy and I time. When the DVD was over I wiped myself clean with my girlfriends fathers T-shirt and went to my bathroom. I stared at myself in the mirror and had that creepy feeling like the first time you pleasured yourself with some help from Scraps. I didn't feel that way from all the fantasizing I had just had about Jimmy. I think it was from the 8 White Castle Clam Strip sandwiches and the 12 Rolling Rock nips I just drank. I'm not sure how I feel about this DVD, I just know Rich Voss doesn't deserve ANYTHING."
5,Mr Norton's show is phenomenal!!!,This dvd is awesome. As soon as I finished watching it I flushed it down the toilet and [......] my mother.
5,JIM NORTON IS A TOOL,"[ANGRY]JIM NORTON IS NOT FUNNY, THIS DVD IS NOT FUNNY. JIM NORTON THINKS HE IS SOOO COOL. HE THINKS FIVE CHILDREN BEING DROWNED IS FUNNY, HE THINKS PULLING THE PLUG ON A WOMANS LIFE IS FUNNY, HE THINKS AIDS IF FUNNY, AND HE THINKS BEATING A WOMAN IS FUNNY. THIS GUY IS A REAL SILLY GOOSE. I DONT LIKE HIM, MY VOICE NEEDED TO BE HEARD. EMAIL HIM AT EATABULLET.COM AND SHOW HIM YOUR DISAPPROVAL."
5,Lonely Man,It brought back some very good memories of some very good times. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone.
3,Silly but engaging,"The title of this episode is a bit obscure but the casting is absolutely brilliant! Having Warren Stevens playing a man without emotion and Robert Webber a being awkwardly learning about emotions, makes use of both actors limitations as performers. I love this series so I'm willing to overlook it's faults and simply enjoy the tale. Of special note is Get Smart's Chief Edward Platt then billed as Edward C Platt."
4,ha!,"i'm SHOCKED -- i haven't seen (let alone HEARD) this odd little album in probably 15 years or so. i remember buying it as a kid and loving it -- and the samples i just listened to still sound fantastic. i'm gonna buy it again and do a MEMORY LANE type thing, if you can dig that (i'll bet you can). AWESOME!"
2,Bloody Awful - Kimono was their peak,After they fired the English band they slipped to turning out this rubbish. Bloody awful. Kimno was great and the rest of the stuff they put out was fairly dreadful.
4,The beginning of the Change,"This CD marked the beginning of TKK's move from darkness to dance. Taken alone, this is a good CD. Sex on Wheelz found commercial success and the rest of the album, not taking itself seriously, sets you up for a fun trip. Fueled by sex and deviant behavior, this CD runs from S&M to alcohol. The music is good, as are the beats and it's good from end to end."
3,A KICK!,"I really get a kick out of listening to this album. It is an attempt to take advantage of shock-value, but the value just isn't there. However, if you listen with an open mind you find yourself really enjoying the silliness and such of the music. I can listen to this album over and over again for an energy boost."
4,"Groovy's voice! The sleazy, cheesy sexual content! super","i have owned this album for about 3 years and it just recently got stolen from me. i was heart broken. never has an album come out and equalled it in dancability. propably tkks 4th best album, but i don't have REINCARNATION OF LUNA. the main stand out on this album is GROOVY'S and the BOMB GANG GIRLZ' flawless vocals. it is not industrial, but hey it is the funnest album i have ever owned ! standout tracks are MYSTERY BABYLON, INTERNATIONAL SIN SET, CONTINENTAL TOUCH,LEATHERSEX,and SEXPLOSION!"
4,70's porn music,"On my first listen, this CD made me think of growing a beer belly with a lot of curly black hair growing out of it. I wanted to have several gold chains hung around my neck while doing the nasty to a few 20 year olds who look like 40 year olds. In other words, it made me want to be in a 70's porn.On the next listen it sounded even better. This is my first MLWTTKK CD, and it was not what I expected.If you're looking for dark/goth...maybe one of their other CDs is better for that. For what it is...I do like this CD."
4,Not for beginners!,"I agree with the previous reviewer this book is not for beginners. BUT what a book! The recipies are great, and presentations wonderful. The portions, sometimes serving 20 need to be reduced, and measures are in weight (took me a minute with 10 oz eggs). If you're a veteran baker you'll have a book that challenges-- and rewards with plenty of wow appeal at your next dinner party."
3,mad skills needed,"the pictures are amazing and i yet haven't tried any of the recipes, but i bet they would be lovely. it's not really how to make everything, but some of these things will take some talent to plate up. i haven't seen any books on plated desserts besides the one by this author so i took the plunge and got all 3. i am looking for a book more based on different techniques used. these books show u more rare unusual things, and not much teaching involved."
3,review on pastry,"I feel that this book didn't project the pastry that people are interested in today. Pastry is like a fashion show, you put your best most tasteful and fashionable out to the public. The fashion is not overpowered by the accessories.. The dessert should be able to project itself alone.. In this book the desserts were lost among all the garnish.."
3,no comparison to the 1st .... too far fetched,"i read bridget jones long before the movie ... loved bridget jones for it's originality and freshness; it got me hooked on english books of same genre .. looked forward to this 2nd release ... fun, light read ... too far fetched ... looking for good relationship books about ""singletons""? try marian keyes or lisa jewel .. both excellent, enjoyable authors who you can't put down and whose stories you won't forget"
3,Lackluster,"Although I was a fan of the first Bridget Jones, this simply retreads ground that Fielding covered in the first book. Where ""Diary"" had originality and wit, this book has nothing new to offer except for a degeneration into silliness. Bridget deserved better."
3,Bridget Jones-The Edge of Reason,"This book was ok and definitely not as good as the first one. I felt that it did not explain some parts as well and left you wondering ""what was that all about"". Some parts there was too much description about things you could have cared less about. Don't get me wrong though it was a fun book to read when it came to the funny parts and it did have a your typical good ending!"
1,v. disappointed with the sequel,"Nothing at all like the first book. What did she do, watch the Claire Danes movie and decide to put Bridget in the role?"
3,Lackluster plot with minimal comedic relief,"I must admit, after having read Fielding's first ""Bridget Jones"" masterpiece (during which I scared those hapless folk who happened to be in my vicinity with my side-splitting hyena laughter), Edge of Reason is a big disappointment. The plot is stale (too many Thailand drug bust themes running about these days) and the Jane Austin rip-off rendered events too predictable. On the whole, characters featured in this book were poorly developed and two-dimensional. Having said that, Bridget is still the enchanting neurotic figure we got to know and love a short time ago -- a mirror image of every woman living in a parallel universe. Edge of Reason is still worth a read, but don't have lofty expectations."
1,V. Terrible!,"The sequel to the first Bridget Jones book is as AWFUL as the first one was great. The first Bridget was funny, entertaining and above all....realistic. I would cite specific examples of the book if it didnt mean I would ruin it for others who wished to waste their precious time reading it.....The British lingo is often cute in these books, but this was outright ridiculous! Way over the top--If I hear the words snogging, shagging or of someone smoking another (...)any time soon, I might snap. With all the great books out there, PLEASE find a new one-- Let your Bridget Jones memory be a good one-- Remember the disappointing feeling you had after seeing the movie?? It didnt quite spoil the book--but this book will make you hate ever reading the first. (...)"
2,Amusing up to a point...,"Reading the first ""Bridget Jones"" book, I became increasingly annoyed with its heroine. I was hoping in the sequel that she would get a bit brains. Well, I was disappointed! While there are some laugh out loud moments in this book, I got fed up with Bridget's appalling stupidity and vapid self-absorption. The only reason I can think that a supposedly intelligent man like Mark Darcy would be interested in her is that it stokes his ego to be able to rescue her from her ineptitude and to be able to patronize her at will."
5,GOSH,"I had watched da movie before i read the book and at first i have to say i was confused because of all the slangs / diary format but as i got into it, i found the humour delighting and the start of it like how many cigarettes / alcohol and stuff really funny and I loved how everytime she was down in the dumps , the more angry she was the more funny she was for some wierd reason. It was kind of different to the movie though , the way it started and everything"
4,"Get a U.S. editor, please!","I thought this sequel was much funnier and better written than the original. Bridget comes off much more well-rounded, and one sympathizes more with her predicaments (especially her over-the-top obsession with Colin Firth!). Not surprisingly, I have always loved Persuasion as well.Number of times Hillary Clinton's name is misspelled in U.K. version of book, 1. Gaaah!"
3,Edge of my reason,"Well, the first book was a laught, but Bridget really does get a bit too dump for me. At her age I really expected her to have a bit more reason, and common sense. Her lack of straight forward thinking drove me up the wall in different parts of the book, and her friends became more of a nausance than a support system for her, driving her in all the wrong directions. I really had very high expectations for this book, and I have to say that allthought I enjoyed parts of it, all and all it was a drag to read."
4,Even funnier than the first one,"I discovered the much touted Bridget Jones books very recently. The first one had me in stitches and this, the follow-up, is even funnier. The trials and tribulations of this neurotic 30-something year old are hilarious. You can identify with all her insecurities and yet laugh at the situations she puts herself into. I couldn't put this book down and it will be one I reach for anytime I need a good laugh. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
3,Not so much...,I really enjoyed Bridget Jones's Diary and was looking forward to the sequel. The Edge of Reason seemed to follow the same rules as movie sequels - not as good. I guess the middle of book is what turned me off - beginning and ending were very entertaining. Still a good read but didn't live up to it's predecessor.
5,Still fantastic,Just not *quite* as good as the original - but I still loved it. Every single girl ofer 20 will devour it.
1,Less than Equal Sequel,"Better titled The Euthanasia of Bridget Jones, this disappointing sequel abandons the momentum of the first book's happy ending. Instead of enjoying Bridget's and Mark's deserved happiness, which could have incorporated a diverting plot and unforced comedy, we get more of Bridget's insecurities, Mark's stupid faithlessness and a ridiculous, trumped-up story.If I could unread a book , it'd be this one!"
2,I found it tiresome,"It's been a while since I read the first Bridget Jones (which made me laugh outloud and I lent out until the spine broke), but I'm quite disappointed with this new offering. It's just the same old same old. Perhaps the problem is that I'm past all the ""will he call"" ridiculous dating stuff and Bridget is not. I wish she'd grow up a little. I'm still reading this book (though I considered stopping) to find out what happens in the end, though I already know, but still I keep reading--but I find myself skimming and skipping pages; sometimes Bridget will just go on and on and I don't want to hear it. I think this book could have been shorter and Bridget could have used some actual character development."
3,Liked it quite well but...,"...it wasn't 100% on par with Bridget Jones' Diary. That said, I really did enjoy the book despite all the games poor Bridget went through, and the end was satisfying."
4,if you liked the first one. . .,"All you really need to know is that this is a satisfying sequel. You've probably read the first one and are just worried that the second may be monotonous and redundant. Well, it's a little redudant, but in a thoroughly enjoyable way. Who doesn't want to watch Bridget fumble through a relationship in much the same way she fumbled through being single?Liked the first one, you'll like the second one. 'Nuff said."
3,FUN!,"What can one say about Ms. Fielding's endearing character Ms. Bridget Jones? Another hilarious romp with Bridget. She remains as good hearted and as good natured as she was in the first novel and there couldn't be a female alive who wouldn't relate to Ms. Jones and her experiences. There should be nothing but gender pride for the honest and light hearted way in which Helen Fielding writes of female complexities and the chaotic emotions it can create. Although in this novel, Bridget's hijinks carry her a little afar, I continue to pass her adventures onto reading friends who may need a little lift and a few giggles, maybe just to remind them of who we are. . . and, hey, who ever said we all had to be so serious about everything anyway? Let's all sincerely hope this will not be the last that we'll hear from our dear friend -Ms. Bridget Jones. (Oops. Tumbled over.)"
4,Sequel That Is Better Than The Orginal,"I truely adored this book. I liked it so much that I read it in just one day. I thought the sequel was better than the first simply because I thought this one was funnier. The only problem I had with it though was the whole trip to Thailand. The part was just silly. The book would have been 10,000 times funnier without it, but I digress. Do your self a favor a check out this book."
4,Great follow-up to Bridget Jones' Diary,"Although not packing quite the punch of its predecessor, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is still relatively witty and amusing as poor Bridget bumbles through her life and the series of many mishaps, coincidences and a strange, out-of-place, but intriguing ending. Definitely a good book to pick up when you're feeling the effects of Bridget Withdrawal!"
5,HILARIOUS ESCAPE FROM EVERYDAY LIFE,"I have not read the first book nor did I see the movie. It was a real treat to meet Bridget and her friends in this hilarious book! The great thing about it is that...any woman can relate to Bridget in some way or another. The book was a very quick, easy read and a great escape throughout the day. Whenever things got boring, I'd just take this book out...it was a great refresher (somehow my life just seemed so much better...yet, when stepping on the scale in the morning...Bridget's life seemed way too familiar ;). This book should be taken lightly even though some of her ""adventures"" seem out there, just remember...it's a FICTION book :) HAVE FUN...and even splurge on the hard cover...it's on sale;)"
3,"I really liked ""diary""...","...so much so that I ordered the follow-up from the UK so that I wouldn't have to wait months more for the US release. I should have waited. Our Bridge has become self-conscious and both too sleazy and too posh. Her problems have become a bit non-relatable and she's more of a pain with fewer mitigating traits. Yes, I really liked ""Diary,"" and I'm much more likely to read that one again than this..."
4,pretty darn good,"I loved Edge of Reason, particuarly the Thai jail sequence and Colin Firth interview. All in all I thought it was a great follow-up despite certain repetitions of what we'd had before. But it was a good, funny read and I was pretty much engrossed in Bridget's misadventures. Also have to recommend The Trials of Tiffany Trott, another singleton/dating novel - a complete scream!"
3,The first one was better,It's hard to top a great book. The Edge of Reason wasn't quite as good as the original Bridget Jones' Diary. Bridget and Mark Darcy are still loveable. And Bridget is closer to the edge of insanity than the edge of reason throughout the book. It made me glad that I'm not still single! What saved the book was when Bridget was wrongly imprisoned in Thailand. This is one book that will probably be better as a movie.
2,CASHING IN?,"I adored the first Bridget Jones novel, so naturally was very eager to get my hands on this latest one. What a disappointment! Bridget is just silly in this one. I found myself not really caring what happened to her. And let's face it, in this sort of book, it's not like there won't be a happy ending. The whole way through, I couldn't shake the feeling that Helen Fielding was only in it for the money in this instance. Not the worst book I've ever read, but disappointing given the pleasure I derived from the first one."
4,Hilarious!,"Up for another dose of bridget and her pals? You will love this book, it's funny and touching. Fielding once again takes the reader into Bridget's somewhat unorganized and caotic lifestyle. You will laugh at how Fielding makes the everday ordinary absolutely hilarious!Edge of Reason takes off right where Bridget Jones's Diary ends. Bridget and Mark Darcy are together but keep reading to find out what happens with them. The cast is once again funny and their everyday antics will have you laughing uncontrollably!This was an excellent book to read. I loved Bridget Jones's Diary, but this was so much better!"
4,Hurrah for Bridget Jones!,"So often, sequels fail to live up to the promise of the original. Luckily this is not the case with ""The Edge of Reason"" which is as good as, if not better, than the original.This time around, Bridget finds herself singing Madonna lyrics in a Thai prison, waiting for the dustbin to ring dressed in nothing but her knickers, and falling in love with a certain Mr. Darcy. More of a romance and funnier than the original, this one is a winner (v.v.g.)"
2,Disappointment to intelligent readers,"I was so looking forward to the new adventures of Ms. Jones after finding her to be a loveable and indentifiable character in the previous book. However, Edge of Reason has turned her into a characature of an altogether rediculous human being. Her adventures are not the slightly blown versions of the real thing, but plain outlandish (Thai prison, naked youth with rabbit in boyfriends bed, death threat, etc). Unfortunately, this book came off as a hurried attempt to reap in on the profits created by the first Jones book. Surely most fans of the original novel will find it a sad sellout, and a poor representation of the character they have come to adore."
2,not worth it,"After reading and loving the first book, there was much excitment to read Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. However, it was a big dissapointment. It is not funny, or even entertaining. I give it 2 stars only for the last pages, of Bridget's christmas cards (which were hillarious). However, I don't think the joke is worth a whole book."
5,What a Great Book!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was like sitting and having a chat with an old friend.
1,"Second verse, same as the first","I read to page 10 and thought I could care less about this story...a young woman who thinks a six-week relationship that involves sex is a form of commitment...where has she been? She may need a copy of The Rules, a health exam to be sure she hasn't a dread disease, and some help getting some confidence in her own life. This is no longer funny, but rather pitiful. The first book seemed funy, but she learns nothing and is obviously doomed to repeat her life in daily notations that add up to little or nothing. ..................."
3,FAT GIRL FINDS LOVE IN CONTRIVED SEQUEL,"Why did BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY need a sequel? So everyone could cash in. In a blatant attempt to make a ton more money, Helen Fielding, penned this needless sequel. Still fat, Bridget finds contrived reasons to break up with Mark Darcy, stretch misunderstanding ala I LOVE LUCY, and then get back together 338 pages later. Nothing new here, but it was an entertaining read.Anyone looking for insight into Daniel Clever will be disappointed. He appears in about 2 pages of text."
3,Good but not Great,"I love ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". It was one of the funniest books I had ever read. Immediately upon finishing it, I ran to the store for the sequel. I was, however, greatly dissapointed. ""The Edge of Reason"" did possess all of the quirkiness and neuroses that made me love the first book, but several story lines were outlandish, and frankly hard to read. At times, it was downright ridiculous. I would recommend this book for an enjoyable read, but be forewarned that it fails in comparison to the original."
4,A great sequel,I read the first diary on Christmas Day and loved it so much that as soon as the shops reopened I sent my sister to buy the sequel.It was wonderful to see that Bridget was still as neurotic as ever and was still capable of messing up the smallest task with hilarious results. The interview with Colin Firth is in particular a classic section of the story.I dearly hope that we will hear from Bridget again as she doesnt seem the type to be laid to rest easily.
3,"Good, not as good as the first one...","Ok, I know what you are thinking - sequels are never as good as the first one, the real thing. But sometimes they come close. Here, Bridget is still our adorable, disorganized, imaginative Bridget, the same one we left at the end of Bidger Jones' Diary. At the beginning of the book, she's offically Mark Darcy's girlfriend, so she is feeling much more at peace with herself. But things change, and you will be surprised of how fast her (funny, but still usual, pretty close to boring) life becomes a sequence of strange occurrences and advantures, including - are you ready for this? - a few days in jail. But Bridget will survive that and much more, thanks to that sense of humor, self-irony and imagination that made us like her so much from the very first pages of her diary!So go ahead and read this, especially if you are a Bridget fan, you'll like it enough."
5,A Good Evening Read,"Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason by Helen Fielding is an easy evening read and a great source of side splitting humor and intrigue for any fan of Fielding's wit. While retaining her wit and great nack for story telling, she takes us to a historic London, exotic Thailand, the guilty pleasures of Heroine and the twisted accuracy of Pop Culture, clutching and fleeting with humanity and great characters.I curled up once again with my favorite reading music (John McArthur's, ""HIDDEN"") and found myself willingly transported through the lives of Bridget, Jude and Shazzar. (And what extraordinary lives indeed.) Only to find that the story was over and I wanted to read more.A must for any Helen Fielding fan!"
4,More of the same but fun,Just as fun as the first book but borders on unbelievable. You are less likely to relate Bridget's experiences to your real life experiences but very very fun. If you liked the first one this continues where it left off. Great vacation reading!
2,Bridget is pathetic,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and was really looking forward to the follow up. But here Bridget is truely pathetic and annoying! Get a life!! Don't bother with this book if you loved the first. You will be disappointed!!!!"
4,Not as good as the first,I think it must be the sequel issue--I just didn't like it as much as the first one. Maybe that is more of a compliment to the first book.
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"After loving ""Diary"", the sequel was somewhat disappointing. It followed the formula that made the first so successful, but the whole Thai prison section was a bit extreme and very unbelievable. Believability was what made the first one so good - we all could identify with Bridget, either ourselves or someone we knew. But her lack of affectedness in the prison was ridiculous - anyone would have been extremely traumatized and most likely unable to leave until they did their time. Other than that, I enjoyed the book - just not as much as the first one."
5,Just as excellent as the first!,"I wasn't sure if Helen Fielding would maintain the same level of excellency that she achieved in the first Bridget Jones but she did! This book is hilarious and starts up where the last one left off. I won't give away the plot or any of Bridget's, Jude's or Shazzer's antics so buy the book! You won't be disappointed."
5,Bridget's Back!,"If you loved Bridget Jones' Diary, you'll love this book. Bridget is back, and is crazier than ever. Her character becomes much more developed, as do those of the people around her. The plot gets thicker and thicker and is very unpredictable but one thing you can be sure of is that you'll laugh with the turn of each page.This book doesn't claim to be an amazing feat of literature in the academic sense. It's not always grammatically correct, nor does it pretend to be something it's not. It IS light reading, but entertaining. That's the beauty of both of these books. You open the cover and you are immediately immersed in her world, which is believable, colorful, filled with adventure and fun. She seems so real... it's almost as though you're reading letters from your best girlfriend, and she's filling you in on what's going on in her life.I just can't wait for the next sequel. I'm definitely addicted!"
4,It was cute,"Although I have seen the movie I have not read the first book so I can't really compare the two, only the story.I thought it was a pleasant read, I read it in only three sittings over three days but at points it kinda did drag a little.Some parts in it were a bit absurd but I guess that's the appeal of Bridget Jones!! At times I was really laughing :) so if you do like the movie or the first book you might wanna read this.I didn't find this necessarily better than the first story but I think it could have been a bit better.I just wish there was a third book because the story does leave you hanging... and i hate when that happens!"
4,This explains it all!,This book helped explained and went into futher detail of what happened in the first book of Bridget Jones. I definalty liked this 2nd book better. Great story lines... i could actually see all this happenen to someone. Kinda left you hanging at the ending.. maybe a 3rd book coming soon? Keep fingers crossed....
4,more misadventures -- literally and figuratively,"I've always thought the first few months of a relationship was more exciting than the event of getting together. For that reason, I enjoyed this sequel more than the original. Nestled in between all the twists of fate was the very human ambivalence, anticipation and hope that accompany any new relationship, which makes the novel truly poignant at times."
5,BJ's Back. Break Out the Chardonnay!,"It's not great literature, thank God. It's laugh-out-loud funny. Fans of the original can expect a grear evening in, reading this and roaring. So entertaining. I have never understood why Bridget is so popular in the US where it seems no one smokes or drinks and everyone goes to the gym, but maybe we Bridget clones are all stuck home alone without a Shazzer. Only thing that made me uneasy (real life intruding) is that by the end of this book HF has married off all the singletons, and then where will the rest of us be? Gaaah!"
2,A guilty pleasure,"This book is so irritating -- Bridget has been so dumbed down. It's difficult to relate to a heroine who is so stupid and clumsy and ""can't do anything right."" Of course, this is meant to be endearing, ala ""I Love Lucy"" -- but it's freakin' annoying. It's still entertaining, and I will read it till the end."
3,"Good, but not as good as the first","Upon hearing there was a sequel to Bridget Jones I immediately rushed out to purshase it. Though on the whole it was a good read, it missed the same sense of humor that the first on poessessed. Perhaps it is because Bridget has somewhat settled into living with Mark, and I felt she became too mature too quickly. However, there were the few humurous moments that kept me reading on. Overall it was just a good read, but disappointing compared to the first."
3,"Funny, but a rip-off of ""Brokedown Palace""","I thought the book was funny, but I was bothered by how stupid Bridget was in many parts of the book. No one is that stupid. The situations were just a bit far-fetched. Also, I can't beleive the Thai prison thing was just a coincidence..."
4,Persuasive!,"Once again Bridget Jones was enormously funny. Perhaps not quite as amusing as the first book for me, as I found myself frustrated by the main character's actions at several points. Nonetheless, worth repeated readings. Helen Fielding has again paralleled and parodied Jane Austin, in this case ""Persuasion"", in a manner that is sure to greatly amuse Austin fans. The parodies are not carried to extremes but are lighthearted and pleasurable, serving to remind us that social situations may change over the centuries but that people do not. Bridget continues to flounder through life in an enormously entertaining fashion."
5,excellent,"If you liked the first one, you'll love the second. If you haven't read the first one - buy it NOW! This is one of those sequels that you hope is only #2 in a long line of books. I was impressed that Fielding was able to come up with a very fresh plot, but still let the reader stay attached to all great characters from the first book. I cannot wait for the movie - and hopefully another book!"
2,Too much of the same,"As much as I loved the first Bridget book, I am having a very hard time maintaining my interest in this sequel, much to my disappointment. I find myself constantly feeling impatient at the lack of change and personal growth in the characters. All of the things they said and did and felt in the first book are identical in the second. I keep wanting to yell at Bridget ""Stop living in the same old rut -- and try growing up a bit!"" The writing is frequently humorous, and I've gotten some good laughs, but overall I feel this is a retread of the first book -- a few of the names have changed, but the situations and experiences and dialog are the same ole same ole."
1,Another Single Story!,"The first book of this ""series"" was exactly what it was supposed to be--a desperate singles story. However, I expected this one to chronicle Bridget Jones in a relationship. Boy, was I wrong. Single again, she is quickly driven into the same self-help cycles as the first book. Come on, Fielding...just reprint the first one with a couple names crossed out."
4,(4.5 stars),"I found this book to be better than the original, with enough action and edge of your seat plot-twists to keep anyone engaged fully."
4,"Good, Not Great","Although I loved Bridget Jones Diary, I found this one lacking something. Mainly, it was any originality in the first half of the book. It was more of Bridget messing up, disfunctional friends and family, etc. It wasn't even really funny as the original book had been.In the middle, however, Ms. Fielding got her second wind, threw in some plot twists and the laughs started up again. While not as funny as the first book, it still had some great moments and is worth a read."
5,HOORAY!,"Bridget Jones Edge of Reason is the perfect sequel to the first book written by Helen Fielding. It captures your attention not only with the continuence of british humor but blends in many new adventures for Bridget in her quest to maintain a relationship, lose weight, quit smoking and drinking, and above all get rid of her obsession with self help books. Fielding cleverly captivates her audience to the point where you can't wait to read Bridgets weight for the next day and how many seconds it has been since she last had sex. Bridget is a very lovable character whom every girl in the world can relate too.This is another fantastic book by Helen Fielding! It looks as though Fielding may be starting a series for this much loved singleton! HOORAY!"
4,Delightfully amusing sequel,"Monday 18 JuneNo. of times laughed out loud: Countless (v.g.), No of times wanted to throttle Bridget for not standing up for herself: 6 or 7 (poor), No. of happy endings: 1 (excellent!)3p.m. Home officeThe first half of the book had me laughing out loud, what with Bridget's tribulations with unruly scary underthings, her scatterbrained mum's usual chaos, discussions of ""active appendages"" and such.The story became more and more far-fetched as Rebecca's intentions became obvious and the botched holiday in Thailand. But it was really in good fun. I'm thankful, yet sad ( and envious) that only Bridget experiences this life so full of tumult and chaos."
3,Good - but very much based on Persuasion!,"I've reaslised HF has lifted much of her second books from Jane Austen's Persuasion which I've just finished. For example:The scence where MArk is writing a letter at a party whilst Bridget is saying that if you love a man you cannot get him out of your system. Lifted straight from the Anne, Captain Wentworth scene.The scene where Bridget is telling Giles about self help books at dinner party. Lifted straight from the bit at Lyme where Anne consoles a captain who has lost his wife by referring to comforting literary texts.The scene where Rebecca jumps from the bridge = the scene where Louisa falls from the cob - I could go on.It spoiled my enjoyment of the original classic no end! Helen your books are really funny anyhow, I'm sure you could have managed without such clumsiness! Or is literature like pop music now and you can get away with it under the guise of a tribute?"
3,Faster and Fastest,"A nice, fast read. I read both diaries and though I found this one less memorable than the first, it is far from offensive. Best to read while driving or at work. Concentration is not essential."
2,"Silly, Irreverent Nonsense, Disappointing","A ho-hum sequel. Sure, it's fun. The characters are all back and the laughs still flow, but the plot is thin, the story is ridiculously unbelievable, and so much of this story is plucked right out of some classic novels, including Pride and Prejudice. Overall, this is a rushed sequel, contrived, and far less enjoyable or inspiring than its predecessor. A bubbly, witty, and consistently surprising Bridget Jones gives way to a boring, paranoid, and totally un-funny darker side."
1,Impossible to read,"I like the story, I like the movie, but the book was impossible to read. It was just too broken up with a lot of slang - maybe if I hadn't seen the movie first I would have enjoyed it, but after a few pages I put the book down, it just wasn't worth the effort."
3,"Good, but not as good as the first","This book is good, but I didn't like it as much as the original. This one seemed to drag on a little long, but it was still enjoyable to read."
3,Dumb Fun,"This book comes into a different climate than the original, which launched the publication of many new books in the independant-woman's-coming-of-age genre. It no longer has the fresh originality of the first, nor does it compare well to other, better, recent books, like the Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing. On the other hand, it launches right into the amusing Bridget tone and sustains it throughout. There were quite a few times in the first half when I couldn't get into the story. Often, the characters are being annoyingly stupid just to advance a plot point, and most of the situations are standard, over-the-top, boring sit-com fare. It reads like a B movie. And yet, I kept reading and eventually was drawn back in and enjoyed the resolution. We do have to hand it to Ms. Fielding for jump-starting a genre that I'm enjoying overall. I just hope they don't make a movie out of this story - we've seen it already."
3,Doesn't compare to the first,"This book was enjoyable and a very quick read. However, I didn't find it halfway as good as the first Bridget Jones and felt some of the scenarios were a little overboard. If you are looking for another book of the ""Bridget Jones"" genre, there are much better ones out there!"
5,Laughs in one sitting: non-stop (v.v.g.),"I didn't think Helen Fielding could top herself, but she did. Bridget is even funnier this time around! I laughed 'til tears ran down my face (yes, it's THAT funny). Who else but Bridget can get herself into the situations she does and pull it off with such finesse? I hope, beg and pray there is another Bridget book out there and that Helen Fielding is listening. I want my own Bridget...heck, can I just BE Bridget!"
4,"fabulous, sweetie","As a thirtysomething singleton, Bridget has become a good friend! She is once again navagating life with her assortment of pals, both smug and otherwise. Despite the craziness of a few situations-Edge of Reason is for anyone who loved Bridget the first time around."
5,Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason.,"After reading the first book I was left wanting more tales of Bridget Jones. The Edge of Reason was just what I needed. More uproarious situations that made me laugh out loud! I could not put this book down. Even the man sitting next to me on an air plane asked me about the book because he said ""I really seemed to enjoy it."" If you like the Diary you will like The Edge of Reason, I surely did."
2,Lost potential,"THE EDGE OF REASON and Frank McCourt's 'TIS are classic examples of what gets lost when the authors are rushed into supplying sequels. Both of these books had enormous potential, and both fell extremely short of their mark. This Bridget is a whiner and her airhead friends are hard to tell apart. The mother/daughter relationship which was so lovingly and comically described in THE DIARY becomes flat and stale here. Although the comedy sometimes hearkens back to the high-giggle level of THE DIARY (witness the screamingly funny interview with Colin Firth and Bridget's plane ride to Thailand), much of the comedy also falters. The plot needs to be shaped into more of an arc. I agree with other reviewers who say that this book needs to be edited--and I don't mean just correcting the spelling of the First Lady's name."
4,A worthy successor!,"Bridget's back, and this time instead of getting a man, she's focused on keeping the one she's got. Her complete inability to escape bumbling, awkward social situations (arrested for drug possession in Thailand, blowing an interview with Colin Firth) truly makes one feel better about one's own social graces (or near complete lack thereof). Though not quite as laugh-out-loud as the first, the book is still quite funny and we're kept rooting for Bridget until the end when true love reigns, and makes you hope that there's someone out there for you who'll appreciate all your inadequecies as much as Mr. Darcy does Bridget's. And if he happens to be handsome and rich as well so much the better! ;-)"
4,Bridget Jones:The Edge of reason,"The sequal to Bridget Jones' Diary is absolutyly hylarious.Helen Fieding is a wonderful author who really know's how to bring real life into her books. Briget Jones is a modern girl with whom eveyone can relate to. This book keeps you coming back for more, wondering what Bridget is going to do next, and what is going to happen in her life. This is a must read!"
3,"Fun read, but not as much as the original diary","Although the reviews for ""The Edge of Reason"" have been general more positive than the original ""Diary"", I have to say that this one didn't really measure up as much as I hoped. For some reason the manic, hilarious nature of Bridget's life that was presented so cleverly and with such a tongue-in-cheek self-reflective way kinda gets lost in this book, and it just doens't ring as true.Still, the style and the humor are still there, and both ""Bridget"" books retain their place in my library as top-notch books to read while commuting (if you don't mind being embarressed by laughing out loud on a packed subway car)."
5,Bridget is back and as crazy as ever!,"The sequel to ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is as funny as the original. In the last book, Bridget escaped ""singleton"" status by finding true love with Mark Darcy. In this book, she manages to ruin a good thing by just being Bridget. Her obsession with every aspect of the relationship and over-analysis of every word uttered by Mark Darcy soon throws the entire affair into chaos. Still, Bridget stumbles along- obsessing over her weight, her friendships and her neglected career. I haven't laughed this hard since the first book. Don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that Bridget has two unforgettable encounters in this story: one with hunky British actor Colin Firth, and one with a foreign prison. If you liked the first one, the sequel will not disappoint! I laughed myself silly. To Helen Fielding: keep the Bridget adventures coming!"
2,Two much of a good thing,"I read Bridget Jones' Diary quite a while back and had been hoarding this book for ages, looking for just the right amount of uninterrupted reading space. Sad to say, it wasn't quite the 'unputdownable' book I'd expected it to be. It started off on the right note, but soon began dragging unbearably. The gaffes began to seem awfully repetitive -- one just had to imagine the worst-case scenario and our heroine was right there. Also, the book could have done with some heavy editing, maybe in the middle months? It's reading value would have gone up considerably had it been around 30 pages shorter. They do say sequels rarely live up to their predecessors. Sad to say, this one only reinforces that feeling."
4,In some ways better than the original,In some ways I liked this book better than the first one. Trying to imagine her singing Madonna songs had me rolling and I loved the last few pages with her signing her Christmas cards. V.G.
3,Entertaining - great for reading while commuting,"If you only have a few minutes at a time for reading, as on the subway or bus, this is a great book (along with the original Bridget Jones Diary.)I enjoyed the first book more as I felt I could relate more with the occurrences in Bridget's life. In this sequel, her life takes some unexpected and less reality based turns, which I found it difficult to relate to.My one caution to this book is that, much like with the writings of Dr. Seuss, I found myself starting to think in the stilted thought bursts that Ms. Fielding writes in.Overall, enjoyable, but not as groundbreaking or ""real"" as the original."
5,For Women Everywhere ! ! !,What else can I say? Read it! And quickly. It's even better (that is - funnier) than the first Bridget Jones novel. So much so that you may not be able to read it in public.This book is so good that I bought a copy for my cousin just so I wouldn't have to lend her mine!Now go get one of your own.... and thank me later.K.
4,v.g.,The recording of Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason was fantastic. I laughed so hard I was practically crying. My life demands that I spend lots of time in my car. The book on tape was a terrific way to enjoy commuting. My favorite character is Bridget's boss. The audio does a terrific portrayal of the characters. I thoroughly recommend this sequel to anyone who can really laugh at themselves!
4,Adorable follow-up to a fabulous book,"This book was really good and I highly recommend it to any Bridget fan. To me, the original will always be the gold standard but I found the unravelling of the story (as well as Bridget) to be fairly fulfilling. I ordered the book from Amazon.uk in December because I couldn't wait and have read it a half a dozen times! Look forward eagerly to the next volume in the Bridget saga."
5,Great replacement easy install,put up with droopy lift supports far too long...product works perfectly and was an easy install. Definitely recommend to any liberty owner needing replacement lifts
5,Strong like bull,"Purchased for 2002 Liberty struts that suddenly did not hold.Luckily I got out from under the hood just before hood dropped.StrongArm struts were very easy to install.Have someone hold the hood during replacement,pop the old ones off,snap the new ones in,and that's it.New struts function terrific.Great value for the money!"
5,Perfect replacement fit.,"Bought these to replace the stock hood struts for my Jeep Liberty 2002 V6.These are a perfect fit and very easy to install. No tools needed to install, however a screwdriver or some type of prying tool is needed to remove the clips on the old struts.These struts are so strong I had a hard time closing the hood after I first installed them, however after a few times they have seemed to break in and aren't quite so stiff."
1,NO!!!! NOT AGAIN!!!,"""Live In Las Vegas."" ""Live In Cincinnati."" ""Live In Auburn"" ""Live In Mansfield."" And now we have to hear ""Live In Hawaii""? All from the same tour. All containing almost identically lifeless versions of basically the same songs. Hang it up, Jimmy. I'm sorry. I really used to be a big fan, but this is just taking advantage of your audience's loyalty to the extreme. And yes, like the fool I am, I bought it, but this is the last time.Do yourselves a gigantic favor other Parrotheads. Buy Bill Jabanoski's newest CD ""Key West, Florida ...Island Of Dreams"" which is sensational or the great ""The Key West Party CD"" instead of this if you want that Key West sound."
1,BUFFET SCRATCHY IN HAWAII,WHILE THIS IS A LIVE CD JIMMY SOUNDS A BIG OUT OF VOICE - A BIT OFF KEY - AND A BIT STALE ... GUESS IT WAS THE END OF TOUR OR MAYBE TOO MUCH TIME IN THE TIKIT HUT BAR. dISAPPOINTING SOUND QUALITY AS WELL
1,Jimmy in Hawaii,I was so disapointed that the DVD was only 15 minutes long. I love to watch the Jimmy fans acting crazy. All the other CD's with DVD were so much more fun than this one was.
1,MORE OLD STUFF???????????????,"Dang.....I like JB ok, but how many cds is he going to put out with the same old stuff? It's like the man has a ""new"" cd out every week. I have his boxed set....that's enough."
3,Buffett stays with what works,"This is more Buffett same old same old. Made before his new hit CD ""Licence to Chill"" it revisits many of his old hits and does it in the same old way. Not a stand out hit!"
5,Jimmy Buffett.... nothing but the best,All you parrotheads will understand this....Fins to the left.... Fins to the right...2 thumbs up for Buffett!!!
5,This is the way to get all of Adam Ford's dvd's,"Best value here to get all of his DVDs in one shot. Tons of options and workouts. I've moved them all over to my zune player and set it up at the gym so I can follow along. When I only have a little time, I do the 3D Abs workout (a different product) and when I have a litle more time I do a ball routine mixed with weight training and cardio. I'm finding that I like a lot of variety in my workouts and am responding better to constantly changing things.These videos are VERY polished - very slick and extremely well produced. His body is an inspiration and he's very calm when he instructs. There's no yelling to do more, no pushing to failure. Much calmer. But you WILL feel it! It's like yoga in that the more you know the more challenging it gets."
4,Fresh and Different,"This is a remarkable and creative first album, with country, indie, pop and rnb influences its distinctive flavour must be heard."
3,Good basketball hoop for the price,"This hoop was easy to assembly. Directions were just pictures but there are not that many pieces. The provided screws hold it together nicely once you can get all the pieces matched up.The durability appears to be good, we had five 10 year olds playing in the pool with it all evening without it breaking or coming apart. Overall, for the price point it is a decent hoop but just from construction and materials, I do not see it holding up longer than a year."
2,difficult to assemble,"Yes, this toy is difficult to assemble. The lower and upper rings are made of three bent pieces, but they are not bent nearly far enough from the factory. I had to use a hair drier and persuation to assemble this, took 30 minutes on something that should have taken 3 minutes. On the plus side it has held up well to daily abuse by a teenager this summer."
1,Impossible to put together.,This is the worse thing to put together not worth the money or the never ending time to put together. Bad bad bad!!!!!
3,Fun in the pool,"I agree with other posts that mentioned the degree of difficulty in assembly. I scoffed at them when making my buying decision. How hard could this be? Then the package came and I started putting the pieces together. I struggled to get the hoop sections assembled before screwing them together. Every time I'd get 2 of three together the thing would pop apart when trying to put the third piece in. I was not about to let this thing get the better of me and my assembly skills. When I finally got the thing together I am sure I must have yelled a triumphant hoorah. Took twice as long as it should have taken, but overall, for the money it looks to be just what I wanted. A cheap toy for the pool. I guess you get what you pay for. Now I hope it holds up."
1,I'm Sorry,I had ordered this for our pool. The package was so pretty ! I tried with everything I had to put it together and it wouldn't go together. Plus it was missing a part. After a long time of trying I LITTERLY Trashed it in the TRASH. At that time I kept the box it was pretty. I don't know why I did but I did . I made a bad judgment call and wrote a horrible review about this company.Then after I wrote it and posted it I contacted the company ! We are all human being and I made a horrible mistake miss judging this company. They took care of the problem and I am very relieved . I feel bad I didn't go to them 1 st. YES I do believe I would buy from this company again . Our country is so easy to judge . All I can say is im sorry I miss judged this company and I hope the public will give this company a chance. We are not all perfect only one person is and that is our lord.
2,Buy Something Else!,"I read all the reviews before buying this hoop. I appreciated McElligot's review. Thanx for taking the time to write that, it helped a little. First of all I NEVER write reviews, but I thought I would take the time today. STAY AWAY from this product! It is poorly, cheaply, and horribly built and designed. I have put together swingsets before and they weren't this bad. It doesn't help when you get someone else's return either, that they managed to mangle! How could I tell you that? Well, maybe because of the hair on the pipes, or maybe it was the bent (hoop pipe) that was sent with the product. Maybe I just watch too much NCIS! I decided to go with it and assemble it anyway, just because I don't want to bother with a return. Overall review: I bought this hoop preparing for the worst. It wasn't the worst, only because the product looks cool when you manage to fight and get it assembled. Is it rocket science, NO. But try and build a log cabin with match sticks! I'm Out!"
1,Should have read more reviews,"Received shipped in timely nammer, but my husband had to heat every single piece of pvc to get it to bend; there's no way out of box it would make two circles top and bottom. It finally went together, but was not worth the money and manual adjusting. I'd have returned it if I didnt have a 10, 7 and 5 year old standing by me waiting for assembly. Dont waste your money, buy a different hoop set."
1,Worst made product ever!,I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this. It simply CANNOT be put together. I had a similar one before that went together in 5 minutes but that was obviously a different brand. DO NOT BUY THIS!
1,Don't buy!,This came with missing parts so we couldn't even put itTogether. Big rip off. Do not buy !!
2,art_house,Purchased 3 for an art project. relied on the picture shown for reference. item does not look like the picture shown. very disappointed.
5,What better way to celebrate the holidays,"than with Frank and family...true the family numbers seem a little hokey but that Riddle arrangement and Cahn adaptation of ""The Twelve Days Of Christmas"" really made me smile, complete with a grand Riddle tag on the end of the arrangement. Here is one of only two places you will find the hauntingly beautiful ""Whatever Hapenned To Christmas"", arranged by Don Costa, and written by Jimmy Webb. And the album opens with a very poignant reading of my personal fave Christmas song ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"", arranged beautifully by Nelson Riddle's understudy Gil Grau. I dont think Nels could've done any better. Im not too keen on the Frank/Bing numbers, not being a Bing fan, but the album as a whole is very substantial to any Sinatra collector, or just to say Merry Christmas any time of the year."
2,"Dullsville, baby...","What a dud. Lackluster versions of holiday favorites, especially disappointing because it's from Frank. The whole album is overproduced (all Frank is overproduced, but usually in a good way) in all the wrong directions. The ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" is the biggest stinker of them all with its terrible rewritten lyrics sung by Frank's terribly un-talented offspring. Stick with JOLLY CHRISTMAS from Capitol and you'll ring-a-ding-ding in the holiday season in style."
2,The Chairman seems bored,"Of the three Sinatra Christmas CDs available, this one is the runt of the litter. While its hard to criticize a Sinatra CD this one is dragged down by his strange lack of emotion in his singing, his questionable choice of obscure Christmas songs and the dubious decision to include his kids on three selections. While there's still some gems here this is not Sinatra at his holiday best."
3,Oy!,"Frank Sinatra never recorded an entire Christmas album for Reprise Records, but this CD compiles all the Christmas songs he recorded for that record label. Songs are taken from an album he recorded with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring, an album he recorded with his three kids, and a handful of singles. Most of the material is good, but there are a few weak songs here, especially among the ones he recorded with his children. Still, it's very complete, and well worth getting if you're a Sinatra fan."
4,"Skip the capitol xmas album, get this one instead",I'm a huge sinatra fan and expected the capitol sinatra albumto be a swingin' affair. I've grown to appreciate it over theyears but it doesn't come close to the Reprise Sinatra ChristmasAlbum. Album covers a period from the early 60's through themid 70's. What I like about this collection:1. It's in chronological order2. Great arrangements (sorely lacking on the capitol album)3. Great choice of songs with a nice mix of the secular andsacred.4. Hard to find stuff like Christmas memories and a baby justlike you.Skip tracks 8-10 and you've got a perfect sinatra christmas collection.
2,"""What ever happened to Christmas"".....","I bought this CD for the song ""What Ever Happened to Christmas"", one of my very favorite Christmas songs.I was disappointed by the family renditions of the songs. I lost interest as I am sure someone listening to my family sing silly versions of traditional Christmas songs would also. When I purchased this CD I did not realize this.Still, there are some good songs just with Frank."
4,kids like it,and thats whats important. has like 20 plus games for 11 bucks .. you can't beat that with a stick!
3,Good if you like the older sega games!,I got this game because I remember playing these older sega games when I was young. Some I remember but most of them I don't. There are not any instructions so if you don't know what you are doing then you are on your own. They graphics are awful and the games don't have all the levels. Just get to do some reminiscing.
4,HIGH replay factor!,"Got this for Gain Ground and Phantasy Star II.The playing screens get compressed on Gain Ground, but then 5 extra boards are added that weren't on the arcade version.Recommended for those with a PS II and want to relive the days of yore (ie. leaving your quarters on the machine at the arcade while waiting your turn)."
4,Great game,"If you like games like F-Zero GX you'll love this game. XGRA isn't as amazingly fast as F-Zero GX, so you'll have a slightly easier time of seeing where you're going (except in weather or when you hit super speeds.) What F-Zero GX lacks that XGRA does have, is the ability to shoot at, blow up and generally wreak havoc on your opponents. The AI in this game is fun and there is a vendetta system. If you fire at another player long enough, they will carry that grudge through the game. The trash talk is fun, sometimes repetitive, but it doesn't get in the way. If anything it adds to the effect while you're racing for first place, dodging mines, and various forms of weapons; all the while trying to take out a few of your own. This is a great game for the money, it's not the best out there - but you could certainly do far worse."
4,World Atlas,Wonderful small world atlas. Works well with my hobby of Amateur Radio. Great for looking up counties of states. Much good information.

3,Meh......,"This was an ok game but it really wasn't anywhere close to as good as the movie. The driving's ok but the ""stunts"" are boring and the cars honestly suck. If you want a nice driving game go for Need for Speed: Carbon or Underground."
4,Fun Listening,"At it's heart, this album is simply a fun rock record. Not incredibly complex or difficult, just easy. A little pop/indie/punk/alternative/garage rock all thrown in for something I view as far superior to the two follow up albums from The Willowz. Definitely a recommended buy."
4,Toothsome,"Pop the box and you see an Egon Schiele drawing, an attenuated early modernist nude wearing her anxieties on her skin. It's a fitting visual reference, for the Willowz are a nervous band, also a raw, ambitious, self-challenging, brilliant and perplexing one. They have great hooks, a gift for casually tossing off little bits of humor and beauty, and this timeless unselfconscious quality that's easier heard than described. In the bland stew of indie rock, the Willowz are a toothsome morsel. (review from Scram Magazine #21)"
5,Classic Read,Thoroughly enjoyed the Oldie Worldy stories of the life of a little Boy lost growing up in the wold of Jungle Animals.
4,Good Book!,No changes from the printed version to the e-book. It was fun to read this classic again - worth the time.
1,Mechanical reading,Ms. Burns brings little dynamism to her reading. She rushes through the disk too rapidly and mechanically to permit real enjoyment.
3,The Grandest Book Entitled: The Jungle Book,"This is a touching book about a boy who is abandoned by the villagers of India when he is just a little baby. He is found by a pack of wolves and they raise him as one of their own pups. When he grows up, he finally has contact with humans. He meets his little brother and his mother. I would recommend this book for older people such as high shcoolers, or people going to collage. This book has content that might be harder for younger children, so I wouldnt recommend it for them. But for the older people, I think you should read this book."
3,Try it!,"It depicted the culture and feelings of different animals standing on their sides. Also, it provides the view from them to forest and to human. It contains exciting stories of Mowgli growing up. A very good book for education."
3,Interesting,This book was an interesting book but I had a hard time getting into the whole thing. Also it was hard to read because it was written in olden language. I think if they rewrote the book in an easier way to read it everyone would be happy including me. But overall I liked this book.
2,Eh...,"I liked it, but it was so dry. I only barely finished it, I'm sorry if my review isn't what you'd expect"
4,Great Book,The book is great! The version could be navigated but was not the easiest to navigate (hence 4 instead of 5 stars).
3,Beware = Only Book 1 of the Jungle Book,"If you're looking for the entire Jungle Book - this isn't it. Also, the way the poems are inserted makes it somewhat difficult to follow. Not having a table of contents is also a negative."
1,not for toddlers,"Purchased the book, thinking it would have the lovely, colorful pictures of the original book so I could read the story as my toddler grandchild looked at the pictures and we could share the story. No pictures, only text"
3,under 13 test review,under 13What makes a good review?Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
3,test review,What makes a good review?Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
3,Great Story For Adult Comprehension,"I bought this book to read to my sons because they loved Rikki Tikki Tavi (also by R. Kipling). Of course this is a great story, but the original Kipling version is very hard to understand for younger readers (or listeners in this case). I found myself having to go back and explain each paragraph or page to make sure my son (who is fairly bright) was following along. For an adult to read for her/his self, I am sure it would be great. Kipling has such wonderful way of telling stories from the animals' points of view. Had I bought it for myself I may have ranked it a 5 star, but the storyline seemed to lend itself more to being read to my kids."
4,Great buy.,Ive been enjoying this book as I read it to my granddaughter who is too young to understand it but it soothes her. So I guess the story has really captivated me. I would recommend to any parent that likes to read to their children. Great buy.
2,(Great Illustrated Classics)- Malvina Vogel adaptation,"The Jungle Book (Great Illustrated Classics)- Malvina Vogel Adaptation.Totally agree with previous review.- How dare she?! - it was my only thought when I opened The Jungle Book (Great Illustrated Classics) - How dare she to take the gorgeous, Nobel Prize winning language and replace it with her bloody nonsense?! And put the Kipling's name on the cover? Does she think children (for whom this book apparently meant) are primitive morons? Think again, miss Vogel. Think again."
3,"Join the band of brothers - Kaa, Baloo and of course Mowgli","Kipling is always an enjpyable read, despite what Disney did to the Jungle Books. Mowgli and the wolves of the Seeonee pack, Baloo the bear, Bagheera the black panther - and of course the villains like Sher Khan. Good reading for adults as well as children. Classic writing."
3,Different from Disney animated movie,"This book was a lot different than the Disney animated movie. I was surprised at how different many of the main characters were from the Disney animated movie. However, the story was entertaining but rather short. There is another story in the volume that I read."
1,The Jungle Book audio book,"Very poor reading. Only one person reading for all the characteers. Dull and dreary voice. No thrill at all.At least, it is a full version."
4,Fantastic.,"Loved it. Mowgli is just a loving character and as an Indian version of the Jungle Book is a fav among kids in Hindi, this is a sure pick for all children. Rudyard Kipling takes kids for a ride to an adventure with thrills and fantasies. Fun read."
4,"good book, but not all the stories","This book has the story The Jungle Book, but it doesn't include ALL of the short stories affiliated with The Jungle Book. Overall pleased with my purchase, just a tad disappointed, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. This is a wonderful story, and the book was in great shape when I received it."
5,Great read,What can be said about this book it is a classic. And I loved reading it again on my reading device.
3,Great,It was great I love the book it was awesome love to read children's books it was amazing I love it
3,Jungle book is ok,It's ok it's sorta confusing with it jumping around to different stories but other than that it was an ok book
3,I've still not decided,"This book is a bit boring for me,but i have'nt even reached puberty yet so i shouldn't judge it yet."
5,Brilliant!,"I loved the Jungle Book. I was surprised since I expected it to be hard to understand given the era when it was wrote but I quickly found myself immersed in the stories included.I was also surprised that it featured more than one story. I thought the Jungle Book would just feature the story of Mowgli, like on the Disney film but it also features 5 other stories, each of which are good reads.Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is quite a famous tale and well worth checking out. It tells the story of a Mongoose working to protect a human family from a family of snakes.I loved it! Brilliant book and well worth getting."
4,A Nicer read,"Though Walt Disney and Enid Blyton are my fav picks for children, The Jungle Book is a nicer read. Mowgli is just a loving character and as an Indian version of the Jungle Book is a fav among kids in Hindi, this is a sure pick for all children. Rudyard Kipling takes kids for a ride to an adventure with thrills and fantasies - it all depends on the taste and choice of read. However, I recommend this book as this is fun read and kids in my library too, love to read and watch The Jungle Book. Enjoy!- ilaxi"
2,Altering Kipling's prose?!,"Just read the previous review (about 'simplifying' thelanguage in Jungle Book). I am reading the ORIGINALtext JB to my eight year old son (for over a week now),and he's not once indicated that the language puzzleshim. He did ask me why Mowgli uses thee and thouand wouldst while talking with the animals, butaccepted my explanation without demur.Reminds me of the lines from an Elinor Wylie poem""Our mutable tongue is like the seaCurled wave and shattering thunder-fit;Dangle in strings of sand shall heWho smooths the ripples out of it.""Say it out loud, and feel what it does to yourmouth and face - that's what Kipling's prosedoes."
2,Very poor layout,"Free is good but some quality control would have been nice.As it is, chapters and even complete stories flow over in each other without any non-literal clue."
4,Great book for all ages,this is a book which can be read by anyone and each read makes it more interesting. had read some stories long back and loved reading it again.
5,Echos of Mogli,It is now seventy years since my father made Baloo and Bagheera and Kaa seem real and absolutely believable. The magic still works.
3,someday,stocking up on freebies... .it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
3,Um... Is this the complete book?,This doesn't appear to be the complete book to me. Someone should compare with an actual copy. Seems to have picked up somewhere in the middle of the story...
4,NICE READ OF CLASSIC BOOK,"NICE, EASY READ OF A CLASSIC PIECE OF LITERATURE. NICE, EASY TO FOLLOW STORIES THAT CAN BE READ IN A SHORT TIME."
2,i dont know about this....,"its not realy a deicide sounding record. the production on this one is bad, and it was recorded at morrisound!they got the gtr player from iced earth and his solos are too happy/melodic to be deicide solos. his solos make this sound like progressive metal.the vocals sound good though. glen has that doubled high/low thing going on and it is good."
4,Like a breath of fresh air ---- 4 1/2 stars,"Deicide are back. Having parted ways with their record label and the Hoffman brothers, Deicide has released an album that fans having been waiting years for. Its obvious that Deicide couldnt stand their previous record label; and they released some sub-par albums because they were under contract with them. Lets face it, Insineratehymn and In Torment In Hell sucked. Thankfully, they are done with Roadrunner Records and 2006 is a new era, not only for Deicide, but for heavy music in general. The Stench Of Redemption never lets up from beginning to end. I cant pick out a bad song on the album.Highly Recommended !!!!"
5,Glen Has Done It!!!!!,This is by far Deicides best album to date. One of the top releases of 2006. Looks like Glen made the right choice by replacing the Brothers.
3,An improvement over the last few,"The addition of Santolla and Owen seemed to reinvigorate this band. I think one could make a strong argument for how much better this band could be without Benton. The Hoffman brothers plus Asheim and Benton is what Deicide is and will always be to me. The Hoffman's riffing made those early albums special. These two guitarists have changed the music for the better but the atmosphere has changed along with it. Benton comes off as more one-dimensional then ever now. Maybe all the musicians should get together and find a vocalist that can suit this new found style and change the band name. I guess that wouldn't sell as good as the name Deicide banks off of now though. And by the way, ""Black Night"" was one of the most poorly executed covers I have ever heard. Overall this was a good record, but it has many flaws that stop it from climbing to the next level."
5,"Forget expectations, this is an incredible album!!","All reviews here tells a lot about the album. I just wanna say: forget Deicide and be open minded. This is fast, precise and melodic brutal death metal. The only new part: melodic... and pretty damn good melodies. Five stars, this album deserves it!"
5,Beautiful,"What a record ! I haven't listened to them for a long time, but now this has become one of my favourite. Awesome production, brilliant throughout the way. Some majestic, satanic greatness is revealed by adding two top musicians who shred just awesome heart-ripping solos. Listen to ""Homage For Satan"", you'll understand ! What beautiful melodies. This record stands out breaking the cliches and the monotony of other bands. This one mixes the specific Deicide sound with new, incredible creative guitars and wonderful melodic solos. Get it !"
2,Too cute,"I was very disappointed with this book. It had terrific potential, but the characters and plot became tediously zany."
5,Best in a long time,"Sorry, but I found this on a discount table and decided to give it a try. This reminded so much of the small town in which I grew up, characters around each corner (the two corners). I read oodles on long business trips and this was the most pleasant surprise for me in 1997. It is probably not up to everyone's taste, but the producers of 'Never Give an Inch' (Sometimes a Great Notion) should take a look into this."
3,"Good read, weak ending","The story starts off well with unusual characters and setting. But by halfway through, I got tired of all the backing and forthing socially and sexually. The ending is contrived and shallow, seems like the author got tired of the book or lost her focus. Some memorable moments nontheless..."
1,Waste of my money,"This curling iron gave me a problem from the start. The cord would tangle up while I was trying to use it. Then I would notice it would cool down while I was using it and realized it was actually cutting off on its on while I was using it. Finally, after having it for 2 months and not using it every day either, it has stopped working all together. It comes on, but will not heat up. Seemed to be defective from the beginning."
3,Revlon RV068 Hair Iron,"I like the shape of this iron, but my only complaint is that the clasp to hold the hair in place is a little loose. My hair seems to slip out too easily."
1,Useless,This product is so useless! The spiral cord is stuck to the rod and does not help hold the hair to be curled.I would not advice anyone to buy this. I returned it immediately!
1,Do not waste your money!,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this product before purchase. This is the worst purchase I have ever made. It does nothing! It is difficult to use, the curl ends up all on the tip of your hair. Spare yourself and your money do not purchase this product."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,This iron is junk. There is a heat knob that turns to adjust the heat setting but the wiring inside of the iron keeps getting caught on the knob making it almost imposible to turn. The wiring issue is also a possible shock hazzard.
2,Iffy,"This item came with absolutely no instructions. If you are not a ""hair person"" this product was difficult for me to work with."
1,Ummm....,"This disc blows chunks on so many levels it's hardly worth being used as a drink coaster. It is, therefore, part of the permanent collection."
4,As good as I've heard,"This band is from Brazil. Even though the lyrics could be translated better the intent is there and the melodies are strong and vibrant as a doom metal can get. This one is a bit more melodic and guitar driven than their previous albums ""Goddess of Tears"" and ""Dance of Shadows"". Nice mix of female and growling vocals. I also recommend the aforementioned albums."
2,Unbelievably out of date!,"I just wrote to the company to let them know how incredibly old this product is. The copyright is from 1998, the example browser is Netscape, and it defines terms like ""Floppy Disk"" and ""Modem."" I am really amused that the company's website has built-in sharing for every social network from Reddit to Pinterest, and yet this poster makes no mention of social networks. It does, however, admonish children not to share personal information in chat rooms. Come on guys, get with the times."
5,Freestyle Street Soccer,This gae is the best game ever that i have played and the shipping is super fast got here before the estimated date so this is a good place to buy your things from.
5,Original Salve Stops Itiching Fast,"I am being treating with a new protocol for non-diabetic Peripheral Neuropthy which requires six injections of a Novacain type substance per foot for 8 visits. Well the skin started itching due to the sticky surface of the bandaids put on the area that recieved the injections. This was not a small itch, it was so intense it woke me up at night and I developed a rash. I aways get a rash from a bandaid or anything with stickey surface that comes in contace with my skin. My doctor gave me a sample of Herb Pharm Original Salve which I applied to all the areas that were used for the injections and whala no more itch. It is a great product to have around the house and when on vacation. I will not be without it as a result of my very postitive experience."
5,Salvation!,"Incredible stuff! I used Herbal Ed's Salve on a sore that I got while traveling and had had for two months. As soon as I used this salve my sore began to disappear and it was clear within four days. I bought this salve because it was the only one I could find that contained propolis, which is a natural anti-biotic from bees. I am taking Herbal Ed's Salve whenever I travel as it is a perfect size and catch-all remedy!"
4,Fun with Rabbits,"I fell in love with Sparks the first time I heard them in my dorm room several decades ago. While this album is not their greatest, it does contain several indispensable songs. ""Pretending to be Drunk"" is great fun, as the ironic narrator reveals that to be popular, you should learn that ""everyone will be impressed, I'll pass out on your knee."" Others are somewhat more sincere, as ""With All My Might"" the hero promises to ""Slay the dragons that hang around you all the time.""Every Sparks album has a different flavor, and this is just well produced synth-pop with some brains behind it. Now with over 21 albums behind them, the Brothers Mael are still on the edge, but the industry, of course, has not yet caught up with them. Check out 'Hello Young Lovers' to see where funny, unexpected, yet accessible music can go."
1,Pointless and Misleading,"If you want to consult the First Folio, get a facsimile. Freeman's ""editions"" are not only pointless, they are profoundly misleading: only someone who was completely ignorant about Jacobean book-production could possibly suppose that the vagaries of F1 represent a meticulous adherence to Shakespeare's intentions. In the matter of lineation, for example, Charlton Hinman long ago showed that compositors would divide their copy into lines to suit their own convenience -- i.e. to take up more or less space as the process of ""casting off"" required."
1,Too Complicated,"I had to reaturn it because it was just too complicated. Also, my professor told me to get a folio that was from photographs. She said that the punctuation is really important and we can't tell if a typographical mistake was made in 2001 or in the 1600s. She said the best one was the hard cover one by Norton and the next best was the paper back one by Routledge.A New York Actress"
2,A disappointment.,"I really didn't find much new information in this book, and it was somewhat of a disappointment. I'm passing it along to my in-laws as they might be able to save some money on some of the hints pertaining to their activities and hobbies. I probably wouldn't buy this book again if given the opportunity."
2,Nothing Unique Here,"This book seems very outdated and you will be much better off by investigating your local Senior Citizens Organizations, Human Services, and Clinics and Doctors will give you today's benefits that can be extremely helpful to Seniors, especially free meds, etc. You don't need to jump through hoops to get onto free med situations and don't have to deal directly with the Pharm. companies. Today you can get aid to do this for you. Just dig into your local Human Services and one lead seems to lead to another, and so on. Sorry, but this contains methods to help that were in print back in the 70's. Do a little work yourself and you'll be amazed how much up to date aid you can receive which is based on Today's Opportunities."
1,Don't spend your money,"Sadly, this book has no good deals and/or free stuff, I got better information from the AARP website and that's free. Save your money! this book is not worth it!!!"
2,free stuff,Thought I would use this a lot but have found it not to be as useful becasue of its general nature.
2,A Good Deal,"Most of the songs on this CD come from Melanie's album "" Sunset and Other Beginnings"". The album, sadly, was not one of Melanie's best. "" I've Got My Mojo Working"" does not suit Melanie's style or voice. It sounds forced. "" What Do I Keep"" should have been a classic, but the song is too long and at one point her voice loses its pitch. ""Almost Like Being in Love"" sounds like elevator music. The album is backed by musicians that clearly do not want to be there. However, there are some bright spots, mainly "" The Sun And The Moon"", "" Where's The Band"" and "" Sandman."" The rest of the album is tired and listless. It's a shame too because Melanie's voice was in fine form. This does not reflect Melanie's superb writing. It's almost a wasted effort."
3,Skip it unless you're a hardcore Elissa fan,"While this CD has some strong tracks, there is no big hit on the scope of Baddy Doub, Aayshalak, Bitrooh, or Shiltak from her other efforts. If your preference is for upbeat, pop-inspired songs such as Diana Haddad's, ""Shater"" and Samira Saeed's ""Youm Wara Youm,"" then there's not a lot here for you. The mournful, soulful, lugubrious ballads, however, are aplenty. The best track and closest to her previous smash hits is probably ""Koul Youm Fee Oumri"" which will definitely get your feet tapping. ""Bein Il Ein"" and ""Zekra"" are also very listenable. The CD closes fairly strongly with the Spanish acoustic guitar background for ""Law Nirjaa Sawa."" Absent, and missing in my opinion, are any duets with Ragheb Alameh. All in all though, I was just a little disappointed. Perhaps ""Koul Youm Fee Oumri"" will grow on me in time."
4,Great Celtic CD,"This CD sounds more ""celtic"" than other celtic CDs I've heard. I like the lyrics of the songs, especially ""In My Weakness"" and ""God Above, God Below."" After listening to it, I went and got a bunch more to give as gifts to friends and family."
3,"Good Beats,Good Lyrics,But where the F*CK is Dylan",I was really wanting to give this one 4 stars.Until I listened to it a 2nd time.I dont understand why Dylan isnt on the cd too much.Even when I was watching the show I thought Dylan was doing an alright Job. P. Diddy is too much of an ass who thinks the songs have to be perfect for it to be a hit.And I also have to say that If it were not for Fred and Chopper (More-so Fred)Da Band would not be anything.Dont get me wrong though.Its got Good Beats and Lyrics.But Its just a matter of time before Fred goes solo.
1,MAKE IT STOP!!!!!,HONESTLY... IM DISSAPOINTED IN DIDDY. THIS CD IS CRAP AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING AMAZING. THE ONLY THING AMAZING ABOUT THE ENTIRE THING IS SARA. SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT OUT WHILE SHE HAD THE CHANCE AND BECOME A SOLO ARTIST. PLEASE... PLEASE... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. ITS SOOOO NOT WORTH IT.
4,DA BAND IS HOTTTTTT!,"I love Bad Boy Records. I love all the artists. Da Band has their own style and each member is different in their own way. I reaaaally like how they sound and how they act, they are great. P Diddy is also a good part are this band, i love him. DYLANNNN IS THE MANNNN!"
3,Hmmm,"I really expected this album to be better than what I heard overall. I think each artist is very talented and that they each should have a solo album or collaborate with just 1 or 2 people. This whole group of 6 people does not mesh well when it comes to blending people who choose to keep their own style(not a bad thing). But as a group they don't have any style to them.Another thing, it seems as though they put Sarai in songs just because she was a part of the group. I felt some songs would have been better if she was not in them. I'm not saying she doesn't sound good, but the song would have sounded better if it was just rap instead of rap and r&b."
5,Making The Band II- Making a Hit Record,"I copped the album a few days before it hit stores, and I thought it was hot! Babs truly showed herself as a talented MC, not just as a female MC. Freddy Pee and Young City (formerly Chopper) also ripped this cd into shreds! I personally like Ness's style because he has that 'Philly' sound, and I like his flow. Sara came correct with the vocals, and put everything into place. I recommend that you buy this cd, if you haven't already done so! And if you already did, you're 2 steps ahead of the game."
1,lawd . . .,how long do we have to witness the death of real music? Mess like this should be outlawed.
1,THIS BAND SUCKS.,This cd will sell records only because of mtv promoting theatrics.Lets all be honest and say what we truly feel.This album was rushed and the quality of the music as a whole shows it.Out of countless tracks there are probably only 2 worthwhile songs.They are mediocre at best rappers with poor studio production.What else can we expect from a loser like poop diddy who will do anything for money?DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!
4,pleased,I love this cd and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
2,Do Better next time,Now don't get me wrong all of them can rap.(And you can sign Sarah). But this album wouldn't even be looked at if they didn't have that t.v. show. I want to give this album a higher score but there is something big missing from it. I don't know what but something all albums have. And some songs on here sound the same. Maybe ya'll do better next time. D-A B-A-N-D!!
3,okay for TV,Okay...when I read the fan from Philly's review I had to laugh......You said Ness was the best? And philly has it like that...you sound silly. Ness is a studio gangsta that went to Central High in Philly? He is a prep school thug...no respect from me with any of his fake hard lyrics! I know Philly could have done better....with you? I dont think so. You were not in DA Band because you missed auditions? You would not have even made it in the building of Bad Boy and I work there.Now on to some reality....without jocking Philly! This cat just downed everyone and gave props to the one Philly artist!The group is cool. Sarah is tight on the album and Dylan gives it some extra flair. Babs just sounds like another Brooklyn hood rat and Young City sounds like Cash Money...another studio thug. Fred has the tightest flow on the album.1
3,Nothing,"Why do they have to put every single person on Do You Know? It could've been Dylan's time to shine, but he only had about 20 seconds to work with. Also, Babs is not hard and is NOT LIL' KIM, and Fred definitely does not have a Bentley Azzure as he claims in Do You Know."
3,WHY Not 5 Stars?,"This CD is good, that's about it. It's very repetitive and I can't distingish between tracks, it just all blends together. Dylan is on like 3 songs, and I think he has a great style. So does Chopper (the tightest) and Fred (the most unique)....Ness sucks compared to them. Babs is tight. Sara brings a good R&B undertone to the songs. Buy it if you liked them on the show..."
4,Pretty good,"This cd is Hot and has pretty good beats. I must admit, I didn't think the lyrics were all that but when I listened to it the second time around, it didn't sound too bad. On the show Fred talked about leaving the band... I really hope he doesn't. He brings life and personality to the band and in my own opinion, I think he's the best rapper out of the group. Anyway as I said before the beats are pretty Hot so go get the CD. I'm sure glad I did, and I love it."
4,great album,"i picked it up from the store and to tell the truth, they have more skill than i thought. For the amount of time they had to make the album i think they did a good job. The next ""da band"" album should really make them stars"
3,Not Bad!,"The Album was entertaining. P.Diddy did a Incredible job with the group and once again shows his hunger for succes.These young cats have what it takes to maintain as a solid group in this industry specialy under the wing of P. Diddy he always makes ""Rap groups"" succesfull."
2,G-A-R-A-B-A-GGGEEEE,"Ok, i seriously haent heard the whole cd, but i just wanted to say ""G-A-R-A-G-A-GGGGGEEEEEE"". I have heard some songs off of this disc. And I wasen't impressed. Its a good concept to put all the people with the different parts and styles together but i guess it looks better on paper then it does recorded because the parts dont fit together well. I think if some of the members went solo it might turn out alittle better."
2,Oh what could have been..,"I will keep this one short and sweet....the potential for greatness is (or was) there, but is not realized on this CD. Lets face it...Da Band is a pop band with a hip hop face. I bought the CD because I felt somewhat of a kenship to them, but the music itself points out the true nature of what Da Band is made for....future (mostly unsucessful) solo careers. There is no need to review every individual song because you hear the same one on every track. If you have to have Bad Boy This, Bad Boy That as your opening single...you know it can only go downhill from there."
3,The Band produces an average album,"Now i loved the show so much and watched every episode season 1 and 2 but the album wasn't just for me. There are a few good songs and those are: Tonight (2nd single), Bad Boy This Bad Boy That(1st single), Living Legends,and Do you know. The curses were outrageous!! But anyway its a good album and cheers to the D.A. B.A.N.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!! holla & p.diddy"
5,Da Band Album is BANGING!!!!!,"The CD, Too Hot 4 TV, is off the hook fa sho. When I bought it, I couldn't wait to listen to it. Even though Sara and Dylan wasn't in every song, I was still great. When Mr. Bentley Freestyled on this CD, you kno he did it. Oh My Best Favorite Song(s) was My Life, Living Legends, Tonight, What We Gonna Do, Why, Bad Boy This, Bad Boy That, Do YOu Know, Cheers to Mr. Bentley, and Go Steady. If I was you I would buy this CD, 200%."
1,Da Band is not Dat Good,"Da Band CD is a disappointment to me the only good songs is Bad Boy This, Bad Boy That and Why. Well basically as long as Freddy is rappin most of it those are the only good ones so dont get it unless you really like them because now I dont!"
5,Rawest hip hop of the year.,"Raw hip hop, and I'm proud to recognize it.Every one of the members has a distinctive and respectable talent. I think that the overwhelming amount of jealousy, and hating on Da Band is disgusting.Maybe it's just the fact I share the same dream, of being an ill lyricist, and the fact I want to be on reality television too, but I can identify.I like the album, I like the emcees. I'll give it a dope review. I think it's a diamond covered in dirt type deal. I give this album five stars because the future looks bright."
4,Solid CD,"This is a good CD. The production is on point by Puffy's team, and lyrically, the team does a good job. Don't expect a blockbuster, but expect to be entertained. It's been in my changer for weeks."
2,Think about it?,I thougut the cd was going to be good I saw them on the tv show they were off the chain but now I waisted my money and my time buying and listening to that crap. Chopper solo is garbage. Babs hella garbage. Fred cool. E. Ness hella props u got mad flows. Dylan awful GIVE IT UP. Sara singing is awesome. But together is garbage do not waste your money on this album please.E. Ness go solo they messing you up.
2,Puffy ruined it,Puffy's control freak habits destroyed an incredible ensemble with a lot of raw talent. Instead of letting the rappers perform from their hearts he wanted them to rap the way HE wanted them to sound. That pretty much destroyed the fire of the group. It sounds like the album was rushed and the verses sound copy and pasted to the tracks. Hip hop is about individuality and originality. When you dont have those its all garbage. The only person Puffy didnt seem to control all the time is Ness. Thats why I gave this CD 2 stars because of Ness performance.
1,Da Band - just plain sucks!,"I love rap but what a bunch of talentless wannabees!After MTV runs this show into the ground for a few more seasons, Da Band will eventually and thankfully just dissappear. In a year or two, you'll find all the members of da band working in fast food joints or in jail.Anything for a buck I guess - Puffy don't you have any shame? What a bunch of uneducated, ungrateful group of losers - Damn!"
3,its OK and that's it,"Well, I said I wasn't going to buy it but I did. After seeing them fight I said this is unbelievable. But I wanted to see what they came up with. Like someone else said, it is too many people on every song. I heard Ness on #2 and I was feeling it but then they cut it with Fred talkin bout sellin crack and some other nonsense. It was down hill from there.Ness is the best. He's from Philly so I mean of course. We got it like that. Dylan is corny and we tall did. Babes is corny but I think she seemed to have the best attitudes despite how ghetto she was actin. Ennn, Fred is ok. The girl that sings the hooks wit mcdonalds shaped eyebrows is aight.... At least she's goodlooking. Choppa is corny. He sounds like a wannabe Cash Money member. I rap better than him but I didn't get a chance to audition! All in all, I like #2, #6 is ok, and #13. Everything else is just another song. Don't listen to the CD too much you get tired of it quick."
3,V-man,"This was a disapointment to me. I chose to buy Obie's album over this and I made the right choice. They should have gotten some top notch producers like Timbaland, Neptunes, Kanye West, and lil' Jon. Tony Dofat, who produced this album, is aight but aint nothing special compared to those I mentioned. ""Why"" is the best track but I already heard that song 4 months ago. Stubborn A** puffy didnt wanna pay for the good producers and now they are stuck with an average album. And that Wyclef song is stright up WACK."
1,Why I have a question Puff?,"You have all this money and your show is run on MTV the question is with all the talent in this country with rappers who are right now nobodies but can rap why did you not pick 5 of those people and believe me there are 5 out of 5,000 that can rap.well get those 5 rappers put them over some DJ Premier beats RZA-HAVOC-DRE and let them kill it.In this instance you have some bad rappers with some truly god awful female singers that have no Talent then you make some stupid videos no tight ones all club or booty or whatever videos and you waste money on these idiots with no talent.Lyrics 3/10 Production 5/10 X Factor 1/10 Classic 1/10 Me 1/10Overall=11/50 This one gets a 22% This is seriosly terrible"
1,da crap,"This is the upmost worst musically talented music group ever put togeather in the world, the t.v. show is just as horrible as the music, puff Daddy Your Ill but you screwed up with this music group. you got a fat R&B singer fat as in wideload and a bunch of clowns that can't rhyme"
5,THIS IS THE S***,"This album is hot!! I had this CD for weeks, and I just love it. P. Diddy worked this group into a very respectable art form. I love all the songs on here. Especially ""Tonight"" and ""Hold Me Down"". It put all the rest of the artists to shame. I have already heard E-40, OutKast, Ludacris, Obie Trice. None of them can compare to this group. Out of all the fights I've seen on MTV, I really hope that they stay together. My fav are Sara, Babs and Freddrick. YOU WILL BE SURPRISED!! I sure was."
1,Fred WHY?,"Fred has potenially said the dumbest rhyme ever! lol On the song ""WHY"" Fred said ""I'M FROM THE DIRTY WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE PRICE OF SOAP/I'M A STAR LOOK IN THE SKY U NEED A MICROSCOPE/"" A MICROSCOPE? U mean a TELESCOPE don't u kid! lol Fred u my boy but d*mn!! Don't talk about stuff u know nothin about. Stick to what u know best. And even P. Diddy remastered the track and he didn't noticed that! No one noticed. So what does that tell ya. U make the call. This album should get a 1 star just for that alone! lol But if this review wasn't helpful check out my other one!"
1,5 seconds of samples,"the five seconds of each sample, is pathetic. This band has no flavour, nothing to rap about, no uniqueness, no vibe, no bounce. Nothing but just piss in a cup.give me 5 sec's of fame... give anybody 5 sec's of fame and they could easily write anything better than this.Can't wait for the second album... Puffy you must be regretting this MTV experience."
3,I'm actually scared to listen to this!!!,"The, uh, excuse me, DA Band performed at my school back in October and maybe it's because they're new and all, but for me and the majority of the people at the concert, they reeked. I try not to be one of those people who buys music off of The Hype. Which is why I didn't purchase this cd. I'm not a rap fan, and I think for me, Da Band's popularity is greatly due to MTV. I think if that show ends, Da Band ends.Ness and Sara are the only two I like. Although, I feel Sara is very out of place as the only singer the group.I heard that Da Band has a new album coming out soon. We'll see how that goes. I don't see them going but so far with this. I think this is an example of Sean Combs' (who I now can't stand) ego trippin' out"
2,just download the the hit,the only thing about thew cd that is good is the beatscome on it stupid to put all of the group on one songit sounds wackhow u hear one person on a song singing good and another raping wackthe hit song has a good beat and stick up is a good song
2,Album Sucks,"Lets be honest, i got this album because i watched the tv show and they sounded good, but as soon as i picked up the cd i was so disappointed. Dont buy this album, there raps suck and they sound like children. I dont know what these people are talking about who say this album is good, this must not know anything about rap..So please dont ""cop"" (what a dumb word) this album"
3,Heres the deal,"This CD has a bunch of average songs but there are three that I thought were tight. Bad Boy This Bad Boy That, Do you Know, and Tonight. These are of course the songs chosen to be called the hits by the record company but I think the best song has got to be Do you know. Sara Stokes gets to show off her vocals and all the raps are catchy. I think the hot thing about the album is that each member brings different ideas and influences to the tracks. Album loses stars mainly because the rest of the 18 tracks remind me of every other rap album out there. Give them credit people! Just because they were on MTV Making the Band doesn't mean you have to hate on them."
5,Da Band is Da Best,I love Too Hot For T.V. I think the album's title fits the group well. I loved the show on MTV. I was a huge fan so I had very high expectations for this album. It turned out to be everything I thought it was going to be. I can't wait to hear Too Hot For T.V. 2 which is what I've heard is the title of the next album.
5,Da Band is HOT,I just got Too Hot for TV and it is hot.It is the first CD I can listen to all the way through since Mary J Blidge's Share My World.I watch them go from 6 people who did'nt know each other to a family I am so proud of them.And to Fred I would love to come the MIA and kick it my treat
3,room to grow...but not that bad,"This cd has it's ups and downs...but believe me it is alot better then its gettin credit for on here...they havent been together that long so you cant expect it to be perfect...Its a lil diferent because there are so many diferent styles in each song...but that makes it diferent from everything else so im my opinoin thats a plus for this cd...but overall you really have to be a rap fan to appreciate this cd...the best songs are: MY LIFE, GO STEADY, I LIKE YOUR STYLE"
4,BAD BOY IS BACK...Wait they never left!!!!,"Okay I have to say after I saw the show I said this group cant even sit in a room for five minutes without fighting...but leave it in the hands of Mr. Diddy. This cd is honestly a really good piece of work for their first release. It takes it back to the good ole Bad Boy Days when it was about partying and dancing and not gun busting and rap wars. So if u want a break from everyone dissing each other and talking about who is tougher, whose gun is bigger, AND JUST WANT TO DANCE AND CHILL...PICK THIS CD UP!!! Overall the cd is really good but the stand out tracks are: (Hold Me Down),(Tonight) (What we gonna do tonight), (Do you know), (Bad Boy This Bad Boy That), and for u R&B lovers (Go Steady)"
4,This CD is hot....,"i'm not sure what i was expecting...but i wasn't expecting this album to be this good. da band did an outstanding job on this first release. i was surprised myself. babs laid it down, and kept it real, fred acting an ass and showed out and came through hard, and choppa well what can i say about chop he held it down. ness was present and dylan can just hang it up, and sara held the vocals down clean. da band is a def. pick up, i'm feeling it and you know they have tight beats, heck its produced by none other than p.diddy. pick up the band today. on a scale of 1 to 10 i would give this cd a def. 7."
4,My baby choppa holdz it down!!!!!,"""crissy poppa, mix it with the hen and vocka; see I'm the king of the jungle call me Mufasa.,"" that verse is so sick!!!! number 5 on the album. Chop, Fred, Babs, Sara, Ness, all held it down like whoa. big ups to DA band and I hope yall stick together and continue making them head bangaz.A GO GETTER FO SHO. IF YA AIN'T GOT IT THEN GO GET IT!!!!!!"
4,HOT CD!!!!!!!!!,Overall this is a HOT CD..there are about 2 songs that are just ok but I rarely like each and every song on a CD anyway. Babs...FIRE!!! Fred...FIRE!!!! Ness...Good Lyrics...good voice...dig his style. Dylan....He is ok but he adds a lil something to the group...he is doggone sure the rebel but with time he might be a LIVING LEGEND...Sara...sexy Sara does her thang...I am feeling the Mid-West swing. Please go out and support Da Band..that means go to the store and get the CD...no boot-leggers....
4,Thank You MTV,"Gotta thank MTV for allowing P. Diddy to put together an act on their show Making The Band. And giving the world a With that out of the way, these six youngstas ain't playin. They are real with their lyrical skill and about to make enough cheddar to pay all the bills. (Alright, I ain't ready for the Making the Band.) Too Hot for TV ain't perfect, there are many misses (such as ""Living Legends"") on this one but the tracks that do hit, HIT HARD!!! Take the two bangers, ""Tonight"" and ""Hold Me Down."" The former is a little sexy joint and the latter displays the five MCs' best verbal exercises on the whole CD - and, on top of that, the beat is wicked. ""Go Steady"" is the one R&B joint on the CD and displays Sara's hummingbird-like voice and shows why P. Diddy added her to Da Band. These make up the three best tracks on the album. Overall, the debut from Da Band is a success!!!"
3,wat i xpected,da band cd was an ok first cd....i wasnt expectin ready to die or illmatic but i am kinda upset that Ness Dylan and Fred did not have solo tracks..seein how they r the best lyrical artist in the group in terms of creativity...chopper sounds like a bad combo of lil Wayne and Turk...Sara did her thang and babs is garbage.....but we all kno puffy can make sumthin outta nuthin...nex albulm...more gutter...less boyfriend girlfriend tracks..more fred ness n dylan
4,Gripping,"Being from PA and no stranger to the AT I found this book intriguing. The reader is drawn in and bears witness to a senseless crime and it's aftermath. Ms. Brenner's description of the day of the incedent,from camping to shooting to escape is heartstopping. I guess my only disappointment in this book was my desparate need to know why Carr shot at Brenner and Wight in the first place. His defense tried to use the excuse that the sight of 2 lesbians being intimate was enough to insight violence. Especially if you were sexually abused as a child. I just couldn't make the connection with that excuse. We are never really privy to the truth. Though I suppose neither were Brenner and Wight."
4,Efficient Problem Solver.,Following a few years of significant algae growth in the spring we purchased on of these for our 200 gal pond. Well after 4 daily filter cleanings we have crystal clear water. The filter media is easy to reach and the whole cleaning operation can be completed in 15 minutes. Made in the USA... which is always a surprise now days.
4,filter,"I have 2 ponds and live in a warm climate. This is the third filter that I have bought. It is has a great water flow and is easy to clean. I have had two of the three filters for five years and with regular cleaning, they do their job in the pond. I recommend this filter for people with turtles as they create more waste than fish."
3,Okay for small pond,I sent this back because it was really only useful in a very small pond and would not stand straight up.
4,Good for those times between full pump use,"I have to turn my waterfall/ pond pump off over the winter to keep it from freezing. I hate not to have the water circulating all winter though and this small unit is the answer. It is easy to drop into the pond and have a small fountain putting oxygen into the water. It keeps the water clear, too. The only challenge I had was that it wouldn't stay down and I needed to weigh it down and secure the fountain part. It fall over if the wind is strong."
2,small decorative pond water pump,"Seems to pump as advertised. The tubing going from filter to spout is to short and not as flexible as it should be. Also the spout length is not adjustable in small amounts. Cutting off the end to make shorter is not an option. At least if they would have supplied a coupling, (standard coupling in CPC will not work)you could cut out a section. Also you have to find a way to weight the pump and spout down or it will not stay straight. Sorry but this is a poor design."
3,cord,"I bought it because of the cord length. I did read this was someone elses complaint, but I thought it would still reach my outlet......I was wrong."
2,Misleading and poorly designed,"I ordered this pond filter because of the pump cord length, which claims to be 18'. It is NOT 18', it is only 8'. Now I must use an extension cord and it will cause an unprotected connection outdoors.Also, the pipe that connects from the filter box to the pump slides on so easily that it does not have a water tight fit and any bump will dislodge the connection. I can teflon tape the connection and it very well may seal better, but I don't feel I should have to do these things for a brand new setup. Also, the filter box part is difficult to keep submerged. I tried one rock and needed a second to keep it down.The price is good and I am very familiar with the Mag-Drive pumps, which are excellent pumps."
4,"After some issues, finally received","This book was a favorite of my youngest daughter and had been lost in the shuffle of life, so I was happy to see it listed for sale.After ordering, I eagerly anticipated it's arrival and the book came early, but...IT WAS THE WRONG BOOK. Same Title, Wrong book.I was very disappointed (well, you might say a wee bit upset :/ ) but Amazon credited my account and sent the correct book. It arrived very quickly and was in great shape."
2,send what you show,Ordered this book for my soon to be grandaughter. I ordered what was shown because it was the same as that we read to my daughter. Got a completely different book.
3,Shortened version,"While still a wonderful book to read a kid, this version is missing segments from when I was a child. I had this book memorized when I was six, and two of my favorite parts (Kitten's putting on her clothes, getting dressed from head to toes . . . and There's Mother Bear and Father Bear but where is baby?) are simply not in this copy. It is a little bit of a disappointment. Older copies may have those rhymes.My daughter, however, is none the wiser and now loves to play ""Our puppy dogs are missing! Whatever shall we do?"" with her stuffed animals. She is 20 months."
5,My all time fav,"I grew up in Hawaii and this was the only Char Siu sauce my family and friends ever used. Now that I'm living in Louisiana I have to get it shipped here. I've tried so many different brands of Char Siu sauce while living here and none can compare...not even close. So simple to use. I just place chicken thighs in a pot, pour the sauce over, add a little water and cook on med heat until the chicken is super tender. This is the best stuff!"
5,Excellent product,"We recently switched our older dog to this food because the small size made it easier for him to chew and digest. We have noticed a big improvement in his coat and activity level since. If you are feeding your pets cheap food, try this. You'll probably notice quite a change."
4,what comedy central should have done,"This CD is the soundtrack to the TV show. In Britain these tracks are played over the clips where no talking is involved such as 'dog wars' and my favorite, the clowns and cream pies, it gives the show a whole different slant. However Comedy Central replaced all of these with a generic soundtrack that is laughable. Get a copy of the british DVD, the juxtaposition of music and images can make you cry as well as laugh. or buy this cd and turn the sound down on your tv."
1,Terrible Illustrations,"Despite what is shown on the ""Look Inside"" feature, the illustrations inside this edition are BLURRY, black & white copies of the originals. Very disappointing! This amounts to false advertising. I'm returning it."
3,Door into the hills,"Lucy is a human character introduced to the Peter Rabbit series, has a bad habit of losing her pocket-handkerchiefs and this time she lost 3. She search for it high and low but couldn't find them anywhere. But what she found something else in the hills while searching and it is a door going straight into the hill.There, she meets an intriguing character with ""hairpins"" sticking out of her back who calls herself Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, who happens to be a washerwomen for all of the other animals. Turned out her missing hankies and pinny are being wash by Mrs Tiggy-Winkle.This is an interesting book and my favorite part is the ever so questions answered with ""it you please'em"". Beautiful colourful illustration to enjoy. Weird storyline though but it's an interesting non the less. Kids owuld enjoy this with an awe. Not a keeper but it's a good read."
4,odd story,"i do not understand what this was supposed to accomlish as a children`s story. it seemed very far&#12540;fecth`d from a story about imaginatio, but the incorperation of miss tiggywinkle washing the animal`s &#65378;paws&#65379; was pretty cute and interesting."
2,No pictures,"The text is fine and the book is free, so that's good. But the charm of Beatrix Potter is in her illustrations which this version of the book does not include."
1,Poorly Written,"This book was required by my professor so I had to buy it. It is probably one of the worst textbooks I have ever used. I found the writing poorly phrased and there were a few inconsistencies with the Code. (constructive receipt, etc)"
2,West Federal Taxation,"West Federal Taxation was a textbook for a class I was taking in preparation for the Certified Financial Planner's Exam. While I got an A in the course, it was no thanks to this text book. In some areas the text seemed to ramble and skip around a lot making the subject matter difficult to comprehend. Then again, we are talking about the bureaucratic nightmare that is the US Tax Code. I found I needed to supplement the material in this book with tutorial materials I found on the IRS website to gain better comprehension. If you're stuck using West Federal Taxation as a textbook I would suggest you become familiar with the IRS website to really learn the subject matter."
3,I never received the book. Just a refund b/c it was out of stock.,"About 1 1/2 weeks after I purchased the book, I received an email from the seller stating that the book is out of stock and he will refund me.I had to drop my class b/c of this and I will never order a school textbook on Amazon again."
4,Good condition por the price but....,"The delivery of the book was fast, the book was in perfect conditions, BUT it did not include the CD (turbo tax softare) so just pay attention when ordering a book to make sure it comes with all the necessary.But overall it was a good purchase."
4,Works!,"What can I say about a pet feeder? It's great if I'm going away for a few days and want to make sure my cat has plenty to eat. However, if I leave it there all the time, he turns into a pig and just keeps eating and eating."
2,Alright,Doesn't fill up very nice with my cat food I feed nutro natural choice it is not a large cat food but it doesn't fill up very well I am going to try and modify it
3,It doesn't work well with flat kibble.,"It probably works better with the round kibble. The food doesn't flow from the hopper. Even after I propped up the back, I still have to shake it down."
3,A bit of a disappointment,The lid does not really fit correctly. This is the second one that I purchased and I gave the first one away and ordered another without any reserve...It arrived and is not the same quality as the first.
2,cat feeder,"lid or container is not a tight, secure fit.sorta flimsy and rather large for a cat or two...I like the size b/c i have four cats"
3,Not so great,"It would be good, except for the top clear container does not fit properly into the grey bottom part, no matter what I try, so it's loose and can easily pull apart and spill food out."
3,Product fine but....,The product is what I wanted but they didn't ship the lid for the top of the food container. Trying now to find out how to contact shipper and try to get the lid.
4,Easy to clean.,Nice size for small animals and easy to disassemble and clean. Minus one star for being just plain ugly.
1,Careless Company - Bergan Petite Gourmet Feeder-6 pounds,"My prior review said I would order from this company again. NOT SO - just opened box to give to the person I purchased this for and find the Feeder is MISSING THE TOP LID.I carefully examined the shipping box and the mile-long length of scrunched up brown paper used as a cushioning agent - NO LID.There is no way to protect the dry food contents from either the weather or animals trying to eat from the top instead of the bowl. VERY CARELESS SHIPPER QUALITY CONTROL.Amazon web site is not user friendly and there seems to be no way to file a complaint or request the missing piece other than a ""return"" or even to contact company once the order was shipped. So $16.42 down the drain and no useable feeder. BEWARE products from MMP LLC company. I will try to buy from a different company or perhaps locally."
5,Huge,I fit my huge bag of cat food in this. No need to store that huge bag! My cats love it and the food never got stuck coming out of the lid. I bought this for vacation but it holds the food for a month for my kitty. Very nice!
3,Short and violent,"This game has some really good graphics and story. It doesn't last long and the sound is OK. Gameplay is repetative and isn't all that great. Very good rental. If you like the movie, check this out."
2,bad button masher,"If you like mindless action and button mashing, you'll like this. I found the action repetitive. The graphics, so-so. I thought this would be like a gladiator dueling game. It's definitely not. It's roman gladiator (using many out of period weapons) meets bruce lee from that scene in Enter the Dragon where he fights 100 guards. Really lame.Shadow Over Rome looks cooler."
3,OPPO OPDV971H,"- I purchased this player to interface with my 4-year old Panasonic PLT 300U LCD Projector (1/4 HD) which has DVI but is not HDCP compliant.-- It would only sync at 720P and even that had image problems.-- The component picture looked a little washed-out.- The projector synced fine with my old LG LST 3510A at 1080I or 720P (component)so I believe it was not a bandwidth issue.- Amazon has a great return policy (free shipping, return and full refund) so I sent it back. I'm looking at the Helios 4000 so I can upconvert over component because I can' find another non-HDCP compliant DVI DVD player (upconverting)."
5,Perfect DVD Player for International Traveler,"I often travel to Europe and Asia and when I purchase DVD's there and play them on my Sony DVD player in the USA, I encounter numerous issues including region code restrictions and PAL encoding, but the Oppo DVD player allows me to watch pretty much any DVD I want. The player's default is region 1 but there is an easy software fix that can be found on Amazon and online.My only complaint is the player will reset to the beginning of the disc if you turn it off. Oppo support offered a workaround by ejecting the disc and turning the player off, but this is a bit inefficient for such a basic feature. Do not let this deter you though, this is the best dvd player out there by far!"
5,Everything you'd expect,This is great. I did my homework on the secrets to home theatres in this was rated tops. I play every format in it with very little problem.
2,Not ready for prime time.,"Produced great picture quality, but the remote is awful and the user interface is really, really bad. It upscales well and shows very little macroblocking for a Farouja chip machine, but I returned it in favor of the Sony offering."
2,AMAZON & OPPO SERVICES REVIEWS NOT THE DEVICE,"THE DVD PLAYER WORKS GREAT WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND THE TRICKS TO HAVE IT SET-UP: THE RATING OF THIS DVD PLAYER IS 5 OUT OF 5AMAZON WAS NOT HELPFULL AT ALL. MY RATING FOR AMAZON: 1 OUT OF 5.OPPO WAS QUITE HELFULL EXCEPT THAT I AM FRUSTRATED TO HAVE BOUGHT A DEVICE WHERE THE MANUAL DOES NOT INDICATE HOW TO CONNECT IT TO A STANDARD TV BOUGHT LESS THAN 6 MONTHS AGO (LG PLASMA 52"")THE TRICK WAS TO HAVE THE SOUND. I HAD TO FIGURE OUT AND TO BUY A SPECIAL CABLE (WITH A MINI-JACK) AT RADIOSHACK FOR $25.SUCH A CABLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PACKAGE. READING THE RATING FROM OTHER OPPO CUSTOMERS, I SAW THAT OPPO WAS SOMETIMES SUPPLYING MISSING CABLE.I WAS HOPPING TO BE A LUCKY GUY TOO! MY RATING FOR OPPO: 3 OUT OF 5"
1,no tint control; video controls didn't work.,"I bought this when my 10-year old JVC player crapped out, and thought I could get one that would last another 10 and get me into the HDTV era. I returned it because the video controls didn't work (brightness / saturation / contrast). There is also no control for tint(red/green) either, something my JVC had. I am baffled by that.It's possible I didn't have video in the right mode for the controls to work but it wasn't evident in the manual, which in my opinion wasn't formatted very well (the remote display probably had a #6 font for the button labels - not for us old guys, and you have to page back to the remote display and guess what the instructions are talking about).But the fact that there is no tint control was enough for me to return it."
2,Would Not Recommend,"I purchased the OPPO OPDV971H DVD player, connected it to my Panasonic high definition plasma set via the DVI connector, set the player to 720P, inserted a disc, but the player would NOT play the disc. I set it to 1080i, same result. The player would play the disc at 480i, but that's not why I bought it.I returned it within four days and bought another up converting player that works fine, though it costs more.Would not recommend this player."
1,Used,The player showed up in used condition. It was sent back to Amazon from someone else. I never even plugged it in. Retured it the next day very disappointed. I have not ordered a replacement.
5,Oppo DVD player,"I was impressed. I bought it mainly for the analog audio outputs, but the moment I opened the box, my jaw just dropped. I've never seen a product so meticulously packaged. It came in a soft cloth bag like cover, and it included the cables (1 DVI, 1 HDMI, 1 RCA). Personally, I use the S-Video output, to connect to an Electrohome projector. The image quality is unbelievable, and for the money, it's most likely one of the best deals out there. Enjoy, you'll thank me later."
5,Great Performance and Customer Service,"The quality of the 971H's on screen display is outstanding. You can see the difference. Especially noteworthy is OPPO's customer service. Even on a Saturday I was able to contact a real live person. I was in the process of attaching the OPPO 971H to a newly acquired Sony Bravia LCD. Ambiguities in Sony documentation prevented the combination from working. The OPPO tech support guy had the documentation for my Sony receiver, and he immediately identified and solved the problem. Whey can't all tech support be this good?"
1,Build Quality is Questionable,After having this play for two days it decided not to eject a disk additionally it only shows a blue screen now much like Microsoft's blue screen of death. The picture was great when it worked but that was not for long.
5,incredible,"well got mine today and it is without a doubt the best deal in electronics period.top notch in image quality.in my opinion it looks better than some shows on directv hd,and i am very particular about picture quality.anyone that even remotely is thinking about a dvd player at this time do not hesitate,buy this piece immediately.the box,the packaging,everything about the oppo package is very good.forget 3 stars about this or 4 stars about that for 200 bucks this machine is a steal.make sure you have a quality set to truly take advantage of it.and you must activate the up conversion.the sound is also very good,i wish it were black but that is about the only thing i would change.hope this helps anyone considering buying this player."
5,Great Find,"Chicago Trib spotlighted this product & they were right. Produces wonderful video, high quality device,compete manual, and live, knowledgeable tech support to walk you through any special hookups."
4,oppo,"i doubted the fact that this dvd player would create a high def picture re-creation, but i took the plunge anyway. on newer and higher quality dvd's, it did just that. popped in i, robot and kicked back and relaxed. thought i was indeed watching in high def the whole time. i had to actually watch a true hd channel to tell a difference between the two. it has lived up to my expectations...........btw, i have a 65"" hitachi ultravision widescreen display. one negative, i hate watching ""widescreen only"" movies. ""anamorphic widesceen"" is what you want in a dvd, otherwise there will be stretching/shrinking issues."
3,I couldn't see any difference!,"Hooked this DVD player via DVI to my Hitachi 1080i HDTV 65-inch 65SWX20B, which itself had an internal 1080i upconverter. No significant difference when compared it to my Sony DVD player/SACD player DVP-NC685V. Returned it to Amazon. Got a full refund (thanks Amazon.) No problems with operating the OPDV971H, however. Waiting for the Toshiba HD-A2."
5,fantastic dvd player for the money,"I only used it a couple of times before mine was stolen, but it was great and worked flawlessly, the tray appears a little flimsy, but not so weak to bother me."
5,Excellent buy for under $200,"This player has certainly changed the way I watch video. Not only is it a wonderful DVD player, it also plays a wide range of video files, including Divx and mpg files. The video quality is great and the audio quality is better than most players in this range. A friend of mine is selling his Cambridge DVD player to get the OPPO instead."
5,Good Quality Player for a great price!,"After using the player for 4 months, I've experinced no problems and it has played all of my DVD's,divx,avi's,etc. Still having troubles really determing the difference between HD-up converting through DVI or HDMI and regular component video output. Aside from that I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Very Good to Excellent Upconverting DVD Player but...,5/5 on the Video upconversion to 1080i but the filmsy DVD tray broke within hours.
5,Best thing out there until True HD,"I recently purchased the OPPO DVD player and am very impressed. I had tried several other upconvreting players, the Samsung 845 and LG, and was not impressed. However, the quality from the Oppo is excellent. I have the Oppo connected to my HDMI port and running in 720P, although its not quite up to HD quality it is very good. The other units I have tried out produced a somewhat noisy and washed out picture but not the Oppo! Picture quality was clean and vibrant. Newer DVD's like Star Wars and the Fifth Element looked almost HD quality. Older DVD's looked great too. The only feature I wish it had is the leterbox eliminator that the Samsung had, it allowed you to zoom and and crop the left and right of the 2.35:1 image to fit a 16:9 screen. You can however zoom to 1.5X with the Oppo and accomplish this but some aliasing occurs so I think I will just stick with the OAR for now. All in all I am very pleased, the player looks good, and works good."
5,The best player,"Oppo is one of the best player I've seem.It's the best in all:picture,color,use and price. I've a Philips Q50,a JVC XV-D723,but Oppo is so far the best.It's a multi region player,that you change by the remote.It is a fantastic dvd player and the customer service is excellent.I recommend it very well."
3,"It Doesn't Amaze, But It Doesn't Suck Either","The Maze is a strange one. The first hour is a generic killer chases and kills attractive young people kind of film. But the last thirty minutes or so is like a crime drama with police questioning a would-be victim about the events that took place that night. So it get points for doing something different, and sort of changing genres in the third act. However, the film as a whole is just average. The killer isn't exactly menacing. He is skinny and pale and wears a hood, instead of a creepy mask. The Maze is only worth watching if you've seen the majority of the slasher movies out there, and want to see something new."
2,Slasher without gore,"The Maze is a Slasher about 5 friends who are playing hike and seek in a Corn Maze . The game turns ofcause deadly BUT whitout any gore at all . If this movie was made in the 70s it would be good , but nowadays no . 2 stars ."
3,Works fine. Uses AA batteries.,"The main thing I liked about this grip is that it uses AA batteries. I haven't done a real test but my Duracell DX1500 NiMH 1.2V rechargeable batteries seem to work fine. But like I said, I haven't used it out on the field yet so they may be a total failure. I like how cheap and available AA batteries are but if you aren't shooting film enough to constitute the $30 price tag (what I got it off Amazon for), then it may be a better choice to stick w/ the CR2 lithiums.I wanted to give this a 3.5 star rating and round up to a 4 but decided to keep it at 3 because it doesn't have the exposure buttons/wheel on it which is kind of annoying. I mean, that's the whole point of a grip is to be able to shoot portrait more comfortably. So you have to set the exposure where you want it and then just be happy that you have a button there. God forbid you accidentally leave it on and bump it on something...oh no, wasted frame!"
5,Wonderful and helpful addition!,"I had been wanting one of these for my Rebel T2 for a long time, and scoured the internet for one. The batteries that the T2 normally takes can be expensive and hard to find, so the ability to power it with easy to find AA's made this worth it alone. And having the extra shutter control is the icing on the cake, since I take a lot of vertical shots.A word of warning though, if you get one and install it on a camera that has the ""date"" feature, make sure your date settings are what you intend them to be. I almost always keep it turned off on mine, and found out it was turned on after I got a roll of film back."
5,"Very early Laibach stuff, handsomely packaged","This CD contains four songs (not three as indicated below). The fourth song is listed on the cover as Die Grosste Kraft and inside as Nova Delo. The recordings date from 1984/85, the period of the original Occupied Europe Tour when Laibach's influence on Europe was at its peak.Die Liebe is a highly sensual song and infused with Laibach's trademark ""nationalism."" (I put that in quotes, because it was the slander against them spread by the Serbian nationalists who controlled the dieing Yugoslav regime of the mid-80s.) The lyrics are included in English for three of the songs, including Die Liebe. Die Grosste Kraft is a re-mix of Die Liebe, revelling in a lyricism of voice, synth and horns. Quite moving, really.Great cover and booklet art throughout, including an important quote from Tito behind which Laibach concealed (or revealed, as you wish) their culturally subversive and revolutionary intent. This is maybe my favorite Laibach CD."
3,Disappointed. Not real bright at all.,"After reading the reviews on this brand, but the 60"" version, and now this one here, I decided to go with this one. I have a Full Size Chevy, but I wanted this to go across the top of my headache rack, since it blocks the 3rd brake light, so I needed this shorter one.I'm glad I tested it out before installing it. It's not very bright in the daylight at all. In fact, 30 feet back, it's very dim. I tried it hooked to the factory trailer plug, as well as direct battery connect just to be sure it wasn't a faulty connection, same result.I haven't decided yet if I'm going to send it back and look elsewhere, or give it a shot, but I'm leaning toward sending it back.It's ok for a novelty I guess, but not near as bright as they depict in the images, nor for any sort of serious additional brake light warning power.On another note, it was at least packed very well!"
1,Deadly,"A very good friend of mine just had to put his police K9 partner down after she ate some of this plant. The vets tried valiently to save her for 3 days, but unfortunately this beautiful dog did not make it. PLEASE be careful before you purchase this plant - it is beautiful, but deadly."
1,Extremely poisonous,"Please research before purchasing these Sago ""Palms"". I did not know until reading the other review here and do have small children in the home. Even a scrape with the fronds can cause a reaction. There is not a part of this plant that is non-toxic. What is even more scary is that even with prompt and agressve medical treatment these can be fatal in about 3/4 of cases with pets. Children weigh about the same or even less so I would hate to think of what would happen should my kids become exposed! And despite the name they aren't even palms, they are cycads.Mine has been in the home for less than a year and after reading further on the internet from reputable sources it is going straight into a bag then into the trash. It is one of the most toxic plants out there. Not worth chancing my child's health (may cause permanent liver damage) over a plant!"
2,Flawed second novel,"Set during the English Civil War, this novel lacks the craftsmanship of both Sabatini's first novel and of his mature works. The setup (treachery, revenge, and an unsurprising surprise revelation) has the potential for classic Sabatini treatment, but from that point on the plot collapses. The main dramatic interest from that point on is how Sabatini will get himself out of the corner he's painted himself into. Minor spoiler warning: He doesn't. The ending, driven by coincidence (as is not uncommon in Sabatini) fails to satisfy the reader, and is completely unsatisfactory by Sabatini's later standards."
3,Well written,"The Tavern Knight is a classic adventure story well written from the first to the last page. Rafael Sabatini has written better books but I can find no fault with this one.If you're already familiar with Sabatini - just read it. If you are not, I'd recommend reading one of his more popular books such as 'Scaramouche' first."
1,Classic Author / unreadable edition,"This edition of Sabatini's novel is a poorly typed manuscript-- 8 1/2 x 11, typewriter font -- with a cover slapped on. It is an affront to anyone who values the work of Sabatini, or any other author. I attempted to struggle through it, but in the end returned it to order an edition by a publisher with some regard for readers and writers."
4,A Lucky Discovery,"I really enjoyed this film despite the fact that it was French. (OK, it may be Swiss-French but I was unable find any info on IMDB.) I have a snarky nickname for French films: Plotless Wonders. That's because when on the rare occasion French filmmakers deign to include something as pedestrian as a plot it's buried under layers and layers of allegory, symbolism and metaphor. Not my cup of tea and because of this, I avoid French films as a rule. But this movie is a refreshing exception. And it actually has a plot although some coincidences are a bit too far-fetched to accept. It's the funny and well-acted story of a literature professor who is appointed the guardian of a sixteen-year-old orphan. The more he protests the appointment, the deeper in trouble he gets. Some of the characters have sudden and unexplained personality changes but I was able to overlook this because most the characters are so likable and the story so much fun. Well worth a rent!"
3,Only so so,"This swiss film is sort of disappointment. I love european cinema, but this one won't belong to my favorites.First and foremost - the plot. Professor J-P is a man who loves to complicate things. But apparently the writers forgot that sometimes too many complications is not good. It made me feel irritated observing how the action developed. Moreover the whole ""let's make it as difficult as possible"" thing didn't make it more funny :(In case of other characters the thing is quite the same. Neither his ""wife on paper"", nor his lover were appealing. Sure, there are some amusing scenes, but one can expect much more from comedy like this.Acting is acceptable, more or less.If you plan to buy it, try to rent it first."
5,The Best!!,My Havanese loves this much more than the beef!! She hasn't turned it down at all! Makes her eyes look so GOOD!
5,Great product!,"When I first got my pup I tried wipes and liquid cleaners and kept her face shaved but her eye stains only got worse. So i finally decided to invest in a bottle of Angel Eyes and I am glad I did. I love this product. I saw results within 3 days of use and my peach-colored poodle really likes the flavor. Her nasty brown leaky eyes have cleared up completely despite the fact that i really only remember to give it to her every other day. I highly recommend Angel Eyes, it's worth the money."
3,could be better,"this stuff works great, but its crazy expensive considering the bottle is only half way filled. id probably buy it again cause its the only thing that truly works, but its upsetting."
2,Don't wast your money,"This product did not work. It's expensive. I contains antibiotic. I'm still looking for something that works, but I've concluded that Tylosin antibiotic is NOT the answer."
4,This stuff works!,"I use this for my white Havanese dog. This product keeps his eyes from getting very ""gunked up"" and having that build up around his yes. I am usually skeptical about these types of products but it really works. Only issue I have with this bottle is he doesn't seem to like the beef flavor. I have used other flavors in the past and he seemed to like those better but he is not so keen on this flavor."
5,This stuff works great.,I am so impressed with this product. My dog is so cute now that he doesn't have brown goo coming out of his eyes.
5,Angel Eyes Stops Eye Stains,My cavapoo had red eye stains. This product eliminated them within two weeks. I now use it once a week to maintain. No more stains!
2,Charley's Eyes,"We bought this product and found it did not agree with Charley. He became listless and it aooeared it did not agree with him. We took him off of the Angel Tears within 4 days. AFTER A WEEK he became his old self. My question is what do we do with the unused portion, do we get a refund?"
4,"Works, but try chicken flavor instead!!","Seems to work if used every day, but our maltese hates the flavor. Try feeding it with a tablespoon of wet food to hide the flavor."
5,My chihuahua has had weepy eyes,I didn't think this would help my dog's weepy eyes. I decided to try it on a whim. My dog didn't like it at first as I tried it on his food. I then would place it in his mouth with a spoon. After awhile he decided he liked it and licks it up from my measuring spoon. His face is clear of black/brown tears. He has clear fur around his eyes. This works and it works well. My chihuahua now has a clean face clear of dark stains. I am not sure how it works but I would recommend it to all who has this problem with weepy eyed dogs.
4,A different Method to administer,"I have used this product for over a year. It works fine. In the beginning she would take it on her food. But then she would not eat her food with Angels Eyes on it. She is fussy. So after I threw out some food I discovered that if I take the powder in a small dish and mix it with a few DROPS of water, roll it up into a ball she takes like a treat every time. If you have problems feeding it to your pet try this. Do not use very much water just a drop or two. Works great."
4,Angel's Eyes,Angel's Eyes Tear Stain Remover is simple to use. Just sprinkle a little on the dog's food. In a couple weeks he stains will begin clearing up. Dogs do not notice this addition to their food.
4,Very Good product and fast easy shipping,Angels' Eyes is a very good product. It has eliminated tear stains from my dogs eyes and they don't notice it sprinkled in their food. Shipping was very fast and easy.
5,pleased with this prduct.,"My daughter has a dog that has a lot of eye secretions, and she is thoroughly pleased with the product- she bought it elsewhere the last time, and I ordered it for her this time."
5,great stuff,My dog has only been on it for 1 month but his tear stain pruduction has slowed way down already.
5,Effective with reduced dose,"I tried Angels Eyes at the recommended dose for three days, and it worked quickly. Then my 20 pound Bichon threw up. It may have been the mulch she ate, but I discontinued the Angels Eyes for three weeks. Then I started back at a much reduced dosage. I call it a pinch a day with her breakfast. It took a little longer, but that ugly red that covered her mouth and drained from her eyes is gone! My vet was very impressed with the results, as was I. So far, so good!"
5,Brown eyes away,The product worked great for my bichon frise. The brown went away a few days after I started using it.
1,Angels Eyes Tear Stain,"When I put this on my dog's food, he wouldn't eat it; consequently, I don't use it."
4,"It works SO well, BUT........","I have a 4 year old American Eskimo, and this product has worked WONDERS on her eye secretions. As an added bonus, she absolutely LOVES the taste and gets so excited when it's dinner time!My concern has to do with what I am seeing with her fur clumping and falling out. It happens right around her hip area, on both sides, I can sit with her and gently pull out at least 4 handfuls of white fur.I was hoping this would dissipate when I went down to feeding every other day, as per the instructions.....but I really am not even sure if it's due to Angel Eyes.Although, I have never seen her shed like this - even in summer the last 3 years when we weren't using Angel Eyes.Anyone have similar experiences that could help me determine if this is hurting her?thanks."
2,"May work, but not for all tastes","I can't really testify as to whether this product works or not, but judging by others reactions it appears to. However, our English Bulldog, who is generally not picky at all, will not eat the stuff. We've tried multiple ways of giving it to him, but each time he refuses to eat.Eventually we have gotten him to eat it, however I've noticed that he has gotten sick several times subsequent to eating the product. Again while it may work, beware that it does not agree with all dogs tastes or digestive systems. Needless to say we are disappointed."
4,The End of Goopy Eyes,"My dog groomer recommend this product after I had asked her to recommend some medicated eye wipes for my Shih Tzu/ Maltese puppy. She said the wipes didn't really do much, but Angel Eyes worked from the inside out. I've been using it for a little over a month, my puppy's eyes are goop-free and there are no telling tear stains on her face. It comes in a number of flavors--I chose Beef. You simply sprinkle a bit into their food each day. I saw results the first week."
5,Amazing,"It took a while for us to see the difference, but we noticed IMMEDIATELY when we stopped using this product. It really stopped the staining on our Shih Tzu. It was recommended to me by a Maltese owner and again by a friend who shows dogs. I have yet to find anything that is easier (just sprinkle on their food!) and works better!!!"
3,Tear Stain Remover,Just started the product so not sure how it is going to work but so far so good....
5,"Tear stains, what tear stains?","I purchased this product for my 4 month old Bolognese pup who was having a terrible tearing problem which seemed to be worse in one eye. I could tell they were bothering him as he was always pawing at his eyes even after my cleaning them w/ a warm wash cloth daily. I popped for the large 120 gram bottle of Angle Eyes and started him off with 1/4 tsp daily. He wouldn't eat it when I sprinkled it over dry food so I bought some wet and started mixing everything together. Once I made this switch he ate it all and even licked the bowl. Now the product does take some time to work but within a month I noticed a marked difference. He's been on it about 6 weeks now and the pawing at the eyes has stopped, I only need to clean his eyes ever 3-4 days, and the discoloration is improving. After reading several other reviews I know I need to give this product more time to work fully but I must say, I'm sold."
2,Angel Eyes,"I think if you look closely, Angel Eyes is just Tylan 40, which you can buy here on Amazon for much less. Tylan is a drug used widely in swine and poultry industries. It has been around a long time and is very safe."
1,dont buy this,"This product contains an antibiotic called Tysolin which weakens a dogs immune system and causes stomach upset in most dogs. Dont let the results fool you. There is a much better product made with all natural ingredients called Naturally Tearfree Canine , which can be bought on amazon."
5,Awesome product,"This works amazingly. Prescription meds, eye ointments and even shampoos didn't clear the tear stains, but this product makes the most wonderful difference. Would highly recommend it to anyone whose dog has tear stains. It also alleviates chronic ""dog breath"" in our older dogs which is a benefit we didn't expect. The brochure suggested it would do this, but we didn't expect it. Boy, were we surprised when we found it really does all the things it claims to. 5 stars and many more."
1,Contains a supposed harmful ingredient,"After researching this product online, I cancelled my order. It seems this product contains an antibiotic or something and some people's dogs were getting sick. I have found that eliminating grains from her diet solved the problem. I give her a dog food called Evo, grain free, small bites, for my six-pound Yorkiepoo. She loves that food and no more eye staining. I would never give her anything harmful and I was afraid that this COSTLY product contains a harfmful ingredient."
1,angel's eyes tear-stain eliminator for dogs,This item doesn't appear to work- we still have to clean the eyes every day.
1,Stupid and likely illegal,Using an antibiotic drug for cosmetic purposes on your pet is a very bad idea. It will increase the likelihood that you and your pet will get a resistant infection. Think MRSA.It is also likely illegal because this drug has not been approved for this purpose by the FDA. The only legal use for tylosin in dogs and cats is by injection for treatment of respiratory illness. For that you need to go to a veterinarian.
1,Toxic to dogs with long term use,"Hi,This product contains the antibiotic, Tylosin which is not approved by the FDA for use in dogs. This antibiotic can be liver toxic with long term use and can compromise your dog's health in other ways as well: killing of the good flora in your dog's GI tract sets the stage for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth of the wrong species of bacteria; makes your dog susseptable to yeast growth, etc. This product is banned in other countries which should make you very nervous about continuing to use it."
2,I was elated in the beginning!,"Angel's Eyes has great results, but I started noticing that my poodle's fur and skin were drying out. Also, the groomer had pointed this out, plus the groomer noticed that the poodle was developing a couple of sores on her paws. There is an ingredient in Angel's Eyes that is a natural antibiotic. The more research I did on this ingredient, I realized that it was not good for my poodle. It can cause fungus in the body.I will not use it anymore, since there are side effects.Margot"
1,angel eyes,"Being that the product is a powder, if your dog does not like the taste of the powder, it can't work because they won't eat it. That is what has happened with my dog, she liked it at first, but now won't touch the food with it on it. A pill form would of been better"
5,"NIce, new flavor",I've been using Angels' Eyes on my Maltese for nearly his whole life and am satisfied with the product. I decided to try this new flavor when I saw it was available as I didn't really like the smell of the original one when I was putting it in his food (and couldn't fathom that the chicken would be any better!). There is no odor at all to this one and it is working just as well to keep the staining from his eyes. It's Angels' Eyes sweet potato flavor from now on in this house!
1,It made my dog sick!!!,My Dog wouldn't even try it. I mixed it with food and when he got hungry he ate it and vomited it all up. Be careful giving it to your dog!!!
5,It works,"It works quickly and this is a great price. Results on my Shih-Tzu in days. I don't use the full dose, but did for about a week. Now I give her what amounts to a little more than 1/3 the recommended amount and I am happy with the looks of the new hair growth. She doesn't mind the taste--to me it smells like a mild dog food."
3,Seems to be working,My partner and I have a 3 year old Lhasa Apso and she gets tear stains everyday on her little face. We actually started wiping it off every morning but it can be so tedious and since we live such a hectic lifestyle it's hard to keep up. It seems to be working but we'll see... I'm a little anxious if this has any side effects. It seems to be all positive from what I've read online.
5,WONDERFUL,We were having a terrible time with stains on our puppy's eyes. We would give her a bath but the next day the stains were back. We used this product about 2 weeks and the results were wonderful. She is nine months old now and she looks beautiful. I hate to think what her eyes would look like if my Vet had not told me about this product.
4,Angel Eyes,I purchased Angle Eyes for my Bichon and it is working beautifully. The tearing is improving daily. Thanks Barbara
4,It works!,"I can see a noticeable difference in the brown stains under my white toy poodle puppy's eyes. Before using Angel Eyes she looked like a goth. After using Angel Eyes for 2 months she has a little bit of brown stain under the eyes, which is only visible close up. At a distance you can't even see the stains."
1,Messy and didn't work,"Unless you feed your dog canned food, this product is a pain to administer. I put the powder on my dog's dry food, and after 3 days his white beard had turned completely brown from the powder, and it did not wash out easily. After that I folded it in some cheese, but it's a ton of powder and this was messy, plus I don't like giving my little dog that much cheese. Why can't it just be a pill?I went on for 3 weeks and saw zero improvement, so I switched to a whitening eye wipe that seems to work better."
4,Angel Eyes,"Everyone states that you need three weeks to see an improvement. I started seeing the change within the week. Lately tho, my dog has bypassed the dog food and gone for the cat food. I am not sure if it the powder on the food."
1,Bad taste,"I got this for a Maltese and add it to his food as the product suggests. My dog stopped eating for two days, he could not come near his food once this medicine is added to his food. It looks like not all dogs will accept to eat it!!! So i got nothing out of it."
5,Amazing,"I wouldn't have believed that dog's tear stains can actually be eliminated! Working as a groomer, one of my customer's tried this and I witnessed the transformation of brown stains to virtually none! Bought some for myself and have given to other clients to try!! Simply AMAZING!!"
4,Angel Eyes,"Our Westy, Susi, gets drops for dry eyes daily. She developed black streaks under her eyes from the tearing with the drops. Angel Eyes has reduced the streaks to near zero, but a little bit remains.Norm Hershfield"
1,PRODUCT DOES NOT PASS QUARANTINE FOR AUSTRALIA,Looking forward to trying out this on my dog but it was confiscated and destroyed by Australian Customs as it contains dried beef and does not pass our quarantine restrictions so if you live o/s check before ordering!
2,Angel eyes for dogs,"It was a bit pricey for us but we were willing to try it to see if it would help with the discoloration and tearing of our precious Shih Tzu. We began to use the product on him and he dog became very listless and had extremely loose bowel movements. I checked the ingredients list and found it had 100% beef liver. Our dog is allergic to many things, particularly beef. So, I gave the rest of the product to a friend to use for their dog. Allergies to beef are common and I wish I would have checked the ingredients before I purchased the product."
3,"It works, but....","I've been using the product on my lhasa apso male since March so roughly 8-9 months.The red staining did go away at an expensive cost. It would run approximately $60 each month to use the product daily to not develop anymore red stains.While the red stains were not growing in, a strange odor was coming on. I can't begin to describe what the smell is. It's not a normal B.O. smell, but it's quite horrific. It's so bad my friends shoo my dog away and mock him for the smell.The area around the eyes is still wet and leaves the fur almost glued like hairspray, but yet it's not red, hooray?I still use the product since I didn't like the red, but I'm thinking I may stop after awhile and just deal with the red stains. They do come back. I discontinued the Angel Eyes for a month and red was coming right back."
1,Doesn't work,"It's ground up liver. After six weeks the color changed, but no better. I heard about and tried Distilled Water. It works, but my dog won't drink it. Try that, it only cost a buck a gallon."
4,Works great,I bought this because a friend used it for her Maltese. She swears by it. I found it to work great. The only problem was getting my Shih-Tzu to eat his food with it on it. He didn't care for the flavor at first.
5,Our dog skipper looks great!,The Angel Eyes product has really helped clear up any browning under the eyes and hair around the mouth. I will keeping on getting the product for our doggy.
3,Angel Eyes review,I have only used Angel Eyes for about 1 week or so and there seems to be a slight improvement in Caseyl's teardrop color. But I am not totally convinced about its ability to eliminate the stains. I think it will take some more time.
1,Not good for larger dogs,"My Boston has stains on his eye. For his weight, I could only give him about two weeks worth of meds in the small container, so there wasn't even enough in there to see any results."
3,Use With Caution,"I only bought one bottle and will not be buying more. This may be a great product, but I was unaware that it is 100% beef liver. They don't tell you that in the ads. There is no ""magic"" to this product. I already feed my dogs dried beef liver daily to prevent cataracts. If I add this to their diet, I could overdose them on Vitamin A or Iron. I can't take the chance. I understand there is another product that has a touch of antibiotic in it. I will purchase that and will then decrease their daily dose of beef liver and give them the one with the antibiotics. That makes more sense to me. If you know more about this, I would welcome any input."
3,Good For Bentley's Eyes,It hasn't been long enough to see the full effect this has on our 8 month old Shih Tzu puppy but we can see a slight improvement in the 4 weeks that he has been given this powder on his food daily.
1,can cause diarrea,"Be aware that the anti biotic in this stuff kills the good bacteria in the dogs system.. While most dogs seem to tolerate it others do not. Ours started having black runny stool after only a few days. It will take away the tear stain!! I have to admit. We have tried several products, the best being Tear Stain Supplement from Petsmart. At only $9.00 its a bargin, and only a third the cost of angel eyes."
2,Not very impressed with this item.,First bottle did nothing for my dog. I called the company and received another type(chicken) one week and a half. We will see how this one goes.
5,angel eyes,The product arrived lighting fast and it just the way I thought it would be!Thank you so much for the prompt service!
5,It seems to be working!,We have a bichon puppy who is almost 4 months old. I started using this product about 4 weeks ago and it has really helped with the tear stains. He doesn't have crust from his eyes anymore. I think the more his fur grows out he will look even better. I give it to him at his last feeding of the day and I put a few spoonfuls of canned puppy food with his dry puppy food and mix 1/8 tsp. of the product and he eats it up. When I put it on just the dry food he won't eat it.
5,Great product!,"I recently got a shihtzu-maltese puppy. At first, I noticed she did not have the tear stain problems that her siblings did. A few weeks later I started to see brown stains below her eyes and it kept getting worse. After searching online I found Angel Eyes. I asked her groomer about it and she said she did not have 1st hand experience with it but a few of her customers swore by it. I'm on my 2nd bottle and it completely took it away. My puppy's face is clean again and as cute as when I got her. I am thrilled that this product works so well and very quickly, too!"
5,Give it Time!,"I've been giving this to my puppy for a little under 2 months now. Bottom line -- I re-ordered. I really, REALLY noticed a difference about 3 weeks ago -- probably at the 3-4 week mark. Tear stains are basically non-existent! This stuff is great, and what's even better is that my vet was amazed. He'd never heard of Angels' Eyes, so I brought in the bottle. He only shook his head and said ""keep giving it to him! That's fantastic!""Yes, the dogs have to ingest it, but you can put it in anything! Peanut butter, soft food, etc. to make sure they get their dosage.Absolutely try it!!!"
5,Angel Eyes tear stain remover for dogs,"I bought a white maltese puppy, with terrible tear stains around her face, especially her eyes and mouth. None of the products in a pet store (I tried about 5) worked. I met a lady walking a similar dog, with no stains and she said her dog used to look like mine, until a few months after using Angel Eyes. The new fur grew out perfectly white, not brown. I have been using it for a couple of months now, and it does seem to be working, so I am pleased."
5,Unbelievable product!,"I have an all white dog and her eye staining was terrible. I had heard about Angels Eyes but have to admit, I was very skeptical. I am now a true believer of this product!! As I used the product, I trimmed away the fur that was already stained and unbelievably as the new fur came in, it wasn't stained! I am now on my 3rd bottle and will keep using Angels Eyes. Believe me - it works!"
5,It's the best,"I have been using this for over a year and it is truly a fabulous product. I have recommended it to so many people at puppy park, as they all ask how I keep him so ""white"". The price on this site can't be beat. I will use this as long as it is available."
2,Disappointment so far..,"My maltese puppy is 4.5 month old now (4.5 lbs) and he's been taking this twice a day for about month and a half now. I don't really see any improvements yet. At first, I followed the recommended dose (1/4 tablespoon daily) as written on the bottle, but my puppy threw up for two days straight. Since then, i've been giving him about 1/8 tablespoon daily.. i'm going to try for another month to see what happens.."
4,Really works!,"I have bought several brands of ""tear stain removal"" for my Maltese puppy. Every one of the purchases turned the staining an orange color......disgusting! But when I tried Angel Eyes, it took about a week but there is no more staining. The only reason I am giving the product 3 instead of 4 stars, is that there still is some staining in his little mustache. it is minimal and there is literally nothing around his eyes. It works the best of any other product I have used."
5,It Really Works,Our dog had really dark brown tear stains on his face. After using the product for a month I can tell the stains are getting lighter and I expect next time we have him groomed the stains will be gone.This does not happen overnight so I would suggest getting the biggest size bottle offered.I would have never thought this would have worked but I have been proved wrong.
5,angel eyes,My sister told me about angel eyes and how good it was. I am amazed at how wonderfully this product works. I have a new bichon pup and I can't stand the tear stains that this breed has. After a month of using the angel eyes it is almost completely gone. I expect with continued use tear staining is not going to be a huge issue. There is nothing that looks so bad as stains on a snow white pup. I am thrilled I found this product and highly reccommend it.
5,angel eyes,"The product was terrific and the service from amazon is great. I would recomendto anyone that buys online. Thanks for the great service. Tony/ DuBois, Pa."
2,Can't get the dogs to take it..,"I can not get my two poodles to eat the food that this is put on...they will eat around it, push it off and just walk away...so I guess I can't say it work or not..."
5,angel eyes,"I was hesitant to use, so asked my vet who said it does have antibiotic in it but less than they give chickens and would not hurt my dog. I saw an immediate change, since my dog is white, even though I gave him half the recommended dose. Did not upset his stomach and he loves the taste."
5,amazing!!!,Great stuff- completely cured the staining on my Bichon. Initially used a few times a week as instructed. Only need to use once a week now to maintain benefit. It really works!!
4,takes a while to work,I was told by a pet store employee that this was the best product above all others. I have been using it for 2 weeks and maybe I need to up the dosage as my dog still has SOME eye stains. It has removed most but I would like all to disappear. I do recommend this product.
2,Angels' Eyes,"My dog refused to eat his food with Angels' Eyes on it. Now, that he's old enough to be groomed regularly, we won't need it. I wasted my money buying it."
1,fake product,Purchesed angel eyes in feb 2011 I should have known that something was wrong because the price was a fraction of what it normally cost. The product was used over half of the bottle it was the powder form however it smelled like fish food and wasn't the normal texture so I didn't give to my dog.I will go to pets mart and pay full price for a sealed bottle however we are military and one hour from the nearest petsmart so maybe my issue is with the seller and not the actual company angel eyes is a good product so this was definately the seller
1,"contains an undisclosed amount of tylosin, an antibiotic.","It seems ashame to dose pets with an unknown amount of an antibiotic. This helps develope antibiotic resistant organisms. I don't know if it works or not. My vet's advice was "" accept it as part of your pet. I f you are not going to show, just get used to it. keep her eyes clean and the hair around the eyes short to cut down on fungus and skin irritation cause by constant damp hair.Yes, I think it detracts from their beautiful face, and I color my own hair, but at least it is my choice."
1,no real difference,"I have been using the product faithfully with my dog and it has improved very little. I am not sure that I would spend the money again on this product. I have been told by a breeder to use mink oil and proxcide on the fur. I will try this before spending the money again on this product. I was very dissappointed, I will continue to see if it improves. If it does start to work I will write another review.Sadly disappointed"
2,No taste for Angel Eyes,"My dog doesn't like the taste of Angel Eyes in his food (I mix it in). He will eat it about 50% of the time if I don't use a full dose and if he is really hungry. I would really like to use this product beacause he has really bad tear staining. I believe it works, but I don't know how to get him to acquire a taste for it."
5,miracle!,I dont write reviews but I had to write for this one - its so good! my bichon had tear stains and now they r gone. u can mix in food or give like a powder-treat (at least she thinks its a treat) and she will lick right off. She loves it. With time I dont even need to give it that frequently. now i give her once a mnth or so-the stains dont come back.
1,Use caution with this product,"While the product does work, be aware that Tylosin is actually a low grade antibiotic. After 2 weeks of use, both my Bichons developed diarhea - and that is when I discovered what Tylosin really is. Use of a daily antibiotic can kill the ""good"" intestinal bacteria and cause other problems. If you are planning on using this product, consult your veternarian first and use with caution!"
4,Angel's Eyes,I've been using this product for about 3 weeks now. I do see a difference in the amount of discoloration of Cali's eyes. She seems to smell a lot better as well!
5,"great product, only one that works","Hi. I have a 3 pound pure white Maltese, and I didn't think anything would help him. I tried the wipes, and so many other products. I thought about getting this one for a while because of the price. But I figured I'd give it a shot. Within a few days I noticed his eyes weren't as runny. It is perfect as long as you use it everyday (or as directed). Plus I don't have to keep wiping his eyes, I just add this to his food and that's all. I highly recommend this to anyone who's dogs have runny eyes, stained eyes or face. Thanks, I'm glad my money actually went for a good product."
5,Finally a eye stain remover that works and the dogs like it!,I have Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and a couple of them get tear stains badly so I tried this. Two weeks before a dog show we started and by the show they were noticeably faded the almost gone! Even helped with stains around the mouth. My puppy likes this add to his food seems to eat up quickly the meals it is added to.
5,CLEAN EYES,"I HAVE A MALTESE PUPPY, AND AFTER USING ANGEL EYES FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS THERE IS A GREAT IDIFFERENCE IN HIS EYES, REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO LET THE STAINED FUR GROW OUT OR GET IT CUT OFF TO SEE THE RESULTS. THE NEW FUR IS CLEAN AND WHITE!! I AM GOING TO TRY IT ON MY CHIHUAHUA NEXT!"
5,Amazing Amazing Amazing,"I researched all over to find what could get rid of the red staining on my wonderful little Maltese/Shih tzu pup's white face. The vet and groomer all said ""nothing can be done, it's just the breed."" I tried only natural color food, filtered water, certain types of bowls, wiping the eyes constantly ... everything I could. I was told Angel's Eyes would not work, but decided nothing else did, what did I have to lose? We tried it and it worked! My little angel pup now has Angel Eyes. I'm so upset I waited so long to try it! I'm definitely a big fan and would suggest you give it a try! My only problem was he only ate hard dog food, and it didn't ""stick"" to that. So now he has a very small ""treat"" of wet dog food each night mixed with Angel's Eyes. He does tricks for that treat every night, and we are rewarded with entertainment and his dear, white face."
5,wow!!!! brilliant!,Dramatic improvement within a week of using this for my Bischon Timmy. He is now 5 years old and the tear stains have got darker as he has got older but now...... wow! totally clear and bright! He looks fabulous.I strongly recommend this product!
2,ACV Works much better and a fraction of the cost!,"I used an entire bottle of Angel Eyes for my shih-tzu, who had smelly runny eyes for about the last 2 years. I thought the price was ridiculous once I saw the bottles, and the end results were fair, but did not totally eliminate the problem. I started researching more and found out thatApple Cider Vinegar (Organic) 32 fl.ozis a natural remedy for this problem. Well, I've used it successfully for my own allergies and many other ailments, so I decided to try it. After a week of a tablespoon in his water, twice a day, the smelly, runny eyes were clear! And I noticed that his general allergies and itchiness seemed to clear up! I had no idea that something I had used for years would work for my dog! But we're both grateful that I found out! :)"
1,Didn't work,Tried this flavor verses the original. I have 2 malteses mixs. The origninal works but they don't like the taste. they like the taste of this but it dosen't work on them.
4,Puppy looking nicer!!!,I have been using Angel Eyes now for 2 - 3 months and have enjoyed a significant improvement in my puppies' appearance around the eye area. I mix it with peanut butter and she takes it without any difficulty.
5,Angel Eyes is awesome!,"Had problems with one of my Bichon Frises' eyes having red tear stains and the other had stains around the mouth and on his paws that he licked alot. Tried everything to get rid of these stains for years. Finally found information on the internet about what this might be, (red yeast) and what helped to get rid of this. Angel Eyes was the product I tried. After about 2 weeks it seemed to fade so I cut some of the hair that was stained to see if it came back. It didn't and eventually when all the old stained hair was cut off, the dogs were white again with no stains returning. After giving this product as directed and now on the maintance schedule I am thrilled and the dogs are beautiful. I highly recommend this product."
5,Angels Eyes,"I have been using Angels' Eyes for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Maltese for a year and a half.NOTHING works as well as this product. People are amazed at how wonderful my dogs eyes look, considering their breeds, and I just smile and tell them it's the Angels' Eyes!"
3,Could go either way,"Although I've only been using this product on my dog for a little over a month, it does appear to help. However, my dog is picky and doesn't really care for the taste and smell of the product. I've had to come up with a couple of different ways to disguise the product in the food. So I guess it really depends on the animal and whether or not your willing to spend a little more time making sure that your dog will eat it."
4,Stop the tearing,I have been using Angel Eyes for about 3-4 weeks and it has improved the tearing our dog has. It did not completely stop the tearing but is a lot better. We will keep using it.
1,Care about your pet's health ???,This product is dangerous to your pet's liver.Contains Tylosin.If you care about your pet STOP giving this stuff.If you don't just keep harming.
4,it helps,Angels Eyes definately helps to keep the stain off of my Havanese but I still need to clean his eyes daily.
2,Angel eyes for dogs,"I was not that impressed with this product. First, my dog did not like anything I put it on. So it was very hard for him to consume. Second, I think I could have seen if it worked better if it came in a pill form. he wouldn't eat it and therefore there wasn't much change."
4,Nala and Angel Eyes,"My Nala will only eat her food with 1/3 recommended amount of Angel Eyes; however, we have noticed a definite change in the redness around her little eyes. We will take it slow with her and increase the amount but I am very very happy with the results which were noticeable in a week (at 1/3 dosage)."
2,Worth a try...,"I've been using Angel eyes on my Maltese since he was three months old.I used it religiously for six months, but did not notice a significantdifference in his eye discharge or tear staining. Now that he is close to a year old, I am taking him to a canine eye specialist to have histear ducts punctured and irrigated. Hopefully that will work."
2,Update for cats...,"This product says it is suitable for cats. My cat will not touch her food with this on it. The instructions say to put it in water, if they won't eat the food; that doesn't work for her either. Apparently it works best for dogs. I received it quickly, and the packaging was fine, I just cant use it!12/2008: Okay, I got some Friskies ""pate"" style canned cat food and mix up a bit with the food and my cat will eat the product. I've been giving this to her for about two weeks now and her eyes are clearing up nicely. I'm going very light on the dosage, so I'll update again in a few weeks. I would change the rating to a higher one, but it won't let me."
5,Extremely satisfied with product results,"I purchased this product for my Pomeranian/Chihuahua. When I adopted him, I took him to my local Veterinarian as I was concerned with the tearing of his eyes as well as the tear stains. I was given eye ointment to apply in his eyes, but was also told that the condition may be permanent. A friend referred Angel Eyes to me; at approximately 3 - 4 weeks, I noticed a considerable improvement in his eyes. They were no longer tearing and it didn't seem such a strain for him to focus his sight. What once seemed to be sad eyes are now clear and happy! I have reduced the dosage, but will continue with usage of this product to maintain the appearance of his now healthy eyes."
5,Angels eyes tear stain eliminator,"Excellent product - After a couple of days of use my Bichon's eyes stopped running so no more staining - I could notbelieve this would work. We had been giving ""Mimi"" Acidofolus tablets daily for about a year and her stains were getting worse. Thank you for helping ""Mimi""Gail"
5,It really helps!,"I purchased this for my maltipoo last week and then I put half teaspoon into her meal for today is the third day. I noticed that the reddish brown stain are better! and the smell is not that bad,too. But the price is kinda high. Anyways it helps!"
5,Webster -Amazon,Super product! Easy to use and no mess.My Bichon needed something to combat the leaking eyes.This product cleared things up within nine days. No morerings around they eyes.Webster is handsome again and at a reasonable price.Thanks Amazon!
3,Maybe for some dogs,"I can't say much about whether this product would eliminate stains around my dog's eyes, because I can hardly get her to eat at all if I'm putting this on her food. Or she doesn't drink her water until the ""soot"" of this powder settles to the bottom if I put it in her water.I think the issue may be that she sniffs her food before eating it, and the powder then goes up her nose. She hates that, so then doesn't want to eat the food. I get her to eat some by mixing it in with her treat of cooked chicken livers, but that isn't every day and I can't mix in nearly the amount recommended if I want her to eat even that. Too bad. All I can do is keep wiping her face every day with the cleaner pads, no matter that she hates it. She hates the powder in her food more."
1,Didn't really do anything.,This was a pretty big disappointment. It really didn't do anything to help my dog's eyes and I used the whole thing hoping it would work. Nope!
2,Didn't really work.,"It seemed like its was going to do wonderfully at first. After the first day the spots lightened up a bit so I thought it would clear up my dogs eyes really quickly. Bt after several days I didn't notice anymore improvement. Plus my dog didn't always want to eat the food, as if he didn't like the taste,"
3,Angel Eyes,"My dog has been using it for only a month now and her eyes still have goop in them every morning. I'm hoping this will dissipate soon. If it works, you'll certainly be getting more orders from me."
3,RIP OFF,"I was shocked to see the bottle I ordered was half empty.I have ordered twice and noticed immediately the bottle was way larger than the last time I order and my order was the same amount of content both times. Unfortunately, I did not have a scale to weight the contents but I feel certain I was seriously ripped off. I will NOT reorder from them ever again. The delivery time was very fast."
4,It Works!,"I use much less of the product than the directions stipulate because my dog won't eat his dry food with too much sprinkled on the food, but it definitely works. My parents introduced me to Angel Eyes after I asked how they finally got rid of the tears beneath their dog's eyes. The product claims are right on target. And when I purchased, Amazon had the best price going. It didn't come with the little measuring spoon (which is very handy) but for the price, you can make do."
2,NO SURE,"I've been using this product for about 2 mths now...for a 5 mth old Cavachon. I don't see any real change in her eyes as yet. Perhaps it is a product that you need to use a while before you see results.In any event, I just repurchased a larger size...and will continue using it. Hopefully, results will be forthcoming. If not, I will not reorder."
5,Awesome product!!!,"The girls at my vets office couldn't believe how ""clean"" my white miniture schnauzer looked. It had been about a week since his bath so it took a little while for me to figure out what it was they were talking about, his eyes were almost snow white and his mouth looked great too. This is a wonderful product. Expensive but well worth it if you can afford it."
5,GREAT Stuff!,"I am a born skeptic. I had doubts about this product but I researched it and liked that it works internally. I have been using this product on my white Shih Tzu doggie faithfully for 3 weeks now and I LOVE the results. I saw the white peeking through at the end of week 2, got her groomed at the end of week 3, and I wanted to cry!! She's my beautiful white-eyed baby again!"
5,Excellent results,"It is AMAZING the difference I saw in the tear stains on my Maltese's eyes! Within one week I saw a difference and now after on month, they are clear! Great product - I will continue to buy it. A bottle lasts about 6 weeks."
5,Really works!,"I used this product on my maltese who was heavily tear stained. I had tried every single type of tear stain removers from wipes, gels, eye drops etc to changing her diet,giving her only bottled water but nothing worked. After using Angels eyes for a week I already noticed a marked difference in that the staining was getting less. She now has been on it for about 6 weeks and even though she still tears, it is much less and best of all the stains are GONE!"
3,Angels Eyes,"My white Peke has had eye issues - lots of tearing - since I got him at 2 years old from a Rescue. I have not had white dogs before so this was the 1st I've dealt with it. I tried a liquid to rub on from a BIG Pet Store - NO EFFECT. I also tried another brand of this type of food additive and it did nothing. Angels' Eyes takes a whole bottle, daily dosage, to even begin making an impact that is substantial, but with the 2nd bottle there is change. I don't know if it's because of the better formulation or the fact that I already tried 2 bottles (One Angels Eyes and the other brand) first, but there is HOPE! I even shaved his stained fur from around his eyes to get a better idea of whether it was actually working. It does. Thanks for the product - but the price is unreasonable I think for the ""lifetime"" use required. I would love to see the price reduced... it causes people to either quit or cut back on dosages - less effective."
5,Angels Wiping Tear Stains,This product has worked well. Just like my children I take pride in how our girl looks and this makes her little eyes so bright . We have a Havashu and there is some staining but I could not image her little eyes without this product.
4,Works Great,"Angel Eyes does just what it claims to do. I have two Bichon Frises; Angel Eyes keeps their tear ducts from staining the fur around their eyes. My babies have clean white faces :)Fast delivery, smooth transaction. The only thing that I don't like is the smell: strong liver odor, but completely worth it!"
2,Very Expensive and not a lot of results for my white Boxer,"Although it seemed to work a little I can't afford to give him this for more than 2 weeks. It's very expensive and the bottle is SMALL. His eyes started looking a little better, then I ran out and now they look worse than before. AY YAY YAY.fast shipment... would work better for a little dog."
5,Effective,"I have been using this on our 4 month old maltese. Since beginning to use it, we have noticed a difference in her tear stains and have reordered more. Definitely worth trying."
1,dog wouldn't eat,I'll never know if this would work because my dog (a terrier mix - probably with chihuahua)would not eat it - no matter what I mixed it with!
4,Seems to be working!,"It took a couple of weeks before I noticed a difference on the tear stains of my 6 month old maltese. It does seem to be working. My groomer said that they look much better and that probably by the next time I take her to be groomed,the tear stains will be gone after she trims around her face. I just hope this doesn't have any adverse long term effects on her health. I just put in an order for the 120 gram bottle.It should last a long time."
4,My poodle has issues,"Our miniature poodle is a rescue dog and came to us with wet, drippy eyes and a vaginal discharge. The Angels Eyes proved to be really effective in dealing with the discharge, and her eyes are definitely better when we use this product. We have had her for two years, and have given her this product for about 1 1/2 years now. Her eyes are still wet and stained, but as I said, they are better than when we did't give it to her. She is a fussy eater, and we could not get her to accept it in her food. We ended up creating small raw beef meatballs with the teaspoon of Angels Eyes in it(she weighs 19 pounds- big for this product). That is a treat she loves to have every day. And yes, we must do it every day, even after all this time. So while it isn't the miracle drug for her, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to other pet owners."
5,Product works great,"This product worked within two weeks, on both my toy poodle and shih tzu. I will buy again when I run out."
5,Excellent product!,Angels Eyes absolutely works! I have tried topical remedies for tear staining on my white Havapoo dog....none work. This product is excellent and it works very quickly....it actually prevents the staining. There is absolutely no more ugly reddish brown stains all down her face. It is worth every penny of it's cost. Once your dog is on the maintenance dose it actually costs very little. Also this site has the best price I have found for this product.
5,You GOTTA Try It!,"It really WORKS! This product comes in a powder form that you add to your dog's food. After adding the product, I sprinkle a little water and stir it. It smells bad but my dog eats it with no problem."
5,Great Stuff,"Angel Eyes is totally great. It has cleared up her eyes and keeping them clear. no more stains. Shared with son and is working just as great on there dog. Sister in law will not use and her dog is stained and looks real bad.I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dog subject to eye staining. Well worth the price,however I would recommend buying in the bigger bottles and save. Believe me you willnot be sorry.Joe Duncan"
1,Didn't work,This product didn't work at all. No change and our dog didn't like the taste if it either. So not a good product for us.
4,marked improvement,"I have been using Angel Eyes in my pom/poo's food for about two weeks now and I have seen a big improvement in the clarity of his eyes. Before I used this product, his eyes were always gunky, I had to wash his eyes almost everyday! Since starting Angel Eyes, I have only had to wash his eyes about 2 times. Even my daughter has noticed and mentioned that he looks great.I have decided to buy the two bottles next time and qualify for the free shipping. That way I get 2 bottle for the price of 1!"
5,good stuff,"Angel eyes started working on my dogs eyes after only a week or so. i've been using it for a month now and they are getting better and better. the only bad thing about it is that it is powder and has a bitter taste so my dog won't eat it unless i really mix it with human food. He eats dry food so it won't mix in with that. Other than that, it is a great product so far...."
3,Jury is still out,"We have been using this product for about 4 months on two of our dogs. One is a Cavalier and the other is a Bichon/Cavalier mix. The Cavalier has not problems with this on the food, but the Bichon doesn't like it at all. We have to add water to the food to dissolve the Angel Eyes powder to get her to eat it. Perhaps this is the reason why we have not seen much improvement in the tearing and staining around her eyes. She is all white so the brown around her eyes still shows pretty clearly. The Cavalier never really had any tearing problems, but we have seen a little improvement in him."
4,Used this product for my shih tzu,"I gave this product a 4 star, because when I received and opened the product, it seemed to me that the bottle was halfway empty. Whether it was 120 gram worth of powder, I do not know, but it sure didn't seem like it. There's no way I could've measured it, unfortunately. It worked for my shih tzu (Using for approx 2 1/2 mos) who had extremely bad tear stains on her face and even from when she licked herself. My husband likes her a lot more now since she doesn't look like Oscar the Grouch. I can say that it defintely took away the major brown stains around her eyes, but there is still a slight discoloring on her face. It seems you can't miss a day from using the stuff in order for it to work well. So if you're going to do it ... Buy plenty! But it will work if you keep up with it."
3,it's working!,The product is working on our white Maltese and I recommend it to anyone with a white dog because the red staining is horrible and this product dissolves the stains
5,Best price for this product,"Amazon has the best price for this product, I usually pay $30 for the smaller bottle, but at Amazon for a few dollars more I got the biggest bottle.The product really works, if your dog already has tear stains follow the instructions, if they dont have the tear stains I recommend using it every other day, then down to 2 or 3 days a week. My shih tzu had bad tear stains when I first got the product I followed the instructions and once the tear stains were gone I switched to using it 3 days a week and my dog hasnt had tear stains since."
5,Picture Perfect Pets,"The reddish brown stains from eye fluids can completely change the appearance of a dog, making him/her look dirty and sickly. Angels' Eyes effectively eliminates these stains, leaving your pet looking healthy and well-groomed. It takes awhile, just days, to kick in, so stick with it and you will be amazed. We have used AE with several Bichon Frisees, and currently with a Lhasa Apso. It has made a huge difference in the appearance of these dogs and it is worth every cent."
2,Angel Eyes,"I ordered this product to use with my Coton de Tulear after I ran out of the Angel Eyes that does not have the antibiotic added (yellow label). My dog would not eat it. He took one sniff and walked away. In fact, he did not eat for 2 days because of it. Now, in order to get him to eat his food with this product on it, I have to add something like baby food to it. The results to the eye area is pretty good (not great) but it is not worth it to go through all the trouble of making him eat. It makes we wonder what it is doing TO him that he will not eat it."
2,Unsealed,"After I unscrewed the cap, the seal was loose. This causes concern. I have heard of others having the same problem with this product. Any explanation???"
4,tear stains,"Here is the funny thing about this product. My Bichon is almost 13 now and I have been using this product for about 2 years. The first thing I had noticed was his ""bad breath"" had gone away. Secondary was the eye stains. I asked my vet and he had not idea why that would be. In my opinion, I am getting two benefits in 1 jar!"
2,"Might work, but it's bitter","My dog is not the most eager eater. I got this product because she has tear stains, but she won't eat it. I accidentally got a little of the powder on my finger and tasted it. It's terribly bitter. I can see why she wouldn't eat it. I even tried mixing it in her wet food, but she will only eat it if she's ravenous. She looks at me with pleading eyes as though to say, please feed me something that tastes good. I suspect this product works, but it won't do any good if I can't get it down her. I called the company with a my question and got a recording asking me to leave my name and number and my question. They never returned my call. I'm not impressed."
4,It's working!,"We purchased Angel Eyes because my sister said that it corrected the dark eye stain on her Bishon. I have an apricot-colored Cockapoo and her eyes are constantly running with black/brown ooze. I purchased the small bottle because I was skeptical of the results. I have to admit, her staining has dramatically been reduced - not gone, but much better. I'm now ordering the large bottle. Our vet told us not to waste our $ on this, and told us the only way to get rid of it was Benedryl. Well, 3 months of Benedryl and no change. One week of Angel Eyes, and dramatic improvement. Hope this helps."
1,Dog would not eat food with this in it!,Heard so many positive reviews of using this product to eliminate tear stains that I ordered it right away for our Shitzu/Bischon mix. It may work great -- but we will never know because our dog refused to eat his food with this sprinkled on it. Smells and tastes bitter. Wish this came in a pill you could just give the dog.
2,Doesn't work,All it does is makes my puppies poop softer and mushier. His face still stinks! He still has tears that stain his face. He's a shih-tzu.
1,Stomach Upset,"Everytime I gave this to my pup, she gets a stomach upset. Either she vomits or have a diarrhea. I gave it to her 2 days in a row and stopped, then I tried again after 3-4 weeks and still got the same result. So I had to throw away an almost full bottle. I spent almost $500 in vet bills to get her checked the first time it happened. I just clean her eye boogey out every 2-3 days."
2,Angels Eyes review,"This is generally a good product. I always select new as the type of product I order. This particular batch does not seem as potent as previous purchases. The eye stain is returning. Maybe Amazon could do a better job at assuring the quality of products, particularly animal products."
