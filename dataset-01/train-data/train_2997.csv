4,stokes my imagination!,"Far, far in the future, long after the catastrophic impact of a huge meteor, the cloned children of humanity's last people who had escaped by establishing a safe harbor on the Moon, undertake the enormous task of restoring life to a barren planet.We start in the near future & move into the very far future & along the way he keeps the theme of hope, innovation & adaptability that our species has survived on for the past 2 million years. A Jack Williamson book is always about the triumph of the human species.I like the twist that he's given the debate on cloning. One more questioning voice added to this timely controversy.His writing makes you conjure up scenarios that otherwise might be unspeakable in our current PC world. My imagination is always stoked when I read Jack Williamson.Read this book & consider its implications! Good stuff!"
4,This is why Williamson is a Master,Jack Williamson was one of my favorite writers when I was growing up and their is enough to this novel to remind me of why I have enjoyed his books so much over the years. At the same time it also illustrated what is missing in some of the science fiction that is written today.This book takes place initially in the near future after the earth has been decimated by the impact of an enormous asteroid. Fortunately millionare Calvin DeFort had narrowly completed an outpost on the moon and has robots in place to ensure that the clones of a select few survivors will carry on the human species.What makes these connected series of novellas work is that Jack Williamson never loses sight of what makes us human-both the good and the bad-and the triumphs and the tragedies that go with being human. Combined with a sense of wonder about the universe and evolution this is an very entertaining and captivating tale from a true master of Science Fiction
3,"A quick, easy read (and not too filling!)","Two things prompted me to check out this book: (1) The cool cover -- I'm a sucker for good sci-fi artwork. (2) The jacket notes -- I'm also a sucker for post-apocalyptic sci-fi. Anyway, I must admit that the only thing by Williamson I've read before this book was ""The Moon Children"" back in the early 70s, so I really can't make too many comparisons. But like ""The Moon Children,"" ""Terraforming Earth"" seems somewhat geared to a younger audience. It's easy reading, and most readers could probably finish it in a day or three. I found the story to be a bit tenuous at times, there were some events and circumstances that the author left insufficiently explained, and the ending (involving the transcendence of our physical forms as human beings) has been done better elsewhere. But the book kept my attention, and I'm glad I read it, so THREE STARS. If you know any older teens who enjoy visionary sci-fi, ""Terraforming Earth"" would make a nice gift."
1,30 tricks & tips,"Thumb is to hard. For a large tip, it does not fit on my thumb. Tip is to thick. Look elsewhere for a better thumb tip. I had one years ago and had a lot fun with it. This one is nothing like the old tip I used then. Silk is not a good quality. Did not review the dvd. NO stars for this product but magic trick is a lot of fun."
1,p.o.s.,"I have had two of these phones. One got hit while in my pocket, which cracked the lcd display making the phone totally useless. The second phone, I have to push the battery into the phone to get service. It drops 90 percent of my calls, and takes at least four tries to send a text or picture message. Spend your money somewhere else."
5,Evaluation,It is very helpfull in order to grow up in the knowledge of Jesus Christ our savior and Lord. It shows why we need him and why God is all sufficient to meet the deepest need of our soul and to give sens to our life. Everyone may be concerned and can profit from this lecture.
2,didn't help me,"This just didn't work for me - I think the main reason is there is too much to it. There are several dvd's, but they just didn't really help me. I still feel the same as I did before reviewing these dvd's and trying to follow his advice."
1,Unreliable product and company,"Bought this product as well as a Derale fan, both of which have disappointed. Controller was defective and have waited 2 weeks for replacement. Derale is 6 hrs away, should have had it after 2 days. Overall, I spent too much money for marginal products, subpar tech support and horrible customer service. Out of the over 5K of upgrades I put into my truck and the 20+ parts supplies and manufactures, this is the worst. There are other product on the market, I for one will be going to the tried and true mechanical fan."
2,Dangerous Instruction Flaw!,"So I read the instructions 5 times. It says to connect the fused red wire to the ground side of the fan and another red wire straight from the batter to the hot side of the fan. This is dangerous advice! If the fan shorts it will draw as much power as the red battery wire can take until it melts and might cause a fire. MAKE SURE YOU ADD A SUITABLE SIZE FUSE ON THE RED WIRE TO THE BATTERY (and the fuse should be close to the battery). Most fans are almost 10 amp so go with a 15 amp fuse. Also, that red wire with the fuse on it from the controller should be Black. I really think who ever the engineer was who designed this should be working at McDonalds instead.Otherwise, just like others I too had one of the wires pop out of their connection (black lead from the sensor)."
1,Slow Shipping and Damaged Goods,"I would not recommend this company! It took the product 3weeks to get here and when it did, the product looked used and rusted out. No instructions and no original box. I sent it back immediately. So Good luck if you try to order anything from this company."
1,no directions,"bought this for hub for his ears. they tend to get wax build up. Rather than pay co-pays all of the time at the doctor,i bought this. The product didn't show up at first, i emailed the company and they sent another one. there are no directionson how to use it, hopefully we'll be able to figure it out when we need it"
5,Great Device,"Best price I found for this ear syringe.Solid construction. Function is right on.Would recommend for anyone needing to periodically flush ear canal. Good, controllable pressure."
1,Ear Syringe,Found this to be of poor quality and leaks from the back causing water to ever wear but were you want
3,usability,There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this product but get a bonafide signal switcher if running two devices or you will get ghost signal.
3,"""Rust"" color?","These are Orange, not Rust. I find them very hard to wear with anything. I have yet to wear them."
3,Family Guy Freakin' Party Pack,"Big Family Guy fan here. This product was advertised as ""Used- like new"". It was not: the box that it came in was broken, some items were dirty and clearly used, one pack of cards was opened and used and many packets for the poker chips had been ripped open.The DVDs played fine, which is why I did not return it. On a positive note, the package arrived quickly after the order was placed and the DVDs were in a separate ""CD"" case for easy storage.Use caution with this seller advertising ""Like New"". Product sold by: facethaballa"
4,Good To Catch Up On The Seasons,This product is a great way to get the first five and a half season on DVD. The CD zipper case which holds all the seasons is a good idea but some of the DVD's can get scratched; mine fortunately did not though. The ping pong set and poker set are a cute idea but I don't really play the games. I think this product is a bit overpriced for what you get. If you don't plan on using the Ping pong set or the poker set I would say just buy the DVD's individually.
1,Never got it!,The item never came and the seller never answered any of my emails. Freakin' Disaster.
5,What a deal!,"I used to travel a lot for work. Spending days in various hotels gets old quickly, after a long day Family Guy provided a good laugh at an economical price! Giggity Giggity."
5,Hilarious...,"I bought this DVD set for 90 bucks and it was well worth it. Apart from the DVDs there's playing cards, ping pong paddles, and all sorts of other stuff. And of course, the DVDs are absolutely hilarious. It comes with the Untold Story of Stewie, which was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this DVD set."
3,"Excited at first, then disappointed","I was excited when I managed to grab this item on sale for $60. I bought it for the DVDs not all of the extra stuff. I don't have any of the seasons box sets, so I figured it was a good deal considering it would be over $100 to buy them individually. After getting ready to watch the DVDs I found that the cheap zip-up DVD case managed to mar every one of the discs. I thought that maybe they would still play fine despite the scuffs, but two episodes into the first DVD the playback became terribly glitchy. I tried playing it in different DVD players, only to find the same problem. It may be completely unrelated to the scuffs, but I doubt it. In conclusion, I think if you're going for the DVDs, go ahead and pace yourself and buy the seasons one at a time so that they arrive in a proper case that won't render them unable to play properly."
1,Great concept. Flawed execution.,"Like the title says... ""Great concept. Flawed execution.""The ping-pong paddles, poker chips, etc. all in one box is a hard deal to argue with. Unfortunately, for all of the bells and whistles, one thing is missing: the actual rest of the series.For now, the best bet is ""Family Guy - The Complete Collection (Stewie Head Packaging) - (Amazon.com Exclusive)"", though a truly ultimate uber boxset is still forthcoming.This box is a novelty. Nothing more. And at the current price tag, it's a very expensive novelty. Personally, I'm waiting until it's done correctly before I buy."
5,"Hillarious, wish it had more.","At the time when I purchased this it contained every season. I do however, wish they'd update it to have the new seasons as well or that they left room in the DVD case to add for possible future seasons. Overall no complaints though, it's a cute package and has some fun stuff in it."
5,Wickedly sweet!,"The set is just awesome. Tho their a few a few cons to it. The DVD's work great on a dvd player, but not with a computer dvd drive. They get all fuzzy and the sound is off. The cards are just cute and the paddles are the best! Everyone loved it. Especially me! =)"
4,Family Guy Freakin great deal,Family Guy is a fantastic show and Amazon has the party pack at an unbeatable price. With free shipping and speedy service you can be enjoying the Griffin family in no time.
5,"Totally Cool, but...","This is probabely the best deal out there, anyone who waited this long to have all, but last, seasons should definitely buy this. BUT, is it too much to ask to make the box the size of standard DVDcases? You'd think it isn't, but they didn't make this happen. So when I buy more seasons I can't put them in the box... Just 5mm wider and the cases would fit in perfectly, or am I wrong? There must be a reason they didn't do this, only I can't think of one that makes any sense.Apart from this, it's freakin' awsome!"
3,Bad finish,This swing is beautiful on our porch. I must complain about the finish of the wood. It has become very weathered under our porch! If I knew that it wasnt for outdoors I would have made a different chioce!
4,We tried them All,"Savannah would have nothing to do with pellets, until I tried ZuPreem. An added incentive is, they throw and roll better than all the others and look so pretty all over the floor! She eats half and decorates with the rest. The other pellets,with the hideously high price, were totally ignored.ZuPreem Avian Maintenance Natural for Large Parrots"
4,Parrot Food,"When I bought the product from Amazon the picture shown is what I normally buy, but I didn't notice that the description was actually for Parrots and Conures and not the Large Pellets for my Macaw as shown in the photo - now I have 5 packages of food that are not the type I normally buy and the hassel of returning it just doesn't make it worth it. I like the product, but I'm not so happy about the photo used to promote the product. You should use the correct photo for the product noted in the description."
5,This is the right pellet,"If you can get your bird to eat them, these are probably the best pellets on the market. There are no dyes, no fragrance, and they resemble nuts. I have two birds and one loves these and the other doesn't care for them. They both eat them, though, and I have noticed a nice color difference in their feathers over the seed mix they were used to eating."
1,Bird foood,"Hated it - bird refused to eat it, tried slowly introducing, tried only - to starve her into eating it., tried feeding her from my lips etc., still didn't work - switched over to Fruit blend product - which she loves."
4,Good CD,"This CD is good for the nursery rhymes, but the tunes are a little lacking. Volumes 1 & 2 are much better at playing longer tunes for each rhyme. The tunes on this CD are fun though, even if they are short. I especially like the rhymes on this CD, even if the songs are short. However, there is one song where the lyrics mention ""cut off his head"", and another mentions the little old woman in a shoe who ""whipped her children, and sent them to bed""....which shocked me a little, as we've fostered a fairly policitally correct and padded environment for our children to grow up in. If you can get past that, this CD really is pretty fun, and I'd bet your child would like it too!"
1,Worthless,"This is a collection of black and white drawings most seem to be mosaics others are paintings or stained glass. The reader doesn't get any feeling for shading or texture. This might make a good coloring book for grade schoolers but if you are looking examples to inspire you, get an encyclopedia."
1,Not impressed,Not at all impressed with a carelessly put together book. Money is better spent elsewhere.
2,Great While it lasted,"Worked ok, Not as large of a frequency range for the noise cancelling as some others. After a week I dropped it from about 4 feet and the noise cancelling stopped working on one side. Should have been able to withstand the fall"
4,Works very well.,Some people who reviewed this are unclear on the concept. It is NOT supposed to reduce the sound of people talking around you. It's supposed to reduce low frequency hums. This it does admirably. It nearly completely silenced the din of my kitchen dishwasher. The effect is dramatic. Audio/music quality is quite good.Fred
4,Great Value for the Money,"I purchased these headphones after seeing them on sale at Amazon. The industry standard for noise-cancelling headphones are made by Bose. However, these are a great value if you do not want to spend that kind of money.As with some of the prior reviewers, I would emphasize that this does not block out all noise. It is great for low-frequency, constant noise such as that of airplane engines, buses, and other sources. You will still hear background sound, just at a much reduced level.The ear-pieces are padded and comfortable, but could be a little larger. There is an audible hiss when the noise cancelling is turned on. However, it is more than compensated for by the reduction in noise. The unit operates on 1 AAA battery.Also, just a side note, you do not have to have the headphones plugged into a source for the noise cancelling to work."
4,Step up from airline headphones,"These headphones are much better than the ones that the airlines give you. There have been times with the airline headphones that I could not make out what the actors were saying. These headphones make everything crystal clear. They also come with an adapter so if the airline uses a two prong connection instead of one then you're still okay. They aren't as good as the Bose headphones, but they are more compact and are almost one-tenth the price. The noise cancelling feature is okay, but like most systems like this it works best on the low end and doesn't cover voices. If you want to cover up voices you're better off listening to music than trying to cancel it with the feature on the headphones. A good value - I'd definitely recommend them."
1,Waste of $$$$$!,"Problem with these is simple....The ear pads do not cover your ears completely so ambient noise is let in! Especially on an airplane!!! Even with the volume cranked all the way up, I could not hear the dialogue on my DVD! Worthless! Flimsy too! Different noise cancelling settings a waste! Save your money...Get the Maxell HP-NCII headphones instead..About the same price & do a much better job!"
3,Not good at all,"First of all, there is a hiss when the noise-cancellation feature is turned on in a quiet room.2. It only reduces, and not cancels, external sounds in the lower mid-range. Bass sounds get through.3. The noise reduction seems to work on the music being listened too; when it is on, the bass and the mid-lower range sounds ""mushy,"" and there's a reduction in volume.4. Headphone quality is not really that great.5. The volume/AAA battery holder has an on-off switch, a volume control, a small indicator light and a max/normal noise cancellation switch. The noise-cancellation has no discernable function. I don't think it's even connected to anything!6. It is comfortable and the ""foldableness"" of the headphones is good.I plan to return these headphones and will go shopping for something maybe a little more expensive, but would actually reduce the noise without reducing the music quality."
2,Not much of a headphone or noise canceling,These would best be described as slight noise reduction not canceling. I tried it at home where my pc fan is quite loud and I could barely tell the different. At work it barely effected the drone of the leave blowers that run for 30 minutes. It effects voices not at all. The headphone have little base with reduction on. These headphones provide practically no isolation from your environment. I'm returning them and looking for something that is effective. I rated 2 stars becasue they are not complete junk.
2,Ahhhhhhhh,"Not even big enough for my head,no high end on frequency.Gave them to relative and bought SONY"
4,Good value,"I purchased the Panasonic RP-HC70 Noise-Canceling Headphones for an upcoming flight across the country and back.I had tested them while mowing my lawn on a 14 hp lawn tractor, they didn't seem to work at all for that, so my expectations were kind of low.Playing with them at the airport, listening to soft rock music was a bit strange. When I turned on the noise canceling feature I got a lot of ""white noise"" and a woman sitting about 20 feet from me all of a sudden became quite loud and I could almost hear her as clearly as if she was standing next to me.On the flight I was quite impressed with the amount of noise reduction. I was able to keep the volume on a portable DVD player at a reasonable level and could hear quite clearly. I would estimate about 50% of the engine noise was canceled. So for less than $30 you can have some extra comfort on flights. I was very impressed with their value to performance ratio."
2,Hate the hiss,"These headphones work, but . . . there is a definite drop in volume when the cancellation feature is on, plus an annoying hiss (like tape hiss) that can get in the way of enjoying what you're listening to. I guess for the price they're okay, but if you're any kind of audiophile you'll want to go elsewhere."
2,uncomfortable and not very effective,"The main problem is they fit ON the ears instead of over them. First problem is that this makes them tiring and irritating to wear for more than a short time and, second, the lack of an over-ear cuff doesn't let them cut out much ambient noise as plenty still comes thru the configuration of the ear (and I don't have large ears)."
4,"Good sound quality, terrible noise cannelling","I have used this headphone for more than a year. It has very good sound quality, which worth the money alone. However, the noise cancelling is useless. Don't expect it to cancel the noise on an airplane."
3,REVIEW,"NOISE CANCELLING FEATURE IS ADEQUATE FOR THE PRICE, HOWEVER I FOUND THE HEAD PHONES TO BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ON THE EARS AFTER ONLY A FEW MINUTES OF USE. AN EAR PAD THAT COVERED THE ENTIRE EAR WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT"
1,drip drip drip,this feeder leaked from the get go..and i tried everything i could to stop it! i would not buy this expensive product!
4,holds a lot,"The feeder is pretty, easy to fill, and holds a lot so I don't have to refill it often. The only problem, is that when it gets really windy, it leaks. We solved it with some silicone."
2,hummingbird feeder,"I purchased this feeder because I thought it was so beautiful. I am still disappointed, and using it, but no longer in the front yard over my porch, because it will not hang straight and drips continually. I now hang it behind my house over grass. It also leaks from around the connection where the bottle and feed openings are. Very disappointed in its design."
3,"Pretty, but....","Although this feeder was very attractive and different-looking, the hummers didn't seem to like it. I'm not sure if it was because there was no red coloring on the feeder or if they just hadn't arrived yet for summer in large numbers, but those I did see wouldn't feed on it. I returned it to the manufacturer, who was wonderful to work with, and have since put up a red-colored feeder that the hummers seem to love!"
1,Leaks,"I bought two of these strictly because they were glass and not plastic. They both had a slow leak. Sticky sugar water always attracts ants - so I constantly had to take the hose and spray down the sticky mess below the feeder. Also, I agree w another poster - the birds are not attracted to these, I had to tie red ribbon to it to ""flag them down"". In the end, I went back to the cheaper, non-leaking, bright red plastic feeders and all was better - much."
2,Broke on the first fill,"I was very pleased with the appearance and size of this feeder and liked that it didn't have any plastic on it. When I was filling it for the first time, I was a little frustrated at the size of the opening, as it was too small to fill without spilling (unless you used a funnel). The real problem came right as it was becoming full, though. I was holding it by the neck, and I guess the neck was too weak to hold the weight of so much water. The glass cracked and the neck broke right off. I was so disappointed!My advice is to not buy this one. If you do decide to buy it, make sure that you support the bottom (actually the top, but it will be upside down) of the glass while filling it rather than simply holding it by the neck."
2,cheap,"I was very disappointed in this feeder. It looked so pretty in the picture, but the feeder in reality looks cheap."
4,Nice product - great service,"I won't use it till Spring, but I really like the way it looks. What I really loved was the service - the first one I received was broken.It was easy to return and the 2nd one arrived in perfect condition. I can't wait to see how my hummingbirds like it."
1,Looks cheap in person,"This item is much cheaper looking in person, not a copper finish like I mistakenly assumed, but a shiny metallic rosy gold and the metalwork bends with a slight touch. What a disappointment, as this was to be a gift, but I will shop at a big box hardware store to find a similar but higher quality item. This looks like a dollar store purchase, way overpriced! This is the first time I have been disappointed by an Amazon purchase."
4,Really pretty,This came in a week earlier than it said it would and is just gorgeous. My granny is going to love this and all the hummingbirds it'll attract. It looks exactly like the picture and was not only wrapped in bubble wrap but had other packaging in the box to prevent it from breaking.
4,Yummy!,"The hummers use it and love it. Thats the test. I have another type [ with red flowers and yellow bee guards ] and the hummers prefer this one now. My only complaint, costing 1 star, is the small leakage from feeding holes caused by light winds. That has attracted bees. This does need some kind of bee guard.I like it for ease of cleaning, filling and for beauty. It's well made, holds lots of nectar and looks wonderful in my tree. FYI You still have to change and clean this at least every 3 days so don't over-fill."
5,Hummer Central,"We have four of these feeders. On a good day, twenty or so hummers dart in and out like crazy.The plastic base can crack as noted be a previous reviewer, but there is no need to screw it on tightly. Our four lasted three years before one of the bases cracked. Gee, what to do? So I bought another one.These feeders are very attractive and don't have the plastic-baby-bottle look of most feeders. If you have a lot of birds, the 32-oz capacity means you don't have to refill quite as often."
2,It only lasted one season...,I bought this product last year for the Hummingbirds and it worked great at first but with in months it began to rust out and now the glass has broken off where it screws into the dispenser. Looks great for display but not the best feeder - have thrown it away since it is not repairable.
2,Too big,"I think this looks so much nicer in the picture than in real life. I bought this to give as a gift but will keep instead. It is really large and therefore takes away from the design. The copper coloring is overwhelming. I had bought because of value and free shipping, but would not recommend."
3,its ann beatufull ornament,looks great buy de humminbird didnt used. Every body ask about the glass and if it works. I just say thad yes buy very early in the morning
1,"Poorly designed, impossible to clean properly","I purchased this hummingbird feeder solely based on the aesthetic value: I thought it looked very pretty.I have had several feeders in the past. But this one beats them all in terms of inconvenience. This feeder is extremely difficult to clean properly: because of its tear-drop shape, you have to find a trick so it doesn't fall in the sink while you're rinsing it. The only method I found was to put it into the garbage disposal...Then the challenge is to find a bottle brush that will reach the end of the bottle...Then you have to shape the brush so that it will clean the sides...When you've managed to do all this, you still have to screw it back properly: again, not easy: somehow the thread isn't well manufactured. So that sometimes when you put it back on, it leaks everywhere...I'm through with this feeder, however pretty it looks, I'm on the market for another design.Seriously, this product leads to a lot of frustration!"
1,Prone to rust,"The beautiful copper finish lasted for a very short period of time. It was soon replaced by massive rust. It is difficult to clean and it also drips very easily. I would definitely not suggest this item.Again, copper plating prone to rust."
2,Pretty but too large!,"Here's the thing - hummingbirds are very territorial. When one is at the feeder, it'll get mad if any others try to feed at the same time. So the problem with this feeder is not really a problem with the feeder, it's a problem with what's being fed! Because they're so temperamental, generally only one bird feeds at a time. So the nectar lasts forever. And if you read the directions on most nectars, they should be drunk within a week, two at most. Which just doesn't happen with this feeder.I've also noticed the base leak if the nectar is left in too long. :(One other thing - I think there is not enough true red on this feeder to really attract the birds. I have a much smaller one that only has a red plastic base, and they go GAGA over it!! It's a pretty garden piece though. So, form over function...? Up to you. I wouldn't recommend it though."
1,Don't buy this one.,"My husband gave this to me as a present and I was so disappointed. After been outside for about 6 weeks, I saw no hummers and it just rusted. I don't think the hummers can see it since it is not red. Unless you have a lot of hummers already that are established, then I would not get this one. I would get the Perky Pet Oasis since I had that one up for less than and hour and I started seeing little hummers."
3,Average documentary,"This documentary does have top name producers in it.The problem for me was it sheds very little light on how Hip Hop beats are made. The conversations are very general, and there is not enough in depth discussion on what equipment to use or beat making techniques. To give benefit of doubt to the film makers, maybe producers were not going to give up trade secrets on camera?It might be good for novices but anyone who actually makes beats will be bored by this."
3,Good Documentary,"Beat Kings is basically a movie on the history of some of the games best Hip-Hop producers, the history of some of them and what kind of machines they use in they're music.The cool things this movie has is the conversations with the producers, even though some of them don't really go in depth with the producer, and they only shed basic light on what they did/do. Also shows some of the producers making beats, and talking about various machines.Some of the bad things about the movie first of all is the length. Its only around 45-50 minutes long. It doesn't go that in depth, but for any hip-hop head I would recommend it since you could learn some things about producers that you didn't previously know.Check it out, but if you decide not to, no worries because your not missing anything important.3-3.5/5."
3,Beat Kings: The History of Hip Hop,"I had a lot of expectation about this one... for example, I thought I would see more in depth on how these amazing producers were using their equipment based on the previewings seen on youtube. I was expecting the producers to show how they deal with the mpc for example. They obviously did not have to reveal their secrets and formulas for making beats because artists like them come up with their own style and it takes a lot hard work to get there. Beat Kings speaks more about the hip-hop culture according to all the pioneers taking part in the DVD. I mean obviously they talk about the MPC and Sp 1200. But who does not know about those?"
5,Beat Kings review,"This DVD is a great inside look at the way producers put together creative concepts. Not just any producer, straight veterans. Those of us that know the sound of the Artists, the beatmakers, can appreciate the way they relay ideas and add to what one would have to already be innovatively thinking--an Artist would already have to be making beats to relate to what these veterans are communicating to the viewer. It is a must have for anyone seeking a career in production.Peace and Respect,JAWwww.plusworks.4t.com"
2,Tight fit for the iPod,"This would be probably be best for a mini. It was just too tight for the color screen iPod. After working hard to squeeze it in, I had to pull it back out to make any selections on the iPod. It looks good and fits well but it's just not 'user-friendly'."
1,has mineral oil,Don't understand why mineral must be in most hair care products when there are so many different oils that are healthier. Had to give it away to some one that didn't mind having it.
3,hair,My hair was really greasy for a while afterward. Had to shampoo a couple of times to get it all out. Didn't notice a difference afterwards
3,Just ok,I bought this because of dry hair and shedding issues. It really didn't do much for my hair long term. It was ok while it was in but didn't make a big enough difference for me to reorder.
5,Nourished my hair,My tight curly hair was dry and dull before I used this product. It brought it back to life.
5,Great documentation of drawing development,This book is a thorough record of one child's natural development in drawing. Having so many images makes it clear to see the progression through various stages. It's also clear how each stage has its own value and serves as a foundation for the next. Seeing what the child drew on her own time and out of her own interest is also beneficial. An amazing documentation of a child's development complete with the ages noted for each image.
3,Good buy for at-home use,Easy to install - This took less than 5 minutes to put in and put to use.Comfortable to use - This is a sturdy bar and doesn't rotate during use like some of the others reviewed on this site.Some slight negatives - The hand grips are a little difficult to adjust (but they probably should be). You occasionally need to hand-tighten the bar between uses.
5,table edge bumper,"love love love this bumper.......this bumper is one of the only ones i've found that my boys can't remove. I too purchased the small to fit my medium table and was very pleased. This is my second bumper as we replaced our first when our second child became mobile. The only down side is that ""gunk"" does tend to get stuck under the bumper so you need to pay special attention when cleaning it....."
2,Too much slack and ugly too,"I wasn't hoping for perfection, but I'm disappointed in this bumper. Our rectangular table is 136 inches, and there is way too much slack for this bumper to do much good. If our 10-month-old pulls on it to pull up, it easily stretches a good 3-4 inches away from the table edge. It doesn't do it's job protecting her and she's actually bumped her head on the table when cruising on the table and plopping back down. Any contact with the bumper and it just sags such that it no longer covers the edge. The corners are awkward, too. They are just fabric covered pads, and they tend to stick out from the bumper visibly. Overall, the pad is pretty ugly. The light grey color sticks out like a sore thumb against our wood table. I was hoping to avoid having to use the kind of bumper that you have to stick on, but I'll be ordering some of those now."
2,bumper too big or too small,"My table is about 141 inches around. The small sized bumper was too small, and the medium is too big. We're using the big one and it kind of hangs onto the table."
1,Read this for help with the size!!!,"I was extremely annoyed to find NO information on this website about the dimensions of this bumper. I took a guess and ordered the small for our square wooden 40"" x 40"" table. It didn't come close to fitting and now apparently I have to pay to ship it back to Amazon. I have now ordered the medium, which will probably be too large and I'll have to pay to ship that one back as well. This website is lacking some vital product information that would be helpful to consumers. Very disappointing experience."
3,Toooo Big!!,"I bought both the small and medium size bumpers. They are both too big, even though my tables measured towards the larger sizing. I had to put foam pieces on the corners to take up the slack. I think an extra small size would be better for most people's end tables, since most of the reviews have the same criticism about sizing. Also, I have had them on the tables for 2 months now and they have still not straightened out. The idea is a great one, but the sizing needs to be reevaluated."
3,not good for rectangular table,"My table is the largest size in their description, yet there is still too much slack to use it safely. Baby would be able to pull the bumper far from the table & fall or hit the table. It might work fine on a round table, though."
3,Small Expandable Table Edge Bumper,"The bumpers work really well to cushion the edges of tables and prevent little teeth from gnawing. However, the table size listed on the box is exteremly far off. The bumpers fit a table closer to 1 1/2 times the size listed on the box. I had to use binder clips to hold a fourth of the bumper on the back of the table who's circumference is well within the limit of the bumper."
5,Stays on and gives cushion,"I'm glad I read the reviews prior to ordering. Based on measurement the medium-sized bumper should have fit. But, after reading reviews, I ordered the small bumper. It fits great and stays on. My little one can still pull herself up and tug on it without pulling the bumper off. The extra pieces for the corners are nice -- gives plenty of cushion."
4,No More Bumps!,"I thought this item was great! Everyone told me to just remove my coffee table until my daughter got bigger. I read a few of the reviews and decided to try it myself. I ordered the small bumper which supposedly fit the dimensions of my table, but like someone else said..it stretched alot further when my little one tugged on it. I just pulled it tight and marked it. I then cut it and sewed it. I had to fight to get it on the table, but it works beautifully now. (I did break a couple needles sewing it!)I would definately recommend this to anyone, but get a smaller size than you think you need."
3,"Good, but one problem..","We ordered the small bumper for our retangular marble top coffee table, and it fit well, but the longer sides still are not snug. Our 1 year old can easily pull the middle of the longer sides away from the table (it was the first thing she did!), so this doesn't protect her from hiting her head on the table.We tried to figure a ""fix"" for this problem, but the only solution was either to cut it & sew it shorter, or put the table in storage...we returned this item, not wanting to spend the time trying to make it fit by attempting to shorten it.I would reccommend this for round or oval tables only."
3,Sizes run LARGE,"This bumper isn't pretty, but if it saves an eye it could be far uglier! Our rectangular table is 151"". We bought the SMALL because of others' reviews. It fits very snug and our son won't be able to pull it off, like he has everything else. I would say a 152"" - 152"" table would be about the largest you would want for this SMALL. Any larger and you *might* rip the bumper."
4,Head saver,This item has saved my daughter many bumps and bruises and probably even a few cuts!! This is a great item although the child can pull it off the table when he gets bigger. I still would not do without mine!!!
3,Provides very thick padding,"This is a great product for low coffee tables but is easily puled down once your child pulls himself up, then it serves little purpose."
4,Simple yet Difficult,"I bought it for a slightly odd shaped table. It took some effort, but I finally got it to fit. So far, it has not been tested, thank goodness."
3,pretty good,It was good but should have had more dance songs on it. The first two are very good and so is walk away but i must admit-for wanting this album for so long i'm dissapointed.
5,"no love is right as ours, none shines as bright as ours",I'm from North Carolina and I bought a BSB All Access movie and came with a bonus sampler cd and had Solid HarmoniE on it. I listened to it and my favorite one was Solid HarmoniE's song. I went to the store to look for it and couldn't find it then I heard about amazon.com and I found it. The album is fantastic......! I waited a whole year for it!
5,In one word Talent!,"These four beautiful girls sure can sing! This album is amazingly touching and beautiful! It's a shame they aren't as well known as Spice Girls because a song like ""I Wanna Love You"" is so lovely and it's a shame it can't be appreciated like Wannabe!"
1,Disappointing and misleading,"The pamphlet (so it describes itself internally) is titled as if it were a discussion of the US propaganda establishment, but is in truth a sketchy and afactual memoir of a two-year Clinton-erainternship in USIA. The pamphlet is only 60 pages long, beingprefaced by laudatory and emotional prefaces that stretch to 30pages, probably reflecting some demand of the printing process.About 20 pages of the pamphlet is devoted to demanding that the USIA be disbanded, the remainder to rambling far-left invectivesagainst the NAFTA, ""globalization"", ""hegemonic corporations"" andother betes noires. This pamphlet may well be part of a tenure-quest rather than a knowledge quest. The reader is advised to seek knowledge elsewhere."
1,Tinikling set with handles,"TINIKLING SET WITH HANDLES. This is for teaching a Filipino dance to children who spent long hours researching and studying this country. They were very disappointed when they saw it. They are suppossed to be bamboo sticks.This product was a bunch of crap. Nowhere does it specify that it is PVC pipe put together. For the money, it was outrageous. This is something that could be made by products in our local hardware store by a novice. If you are going to advertise a product, please specify that you did not even try to make it look authentic (fake looking bamboo). I am disappointed and will no longer purchase or recommend this product."
4,Mild BDSM,"Both stories in this book have a descent plot, but mostly the stories are based on ""torturing"" a captive female with lots of sexual arousal through toys. Since the female characters love sex, the torture aspect isn't really believable. The chemistry between the main characters is believable, though."
3,"Love the smell, but not a good deodorant.","I LOVE the smell of this perfume, but it does not work well as a deodorant for me. I have to use regular deodorant, then spray this on top just for the great smell."
5,Unforgettable,This was one of the best books that I've ever read. I was devastated when I lost my copy and found that it went out of print -- but Amazon located another one for me and I just read it again. The step class was even better then 2nd time. I read a lot of books and this is the first time that I'd like to contact the author.
5,Great score from Hollywood's golden era,"This is a re-recording (by the always-excellent Joel McNeely conducting the Royal Scottish National Orchestra) of Frank Waxman's music for the 1940 film ""Rebecca."" The movie is historically notable for a number of reasons: it won the Oscar for Best Picture; it was Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood film; and it was produced by David O. Selznick concurrently with another little film he produced, ""Gone with the Wind."" The music was written by German immigrant Franz Waxman, and is lush, gorgeous stuff in the way only scores from this particular era of Hollywood can manage.The CD is about 55 minutes long, and is composed of 18 tracks. It's a great score, one that gets better with every listen. And as if the score weren't reason enough to buy the CD, the liner notes on the somewhat troubled history of the film in general and the scoring process in particular are fantastic.Highly recommended to people who love film music."
2,Unless you are writing a paper on PLL don't buy this book,I would not recommend this book for anyone who has to design a simply PLL. The book covers all the possibly ways to analyze a PLL (the author is showing off) but practical applications (e.g. a simply receiver) to connect all the theory is missing. A book with most of the theory with applications would be much better.
3,These Caricatures are not Endearing!,"Mr. Wolfe's caricatures are gross exaggerations of the human form and may not appeal to potential doll or figure sculpters. They are remarkable specifically because they are so grotesque! Mr. Wolfe does give several hints that would benefit dollmakers - create a concave hole in the end of an appropriately-sized dowel to sculpt eyeballs directly in the face clay, or to hold a separately created eyeball in position for adhering to the face clay. I'm glad I read through the book, but it's not one I intend to keep as reference material."
5,Great playing acceptable sound quality,"Impeccable performance. The playing is slightly less free than Bavouzet's. As for what they call ""natural echo"", it is too deep and/or mic is too far away from the instrument. The recording sound does not fully convey the nuance and gloss of tone."
4,Stylish and Easy to Wear,"My 3 year old can put them on without help. Width is always our issue, but so hard to find in most shoes. Stride rite always has great stylish quality shoes in the width that my son needs. I was hesitant about purchasing these particular spire slip on because, I was worried that without laces or velcro to adjust on my own they would fail to be tight enough for him. I was wrong these shoes stretch the perfect amount to ensure comfort. A+! Great Buy!"
3,Decent quality. Does its job.,"I ordered this casette adapter in order to be able to play music from my phone and mp3 player in my car through its cassette slot.In terms of build quality, the adapter is rather cheap. The cable feels very light and insubstantial, and not in a good way. Flimsy, you could say. The cassette part of the adapter also feels flimsy, with plastic that flexes and doesn't inspire confidence.As for sound quality, this adapter is slightly worse than some other adapters I've used, though not by much, considering the low quality provided by cassette adapters in general. All in all, it'll work.Overall, price is the main thing this adapter has going for it ($0.01 + $2.99 shipping). Quality is lower-than-average, but the adapter is still usable if treated nicely.I'd recommend an adapter of just a tad higher quality, but this one works just fine."
2,Broke within a month,"After about a month of use (only on the weekends!) this thing started making clicking noises and sounding funny. Within another month it was making louder clicking/grinding noises, and would randomly pop out in the middle of use. Within another month it was no longer useable! It's cheap though, so I guess you could just keep replacing them."
4,"Oscar Peterson Trio , The Early days.","This album , from 1949 , represents oscar at one of those "" never to be repeated "" times , massive flowing chords , dazzling technique , rich improvisation .. I love it !"
4,Not Oscar material... but,"This movie is not Oscar material but it is an entertaining movie. Contains some ""tongue in cheek"" humor and does seem to have somewhat of a plot. Good family entertainment. 3D looked pretty good on our Samsung Plasma. My wife says that the sequel was better than the original (I did not see the original).Since there are animals playing the parts, I expected that the scenes might be choppy due to cutting and splicing. However, the action flowed fairly well."
2,BORING!!!,"Cats and Dogs was a childish boring movie. My dog died in late November last year and my mom said we will get another dog in a year, so we kept pausing during the movie and said things like ""Oh he is cute!"" ""This breed of dogs are intelligent!"" But this movie is ok because it shows kids the variety of cats and dogs."
3,Ok,The movie is just ok. The 3D is the only thing going for it....plus it's about animals. I only got this because I love animals (dogs).
4,Cats & Dogs,Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (Three Disc: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)
4,Cats & Dog 2,"Not a horrible but it was okay. I thought Maramaduke was better, but if you want to keep the kids entertained then check this one out. It's silly and goofy and one the kids will love!"
4,Dog VS Cat and in 3D,It is a fun romp of man's best friend and mine..the DOG VS that evil Kitty Galore and in 3D too.
5,a very enjoyable movie,This movie is great for all ages and anyone who loves animal movies. There are many funny moments and suitable for all ages.
3,Not as good as Original,Was excited about this release but was a bit disappointed. Worth a watch but doesnt compare to the ist.
4,Cats and Dogs 3D Blu-ray.,"Love the movie. Quite funny and cute. Looks great in 3-D. More of a kids movie, although fun to watch if your an adult aswell."
4,"Liked it, but they need to come up with LESS dog/cat movies!","I liked this movie when I saw it in theatres, but they need to make less dog/cat movies. Especially dogs! About how Digs (the dog) allies with the team against Kitty Galore. And how they save the dog world............"
5,The best movie yet!,"I rented this movie for New Year's Eve so that we wouldn't have to watch the boring shows for New Year. Totally lame shows. So we got Egg Nog Ice Cream and sat down on the couch and watched the movie. Well it was a total hit! I couldn't decide which was my favorite character. My wife said that Kitty Galore was the ugliest cat ever but I thought she was cute as a button. Don't worry she isn't a tiny button, it's just an expression! Anyway... I loved this movie and my family adored it. The best movie that I ever saw!"
4,Fast Delivery!!,"I did not expect to get my purchase as quick as I did, but it arrived in almost half of the time which was great. I bought it for a Christmas present fo my son, so we haven't watched it yet, but it came completely sealed and everything just like you would buy it off the store shelf, so I am not anticipating any problems. A plus I was able to purchase it from an animal rights place, which made it all the better! Definately happy with the purchase."
3,Kitty Galore's original name? Ivana Clawyu.,"Where was that adorable little black pug that was featured on the cover!?! Hardly in the movie I'll tell you that. Was this a good movie? Woof. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Did I enjoy it? Meow, yes. A sequel that no one was asking for, ""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" offered a few chuckles, some uneven but adequate special effects, and a great opening sequence lampooning the older James Bond movies' opening credits. Kids'll love it...teenagers will probably be meh toward it...and people young at heart will find this a throw-a-way trifle. Safe for all ages."
2,Cats & Dogs,Case not in good condition have not checked the DVD yet.Little disappointed considering supposed to be new.New in a very confused text I think.My Dvd case was cut on the top. The postal package not damaged at all.So Not happy.
4,Good movie for young kids. cute. fun.,"This was a good move for family movie night. funny and cute. and short and sweet, too, for the adults."
1,Not suited for teens or adults,This movie is only suitable for viewers between 2 and 6yrs old. No one in our family liked it at all.
5,movie,my son wanted this movie couldnt findfound heregreat pricemovie looked brand newwonderful jobwill order several more thing soon
2,Too Silly,"The best part of this movie was the James Bond like intro in the beginning. It went downhill from there and got sillier and sillier.Sometimes the idea of talking animals works, in this case it just did not work for me. Note that I am reviewing this as an adult, children will probably enjoy it more. I am not opposed to the idea of animals talking in the movies. For example the pixar movie 'Finding Nemo' in which fish talked appealed to all ages and I liked that one. This one is a-ok.My 2 cents.."
4,Likes it.,"Our son liked this one. The ""treasure"" is what got his attention. He's very much into pirates and treasures lately. But in all honesty, he doesn't ask to watch it that much. Seems he likes the one with Trusty friends moreThomas & Friends: Thomas' Trusty Friends. He watches that one for inspiration to play with his Thomas sets. And more recently the one he watches more often is the one with HeroThomas & Friends: Hero of the Rails. He likes the characters and he likes the racing between Thomas and Spencer."
3,POP GOES THE RADIO,"RADIO DAZE/POP HITS OF THE 80'S, VOL.3-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Rhino Records is the retro compilation company that expertly bridges the gap between K-Tel kitschy various artists releases of the 70's and the NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC sampler series of today. Each volumn of RADIO DAZE contains a dozen pop 40 favorites from the decade that gave us legwarmers and spikey 'dos. Ex-Rascal leader Felix Cavaliere and a pre-stardom Vince Gill (fronting Pure Prarie League), blue eyed soul wailer Benny Mardones, and son-of-retro-royalty Rocky Burnette all make welcome cameos here. Remember Ambrosia? Al Stewart? Tommy Tutone? Somewhere in the cobwebbed recesses of your mind, believe me, you DO. But hey, don't take a lowly critic's word for it...check out RADIO DAZE, VOL.3 and find out for yourself how much fun 80's MOR trivia can be.RATING: THREE MELLOW-DIES"
2,OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW,I am currently writing this review with an ice pack on my ear because of the major hand tools it takes to put this earring in. The ball that clasps on to the bottom of the earring is IMPOSSIBLE to put in when the earring is in your ear. I learned an important lesson today and will not be purchasing any product with this design again.
2,Not a great remake,"The young voice is missing on this one. I have some of the same songs on vinyl records. If I had listened to it first, I would not have bought it. It might be OK for someone not familiar with the original recordings."
1,Kitty Wells 20 all time greatest hits,"The date of this review is June 17th 2010 and we have not received this CD ""Kitty Wells 20 All Time Greates Hits"" and personally afraid we will never receive it."
3,Save your money,"It's an okay book, but I think this is more of an intermediate book instead of advanced and was somewhat disappointing, although not entirely, it does have quite a few useful exercises, if anything I'm mostly disappointed because this book does'nt have enough lessons nor cover ALL the advanced features that they left out in the other Photoshop / Illustrator CIAB series. I would say buy this book if you have 30 bucks to spare for a little extra knowledge of PS/IL, but if you just want that PERFECT advanced photoshop book, you MUST buy Adobe Photoshop 6 Studio Techniques, which is also by the fine fellows at Adobe Press, otherwise it is pretty weak at covering advanced Adobe Illustrator."
1,Adobe Should Pull This Book or Give it Away for Free!,"This book seems to be missing about half of the functionality of these two applications. It does not flow well, and does not cover information for web developers. This is NOT one of the better reference materials produced by Adobe. You would do well not to waste your hard-earned money on this one."
1,Digression is a terrible thing...,"Adobe is great- we all know that. They also make some pretty rockin books for their products. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!! This is why-I used the Photoshop 5.5 & Illustrator 8.0 book in school, and its great, so I thought I would buy the new version, and even if only one or two lessons were updated or changed to reflect the new abilities of the two programs, I would be happy. Sure enough-FOUR LESSONS HAVE JUST BEEN DELETED!! Not replaced with anything!!! So, those of you that have Photoshop 6.0 CIB are used to 17 lessons- buy this book and pay ($$$) for NINE!! The last version of this book is great, but I returned this one. I WAS ROBBED!"
2,Some serious instruction deficiencies,"I really like the concept of what Adobe is doing in this book series. Yet, in Lessons on masking in lesson 4 and layering in Lesson 5 provided instructions that just did not work. This both surprised and obviously frustrated me. The other lessons worked fine - come on Adobe rework lessons 4 and 5 - you can do better than this!!!"
5,Good solid book,This is a solidly wriiten book on criminal activity in Boston and arms smuggling to Ireland. The author pulls no punches about what he did and offers no apologies to the lifestyle he choose. You can either love or hate him but he seems to be a respectable guy from this book. The co-authors do a pretty good job putting his voice into a readable manner.
3,"Irishmen will enjoy it most, others might not","Nee's true-crime novel about his days running with Southie's Irish Mob and working with rogue IRA members is pretty intriguing. His descriptions of Ireland and secret meetings with the IRA and other Boston hoods (most notably, none other than Whitey Bulger, of course) were well written. Nee, a retired Southie hood and die-hard Irish nationalist, wrote a fairly decent book here but will not appeal to all gangster fans. I surely enjoyed it but plenty of other books on the Boston Irish Mob that overshadows this.3 stars."
4,Patrick Nee/Boston Mob IRA Connection,"A fascinating story. More detail on the intriguing story of the IRA gun smuggling ship ""Valhalla"". The only reason I take a way one star is I wanted more speculation on the part of Nee as to who betrayed the ship to the British Authorities.According to Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mobby Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill it was Whitey Bulger himself.Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the Fbi, and a Devil's Deal"
4,Honest,"This is a good read for the casual reader. Nee is pretty honest about his story, and does not try to glorify himself, but lists himself as what he is, a criminal. Nee gives explanations as to why he is a criminal and his end cause. This gives another view of Whitey that is not often seen from his insiders. Nee sheds some light on the Southie-IRA connection, but does not go too indepth. It is a short read, simple, easy to follow, and very readable."
1,Boring,"If you have read a book about a retired criminal, you have read this book. Boring and I could barely make it through the first chapter. Nice wall piece and looks good on the shelf. Suggested reading would be the book written by another man involved in this ring. This book is a waste of paper."
3,How do you serve as a marine and not think of yourself as an American?,"I had high hopes for this one, in light of the pros working with Nee. It just seemed to degenerate into a political polemic, however, about half way through; almost like two mini-books with stange pacing by the editor. Without trying to, I found myself mentally substituting ""Al Qaeda"" for IRA, trying unsuccessfully to differentiate in my mind why these guys were substantially different from middle eastern ""freedom fighters"". Left unexamined was the tragic way his family started him on his path in life, making him a really angry guy in general. Despite service in the USMC, he doesn't refer to himself as an American throughout most of the book. I really wish I could have liked this one more but I know plenty of guys like Nee who made better life choices."
4,Learn about Spiritual Gifts,"If you want an easy to read and understand book about Spiritual Gifts, this is one. I had read this book for my own personal development after hearing Charles Stanley teach about Spiritual Gifts on the radio. I used this as the textbook for a Bible Study I lead for 8-10 women and they loved it. They found it useful, easy to follow, and they like the reflective questions."
3,Purchased for church bible study.,This reads too much like a horoscope where people who are in my group try fit their experiences and skills into a spiritual gift. The gift descriptions are more like personality characteristics that anyone would exibit rather than Holy Spirit endowed spiritual gifts.
3,Big Bug Eyes!,"I bought these to wear over my prescription sun glasses with my half-helmet. They are huge! I'm into that crazy bug-eye look, so it's okay, but I have to push my helmet back far enough so the goggles won't press my nose closed. I also got them because of the interchangeable lenses, which are tricky at first. If you don't need to wear prescription glasses underneath, you might be better off with smaller goggles, but I'm happy with them and they work great otherwise."
3,"Great, but","These are quality goggles, but they do not fit over all glasses. They do not fit at all over my aviator-style sun glasses. They do fit over my indoor glasses which have a small frame, but just barely and not perfectly. If you don't wear glasses you will be very happy with these goggles, if you wear glasses you may be dissatisfied."
4,good,The product was delievered in a timely manner but the folders were longer than I thought. for the price I couldn't beat it.
5,IT PPM Review,"I found Mr. Bonham's book on IT PPM to be very informative, and one of the first books that I have read specifically pretaining to IT project portfolio managment. There were many use cases and detailed discussions, that provide practical development of the Mr. Bonham's IT PPM knowledge strategy. Each chapter contains take-aways that can often be applied directly to current IT projects. In addition, the level of research within the book (references, resources, etc), far outweights many other PPM books that I have read. Overall, I would highly recommend this book as a very useful tool for those looking to positively align their IT organizational workflows."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"My daughter encouraged me to buy this CD, and it was not what I was hoping for. I find the tones just a bit too high for me. But its a nice CD, because my daughter just love it. I think I need the sound a little lower tones."
2,ok,I wanted this for my reiki practice while giving reiki to clients I find it a bit eerie in sound and I probobly will not use it for client work.
5,hours of fun,I had one of these as a kid in the late 50's and I must have played with it for years. I still have it today.It must have influenced me a lot because I went into the building trades and I went on to school and studied building and design and still work in that field today.
5,Excellent Book on faith,"This book, written mainly by Yonggi Cho and Schuller, sheds light on practical bible-based faith. Both authors share testimonies and even failures along the way of how they used faith to obtain their miracles. Yonggi Cho especially follows up his testimony with the way he uses faith at home. Both authors speak explicitly using easily understood language, which makes the book interestingly sequential. Although this book was written in 1985, its simple principles are still very applicable today."
5,Open Door to the Past,"The Door in the Wall proves that Gore Vidal hasn't cornered the market on fiction about ancient Rome. The character of Marcus Caelius Rufus, politician and rebel, is superbly and sympathetically drawn--the novel's supporting cast (Caesar, Catullus, Mark Antony, and Cicero) has been equally well brought to life. Jaro is erudite but never ponderous in her recreation of some of the seminal events in western history. She's also an elegant prose stylist, something one sees all too seldom these days."
1,Beware!,"Beware! I recently purchased a top of the line Electrolux Icon oven and wanted to protect my investment. I purchased this oven liner based on other positive reviews. This oven liner ""MELTED"" on the bottom of my brand new oven!!! It left an unsightly white residue and also bent the bottom oven cover while trying to move the oven liner that was stuck to the bottom of the oven. I am extremely upset. After contacting the company, they suggested cleaning it with baking soda. After many, many applications, the ugly white residue is still there. Buyer beware on this product!Nonstick Oven Liner (Black) (23"" L x 16.25"" W)"
3,Sugar Stanley Turrentine,It's a shame that the fourth track (Gibraltar) on the original LPwasn't included it was replaced for a live version of Sugar wichis great but it's disappointing not to have that track from the original recording.Also the remaster it's not good at all it makes the horns and the guitar sound really dull compared to the original recording.
5,"""Sugar""...Stanley Turrentine","This was probably Stanley Turrentine's finest album, and by far the greatest commercial success of his long and illustrious career. ""Best Jazz Album of the Year"", a Grammy, etc. You will fine some excellent compositions here and his saxophone never sounded better. If you haven't been a Stanley Turrentine fan, then this album will turn you into one!"
3,Another example of CTI diluting jazz legends,"CTI was one of the most prolific jazz labels of the early 1970s. Many of their records are fantastic...Red Clay- Freddie Hubbard is fantastic. But all too many of their records hint at what would later become smooth jazz. This is one of those dates, while the music is very good, the tone of the album is missing a rawness."
4,Works like it should,"I don't know how many of you have used this product for bedding a windshield in an old car, but those that have would agree that it is messy but effective. An old mechanic friend of mine once told me ""you could be talking on the phone with someone while you were using it and it would get all over THEM too!"". It cleans up with mineral spirits and soapy water, which took longer than it did to put in the windshield and back glass on my 57 Ford."
4,Nice Recipe Storage Solution,"I love this book. It's classy and sturdy. There is an Equivalent Measures chart inside the front cover, 12 tabbed dividers, and 40 recipe cards arranged in 20 protector sheets.My one disappointment was with the tabbed dividers. I wish they would have been blank (or that they at least included a few blank ones) because I wouldn't have organized my recipes in the same way they do. Tabs include: Appetizers, Soups-Salads, Sauces-Dressings, Breads-Grains, Dairy-Eggs, Fruits-Vegetables, Pasta, Poultry, Seafood, Meats, Desserts, and Beverages.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase and will be ordering another."
5,Perfect Gift,I received this recipe organizer as a gift from my Mother-in-law and I absolutely love it. The red leather cover is beautiful and modern. I've transferred all my recipes into this binder because it is so easy to use and the cards are protected from spills. I love it so much I'm purchasing it for my mother-in-law for her birthday. A perfect gift for anyone!
4,Almost perfect...,"I purchased this binder for a recipe swap at my cousin's bridal shower. The red leather is beautiful and its a perfect size. I love that the cards are 4x6 and the spill-proof covers are great.While the cover is beautiful, the inside cards themselves are cheesy and outdated. I *almost* threw the cards away infavor of plain 4x6 replacements. The book also only came with 40 cards (20 pages) which is not enough for a recipe collection. Almost anyone would need to order refills."
5,The Perfect Recipe Card Organizer,"I searched several stores for 'The Perfect Recipe Card Organizer', however ended up empty handed. I ordered this recipe card holder, hoping that it would work out for what I needed and it is ""The Perfect Recipe Card Organizer"". A friend of mine is celebrating their 1st Wedding Anniversary, I sent a letter and recipe cards to everyone they invited to their wedding and asked them to share their favorite family recipes, etc. I wanted the perfect book to put them into and this is it! I am so grateful and think I am going to order more to keep as gifts and to 'refresh' my recipe collection!"
5,Everything was great,The book came on time. It was gorgeous and my friend (male) seemed to like it. Overall I think it was a great product
5,Recipe Card Organizer,I am very pleased with this recipe book. The outer cover is very nice and there a many options for dividing.
3,a pretty good book,I have to admit it was very interesting and I did read it in about 2 weeks I wouldnt say its one of my favorites but its a good book about a teen dealing with his urges of having a crush on his brothers gay best friend. its a great book for understanding and very meaningful.
5,Just Beautiful,"This book is a wonderful surprise! A very well written story. Impossible we don't get involved with the characters. Peter is priceless, and the relationship with his brother, Vince, his mother, and David, give us a breathe of happiness and, why not, hope in believing that are people with free minds. The great surprise to me, and a good one, is the relationship with his brother. And what I desire for Peter: in three years from the ""end"" of the history, he meets David in the way he wants. This book must be read, indeed. It's a beautiful story."
3,Quick read,Fair book with a coming out story of a teen. I was really disappointed that he did not even get at least a kiss out of the entire story especially near the end. Wish it had just a bit more.
3,Arctic Fives Arrive,"The book Arctic Fives Arrive is an okay childrens book. It doesn't really make much sense in the beggining though. Childrens books don't have too though i guess. I didn't like the ending on it because i couldn't even understand what it was talking about. All in all though, the book to me would rank 3 out of 5 stars."
5,An Excellent book for beginners & professionals!,"Mr. Waldbauer offers a very well-presented book, which is arranged with enough eas for beginners to perform and for professionals to use as a chart for entertaining during the holidays. This well-known composer & violinist will hopefully be publishing more books soon!Buy it while you can! Your students and audiences will love it!"
2,Only a few examples; no mass appeal,"I don't understand why the other three reviewers liked this slim volume. It just has a few code examples covering a handful of niche topics that I feel few people know or care about. Financial research is a really rich and diverse field, ranging from accounting to options pricing to technical analysis. This book covers a minimal amount of topics. I don't think this is helpful at all. If someone could write a ""SAS cookbook"" a la ""Perl Cookbok"" that would be great."
1,bad,"my friend was using this amp on his two 10"" square kickers and it worked fine but by the time i hooked it up on my rockford fosgate which are two 12"" p3 the amp worked for about 5min then went bad it couldnt handle the rms and the watts so the amp went bad and made my system sound bad so this is good amp for smalls low power subs."
5,An Inspiration,"This book is an evolution from Ratzlaff's earlier work. It marries art and the sometimes unnoticed complexity of midwestern life. It incorporates beautiful language, landscapes, and life in a unique way. Another review on this page professed that they could have written this poetry, and I think that is wholy untrue. Ratzlaff brings a voice to the page that is unique. Recently I saw, Billy Collins, former United States poet laureate, who defined good poetry as poetry that makes you jelous that you didn't write it. I believe this book does just that."
2,BAMAC,Not worth the price - about the size of a notebook. it's heavy duty but not worth what i paid!
5,Animaniacs stew VHS,1.Slappy goes walnut. the frist slappy squirrel cartoon2. Operation lollipop3. Sir yaksalot4. Bumbie's mom5. In the Garden of Mindy6. Baghdad Cafe7. Yes always
3,Not The Best one,"I liked this Animaniacs collection, but it wasn't my favorite. Unlike the other reviewers, I would think that if you owned only one, you would want some of the classics. You don't want Brain in Button's place, you want a classic ""Pinky & The Brain."" I am an Animaniacs purist. :)"
1,UNHAPPY,As of today I still haven't received my CD that I ordered over a month ago. I ordered other CD'S directly from AMAZON.COM and I received ALL of them. I ordered two CD's from personal sellers and I never received either one. I am still waiting on a response from this seller inregards to my refund. I am very unhappy because I really really wanted this CD:(
2,how terrible can you get,"ok i cant believe i wasted money on this cd...twista's flow and kanye's production are the only bright spots on the whole cd...twista's one verse lights up everybody else like a ...christmas tree..i thought that the ROC was steadily takin over the game but after hearing this im having second thoughts half these cats lyrics arent worthy of getting their name on a post-it let alone a contract and M.O.P. made a big mistake signin with the ROC,their style is on the other side of the spectrum compared to what Rocafella is known for.Im glad Twista's contract is just a appearance deal and not a full album contract,I'd hate to see someone with so much overlooked talent be ruined before he gets his chance"
3,"Nice idea, but it breaks","The mug is nice, and worked as expected. But after some time I have noticed some scratch on the mug. And I stopped using it as I might spill the hot water because the mug breaks or cracks unexpectedly. Having said that, I think that the mug was too expensive. However, maybe I had a bad luck."
4,Fun gift,This makes a fun little gift- but it's NOT dishwasher safe. Watch parts of the world disappear with your morning coffee. A little depressing but still a fun party trick...
1,Skip it...,"I bought this and found out that the graphics on the mug are simply liquid adhered decals. These are stickers that are soaked in warm water to bond them to what they are intended to decorate. That's why it cant be washed in a dishwasher. It also means it better not be left to soak in a sink either. Eventually even hand washing it will leave you with a plain blue mug with no graphics, which is pretty near to what I currently have after several months of regular use and absurdly careful hand washing.I would not recommend this mug(or any other hand wash only mug), as it isn't good for anything more than very infrequent beverage use or keeping pencils in. Your money would be better spent on a mug that uses glazing to affix the decorative designs to it."
3,"Ok, but do not put in dishwasher","I bought this for my husband and he loved it! He knew not to put it in the dishwasher but accidently/absentmindedly did so last week. Unfortunately several continents are now gone. But hey, it's a cute novelty. In retrospect, not my best purchase. :)"
3,Peels off,"Cool concept, but the world peels off. Just pretend that the disappearing land is the result of global warming/humans destroying themselves, and this cup will be even cooler!."
2,no dishwasher!,"i was really excited about this mug, but it was accidentally put in the dishwasher and Japan washed right off and stuck to one of my plates. now the whole decal is flaked and chipping. it's too bad, especially for one accidental cycle on the top rack."
3,Good enough,"We bought this as a gift for our Biology teacher at the end of the year. Before giving it to her though, we decided to have a look at it. It's a good mug, but the designs are basically just a sticker. That's why you can't wash this mug in a dishwasher, you have to wash it by hand.I also got the Disappearing Dinosaur mug, and it was the same thing; just a sticker. After using it for a while, the sticker started to come off a little bit, so you have to be careful when washing it. This is somewhat disappointing for something that someone potentially uses every day.Nevertheless, if the sticker peels off, the mug is still a good mug."
2,North and South America are gone!,"I got this as a gift and enjoyed it for awhile. Then, as I was hand-washing it (I don't own a dishwasher), both North and South America sloughed off in my hand in little plastic pieces. I thought global warming is going to be bad, but not that bad. I better search Amazon for a boat."
2,"""Names and dates, names and dates""",I'm surprised that the author completely ignored the economic conditions of France during the reign of Catherine. No mention of the economic force played by the Huguenots. Just names and dates. Author took a three-dimensional figure and reduced her to one-dimension. Just names and dates.
1,Too bad you can't give it zero stars!,"BAD, BAD covers! You have to wonder how much more it would have cost to buy the rights to the original recordings instead of hiring wannabe bands! We got about fifteen seconds into four or five tracks, and actually threw the CD away! Don't buy this, even as a joke!"
1,Shrinks,"I bought this and thought it would be a good idea to wash it before I put it onto the crib mattress. I washed according to the instructions (in fact, the pad was still a bit damp when I removed it from the dryer (tumble dry on low heat)) and the mattress pad had shrunk so much that it no longer fit onto the mattress. I do not recommend this. In search for another...."
4,HeatherMN,My husband and I purchased this mattress pad and have had no complaints about it. Our baby is not due until April of this year but we have already washed our nursery bedding items several times. We have had no problem with shrinkage or the pad not fitting our mattress. We purchased a Pali crib with standard size mattress and all of our bedding has fit perfect...including this mattress pad. We have no complaints.
1,It really really doesn't fit!,"Ok, I just got done wrestling with this pad....I had high hopes and thought I would try it regardless of the reviews...IT REALLY DOESN'T FIT. I mean off by a long shot and I cannot even imagine the fit after it was washed. There are way too many pads to choose from to waste time, money and wrestling moves trying this one out."
5,Works for us,This mattress pad adds just the right thickness to make our daughter's bed very comfortable. It comes with a waterproof cover for the mattress and that has worked great for us. Our daughter had many accidents when she was a newborn and nothing ever got through. We have therefore washed the pad multiple times and have never had a problem with it fitting the mattress.
4,Moogle,The moggle looks just like the one in Final Fantasy ten.It is very cute I can't wait to get more swag.
5,Worked exactly as expected,Used in snorkeling in moderate depths and it worked exactly as expected. Controls where easy to use underwater. Underwater mode on the camera did a decent job on adjusting for the changing light conditions
5,Totally worth the price.,Great product. Underwater cameras are so expensive that it's worth getting this case for your digital camera. I love the underwater pictures it takes.
4,Right on time,My rating reflects the amount of time it took to ship to my address (GOOD). This book was not all that needed but served its purpose.
5,Superb Photography,"This is a very fine collection of non-digitized, unretouched photos of truly free-roaming wild animals found in Montana. Don uses light in his photography better than almost any other wildlife photographer in print and has the patience to get the memorable shots others miss. If you're from Montana or if you've visited our state and gotten a glimpse of what we have to offer, you will enjoy this book. Anyone who thinks photography is not art has not seen Don's photos. We in Troy, MT are lucky in that every couple of years we have the opportunity to see a slide presentation of his best photos from around the country. In addition to being one of the best wildlife photographers in the business, Don is a genuinely nice person."
1,Don't support this photographer,"Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that he is not an advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself."
2,disappointing effort,"what can you say about a CD by two of the greatest house music turntablists ever that contains NO turntable work at all? If you like Rickie Henderson without stealing bases, or John Stockton without an assist, you might like this overly soft, undramatic CD..."
5,MAW Are Ahead Of Their Time!,"These guys have only just begun to jam! Anyone who is a DJ is very likely to own a considerable amount of MAW records. This latest offering only waters your mouth for the 12"" releases. ""Like A Butterfly (You Send Me)"", ""Backfired"", ""Our Time Is Coming"", ""Every Now And Then"" and ""Latin Lover"" are my favorites. Put in the cd and start dancin'!"
5,Can't go wrong with Fela or Roy Ayers,"Apart from the great influences of Fela or Roy, I would get this CD just for the Luis Salinas track..Talk about a deep track."
5,Perfect fit,Used it to replace a 25 year old standard plate. Exactly the same. I looked everywhere before finding this one.
2,"Val Watson, ""Urbal""","Former Club Nouveau frontwoman Valerie Watson dropped this album this year and it is one of the strangest albums ever (although Val herself always acted a little peculiar). She seems to be on some kind of ""funk"" vibe, which is fine but the production is too underwhelming and she tries too hard to be funky on songs like 'Pass the Vibe', 'Do What Come Funky', 'The Real (Do-Do)' (featuring Bootsy Collins) and 'Soul Shack'. Speaking of underwhelming production, even the Jane Eugene (of Loose Ends) guest spot on 'Whether U Know It' doesn't save the song from its dreariness. Val can sing and if she would just focus on that instead of trying to be funky, the results can be lovely like the song, 'Days Like This'. I can't recommend this album to anyone. Just check out Club Nouveau's old stuff if you like Val Watson."
2,"an ""URBAL"" disappointment","When reading the review by Loudmouth, I felt as if I had wrote it because that's exactly how I feel when listening to this cd.I couldn't wait for this cd to be released and before I picked it up, I had heard a few songs on XM radio and I had mixed feelings about what I heard, but decided to give the whole project a chance.After a few listens i'm just not impressed.I think Val is trying so hard to vocally be funky that it gets in the way of the music. I really like the music on Earth, Wind & Fire but for the life of me, I can only make out about 5 words in the song.Maybe i'll keep listening and see if it gets better in time.E."
5,Big help with new baby,"I got this as a shower gift, and it was one of the best gifts I got. I never thought to use the emery boards with a newborn, but they were so much easier and safer than the clippers. The scissors came in very handy as she got older. The rounded tips prevent you from hurting the baby by mistake. A must have for any new baby!"
5,Really enhances the look of my front door!,I love this door knocker! It exceeded my expectations and makes a really stunning statement on the front door. It is heavy and very good quality and truly exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend it!
4,Leatherman Wave is your toolbag without the bag.,"I have owned several leatherman waves since 2000. I was a Communication Specialist in the Army for 8 years and this tool has by far been the most valuble tool ever. At three in the morning with commo lines down in a combat zone for a Medevac unit with nothing but moonlight and my rifle, this has been the tool on my side. Seriously. I have borrowed Gerbers and Swiss and nothing compares to Leatherman for durability and ease of use. The three I have owned one was given as an exchange for breaking a Gerber. The other was stolen (it was in the glovebox of my car that was stolen) and this one. I had bought a cheapie Walmart ""pocket tool"" and it was busted after a few uses. Go with the Leatherman. It should be initial issue for all 25U's."
4,LEATHERMAN,"Great product, didn't anticipate the additional weight from my previous Leatherman. Will require an extra cinch in my belt to hold my pants up."
5,Brilliant product,"Very sturdy, reliable, and useful!It's always with me, whether out hiking/camping, or out for a simple bike ride in the park."
4,Great Tool,I have had Leatherman knives for years. The Wave for my applications is by far the best. The only thing I don't like is the nylon case which is blukly and lakes up a lot of belt space. Give me the option to have a leather case.
4,Good book - other editions available,"What a great book - there are lots of editions available on Amazon, including this brand new, crisply illustrated edition for slightly less:The Splendid Wayfaring: The story of the exploits and adventures of Jedediah Smith and his comrades, the Ashley-Henry men, discoverers and explorers of ... River to the Pacific Ocean, 1822-1831"
2,Maisto Mercedes-Benz G-Class,I wasn't allow the option of color choice(black or silver) and I supposed I can get at least the color shown on the picture(white).Finally I received a yellow one which is the color I hate and I didn't expect a yellow G55!
1,This is only a review,This is a one-page book summary of the more expensive book by this same title - it's not worth $6!
2,Fifth Grade Summer Reading,"Mr. Flanagan is obviously an accomplished journalist and music executive. But a novel needs more than music industry insight and humorous one-liners to succeed. A&R is written in such a predictable, pedestrian style that I often thought I was reading a script for an ABC after school special. Given the nature of the characters and the industry which it depicts, A&R comes off as a tame tale of human ideals vs. the corporate giant, not the insider's view at the belly of the beast that the jacket copy would lead one to believe. Had his writing style actually been compelling and challenging, as opposed to the kind of bland writing that often passes for music journalism, this book would have been much better. In the hands of another writer, A&R could have been excellent."
2,Stick to Television,"It was truly enjoyable subject matter that I'm sure only Bill Flanagan (and any other music industry person) could provide. What I could not get past was his ham-handed writing style that led me to think he started a short story for Rolling Stone and then decided to lengthen it to a novel. But maybe I'm not the right person for this book: I've enjoyed reading my entire life, from the classics to contemporary drivel that continously and surprisingly makes Best-Sellers Lists. If I only read Rolling Stone or music biographies, I'm sure this would be one of the best books I've ever read.I don't, and it wasn't.Pleasant, feel free to buy my used copy."
4,"Get ""Evenings Empire"" too","If you enjoy following the intrigue of the music business, you'll enjoy this book. Bill's later novel ""Evening's Empire"" shows his maturing as a talented writer, but this one is definitely a page turner too. Go for it."
3,"A&R and the ""modern"" music industry","I enjoyed reading this book about a guy who works as an A&R rep for a record company and his life around it. At first he's driven by the love of music, but as he gets promoted it is the buisness ascpect of the job that takes the upper hand over the interest in good music (well, it's not called music business for nothing). This is a great read, although I think three stars is a fair rating as it's a good but not spectacular book. For people that works in the industry or are generally interested in the workings of the music business--pick it up!"
4,"Fun, Eccentric","A decent portrayal of the music industry. Tragic, but reflective of the carefree side of this eccentric business. The music business certainly has evolved (or maybe ""devolved"") culturally. Listening to the radio and seeing the evolution of the new recording stars makes you wonder what's real and what ""they"" want to think is real. Ultimately, the consumer knows what they like; and so we find in A&R."
4,"Entertaining, Revealing Book","""A & R"" is a very entertaining and revealing book about the music industry. We see the corruption that often occurs in the leaders of the company, we see greed, we see everything that can and does occur in the music industry. I highly reocmmend it."
4,Very good!,"This book is not high-level literature, nor does it give some sort of salient ""sneak peek"" at what really goes on behind the scenes in the music industry, but it is a good read. Well-paced, appropriately developed plotlines and subplots make for an entertaining romp through a somewhat fantastical rendition of the music business. The characters, particularly the main character, are likeable and flawed, and all-in-all it's a good book. It won't make you any smarter, but it will entertain you for a couple of hours."
3,"Why don't you like this, baby!?",I thought my baby girl would think this toy is cool - with all the grapes to touch and feel. But nope. Nada. Nothing. She doesn't even give it a second of her time. It's still cute though!
2,So cute but not so entertaining,My daughter is just starting to teeth at 9 months and we've had this since she was 4 months- it's boring...nothing about it makes her want to go near it lol. If it had a rattle she might be sold. I thought it was really cute I bought a bunch of them only to find out she could care less. She likes the Sophie the Giraffe- that's the best.
4,I loved it more than my son did,"I love this product! It is adorable and very safe for our organic baby, but he was never very interested in it. He was never one to put 'everything' in his mouth like they say that babies do. Maybe that is why this wasn't as much of a hit? That is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Maybe your child will like it. I will try it again when we have the next baby. It is soft, made well, and machine washable. I think another reviewer mentioned that they would get a few of the grapes wet and throw it in the freezer for extra teething help."

3,"A delight for beginners,but not for big project lovers","The layout of the book is very easy to follow,with everything categorized,the book in itself is beautiful. The beginner will love it because of its easy,small and bountiful designs and motifs. Definitely not a book for cross-stitchers who love big projects"
5,So many ideas...,"This book has so many patterns to choose from its almost hard to think of things to do with them. It really is a great source for small projects, like baby bibs, hand towles, baby gifts, or little projects for gift giving. I use this book frequentally for begining stitchers who would like to compleat something right now. The images in here are just right to add a little animal, flower or monagram to just about anything."
4,Great source book,"I have often used this book when I am at a loss for a pattern for a gift. I often do small projects, and the patterns are the perfect size. I also know that I can find just about anything in this book."
3,ok designs,"This collection is middle of the road in quality and useability. I don't do ornaments, or little bitty projects, even in a sampler many of these peices feel wrong. I would rather pull from old source books, or even Mary Engelbriet for add ins like these. Some stitchers may find it usefull, but I have never actually used a pattern out of this book."
5,wonderful,"just got it and don't think I'll ever need to buy another book again it had everything catorgorized by themes, just loved it. Best buy I have seen in a very long time."
3,2001 CROSS STITCH DESIGNS,"hI i CANT REVIEW MY BOOK YET AS IT HASN,T ARRIVED AS YETIS THERE ANY WAY OF CHASING IT UPTHANKING YOUROSEMARY HOSKING"
3,Its O.K,"Really small designs and lots of them. I hate all those color backgrounds when they show you the designs, its hard to see what the colors really look like. To much going on. It's. O.K. Save your money."
5,itty bitty pretties,"a girl I work with loaned this book to me because I love anything that has fantasy stuff about it, and this one has a whole page of fairies, dragons, castles even a knight! as well as a bunch of nice things for other projects! and the largest one can't be over 4 inches so they are good for quick little projects! I loved it so much, I had to buy it!"
3,Disappointing for its price and promised number of charts,"If you are starting out, there's no doubt this is a great buy, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed. Each page shows many charts on a chosen theme: 'House & garden', 'Fruits & Berries', 'Santas' etc. The quantity is excellent, but its quite a mix of design quality and style - some highly professional, others rather more basic. It won't please all of the people all of the time, but still a good starting out library resource."
4,Lots of wonderful designs,This book has lovely content with a lot of interesting and useful designs. I found though that there was a lot of Americana in it - not being American there are a lot of patterns that are of no use to me.
4,Pretty funny.,Its a comedy NOT a real gangster flick. Its pretty funny! Jason Mewes did well and Hyung-Rae Shim was hilarious as Harvey Keitel son. Was worth the money spent on the rental.
1,Unwatchable,"This movie is not good. It is unwatchable. I love Jason Mewes. Love Harvey Keitel. But, this movie? I don't get it at all."
1,"I love Harvey, but...","This movie is flat out awful. I could only take about 15 minutes of it before I had to turn it off. Its nature is campy (as you would expect) but the execution of the story is painfully flawed. If you love Harvey Keitel and love comedy movies, give this one a miss."
3,needs to be supplemented with local maps,This book offers good textual information about what one can see along a particular route. But the directions are not sufficient in themselves. Each route recommends the map that should be purchased in order to navigate the route. Not recommended if you are looking for a single book to show you your way around Holland.
3,"Charges, but not when on","This charger only works for me when my Ipod is turned off. If the Ipod is turned on, the charger will automatically turn off.For me, this is an issue, because I want to listen to my ipod AND have it charging if it has no juice. This is especially and issue when driving.But I must say it will charge when off. Somewhat of a positive."
1,Third Times a Charm? No not really.,"I ordered this charger a month ago. Since, they've sent me three chargers all the same, all wrong. They've sent me the shuffle charger three times in a row. Don't waste your money on this product, for a few bucks more you can get a company that will actually send you the right product the first time."
3,Shipping cost too high,"I paid 3.30 for six chargers which couldn't of weighed more than 2 pounds total, and had to pay 38.99 for the shipping, they charged seperately for each item, and then shipped them all in one package. Although they rip you off on shipping it was still cheaper than buying at the store."
3,"works, I think......","This charge seems to take forever and never fully charges my iphone. Maybe I need to drive further, like to California. It works and gives a little juice in a pinch if on red, but my home charger works much better. Probably why I only paid $ 1.99"
2,Its okay,"It doesn't work unless you have proper radio signals, and it doesn't charge. I wasn't impressed. I mean, I still use it while I can. But the sound quality isn't pleasant."
1,CHARGER,I GUESS THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. IT SHIPPED ON TIME AND ALL....BUT THEN I FOUND OUT MY CIGARETTE LIGHTER IN THE CAR DOESNT EVEN WORK! BUMMER!
1,Does not charge iPhone 3G,Beware! This device will not charge the new iPhone 3G. I did not test it with the other devices with which compatibility is claimed.
2,Not so good,This item makes a noise through the stereo when I have it plugged in and have my ipod playing. For sole charging purposes it works well if you are going to have your ipod out of comission during the chargin process
1,Sent wrong item!,I read the reviews about the wrong item being sent and now I am one of those persons writing one. I received a cheap wall charger that had nothing to do with using it in a car.
3,Item purchased,THe speed and efficiency I received this item with was wonderful. I cannot rate the product as it was a gift to one of my children for Valentines Day.
5,The cheaper alternative,"I gawked when I saw the price Apple was charging for their ipod car charger, so when I found this off-brand, I thought I'd give it a shot. Works great, and I didn't break the bank."
3,Ipod Charger,"The charger was what I expected. I ordered one, but received two because the first charger was delivered 5 days after Christmas. I sent back the second charger that I received last week. Delivery was too long."
1,Will not charge 3G iPhones,Sure wish I'd known that before I ordered it and paid for expedited shipping (which I didn't get!). They've updated the product description but I'm guessing only after selling a whole bunch of these and making a little bank on the shipping charges.
1,Beware,"Do not even waste your time with this. I don't even know how this product can be sold. I used it for about 3 days in my car to charge my ipod, and it ended up screwing up my ipod. DON'T BUY IT!"
2,get wut u pay4,"u mite break the charger by pulling the unit from ur phone. the little tabs on the sides r supposed to b pressed in so the charger can release. they broke. cheap crap. the charger does work to charge ur iphone, but otherwise poor product"
1,ipod car chager,one broke the first day used the plug for the lighter hole sprang apart and now one part is missing
3,Worth every penny!,"Bought this charger about a month ago and have used it several times. It works just fine. Standard shipping was pretty fast and so far, I am quite happy with this purchase. Definitely worth giving a try."
1,A Horrible Purchase,"I didn't receive the item pictured. The part I did receive actually makes my 3rd gen. ipod play music garbled after around 30 seconds of playback. The product is junk (whichever product it is that I DID receive), and the company untrustworthy. Don't waste your time or money with either."
1,"cheap price, cheap product",1st one would not work. Cool Vue mirrors would not return calls. Amazon finally became involved and contacted company. I was then able to talk to someone at Cool Vue. They did not want the 1st one returned but sent me another free of charge and it works okay. Will never buy another automotive product online.
1,"Por favor, ahorreselo","El dvd es muy malo tecnicamente, pusieron los canales al reves. Escuchara al publico adelante y el concierto atras. Ademas no es tan bueno como los videos Arriesgare la piel(Emi-Chile) y The best of (CGD-Warner).BAd, bery bad."
4,This CD Contains the Same songs as the Chansons de Films CD,"When I purchased this CD, there were no specific listings of songs on the product details. I thought that this was a different CD from ""Chasons de Films"" CD I had previously ordered. However, I will keep it in case I wear out the first CD as I play this at least 10-12 hours per day. I cannot get enough of this version of ETRE sung by Charles Aznavour. Even though he has sung this song on other CDs, he puts more feeling into this version. This is what makes him the greatest singer ever.I recommend this CD for all of you diehard Aznavour fans out there."
1,Weak!,"Obviously written by a novice! Little connectivity, a jumble of ""I dids"". Try another profession Mr. Dillard."
2,"Good mystery, tiresome sex","Set in 1818 England, Venetia Hamilton is the oldest illegitimate daughter of a famous erotic artist. Since her father's hands are crippled, Venetia now draws and paints the carnal pictures that tantalize society. And she's being blackmailed about it.In order to protect her mother and younger sisters, Venetia cooperates with Marcus Wyndham, the Earl of Trent. He's also being blackmailed about a vicious family secret. The blackmailer is an aging and famous courtesan. Venetia and Marcus attend a country house party/orgy, facing the blackmailer and murder and their own desires.Pretty good story but, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, the sex was too much, too repetitive, too boring. By Chapter Six or so I skimmed the sex passages. I was more interested in the mystery - who killed the blackmailer and is now after the blackmailer's journal?"
3,Hot historical romance,"If you are looking for a book with scorching sex from cover to cover, this is a book for you. I was a bit irritated over the ""period"" slang words used for some bodyparts though. The plot is also a bit hard to swallow. It was also a bit farfetched that the heroine, in all her innocense, is so fast in willing to try everything forbidden. Though I do find her gorgeous and enchanting. It's a good read though, the above mentioned put aside :-)"
2,Yucky slang spoiled it for me.,"I bought this book thinking it would be a little better written than it turned out to be. The book uses a lot of what I can only imagine the author thinks is ""period"" earthy language but was really moronic slang for body parts. Somebody's ""cunny""? Come on. Maybe some people get turned on by that stuff but it is really distracting and irritating in a book about supposedly intelligent and sophisticated people. It just didn't fit. I'm selling my copy ASAP."
5,Perfect for storing earbuds,"I had bought a similar product from Wal-mart (except shaped more like a 3-dimensional hourglass) and discovered to my horror that it was crushing the cables of my favorite earbud headphones because the slots were too tight. Every time I slid the cables in they would get pinched and crushed. So I quit using it and with some trepidation bought this product. Well, this one is made just right. I can slide the cables into the slots and they don't get crushed at all, since the slots are loose enough. So I would highly recommend this product."
4,"Nice Product, But Not What I Need...","The Sumajin Smartwraps are definitely a quality product. Very well made and the shipping/service was first rate.But maybe the Smartwrap is too well-made. It's just a bit too heavy. I bought this with the intent of using it to manage the ear-bud cord for my iPod Nano, which I wear on my arm while working out. If I don't safety-pin the whole shebang to the front of my shirt, it'll bounce all over while I'm running (pulling the buds out of my ears) or get in the way while working with weights. If they integrated an alligator clip or some other method of securing the unit, it'd probably be perfect.So I give the Smartwraps a solid 4 stars for being really good at what they do but knock a star off for not filling my particular need very well."
1,Over priced,The price is too high for what you get. There are many other very similar products for 1/4th the price. This item does nothing special. Don't waste your money. The material they are made from has an unpleasant odor.
4,Nice Design,"Bought these for my girlfriend. Very small and does the job, she only used them but once or twice. Too bad."
3,Smartwraps earphone,"nothing really special, but it works the purpose you want.... $4 for a piece of this plastic wrap, actually sounds $$$ .. my friend made it herself with some thick cardboard paper!!!!"
2,Didn't care for this,"Although it works fine, I didn't care for the results. The center portion is too small for my tastes. I don't like cords wrapped so tightly."
3,Nice Cord Storage,Simple yet effective. If you have a pair of premium earbuds or just want to manage your cord this is a nice item. A tad bit pricey for a glorified piece of plastic though. The same effect could be achived with a paper clip! but it's all about being stylish. The white and black match most iPods.
5,These are great!,"Dealing with my earphones is so much easier now. I love these little cord managers! They are simple as could be, well-made, and make it much more pleasant to listen to my mp3 player."
5,Works great.,"As other reviewers have stated: this looks superficially like the kind of thing you could make yourself, given a craft knife and some rubber. But actually the design is extremely effective and interesting, if subtle. The cord manager is rounded and tapered in such a way that, once clipped in at both ends, the headphone cord tends to stay tightly wrapped regardless of how the cord moves around in your pocket.3 cord managers are included in a package, but it works so well that I just ordered a second set of 3 so that I can use them to organize the rest of the USB cables and other cords that float around in my laptop bag.Also fwiw, the silicone construction and lack of moving/fragile parts makes it seem like this product will last a lifetime. Will be interested to see how it looks after a year or two of use, but seems very durable and it's hard to see how anything other than intentional abuse could damage it..."
4,Worked just as described,These were just what I wanted to help the tangled mess of my earphone cords and at a very reasonable price.
2,It could be 5 stars except...,"I just spent 2 hours making my resume. I tried to transfer it into word because I have to email it along with another word fille to our HR department. Well, now it is a total mess.This program is fine if you are going to print out resumes directly from the program. Horrible for emailing and HTML."
2,Not User Friendly - Brain Dead Editor,"I recently bought this product and found it to be very unfriendly. I was not able to properly save my completed resume. The editor was the most lame editor I have ever used and I have used a lot of different ones in 20 years in the computer biz. I did like the lists of different phrases and so-forth that you could choose from but that's about all I can say for it. The Microsoft Word template has it beat all to pieces for my money.I guess you get what you pay for, and for me that was ten bucks.- Paul B."
4,Really nice!,"The program is really nice. It makes it pretty easy to put together a nice resume and do a web publications and searches. I like everything and I didn't give 5 stars just because I installed this program on one computer, it was crashing right when I was trying to save it. I installed it on to the other computer and ran into the same problem. It's hard to imagine having to bad computers so I do suspect this program has some technical problems. But if you don't foget clicking ""Save"" time to time, you should be ok."
2,Disappointing,Maybe I expected too much after watching BBC's nature videos. It did have some nice visuals but the overall tone seemed to be anti-American. It seemed like they were blaming America for Cuba's wildlife conservation problems but then two minutes later it said that Cubans sneak on the beaches to steal sea turtle eggs to eat them. I'll stick to BBC's videos from now on.
5,Great CD!!!!,"Love all the tracks, very happy and upbeat music. Also, I like the fact that they donate One-third of the artist royalties from the CD's sales to 'CARE' to help feed the hungry children throughout the world."
3,Incomplete,"""In the Eye of Hurricane Andrew"" is a collection of first hand accounts of people who survived the horrible disaster and it's aftermath in South Florida. It is NOT an overall history of the storm, as it doesn't cover what it wrought upon the Gulf Coast after hitting Florida. It is also NOT a compelling narrative history, like the book ""Issac's Strom"" about the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. It is, however, fairly brief at less than 150 pages of narrative and contains only a few black & white photographs.Given the above, I would recommend this book primarily for South Florida victims of the storm as well as to anyone doing research about hurricanes. General readers will not find much of interest here."
3,A DVD which may as well be a VHS tape,"Barney is always great and a big hit with my daughter. However, I would not recommend this particular DVD, if you buy DVD's due to the many wonderful features, such as playing just the songs, skipping adverts and going directly to certain chapters. This DVD has none of these features, so you may as well buy the VHS version. It has some wonderful songs, and is fairly entertaining, however, I would not buy it again, and now make sure that the DVD's I purchase allow us to play just the songs, or select certain chapters. Usually my 17 month old gets bored with the dialogue and wants only to see the songs. If they revamped the DVD, it would probably get 5 stars."
3,Interesting..,"It took a while for my 2.5 yr old to like this DVD. It's more educational for slightly older kids than some of Barney's other works which are simple & musical. There are several familiar songs but the basic concept for this DVD is ""methods of transportation"". Colours are vividly portrayed as well as graphics which is nice to see. Either way your child may like this. Worth a try!"
5,Entertaining with Colorful Characters,"I found this book to be a very charming and entertaining. The characters were colorful and lovable. This was the first Carola Dunn book I had ever read, and I immediately went out and read four more. They were great reads also."
1,Maybe half a star,"I bought the book for karen kelley's story, since I do enjoy reading her work. But these three stories were bad. The first one, with the british sister, the author seemed to use English slang when the hero was speaking and some of his lines sounded decidingly English. The photographer sister wasn't too bad, but since its compared to two not so good stories, it doesn't say much, and I didn't even finish the third, for one thing I didn't like her name Lillie June, it was just all bad. Sorry I may be in the minority here, but I figured I just give my opinion."
2,Trite and unconvincing,"I was quite aggravated that I spent a couple of days of my life reading this novel. At first, the style of the book was quite gripping but after part 1 this pseudo- literary attempt flounders. The characters are described effectively but one never gets to the heart of their personalities. Frankly, several elements of the story are laughable: the Benandanti, the romance of Sweeney and Dylan being just two. As a Goddess worshipper I was not delighted with the overall hostile tone of the novel towards Goddess spirituality; don't fool yourself into thinking this is is a feminist take on Goddess craft. Plus, some of her 'facts' about particular Goddesses are wrong.I would have liked this book more if Hand had not described everyone's outfits and faces in such mind-numbing ways. Many pages of this book leave you bored, bored, bored! Read this if you go more for style over substance."
4,- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -,This was a very good book. I recommend Mists of Avalon though if want a really good tale about Arthur told from women's points of view (Manely Morgaine and Gwen).
5,Great book- you wont put it down,I am not someone who reads novels all too often. A friend gave me this book and told me to check it out. I read the first chapter hesitently and was hooked. Hand does a great job of weaving a wild tale. Just when you think the plot has gone as far as it can go.... Hand takes it a step farther.I could not put the book down
1,Skip it!!!,"Although Ms. Hand's writing style is quite good, I would sugggest passing on this novel. She started out very well, but toward the middle, I had trouble suspending my disbelief. After that, it was all downhill. I couldn't relate to (nor did I even care about) the characters."
2,Waking the Reader,"It started out well (though I would've paid another dollar to get a readable font). But after reading, and reading, and reading ... the payoff wasn't there. After I finished, I still had too many questions. Like what, exactly, were the Benandanti and how did they come about? Too many side plots that meant nothing, like the Minerva lawyer and getting back the artifacts -- what was that all about? And when did Dylan find the missing chunk of the lunula? And how could Sweeney be that braindead not to notice a major cult figure in America? What was that bit about Oliver? This book was just too unfinished. And I grew weary of reading about chthonic blackness ... This book was not erotic -- it wasn't even a very good bodice shredder (which is what it turned in to). Promising beginning, frustrating reading, disappointing ending."
1,Sure cure for insomnia,"Remember that student-published ""literature/poetry"" journal from your college days? Overwrought ""deep"" symbolism, so obvious and clumsy it hurts? Well, if you liked that, you'll LOVE this! I stuck with this book for 100 painful pages hoping that, sooner or later, something would happen that wouldn't have me cringing at the ridiculous situations, unbelievable and unlikeable characters and horrible writing. I should have quit after the first chapter. Skip this one, believe me."
3,Waking the Moon by Elizabeth Hand,"I could identify with the story line of a young girl going off to college her feelings of vulnerability, the emotional experiences linked to meeting other students, followed by a relatively peaceful adult life after graduation. The encounters with the ""moon goddess"" seemed in-credible and unbelievable, Descriptions fell into a repetitive pattern so I skimmed over pages without missing anything in the story. I was looking forward to a powerful ending, but it felt like the story just stopped after another surreal goddess encounter. However, it DID encourage me to do research on Greek and Roman mythology, and the goddess myths."
5,haunting,"I read this book a year ago and can't get it out of my mind--ms. hand has tapped into something very powerful here, and tells a dark, nasty, and very convincingly researched and detailed nightmare about what might happen if the goddess really came back...couldn't put it down."
2,Great plot but cumbersome writing = disappointing,"I had great expectations for this book, as there are so many good reviews out on it. I found it to be very disappointing. The plot was very imaginative and could have been exciting. But the writing was overly verbose without being engaging. I never felt for any of the characters despite the author's obvious attempt to make things feel real. I also was discouraged by some big problems with the narrative - the ending was dramatic, but the consequences of both sides were not explored. In the end, the narrative has convinced the reader that matriarchal-based religion is seductive but evil, but she never explores the consequences or goals of the patriarchal religion and society that the Benandanti defend. By not addressing the world that the Benandanti stand for and by lumping all ancient goddess-based religions into one homogenous blood-hungry cult, the author's epic starts to seem more simplistic than it should, like a soap-opera."
3,"Pretty good, but...","I liked this book the first time....when it was Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned. Only that book had huge philosophical themes that had little to do with gender: beware the pure idea, etc, whereas this book seems a simplistic recasting of Rice's novel purely in terms of recent gender politics and dubious archaeological research. Camille Paglia's work is used in an extremely careless way: the novel seems to be an elaboration on CP's infamous (and calculatedly hyperbolic) statement to the effect that if civilization were left in female hands, we'd still be living in grass huts. The novel leaves behind a sour taste of misogyny despite Hand's device of a 'heroine' saving the world from matriarchy. That said, I thought the book was entertaining and very interesting both for its obviously deep research and its bizarre Patricia Cornwell-esque internal tensions. Hey, if Hubert Selby gave it a blurb, it's worth a look."
1,Tedious,"I wanted to like this book, I really did since the plot idea is wonderful. But, and it's a big but, it's just tedious. A lot of readers loved it, which is fine, but trying to figure out 'who', the mixture of first-person and third-person narrative, was just the start of being tiresome. I did finish it but I had to push myself. Reader beware."
4,Insightful!,"Jol De Rosnay's book is a gold mine of provocative ideas about the evolution of mankind, economics, politics and more. It pulls together information from organic chemistry, computer technology, chaos theory and a slew of unrelated fields to argue for a less egocentric approach to business and government. In the process, it redefines competitiveness and industry. This eloquent presentation is definitely not a light read. It is mind-boggling in scope but fractal in delivery - which means you can delve into virtually any section and get a feel for its message. Business wisdom is spotty here, but this is not a business book. Instead, it's more of a cross between Wired magazine and an intricately researched science fiction novel. It is not for the faint of heart (or brain), but we [...] recommend it, if you'd like to stimulate your mind, shake up your old beliefs, check the inventiveness of bold technological projections, or glimpse an exciting future."
2,Dissapointing,"I was really excited to find this book and read it as I have explored these theories for many years now. However, there is nothing new here. You can read a hundred pages and walk away having felt uninspired, unimpressed and no smarter than when you began. I kept hoping somewhere in this book I would find something that would make it worthwhile, but nothing. Very dissapointed."
4,Microsoft M60-00006 IntelliMouse Explorer for Bluetooth,"Took sometime to ""wake-up"" after booting up.Response not as smooth as logitech mouse"
2,"Too much slippery,just as one of the previous review said.","The mouse is not easy to pick up, you can hardly hold it inyour hand after installing the battery and made it heavier.I would like to return this, but, oh......too many troublesin returning or selling.I also learned a lesson that you always have to try the mouseby yourself rather than ordering it online."
2,Doesn't work with Toshiba Tecra A4 notebood,"Same problem as reviewer B Chan - I have the USB wireless model, not bluetooth, but no response to extra programmable buttons on a Toshiba Tecra A4.Toshiba owners beware!!"
3,"Works OK, wish it was better","This mouse works fine with the bluetooth chip in my Dell computer. I just wish that it had an ""off"" switch to save battery life. I've also found that I need a mouse pad (or something similar) when using it in hotels - it doesn't work well on glass table tops or smooth tables that I often find in hotels."
2,For Toshiba Notebooks - Test Before u Buy,"Good build, feels comfortable and smooth wheel; no clicks - preference thing :)However not ideal for road warriors:1. No on/off switch..2. Dunno about other notebooks, but on a Tecra A4, P750, XP, SP2 with bulit in bluetooth (BT), BT security setting needs to be set to ""low"" (no security provided by bluetooth) before the mouse is recognized; in addition, if the setting is set to any level higher, the mouse will not be recognized again after a reboot. NOT SAFE!In addition even after installation of IP 5.2 software: side scroll wheel and page up/down buttons don't work (maybe conflict with notebook touchpad)It would be good to hear from other Tosh users out there. I am however returning the product."
3,Great usability bad energy saver,"I love the shape of this mouse, the computer's response to it it's good enough and the ergonomical shape it's comfortable enough. What I don't like and became a real problem is the fact that it doesn't have and on/off button and I have a laptop, so two problems happen when I move it with my computer: the batteries keep working and run out, or it would activate my laptop and I would sometimes find it on inside of the case and burning hot, not a good thing at all. I would have to buy batteries for it almost every other month and it became a hassle since it does not tell you it's going to run out of batteries but it just stops responding. On the flip side, my friend has the exact same one but never moves it around and does not have the same problem as I did, so there you go."
2,Nice mouse...awful bluetooth!,"The mouse itself is quite nice...includes a multi-directional scroll wheel.The problem is with the bluetooth software. Microsoft bluetooth mice will only work with Microsoft bluetooth software, and MS bluetooth software isn't very good. It doesn't include a serial port, so forget about hotsyncing your bluetooth PDA through the BT dongle that's included. The MS bluetooth software does not allow you to make use of ICS on Windows XP, which is even more bizarre. In fact, forget about using almost any bluetooth product that's not Microsoft. Typical of Microsoft.Save your money..avoid this mouse. Use another brand of bluetooth mouse...or juse buy an rf mouse and save money. Bluetooth technology is vastly overrated, horribly complex, and frequently incompatible with devices from other companies."
2,After 2 months of use,I looked at others reviews and hoped that it would work for me and it has not. I am on the third set of batteries and I only use it maybe an hour a day. The rest of the time it is in my backpack. Maybe that is causing the drain because it moves around some I don't know but it is crazy to keep feeding this thing batteries. As far as tracking goes it is averge to below. I have the laser mouse from logitech and it will track on any surface that I have thrown at it. This mouse jumps around alot and if the batteries even get slightly used then it will lose signal and you have to uninstall and reinstall it to get it to run again.It fits my hand okay but not the best by far.If you want a mouse to just get you by then maybe buy this one but I personally am definitely getting something else.
4,Good Value,"It's a nice product for the price. Very compact. Good quality video for my purposes.The battery life is a problem. I've been using it to tape portions of my son's baseball games, recording for about 10 seconds at a time and pausing (when he's batting or pitching) and it barely makes it through the game."
2,JVC Everio GZMG57 DIGITEL MEDIA CAMCORDER,"With the camera recording and I turn my body I get a jerking motion on the play back. The biggest complaint I have is the lack of instructions that can be understood on how to do THINGS. Yes, I see a phone number. I can call and I have done this. When you get someone to help you which might be a long wait. They are very polite and explain so I can understand. Why can't they write instructions that can be understood in the first place. JVC is not alone on this subject"
2,Could have been MUCH better.,"The author debunks much of a field that needs debunking. There is a LOT of crap out there. The more egregious examples are really laid low; Tony Robbin's excesses for example. But he totally leaves the reader hanging. He makes no hints as what arre good, scientifically based directions to go to improve ourselves. I would cite, for example, the works of Richard Wiseman."
1,Doubting Education and Self Improvement?,"This guy is amazing- to think he would belittle education, self improvement and good philosophies. Then not only put it down try to instill his negative attitudes on others by writing a book! WOW- They really do walk among us![...]"
1,a lesson...on bitterness,"When people are disillusioned and struggle hopelessly with the loss of ideals that led them on a certain path there are two ways to respond. And perhaps one is really an earlier version of a journey to the other. This road leads from disillusionment to bitterness and matures into wisdom.This book is filled with the bitterness of a true believer overwhelmed by the disillusioning experiences along his path. The bitterness comes out in attacks against the weak...the passive...the feminine...the hopeful...the humble...the ill...the poor. It has the tone of a man who has rejected the religion of his family upbringing...it is argued emotionally.There are two other books that are hidden in this one. The book he would have written when in the sunlight of his ideals, when he was believing the things he is now so bitter about. The second may be written later on his path when he finds the wisdom in the lesson of his current bitterness."
1,Does More Harm Than Good,"A poorly documented book that slams people, is filled with judgment, and does nothing to help others is the foundation of the entire book. Salerno's SHAM does not take into account the millions of people that ARE actually being helped. The book is filled with inconsistancy, poorly argued statements, and is an attack on celebrity, so that he, through this book, can cash in on the celebrity bashing.The whole book is filled with negative gossip, that while reading it, I wondered why I felt so bad? This book did nothing to help me, if anything, it made me feel worse."
2,Sham,The name says it all. The people doing the self help thing sure are screwing the rest of us over
4,An eye-opening book for those entranced by sham artists,"In this book, Salerno unashamedly takes on the ""self-help and actualization movement"" - or ""SHAM"", as the acronym conveniently spells out. The first part of the book includes chapters about Dr. Phil, Tony Robbins, and other self-help celebrities - though curiously not Oprah Winfrey. If you're a fan of any of these celebrities, it's worth reading this book to open your eyes to a different perspective.The second part of the book describes the consequences of these ""sham artists"" at work. However, this is where the book falls down. It often sacrifices rigour and logic in order to rant. Some of the points he makes are reasonable, no doubt, but a less overtly biased approach would have been more convincing."
1,"SHAM = Senseless, Hypocritical, Arrogant, Misguided","Any fool can pull the wool over your eyes, SHAM reads like a sad cry for attention. So called documented proof about the self help industry SHAM winds up being at the top of the heap for the sucker born any minute. The book doesn't measure up to the claims it makes. It instead cries out for a complete re write. The title had promise but the book delivered nothing of substance."
1,Sham is a good title for this book,Salerno deals more in anecdotes than facts. Not a book to be taken seriously.
2,Padded,"The author shares my distaste for the self-help promoters, but sometimes has to stretch his arguments. There is a classic New Yorker piece here, but there is not enough for a book."
3,"Good articles, poor book.","There is no grand ""Oprah Cabal"" conspiracy detailed here, though he takes a few punchdrunk swipes at it. Needs another couple years of work and this could be a good book!For better versions, check ""The Guru Papers"" or ""Madame Blavatsky's Baboon"". I give 3 stars just because there is some good stuff in there, but you gotta dredge."
2,Little scholarship here,"Several of the other reviewers cite Salerno's ""arguments"". And that is largely what we have here. Not a serious fact/theory- based study, but an extended journalistic article, shoehorning a wide diversity of 'teachers' to align with the author's two - scarcely original - central conceptual slants: empowerment and victimization. There is scarcely any discussion of the core ideas propounded by various self-help practitioners; scarcely any reference to evidence of the validity or - likely - invalidity of these teachings, their relationship to established psychological theories, or indeed the content of what is taught. Instead, we get a scattering of scornful examples of language used by people such as Tony Robbins, Dr. Phil, Dr. Laura, etc. and anecdotes discrediting their pasts. In the case of Tony Robbins, we get a criticism of his spelling.There's an important job to be done in analyzing what's going on in the self-help movement. This book does not do it.Dick Westwood"
2,Like a talk radio host in book form,"* Sloppy writing (""Beg the question"" should not be used to mean ""prompt the question"", for one).* Shallow, inept analysis.* Suggests all self-help books are inherently worthless. No treatment of the idea that one might actually benefit from some (any?) of the self-help literature.* It is as if he hasn't actually read any of the books, just flipped through them to the bullet points.* Wild overextension from self-help to a wide range of societal problems with no data at all to back it up.* Overall, an unconsidered book on a topic which demands a more serious and careful treatment."
4,Entertaingly Nostologic,"This game is a true period piece. Not really something which will take hours of your time, but it is something which you will appreciate just because it is so silly. It is a great way to remember the early 90's"
3,okay toy,very durable. my son uses it for a step stool more than he plays it. we had to remove the sticks cause the string was too short.but it has been good for a little fun for my son. 25$ is a little high.
2,horribly out of tune!,I can't play one simple song with my daughter on this thing!holy moly it is out of tune! When I read other reviews I thought please it's a baby xylophone how out of tune could it be? Get it and you'll find out! And the hilarious thing is that it even has a slot for holding music sheets! WHAT!?
1,Terribly out of tune,"I am a professional musician, so I might be overly sensitive to these things, but this keyboard is completely out of tune. I don't mean ""it's not tuned exactly to A 440 concert pitch"" I mean the notes are not in tune with each other. If you follow the ""sheet music"" included in this you get a minor rather than a major ""Row, row, row your boat"" and a ""Twinkle Twinkle"" with a minor sixth instead of a major one. It's nice that they attempt to have a complete octave, but if all you have are eight notes they'd better be the eight notes of the major scale!Not usable in my opinion.I can't speak to the durability or other usability issues mentioned in other reviews because we didn't even take it out of the box and are sending it back."
3,Not the most durable item,"I bought this for my daughter about a month ago. She is a year old and has managed to rip off one of the mallets and break one of the keys to the piano part. She isn't really rough, this toy just isn't made for consistent play. She does love to play with it and still plays with it often. I just don't think that this toy will survive till xmas."
1,Xylophone frustrating,"We bought the caterpillar version and while the piano part is cute, the xylophone the very, very frustrating for my 3 and 1 1/2 year olds. I realize the strings are short to prevent them from getting wrapped around their necks, but these are so short that even if I hold the mallet perfectly, I can barely reach the end bars. For a toddler, who doesn't always hold the mallet the correct way, this toy is very frustrating.Even if you hold it just right to reach the furthest note, the head of the mallet is so huge that it hits the sides of the instrument and the note sounds dull and not pretty at all.This toy causes more frustration than pleasure."
1,Pathetic excuse for a music DVD,"I have seen many music DVDs in my time, but this is one of the worst. Let's get one thing straight -- I love Larry Coryell. He's a great guitarist. But this DVD is horrible. First of all it's not a live performance -- it's a series of partially baked practice sessions recorded with poor sound quality (volume constantly changes, and sometimes disappears completely!)in front of a handful of unidentified people. The band often seems to be playing the song for the first time. The filming is so amateurish that it's sometime laughable -- reminds me of home movies. The camera constantly jerks around, when the trumpet player is doing a solo, the camera is showing you the drummer, when Coryell is doing a solo, the camera is focusing on flecks of dandruff on the back of his coat. I play guitar, and I wanted to watch his fingerwork, but you won't catch anything here. This DVD is junk and the other reviews I read in here had to be written by the DVD maker."
1,Very Poor Indeed,"I have to agree with the other 1 star review. Yes Larry is a wonderful guitarist, that goes without saying, but this is a horrible dvd. No need to repeat everything the other 1 star reviewer said other than I agree with every word. What were you thinking Larry?? And he sings here!!?? I have at least 10 of his cd's and I have never heard him sing. Thank goodness too because as wonderful a guitarist as he is, he is just that poor a singer. Anyone remember Roy Buchanon?? Well Larry isn't quite that bad but very close. What a bummer. Don't waste your money."
3,it wasn't delever,i actually didn't recive the DVD's because our custom in my country take it away because of the nude picture on the coverso sad
4,"Edited for TV version, but good entertainment.","I purchased this DVD with the (mistaken) understanding that the contents were the original, unedited versions of the episodes. I viewed ""The Human Operators"" episode a number of years ago in Canada, and the disk version has clearly been censored. One can easily view these edited episodes on IMDB or Hulu for free. So, buyer beware!"
5,Wonderful Sexuality,"I saw a couple of episodes on TV. They still have reruns on the ""Outer Limits"". My favorite one is the ""flower child"". She's a beautiful killer! This makes it all that EXCITING!!!"
5,Science Experiments as Object Lessons,"This book uses a great variety of scientific experiments to illustrate Christian concepts to elementary-aged children. The science is solid and the lessons are far from ""fluff"". All experiments were tested carefully before inclusion."
4,Portrait of a young woman as artist,"Baring My Soul delivers on its namesake. Like the ethereal essence of its author bound in book pages, this collection of Mrs. Tolbert's poetry welcomes you into her world of solace in words with the prelude ""Lyrically Swimming"". Through the sea of her language we swim into her life and its many facets, from the stress of being a working mother of multiple children in a busy work-a-day world, to the truths hidden between the lines of behavioral facade at family gatherings. It is a literary slice of her life, and it runs the full gamut of emotions. In the storm of more morose or angry poems there are repreives, hilarious interludes that satirize the last presidential election and politics in general.With wit that is never condescending and a pen that is never compromising, Stacey Tolbert has the beginnings of a lucrative career in poetry compilations here. Lets hope she doesn't hold out on us for too long with a sequel."
2,Peerless Tilt Wall Mount for TV,"I had an older 27"" tube TV that I wanted to mount in our guest house. I would not recommend this mount for larger TV's, probably nothing above a 20"". The arm that mounts to the wall seems stable and sturdy enough, but the platform that attaches to the arm is very wobbly. I have used other brands in the past and they are much more stable. I cannot recommend Peerless unless you are mounting a small CRT TV."
5,Works great and very durable,This bracket is very strong.I use it every day at work with a 15 inch point of sale system that's about 40+lbs.Very sturdy and easy to adjust.It can be attached to just one stud.
1,Would be helpful to have all the right pieces,Wrong nuts and bolts we're included.. Inless you wanna go to ace hardwere . Other than that it somewhat works
5,"Readable, brilliant, soulful","Bias: I am a believing Catholic and a fan of the Pope, a fan of faith, hope, charity and love!While I am regularly wowed by the profound depth of our Holy Father's writing (and speeches), so much that I can usually only go through a few pages per day in most of the former Cardinal Ratzinger's writing, Deus Caritas Est, which is directed to a wide audience, read pretty easily (two days). This is not to say that it is not profound or worth taking time to contemplate. It is a beautiful treatise on love, and the expression of love.One of many ideas I will take from this is about love in charity. When we serve in charity, we are not somehow superior to they whom we serve. We are inseparable from them.Very recommended!"
5,Great Message to the world,"This is a must read book. Easy to understand, and very direct to the point. If you want the real meaning of Love, you should read this book."
3,Church Activities,"This book by Pope Benedict should be recommended to every Christian, to go straight to the horse's mouth, THE Pope, and just go to even cheaper, obscure sources. The church is no joke. In England, Marilyn Manson would probably get treason and hung by the Prime Minister. For me as a born again Christian, ELCA, I was just so sick of everyone jumping on the Manson bandwagon years later after he was an old man and retired. Bible bashers need to wake up- Satanists are still fighting for their own credibility and are way behind. This is not just blind faith I'm talking about, I'm talking about being a member of a local church and being saved- the dark side of Christianity."
2,Not as I thought it would be.,I ordered this book for my grandchildren. The age it is stated to be intended for is not appropriate. The words are confusing and way above the learning stage of the intended age group.
5,Toddler Wants This Read To Her Nonstop,My daughter loves this book. Since before she was a year old she would select this book out of a pile to have it read to her. She will run around the house hunting this book and then want it read over and over.
5,Great book for beginning reader,I remember reading this book when I was a child and loved it! My son is in 1st grade and is a little slow at reading. He could read this book and he loved it. It is not too long for him to read so he doesn't lose interest. We think Morris the Moose is fun and entertaining!
3,Not nearly as funny as the other Morris Books. The others are great.,"This book is ok for a basic reader, but we bought it becuase the other Morris books are so funny for children. I highly recommend checking them out. If you're looking for humor, I would skip this one. Again, not bad though as an early reader."
2,nonstick coating comes off quite easily,I like the product with the exception of the nonstick coating. Pieces of it came off on the food the first time I used it. When I cleaned it more came off.
3,Decent rack,This is a sturdy rack with larger gauge metal then many similar racks. It's fairly heavy duty. But the non-stick coating started coming off with the first hand washing. I may just strip it and season this like a piece of cast iron.
3,Doesn't fit one of the items it's recommended for...,"I purchased this rack along with the 18 inch Graniteware Oval Roasting pan. The rack looks like it is very nice but will not fit into the oval pan. If you want to use this rack, you should select a rectangular roaster - it's the curve of the oval that makes it not fit. I checked the dimensions, but didn't calculate for the curve (and just accepted what was recommended as a good idea)."
2,cheap coating,"Used it once to roast a turkey in a roaster , went to hand wash it and the non-stick coating started to come off . Would have given it one star except it is very sturdy"
1,non-stick comes off,Bought this and by the 3rd time - the non-stick stuff started coming off.you get what you pay for
2,scratchy,"I bought both this sheet and the knit ones for my daughter's delta portable crib. I have thrown this one out as it shrunk, is very scratchy, and gives my daughter a rash every time. If you have a portable crib, get the knit sheets"
2,Case does NOT fit the 80 gig 5.5 video ipod,"I would love this case-it's sleek, sturdy looking, with a nice, clear protective cover, well designed.But it DOESN""T fit the 80 gig ipod, as is clearly stated in the product description. Now I have the hassle of making a return. Too bad.If you have a smaller video ipod, I'd recommend the case."
5,Good Mic,"I use this in videography, mainly for interviews in noisy environments. The directionality is a plus.I've also recently used this with a Tascam DP-008 digital recorder with excellent results."
2,Great Mic just doesn't work well with the Canon t2i,"This is a great mic, but doesn't work well with the Canon T2i. The T2i has some preamp issues that don't produce a good sound for this mic. I tried it on a friend of mines camera that is a much better camera, forgive me that I can't recall its name, but the Azden worked great on his. It's a wonderful mic, just not for the Canon t2i"
1,It didn't work for me.,"I bought this to use with my Canon 7D, using an XLR adapter that I had.The volume was way too low, making it worse than the built-in mic and essentially useless. I sent it back."
3,A Couple of Winners on this CD -- But Painfully Lacking too,"There are a couple of good songs on this CD. The group does in fact meld rock with country to some degree, but the problem is that the musicians lack the talent of other groups that have successfully done it in the past, such as the Eagles, and more recently the sound of Son Volt. A couple of the songs are catchy, but the lyrics are absolutely anemic.If you want a good country/folk/rock blend of music, check out Son Volt. They put it together with lyrics and much more musical talent. Just my opinion."
4,pretty good little camera...,"other than the lens distorts slightly, which is bad for me since I use it to document paintings, which are square. My picture frames always have curved edges with this camera. The picture quality is great and the camera is easy to use and cutely small. If you are over 50, make sure you have your glasses handy to read the really fine print!"
5,Good one,"I actually bought two of this camera. I got one as a gift for my family first and had to get another one for myself. It got all the feature you want, both closely zoom and wide angle. Battery life lasts reasonably long. I can go for a day trip without recharging. Memory card is definitly too small. Recommend buy extra. You might have to be a little patience when processinging picture from camera to printer but i don't think it's any easier with other camera. It's probably not for a professional photogarpher but for everybody else, I think it's perfect."
3,Great Product - Annoying Fan,Cisco products are always great. This product was for home office use and the fan is a bit loud in a smaller office. If you don't mind white noise it is alright but if you need quite this product is not for you. It is not like an airplane taking off but you do notice it.
2,Great when working,"My company used this router for just over a year. It worked great and then stopped transferring data abruptly with no apparent cause. There was a lifetime guarantee on it so they are replacing it at no cost except that we have to ship in the broken one. It does leave me without access for several of my users, though, for the next week to 10 days. It's worth mentioning that the as soon as I mentioned the model number to the customer service rep he guessed the problem. He said that he hears this model number all the time and its for the same problem. The bad thing is that they are replacing it with the same model. Hope this doesn't become a regular thing."
2,Not expected to be,This guyver movie have lots of action and great fighting scenes but it's not what you would expect this guyver movies is not dubbed in English. I wish it could be in English. It's annoying to me because I don't understand what they are saying and usually I spent my time reading the english sub - titled then looking at the picture. So if you hate English sub-- titles don't by this movie.
5,THE CREATION of HEALTH,"For me the first thing to have a good health is understanding oneself, and create a plan base on spiritual, psychological and emotion."
3,Interesting? Yes. Believable? Maybe.,"While Myss and Shealy's book is interesting and thought provoking in that it introduces novel information regarding the mind-body connection, it lacks the scientific support that would make it entirely believable. Though the book's credibility is enhanced by the fact that Shealy is a medical doctor, there are far too many statements throughout that leave the reader wondering where the information came from and if it is backed by any research studies. Many valid points and theories are presented, however, they tend to be mixed in with very subjective and unsupported material. I would suggest that this book be used as a basic guideline for the current discourse about the connection between emotional, spiritual, and physical health, but that any information be further researched by consulting scholarly works in order to ensure its legitimacy."
1,Shrinks! Does NOT fit standard cradle mattress,"This sheet is junk, it shrank the first time it was washed. If you could get it to fit onto your cradle mattress, the edges would curl up and not stay on properly. My advice.. spend more than $6.99 and find a sheet that fits correctly and would meet safety standards."
1,Are YOU rich?,"This book annoyed me as it is for people with plenty of money to throw at an architecturally designed, no holds barred, studio space. How many artists have this kind of money? As has been said too, it offers no practical advice for measuring, designing or actually setting up the actual studio.Waste of time buying this unless you just want to look at pretty photos of idyllic conditions."
2,underwhelmed,"There was less of this book than I expected. Just pretty photos, no solid advice. Most important, no measurements!"
2,Ceramic Better Homes & Gardens,"This is a pretty book, but not too useful, unless you have unlimited money to spend on your studio. Features gorgeous designer spaces but little practical help if you need to set up a studio within space or budget limitations. It's house porn for potters."
3,"Good, but there's better","Meh. Some of the instrumentals are very solid, but the vocal pieces were disappointing. Fiddle a bit prominent for my taste - I wanted more banjo and mandolin. Overall the album feels a bit slickly produced and, well, too *fancy* for a proper bluegrass album. If you want a great bluegrass Christmas, stick with Dan Crary's Holiday Guitar, or ""Tinsel Tunes"" from Sugar Hill Records if you are feeling punchy."
4,Good Product,"Could have a little more intensity, but has one of the best sound activated features i have used. Very good product, has a nice look and does what it is supposed to. It really stands out when you put some fog in-front of it!"
3,"No, it's not Edwin L. Porter's Day at the Circus","The pictured VHS tape is Alphabet Factory at The Circus, which is a 23- minute children's documentary made in 1995 picturing many aspects of a traveling circus: tigers, elephants, clowns, trapeze artists, and more. For its intended audience of small children, it is perfectly decent and educational entertainment.Despite Amazon's label, what this film is not is Edwin L. Porter's pioneer silent film documentary from 1901. Film historians beware!"
1,"WAS the best mustard ever, until they changed formula & ruined it for gluten free people!","I have bad news for all you Nances lovers like me. Nances has now changed the formula. They made it gluten free and it is disgusting!!! I accidentally bought a bottle and had to throw it out. I emailed them and asked, they are not making the original formula anymore. Anyone who is upset about this should go to [...]. Click ""retail"" and ""consumer feedback""! I did get an email response and they said that this is there new formula but they will take in to consideration customer feedback! We must get our old nances back!"
1,Nance's Has Committed Suicide,"This used to be an amazing and unique mustard. But recently, they changed the formula so drastically that this tastes NOTHING like the original ""Sharp and Creamy"" mustard that has had so many fans for so many years. It tastes terrible. And it's just plain wrong that the label bills it as their ""original zesty smooth blend"". It's not."
2,Best mustard ever!,Great mustard! have been eating it for over 50 years and have had it shipped to me all over the world while I served in the United States Air Force and ever since. Great stuff!I now must change my review.....I have loved Nance's Sharp & Creamy mustard since the 1950s and had it shipped to me all over the world throughout my Air Force career and for 35 years since my retirement. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with the last case I received. The new formula has lost that taste that made Nance's so special!
4,Stable and attractive TV wall mount,"I bought this TV Wall Mount for a small dorm room (9 x 12). It was quite simple to install but it definitely requires two persons. Also borrow or buy the right equipment: a Stud Finder (installing into a wooden stud is essential), electric drill, and a socket wrench with a stand-off extension ( driving a 2"" square head screw into a wall stud takes some effort). Once installed, it feels very stable and swings out and pivots smoothly.Pro: quick installation, attractive, easily adjusted, sturdyCon: need the right tools/a little know-how/extra person, no channel to hold wires"
3,Great Series! Lousy Mastering...,"I purchased my favorite Outer Limits episodes on VHS a couple of years ago before they were released on DVD. I am still impressed with the high quality of these first season television shows. The original ideas, great writing and top-notch acting make this my favorite TV sci-fi series.I would have eagerly bought the DVD version so I could enjoy the superior picture, sound and convenience. Unfortunately the decision makers chose to place these programs on double-sided disks which are quite inconvenient. It would have made much more sense to use dual-layer DVDs. I have a Pioneer F727 300+1 carousel DVD player. It would be quite annoying to have to take out each DVD, turn it over and replace it to see all the programming.I don't understand why anyone would think that consumers prefer double-sided DVDs to dual layer..."
3,Volume three had errors coding errors.,"I have a Dell PC with a three giga hertz processor and 1.5 giga bytes of RAM. When I played either the epsisode ""Invisibles"" or the episode ""Second Chance"" the first parts of each episode on that DVD are badly coded. They freeze PowerDVD and then when other parts of the episode are selected it works fine.I find it very irritating."
2,Bad audio transfers ruin impact of great series,"For a series in which dialogue, sound effects, and music are as important as the visual aspects, it's unpardonable that MGM/UA has degraded the original sound quality on these DVD transfers. As opposed to the reasonably bright and clear sound quality available on previous VHS and laserdisc releases, what we get here is sound so compressed, dull, and distorted that it makes these great episodes a trial to get through. I didn't find the video quality all that bad, but I'm still relieved that I didn't give up my four volumes on laserdisc.My low rating is certainly not for the series itself, which ranks as one of the greatest ever. It's just me expressing my frustration over the irresponsible transfer of perfectly fine source material."
1,Poor DVC Copy,"I also have been having problems with this DVD and I have also tried it on multiple players. So far I've only played one of the DVDs and two of the episodes are nearly impossible to watch. Problems include: scenes hang, scene jumps back to the begining. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT."
5,Maybe its the player but my DVDs are great!,"I can see that some people have had problems with their disks but I've got to say that I love this collection and have noticed no artifacts of any kind (my DVD player is a Toshiba). My old Samsung would have choked on them as it did on other disks. When I returned the Samsung and got the Toshiba, all of my disks that used to skip or drop out played error free.My rating of the DVDs is excellent. I have waited a long time to get these shows (I used to watch them when they were first on and this is TV as it should be). As soon as the second season is ready I will be first in line to get it.One bone to pick---I do agree with the reviewer who remarked that it was strictly bare bones. There is nothing but the programs here and if any DVD in my collection cries out for extras and documentation, this is it. That aside, the programs by themselves rate 5 stars with me.Joseph Stefano PLEASE!!! get involved with the Season Two collection."
4,Outer Limits DVD Review,The DVD was received in a timely manner but the cover had a chunk taken out of it on one of the corners. It would have made an embarrassing gift.
5,Finally the Outer Limits comes to DVD!,"Although they didn't have the greatest special effects the stories presented in this show still have an impact today. My personal favorite is ""The Hundred Days of the Dragon"" I've been waiting FOREVER for this show to come to DVD. I just hope that the quality is good and that it has some actual bonus Material. I'd like to see the original TV spots for this show. The new series produced by showtime [is very bad]. This is the only outer limits worth viewing. But all in all I'm glad it's coming on DVD. Now if only they would release the DVD's of the original Star Wars trilogy..."
4,Classic series.,"The Outer Limits series are a worthy addition to your DVD collection! A few ""dud"" episodes are contained in the series in my humble opinion but 90 per cent of the series is wonderful. After watching this series it makes you think about some of the contempory science fiction movies and tv shows that have borrowed ideas from these classic episodes. Pioneering Stuff! A great box set to own along with season 2, (only 2 original series were made) very enjoyable."
3,Watch out for poor or unplayable DVD's in the set,"I love Outer Limits, however I have to echo what another reviewer wrote...watch out for bad DVD's in this set! One side of the first DVD in my set either would not play or the picture and sound were out of sync with dropped video in parts.These disk are VERY sensitive to scratches. Even the smallest scratch on any of these disks and you will have playback problems.Has to do with the type of disks MGMUA choose for this set. Not as reflective as some other better quality DVD disks, so your DVD player will have a hard time reading these disks if there is even the slightest defect (scratch, smudge, etc)."
4,Still Scary,"This series was the best of its kind. Shown in original black and white, the stories were great morality tales of the times, as many of the stories dealt with Cold War fears. The music is still as creepy and scary as ever. A major motion picture should have been made of this series, as was done with The Twilight Zone."
4,ONE SMALL PROBLEM,The set is reviewed well elsewhere . I do feel that i have to comment on the packaging though. It is shocking! There are no notes. 4 discs that have nothing written on them and no internal packaging at all. A wasted opportunity as the content of the shows is superb.Let's hope season two gets far more reverential treatment...
3,"HIGH CONCEPT SHOWS, LOW EXECUTION DVDS","Some wonderful sci-fi TV episodes get a good ol' hi-tech thrashing by MGM here. They had all the time in the world to create a top of the line product, but seem to have put little thought and effort into this collection. Tis' a pity. However, there is still plenty of enjoyment to be had here, and considering the modest price tag, I heartily reccomend it."
1,"Terrible video quality, [inexpensive] packaging","MGM didn't lift a finger to try to provide an acceptable level of video quality in this turkey. Granted that the original film recordings are ""worn"" to say the least, MGM could at least have done something to minimize the embarrassingly high level of video noise. As far as the packaging is concerned, MGM might just as well have included a square of sandpaper with the instruction ""scratch me!"" The plastic lip around each disk rubs agains the adjacent disk when the package is opened/closed. As those of us who know the truth behind the lie of the ""durablity"" of CD/DVD technology, the slightest scratch renders these disks unplayable. If you like the original Outer Limits series, and have any eye for quality, and don't want to pay a lot of money for disks that will become scratched beyond repair after only a few viewings, don't order this product from anyone who wants to seperate you from your hard-earned bucks."
4,wait for a better release,"It is the best of TV nostalgia, but this DVD set doesn't do it justice. I'm waiting for a COMPLETE release of all the episodes with BETTER AUDIO QUALITY."
2,"Poor Quality, Stories Sadly Dated","Like other reviewers here, I have had trouble viewing two of the episodes because of technical problems due to bad quality disks. Also, I am sorry to say that the scary, excitingly creative episodes I remember seeing when I was a small child now seem outdated, with many of the scripts and/or acting coming off as clumsy and corny. One episode stands out though: ""Forms of Things Unknown,"" despite its pat ending, seems like an avant-garde Italian film with a lyrical, poetic kind of creepiness. Rent before you buy would be my advice."
2,Where are the rest ???,Where are the rest of this fantastic series???? they've missed the best one off this which was 'Demon with a glass hand' I've been searching everywhere for this for years :(
1,Shame on you UA,"I can not recommend this set at all, which is a terrible shame.I love The Outer Limits but the Disk quality and mastering make this set totally useless.I have tried this set on two different DVD Players and my computer and the sound will not stay in sync on any of them.There is nothing more irritating or angering than to spend this much money on something you really love and have it ruined by the penny pinching of the studios.If you can handle watching the mouths move and then a second or two later hear the word they spoke, then you might be able to watch this. But it is too jarring for me.Shame on you UA- this was not a bargain bin set"
5,outer limits -the original series dvd,"I received my dvd set of The Outer Limits -The original series for Christmas and I have played at least 3 episodes from each dvd already. It was great to sit back and watch those shows that I used to watch as a kid. I never remembered watching ""The Special One"" until now when I saw the alien reveal his ""gills"", then I had a flashback to when I was 10 years old ! Some shows that I did remember were the ""Zanti Misfits"", ""Tourist Attraction"",""Fun and Games"", and ""The Invisibles"". None of the discs had any skips or problems with the picture, I did notice that I had to turn the sound up a little higher than normal but I really don't consider that a problem because the sound was clear. I was very pleased with the dvd set and am waiting for the second season to be released !"
4,60 year old still loves black & white TV,"I loved ""Outer Limits"" when it was first on TV in the early 60's. I've watched repeatedly any reruns whenever possible, so I decided I should just get my own DVDs. These old B/W series are inoffensive (there's no blood and gore) and nostalgic. 32 episodes of intrigue; simple, great ideas and stories. After all the special effects of today's films, the simplicity of the makeup and scenery is refreshing. If you ever liked stories from Outer Limits, One Step Beyond and Twilight Zone, you'll love these DVDs. Finally some simple story lines I can follow!"
1,Poor portrait of an outstanding Cuisine,"I grew up in a Gujarati household. Unfortunately for me I never learned how to cook and so I was looking for a nice Gujarati cookbook to serve as a guide. Now I knew that nothing would be spot on, my mother being an amazing cook. I thought that I could perhaps use a book like this as a guide. Unfortunately as one other reviewer wrote, this book is very limmited in the range of recipes it offers. But far worse than that is that the recipes seem almost alien to me. So many of the classic Gujarati dishes are not present. There is a high abundance of recipes that do not even look gujarati, recipes that have been collected elsewhere. I really do not recommend this book if you are looking for a useful cookbook on creating Gujarati dishes."
5,In Touch Series. the Discovering You Identity In Christ,"Charles Stanley has a Baptist Church of about 15,000 people. He has written many books. His books about study series are very good, some of the best I've seen. You might not agree with everything, but these are good."
2,Good for light loads,"This product was purchased to function as a primary closet....Bad idea. While I'm sure this is great for storing a few clothes in the attic/basement, it's not sturdy enough to handle a full wardrobe. The legs of this closet ended up buckling under the weight of all my roommates clothes an fell over in a twisted heap of metal. ...And the cover was a pain in the butt, we ended up getting rid of it."
1,Don't buy it.,"The wardrobe came with all one-way bases when it was supposed to come with 2 two-way bases. Wardrobe cannot be assembled without 2 two-way bases. Also, it came with thin pieces of cardboard that are supposed to go at the bottom and top of the wardrobe. Cardboard deteriorates and is easily bent. I am returning this item."
2,Not strong enough,"It didn't take long after we set this up in my mom's garage and filled it (about 3/4ths full) with normal-weight shirts and dresses before one the bars broke and the whole thing collapsed. Now we have (1) no place to put the clothes, and (2) a big mess to pick up!! It's a great size and idea for keeping clothes clean (zippered, etc.) but we're thinking maybe it's too big (long) for the size of bars used. Anyway, it's one more thing for the garbage and more work for us. Nix on another one!"
4,Reads Like a Prairie Fire!,"Girl-On-Fire is a quick-paced, exciting, well-researched book that'll make you stay inside reading on a beautiful Spring day! As personal (you feel you KNOW Carrie)and in-depth in the folkways of the pioneers as the ""Little House on the Prairie"" books, but with unexpected insights into Comanche lives and culture as well. A terrific story depicting the conflict of two cultures and the rare bridges that individuals can forge in spite of these differences. I found the end so wrenching, I couldn't imagine how Carrie could stand to make her decision!"
5,Fascinating,Michah Nathan writes in a style that gives the reader a clear picture of the settings and characters. The writing style makes you believe that you are really there. The use of Latin throughout was fascinating and is not a skill that is easily used. The history of alchemy was also intriguing. The story could easily be made into an interesting movie.
1,The Great Anticlimax,"Gods of Aberdeen starts out with an intruiging plot (search for the Philosopher's stone) and an interesting protagonist (orphan from both the country AND the big bad city). Unfortunately, Nathan never fully fleshes out any of the threads of story that he begins. None of the questions the reader asks are ever answered satisfactorily, least of all the question, ""Is there a philosopher's stone?"""
4,No Ordinary Thriller,"I don't normally read thrillers, so when a friend of mine recommended Gods of Aberdeen, I started reading the book warily--and could not stop turning the pages. This is no ordinary thriller. Set in the rarefied and gothic atmosphere of an exclusive New England college, this is the story of an untimely death, as well as of a young man's journey of self-discovery. Nathan's considerable powers of description allow the reader into the high pressure world of Aberdeen and its mysterious academic cabal, but also into the inner life of Eric Dunne, a sixteen-year-old prodigy who, while researching medeival history, learns much about fear, mortality, and the darkest corners of the human heart."
1,Useless Product,"I bought this jack to play songs from my iPhone in the car. It didnt sound anything like music; I was doubtful of the phone/car stereo, but I had the same result from my other mp3 player as well. Then I tried getting another jack and its been fine ever since. This is a completely uselss product, tho its priced low, the quality of the make more than reflects the fact. I assumed since sudio jacks are so simple, this should be fine. I was wrong by a large margin. I'd strongly recommend buying other good jacks (of reliable brands). I didn't even return this since paying for postage might not make it worth returning!"
2,Cheap one with low quality,"When I received it I pluged it in my car cd without problem, however, I found it very difficult to plug it into my mp3 player. It worked only after I tried to plug it in in different angles. And obviously it has something to do with its manufacture quality. I guess I just got what I've paid for."
4,You won't be able to put this one down!,"""No More Fear"" offers a first-hand account of what happened early in Cambodia during Pol Pot's murderous regime. Physa's story is so gripping that I found it impossible to put the book down. The author does a good job of conveying the message of hope, faith and trust in God in this book."
5,Music for the soul: piano and voice,"Rarely music touch the soul. Wim Mertens is able to produce such a thing and surely the miracle will repeat for every one who loves piano and voice. Be prepared for a great experience. With so few elements you'll be surprised how many feelings to discover inside yourself. Five star, no doubt."
1,Rusted in 2 months.. Stainless has new definition..,"It was OK at the first look - little cheapy look on the lid and handle, though.But after 30 days, it has begun to have little stain on the edge of pot and after another 30 days, it is rusted here and there and I missed the return date.Not recommended."
3,Not so sturdy,Bought this as one of the gifts that I gave my sister for Christmas. They are great cooks. I was really quite disappointed at the quality as the one I had purchased a year earlier from a local store was so much better. My sister said not to worry and that she would just keep it. Will be interested to see if they still have it when I next see her.
3,Radar Detector,I was disappointed initially that the battery option did not work. That was reason I bought it so I would not have a cable hanging from windshield. I ended up mounting it on dashboard (actually more unobtrusive that even a wireless mountinbg on windshield)and it works pretty well. Detects every type of radar currently out there so I kept it rather than returning.
4,good book,needed it got it on time but had to drop the class. anybody looking for this book il sell cheaper ... contact
4,Required textbook,The product was shipped in a timely manor and was received as described. The context is written in a way that can actually be understood and provides clear descriptions and explanations.
1,Stop Butchering Beatles Music,"If you want to hear Beatles tunes performed very poorly, then this is the CD for you. However, for the rest of us, this CD should be avoided. It will make you angry and disgusted.Beatles music was never intended to be elevator MUZACK. Well, this is exactly what you have with this CD -- atrocious moog and flamingo guitars horribly arranged. After listening to this nonsense, I got the feeling that the performers intended to make a mockery of the Beatles music right from the start.If John were alive today, he would never approve of such a butchering to his music. This is 24 tracks of unpleasent noise. Personally, I think that Paul, George, Ringo, and Yoko-san should sue these dorks on this CD for making a total mockery of the Beatles legend."
2,Worse than the previous one,"This DVD is made with new kids that are green. It's definitely worse than the previous one, ""Night Before Christmas."""
5,Debbie Allen - Webdeb.Com - Internet Source for Anti-aging,Discover the benefits of the Q2 Water Energy Spa through Dr Peiper's book. Learn how YOU can Re-Charge YOUR battery!
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought 2 of them for my Mac Minis: one for home and one for work. Unfortunately, the scroll down button broke 4 months later on both mice. I take great care of my belongings and keep my computer equipment clean and in a dust-free environment. Macally products are usually great and the mouse itself is fine if it wasn't for this glitch."
4,Good Buy,"I recently bought this mini-mouse, and so far I have been pleased with its working ability. It doesn't require a mousepad, and it works best for me on paper. Its really light and easy to tote around. Very much worth the money I paid."
2,Just too small,"This mouse is just too small. I ordered it for my new mac mini, but the size makes it uncomfortable to use. The mouse is of fine quality, and works fine, but I don't like it. Before you order, understand that it is half the size of a normal mouse."
5,my mouse of choice for 10 years.,"The MacAlly iOpti Jr. mini optical mouse is the best mouse I've ever used. I'm about to order my third in at least ten years. It's a compact, 3 button optical mouse with scroll-wheel. the scroll-wheel is the third (middle) button. I actually rarely if ever use the scroll-wheel button, but it's there and sometimes useful. I've used a lot of different types of input device over the years - tablets, roller-balls and mice. I prefer this mouse to all other methods, probably just because it's the most intuitive and responsive I've used. I have short, stubby fingers too - I think that's why this mouse feels the best for my hand. I do wish it were more programmable - other devices I've used in the past have had many programming options for the buttons - but while convenient, those options aren't deal-breakers for me. What matters most to me is how it feels in my hand and how well it lets me interact with pixels."
3,"Portability A+, but...","It's small, light, portable, and it tracks and scrolls just fine(scroll wheel a bit squeeky). But it's too small and light to be a ""daily driver"" for me, and I don't have big hands. But ""feel"" is entirely subjective -- it's inexpensive enough to give it a try and possibly fail if your looking for a little mouse to carry around with you or have REALLY small hands."
2,romantic sound,"This has a ""romantic sound"" and I was looking for something more relaxing. If your looking for something more relaxing, I'd recommend ""Passages"" by Mike Wall."
4,Transport Chair,"Received faster than expected! I thought I had waited too long & had borrowed a scooter to attend a planned event. Sorry, I haven't used the chair but it appears to be adequate."
4,"For the money, this is really good.","I had purchased another transport chair for $100, but had to take it back because I could not handle the 25 lb weight. This one cost more, but is so much easier for me to handle getting in & out of the car. It's comfortable for my mom, keeps her off her feet & is pretty easy to maneuver. On mine, the back brake isn't much of a brake, so I would say be careful with trusting it completely. If it wasn't for that, I would give it 5 stars. It's easier to get my mother out of the house now since because of this mobility."
3,Very dissatisfied with Medline on their Service,"I received the product in a timely basis, but it was shipped from Medline and I received a packing list for someone else with their information on the packing list. When Medline was contacted as to where my contact information was, their Help Desk replied via E-mail that I didn't have anything to worry about. Probably not the best way to do business. If you can get beyond the lack of proper controls in the handling of their business, the product seems good."
3,New model not as pictured,"Things to be aware of when ordering this chair... The burgundy chair I ordered was not the one that was pictured. If you click on 'red', a blue one will appear. That is the new style; the handles stick out at about a 35 degree angle (awkward) and on the box it is described as EXTRA WIDE, which it is! I got the color I ordered, but many other things were different. There is a big gap between the back and the seat; you will need something like a lumbar cushion to make the chair comfortable. The chair, with the footrests, weighs 24 lbs, not 14.8 lbs. Be aware that if yours is coming from Wheelchairs Plus, they charge a 25% restocking fee if you decide to return it. Return shipping is at your expense; for me it was about $25. I wish I would have known all of this before ordering this chair. Be careful if your product is coming from an outside vendor."
4,We are happy with this chair,"Medline Freedom Chair, RedI bought this chair a couple of months ago for my mom. It's a very good chair for its price. It's comfortable and light. I recommend it."
4,"Portable, good quality; not robust enough for rough roads",Overall this didn't disappoint me. It fits nicely in my sedan's (toyota avalon) trunk along with my kid's stroller. It's light weight and has good quality parts.The only negative is the vibrations on a rough road may be too inconvenient to rider. Also this cannot take any small hiccup on the road and has the potential risk of the person falling over - due to its small size of tires. So we should be very cautionary about such stuff on pavement. I think this is what you are trading to get portability.
1,Kindle Edition is a Losing Bet,I borrowed this book through the kindle library to see if I would like it enough to buy it; I am glad that I did not buy it because all the pages were viewed sideways no matter which way I turned my kindle. I WISH I COULD HAVE READ IT!
5,Earn $12-$24 Each Hour Playing Craps.,"I have tried this system and it really works,coupled with his lessons on charting the tables you can make some money using his system."
1,Not the right book for me.,The book teaches on how to safely play at the table. Your goals for that night should be bigger than $24 an hour. To be that safe in betting the game of craps will not be fun.
2,Old Bugs Character,These cartoons feature the old version of bugs bunny from the 1940s.I gave it 2 stars since I don't like this incarnation of Bugs.I don't know exactly when they transformed Bugs into the more familiar version which to me was his best incarnation. Probably in the 1950s sometime.Jeff Marzano
5,This is adorable!,I bought this as a gift for my niece because she LOVES the color purple! It is really a very TINY flask but the inside being stainless steel and being the perfect color makes this a great gift! If you need a SMALL liquid container to take places and love the color purple.... this is for you! I know she will love it for taking to work every day!
4,"Tasty, especially the orange ones.","These are pretty good little gummies. Suprisingly sweet. They do get hard after about 20 days, so don't order more than you need.Great, tasty product."
2,Seemed a little old.,"I ordered several bags of Haribo gummy clown fish expecting soft and flavorful candy, but received gummi candy that was harder than what I could get in the bulk candy bins at the local store. Very disappointed. They seemed old and not fresh."
1,WARNING! Crippling anti-smoking bias!,"Despite the prim ""research volume""-type title, this is nothing more than an extensive anti-smoking screed with a scattering of simplistic information about tobacco and smoking. This severe bias unfortunately renders the book almost utterly worthless, and those looking for factual, unbiased, and useful information about smoking and tobacco are recommended to search for a copy of the out-of-print Tobacco Encyclopedia by Voges."
4,"Gripping, devious and interesting","I read The Money Stones in one go. It's not a difficult book to read and although some of the characters are manipulated by the author to achieve his aim, I believe that the story flows very well and it's twists and turns, crosses and double crosses are handled in a very expert manner. One would almost think that the author has personal experience of such shenanigans. The story is about a confidence trick, somewhere along the lines of Jeffery Archer's Not a Penny More Not a Penny Less, with the exception that the story unfolds not out of revenge but out of greed. I enjoyed reading this book very much and if you're looking for a book that is entertaining and written in an easy style then this is the book for you."
3,Difficult to install,"I used this product to mount a 20"" Sony TV. When I first attempted to install it I found that the plastic brushings did not fit into the metal wall bracket. I also found the alignment of the screw holes that hold the adjustment arm for different size televisions to be off and I had to use a hammer to put the screw in place. That said, the customer service department answered my call immediately and quickly shipped me two replacement brushings which fit the bracket."
1,Premium Price - Poor Craftsmanship,"Wherein this was a quality filter for my Nikon 18-200 lens, after two weeks, the glass fell out of the rim. Just fell out while changing filters. What was an important component to my photography, and camera protection, is now an expensive piece of trash. As a replacement, I went with a different brand. I guess when the packaging says, ""professional filter series,"" it means that ""professionals"" have enough money to purchase replacements when their equipment goes prematurely south. I can only hope my filter was a fluke and Quantaray does not have serious quality control issues. But like I said, it was a nice filter when it was in one piece."
4,Just fine for the average user,"I don't know much about optics, however, these binoculars do the job. They do not lose their focus after being bounced around and they are compact enough to be carried for long distance without discomfort.I did not give this product 5 stars because I know so little about optics."
4,Excellent value for the money,"These binoculars give an excellent value for the money ($25.99 plus shipping as of 08/23/2011). The build quality is only okay (made in China like everything else these days), but their very small size and light weight make them ideal for watching sport games (Since I received them from amazon.com, I used them several times watching professional baseball games). Optics are really good, with clear and sharp views. Because of the moderate 7x magnification, there is absolutely no shaky image problems. Overall I'm pleased with these binoculars. I recommend these for anyone who needs a good pair of binoculars for watching sport games, hiking, or birding."
4,Nice little binocular,"Was cautious as to the quality because of the low price but it seems to be well built. Easy to see through, clear bright view. Small size makes it easy to carry in wife's purse for me. It was packaged well and was shipped quickly. Only thing they could add would be a strap attachment point on both sides of the binocular instead of one side only. Would recommend to a friend."
3,Opps. Wrrong size,"Ordered this and after receiving it discovered it was the wrong size for our rig. As always, Amazon accepted this back with no problem. The product it's self was good for the purpose intended but I was unable to use it as it was to small for a city water inlet for my RV."
5,Bluegrass Mozart!,"This is one of the most creative CD's I have ever heard.It's Mozarts livliest melodies played on Bluegrass instruments!Country Fiddle, Banjo, Guitar, Mandolin, Bass, Pedal Steel Guitar and Harmonica.It's amazing!The booklet shows 66 ways to develop childrens natural creativity and has great activities for parents and teachers to keep kids busy with activities that bring out kids creativity.This book and CD are a rare combination and DO make kids more creative.It's working on my kids, and with 66 activities I never run out of new and interesting things for them to do.Most of these activities are truly creative. I have never seen them anywhere else.Tony Delphi"
3,Really not that good in my opinion.,"I bought these because I imagined they would be like Cola-flavored sour patch kids. Soft, chewy, sour, & delicious. Oh what a dream come true that would have been :)But sadly, thats all it will remain for me. A dream...You see, as soon as I took my first bite I knew I had made a mistake.This gummy is too difficult to chew... In fact, it reminds me of a poorly cooked stake. By the time you swollow a bite all the flavor has been lost...No one likes chewing tough steak, because it's like chewing meat flavored bubble-gum. Only, instead of spitting it out in the end, you swollow it. Well in this case you have a similar issue. Once you're tired of chewing it, you just wanna spit it out. Why bother with the extra calories?What I mean is, halfway through chewing- the flavor & sourness is lost and so is the willpower for me to eat the rest..."
2,Fizzy Cola,"Not crazy about these at all. I don't mind the ""sour"" taste, but a little too much for me. Like the regular cola bottles better."
4,good... to a limit,nothing wrong with this item... matter of fact its really tasty... my only problem is that i cant finish a bag with out feeling like i need to get my teeth get checked for cavities... i recommend you split a bag to multiple sittings or share with a friend
5,Yummy,Addictive sweet and sour sugar treat but nicely not too sour. Was great for a mobil snack while hiking in the mountains and buying in gross from Amazon was alot cheaper than the camp store.
4,Yummy,"After about the first bag, I got a stomach ache, but I definitely love the fizziness as well as the cola flavor."
4,"Very Good, But ... A Drag","After being disappointed with new Ad-Aware 2007 (not ready yet for prime time), I searched for other anti-spyware applications and found Zone Alarm highly rated. But .... after installation, I noticed that boot-up time doubled, as well as shut down. Getting on the computer is now very sloooooooow. Frustrating. Ad-Aware was never like this. So, be forewarned. If Zone Labs could fix this resource-hog issue, the product would easily make 5 stars. Four stars is toward the quality of protection only."
4,A for content - B for index - C for Binding,"Finally, a resource that offers an unbiased, independent view of senior living facilities in the Bay Area. Thanks for the hours of hard work put in researching and writing. Content is great. The one problem with the book is the binding - I've never seen a book where the pages falls apart so easily ! And within the first few days of very gentle use! I've had to tape about 30 or so pages back. No big deal, considering there really isn't any substitute for the book, and it's a gem. Kudos to the Gilbert family for the whole idea of putting together a resource book like this. This book is now out of print, and as far as I know, the Gilbert Guide has been bought by another company. Hopefully they'll continue the good work."
5,So much fun!,"I absolutely love this book. My daughter got her American Girl doll from Santa last Christmas, and she keeps asking for outfits for her. At $25 per outfit on average, it will get too expensive so soon. I found this book on a different website that offers a snapshot and description of each outfit, but of course the book is cheaper on Amazon.I have some experience in sewing, so the outfits are a breeze to make in just a few hours. They all turn out looking very professional, fit the doll quite well, and my daughter is very very excited. She is only 5, but by watching me make them she is getting interested in sewing herself. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an 18-inch doll and some familiarity with sewing."
4,Review of pattern book for American Girl Fashions,"I liked the different patterns in this book but they do need adjustments as far as the fit. They are somewhat different than the patterns at the fabric store with some different ideas for sweaters but it does lack directions for a inexperienced sewer. Its a guide and does have some nice sweater patterns for knitting. I am glad I bought it and would recommend it if you have a business going, otherwise, just stick to the patterns in the stores."
5,great book,I really like the style of the clothes They are like teen`s fashions They are easy to follow pattern instructions
4,Doll Clothes Patterns,My wife is happy with the product. She had seen it in the local library and wanted the patterns.
3,Good Ideas but no patterns,This book has some good ideas but there are no patterns besides for an ice skating outfit. Still a good buy but would like to see a universal pattern or something in back of book.
3,Making Us Think,"When I was first diagnosed with hepatitis C, there weren't any books written on the subject. Eventually some came out, and although Matthew Dolan's book wasn't the first to be published, it was the first to tackle the subject in a new way. Dolan discussed the virus itself while exploring both Western and non-Western treatment options. He also discussed lifestyle issues, such as diet, exercise, and stress-reduction. The book is mostly out-dated now, having been replaced by a flood of newer ones. However, Dolan's book will always have a special place in my heart and some of his message remains relevant today."
3,donated to the public library......,donated to the public library...............Numbers and You: A Numerology Guide for Everyday Living......hoping others will enjoy this book also....I read a lot of books this one was good but not great!~
5,This is probably the definitive book on numerology!!!,"This book can help you answer many questions about your life, such as, what is my best day of the week? What are the best times of the year for me to start new projects? What is my real mission in life? What challenges will I face in life, and how can I overcome them? what are the best foods for me to eat to sustain optimum efficiency. Life is a sport, and like in any sport timming can make all the difference in the world!!! Before you go to a new place check the travel section to see if your destination will pose new challenges or cradle you in it's bosom. ""Number's And You"" will show you the way!!! Open your imagination to new insights with Mr.Strayhorn's landmark tome in numerology!!!"
4,Great beginners guide,"This is a wonderful reference for people who are just getting into numerology. It is very easy to read, offers exercises to learn the basic required skills, and has enough information to keep it interesting! You can easily do a complete reading simply with the information contained in this book."
3,It's ok,It can tell you a lot about yourself. I would gave it was a gift to someone. Lloyd Strayhorn is great at this.
4,Numbers Game,"The book has some interesting info, but could really use an edit. Simple explanations are often missing, while other portions are excessively wordy. His real focus is the day of the month you were born. He should have started with that info and added in the other stuff later. As it is, I went thru a series of calculations only to find that the most important number for me, 4, I didn't have to calculate. I've known it since I've known my birthday. The book was a fun read, but don't take it or life too seriously."
5,Great for beginners,"I came across this book years ago, when I saw the author promoting his book on morning television. It stated a life intrigue with numerology. This book is great for beginners and lays out the meaning of the numbers and some simple ways to make calculations. interesting, easy to grasp and engaging. A good book if you are starting out and just want some of the basics. In fact, I still use some of his methods and interpretations."
4,Great resource for any agent or investor,"It won't answer every possible question, but it answers the most important ones like:-Does this apply to me?-Is there a way to pay less taxes in Situation A?-What are the tax implications of buying/selling/renting?It's a handbook so you don't need to read front to back, just hit the sections of interest. I kept mine around to refer to and FOR tax time. I had some complex questions about calculating partial years' ownership for selling multiple personal residences within 2 years and it gave me everything I needed to arrange a tax plan. Always double checked w/accountant, but good to go.Getting smart on taxes is the #1 way to improve your investment returns on real estate. This book is worth the investment."
5,HE'S DONE IT AGAIN!!!!,"Chris has once again his best book ever. Jack, Ethan, Toni, and Ashley have to get back to there own time before they are captured. The only way to get back is to get inside the time machine. Which is in the Omega base. They decide that the only way to get inside the maximum security dome is to allow yourself to get captured. Brilliant, right? Except if Ashley sneaks in to free them. Now, Ashley has to be captured too or the Omegas will suspect a rescue mission. Too bad she can't be in two places at once. Or can she. Reread what happens in #2 Alien Blood to see how she survives the ice. GREAT BOOK!!"
3,the rare novel that is inferior to the cinematic equivalent,"It's a good story, but it's basically a skeleton of what would become Robert Altman's kaleidoscopic adaptation, filled with blink and you'll miss it cameos and references Tolkin's novel feels too heavy and it also lacks the humor present in the film. If you want to read some great Michael Tolkin, go to his sophomore novel, the powerful 'Against the Air', or his wonderful ""L.A. Yuppie"" trilogy of screenplays."
2,I could put it down,"This novel is tiresome, overwritten and shoddy. It makes that mediocre movie of the same name look like a work of genius.For what it's worth, the most entertaining part of the novel is watching Griffin Mill lie. It's amusing, not laugh out-loud funny. The book becomes tiresome because the writer clearly hasn't thought out the story very well (Tolkin writes screenplays; screenwriters make bad novelists. I wonder how much Robert Altman contributed to his Oscar-nominated screenplay which is nothing like this trash).If you want a book to make you annoyed, buy this."
3,Description is missing details,It's a good piece but they don't tell you that its very thin. I thought it would be a bit thicker. Also it's very sticky. Other than that it's just a little over priced.
4,FUNKY SONG!,"A Brilliant song by a British band, nice one lads!! Can't help dancing to this funky song!!"
2,Teaching with kids,I bought this with the intention of using it for elementary school aged children. There are not a lot of ideas that are on their level. This is more for adults.
2,Not what I was looking for.,I was searching for sermons to give to kids during the Church service. Unfortunately these are not designed that way. They require too much participation and time than allowed beside even the space to act out these stories. Furthermore I wish they were listed by theme or time of the year. Will most likely return.
1,very dissapointinig,"This must have been written very early in His ministry. He repeatedly uses the phrase ""Ask [invite receive etc.] Jesus into your heart""(p.7,10,11,12,13,17,24...) On p. 38, for example: ""The first step you must take is to take Jesus, not into your mouth, but into your heart..."" Then Ryrie quotes Revelation 3:20... ""If you... who are not saved will open your hearts and take this Bread of life, you will receive eternal life."" Ryrie knows better! A person, child or adult, is saved by faith in Christ (John 3:16, Romans 4:5, Ephesians 2:8-9), Not by asking Jesus into your heart! Occasionally, Ryrie does state that salvation is by faith, or 'trusting Christ' p.43, (p. 34...""simply believe""). You may find some of his illustrations on Christian living helpful, But I would recommend this book ONLY to those who have a good understanding of the Gospel."
1,A load of hooey...,....and pseudoscholarship dressed up as historical research. There is not a drop of real research in this book. Just a lot of selective culling from likeminded and existing sources to construct a thesis.
1,Unscholarly junk,"I'm a half African-American woman and this book isn't worth it. Save your money on real scholarship. Sorry, thats just my opinion."
1,really pathetic,"WHY OH WHY do we make romantic images out of what the ancient egyptians actually accomplished? Grossly and highly exagerated claims about them are taught as FACT in area schools and Mr. Poe seems to be adding fuel to this fire. We leave in a society that takes the word of journalists and actors over people trained in their respective fields. it truly is pathetic. we need to stop believing that the ancient Egyptians speak with this magical voice that we have forgotten. Because as far as hard evidence can tell us, they didn't. I mean, in 6,000 years they couldn't figure out the importance of the brain!!!They picked it out through the nose when you were embalmed because they didn't feel it was worth anything. For the record, I'm from Memphis Egypt and I have blue eyes."
1,"Proof of the gullibility of desperate ""Afrocentrics""","If I want to read a book on ancient history, I want a book written by a trained historian and archaeologist. If the book makes claims on language and race, a trained linguist and ethnologist is minimum to requirements.Richard Poe is a *journalist*, with no training in anything other than pathetic sensationalism - a skill he uses here to rake in the bucks with his ridiculous ""thesis"". What's sad is that in *any* other subject, a journalist would be laughed off stage if he put forward contentious issues on an academic subject with no evidence or training, yet here we are with deluded fools cheering him on! Says more about them and their desperation to believe *anything* than it does about Poe who cleverly, is making money off of their idiocy. Hmm, any publishers out there fancy commissioning me to write a book on how Africans were the first to land on the Moon?"
1,Proof is in the Pudding?,"Here we go again -history subjectively redone. But the proof is indeed in the pudding for instance The Germans build Mercedes and the Italians build Ferraris, but can anyone show me a wheel from Africa please! And this nonsense that Egypt was black not Semitic is quite silly - the black in Egypt were slaves and yes some Semitics do have wooly hair -- so does Jacky Mason so what!"
5,If Not Black Then What Color Then?,"This Is a good book and recardless of afrocentrism or not.I think the preocupation with race Is a modern thing, not ancient.One thing that we must face Is that the ancient eygptians were not europeans."
1,New York Post Fodder,"Ignorant trash from a tabloid journalist. Not Out of Africa. by, historian Mary Leffkowitz remains the final word on the subject."
5,I love these,"We, like many others reviewing this item, have not seen these in stores recently and i really wanted them again. They really are the best at cleaning anything. They also do not have a sponge in them which makes them super clean for a longer time as well. These are great and i will not have to buy these for a long while b/c there are so many of them (24) in a box."
1,These are not worth even one star!,These are not like the ones we use to buy. They are thin and flimsy. I had to scrunch it up and put a rubber band around it to even get it to be of any use. I will try to put two of them together to have a least one that is halfway useful. If I were SOS I would be ashamed to put my name on them. The old ones were so good and these are total crap!!!!! I would not advise anyone to buy them. the worst part is I bought a pack of 24.
4,Tuffy Dishwashing Pad,"I find that these are the best scrubbers for most kitchen clean-up. Unlike regular S.O.S. pads these are made of plastic and do not scratch pans. I was unable to find them in stores so I got them from Amazon. Great little product. My only criticism is that you have to be a bit careful so they don't unravel. They last a long time and are simple to clean in the dishwasher, if necessary."
1,Returned due to terrible quality,"Like some of the other recent reviews, the quality of these blue scrubbies is terrible. I returned this item to Amazon as they are virtually unusable. I can't imagine these would last through more than one or two dish washes. Purchase them if you don't believe it or think that we are being overly critical (which is what I thought prior to ordering)... but be prepared to return them once you see for yourself. They may look like what you expect them to based on the pictures, but the reality is that they are not up to any reasonable standards for this type of product."
4,Blue different from red,"The blue S.O.S. Tuffy Dishwashing Pad is NOT the same as the older red/orange type. The older orange Tuffy weighs .35 oz (new and without paperboard tag) and the new blue is .3 oz. (10g. versus 9g.). The older orange one has larger nylon ""threads"" and is loosely woven. The blue one is more compact and the nylon strands are thinner. Like many reviewers, I prefer the older orange ones; they last longer."
1,Don't waste your money on Tuffy's!!,"I have used Tuffy's for over 30 years,and they used to be the best thing for scrubbing dishes, and were totally indestructable, as well. But their durability has been going downhill for at least the past 5 years. Now these blue ones are so pathetic, they fall apart in just a few days!!! I have bought 2 in the last month, and they are both ready to be thrown away!! Sad that a great product has been ruined. I guess Clorox wasn't making enough money on them when they never wore out! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!"
2,Don't Buy These,"I tried to order the original red and yellow Tuffies, but they're out, maybe permanently. These blue ones are bogus; they are flimsy. You may as well buy whatever scrubbers they're selling at the grocery. Another fine product bites the dust."
2,New Blue Tuffy much lower quality,"Beware the new blue Tuffys. I just tried to buy the usual red and yellow Tuffy and all they had was this new blue one. I could tell as soon as I picked it up off the shelf that it was a crappy, cheap version of what used to be a decent product. I have gone out of my way to pay more money for the yellow and red Tuffy's because the cheaper copies just didn't last as long, or feel as good in my hand.The manufacturer is insulting me by thinking that I won't notice the much lesser quality of this blue Tuffy. It is thinner and losely connected. I expect it to fall apart very quickly."
3,Call the Company,"I called The Clorox Company (the number is on the cardboard tag on each Tuffy) to complain about the disappointing quality of the new Tuffy pads. The man said they ""never"" get any complaints about this product. So all you people who are unhappy with the quality, give Clorox a call. Maybe it will help."
1,poor quality,I read such positive reviews about these scrubbers. so i went out and bought 2 of them. came home torn off the yellow tabby thing. and the damn scrubber came un raffled . it was tied together by a cheap peace of string. I couldn't believe what had just happened. You would think they would have tied it together with the same material it's made of ? Poor quality
2,Disappointment,"I tried these out based on the unanimous 5-star reviews and since they seemed similar to some other scrubbing sponges I've used, but was sorely disappointed. I tried using these pads for regular dishwashing, but they're really tough on hands, don't lather the soap very well, and are overall awkward to use. They may be useful for scrubbing baked-on food from pots and pans, but I never got to try that. I ended up giving the rest of the box away."
5,Simple and simply superb!,"Tough and durable, the Tuffy doesn't unravel or wear out. It doesn't scratch pans or dishes and is easy to rinse out and clean after use. Use steel wool products (or sandpaper) for caked-on foods and burned-on stains; use the the incredible Tuffy dishwashing pad for everything else."
2,NOT FOR LEOPARD/SNOW LEOPARD USERS!,"This is a fantastic piece of gear if you're running the following:1. Windows. Driver issues sound like they've been resolved. There are many bad reviews on the unit due to early problems here.2. Mac OSX Tiger.If you plan to run this on Leopard or Snow Leopard, be aware that there is an issue with the new Apple Firewire Audio driver that will cause you to get clicks and pops in your audio like crazy. These operating systems have been out for years, and there is still no fix from Mackie or from Apple. Both companies want to blame the other, and you know what that means- this is never going to get fixed. I bought one of these 9 months ago and have tried literally everything under the sun to fix the issues. I've rolled back the firewire driver to 2.01. Then to 1.2.2, which was the driver under Tiger OS 10.4. Nothing works, and I'm finally giving up and selling it to a Windows user."
2,Too Specific,"This work was not completely awful. It was, however, overly focused on one lesser aspect of the life of an otherwise fascinating American character. Though this is what the author apparently set out to accomplish, it doesn't make for the most thrilling read."
1,Outdoor Fan,"The fan works well, but we bought it with the idea that mist would cool us down during those really hot summer days in Texas. Unfortunately, the mist is more like a shower. There is no water adjustment on the fan and adjusting the water at the faucet does not seem to help the ""shower"" effect. The fan is heavy and would do best in a place where it is really close to a faucet and does not have to be moved. This might be perfect in a backyard pool setting. We tried to use it on our large front porch and had to move it from porch to storage every time we used it. It now sites in our attic."
5,Yallop impresses again!!!!!,"Brilliant!Not just a well written account of one mans search for a ""terrorist extraordinaire""but a pretty good insight into the middle east conflict.Readable , fast paced , intelligent and compelling."
1,False Advertised,This book was not advertised as being used. yet is has dirty marks and stains on the pages. I will not buy books from here anymore.
3,Good book - manufactured murderer,"The great Carlos wasn't really all that great we discover, but was largely a myth of the US Intel community. An interesting mystery that obviously cannot be confirmed on many points, but since my interest is largely Middle East terrorism, etc. I find their first-hand views of Carlos and terrorism interesting enough to buy the book again just to get their take on the whole affair. Haven't read anything else by Yallop but he does a splendid job here. The tough rating shouldn't indicate whether the book is worth buying (It is), but my tough stand on books that are truly significant in their fields. I read about a book every two days to one week so make tough evaluations!"
4,Good for a pack 'n play sheet,"This is a good ""bed away from home"" sheet. It fit well and did not pop off. I rated it 4 stars because I would prefer to be able to get flannel sheets, but this one is fine for a regular cotton sheet."
5,Wonderful noodles,I used to buy these a t Albertsons and our store closed last year. They are the BEST egg noodles for BBq pork noodles. I make my own BBQ pork noodle dish at home. It was well worth the S&h to have these again. I got great customer service from Amazon and they were shipped FAST from the company in Seattle.
2,Pay attention to shipping price!!!!,"LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!! I was charged 5.99 shipping. Once I realized this (a minute later) I could not cancel my order. I already thought 3.50 was too much for a pound of dried noodles. If you're making lo mein, go buy fresh pasta from the grocery store, or ask your local Chinese restaurant if they'd sell you some noodles."
4,The importance of correct clinical supervision,"The Essentials of Clinical Supervision is easy to read and offers clinical advice on the practice. It clearly explains the necessary requirements of the superviser in various settings from educational to private practive. After reading this book, I feel ready to supervise practicing therapists.The author also provides continuing education hours for the reading of this book and the passing of a test. It is well worth the money."
4,Easy read!,Great book to read and learn from. Very easy and understandable. Review if experienced supervisor. Recommend for novice.
2,USELESS AS EBOOK,"While this book is informative, interesting and easy to read, it is rather useless as an ebook with DRM. Yet another example of the industry's foolish obsession with protecting ebooks to the point of making them obsolete. This book contains numerous helpful worksheets for guiding supervisees. However, since it is impossible to print the worksheets from an ebook, and it is impossible to convert the ebook to a pdf file for printing, this book is completely useless for a supervisor. I would recommend purchasing the hard copy version of the book. Or purchasing a book without DRM."
1,Where are the Artists,I can make a one hit wonder that would blow this away. I would also put the original artist in there so people can know who it is. Not doing that is rediculous!!!
1,Do not buy this,The tracks are not performed by the original artists and are poor quality: don't buy this.
1,Too overpriced.,"Another overpriced cartoons. This must not be a hot seller but at this price, only the county, college or university library can afford this. I need a Federal Grant if I need to purchase this so that I can give a proper review."
4,Finally!,"So happy to see Guy Kyser return to music after taking about 10 years off...Mummydogs are different than Thin White Rope, more low key and bluesy. Love the way Guy and Jo's voices blend, that somewhat makes up for having no Roger Kunkel dueling guitars! Speaking of cover versions, the Mummydogs seem to have struck gold by having their cover version of Johnny Thunders' ""Ask Me No Questions"" used in a Las Vegas tourism commercial. I keep hearing it during Dodger games-- irony?"
4,Re: To upgrade or not,"In all fairness, it should be noted that MS postponed native graphics card support in the initial release of VPC v7. If you look at the Display Control Panel, you should see that VPC is still emulating an S3 Trio. They were under pressure to get G5 support out the door as quickly as possible and postponed some of the planned enhancements. I believe that native graphics card support is due in an update sometime in early 2005."
1,No Windows 98 support,"Beware...this ""upgrade"" drops support for anything less than Windows 2000. The system requirements mainly pertain to the Mac side of things and even Microsoft's site simply states that a ""licensed copy of Windows"" is required. Well, my copy of Windows 98 is licensed but doesn't work. Others have apparently migrated Win98SE but I had no such luck and met with disaster (thank gooodness for backups). So...It's great that it works on my G5, but unfortunately its useless unless I go out and buy WinXP or 2000 and go through the pain of migrating my PC info."
5,excellent product,"These sour strings are very good. The flavors are green apple, strawberry, and blue raspberry. I bought them at a local gas station and got hooked. Haribo usually makes good products, and these are definitely worth trying."
5,Great!,"This was exactly what I wanted. It arrived in great condition, and the candy was delicious. No staleness or opened bags."
4,Fun & Yummy,My daughter & I loved it! For the sweet & sour taste lovers this is an excellent choice. Fun to play with too.
3,Good product but needs padding,"I never leave home without it. However,it would have been better if it had some padding."
3,"Great cushioning, but not quite sticky enough","I bought this mat for ashtanga yoga. It's very well made, and a good mat for that type of yoga, with one exception. The ridges on the top of the mat that aid in traction run the length of the mat. There's no criss-cross pattern that might help with traction. Once my hands or feet get sweaty, they start slipping and I have to add a towel. I've used this mat for about a year, and thought maybe that's just how it was going to be. I recently bought aManduka 85-Inch Yoga Mat (Black), and it doesn't have this problem. In my opinion, the manduka is definitely worth the extra $20."
5,Terrific western flavor!,"If you like true western music (not necessarily country music), then you'll like this CD, and this artist. The writing is thoughtful, emotional, and quite original. The quality of the music and voice is outstanding. I'm always looking for new artists to add to my music collection, and this discovery was pleasant, indeed. I liken the music to something Michael Martin Murphey would do, but the voice quality is much richer. I look forward to more from Jon!"
3,The last days of the German Army.,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't think this book was a great read. The stories are unique, no doubt. However bringing them together leads to a disjoint and is not smooth. One story talked about the Western Front, then the next dealt with the Eastern Front. There was even a story in there from a Russian soldier. I tried to interpret these stories into some theme, but the only thing I got was the disorganized nature of the German Army. The last story from a Waffen SS recruit bordered on unbelieveable, and some of the interpretation mention that some may not be true. Perhaps a book called Berlin Dance of Death is a better book on the subject, although it is written by only one soldier.This is an OK read, but there are better books out there from German soldiers. The stories are alright, if the reader is familiar with the last battles of the Third Reich."
4,Gripping,"In 1985, I had the opportunity to travel to West Berlin. It remains one of the most amazing trips of my life. Few cities affected me as Berlin did. Standing in the Reichstag was the culmination of this visit. Hard to describe the thoughts and emotions that course through a person who has studied and understood the events that occurred in that place.Tony Le Tissier's book would have been a welcome companion during that trip. The Cold War was still on in 1985 and detail about the final days of the Third Reich were as of that date left untold.Of all the accounts in this volume, Willi Rogman's descriptions of the last battles around the Reichstag and the subsequent attempts to break out of the city are absolutely amazing. Some of his tale is very nearly unbelievable...but truth is always more fantastic than fiction. If for no other reason, read this book to follow Rogman as he does the impossible and escapes from a city in flames. What a story..."
3,Interesting stories from 'the other side of the hill'.,Good collection and well written accounts of the final days of WWII. If you are specifically looking for stories from the German perspective buy this book. Several of the stories are compelling and there is a facinating transcript from German radio communications with a 'fortress' kampfgruppe. For east front enthusiasts this book provides good first person commentary.
5,ADD Kids are Just Like Everybody Else,"Being a parent isn't easy, and learning that your child has an attention problem compounds your job. But Taking A.D.D to School introduces the topic of ADD and ADHD to parents along with their children. All children want to be a part of the group and be just like everybody else; having special needs or being singled out makes that pretty difficult.I encourage you to read this book with your children, and perhaps pick up a copy for your child's classroom as well. Armed with the assurance that ADD kids are just the same as the rest of the group, your child will learn tolerance and understanding. Knowledge is power, and the more we can give our kids, the better prepared they will be to face the temptation to tease or scoff at others who are different than they are.Reading Taking A.D.D to School to your children or students is a wonderful gift you can share. Buy one for yourself and another for a special parent or teacher in your life."
4,Exciting music well played,"We studied the Carbon concerto in orchestration class and I really like it. Axtually, the other two pieces are good too! Even if you don't like modern music you'll like this cd."
5,Thoughtful book on consulting as a life mission,"Best book on consulting I've read; it helps frame whatone can bring *as a person* to a consulting career.Completely different context then the usual ""make $200ka year as a consultant from your own home"" books.I'm buying a copy for me, and one for a friend who isjust entering the field."
5,SACD Goodness...,"Ever since reading Red Storm Rising, I wanted to see the movie Alexander Nevsky since it played a part in the book. when I finally got to see it, I wasn't disappointed. What made the movie good was the delightful soundtrack by Prokofiev. I have the other Alexander Nevsky for the remastered movie. However, it doesn't compare to this one.This one is multichannel which means that an orchestra is filling my living room. Plus you can hear the clarity and depth of the music and some of the details you can't hear on a normal CD. My only complaint about this one is that is excerpts from the soundtrack and not the full thing. But it at least has my favorite tracks from the movie.The music for the Battle on the Ice is top notch. As is the music for the celebration at the end."
4,"difficult, pretty rock'n'roll","This is a bit mellower and more varied than your average Mint release -- here's another fine entry into the yes-we're-imitating-someone-but who-cares? wave of poetically minded, Elliot Smith-or-was-that-Belle & Sebastian influenced indie bands. These Vancouverites deliver the goods -- plenty of moody yet beautiful sketches of modern emotional displacement and pointedly detatched, irony-laden humor. A few songs rock out, but mostly this is a soft & quiet kinda album, and likely to keep your attention if you like that terrain. Worth checking out."
2,Not satisfied,"Price is good recieved on time, but this item after installed right and left is turn is not working only up and down is working. I am not satisfied. Thinking to buy with other parts dealee."
3,A lesson learned,"This DVD completes the show that was represented on Rock and Roll At Fifty. Most of the DVDs of these shows do not present the entire show, only the best numbers. In THIS case, I can understand the wisdom of the editors in presenting what they presented on the first DVD, as many of the songs on the More DVD have the original artistes, but not their original voices: in other words, time and age have not been kind to them. It was nice to see Bo Diddley, but painful to see that he could barely stand up, what to speak of play. These DVDs are valuable for preserving the music, but I think it would be better that some of these artistes be remembered for how they sounded in their heyday. But that is not the DVD maker's fault. What their fault is they stretch a show out to two DVDs, and you have to buy them both if you want to have the entire show. Then you find out WHY the first one was like IT was. It would be better if they could put out the DVD of the entire show."
5,more rock and roll at fifty:live from Pittsburg's Benedum Center,"This is a super great PBS Special from the early pioneers of rock n' roll, that you will enjoy. Especially if your a ""Boomer"" The memories will ""flood back"" of where you were as you listen to so many groups perform there hits. I've watched it repeatly, it makes a good ""party video"" to get your friends up dancing and singing."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this and the instruments are mostly good, but the singer doesn't have a feel for traditional or country music singing, and she sounds flat to me. I wish I could hear the same material by someone with a better range and expressiveness and who can really use her voice, like Patty Loveless or even better Gillian Welch. I think her songs deserve better treatment, but it was a nice thought. Maybe someone will run with this idea and make it into the tribute it deserves."
1,HATE IT bootleg copy,"This is a bootleg copy, illegal and shall be reported.It was the most horrible quality ever... you could not see a thing not to mention the material was mostly in his 80s stuff you have seen better quality elsewhere..DO NOT BUY THIS BOOTLEG.."
1,mess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This video is a hot mess , I buy items from amazon all the time and never have I ever gotten something so bootleg. I will never by from individuals from amazon again.I will stick with the actual amazon company only.The title says ""hits from the 70's , and that's exactly what it looks like, technology from the 70's. The video is blurred at the beginning, then it goes from the 70's to the 80's example motown 25 , wait don't get excited because it's only part of it. Then they included the video ""scream"" which looks the best out the whole video, it just wasn't put together very well. Don't waste your 17.99 like I did with ""win productions"" they should be ashamed! p.s and the cover computer paper and so is the dvd label!"
1,I am a die hard fan but this is crap,"Yup.....I too expected alot of the 70's stuff. ""never can say goodbye"" Who's lovin you"" ""Rockin robin"" all blurred/pixelated. shocking. Then you get Motown 25 (very blurred) which I am dam sure was in the 80's then a snippit of the Geraldo interview while MJ was on the trial of his life over Bashir's BS (very blurred). An interview with Jessa Jackson with only audio also talking about the trial. A ""Bad"" medley from his BAD tour so blurred! Yup...they throw in ""Scream"" (did not know that was done in the 70's!) Fans out there...don't buy it. If you were to grab a video and tape the same clips off UTube, you would get better guality. ""Blame it on the Boogie"" and ""I want you back"" all blurred This should not be sold. All up 10 song clipsWaste of moneyLynne"
1,Not Clear...,"I thought this was going to be a professional dvd. Instead, it was recorded off the tv. The images were blurry & the sound muffled. It's really too bad because I was really looking forward to seeing the Michael of the 70's in action. I returned it. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because it arrived on time."
1,Not at all what I expected.,Michael Jackson's Hits in the 70sThis was a very poor quality DVD. It would not play on all my dvd players only on the computer. I did not expect half of the dvd with Michaeal Jackson being intervied with Geraldo. It was a very poor DVD. I do not recommend wasting your money on this video. Not at all what I expected.
2,Being a J-5 Lover,"I have been a Jackson 5 fan since their first release and I was really happy to acquire this video for my collection. Although, having this video was something that I've waited for, some of the video quality leaves a bit to be desired."
1,Micheal jackson Hits ( WHAT ),"Well I Picked Up This Pce Of Appearances.. Did Ya Look At It Before Ya Put It On DVD. Holy Cow , Can Hardly see the jacksons 5 , Both Volumes Are bad..its a shame I would of love to see micheal and the brothers do there thing , some comedy bits are great, if you can see it. talented group of guys. would of love to see it CLEAR VIDEO."
2,Michael Jackson's HITS in the 70's,"track listings: never can say goodbye, i want you, who's loving you, rockin' robin, & to my surprise ""scream"" which IS NOT a hit of the 70's!!!!the issues are as follows the title is called ""HITS NOT TALK &/OR INTERVIEWS, music is in beginning & end> while both a RADIO INTERVIEW with Jesse Jackson, (the audio is AWFUL) & TALK INTERVIEW with Geraldo Rivera,(which is VERY LENGHTY) is in the middle of this dvd, unheard of this type of format, furthermore if you really wanted to include this it should have been placed at the end, (with a option to play or not)I rated this DVD a 1 (POOR) for its MISLEADING CONTENT, for ADDING INTERVIEWS instead of ""HITS"" as promised!!!!!"
4,Bird Toy,"I put this toy on top of the cage. Seemed to enjoy playing with it but also pulled it to the back of the cage and got it close enough to the wall to stand on it and pull the paper of the sheet rock. Not the toys fault, be careful where you put it."
3,Interesting addition to my cookbook collection.,"This small hard covered book of Preserves has many fine and easy recipies that I cant wait to get started on once the spring and summer roll around. You cant beat the taste of homemade preserves!! Not only are they a labour of love, but you know what every one is made of. Fresh ingredients and love. What more can you ask for?"
4,Don't believe the BS!,"This is one of the hottest bands with one of the hottest and most original and exciting stage shows around. Take a single look at the writing style of the negative reviews on this site and you will see that the writer is obviously the same person with a hate grudge of some sort. DON""T BELIEVE THE BS! Have a listen yourself. Powder rocks hard. Ninette is incredible and the imagination and creativity that she puts into the live show can clearly be heard in the music. Phil X is one of, if not THE, best guitarists in Los Angeles and maybe even the US. If you EVER are within 300 miles of a Powder show it will be one of the most incredible gigs you will ever see."
1,Worst Song Ever,"This is one of the worst songs I have ever heard performed by one of the worst bands I have ever seen. The lead singer's voice is so bad that it actually hurts my ears, the guitar riffs are tired and the video to this song is just ridiculous. I have a feeling that the reason you can only get this single through Europe is because there is no way that this kind of band would ever make it in the United States."
1,"""Up Here"" Not Very Good","This song is really not that good. I saw this band play in Chicago and they are not very talented at all. The lead singer has trouble hitting her notes and the guitarist maybe knows 4 cords. They do wear silly costumes and wigs which is somewhat entertaining, but you can't cover bad musicianship with a wig and a g-string."
1,Not Worth The Money,"This song is just bad. This band has no talent, the lead singer's voice is horrific and the lyrics are just inane. I do not recommend this CD to anyone."
3,Mildly entertaining however long,"This book is not one that you will sit down and read over a weekend. It is a slow reader, however the chapters are relativly short. There is typical Mark Twain humor, which I love. I wish there was more of his wit in the book. Not my favorite book by him, but for the love of the author, I read on!"
4,Don't be misled by Christmas tree,"Although this is a another great Berenstain collection teaching important values for kids, I bought it to put in my Christmas collection of shorts. Seeing the cover showing a Christmas tree, wreath, and gifts I assumed (incorrectly) that at least one of the episodes would be for or about the holidays. None of these episodes are about Christmas. One could argue that good manners and values are for all seasons and it is true I did like the DVD, but was a bit disappointed there wasn't a special Christmas episode (like the collection ""Christmas Tree."") If you are looking specifically for a Christmas cartoon, get that one instead."
5,Excellent Chili,"This was a great chili, Mildly spicy without going over the top. Those who like it mild would like it, while those who want it spicier can easily add a little pep to it making it just right."
3,Not bad but doesn't capture the 'real' Pooch,"The music on this CD is well done, and well-performed. Pooch is a talented group of musicians who tend toward positive vibes and heavy grooves. The only real downfall of the CD is that it doesn't capture even half of the energy of a Pooch show. The CD falls a little flat due to the fairly timid production and frequently off-key vocals. All in all, it's not a bad release, but a few minor changes could have made it better."
1,Reviewer in South Dakota,Way to go Herb - excellent music - songs are very well written -this is music that a person can listen to and understand what is being said. To anyone reading this review - buy this CD - South Dakota loves ya Pooch!!
5,Three parrots love this.,My three African Grey Parrots all had established diets prior to my adopting them. The alpha male requires weighted metal dog dishes as he will successfully dump what he does not like unto the floor. The others will glare at me if not satisfied. Zupreem Natural is what they all prefer although they do not relish the fruit flavored variety. Only online am I able to acquire a 20lb bag which is much more economical than seven 3lb bags. A treasure of a find.
2,Poor Quality,The quality of the food seems poor. The pellets are usually more solid. These pellets are more porus and more seems to go in the cage and not in the bird.
5,Beautiful,"I barely remembered the Bachelors rendition of ""Diane"" until I heard it again at a friends home. I had to get their album; their harmony is so beautiful. My husband and I just love the other songs on their album. I am so glad I ordered it.Debbie"
2,If you are into frustration...this is your game!,The only thing worse than a boring PC game is one that you cannot win. In their over-exuberance to create a masterpiece of graphic design the developers of this gothic horror forgot something. When you frustrate your audience to tears they take your game and throw it against a wall. Save your money folks. By level 8 (if you make it that far) this bad boy will end up fragments in your trash can!
4,Very fun.,Very Fun third person slasher game - You have alot of characters to play with and you can build them up as you play - The only thing that could have been improved is the ability to do special moves and also the lead characters looks paled in comparison to the computer controlled players - once your over these things - the game is very fun - and you can play both light or dark campaigns - which are completely different games.
3,Too long for our cradle,"This bumper was too long for my sons standard sized cradle. Like other reviewers, I felt that this was a safety hazard, so I cut off the access (several inches) and sewed up the end. I also had to add extra ties, because no matter how I placed it in the cradle, it wouldn't fit securely against the edge because there are not enough ties to hold it in place. After ""fixing"" it, I have no complaints; it was inexpensive, and held up well after washing in the delicate cycle. I would suggest trying it out in your cradle to make sure it fits before you get rid of the packaging/reciept."
3,look at dimensions,"this product popped up on my screen as a good one to buy along with the BABY BED dust ruffle that i was purchasing, so i mistakenly thought that it went with it. look at the dimensions though because it did not fit the baby bed that my dust ruffle fit just fine.this item is for a CRADLE (smaller than a baby bed). the quality was ok though. i would have kept it if it would have fit."
1,Disapointed,It doesn't even sound like Clancy Hayes. I don't want it in my collection of Scobey and Clancy!
2,Not a great sheet,"I put this sheet on my baby registry beacuse I thought the Jersey knit would be nice and soft for baby... The problem is, the sheets (I have 2 in ecru and 1 in sun)have developed little pills where my son puts his head. Sure, after 7 months the fit is still great, but pills started a couple months ago and now are starting to irritate his little cheeks! I would not recommend this brand to my friends!"
4,Musculoskeletal Scanning: Unchartered Territory,"This is a great hands-on tool. I worked side by side with another sonographer while we attempted to scan pathological joints (rotator cuffs, knees, elbows, etc.). The images in this book were great references for identifying anatomy while we scanned. It would be nice, as an addition, to have side-by-side comparisons of normal versus abnormal images of joints. This is my only complaint. Otherwise, very user friendly for both the experienced musculoskeletal scanner and for the novice."
1,A waste of money,"This is Cal Worthington (the used car guy) and Tammy Faye Baker (the evangelist wife, with meaningful tearful pauses, small gasps and all) teaching ESP for the Lord.The majority of these CDs consist of people mentally masturbating themselves over whatever they have managed to figure out and why they sell this overrated product instead of getting a useful job.There is no instruction here on ESP and if you're looking for a hypnotism CD or positive thinking product you can get a better one on ebay for $10-$12. Seriously, don't waste your money. It is 5 1/2 CD's of personal boring testimony and 1/2 CD total on putting yourself in alpha with their personal instruction on what you can and can't do when you get there."
5,Great book for anyone familiar with Silva's workl,I cherish this book. I read the book 1.5 years ago and it motivated me to get back into Silva again. it also inspired me to take the UltraMind Seminar which lead to unbeleivably powerful psychic experiences for me. It also helped me with my career - getting a raise and doubline my sales quota in 1 month.Loved it. A must read - although if you've never studied Silva before you might get a bit lost.
4,"Bought the Silva Ultramind Course, needed more explanation so got the book!",Read the book. Definitely more focused on Burt Goldman but the long relax meditation by silva is like the best for complete relaxation and peace. The book is good. I think if I read it more times which I will certainly do I will come away with more from it in understanding and using the Silva techniques. Dont really agree with some of what Silva teaches but would definitely be cool to communicate with your higher self and the universe. There are some key things in here but just havent got to practicing them yet!
4,industrial goth strikes again!,"industrial/goth outfit, Neon Judgement brings forthmore of what we've come to love from Wax Trax artistsof the 80s/early 90s. My favorite track is Miss Brown.If you're a fan of Sisters of Mercy, The Cassandra Complex,or London After Midnight, you should check this album out!"
2,Disapointed fit and finish,"First of all, this item is shipped as freight, so delivery is not via the UPS guy like most of my Amazon products.Secondly, some of the pieces were labled wrong. The seat had a sticker on it (Back) that was clearly in the front by the illustration--and the only way it would fit together. The major assembly is by Tenon and dowels, which is fine, but impossible to take apart to replace or re-asseble (see next point).Finally, one of the pre-assembled joints was poor and I had to use glue to keep it together. All-in all, I don't recommend this product."
4,Solid chair,"Solid construction. Comfortable. Assembly may be difficult for some, but a reasonable project. Time will tell how weather resistent it is."
2,Sometimes a bit flaky!,"I was pleased with the lens when I first got it and it worked wonderfully. Then, within a couple of months, it started 'flaking out' on me. Sometimes it would illuminate and sometimes it wouldn't. I thought it was a battery problem, but it wasn't... it was just flaky! For what Meade charges for this lens, I wish I had looked a little further and found a better quality eyepiece. Oh well, that is the state of products on the market today, I guess. I gave it a 2 stars because it worked for a couple of months, if it operated when I got it like it does now, I would have given it 1 star and sent it back. You decide."
3,It's ok.,"Honestly, I'd have to say it's an average country album. Nothing specific really, I just can't find any other songs that click for me! I bought it because of Forgive, and honestly that's about the only thing I'd use it for.If you've just heard Forgive, I'd recommend buying a digital download of just that song and saving your money for another album."
2,Got Personanality?,"If you are wondering why you never heard of Rebecca Lynn Howard? You probably did heard ""Forgive,"" you just don't remember it as it blended so unnoticably with the milage of Faith Hill/Dianne Warren slop foisted off on Country radio. And it is a shame, because with a little backbone and a little steel it could have been a stunningly good country song. However, no one involved with the making of the album cared to do anything that would make it stand out. And that is the inheriant flaw with this album. For, while she flirts with a grown woman in love and in touch with her country roots on a couple of songs, Howard perfers the mindless autowittering that has taken over so much of country music today."
4,A Great Sophomore album!,"Having heard and seen the video for her new single FORGIVE many many times, I finally caved in and purchased this cd today. There are many upbeat songs and some very emotional themed songs. There is the fun DANCIN' IN GOD'S COUNTRY to the very positive LIFE HAD OTHER PLANS about learning that everything happens for a reason in life....there are ballads and fast paced songs...something for everyone....my only two problems are that on some songs her voice seems secondary to the instruments and production and also some songs are just plain silly.....she shines best when putting her voice in the foreground and singing about emotional subjects....I look forward to her next cd....she is a great new talent!"
2,Only One Good Song,"Other than the title track all the other songs are very annoying. Her voice gets very nasal and whiny. I was disappointed because she sounds so good on ""Forgive."""
5,wow!,well rebecca lynn howard has proven to everyone that she is here to stay! the amazing combination of her songriting and vocal talents make this album a pleasure to listen to from the first to the last track! i think everyone who appreciates great country music will love this album! buy it now!
5,hilarious,"Someone gave me this book, and damn it's funny. Not only that, I actually learned a lot from it... But don't tell my wife. I bought a couple copies for gag gifts, and they were big hits."
5,Classic,"Love this CD. It takes me back to the late 90s when French house was just hitting American shores. There's a few duds on it, but otherwise it's damn near perfect."
1,quite possibly the worst peice of house in my collection,"quite possibly the worst peice of house in my collection - an unispired collection of french house easily eclipsed by any other ""various artists"" u care to mention. boring, repetitive. no usable beats, and at times completely unmixable.I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone dj or other.etienne, bob sinclar at their worst.buy ""my house in montramiane"" or ""discoteca"" youll be better off."
2,Panasonic TC-40 VHS Camcorder Tape,Very Much over priced. You can buy 3 tapes at Walgreens for $9.00 and I paid about $16.00 for 1 60 minute tape.
4,good Hardware & Software but Driver still needs work,"The label maker is great and the software works well, you can use any font and it isn't bad to use. The software is somewhat like MS Publisher but not quite as polished.My only complaint is that I didn't plan on leaving it plugged in all the time but I found problems with this. If you install the drivers on one USB port and move to a different port on the hub or PC the drivers don't install correctly, the drivers keep tring to go to the original USB port, weird. If you leave it plugged in all the time or remember which port you used you should have no problem."
3,first time cooking with bonito,"i was surprised at how small the portions were when receiving these. considering that when watching iron chef machiba cook with them he uses like 1/2 a kilo! what i found out however is, a little bit goes a long way. a good product but in order for you to maximize your dollar, i suggest ordering more than one item as the shipping was more than the item's actual cost. hence the 3 of five"
3,Good looking but a little off,Nice item. Looks good but color is a little off. The picture shows a bright yellow as expected but the actual color on my statue is more of a darker brown mustard yellow. Heavy and solid.
2,"CO2 tank empty, and crappy mask",Really good marker but the CO2 tank was empty and the hopper is cracked and the mask is a throwaway. Should'nt show things you are going to send bad or wrong.
4,new favorite,"My kids 2 and 5 rarely agree on any shows but for some reason both have fallen in love with Kipper. This DVD is about winter activities with just a nod to Christmas. It is very even paced (bit boring for adults) but for my daughter who scares easily it is perfect. She cannot do the Rudolphs or frosty movies but can handle this. It explores simple joys of winter like making a snowman (snow dogs), sledding etc. It is a nice change from Christmas all the time. I would recommend it for the younger set."
2,Kipper-Let it Snow,"this was the cheapest VHS I've ever ordered. First..it took MONTHS to come and then it was as if EACH story was spliced unto a blank tape. EACH story had the ENDING credits and then it started the next story. It was ONLY 30 minutes long. I saw this SAME tape at [a store] and it was 60 MINUTES long. Bad, bad taping...could have done it myself"
4,Great intro to Shamanic Journeying and includes drumming CD,"After hearing Sandra talk on KVMR the other day I decided to buy this book.It was written very concisely with easy to follow instructions. I didn't give it five stars because the book is a bit repetitive ( it literally looked like portions were copied and paste ) and has little information other than basic journeying techniques. The book is more like a pamphlet to go with the drumming CD.All in all, it was a good purchase and I will share it with many people."
5,shamanic drumming,I bought this book not knowing anything about shamanic drumming. I was pleasantly surprised with the great information. The CD included with the book is wonderful to listen to. I will treasure this purchase. thanks.
2,Disapointing,I had bought this book a while back and if I may speak frank it really didnt help in any way.
1,Wish I could return it,"The woman writes that an airplane has a spirit. I understand that there can be a spirit in an atom, but not in thing created by a human being. Sorry I don't bother to look at this book again to write you more ""cheese"" that I found there."
4,Excellent Overview for Beginners,"Sandra's latest of several publications addressing the practical aspects of contemporary shamanism provides an excellent, clearly described overview of the shamanic journey and is a great introduction to the process for beginners. As a teacher/facilitator of journeying, I found it also a worthwhile read as a way of getting back in touch with the basics of the practice with new approaches to telling the story of journeying and answering common questions and concerns. At 78 pages, it can be read and absorbed quickly, and the included CD is a great asset to putting the journey process to practice immediately.This book is not for you if you are looking for a deeper or more academic understanding of the journeying process. However, if you have always wondered what the shamanic journey is about and how it can be used to improve your life, health and relationships, this is a great place to start."
5,Shamanic Journeying:A Beginners Guide,This is the book if you want to learn about how to Journey.It is well written and very informative....I read it in one night and have reread several times since.A must book for anyone wanting to begin the journey into the world of Shaman practice. The book comes with a cd of drum-rattle sounds to help you journey. This part is essential for the practice.
5,Awesome!,Sandra Ingerman is wonderful. I am grateful she made these ancient healing techniques accessible to all. And the drumming CD is a huge bonus.
4,Shamanic journey,This book comes with a drumming CD which facilitates the shamanic meditative state. It is a good introduction to shamanism. I am a full mesa carrying shaman. I have not read the whole book yet but still can see its value from the information presented in a easy comprehensive form.
4,great deal,"i have a 2002 corolla, and it fit perfectly.the reason i give it 4 stars is because the mirror distorts more around the edges than the original mirror. but it's nothing that impairs the function of the mirror."
5,Great Buy,Awesome deal. I was extremely happy with this purchase. I reccomend others to buy this item.
5,KitchenAid KSC700OB 7-Quart Slow Cooker,"This Slow cooker was purchased for my wife. Her profession is cooking and has been for some 30 plus years. She owns several brands of crock pots and all of them work well. However, they only have at the most 3 settings, low, medium and auto shift. The KitchenAid has more settings and allows better control over any item to be prepared. My wife has used this product on several main course meals that she has prepared in the other conventional crock pots before and we both agree the end results are far superior in visual display, not overcooked and most important of all, flavor. We have since given the conventional crock pots away and will purchase another KitchenAid for when we need more than one to prepare meals for family get-togethers or large social functions. We give this item 5 stars and wish only that this product was available in a 18 to 22 quart size to accomodate large turkeys, hams and prime ribs/roasts."
1,Another disappointed consumer!,"In the first five minutes after starting my slow cooker the day after I received it, there was a very loud, explosive sound and I knew right away that it had cracked.\I decided to let the food cook to the end in hopes that the crack wouldn't allow too much seepage. Probably not too smart to do that, but the meal cooked great. However, the crock is indeed cracked and there was a small amount of seepage. I called customer serviceeven before the food was cooked and they said they would send me a whole new slow cooker. I haven't received it yet but do hope the new one has a crock from a new production line. I just love the programming possibilities of this cooker and from my one experience am very pleased with temperatures at which the food cooked. Just so disappointed over the cracking...I thought by now that situation would have been corrected."
2,Cracked on first use,"Despite the reviews reporting cracks in the pot, I bought this because of the multiple settings, the size and the good experience I've had with Kitchenaid. Lo and behold, I used it for the first time yesterday and within 10 or 15 minutes of starting my spaghetti sauce, I heard a loud crack. You guessed it - the pot had cracked on the side. Earth to Kitchenaid - you have a problem here!"
2,Mine cracked too UPDATED,"Think twice -- mine also cracked on first usage. 5 stars for Amazon customer service! But if the replacement cracks, I will be asking for a refund instead of trying again -- this is ridiculous. I highly recommend buying things through Amazon for their excellent service, though.-----2/20/08: Replacement cracked on second usage. I recommend against this slow cooker, which was otherwise ideal. Argh!"
2,Kitchen Aid Slow Cooker,I purchased this item with excitement but after 1 year the ceramic dish has a crack in it. The slow cooker leaks and I am having trouble getting a replacement due to the back oreder issue. I am very disappointed in Kitchen Aid and this is not typical of their items. I hope they do not stay on this trend of crappy kitchen appliances.
1,Don't Buy Me,"I was extremely disappointed with this slow cooker because the crock cracked on the third use. I wasn't able to get my money back because I'd had it longer than 90 days, which was the warranty at that time. I understand that if you go directly to Kitchen Aid, they'll consider refunding your money for up to a year after purchase. Realize that this slow cooker is enormous and weighs 22 pounds. Picture yourself finding a place to store it because a high cabinet won't work and you'll get tired of hauling it from the basement or garage. The crockery part is dangerously slippery in the sink and takes up the entire bottom of the dishwasher. This thing is a monster and unless you have a huge family and will use it all the time, it's not worth it. I paid $19.95 for a different brand at Kohl's or Target and could've bought 5 of those for what I paid for this Kitchen Aid. The cheap one has been working great for over a year. Normally, I'm a fan of Kitchen Aid, but not this time."
1,ANOTHER cracked crock!!!,"Okay, my 4th crock insert has cracked! I have been told by Kitchenaid that they had a ""bad batch of crocks"" but going thru 4 in a year??? They have been great in the fact that they keep replacing it but I finally said that I am thru and they are giving me a credit towards other Kitchenaid merchandise. I am on the hunt for another crock...Love the features of this slow cooker, but without a functional crock, they are not much good..."
1,"Horrible, Horrible Experience. 4 ceramic crocks later.","Delighted to get this beautiful product...until I used it. Craaack! What was that noise? The ceramic crock cracking during the first use. Oh, well. Just an exception to the rule. This is KitchenAid, right? The best, right? So, I wrote to the company and they sent me another ceramic crock. That cracked on the first use also. I wrote again, and they sent me a replacement appliance and a return shipping form. I sent the first slow cooker back and was delighted to have a new cooker, whose crock cracked during the first use. So, I notified the company. This time I was very upset. They replaced the ceramic crock, which dutifully cracked this time during the second use. I'm done! I have NEVER had a slow cooker that behaved this way, and I can't believe a fine company like KitchenAid is allowing these cookers to be sold. Let the buyer beware!"
2,Be wary,On my very first use of this appliance the ceramic liner developed a five inch crack. I was hoping to have better luck than some posters here but in fact my unit cracked earlier than many others. The only thing keeping me from rating this one star now is the assurance that Kitchenaid will have a replacement out to me in two weeks or so.KitchenAid 7 qt. Slow Cooker - Onyx Black
1,Wrong item sent,"As described, I ordered a ""hand winch with cable"", however; upon arrival I received a hand winch with a strap (not a cable which is needed for my pulley system) which does not or will not meet my needs. When I complained to the shipper there was no response. Since it cost too much to return I just threw it on the shelf with the other junk."
1,save your money,"the cable kinked after one use, the handle bound up and was hard to remove, save your money this thing is garbage."
4,pleased with reservations,"The winch came in as promised. It looks good and after mounting to an adapted 2x4, works great in the back of my truck. The few things wrong with the product is ,like other reveiwers stated, the steel cable was not tightly wound up on the spool and thus became entangled when trying to unwind it in order to rewind it tightly. The end of the cable is not tightly affixed to the spool so be careful totally unwinding it. The gear ratio need to be a little more off set. I used it to pull my son 125cc 4-wheeler up into my truck and my son had difficulty turning the crank, while i had to push the ATV up into the bed of my truck. I didnt get any paperwork with the tinsel strength or other product information, but if i'm pulling anything that is liable to break that cable, my mount will break before it does. 4 out of 5 because the cable mounting and loose spooling is very unprofessional and time consuming, and gear ratio is off, but great product hauling up a deer."
3,OK for light duty,"Bought this for my utility trailer to help in loading mowers and other stuff too heavy and awkward to push up loading ramp, Works ok but not highest quality. Bought online because of price and hard to find locally unless of higher quality and price"
4,"Well, It's just a power adapter! But it works fine.","Thanks, it works fine, does the job, all that is required. There was a slight mixup on my order but after bringing it to the company's attention another one was sent immediately."
1,Very unhappy,"When I placed the original order, described what I needed, gave name of printer I needed the power adapter cord for, plus model number, etc. You sent me the wrong cord. Now I can not return it without paying a restocking charge. I am disapointed with on-line ordering. Sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is a P-touch?????????"
2,rip-off,brother labeler didn't work on just batteries checked and found adapter sold separately for almost as much as the labeler what a rip off.
1,Failed after a year,"Worked fine for awhile, but then failed. PT-1750 unit comes on only momentarily when the battery adapter power line is connected, then the unit shuts off. I suspect an internal failure, possibly some kind of overload protection, in the transformer, but Brother has not responded."
2,NOT for Model PT-550: Advertising needs clarification,"I've searched high and low for a few years now for a power adapter for the P-Touch PT-550. The advertisement led me to believe this might finally work. It doesn't. The PT-550 takes a 9.5 volt adapter, and it's VERY finicky about any variations in voltage. 9.0 won't work, nor will anything above 9.5.No variable voltage wall wort I've found will put out a 9.5 volt AC either. The PT-550 sucks batteries quickly. If you're going to get an older model P-Touch, stay far away from the 550 (although it functions well other than the power issues), and DON'T buy this power adapter for your existing 550."
3,Boring,I am in love with Putumayo's Latin Lounge and wanted more but I find Nuevo Latino so boring. I am hoping it grows on me.
5,Life changer!,I heard of these minerals on the kevin trudeau radio show and decided to buy them. Within the first 2 days i noticed i had more energy throughout the entire day and i slept solid everynight. Its now been almost a month and its getting better. I also realised that im eating less. I do eat all organic whole food so i cant say that the minerals alone is responsible for how i feel but i can say that they definetly made a very noticable improvement in my overall health and vitality. I will now use these for life. Thanks dr. Morters an KT!
5,Amazing for Scars!!!,"This stuff is incredible!! My mom got a bottle of this from her Naturopath for healing a small cut she had. It stings like heck on open cuts, but it works! She gave a bottle to me for a year old cesarean scar I had. I'd tried expensive treatments from my dermatologist that did nothing at all. Only a week after switching to the trace minerals I noticed a visible healing of my scar! :D I started mixing it with coconut oil as it's very watery... I've been using it once per day for 5 months now... parts of my previously red, knotty, long scar are actually gone and smooth!! :D It's really astounding. :) The rest of the scar is fading and shrinking too. :)"
5,Wahl Peanut Hair Trimmer,"This is a dependable and accurate trimmer. Exactly what I need to keep my beard trimmed and neat. I use a stiffer brush to clean it afterwards, as the brush provided loses its shape and bristle strength after a few weeks. The palm size is great and the trimmer width is small enough to trim accurately."
3,Great production - poor engineering,"A brilliant, imaginative production of Wagner's most popular opera. Excellent singing, faithful conducting, superlative direction and great video management. My only quibble is with the sound engineers: the orchestra sounds as if it is in the next room, with the singers set well forward on the sound stage, relegated to a secondary, accompanying role rather than an equal partner with the vocalists. A pity: but for that imperfection this would be the best Lohengrin in the catalog. This is not a version for audiophiles."
1,Terrible House Music,"I guess I missed the point of this Junior Vasquez CD. Just a dreadful compilation of very poor, uninspired House music. I was surprised and disappointed at the same time."
3,Hard to find item,"this is a relatively old hk film that is out of circulation, so i'm very happy to have found it on amazon. thanks!"
5,Gilad is Tops!,"This workout is all about improving your athleticism, and it definitely does just that. It really has helped me get in shape by increasing my speed, stamina and strength. Like it says above, this series is being called the best video workouts ever made. And I for one, can attest to that, or at least right up there with any other workout. Gilad is also great at communicating with you and lets you know everything that is going on and why. He's very thorough and informative! If you are looking to get in shape and know why and how, this is the way to go. Highly recommended!"
5,I love this album,"Recently, I have begun rebuilding my music library. This in one album that I never had. I love this album, yet, I amvery biased... I LOVE ALL CROSBY, STILLS, NASH... AND EVEN MOST NEIL YOUNG."
3,decent effort by c & n,"cool and listenable album if you dig crosby, stills, & nash or csny. a little slow and boring at times, so, if you lean more towards the ROCKOUT end of things, you might find your attention wandering and you might be better served by the csny compilation called 'so far' or the csny studio album, 'deja vu'--the album absolutely never goes beyond mid-tempobut nevertheless, there are some gems here: south bound train, immigration man, frozen smiles, the wall song, and where will i be. cool mellow listen .just doesn't get played too often."
4,crosby pulls thru,"here is an album that seems to have slipped by everyone. well worth the purchase alone are two of crosby's best songs ever recorded. ""whole cloth"" has such a beautiful chord progression its eerie. and crosby's ""games"" is truly gorgeous--right up there with yes, ""guinevere"". the harmony during the chorus penetrates deeply. if this man wasn't as great an artist and songrwiter as he was during the late 60's/early 70's, miles davis would have never covered ""guinevere"". ""the wall song"" is i believe the only studio version available and it is quite sweet with the help of jerry garcia and phil lesh. nash is has some commendable stuff on here, but like most of nash's work, its too pop and stiff for me. must be the brit in him. although flawed, this album has a few memorable gems worthy of a space in your cd rack."
4,"Excellent ""Début""","After the initial demise of CSNY, David Crosby and Graham Nash decided to continue working together. This was their first album together and one of their best. It was a big hit in the US (reaching number 4 on the Billboard album chart and being certified GOLD) and produced their only top 40 hit ""Immigration Man"" and the minor follow-up hit ""Southbound Train"". This was a strong album and provided a needed ""fix"" for fans who wished that CSNY had continued."
5,"I've not heard all of Wim's music, but this is my favorite","The reviewer from Portugal may be a bit perfunctory, but the word is well-chosen. This is a wonderful collection, fun, surprising, entertaining and endlessly listenable.Wim Mertens has been cranking out his idiosyncratic music to a largely uninterested world for a long, long time. Sometimes he hits, sometimes he misses, sometimes you wonder if he even swung. But this is as solid a work as he's done. The playing is so tight and effective that the cacaphony of sounds becomes a collection of beauties only a real genius could audialize (if I may coin a word similar to visualize). And the singing is just gorgeous.If you've heard of Wim Mertens and wonder whether this is for you, this is a great intro. If you've only heard his solo work, this will be a surprise--more melodious, more textured, more full and better vocals.A solid winner worthy of a much wider audience!"
1,didn't last long.,bought one for my dell laptop. lasted only 3 months under normal usage and it would no longer take a charge.
1,Techpower laptop battery,I purchased the TechPower battery for my Dell laptop. The battery shorted out the laptop motherboard and caused me to lose everything on the laptop. The laptop could not be restored. Had to go purchase another laptop.
1,OVERPRICED!,They charged almost 3 times as much as i could find it locally! Very displeased! Took over 3 weeks to get a refund! Never again!
2,Wheels Fall Apart,"I bought 2 of these chairs 4 years ago because they were on sale. I was very happy with them for the first year. They felt sturdy and well-made, easily rolled anywhere and I loved the sliding tray. After the first year we found that the wheels were falling apart -- on BOTH chairs. I kept putting them back together, like a puzzle, even tried gluing them back together. I've also been looking everywhere for replacement wheels that are more sturdy, but haven't found anything that fits. It wouldn't be worth it to have them replaced by the manufacturer because they would just send the same crappy wheels. It really is a shame because the rest of the chair is just perfect and sturdy. I would have given 5 stars if not for the wheels. My next goal is to see if I can buy wheels from a different manufacturer."
4,great product,"I bought two of these last year and am ordering a couple more to go with them. They are stylish, functional, hold up well. The only quibble I have is that the wheels could be sturdier. The wooden wheel breaks apart easily; we don't move the chairs much, but do leave them outside year-round (we have mild winters). It is a very nice looking wheel but could be a bit more functional with sturdier wood trim. I would still recommend this chair, and in fact am buying a couple more for myself."
4,Children make a difference,"John-B knows he is lucky, because he lives on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay where there many wonderful things in his natural world, especially a stand of old oak trees in which a pair of Bald Eagles nest & raise their young, each spring.This year, however, John-B's teacher tells her fifth grade students that the land has been sold to a development company, which is going to cut down those beautiful oak trees, & build a condominium.The children decide they have to do something to save these amazing birds' home, they write letters & invite everyone to come watch the eaglets in their nest.With attractive illustrations by David Aiken, Carolyn Stearns has written a charming, informative story of how people can make a difference in the world in which they live."
2,Breaks Easily,"I bought two of these for my Dad (one for the walker and one for the wheelchair). It didn't fit on his first walker (very basic hospital type walker). The frame was too small for the cup alone, and too big to use the adapter. He later got a HUGO walker and it did fit that one fine. The down side is that it breaks very easily! I am frequently lifting my Dad's walker and putting it in the trunk of the car, and it is very easy to break the plastic drink cup holder. (The second drink cup holder got broken when we checked the walker with the airline, and I suppose I should have seen that one coming). Otherwise, they worked fine for the short time we had them."
2,"Good information, hard to read.","There is a lot of good information (basically everything youwant to know about designing a helicopter) in this book, but plan tospend a lot of time looking back at previous equations and what the symbols stand for. The symbols change throughout the book making it more confusing. If you want information on in-depth details about design, this book can help. If you are just curious about helicopters, I'd go with a less detailed book."
5,GREAT PRICE! FAST DELIVERY,"Great Price for this special and useful text book, good condition, and fast delivery. It was for a gift to a friend in Mexico"
1,Terrible to do business with.,Shipped very late and 80% of the bars were broken. Terrible customer service. Do NOT buy from this seller.
2,No comparison to The Hinge Factor,"I very much enjoyed reading ""The Hinge Factor"" and so I bought this book hoping to find more similar reading material. Chapter 1 raised my doubts and after finishing Chapter 2 I was really disappointed by this book. The episodes are really lenghty and somewhat hard to read/follow - the book is not well written. The most disappointing fact, however, is that this book has not very much to do with military history but focuses almost entirely on political history. The influence of the weather, as the title of the book suggests, seems almost constructed and bears almost no meaning to the events described."
1,Don't waste your time,"If you're interested in the weather (as the title might just lead you to expect), don't bother. If your interests lie in military history, then you may enjoy it. The book is littered with factual innacuracies and bizarre grammar (is this a translation?, or is Durschmied a non-native English speaker who couldn't be bothered to have his text proofed?) and the author mixes fact with fiction to such an extent that one ends up presuming the whole thing is made up and tossing it in the nearest rubbish bin."
4,Climate is different than weather,"When a hurricane struck New Orleans, it produced more than a natural disaster: it produced the understanding that global warming would have long ranging effects. In this book specific historical trends were changeddue to weather ( battles were won or lost or never fought).If the Soviet Union had used atomic weapons on Europethey would have doomed themselves to fall out as a result.The Chinese navy off Japan and the Spanish Armada both found that winds can play a big part in war.The last chapter talks about controlling the forces of weatherusing some of the new discoveries of science.This mostly history book is a useful and educational one."
3,Could have been better,"Weather Factor is Durschmied's second contribution of interesting yet counter-factual history. While still entertaining, Durschmied seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel or was rushed to publish Weather Factor. His characteristic writing style is lacking in the sequel as is the solid analysis present in Hinge Factor. Weather Factor is still worth the read, but like many sophomore productions, does not live up to the original."
2,Was awesome for a few months...,"I loved this battery for the first couple of months after I got it. I could use my laptop for almost 4 hours on it. But within 6 months, it was down to 45 minutes and then by 7 months, it would not hold a charge at all. My kid accidentally unplugs it and it shuts down. The original battery even after 2 years, would still give me a couple of minutes after it got unplugged. This battery is not worth it to me as it just does not last."
4,battery for laptop,a friend told me about amazon so i tried and bought this battery for my laptopit is of a little different design from the original but fits and works fine
4,"Works, but not certain it's a Lenmar","The product arrived quickly. Packaging was a joke - the battery was sort of taped to some bubble wrap and tossed in a box. It arrived unharmed, though. There are no brand markings whatsoever, so no way to know what I have. I bought this because the OEM battery barely operates for more than 30 minutes and a similar replacement battery is completely dead. This battery seems to keep my notebook running for a couple of hours at least. I have not tried it for any extended use."
4,A page turner,"What a great summer read! Had everything to keep interest going all through the book, with an exciting ending to boot. It really gave me a glimpse into a musician's world, and the fact that it takes place in some of the most beautiful settings in the world (Carmel-Big Sur-San Francisco)just added to the pleasure. Hope there are more of these to come."
5,"great, creative player","super experimental player/composer! i've seen/heard Scrote many times live/recorded and he always keeps me on the edge of my seat!InstrumentalsAsmodeus: The Book of Angels, Vol. 7Prezens"
3,Some good info,"I heard about this book grom a forum on marriage that I belong to. My hubby and are currently in marriage counseling. I thought the author's concepts were interesting and he definitely tries to sell his point of view. There were some poinys I did not agree with, but overall it was helpful. My hubby is reading it now. We hope it opens up new ways of relating to eachother. I got it as a companion to our profession marriage counselling."
5,great book,this book is a must for married couples or men and women considering marriage. great book to go through with your spouse to strengthen your marriage.
5,Sure Cure for Ailing Marraige,"Willard Harley Jr. in his book, Love Busters, gives very readable and useable cures for passionless, pointless, pitable marriages. He guides the reader through clear ways to change from conflict to intimacy. Yes, with the same spouses that promised to commit their lives together on their wedding day and now have fallen out of love, his steps work to lead them back to the passion they experienced as newlyweds."
1,Did not work,"This probably works if both people read it. However, if only one person does then it won't be effective. Please pay attention when the other person speaks."
4,Not bad....but,"it's based a lot on his previous book. I don't like feeling like I've purchased the same book twice. Overall, a good read & helpful to my marriage."
3,"Mostly good, but some flaws.","I bought this calender a few days ago and I am returning it for a few reasons.1. The pictures get repeated, so you get the same picture on the ""half-birthday"" of a particular date.2. Most of the pictures portrayed female angels. Considering that my favorite angel is Michael, this was disapointing.3. The picture that was on my birthday featured some really ugly cherubs. (This ended up being the final clincher in me returning it).But...to say some good things...A good portion of the pictures were pretty, and the messages were very ispirations. I love Doreen Virtue's Oracle Cards (especially the Goddess, Fairy, and Archangel decks) and this calender would have been quite nice had there been what I mentioned above."
5,Great classic,This is an excellent start to a great classic series. I would recommend this show to any new generation sitcom lover. You won't find a great show like this anymore
5,a great tv show,the Jeffersons is a great tv show its well written and its very funnyi enjoy watiching it over and over
5,The good al days!,I love the 70's! What more can I say? Go and get your copy!Cant wait to get my hands on the second season.
1,would of been nice to get it,i am not to happy about this i wanted this video but i never got it at all and i am not happy about it at all. but i do like the show
4,great!,I received the item in excellent time and the product was in excellent conditioln. There were no scratches and the dvd played as though it was new.
5,somewhat forgotten but shouldn't be,"I have most of Todd's albums and this is my favorite. That is a little strange, given that I usually don't care for horns, which are present on several songs, but their use doesn't detract from the high quality of any of these well crafted, creative, and engaging songs.A note to those who've never seen Todd live: having seen him play twice during the past 18 months, I can say that living a full life in today's United States requires seeing him play live at least once."
4,A Folk Record With Horns,"I really enjoy Todd Snider's Happy To Be Here. He has great song writing skills and his lyrics are just smart. Favorite tracks - 4. d.b. Cooper, 6. Keep Off The Grass, and 10. Just In Case. Those are the ones that jumped out at me when I got the record, but I have a feeling that I'm going to wake up and discover other gems on this album. Trivia... This record is released on John Prine's label Oh Boy records and Wayne Jackson of the Memphis Horns plays on several songs.If you get the chance to see Todd Snider live, go. After you seem him live, you will buy this record."
5,Todd Snider Smokes!,"I just heard him for the first time last night LIVE at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven CT opening for John Prine. He was fantabulous! Couldn't wait for the intermission to run to the lobby to buy this CD. A wonderful blend of humor and storytelling lyrics...the kind that make your feet want to get up and move! ""Just in Case"" was written for his friend in Oregon who was marrying a girl he had only known 3 months and Todd was asked to sing at the wedding AND write a song just for them. When his friend mentioned that they had a pre-nuptual agreement, Todd wrote this one. If you love John Prine, you will love Todd Snider, too."
4,If you're just happy to be here....,"then you too will be happy you're a Todd Snider fan. I believe he will be ""The Jimmy Buffet"" for the new century.I've been a fan since '95 and can't wait for each album. The lyrics are thoughtful, funny and sincere. Catch a live performance if you can. Todd's energy on stage rivals Buffett's but with a ""rock-a-billy-blues"" beat instead of calypso. Spread the word...Jimmy's proven you don't need MTV!"
2,Poor,The Kirkus Review above says it all about this book and in particular its author. The reason Irving has never been considered a serious historian is books like these.
1,Revisionism at work,"I think Publishers Weekly's review (March 25, 1996) of this books says it best. ""This is a repellent book, and not only because of its subject."" It's quite clear that Irving venerates, if not worships most of the Nazi leaders. It seems that Irving has chosen to use Goebbels as the scapegoat for the evils that the Nazi regime, and particularly Adolf Hitler perpetrated. If you look closely at his sources, particularly any information taken from newspapers that Goebbels had published, many come into question. It is sad that many people may accept this work as true history rather then the biased work that it is."
1,A Master of Inclusion and Exclusion,"Irving took me in once. I gave GORING a good review on the face of what seemed to be in depth research, and overlooked that which was left unsaid. Having now read GOEBBELS, I understand his methodology. He includes enough to reel in the unwary, but leaves out or glosses over that information which would indict the guilty. This book is a perfect example of that technique. Irving uses it, as he did GORING, to infer that Hitler, and most of the German military and civilian population, just weren't aware of the atrocities at the concentration camps.Shame on you, David Irving!"
2,"its fiction, not history","Unfortunately, this interesting bit of history relies on fictional details to support its larger claims. There is documentation about the falsities in this volume that came to light at David Irvings libel trial in London that removes any value to this book other than the interesting and fascinating way that Mr. Irving is able to weave his stories. If you like other WWII fiction you might enjoy this. If you are looking for REAL history then you are better off reading Goebbels diary entries in their original German than relying on David Irvings misguided attempt to channel the Third Reichs thinkers in this book."
4,Good show.,"Like some other reviewers, I've always been fascinated by the concept of time travel. That's perhaps the first reason this series appealed to me.The there was, of course, that it IS ""The Outer Limits,"" the best use of Sci Fi as a story/mythtelling means I've ever come across.This has a lot of elements you'd like in a story, a certain degree of sentiment, history, in short, humanity.Indeed, the spouse and I enjoyed ""Gettysburg"" after we returned from another weekend in Gettysburg.I recommend it."
5,time travel at its best,"for someone who enjoys the concept of time travel what a wonderful diversion from everyday life. the series is great because depending what you like robots, androids time travel you can find it on one of these very affordable dvs. the storys are entertaing and have quite a cast of people i would highly recommed this dvd for anyone that enjoys shows like the twilightzone. the irony of tales from the crypy tales from the darkside and time travel sincerly christian john nielsen"
4,"Excellent, and intellectually challenging","These stories are very entertaining, and actually have an intellectual content, in sharp contrast to much of the pablum that exists on television these days. Some of these stories are truly excellent.""A Stitch in Time"" is a superb episode that satisfactorily addresses the paradoxes inherent in time travel, and tells a compelling yarn to boot. ""Patient Zero"" is a suspensful and touching story that also deals with the paradox of time travel.""Gettysburg"" is a good story, but was too political for my taste. ""Tribunal"" was simply excellent.This collection is several cuts above what one normally finds on television, and successfully upholds the reputation of ""The Outer Limits"" both the original series and this new series, in that regards. This DVD is a terrific entertainment value to which the discerning viewer will repeatedly return."
3,deal with this seller at your own risk,"This product seems nice - exactly what I was looking for, but I purchased it and waited and waited and waited. Amazon alerted me about a week and a half later that I should contact them about my order because they had not received shipping confirmation. I e-mailed them and got a letter back stating simply to call them later that week. Having gotten no explanations or apologies I declined to call. They canceled the order a few days after that. I don't know what the people at Allergy Be Gone are up to, but they don't seem interested in customer service."
2,Honest review,"I purchased this item several months ago and I waited and waited as other reviewers have stated. When it arrived, it was in horrible condition and was actually a ""full mattress allergy cover"". I tried to wrap by body pillow with it, but no luck. I sent it back to the company and reviewed the purchase as poor. I was later contacted by the company and told they would only process my refund (they were in fact out of the body pillow covers and maybe thought I wouldn't know the difference?) if I took down my low rated review of their sale. I am absolutely horrified by their customer service and now wish I would have left the bad review up even if it cost money. Buy safe through another company..."
5,"Relevant, thought-provoking, and impossible to put down","""The Beirut Conspiracy"" by John Childress is an incredibly relevant and thought-provoking novel that strikes close to home for all citizens of the world. The plot, characters, and message are well designed, developed, and expertly delivered by an author who possesses Tom Clancy-like ability to research his subject and present it from an insider's point of view. The novel drew me in immediately with its believable story line and refused to let me go until I completed the incredible, but potentially possible, journey. ""The Beirut Conspiracy"" is one of the best novels I have read in many, many years. Mr. Childress appears to have found his literary ""groove"" and I eagerly look forward to his next adventure."
4,Wacky but that's the part that makes this book good,"i know some people may say popular is a dumb book, with dumb characters and stuff that is way too weird in high school.but i like it.this story is original and i like it as it's way too funny.it is also good in a way that they touch on some important things that happen in a normal teenager's life.Read it,i gurantee it's good"
4,"Would get a five, except for......","It is too wide to fit on the back of a standard bedroom door!I am going to try shortening the dowels (including the pre-drilled ones at top & bottom) so that it will fit on the back of my door. I admit it's my fault for not measuring my door. The item description DID list the dimensions. BUT...I think this part of their description: ""Hangs flat on a doorback, then move to table with easel design"" needs to include the fact that it is wider than a standard door.Other than that, it's nice & compact & will hold a lot of ribbon!!Edited to add: It was very easy to take it apart and shorten the width. I had to unscrew the top & bottom dowels and cut a few inches off each dowel. It now fits the back of my doors nicely!"
1,RIBBON AND WRAP UN-ORGANIZER,It was not very strong and while putting it together the wood split at the screws and it wobbled. It was not painted completely either.. It is big and ackward and not user friendly. The rolls of paper hit each other not allowing them to spin.
3,"Great idea and design, poor workmanship","We didn't really see anything else like it out there and ordered the organizer based on the design. It's all wood and looks like it would have been easy to put together if it were not for the poor workmanship. There were half a dozen or more holes in the wrong places that were filled back in with inserts. Several of them happened to be where screws were supposed to go so when you srewed them in, the inserts popped through. We were going to send it back but instead found some large washers to cover up the holes and to keep the inserts from pulling through. There were also numerous cut marks on one rail that matched the opposing rail's design. Looks don't really matter to us since it hangs behind the door."
1,COCKROACH POOP ON / IN ITEM WHEN RECEIVED!!!,"I ordered the RIBBON AND WRAP ORGANIZER: The product arrived in plastic wrap. After, unwrapping, I discovered that there was ""COCKROACH POOP"" on the item especially where there were grooves for the dowels to fit in.Also, it was obivious that wood putty had been put in one board as both ""legs"" had been the same at one time.The board had cracks in them also along with an inferior paint job.I called the number on the enclosed flyer, 877.943.5338 twice and was told to call 800.353.3300 .... WHICH WAS A ""PORN"" PHONE SITE!!!!!!Again, here are the problems: COCKROACH POOPPUTTIED BOARD TO COMPLETE PRODUCTBAD SANDING JOBBAD PAINT JOBCRACKS IN BOARDSCALL TO # ON ENCLOSED FLYER SENTME TO PORN SITE.I AM VERY UNHAPPY TO SAY THE LEAST AND WANT A FULL REFUND!!!"
1,Moldy & Warped,"The product arrived and the white-painted wood pieces were warped and moldy. It was poorly constructed with die-punch marks piercing supporting beams. I wrote to the manufacturer with no response. It would have cost money to send it back and since I didn't hear from the manufacturer, did not want to invest more money into the $29 item."
1,MOLDED!!!,"I purchased this product and when it arrived it was completely molded & the paint was chipping. I called the company and they promptly sent me a new one, however, it was also molded and chipped so I wouldn't recommend this product at all!"
4,"IT FUNCTIONS, BUT IT LACKS APPEAL",The ribbon/wrap organizer functions as it should.....so long as you don't put too much heavy ribbon on one rod and all....It does serve its purpose but it really isn't feasable to hang it on the door as it is too wide. If you don't mind it being free standing (which they don't show that it can do so but it does just fine)then it will work well for you. You could also hang it in a spare closet on the closet rod if you had the space. My only issue is that it comes outta the box looking outta sorts...It looks pretty cheap and the paint job isn't so great....but it does serve its purpose so long as you're not hanging it on a door....It's too wide for a regular door. We actually figured out a way to make it double sided and ran rods down the other side as well to maximize its functionality.
2,Not very sturty,"This product dose do what it is intend to, however it is very poorly made. The dowels where warped when I got it in the mail and is not at all sturdy."
2,Okay,I returned this product. It didn't work well for my needs. It wasn't well made and it had a icky smell.
5,RIBBON AND WRAP ORGANIZER,"You can not believe how wonderful this product is!!!! I hung it up, inside the closet door. Keeps all my ribbons and paper off the floor and easy to get to... LOVE IT !!!!!! Had to modify it a little, due to it being a little wider then the door.... but, it was easy to do...."
5,love it!,i bought this for my first feature film and it's very good. if anything it picks up too much sound so you have to be mindful of indoor/outdoor settings and really place it close to the actor(s). it uses one battery and it lasted me all summer. i've never used a boom mic before but while we were editing we found that the sound is really true.
2,Not as good as lead to believe.,"For the price, this shotgun mic seems like a good deal, but the sound quality is sub-par. The signal and range from the mic being very weak and very short, despite installing a fresh battery. (My mic arrived with a battery already installed!) Also, the lack of a phantom power option is VERY disappointing.Another disappointment was that the mic I received had been used. The box had torn open by some previous owner. The documentation was missing as was the shockmount, and mic clip that was supposed to be included. Mic was covered with greasy finger prints, and a battery had been left in it.I will be returning this ""USED"" item, to buy something better."
3,Good Debut,"This is a good debut outta shade sheist. I suggest this for any west coast rap fan. Some of the standout songs are: Act Like You Know Me, John Doe,Walk A Mile, Stop... And Think About It,Money Owners, Here I Come. Some of the songs that i don't like are: Wake Up, Cali Diseaz, and Where I Wanna Be."
5,Don't know bout anyone else but...,"This Cali cat comes a lot hotter than I expected from reading the other 4 reviews.. They don't do it justice, or for that matter really explain how good it is.He's cool. He's layed back, along with the bass heavy smooth beats.. They're cool aswell, Dammizza (his bro) really shines on the production. It's not slow but not club rap.. It's just cool, I love it. Ever since I got my 1st rap Cd, 3 1/2 years ogo, I've been lookin for a Cd like this.. I have over 300 in my collection (mainly west coast). I can't recommend it enough to anybody who loves tha West Coast flavour.So what if there's loads of guests?? In my book it's a plus!! O.k i'm not from the U.S let alone the west coast but I pride myself on only having the smoothest & tightest rap AND hip hop (there is a difference!) in my rotation. This is exactly that.. A must."
5,Todd Finally Gets Conscious,"Well, we finally get to see Todd talk, the REAL Todd talk, for once. We get to see his powers, which I won't spoil, but in my opinion are the most helpful outside of warfare. We also get to see not only baby Ed Beister, but Ashley being taken away by the Omega's, but Jack actually says something constructive to Toni! It's one more book I can add to my favorites!"
2,I loved my Roomba. Until it died.,"I think for a robot, the Roomba did a nice job of picking up. I have a dog, and it was great for keeping up with the hair and the dirt he tracks into the house. I never had unreasonable expectations for it to do an impectible job, but I have to say it did better than I thought it would.So why the low rating? My Roomba died. After just 18 months! For $200, that is just criminal! My old stand up vacuum was given to me by my mom and was almost as old as I am. It still worked when I replaced it with Roomba. I called irobot and they said it was out of warrantly (1 year) and it could not be fixed.I loved my Roomba, but I wouldn't buy another without a longer warranty. It's just not worth the money if it won't last a few years."
1,Impossible to get repairs,"It works for about a year (my parents, and a friend also got ripped off,) and then something breaks that cannot be repaired. (They have no service centers.) If you contact customer service, they'll offer you a trade-in on a reconditioned one for about $95.00 plus shipping.Not worth it."
3,Its ok,"I thought this would free me from vacuuming, but I was wrong. Although the roomba works ok, it does not have the suction to do a really thorough cleaning job on carpets. But for in-between cleaning, its not bad. On tile floors, it works pretty good, as I would expect it would do on hard-wood floors as well. I've owned it for about two months, and used it maybe a half-dozen times. The best rating I can give it is an ""ok""."
1,Great - when it works.,"This was actually my second iRobot Roomba. The first one, the basic red model, just started stopping and starting and only going in small circles and shutting off, after we had only had it for about one-and-a-half months, just after the ""return"" date, of course. We bought it at Circuit City, who claims they fix all the products, but found out everything BUT Roomba products,which should have been my first clue. I ordered this one from Amazon, hoping I had just gotten a lemon. Once again, after about one-and-a-half months, it began appearing to charge; but after I turned it on, charge light would go back to red, like it hadn't been charged. I'm hoping Amazon will treat their customers better than Circuit City and either repair or refund. Not buying another Roomba though! Hoping the Sharper Image one is better. We have mostly hardwood floors too, so not like it was a difficult job."
1,"Good Concept, Poor Service and Durability","Bought a 4105 Sage as a gift for my wife. Worked great for 6 times. I called iRobot for service, they said send in the unit and charger. I'm still waiting for the replacement charger, it's been 2 months, every time I call they say they expect some next week. Slow boat from China. I notice Amazon is now selling chargers. Great priorities, iRobot. Nice people, nice concept, very poor service and product pipeline."
2,Slow Customer Service,"I ordered and received my Roomba Sage in early January. I received the product and the battery was damaged. After several calls and e-mails I finally was able to get them to ship me a replacement battery. I received the battery on 02-23-06 after waiting for the back order. Hopefully it is going to work to my satisfaction, time will tell."
4,good for light cleaning,"great product, yet it will not beat a good broom and mop. Its really great to run everyday to keep the floors clean. I really like it, it saves me time by not having to sweep everyday."
2,Does not last,At first I loved it then well the brushes quit turning. I had only had it for a year. The battery does not last either.
3,Much too choppy,"The short synopsis about this book intrigued me enough to purchase it. However, I was very disappointed in the story as I read. The storyline was wonderful, but the way the author would jump from speaking about one character in two - three paragraphs and switch to another was confusing. There should have been new sections started when a new character and scene were introduced.There were also grammatical errors, and instances where a character was renamed.I strongly believe that the book would have been much better if the above items were corrected. I sincerely hope that in her next endeavor, the author takes her time and review her work with a fine tooth comb."
1,Dissapointed,Ah I was very dissapointed in this book big time! I saw no plot in this book what so ever. It was long and extremely boring. Chapter after chapter of women just talking. The ending just ended that's it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I hate I have to give this book such a bad review I just felt it could of been a lot better... Sorry
5,Good leash,"This is a good retractable leash that works exactly how it should. It gives a good distance for my mini-schnauzer to roam, but I can lock it at a shorter length if I need to keep him close."
4,Great Insights,"As with any book that is written as a commentary or a study assistant, you should read the source of the commentary, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. I find the informatin in Mr. Nibley's book very interesting. It opened up some thought processes that have enriched my study of The Book of Mormon. I would highly Recommend it to all who seek to enrich their own study of The Book of Mormon."
3,Package Notes,"LATEST ENHANCED VISUALSAn armada of spacecraft has revealed new worlds beyond our imagination.

2,Destroys guitar dynamics,"I play guitar in a 3-piece rock band that plays weekend bar gigs. Have been playing for decades, and worked as a recording studio engineer for over 10 years. I bought this to replace a cheap 10-year-old Nady that had a glass of water dumped on it (bar hazard)The good news is that this unit has very little effect on the tone of the guitar. Maybe a SLIGHT bass roll-off, maybe not. The range is great, and I've never had dropouts.The bad news is that the bottom half of the dynamic range gets choked off by an expander. Sustained notes die WAY too soon...and not smoothly, but with a tremolo kind of in-and-out. Playing softly? FORGET IT. It takes so much signal to get through the expander that softly strummed notes sound like palm-mutes. Soft palm mute notes sound like....mistakes.so, if you play full-pick all the time (metal) this is very good. If you use any kind of dynamics, buy something else."
3,Tried to use w/DJ system,"I purchased this product, NOT for a guitar, but as a wireless transmitter/receiver to connect a DJ-style console to my home theater system, on the advice of a sound engineer who believed it would work. Despite his best attempts, we could not make it work satisfactorily. I had to return it, and got a very prompt refund by Amazon to my credit card a/c. In fairness, it is NOT intended to be used with turntables, but it was worth a try. If you are planning to use it with a guitar, I expect it works fine. Sadly, it wasn't right for my purpose. I was very impressed with the ease of printing out a return label, returning it to Amazon and getting notification that my card a/c had been credited. That certainly encourages me to buy products from Amazon. If anyone reading this knows of a way to make a wireless connection between turntables/mixer and a home theater, PLEASE let me know! Thanks!"
3,Problems...,"Boults tempos are fast, dry, but driven, it could be argued. The problem is that in the Rachmaninoff the Orchestra can't stay together for long -- every half minute or so the ensemble is all over the place. But if that does not bother you..."
1,not very good,I didn't care for it and can not tell anyone to buy it. It lacks editing and the grammar...I can't recommend it.This is a true story?
2,Not as good as everyoe says,"So I read a lot of the reviews and debated whether to order these or not. I am pregnant right now and obsessed with anything peach flavored. I love the Peach Rings that I buy fom the store, they are soft and the peach flavor is great and some people said in their reviews they were similiar, but they are not! When you open up the bag you are hit with an amazing smell of peaches, but the candy itself did not live up to expectation. To me they taste kind of rubbery and have an after taste that I don't really care for. They are not soft enough. The peach rings I usually buy also have a lil bit of a sour taste along with the sweet which I like. These are almost too sweet. I have this huge ziplock bag full of them and now I wish I would have just saved my money and bought a few packs of the peach rings I love. Not really worth it."
3,Not what I expected,"Now that I have developed a taste for peach gummies, and after experimentation, found the freshest, softest, most tasty example of this product apparently sold everywhere, I am disappointed with Amazon's version of the same product. The gummies arrived safely on time. No problem. Everything was the same until I bit into the first one. It looked the same, smelled the same, even tasted the same, but the texture was not soft, nor did it taste fresh. It seemed like this product had been on the shelves for months. I've had some that were harder, obviously old. But these gummies were unsavory simply because they were not fresh.I hesitate to want any more by the subscription method. I had chosen the seller that sent the best product, obviously Amazon did not choose MY choice. Please cancel this subscription. I want to receive my gummies from the vendor I know has a fresh product. Thank you."
1,Not the worst thing I ever tasted....,"BUT they leave one heck of a nasty after taste.In my own opinion these are very nasty taste wise.The gummi bears are very much better,though they are really chewy and make your jaws hurt after a few."
3,ok but could be better,"These candies are too sweet for me, and they aren't as soft as I thought they'd be."
3,Not fresh,"I love this candy and have ordered several bags with great results. However, this last shipment was stale and hard.This makes me consider not reordering."
4,"Not as fresh as I was hoping, but still good!","I got this 5-pound bag because free shipping and it was semi-cheap. Anyways, they are not as fresh as I thought they would be, but it isn't terrible that you can't eat them. Still a great value!"
5,Delicious but Addicting,"The title says it all. They are extremely delicious, but I had to keep pouring it into a smaller bag to prevent it from being consumed all in one night."
4,Just Peachy!,"These Haribo Peaches smell just like fresh-picked peacheswhen you open the bag and they taste good too. They'recoated with fine granulated sugar which makes them a littlesweeter than the traditional gummies, but these, along withthe Haribo Pink Grapefruit candies, are some of my favorites."
2,Monotony at its finest,"As if the repetitive lyrics were not enough, we have the monotone and overly emotional voice of lead singer Justin Moore. This is not worth reviewing, let alone purchasing."
5,AWESOME!!!!,i honestly think this is an AWESOME CD. i have been lucky enough to have seen these guys many times live and i continue to go to thier shows because they have such great songs. this cd is wonderful!!!! i would tell anyone and everyone to buy this CD!!! they are SUCH a nice group of guys and they play wonderful music and have wonderful voices! THEY ROCK!!!!
2,"Not real wood, doesn't survive shipping","Amazon has shipped me two of these cork bulletin boards this week, and both have arrived damaged; two different packaging methods, two different shippers.The frame of this cork board is not really oak as the description would lead you to believe, but a cheap plastic with oak-look coating over it. No wonder it breaks during shipping!On the plus side, the back is well constructed, with really nice hangers built into the frame. There is a template for marking your wall, and screws with wall anchors (extra one included). The back of the board is smoothly finished.If you can stand the imitation oak, and the bulletin board arrives safely, it has the potential to be a 4-star item (real wood = 5-star). I may have to go shopping for another brand locally."
3,Needs a Better Editor,"There's a lot of good info in this book...it is unfortunately hidden among the many sidetrips the author takes. I agree with some of the other reviewers who commented that the book spends too much time comparing Aikido to other things. Piano, motorcycle riding, and even trucks taking curves are all provided as not just examples, but lengthy and unnecessary examples. Halfway through the book you haven't even learned one basic Aikido technique!I also had a hard time following many of the instructions and illustrations.On the plus side - the book does cover basic techniques and offers some memory tools to remember the Japanese terms. The section on rolling is excellent, and there's some good info in here about muscle tightness and how to deal with it.Overall rating: 3 stars. Could have been much better with a more rigorous editor."
5,Help with AIKIDO,This an excellent book to help with learning aikido. We give a copy to every new student who joins our dojo to supplement our classes and expand the student grasp of knowledge.
5,Proper Mindset,"Just the first chapter makes the whole book worth while. The Q&A is funny and at the same time very educational. It deals a lot with the proper mindset regarding the study of martial arts and the fact that aikido is more than self-defense. The section on basic exercises help a lot, as does the one on memorizing technique names, which can be difficult if a person does not speak Japanese. Much importance is placed on Ukemi (the art of falling), something which a lot of students ignore or dislike. Overall, I could not recommend a better book for all beginners (regardless of how many years they have been at it)."
4,Along the Tracks,"In my opinion, Along the Tracks is a good book. You find yourself on the edge of your seat numerous times, not to mention not being able to put the book down. Along the Tracks also has a very happy ending, which I happen to like."
5,It was one of my favorites on PBS.,I have been checking for this mini series for years. I am asking that this series PLEEEEASE be released. Diana Rigg was terrific (even more that usual) in this series. Hope someone is listening to all of us who want Mother Love released soon!
4,Terrific drama - about time we had a DVD release!,"Probably one of the best mini series on the BBC in 1989. This is a taut, psychological thriller staring David McCallum and Diana Rigg. It's too bad it was never released on DVD but perhaps now is the time!! Adapted from Domini Taylor's novel (same name) this is a neat, scary story done by some great actors. Can't recommend it enough..."
1,Not What I Am Looking For,"Many years ago when I worked in a movie theater there was an incredible film by Walt Disney Productions of the Grand Canyon with the music of Ferde Grofe's Grand Canyon Suite. It wss beautifully done and I have looked for it on DVD for several years to no avail. I was told it was available at Amazon, but that turned out not to be true."
2,"Great music, but not a great recording","From other reviews, I was hoping for a better recording. I don't think it was worth making a high res 5.1 release of this album. Perhaps I'm learning that Naxos is not the record label for my tastes."
1,SCAM DVD!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"So I bought this DVD with the idea that it would be like other orchestral videos where cameras pan the orchestra, conductor, etc... NOT SO - this is a total scam DVD - basically no different than a CD. Each movement track has a boring still picture that lasts the entire movement without change - and to top it off it's a very unimaginative performance... Of course because I have opened it I am probably not allowed to return it either - if that is the case, thank God I'm only out about $12... Unfortunately at this time there does not seem to exist a DVD of an orchestra playing the famous music of Ferde Grofe. I have a feeling that the other Naxos DVD's are made in this way too - be careful before buying a DVD from Naxos - they need to advertise much clearer. A fine recording of this work can be found in the CBS Masterworks CD recording with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Phil."
4,"Excellent function, but definitely not black","I purchased this product instead of the kit: paint, tape and ties. I ended up purchasing both the ties and paint separately. This tape looks good on the bike pipes, and is easy to work with. But after 2 weeks I ended up heat painting them flat black anyhow. Looks flippin fantastic now. highly recommended!Save yourself the trouble, and buy the kit up front. You will probably need it!"
5,Almost an erotic experience,"In my humble opinion, Haribo Peaches are dangerous. Don't eat them if you're celibate. Consuming these sweet-and-sour gummy peaches is almost an erotic experience. Being a sober-minded gentleman past my prime, I usually avoid them.Except as a guilty pleasure, of course!Eating them after devouring a Red Bull energy drink is especially sinful. Abstinence is a virtue, citizens of Alpha Prime. You have been warned."
3,Not a substitute for Peach Rings,"I love the gummi peach rings that you can find in most grocery stores, and thought that this was the same thing. It's not. They are very squishy, and really sugary."
5,A Great Book !!,"What can I say 400 pages full color for only [$$$], in todays RPG market that's a great deal. Well layed out easy to find information. An excellent job bringing Norrath to the table top. Can hardly wait to see more. Thanks SSS !!"
1,WARNING,"Warning to those who have or are thinking of ordering this book. I just received mine and it has duplicate pages in it in addition to about 30 missing pages that contain the bulk of the character classes. Other than this small but impossibly large problem, the book is OK, just wish I knew something of the classes available to play. The binding is typical of White Wolf studios. Sub-Standard."
4,Fun at both ends!,"This particular turtle is full of surprises. When the turtle sticks it's head out of the shell, you find a first surprise coming out. It's everything a kid would want to know about turtles.If that isn't enough, you should see what fun comes out of the tail. It's the cutest rhyming turtle-tales!Take into account the turtle, and the two books, and you find that this turtle heaps on a pile of fun!"
5,Good old music,This is the way I grew up listening to country. Every Saturday night in front of the old radio listening to the Grand Old Opry.
5,"Just buy both, if you can","This is a great recording of the work and so is Ancerl's on DG. Ancerl's is out of print. This one probably will be in minutes. The Requiem is so rarely recorded it's not worth fussing or nit-picking about one or another of two untoppable, excellent--but old--recordings. I just encountered the same problem with recordings of Franck's The Beatitudes, bought the only two recordings I could find, and lamented the fact that one was already out of print and the other wouldn't last forever. Both are great in their own ways."
4,NICE CURL-UP ON THE COUCH AND WATCH A ROMANCE MOVIE,"Jeffrey Nordling did such a great job as FBI Agent Larry Moss on Day 7 of the tv show 24 that I wanted to see more of his work and ordered this movie off Amazon. I really enjoyed it. I don't usually like ""cutesy"" movies but the chemistry between Jeffrey and Valarie Bertinelli was great and the kids were good. It had a lot of humor and the storyline was really good. I recommend this for anyone who is in the mood for a nice romance with a sexy leading man who has more depth then just some pretty boy."
5,Wilderness Love,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Good for all members of the family. I would recommend this movie to everyone who like good family entertainment. This dvd was ship on time and I received it in a less than a week of my order.
2,Wilderness Love,Good movie and very difficult for me to locate. Good acting and interesting to watch.
4,Family entertainment at its best.,This is such a nice Family movie. So moving. Love surely endures. The scenery is breathtaking.
5,What's not to like?,"What is not to like about anything Valerie Bertinelli is in? This is sweet, charming and thoroughly predictable. But I enjoy every minute of it every time I watch it!"
2,dougv,"A very poor movie. It's slow moving and has a dull plot. Much of the film couldhave been edited out.There's really nothing worth seeing in it. I shut off my VCR after about30 minutes,Not a film to buy."
5,A Must have acoustic version,"David Gray's first single off his new album ""Life in Slow Motion"",is great as it appears on the album.But for fans who are having a harder time adjusting to his ""Dylan Gone Electric"" sound, this is the version for you.""The One I Love"", acoustic version, gives you vintage Gray.A man and his guitar,pouring out his emotions,and giving the die- hards a glimpse of what could have been had he stayed the course.The other 2 tracks are worthy B-sides,but the title track is the definite stand out here.I personally love the new album,and recommend it to all David Gray fans,new and old.But i think this single will help make the hold-outs transition a little smoother.Stop fighting it and buy this single."
4,"Easy listening, soothing melodies","I recently purchased this CD and think that it is a good collection of soothing melodies. I don't understand the commentsfrom the previous review, about the off-key piano. It seems unlikely that he has the disk; it is a collection from 6-7 previous CDs. So, I guess the piano must have been off-key on all those recordings. Looking at the reviews from those other CDs, however, it doesn't appear that anyone else had a problem with the piano."
5,For the Memories,His music relaxed me. It is soothing to help with studying for a test and driving in stressful trafficLove it
1,"Beautiful Arrangements, All Off-Key","I wish I hadn't bought this CD; the piano he used is out of tune. I would think that when a person goes to the trouble of recording a CD, all the instruments would be in tune. The piano grates on your nerves! Some of his arrangements, such as ""The Rose"", are drop-dead gorgeous, but neglecting to tune the piano is a big dud with this discriminating listener!"
2,Average Letters of Recommendation,"The book was only marginally helpful. The letters suggested were not original in presentation.My suggestion is to use this book if you have no idea how to write a letter of recommendation.This book wil not help you take your letters up a notch, which was what I wanted."
2,Write Letters of Recommendation for HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS,"I was somewhat disappointed because the title of the book was misleading. As an employer looking for ideas to write a letter for an employee, this book was of no help. Also, I doubt the examples provided in this book would be helpful for a college student looking to get into graduate school, for example.This book is excellent for HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS looking for examples they can tailor for HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. Outside of this small audience, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone."
4,A book every teacher should have who writes reccomendations.,"Thanks to ""How to Write A Powerful Reccomendation"" I was able to compose a series of letters, each unique and creative, for my students which were strong enough to get each and every one of them into their top choices. I look forward to your next book Ms. Whalley."
4,How to Write Powerful Letters of Recommendation,I needed help with writing a strong letter character. This book provides ample amount of example to work with. It was easy to take from one letter sample and add to another to produce a strong letter for any occasion.
2,Uneven fit,I bought these sheets in lilac and pink. The colors are very pretty and they look good in the crib. The problem is they don't fit over all 4 corners of the mattress. I never knew changing a sheet could be so difficult. I have broken fingernails and scrapped knuckles just from putting on these sheets. At first I thought all sheets were supposed to be this tight until I tried a bedding set sheet which goes on easily and covers all 4 corners and sides. The Koala Babys aren't big enough to tuck under. You can see the bottom of the mattress on one side and I worry that the sheet might slide up. I won't even bother using them anymore.
2,The red sheet bleeds really badly,"I have the red sheet for my son's room. I washed it in cold water and it bled all over the laundry in the washing machine, ruining several things. Granted, red items tend to run but this was unlike any red thing I've ever washed. It was all over everything! Then after washing it and putting it on the crib mattress, the sheet still bled onto my sons clothing when it got wet from spit up. This sheet has ruined 3 different outfits because it is impossible to get the red stain out. It's really dissapointing because so far, it's the only brand of bedding that I've found that has bright, primary colors and I'd like to continue using it. Everything else about it is great, I'm sure the other colors are fine."
1,CHEAP!,I prewashed this sheet in a gentle cycle and the corner seams seperated (the stitching came out). I felt this was unsafe for my mattress since it wouldn't be strong enough to hold and with another wash I'm sure all the stitching would come apart.
1,Too much shrinkage,"I love the fabric of these sheets, and love the lilac cover. However after several washings they don't fit the mattress well (I'm also using the ultrasoft mattress pad). The corners barely fit over the mattress and the sides do not cover the mattress at all. I won't use them anymore because they aren't safe. Instead I bought the kind of sheet that slips over the mattress like a pillowcase from JR safetysheets."
1,Runs color - Don't buy,"I bought a navy blue koala crib sheet from babies r us. Unfortunately, I washed it with a regular load of laundry. It turned all the other clothes blue; so blue that I couldn't get the color off even after soaking the clothes overnight in bleach.It seems that this manufacturer has no quams about selling bad quality stuff for babies."
2,An OK Car Seat,This Car Seat was purchased as a replacement for one involved in an auto accident. The original was a Safety First model. I purchased the Eddie Bauer model thinking it would be a little bit nicer because it was more expensive. The fabric felt very thin and the padding did not cover the enitre seat. I returned the car seat and bought a seond Safety First model.
5,GREAT!!!,I heard about this special. Wanted to see it. Thank you Amazon. Mr. Taylor is wonderful. It is great!!!
2,Program description not accurate.,It stated that it is a sequel in the program info and it was just a documentary on where the stars and show props are today. Was interesting but got credit back and didn't finish watching all of it as it got boring.
3,I suppose I needed to watch it!,"HG Wells lived just up the road from me (in Eltham / Bromley, SE London - albeit in a different era!)...reading his complete book of short stories when I was a teenager blew my tiny little mind.........'A Story of the Days To Come' and 'The Time Machine' had some sort of imprint-type influence on my general outlook....The original movie had no less than the same impact....the manniquin scene saved me a fortune on clothes as well; but I digress.I thought anything with the original actors and machine had to be watched - As long as you're not expecting a full-blown movie production, then you'll not be let down.....I would have preferred to have watched this for free on amazon Prime, but paid the $1.99 and got on with it......'The Journey Back' is really something you'll only want to watch if you loved the original (1960) Time Machine movie......and again, don't expect great things!!"
5,Therapist Marketing,"It is probably true that many therapists are not knowdgeable about marketing. The sample advertisments were excellent providing the basic material to commence thinking about strategy. Whilst I did expect to see finished layouts, the advertising content was included and would only have to be formatted into a completed advertisment. I was able to put my own touch on the layouts.Jeremy Castelino"
3,Geography becomes data mining for the Feds,"While I applaud the efforts of these geographers to bring geography back to life at the USGS, their recommendations essentially confirm what niche, I believe, American geographers now occupy: map technicians and data miners. A revitalized vision of geography as a profession within the Federal government is what the book shoots for. Unfortunately, geographic training typically emphasizes GIS courses. The field of American Geography divorced itself from being a player in ""big science"" long ago and this book is a meager attempt at catch-up for the next century. GISM for geographers who'll sit in front of screens while the land surface of the US gets chewed to hell by the powers that be. 3 stars for trying."
5,performed beautifully,"My history with leaking air matresses is legendary. However, the older one gets, the more one needs one while camping. I decided to give it one more try, and am really happy. On a week long roadtrip, the Intex was very comfortable. Didn't slide off it. On setup, it inflated easily in only a few minutes with the battery operated pump. Only topped it off once midweek. Deflation was instantaneous when the time came, due to a well engineered dump valve. Couldn't ask for more, especially for the price."
4,Worths the money,"First of all the air-bed is shipped by Fedex within 2 days. I have been using it everyday for about a month now and I had to fill it 4-5 times. Although at first it is an unusual feeling for people who are used to sleeping on a regular mattress, I think this air-bed is pretty comfortable and definitely worths the 25 + 6 dollars that I spent for the bed & pump + batteries. The pump is working with batteries but it seems like one set will last for a long time."
2,didnt stay filled,"Intex Queen Prestige Downy Airbed with Hand Held Battery Pump was a great product, but my bed didnt stay filled with air for my guest. I researched it and it said that sometimes it just happens. I am returning the product and buying a more expensive, higher quality product."
5,airbed,First time to use an airbed. I have three now. Just love them. Why did I not think of this before?
1,Comes with no manufacturer's warrenty,"We purchased this item in February 2011, we used it 5 times over a 19 month period to accommodate my 11 year old niece when she and her parents come to visit. The last time she was here, about a month ago, she woke up on the floor as the mattress had deflated. I checked for punctures and found none, I then did a water test looking for a pin hole leak and found none. I now suspect that the problem is a seam or at the air pump connector. I called the manufacturer and they advised me that they do not warrant air mattresses and suggested that I contact the seller, Amazon. I called Amazon to see if I could get an exchange or a refund and was advised that the return date for this item expired on March 2011, 30 days after purchase and that I was not entitled to an exchange or a refund even if the item was defectively manufactured.Intex Prestige Downy Twin Airbed Kit"
5,"Quick, easy and comfortable","Used the inflater for both the Intex and our older Coleman mattresses. Pump had adapters for both. The bed was very comfortable, (I am 6'2"" and 225 lbs) Held air very well and was not slippery at all. Easy to deflate at end of camping weekend."
1,Don't waste your money... Bed goes flat after a few uses,"We took this bed camping and used it for 3 nights. It was great! We set it up a month later for a sleep over and it went flat in the middle of the night. I thought perhaps we didn't plug it correctly, so we tried again the next night, again flat. There are no holes in the mattress but some how it won't hold air. There isn't a warranty on this product so we are out of luck."
5,Works Great!!!,"I bought this airbed for camping use. It worked very well! I've used other airbeds and they went flat after one night. This one, however, did not have to be re-inflated after the first night. Inflating and deflating the bed was very quick. The punp isn't very loud either. I am very satisfied with my purchase!"
3,Great for the price,Don't expect the best air mattress on the market for this price but it is very good. We got this for camping and overall it worked great.
4,Worth it...,"Bought this for my daughter to use. She found it comfortable. It was easy to fill once I figured it out, and very easy to deflate. Can't complain."
5,Good solid air mattress,"I use air mattresses for my normal bed, have for years. This one is nice and solid, and has a good valve that makes it easy to adjust. I didn't use the included battery operated one, as I have a wall powered pump, but the nozzles fit on the wall powered pump fine. Have used it for over a month, and it's nice and solid, only a little dip in the middle. Hasn't softened much due to stretching of the vinyl as a lot of them do. Am about to buy another one to have as a backup for when the cats finally kill this."
5,Great air bed,I used this air bed for a 6 year old. I couldn't be more happy with my decision! This bed is very durable and the included battery operated pump works great!
4,Much better than the previous air mattresses I bought on Amazon,"I originally bought the ""2PCS SINGLE SIZE AIR MATTRESS"" from Zaltana, here on Amazon. One of those leaked right out of the box, so I had to send them back (which was quite an ordeal).These ""Intex Prestige"" airbeds are far superior - no leaks (helpful!), sturdy construction, and fulfilled directly by Amazon rather than having to deal with a 3rd party who might not be as pleasant to deal with as Amazon itself.About the only slight negative on these airbeds is that they had a bit of an odd odor when first unpacked. I simply left them airing in an upright position for a day and a half and the smell disappeared.Do take notice of the size - these are wider than several other airbeds."
3,Not bad for the price,"We got rid of our guest bed and needed something to replace it for the times we do have guest over. After searching online for awhile we went with this bed because of the price mainly. It was easy to blow up after we figured it out, you have to take the plastic thing off the hole for the bed to really get the air in there. It held air all weekend for our guest which was great, no reflating it.Our guest said it wasn't the most comfortable mattress they've ever slept on and she was a small women and a 5 year old. But it gets the job done. I'm not sure yet how it will work with my husband and I sleeping on it during a camping trip, i'm worried it won't be as comfortable as i hoped. But for the price you can't get everything.The pump is useless to deflate it really, it's much easier to unplug it and press the air out yourself. I had it disassembled, airless and folded up in 5 minutes which wasn't bad."
3,6 C Batteries for air pump? WHT?,I haven't inflated it yet because the pump runs of 6 C-Cell batteries. Who the heck keeps those on hand? I haven't used a C-Cell battery since I had a toy light-saber when I was 10. Can't speak for the quality--seems good enough--but just be aware when you order it.
2,Not great,"I own another Intex bed, a queen that is also about two feet tall and is electric, and it works great.This one is not anything like that.First it requires batteries, which is fine. Except they are 4 D batteries, ouch.It fills up relatively fast, but does not hold air at all, and is extremely close to the ground. Every morning when anyone woke up from sleeping on it it would be half deflated.And it's also not very comfortable."
1,failed to last,My bed is failing. There are areas where the shape has become deformed. A large bubble now sticks up from the center of both the top and bottom. A second smaller bubble deformation is growing in one corner. Return policy is weak.
2,"bed doesn't stay inflated, not worth the money","I purchased 2 of these for my kids, they weigh 35lbs and 65lbs, when they lay on them, they start to loose air...not worth the money."
1,1-2 uses then doesn't hold air,"You may as well sleep on the ground, because you're going to wake up on it. This air mattress worked OK the first 1-2 times we used it, but then couldn't hold air for more than ~2 hours. Not recommended."
5,Does the job well,"Since this is a budget product, you are probably considering it for price. Well, add in the four large ""D"" batteries that you will need to buy for the pump.After that, you will wonder how it works. Pretty good, actually. It inflates quickly, keeps the sleeper off the floor, and seemed to hold well for the teenager I used it for. In other words, a good emergency unit. Of course it would have been better if it came with a plastic bag, but any cloth bag that you have or an old pillow-case will do as well."
3,Good for a few hours,"Bought this to use for a month while I visited my parents. Filling and emptying it was easy and fast. But for some reason after a few hours, i would wake up to it uncomfortably less deflated. Oh n if ur sleeping alone on it, u sure will feel the underside (the floor) either with ur butt or hip. It does the job for now, but I'd rather by a ""double decker"" one."
2,"2 and 1/2: sometimes good, sometimes bad","I bought two of these during the holidays last year, and have since used them 3 times for adults, no kids have been near them. They were on super sale and I think we got both for twenty bucks and planned to stack them for extra comfort. The first time, they were ok, they did need extra air added every day, but they stayed inflated. The same went for the 2nd time they were used.The third time didn't go so well. One of the mattresses completely deflated(with no one on it) within 2 hours. For the price, I'm not really mad, but I was disappointed. They are comfortable, but they require maintenance to keep them properly inflated during use, which is a pain in the neck. If I had to buy air mattresses again, I probably would avoid this brand."
4,Good for the Price,"Loses air a little bit over night, but seems more stable than air mattresses I have used previously. Included pump works good. Used for camping in the back of a van!"
3,Not Used Yet,Don't fill it up too full with air and it feels better. Not sure I like the long ribs and would prefer the waffel style pattern. The battery pump is necessary as it take a lot of air to fill it up. The price for the combo pf pump and airbed was great. I will try it out this summer.
5,3 Day Bed,This item was for a cancer patient who was doing the Susan G. Komen 3 Day walk. it arrived before the walk and provided her with a comfortable place to sleep at night after walking 20 miles each day.
4,GREAT PRICE,THE INTEX AIR BED KIT IS A COMPACT UNIT THAT FITS THE BILL FOR A GREAT PRICE.GRANDSON LOVES IT CANNOT WAIT TO GET OUT TO USE IT
3,so so,the mattress is greatbut! i got with it this very bad quick pump that killed batteriesi recommenced 2 buy a good pump with the matenjoy the out doors:-)
3,Works for a While,"I'm using this air bed as a regular bed. It's been about 4.5 months, and it has a leak somewhere.If I can patch it, it will be ok. Otherwise, it'll keep deflating faster and faster until it's unusable.If you're just using this bed for camping, it'll be fine. For use as your bed at home, it doesn't cut it.I've had similar problems with another air bed. My suggestion would be to get a futon mattress instead if you're looking for something that might last longer. Personally, I'll probably buy 2 air beds over the course of the next year and then buy a futon when I find a more permanent apartment."
3,in box,"still have not used, per other reviews and cost was the reason i went with this product, hope it lives up to its positive reviews"
4,"Perfect, comfortable, but....","I love it, I bought this a few weeks ago because I recently relocated and have no furniture at all, I thought of getting this for urgent need, but planned to replace it as soon as I found the perfect apartment for me.. however after spending a couple of nights sleeping on it I realized I'm gonna give priority to other things my apartment needs, because this bed is very comfortable, surprisingly comfortable and easy to set up.. my complains about it are simply that the marks along it can be annoying some times, but if you inflate it properly you won't feel them at all, also I noticed that it deflates a little big after a couple of days of use at first, you only need to inflate it a little bit and it will be perfect, and after a few times of this it will stop deflating completely."
2,I took my chances...,"I had pretty low expectations and I wasn't dissappointed. It never inflated all of the way for reasons I couldn't fiqure out. The pump that comes with it has such a low pressure of air coming out I felt like I could have blown it up faster. I laid around on it for an evening and it was okay, though I was afraid to move to much for fear of it would just collapse under my weight (which is just 118). I actually purchased it for overnight guests on Xmas but suspect that after a 250lb man spends the night on it, it won't last very long. But in the products' defense I got what I paid for and I knew that going in."
3,Better Options,"This is a comfortable bed that is easy to put up and take down, BUT the charge requires C size batteries - 6 of them. This is another $15 buck on top of the cost. If I were repurchaseing I would probably purchase one that was $20 more expensive but self inflating."
2,"Little support, long inflation time","I'm 200 lbs and 6 ft. For me this mattress simply does not provide enough support, and I've awoke with an aching back after each time I've used it. What's frustrating is that the included, battery-operated inflation device seems to blow the mattress up only so much; in my estimation only about 90% of what would be adequate for sufficient firmness. So for me this purchase is a bust and I'm going to see what I can do to send it back."
1,"leaks, leaks, leaks","After Katrina we lived on air mattresses for a good six - eight months while we rebuilt our home. One eventually developed a leak but we had a bouncy four year old on rough concrete floors. We were impressed that it had lasted as long as it did.Now, we are moving out of state. My husband and son left first with all the furnishings and I stayed to fulfill work obligations. I purchased two Intex queen size camper air mattresses. I decided to double stack them for a more comfortable level of sleep. It didn't hurt that they were on clearance either.They both get soft during the night. Very disappointing. These fall under the category of nonreturnable once they've been used. Glad they were cheap but I got what I paid for when I bought these - something cheap. Disappointing."
2,did not last too long,i went camping with this product months ago but had to use it at home when friends arrived to spend the weekend the air did not last through out the night.
3,Figures...,"I am not really surprised, but after 5 days of use it was flat. If it was punctured I have no idea how, or why, as I didn't move it and I was the only one using it on a living room floor. The inlet valve is weird, it could be the culprit.But the days it did hold air it was comfortable. It didn't feel cold on top like other flocked air mattresses I've used.So I would tell a prospective buyer to go ahead and buy this for a temporary bed, but don't expect to store it and reuse in the future. I guess I was expecting a little too much for less than twenty bucks."
4,Air Bed,Took it camping and worked well. Yea you do have to fill it with air every/everyother night because it does lose some air. All of them do due to stretching this one might leak a little. But for the price it served its purpose well. Used it 4 nights camping 2 at home for guest/
1,"first one went flat, exchanged second one went flat",I wouldn't bother with this again. save the hassle and spend a little more on a decent folding cot. more comfy and even the expensive airbeds have too many reports of flats.
3,get what you pay for,"I like everything about this air mattress except that when u wake up in the morning u may or may not b on the ground due to deflation. Some nights it stays full, sometimes it does not. I like that it came with a battery operated pump. Most do not."
5,Amazing,I ordered because of the bed I was sleeping on was very uncomfortable and when I got it and used it for the first time I slept like a baby
3,good quality for the price,"i bought this product for the first time through amazon, but I had the same one a year ago from a store. I liked the feel of the bed while laying on it, and the fact that it didn't warm up and trap heat like the others i tried. but ofcourse u need to be careful not to put too much pressure on side of it, or it will start leaking air. It is not the highest quality there is , but certainly has a good price-to-quality ratio."
4,Good bed for the price.,"The bed airs up very quickly, and I found the pressure to be sufficient. You do have to hold the battery pump to it, as it doesn't fit perfectly (or didn't for me, anyway), but that's no big deal, and it fills very quickly. However, it takes 6 C batteries -- NOT D batteries as the description says. I was a little annoyed to have ordered D batteries for nothing. Learn from my mistake. lol"
1,Pump Useless,This product was very disappointing. The pump would not work unless you held it at a certain angle. When holding it at an angle the pump would eventually stop. Very frustrating to use. I took it back. Would not recommend this product at all!!!
3,great pump crappy matress,"I got this mattress cause of all the good reviews. If you just need it for around the house and for one person, it would probably be fine but its just not tough enough for camping and for 2 people. I used it in the back of my van and it had a hole in it within a week. Also befor it had a hole it still seemed to loose air. But the pump is great, definately worth the $25. So i just figure i bought the pump and got a free matress out of the deal. someone said it only takes four pumps before the batteries die but i used it alot more then that and it didn't die. I think that person just had crappy batteries."
3,"Good bed, terrible pump.","The mattress itself is very comfortable, though the ridges are a bit high. If you buy this be prepared to fork out more money to buy a decent pump. The included pump seriously sucks. Even with brand new batteries, it isn't able to fully inflate the mattress."
2,Just so so,Good Inflate very quick. But it has a bad smell of plastic. It smells very bad and I put it out for two days and the smell still does not disperse. Do not know what to do with it.
4,"Nice, Cheap, Comfortable and worth it.","I bought this to have in Iraq since Army mattresses pretty much suck. Well this little number is really easy to inflate and very comfortable. It inflates very quickly with the included pump. The only negative thing about this is that the quick release cap can pop off when the mattress is fully inflated and happens to rub up on something like the edge of the bed frame. Not a problem if you plan on using it on the floor for camping or a flat bed with no bed frame that stands above it. It is very cheap even with the delivery fee and even arrived within 9 days all the way to Iraq! The material seems durable and so far it only seems to need a slight refill every few days, but I am a big guy and that could be the reason why it looses a little air."
1,Leaked air-- was unuseable,"I pumped this mattress up and it leaked a considerable amount of air within 1 hour, I also have a Coleman mattress and it holds air and is a lot thicker construction. Don't buy this one."
3,Just soso!,"The air pump along with the bed is not good, since it is electronic pump, the bed cannot be filled with enough air pressure, have to buy another manual one instead!"
1,did not hold air,"Bought this air matress for our big vacation to Sturgis South Dakota, did not hold air for even two hours, really ruined the first night, got another one the next day that worked. Don't waste your money."
2,not very pleased,"Just received this air mattress. Bought it to stage my house for selling.....needed a bed for the second bedroom. I bought a steel frame and put this air mattress on it. It's not even close to being a queen size. The box claims it to be 60x80. I measured 54x76, and that's being generous. And it wouldn't inflate completely. About 90% like one other person described. It's only for looks at this point, but I planned on using it to sleep on for a few nights when I move. Not sure that's going to happen. Can't decide if I should keep it or not. But I wouldn't recommend it unless your only other choice was to sleep on the ground."
5,Great!,"This air bed works great! Make sure you do order the c batteries like the package says, not D batteries. We aren't going camping yet, so my son is using it on top of his bed. He weighs around 110, and it is super comfortable. The pump works quickly!"
4,it's an OK bed,I liked it. the pump worked very well. Filled the bed in about 3 or 4 minutes.It was comfortable to sleep on and very easy to drain and fold.I did have to add air again on the 2nd day.... hopefully it will work the next time I use it.
3,reasonably priced but shabby built plastic components,"This is basically bought for camping needs. It is sturdy in the sense that light, fast to inflate and holds air in well. I haven't tested it to for anything but a couple of hours so far and it holds air. The thing that irks me is that when I went to deflate it, pinching in the cap, one end broke off. FAIL. It still works but it just proves that you have to be careful of the plastic pieces when dealing with this item."
1,Battery-powered pump doesn't work.,"I see a couple of bad reviews about this product, but I find it fascinating that no one has complained about the fact that the battery-powered air pump is complete trash. It is as if I bought a toy version of it. I admit that the mattress looks really nice, and probably feels good to sleep on AFTER it is fully inflated, but what freaking good is it if the pump doesn't work? To make matters worse, I tried putting the damned thing back inside the box to return it, but the damned thing doesn't even fit back inside! By the time it is inside the box, there is no room to put the pump, and the box looks like it is about to explode.IMO, (even if for a measly $20), this product is NOT worth getting."
1,Looses Air,"I purchased this items after reading some of the reviews. Unfortunately I did not try out the mattress right away.So when I went on a camping trip, I was sad to find out that the brand new mattress looses air after every single night!!!It is fairly quick to fill the mattress, but very frustrating to do that for something brand new!I recommend spending more money and getting something that will actually work.There is no way for me to return this at this point, so this was a waist of money!"
1,"These use C batteries, not D!!","I bought this mattress for guests. After a long day of sightseeing,we discovered that the mattress I had procured for their use could not be inflated because it requires C batteries, not D batteries as described in the Amazon product blurb. And since there is no option to inflate using an electrical plug, we were left without a bed for my tired guests.I am extremely annoyed and can't believe that no one else has pointed this out yet!!! Very very disappointed."
4,Good product.,"I don't know about it's durability for camping. I really don't trust air beds for the outdoors. But, for an extra bed for guests; it's very good."
2,Uncomfortable and the battery burned through the bed after 1 use,"I purchased this bed for the half dome hike and the bed was uncomfortable. Not only that, the battery part burned after one use, rendering the whole thing useless. Buy at your own risk. I bought this bed at $25 and I guess that's the kind of product you can expect for that price."
1,It can not inflate enough!,"It can not inflate enough!It is not comfortable with sleeper. I feel bad after sleep on it for two night.It is no good, I don't know why it can not inflate.So, I decide return it finally."
4,"Good mattress, very poor instructions","We had this inflated for a few days without using it and it held the air well.The instructions are very poor. For example, we had to figure out by ourselves how to deflate the mattress. It tells you to ""attach nozzle if necessary"" but it does not tell you or show you that you must remove the cap on the mattress. And the rest of the instructions are equally useless."
3,Intex Prestige Air Mattress,"The good news is the mattress is comfortable, large enough and the battery pump works fine. Plus the price was OK. The bad news is that it had a slow leak right out of the box. It does not go entirely flat overnight so the battery pump is very handy."
2,Weak,"The product was priced very nice, but the pump is horrible and does not inflate the bed up all of the way. The bed also seems to release air in the middle of the night....I found myself having to pump the bed up after every night."
4,"Good, not great.","Good product for mildly dry skin. My skin becomes extremely dry and itchy in the winter, Nivea Milk and Apricot Foam Bath while helpful is not moisturizing enough for my needs. Would use during other seasons. Lightly frangranced, not too sweet or flowery"
1,Don't touch it,"I got it after losing a Motorols FRS radio (T5200) which was awesome. I am v e r y disapoointed by the Midland set. Among others, the mic sensitivity is adjusted differently in each set. if you talk to closely to the set it gets saturated and cuts the transmission. Poor product in comparison to Motorola."
4,Good value,Range is as stated on open land but batteries do tend to lose a lot of power quickly. A handy little unit.
1,Battery hungry,"Bought a pair after 911 in NYC because we always lost cell signals.The batteries run out so quickly even for FRS mode. I can't even try GMRS mode. The distance isn't impressive either. Thus, it was useless during summer blackout of 2003.No vibration mode thus my kid can't hear the ringtone in theme parks.Disappointed."
4,"A good book, with a lot of car history.","Thos book is a exellent maker- history encyklopedia, it contains information about modells as well as owner history. The one thing that would make this book perfect is more modell data."
3,An Underground Life: Memoris of a Gay Jew in Nazi Berlin,I enjoyed the writing. It was short and to the point. I had a problem with all the German term but anyone would. Great insight.
1,I doubt Mr. Seel's veracity,"Pierre Seel, I believe, has exploited the eagerness of publishers to publish any hair raisingputative holocaust tale without regard to fact checking or any sense of decency."
4,Amazing Underwater Universe,"This is a great, specializated guide with the best diving and snorkeling tours in the impressive Australian reef. Information about the best agencies, tours' schedules, instructors and amateurs courses and different submarines kinds that habitate the colorful coral world. An indispensable book for this magnific adventure."
4,Raynox - not perfect,"I have had the opportunity to try my new Raynox 2.2 conversion lens on my Panasonic Lumix FZ-20. The lens delivers clear, sharp photos, however, there is still some vignetting in the corners. I continue to try different settings to alleviate this problem, but have not had 100% success to date."
2,Fringing problem,I returned this lens because it had noticable green and purple fringing when used with my Sony F717.The definition was fine but the fringing was unacceptable. A minor irritation was that the back lens cap is not usable when the conversion ring is on.
5,Up Close and Personal,"Have purchased telephoto lenses before, only to be sorely disappointed because of the lack of light and subsequent underexposed photos. This one however, did not disappoint. It allows close up photos with excellent resolution, without losing any appreciable light. I recently took some close up shots of Lions at the zoo and you can see every hair and the glint of saliva on the mouth. It's a bit large, so a tripod is a must in my opinion, but it's certainly worth the trouble if you want a close up that will make you go ""Wow!"" Worth every dime."
2,Poor Audio Rendering,"This would be an excellent background music album if it wasn't for the harsh, unmusical sound in the highly modulated sections. This is most noticable in the RHAPSODY ON A THEME OF PAGANNI, all though it is throughout the album. It is similar to listening to music through speakers that are ""over driven"" or damaged.I had no problem with the inclusion of END CREDITS. I thought they worked well for background (as opposed to concert) music, as all the major themes of the movie can be reintroduced in the END CREDITS."
4,Some beautiful tracks,"There are some beautiful tracks on this compilation, particularly from Romeo and Juliet. A couple of tracks veer into the cheesy category, but a compilation beautifully played and well worth adding to any movie soundtrack collection."
2,Cheap Imitation,"This CD is not what it claims to be. It's the Scottish National Orchestra re-doing themes from several movies, and the themes have definitely lost their flavor -- not to mention their tempo. I'm very disappointed. When I want the soundtrack to something, I want the actual soundtrack!These are not bad renditions if you hadn't seen the movies -- but it's almost as bad as hearing a midi of some song you like: it's just what's on the page, not the incredible flavor of the version in the movie.Haven't been this disappointed with an album since my penny-pinching little brother bought me ""101 Strings Play Simon & Garfunkel"". ;)"
5,PAUL MITCHELL WORKED UP ROCKS!,"Take your hair from flat to fluffy in just a few sprays to the roots. I am addicted to this stuff! It gives me fabulous full hair without all the sticky flaky white crap that other sprays leave behind. It has an awesome scent that leaves a beautiful shine behind with no greasies! BUY-SALON the seller's, stand behind everything they send out and if there is an issue they will do all they can to make it right! They have the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE so if u have any questions feel free to contact them. This Paul Mitchell WORKED UP spray has kept me from getting a body perm for more times then i can count, because you can keep layering the spray to get the flexible hold and style you need. Try it you won't ever be without it again!"
2,Disappointed,"Being an Emergency Room Nurse, I bought this for our teenage drivers, knowing first-hand, sometimes you REALLY do need something like this to save your life. I was very disappointed. It's lightweight alright- because it is made of such cheap plastic that the grooves don't even align. Not only me, but 3 strong, muscled males tried to get the pin to pop with no luck. How sad to think this item could easily save a person's life, but when you needed it most, you lost a loved one or yourself because it didn't work. There should be a law against selling items such as these that were made to help, yet are made the cheapest to make a profit, not save a life. Buyer Beware!!"
1,Multiple Failures,"Imagine giving this device to your 16 year old. Imagine he encounters circumstances to put it to use. Now imagine it fails to work. How would you feel about your gift?I ordered 6 of these as Christmas stocking-stuffers. Fortunately, my 16 year old tested the glass breaking function of his on a piece of scrap hard plastic.No matter how hard we tried we couldn't get the pin to 'pop'. The barrel simply moved in and out with no effect.I handed him another. The pin popped as it should but then remained stuck in the extended position. In actual use that would have meant one try to break the glass and then the device would have been useless.I tested the remaining 4 and they did, in fact, function as advertised and demonstrated. I don't think a device like this ought to have what basically amounts to a 33% failure rate on the 6 I purchased.If you buy them, TEST them. Then consider installing the full-sized hammer as a back-up."
1,Hello? Did anybody try it?,"It is just amazing that so many people give the product 5 stars even when they have never used it. They seem to just assume it will work when their car is immerged in water. Absolutely amazing! They also sounded like they bought the product as a car decoration.Several of the comments, ostensibly by different customers, said exactly the same thing, in exactly the same wording:""The basic concept is easy. There are two tools, one to cut the seat belt and one...""You have to wonder who wrote them.Anyway, I tried the tools on wood planks and I'm not impressed with the impact. Which is to say I don't know if this thing will be useful at that critical moment (I bought a blue one, so you won't see me as ""verified buyer"" here)."
1,don't waste your money,"Do not waste your money buying this item. I tested it on various glass surfaces and it did not perform well, it didn't even puncture skin."
1,life saver,"I hope I never have to use this but it will prove to be a life saver if I do. I bought some as gifts because I want those people around too. Small size is nice - hangs off my keychain, but I do manage to set off my car alarm sometimes by touching the ResQMe in the wrong place."
4,An extra feeling of security,"I have one on my key chain now. The other is on my roommate's. As soon as I got them I tested them out on the box it came in. After a bit of pressure, it popped a whole straight through the cardboard. I heard that some of these were defective, so I tested both to be sure. They both worked.Only took a star off because of the seat belt cutter cover. It's the part that keeps the whole thing on your key chain, however I found it incredibly hard to remove. I'm not a weak person, and even after repeatedly removing and putting back, it doesn't show a sign of budging. I certainly am glad that this thing will NEVER fall off my key chain, but honestly I can get my pocketknife out faster than this thing. I'm kinda hoping that adrenaline will kick in and that release won't matter much, but in a panic situation where your hands might could be wet from either water or blood, I'm nervous about my roommate being able to use the seat belt cutter if she needs it."
4,works well,i tried it on my window glass and it instantly left a hole on it. it is very easy to use!
3,"It's great, but too $$$.",This product seems to function well and certainly serves a fantastic need. We've got to figure out a way to keep it American made and lower the price to where everyone can purchase it. It should be dangling from every key fob in the country. Kudos to its inventor.
4,Great product to own,This is an item you must have in your car... Personally I have provided this an easy tool for the fire fighters. Break glass and cut seatbelt. Pricewise not to bad!
4,Could save your life!,Earlier this summer my Uncle mentioned wanting these. They come in different sizes and different ways to access. Some mount to the car itself. These are a simple keychain version of a simple device that could save your life. One end is used to break glass in the event you need to get out of the car and the door doesn't open. The other is a razor blade to cut the seatbelt in case you are stuck. I was personally trapped in a sinking car one time. We had to kick the door open. I don't recommend it. These are so inexpensive. You never know! If nothing else they are a conversation piece that didn't cost much.
5,Res Q Me,"Service was good, Recieved in a timely manner. Hopefully will never have to find out if it works but it makes me feel better having it available in my car."
1,Worst Case Scenario,"Imagine giving this device to your 16 year old. Imagine he encounters circumstances to put it to use. Now imagine it fails to work. How would you feel about your gift?I ordered 6 of these as Christmas stocking-stuffers. Fortunately, my 16 year old tested the glass breaking function of his on a piece of scrap hard plastic.No matter how hard we tried we couldn't get the pin to 'pop'. The barrel simply moved in and out with no effect.I handed him another. The pin popped as it should but then remained stuck in the extended position.

I don't think a device like this ought to have what basically amounts to a 33% failure rate on the 6 I purchased.If you buy them, TEST them. Then consider installing the full-sized hammer as a back-up."
4,"Hope not to have to use, looks promising.","Fine print (read!): works on the corners of SIDE windows, not windshields, and won't work on laminated glass, which may be found in the side windows of newer, higher-end cars. The glass-breaking mechanism is easy to use (I tested on a stack of newspaper - a kid could do it). However, it'll require moderate strength to remove the blade shield to get at the seat belt cutter. I put the blade shield on and pulled it off off numerous times to wear down the plastic and make it easier to remove in an actual emergency (you could sand it down, but I didn't want to make it too easy to remove). FWIW, internet research says that ""most"" TSA screeners will let this item pass if you're boarding an airplane (beats me why they should, since it looks as if it wouldn't be that hard to fashion a box-cutter like weapon from it)."
5,key chain / safety tool,"bought this tool for the features / have not used it in an emergency yet. but comes in handy when i need to cut string etc..good product, color also stands out, cannot miss it."
5,From the seashore,"We live very close (200 yards) to the Sound on the Atlantic Ocean in North Carolina. Too many folks find on leaving the pavement that they are in water over their car. I hope that I will not need this gizmo, but I surely feel better having it in the car. I like the fact too that it stay with me if I am riding with someone else too."
1,it doesnt work,how can it save life if one of them doesnt work?it's a gift. i am pretty disappointed about this product.
3,"Don't understand why not shipped and not expected to ship for 3 weeks, when item was listed In Stock.","Item was listed as being IN STOCK, but has not been shipped and is not projected to be shipped for another three weeks. WHY ? This is poor service. I wouldn't have ordered item if it had not been listed as being In Stock. What's the deal ?"
4,Effective Safety,I saw these demonstrated on the NBC Today show. They are ideal for key ring mounting and peace of mind. Now we know the possibility exists to escape safely from a vehicle that is in water or has doors unusable for escape.
5,I Hope...,"I purchased this product as a precautionary mesure, in which I HOPE I will never use and in case I use it I HOPE it will work."
5,ResQMe keychains,This is the best all in one family safety system that I could have purchased! It comes in a compact package for both seat belt cutting but also window breaking should my family need this in an emergency within our vehicles!I only wish that I would have had this years ago. The best compact insurance a family can carry...right on your keychain! Worth every penny.
5,THE Rosetta Stone for guitar!!!!!!,"This is ALL you need. Presented in a form that actually makes sense(for once), the book is usable even for those that have never even picked up a guitar before.I have used this for 20+ years. It WORKS."
4,The Kilternan Legacy,"I very much enjoyed the Kilternan Legacy. The story about an American inheriting property in Ireland and leaving the states after an ugly divorce to claim it may at first seem far-fetch but I think that is part of it's attraction. Who hasn't wanted to find out that they are the heir to a fortune or lands in far away countries? The characters are believable and engaging. There are some you want to hug and some you want to hit. I don't think there can be a better judge of whether the characters are realistic. I recommend this book to anyone. There is little or no profanity, a little bit of action, a lot of laughter, and a nice little love story."
5,5 stars book!,"Too bad it's not translated in English (I hope it will be).I find it the most important book I've ever read. Mr. Patapievici has done an excellent job of dissecting and digesting all relevant political philosophy writings of the past 300 years and comes up with a refreshing, original and crystal clear diagnostic of the modern era ailments."
4,A Great Book,"I think that this was a great book, and the style that Nesbitt writes with is amazing. I have read the book cover to cover many times. His writing makes it feel like you are in Gettysburg, seeing the ghosts for yourself. An essential for any body who loves the Civil War! Deals with a lot of paranormal sightings during the filming of the movie Gettysburg."
1,Forget the techincal support,"If you're buying this box for the support or buying support from Mandrake, then forget it. I couldn't even get the installation disk to boot (something to do with Mandrake having problems with a DVD ROM, despite the fact that every other Linux distribution disk I tried worked), and a request for support only led to a rather dense suggestion and then a referral of my problem to ""level 3 support"". The latter never responded, not once, not to say ""your problem is progressing"", not even a ""your problem is too hard"". Of course ""level 3 support"" is /dev/null."
3,Wiley Audit Audio CD's,"The material covered was very helpful, but the sound quailty of the CD's was horrible. I had to turn up my radio all the way to hear the last two CD's and the back ground noise was distracting."
4,A real page turner,This is a really nice yarn about WW II in the Pacific with enough subplots to keep you interested. I thought Gobbell did a really good job of tying all the pieces together and keeping the story compelling. A good read for all history buffs.
4,Wonderful sample of maritime songs and chanteys,You'll want to run off and join a whaler or be thankful you're on dry land after listening to this album. Good mix of humorous and poignant music about life at sea.
2,Boring,"I love sea chanteys, which is what I thought I'd be hearing. There are some that are done well, but for the most part, this is a sea-related folk album. If you like ""I gave my love a cherry,"" this 60's folk throwback is for you! I'm going in search of some sea chanteys that my sailboat crew can sing to..."
5,British classic,"This was the basic British introductory text on wood, interesting because of the many stylized drawings of diagnostic wood anatomical characters and because it took into account the timber imported into the UK from the former British empire.Much of this book survives in 'The Anatomy of Wood' by K.Wilson and DJB.White. The latter is a revision that, although updated and thus containing more current information, was restructured in an unfortunate way making it less accessible. Frank Jane had it right the first time round."
3,Red Roomba,Bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift.It was the most affordable and lower end Roomba at the time.I don't even know if he uses it anymore.LOL
4,late,"this item was ordered as a gift, it came late, and was sent to my son so i don't know how well it works"
1,nonstop emptying?,The general consenus after a demo I saw at the mall is that it has completely inadequate storage capacity. You could probably fit 5 of these toys into a real vacuum cleaner bag. One woman suggested it could hold about 3 medium size dust bunnies.
1,should be great,"I ordered this red Roomba in February 2008. It worked well for about 3 weeks and then the brush stoped turning. I cleaned everything and when that did not work I called iRobot support and they sent me a new one. The next one lasted 2 weeks and started just going in circles and beeping. The carpet the Roomba was cleaning was not shag and not very dirty and I cleaned the Roomba after every use. Very poor quality product. Its also almost completely made from hard plastic, so one good drop could break it."
2,Breaks too soon.,"I purchased this unit recently and initially got in love with it. It really worked really well during the first half hour and my floors looked fabulous in the room it cleaned. HOWEVER it STOPPED working after that. The battery was charged but pressing clean just resulted in a single beep and nothing else. I called the customer service who were very helpful but after a few suggestions like seeing nothing was on the sensors etc. asked me to exchange it for another one. So basically my unit worked total of half hour and while I was very satisfied with it during that time it just broke down too soon without taxing it much. From what I read here lot of people have had this problem as well. So unless iRobot fixes this and makes it sturdy enough for normal household use, it remains just a cute toy which breaks on its fancy. Great concept but still some way to go."
1,Service/Support lacking,"This vacuum worked great the first few weeks, did a good job cleaning, was able to get under furniture, and was very quiet and unobstrusive. Then problems started. It ran but wouldn't pick up debris and it seemed like the brushes weren't working. I noticed the end caps had disappeared. The company sent replacement ones for free but this didn't fix problem. Now I can't get customer support on the phone despite waiting extensive stretches on hold, and e-mail support is not reponding. Can't find where to get warranty work done. So vacuum has been inoperable for a couple months. Had to break out the old upright."
4,Roomba - not bad....,"While it doesn't have much suction, it does a good job picking up hair and debris. Its very convinient to use and is alot more inteligent than I expected. It does not take the place of a full size vacuum but it really helps keep things looking good.Not bad when a guy can get away with buying a vacuum for his wife and live to tell about it!!!!"
3,Am I the only one with pet hair issues???,"I'm reading all of these great reviews, and want to know what those owners are doing with their roomba that I am not. I received my roomba 4105 for Christmas this year. I like it for some of the conveniences it offers. We have a mid-sized home with primarily wood floors, and own two big dogs. Roomba does great on the wood floors, but then leaves great big clumps of hair along the edges of the area rugs as it transitions from the floor to the rug. What a waste of time to have to go through with a hand vac to take care of all of these clumps! I clean the brushes two sometimes three times in a cleaning session, and use the unit frequently. I could see this product working very well in a home with only wood floors and no pets, or pets that don't shed."
4,This is totally cool,"My what a pleasant surprise this thing turned out to be. I thought for sure it wouldn't do the job and then break, explode or implode after the first use. I have had it for over a month and it is still purring like a kitten with no signs of destruction in sight."
5,I am convinced,"I was very skeptical but my wife wanted one. We have all wood floors and ceramic tile (no carpet). So maybe our floors are easier, but I love roomba. My kids chase it around and we call it by name. It is a member of our family now. Since we received it, we have had it on non-stop (a week now). It's great. Get one."
1,A Very Poor Product,"I admit it - I am a techie. I *like* technical stuff - computers, cool new appliances, robots. I bugged my husband to get me one of these for my birthday last year because I didn't want to spend the money ""on myself"". What a mistake...I'll be blunt - this is a piece of junk. It worked okay for about 2 months, then quit. Started making terrible noises, then stopped moving altogether. After numerous call to customer support (that took almost a month), they agreed to replace it. I had to pay to send it back to them, at which time they would send me a ""new"" one. Of course it wasn't new, it was refurbished.Two more months, and the ""new"" one is doing exactly the same thing (which is to say, nothing) as the old one. I admit we have 3 cats, so it has to pick up cat hair. But come on, it's not like there's piles of hair all over the place! A vacuum that can't pick up hair isn't much of a vacuum at all.Don't Buy It!!!"
2,Maybe it's just not for me...,"I got this as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed. It seemed to only pick up small amounts of dirt (leaving visable dirt behind) and was constantly getting ""stuck"" under the sofa and loveseat. It became such a pain that I returned it and got another regular vacuum cleaner."
2,I'll chime in on the durability problem,"This thing was awesome while it worked. I had it for 3 weeks or so, and suddenly the motor won't stop running, and I have to remove the battery just to get it to stop rolling. I know there is some sort of sensor failure. You'd think with a product this popular iRobot would put a lot more R&D toward troubleshooting and building in some toughness, but I guess not."
5,I LOVE THIS THING!,"I recently moved to a home with all hard floors and seemed to be CONSTANTLY fighting dust bunnies and cat hair. I've been interested in the Roombas for some time but never could justify it. Thankfully, I finally did!! I can't say enough good things about my Roomba Red...I liked it so much I got another Roomba! Now my goal is to get the Scooba."
3,MY LITTLE RED ROBOT,"It's cute and very entaining, but I wish it had more pick-up action or sucking power!!!It is ok for hardwood floor for dusting and those dust bunnies, but thats about it."
4,not perfect but really time saving,"Works great on tile floors.It is lacking the return to base feature,but i can plug it in manually.A real time saver if you have uncluttered areas to vacuum."
4,iRobot Roomba,"This robot vacuum has been a great time saver. It does the carpet cleaning while I do other chores around the house. I can tell it does a great job cleaning because when I empty the bin, it is full. The battery lasts about two to three hours."
1,Do Not Buy This Product!,"I purchased this cleaner a year ago to use for my office floor...just about a 16 by 20 area. It has never made it around the room yet. It gets stuck, unravels the carpet and tries to suck it up (and gets stuck), gets stuck in the corner. Awful product. I was going to send it back to the manufacturer but figured they'd resell it so I scraped that idea. I am 56 years old and have made many, many purchases over the years. This is the worst product I've ever bought. I feel truly ripped off. Do Not BUY!"
1,Get ready to Babysit,Basically the roomba will not work if there is anything in its way. Once you start it up you always have to keep an eye on it. It just randomly goes around not really picking up stuff. In the time it takes for you to get the roomba unstuck you can vacuum the whole house by yourself.
1,Piece of Junk this thing should get negative 5000 stars,This thing is the bigest waste of money it will not go from wood floor to carpet and it doest picket up any thing the except maybe the dust mit you cannot see. On top of that amazon will not let you return it.Do not waste your money if you really want one I can sell you the one I purchased
1,Work only for 1 year,"I got this last Christmas of 2004 and it die exactly around Christmas of 2005. So I wouldn't consisder this to be a product but more as a toy to have. To be honest I only use this no more that once every 2 week. So after about 26 uses it die. Well, not exactly dead, but it started doing circle and stop every 15 seconds.I never like to write review for a product because it waste my time, but for such a bad product I have to."
5,Your carpet is not clean unless you have roomba,"Works fine. Unplug the charger, press the button, go out, get home, plug in the charger. Its that simple. Works fine on tiles and carpet.Better than I expected, it works like a charm. The cleaning mechanism may not be highly powerful, but it is so thorough (who slowly and evenly pushes their vacuum over every inch of floor?) that it collects dust even from a floor that has just been cleaned with a conventional vacuum. Its compact, cheap, no bags to buy. In a few years kids will laugh when we tell them that people used to push vacuums round by hand."
5,i love this little guy,"i experienced a lower back injury a few years ago, and pretty much given up doing things like vacuuming. I recieved the Roomba for Christmas and I couldn't be happier. No lifting, no pushing, no mess and no worries. I say get this thing if you suffer from back pain and you have a dirty floor. I couldnt say better things about it."
1,They only last...maybe a year.,"I received the red roobma several years ago and I loved it. I'm a stay at home mother and thought this thing saved my life! After about a year it started acting funny. It would turn in a couple of circles then stop. So last year after IRobot came out with their latest and greatest, I bought one. It was the black scheduler for $329. Not quite a year later it started doing the same thing. I called their customer service and they said the sensors around the wheels were dirty and needed blowing out with a can of air. I did that and it did not help. I sent it back and bought a rechargable hand vac.I'd really be interested to see what all these people have to say about their roomba after 1 year."
3,A fun little device,"Cheaper alt for the $250 one, it works and works pretty good too! Great at getting under stuff, fun to watch. Not for deep cleaning, but picks up surface stuff. Good with pet hair."
4,ok so far,I just bought this & I only use it on hard floors. It does a pretty good job but it does not do the whole floor but it still does a good job. It does get stuck sometimes & really doesn't do a great job on carpet. I tried once. But I am glad I bought it. It does pick up animal hair. And it cleans good enought. And it sure saves my back.
4,darling,I bought this for my daughter who is a new mom and works full-time. She loves it. It gives her hands-free floor care. It picks up all the pet hair and seeks out the other dirt. I also bought the charger and she says that it makes it great to not have to worry about it. It just returns to the dock and is ready for the next time.
4,great if you don't get a defective one (have you ever seen a flying roomba?),"i bought 5 of these in the past two years. they are great. but the last two i got were very problematic. perhaps this particular batch is bad because the first 3 were just fine. so the problem with the last two was: one made this very unusual loud noise as if something is stuck in it. and the other one's sensor doesn't work well so it couldn't stop itself from falling off the stairs - one time i actually saw it flying down from the 2nd floor and landed with all parts scattered and the dirt inside flying all over the place..... (kind of funny actually....)That said, I'll still keep buying them until I find a non-defective one."
2,It worked beautifully until I stopped watching it,"This machine actually works great. But, I left it alone and it got stuck under a corner in my kitchen. The battery ran down while this happened and the machine never worked again. It really does work well when it's working. I sent it back for a refund because if I'm going to have to watch it I might as well be vacuuming myself."
2,Great when it works... but doesn't last very long,"I've had TWO Roombas and have been very pleased with them while they worked. Unfortunately the sensors are VERY sensitive and the machines stop working after a while. Perhaps my place is too difficult to clean... cat hair and bird dust/dander.When my original Roomba stopped working after 2 years I decided to buy a new one and purchased the Roomba Red. It worked great for about 4 months and then went kaput.I recently ordered my third Roomba and have decided to return it. Why keep donating money to iRobot? Their product, while good and clever, is not durable at all.I no longer sing the praises of this product like I used to. It's a shame... I was its #1 fan."
5,"Once you have one, will never go back to anything else!","Roomba Red works. It might not be as powerful as some others, but for low to medium pile carpet, it doesn't really need to be. Since it's much easier to use, I tend to vacuum the whole house 2-3 times per week. Plus each time you turn it on, it covers everything an average of 4 times. Both of these things mean MUCH cleaner carpets on a regular basis. It cleans much better than a cordless. (I have several different ones that I use for stairs) Great product. Consumer reports missed the boat. It's a robot and they are comparing it to non-robots. It may not have picked up as much in one pass as some of their other vacuums they tested but it isn't designed like a traditional vacuum. It goes over things 4 times, plus you use it much more often since you don't actually have to vacuum. Also, cleaning it is important and there are other important things to know to use it well. Check out www.roombareview.com to get great info."
4,If you have a Roomba doing the circle of death move,"OK I loved my Roomba ... for the 2 weeks it worked. Then it started to do this circle thing and stop and start and stop and start. Went to the irobot site and followed the instructions and by blowing on the wheel sensors it would work for a few times before doing it again.Well I called the support number and I am so glad I did instead of returning this this. A week after talking to them I had an Osmo in my hand. This little blue thing plugged into the Roomba for all of 90 seconds and did a firmware upgrade and now he works better than ever!Evidently there are some old roombas out there with older firmware and if you have one, they can tell from the serial number and just pop a free upgrade out to you in the mail.My Roomba is back to doing his daily run of the house and my carpet is back to beautiful. This product has some of the best customer support I have ever dealt with."
1,Defective product,"Roomba did not charge up. Asked for a return authorization. Was offerred a $35 credit with no return authorization. A new battery costs $70, so $35 was pretty much not much. Had to force a return authorization by cancelling the credit card charge for the whole purchase. Returned product last week. Have no idea if it has been received. Credit card dispute is still out there in case i hear that the product didn't find its way home.I like a roomba, but did not like this vendor. Poor communicator. Did not stand by the product."
2,didn't last,This didn't last long. Just long enough to not have a warranty. I love the idea but can't bring myself to buy another.
4,pretty cool.,"The Roomba works. I have two cats and it picks up the cat hair that gets everywhere everyday. I used to use a handheld vacuum everyday but now I press clean and I can run errands or knit or learn how to play the piano. It can get annoying to pick up cords everyday, so I figured out a way to remove them. I clean the filter everyday, and I was really surprised to see how much cat hair it picked up. I still vacuum my couch to remove pet hair weekly but people have mentioned that my floors look cleaner than they ever have before. Clean regularly andit works."
2,Broke after 2 months of normal use,"We bought the Roomba Red in late March and now in early May, the brushes stopped spinning. I always take special care to clean off the brushes and make sure that they are in good working order. Now that I'm a lazy slug that doesn't like to vacuum, it breaks!! I'm very disappointed. I called customer service and they are supposedly sending new brushes, which may or may not fix the problem. I think the Roomba idea is wonderful, but the design needs some work."
4,It does work,"I was very pleased with the quality of the roomba, it does detect dirt, and clean even the largest of particals. I was also surprised at the amount of lint it removes. I would recommend it. The only issue I had was It did not detect the stairs one time and did fall down the landing. However, numerous times it did and prevented itself from falling, I don't know what occurred the one time it did fall, but it came back working just fine."
2,I want to love this vacuum!,"In fact, I do love this vacuum, when it runs! I am now on my second one. The first one stopped working in 2 days. This second one lasted about a month & it's kaput as well. This product is a great idea, but it does not seem to hold up to heavy use (once a day-- dog hair and usual traffic dirt). What a disappointment! Nothing else is going to get under my beds like the Roomba does when it's working!"
4,"Great product, really surprised how well it works",I bought this as I hate to vacuum. I am totally surprised at how well it works. The brush is good size and really fluffs the carpet. I used it right away when I got it and it did a great job. I keep it plugged in and use it every few days to do the whole house. I just set it up in each room and walk away. It's easy to empty the dust bin too.
3,good cleaner,"only disappointing thing about this item is that there is no docking station ""INCLUDED"" for the robot to go back and recharge on it's own...you have to plug it back in to recharge it. Yes, you can purchase a docking station to use with it...but, my point is that it was not included. Okie dokie!"
2,Watch for defective chargers,"I can't complain when the unit works, it does clean; but the auto find home base and related charger are prone to failure. After owning this puppy for a bit over a year, they new exactly what was wrong.. worst yet no offer to replace charger... which by the way costs 30% of the entire price. No arguments with support, just said okay and threw the puppy in the trash.. save your money.. built with cheap components, worst yet they know it!"
1,this is a toy not a tool,"Well I read all the other reviews and my experience is opposite the majority. Was hopeful it would be great for our new wood floors and throw rugs but it does not do squat. We had crunched cheerios, rice, etc on the floor and the roomba either a)brushed it aside or b)went right over it and left it where it was. On top of that its randomness (which is admittedly cute) cuts against the grain of cleaning where the problem is. If I want to get the floor clean for guests I dont want to wait 3 hours for the job to get done. I ended up getting out a broom and dust pan to clean up after the roomba. Not my idea of a good investment. Can't imagine what everyone else sees in it. Mine is headed back to the store."
5,"""Little red lights up my life""","Am pleased with this produce, above my expectations, service good, but would like to ask why statement of billing not included, it is not my intention to pay any finance charges or late fees for any of my purhases.Sincerely James Sprague"
2,Cute but disapointing,I am quite demanding because I have allergies and little time. Roomba is cute (makes cute noises) but in terms of cleaning it has been disapointing.You should empty it each time you use it or it can make your room dirtier than when it started.It does not save time bacause I spend the same amount of time arranging the room so that it does not get stuck under furniture or in cords.It can be frustrating because she goes over dirt/dust and does not clean it straight away so once I found myself guiding it towards the places it needed to clean most... yes it can drive you nuts.I can imagine plenty of men buying this for their wives because it is a gadget that makes cute noises. I think we ladies are a bit more demanding...
4,Magnus review,"I don't like to houseclean. Roomba helps me with a lot ow boring jobs. I let Roomba work, and feel as good as if I had done the job myself."
5,I love this thing,"My roomba is the best present that I have ever bought for myself.I just love it. I tell everyone I know about it. It is very quiet. My cats flee from my regular vacume, where they just sit and watch the roomba. I just set it down, turn it on and walk away. I come back and the room is done. I can't say enough about it."
2,Refurbs not recommended.,"Bought a refurbished ""Red"" version of the Roomba off of Amazon and it did not last. In less than a year the battery ran out. Replaced the battery, now Roomba now makes a grinding sound when scooting across the floor. So much for ""refurbished"". Roomba also requires you to clean it out from time to time (once a month or so) to remove the hair that collects in all of the moving parts. I could vacuum the house with a normal vacuum in the time it takes to disassemble and clean the vacuum. Not much time savings there."
5,Love it!,"What more is there to say...something so tiny to do my work for me! I love it! Charges quick, vaccuums effectively and gets the job done!"
2,Roomba Red,"Have a Roomba Red...the unit would not hold a charge in less than 1 year. Although IRobot replaced it, the battery soon died shorly thereafter, then the brushes stopped working. Although it is a nice little vacuum...when it works. Don't expect to get more than 2 years out of it."
5,Roomba Red - GREAT !,"I have own a water-based vac for 1 1/2 years now and it has been only been used probably 30 times due to its bulky size and inconvenient setup. After receiving this Roomba Red, I have used it 30 times within 1 1/2 months !This is a cool machine which can clean my floor, considering the place I live is highly humid with dust almost everywhere . If me and my wife were to stare and observe the roomba running around, we will get frustrated and impatient since it is faster to use a normal vaccum. Hence like what it is designed for, we left it to run around by itself and paid no attention to it. At least the floor is cleaned while the valuable time can be used for dinner-out and shopping !ps. one point to note, like all machines, they need maintenance (CLEAN the rollers !)"
4,roomba!!!,doesn't replace a regular vaccum... but does a great job for quick touch ups. Plus!!! youcan clean something else while it is working!
1,Disposable Electronics,"The Roomba idea is clever and they can be handy during the warranty period but after that they are essentially disposable items. iRobot, the manufacturer, has cut so many corners to produce this clever device at a reasonable price that they cannot and will not supply spare parts. Five stars during warranty, 1 star thereafter."
1,The worst item and lack of customer service ever!,"With great anticipation we looked forward to this item, and it has been nothing but a nightmare. We have had three of these so far, none work. The charging system continues to fail.Expect to invest an hour to call ""customer service"" and receive little or no assistance.A wonderful concept, poor execution."
1,Not available,"My husband ordered this for me a week before Mother's Day and it's over a month past. He had to track down the company a few times to find out what was up with the order and finally got a reply saying that they were having issues with the manufacturer. As of May 30, 2008, this item is NOT IN STOCK!!! Don't buy it unless you want to wait."
1,Designed to Fail,No sooner out of warranty then one of the wheels locks up and so roomba just sits still. Save your money. Didnt even clean that well when it was working.
1,Not as good as you may think!,"When I saw this product I thought: Great. I will just get it started and it will clean while I'm doing something else! Wrong! It gets stocked quite often so you need to ""reset"" it quite often meaning you have to chase it around. Other thing is that it will go over some area over and over and over and over and over ...I know! That much it went and wouldn't move to other areas.Anyhow... my expectations were very high and they were clearly not met.Maybe a higher end model works better... I just know I won't pay that much to find out!"
3,Biggest Time Saver!!!!!,"I love the iRobot Roomba. I am a mother of 2 and work full-time, so it is such a time saver for me to push the button and have it vacuum my house while I do other housework. The kids have great fun with it as well. We love it!"
3,Refurbished is junk,"I've been so excited to get my Roomba - purchased it refurbished. After an initial 18 hour charge, the battery only lasted 30 minutes. Charged it another 24 hours. Again, it only lasted 30 minutes. I'm returning it to Amazon.BUT....I am very pleased with all the crap that the Roomba picked up off my floor - even in 30 minutes. My two toddlers are fascinted. They think its a pet and tell it not to suck up their toys. I gave it 3 starts because I'm really looking forward to getting a replacement from Amazon!"
1,"Battery So Poor, you should only use in a small apartment","My wife and I discovered that the battery use is less than 1 hour; and it takes 4 hours to recharge it!If you have a small apartment, this may work for you. If, like us, you have a larger home (2700+ sq ft)- pass this up. The Roomba did a great job of cleaning the bedroom, but used up its battery in the process. There is no way we could use it to clean the entire upstairs in 1 day, let alone the whole house. The battery just doesn't last that long.In summary, we returned it after 1 week."
1,Also disappointed,This was a great unit - while it worked. This one lasted only 6 or 7 cleanings and then died. Customer Service has not been helpful so far.
4,"""Skippy"" a good friend!","I totally love my red roomba aka""Skippy"". I use it everyday and my house always looks like I just used the vacuum. My only problem, it itself is a bit hard to clean. The dust and dog hair gets trapped in the top nooks and crannies! But, ""Skippy"" is well worth the extra trouble!"
3,Roomba 4300 Cute But of Limited Use,"The Roomba provides entertainment and some vacuuming. It is good that it is fun to watch, because it needs to be freed when stuck and takes a long time to do its work due to random pattern, and it makes too much noise to allow alternative recreation.The amazing thing is that it actually picks up some dirt."
4,Fascinating to watch,I love multi-tasking especially when there's a 4200 sq foot house to clean without the aid of a maid. The Roomba isn't quick but I usually use it way before company's coming and the job it does is more thorough than the old conventional way. I love how it cleans (especially under furniture) while I'm cleaning something else. It doesn't require much maintenace other than emptying after every use and once a week I clean the bristles. Vacuuming one large or 2-3 small rooms a day is the weekly routine. It doesn't complain about having to work like other members of the family.
2,Cleaning your roomba,"I purchased a red roomba one year ago. It worked well for a couple of weeks but then started going round in circles. I went to the website for help and learned about the machine's sensors and where they were. After a thorough cleaning the machine worked for one more day. Finally, after a few more thorough cleaning sessions, I decided that it took longer to clean out the machine to make it work than vacuuming the floors myself and I threw it into the garbage bin. In summary, a great little machine WHEN it works."
5,It's all about the cat hair!,"I bought the Roomba because I love the idea of something cleaning for me! I'm not a good housekeeper so this sounded ideal. I was a little worried about some of the reviews that the roomba would conk out though. I bought it March 4 - it's now almost 3 months and still going strong. I LOVE the roomba. For me it IS all about the cat hair, and the roomba does a great job. I love that it goes under the bed. I wish you could put it on the furniture and let it go (but that doesn't work, I tried!)"
5,Staci,"I love my new Roomba. I have had it for less than one month now, so I cannot speak to its realibility, but I have been thrilled with it since the day it arrived! What surprizes me the most about the Roomba is how often I vacuum now. I will let it loose in the bedroom while I clean the living room. Or, I will let it go in the living room while I do dishes in the kitchen. It is so easy to use, I vacuum probably three to four times a week. I just love it."
1,Defective,"The last one of these I bought was defective. It doesn't steam without adding more than a pinch of salt, and I am unable to clean the element housing because the plug does not fit in the ""lock""."
2,Serious control problems,Like others who've written a review for this mine doesn't work well. You push the buttons as hard as you can and sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn't...it's completely random and it does seem to get worse the longer you're out in the snow.
1,"Whatever you do, don't buy a Belkin","I've tried two Belkin products now, this one and the Belkin TuneCommand AV Dock with Remote. Both products are utterly disappointing, especially the TuneCommand since it's so much more expensive. The SportsCommand's buttons don't work. They go in but it's touch and go whether they come out. I'm amazed Belkin released this cause it doesn't take long to see it's complete trash.On the other hand the TuneCommand takes a while longer to realize the quality problems; The receiver stops listening to the remote and then you have to switch the power on and off to reset it, only to have it happen again 5 minutes later. This happens over and over.Be warned, you WILL regret your decision to buy Belkin products. I now search Google with -Belkin in the search query."
1,Should have been called the thing that should not be,"Terrible just terrible, this item just didn't work, it didn't work close to the ipod it didn't work far from the ipod, nothing... and then it did decide to work for about a second and a half, but the button got stuck and the volume just increased to the very top, and since i have Shure e4c headphones i almost went deaf. Anything we tried to do, and all the ipods we tried (3) did not yield any result. This product just does not work!"
1,iLingo unusable on my 2011 Macbook pro,"In 2007 I downloaded the Spanish iLingo app from iTunes on my ipod touch. It is has great little Spanish phrases, that are spoken in Spanish and English. This version with French, Italian, German, and Spanish, will not open on my 2011 Macbook pro. I need to return it to xTrememac. This software is old. Why is it still for sale if it is incomparable with new OS. Buyer beware. fileron"
1,Koala Sheets could be safety hazard,"I found Koala sheets not only to be cheaply made, but also a possible safety problem. The fitted sheet did not properly fit my standard mattress, and even with safety clips to keep it in place, I felt that my baby could pull the sheet off the mattress and become entangled. I bought other sheets for a few dollars more and stopped using the Koala sheets."
1,Don't Fit,"These sheets do not fit all mattresses. We even have a Koala Baby brand mattress, and the sheets don't fit. The Carters sheets are much better and softer, and they actually fit on the mattress."
1,dissapointing,"Fast shipping but damaged product! When I asked for a replacement, that was damaged too! They only gave me a 1/2 refund. They weren't expensive but the product was damaged! Their suggestion was to try and upsell. ( I ended up getting the same product elsewere for $.99) Not worth the hassle."
5,The Greatest Bluegrass Gospel Duo,"The Wilson Brothers' last album, recorded in 1984, is one of my all time favorites. They have a style similar to the Stanley Brothes, but in my opinion, they have a much smoother sound and know how to create beautiful music. Being a close friend of the Wilson Brothers, they are not only great musicians, but wonderful gentlemen. If you like mountain gospel, you need this album in your collection. The cross picking guitar on this album is the best I've ever heard done by Curnie Lee Wilson. Don't pass this one up!"
4,your most revolutionary music comes young,"dexter had his share of problems -- drug arrests kept him out of circulation for 10 years, and he was celebrated for his comeback and his role in ""'round midnight."" but if you want his young, unvarnished, revolutionary sound, this is the place to go. young dexter is working through the fast, fresh changes of bebop on the tenor saxophone, at a pace that no one thought a horn deeper than an alto could handle. ""long tall dexter"" is a remake of charlie parker's ""now's the time;"" ""i can't escape from you,"" is an uncommonly mature treatment of a ballad; ""dexter digs in"" -- all three takes -- is full of restless energy and power. for dexter, this is his armstrong's ""hot fives,"" monk's blue note; bird's savoy and dial. it doesn't get 5 stars because i'm a tough grader."
2,Slow service,"The book had a number of hand written notes, which really is not a big deal. My main problem was that I ordered the book on Saturday and paid extra for a quick delivery. It took the book 11 days to arrive. I wanted to use the book in a presentation, but it arrived after the fact. Usually my orders from Amazon arrive in a few days without paying a special charge.Dave McDaniel"
2,disappointing,"while there were many interesting elements in the story and the telling of the tale, my feeling is that this book would have made a much better short story than full-on novel. there is far too much ""filler"" and when i finished the book and looked back on what actually happened, i realised that the only parts that i found grabbed me were at the very beginning and the very end. the middle part was just transportation to where the story picks up again."
3,Quality Vs. Obscurity?,"For me, this CD was a little dissapointing. I'm sure that Kon and Amir are very accomplished beat diggers and DJs, but for me this felt kind of like some of those rare funky 45 CDs you pick up: 2 or 3 great tracks, the rest included because of their rarity. It's all well and good to value the rareness of a record, but a mix that uses that as a guiding principle for track selection doesn't necessarily make for an aural experience that's going to touch hearts, stimulate minds, and move booties. Although it's different, I would recommend the awesome Beni B ""Live from SF-Dance Classics Vol. 1 and 2"" CD...plenty of rare records (including the mind melting Hudson People-Trip to Your Mind, also included on the Kon and Amir), but for me a much more satisfying journey into the world of soulful underground disco."
4,New and Fresh,"Friday Fish Fry series started out stong, and has proven that was no fluke. THE CLEANING is fresh and new... its a hot mix, with great samples."
2,Battery does not hold capacity very long.,"After less than a year with this battery, it holds less than a 30% percent charge than when it did brand new even with a monthly drain/charge cycle. This one was bought as a replacement for the original that had the exact same problem. Overall, pretty crap quality batteries."
3,Won't hold charge after 1 year,I use the docking station most of the time so I was somewhat disappointed when I charged the battery only to find it will not hold a charge. I've had is for about a year and will have to purchase a new one bc it is no longer under warranty.
4,Battery Archos 604 Wifi,"This is a great looking battery, i just wish it would last a little longer but still is great value for money"
4,Archos Battery Review,"Charged up the product, has been working great as a extra battery back-up to my Archos recorder."
2,Not as represented!,"This product was received in good condition in a reasonable amount of time, but is NOT 4 inches thick. The base layer of foam is not quite 2 inches thick, and the egg crating is not 4 inches in total. What this product is in fact is a 2 inch medium density pad that may be OK for placing on a mattress, but if you are looking for an actual 4 inch foam pad, look elsewhere. And, we get to pay for the return shipping on this misrepresented item. We will see how that goes."
4,Great Price!,"I purchased this item for a family member, and they are very pleased with the product!! Great Price!! I would recommend this product!!"
3,Engaging but has incorrect or misleading information in places.,"While Oakley's text is moderately engaging and provides an interesting approach to the identity issue among Indians in the specific topics, the text, in places, is not particularly well researched. The background information contains numerous errors and misleading statements, and the citations are lacking. That is to say, some of the information discussed in the general narrative does not have a proper source. Oakley misses facts that could be easily verified, which makes the rest of the text questionable. The text does not lack value and does offer a very relevant discussion on the topic, but it is important to read it with a critical eye."
3,"Ok general information book, lacks acedemic standards","I was really excited to get to read this book, and though is it mostly well written and readability is good, the basics of research have not been held. There are several areas that should have been sourced, or more clearly sourced. A total shame and maybe if there are future editions these errors will be corrected."
1,Horrible...,"This cup is so hard that it makes a loud noise everytime you use it.It also is poorly put together, the leather already started coming apart after a few uses.This is not for bar use.I would not recommend this product to anyone.Waste of money."
4,Pet Gate,Nicely made. Very easy to install. Impotrant - Bottom stays on the floor. Would have been 5 Star if it had a knob/handle on the top (which I added) to make it easier to open and close.
3,gate,It arrived in good codition.Only problem is it is a little hard to open with the cap on top. Older ones without this safety feature were easy to open and my dogs never were injured in it.
2,Difficult to use,"This gate serves its purpose for large openings, but the spring latch is very difficult to use. I have pinched my fingers on it many times. It is also difficult to close because you have to fit a small piece into an eyehook to secure the bottom of the gate. If you miss this, the bottom of the gate will move quite a bit if pushed. Overall, it will work if you do not go in an out of it too much, but is not good for high traffic areas."
2,Possibly Harmful,"This gate served it's purpose while it lasted, so I can not bring myself to rate it a 1. However there are a few things one should know before purchasing it. First, it is difficult to open and close. The latch does pinch and is often a pain to line up. We found it much easier to just step over the thing. Second, on the opening side there is one pinchable latch at the top and the bottom rests in a little hook of which my son was able to manipulate with little problem to push up just enough to pop the bottom out and crawl through it. Third and most importantly, it is a nightmare for climbing toddlers. The criss-cross design allows for easy climbing and just last week my 19 month old scaled it only to land head first on the other side. So that is definitely something parents will want to consider before purchasing this baby gate. For this reason alone I would dissuade parents from buying this particular design."
4,Expansion Swing Gate,"This gate was well worth the money spent. We use it at a stairway to prevent our grandson from getting to the stairs. Simple installation, however I believe that by a Year or Year and Half, he will have the latch figured out."
4,Easy to install,We had this before and it lasted for 6 years before needing another one. It's easy to install and doesn't leave too many marks in the wall to repair when removed.
3,Dog breeder,"I'm a dog breeder with a small amount of dogs that are in and out the door all the time. this gate works great to keep them out of the room that they don't need to be in. The latch could use a re-design because it's a PITA to use but otherwise, it's great. I doubt it would work well for a child though. the dogs don't lean on it but the couple times they pushed on it, it popped open. I don't think it's secure enough for a child. Certainly would never put it at the top of the stairs, that's deadly accident waiting to happen !!"
2,falls short of ideal,"I bought this to replace another brand improperly installed and difficult to operate by my 4 year old and our 88yr old grandfather who lives with us. This model is not much more easy for them to operate, fact the 88yr old (has parkinson's) cant really do it and the metal used for the latches are weaker. It claims to be a ""swinging"" gate but the bottom metal latch bends when swung, I fear after enough swings it will eventually break. The top latch is of decent design but when coupled with the bottom part it becomes more difficult. The plastic cover on the top also makes it tougher to expand and contract than a normal expansion gate. One redeeming quality is that it expands to 60"" without the need of extensions."
4,Expanding feature,This met our needs better than most - many gates now do not expand like this one does. The top cover helps avoid pinching but the included eyes are a weak hinge mount and don't use the mounting dimensions literally - make your own measurements to decide where to mount this.
2,screw in...,you need to screw hooks into the wall and the baby just pushes really hard and pulls the hooks out of the wall
4,good gate for the price,"When I bought this gate, I was actually looking for something to keep my large, very strong puppy out of certain areas of the house.I went with this one because I didn't want to spend a lot of money and I thought the lattice design was better looking than most expandable gates. The wood is quite a bit sturdier than I expected, and it's extremely easy to adjust it to fit any doorway. The downsides are that latch is a bit small, so it's awkward the first few times you use it, and you have to install bolts into your walls to mount the gate. I don't mind the bolts TOO much, though, because I know for sure that since it's attached right to the wall the gate won't pop out of place if the dog jumps against it.All-in-all, if you're looking for a pet gate that looks decent, is fairly strong, and won't break the bank, this gate is perfect."
1,Not the right product,This item was sent to a correctional facility and since it was the wrong item it was thrown out. So not only am I out the ten dollars but the person I sent it to didn't get what he needed.
1,Get the order straight,I ordered the Recoton EP3 Audio Earphone twice. I was delivered speaker extensions both times. I would love to have this product but the company seems to be unable to deliver.
2,Misrepresented excercise program.,"This exercise video indicates it is geared for persons in wheelchairs. Yes, someone sitting in a wheelchair can use this, but it is NOT appropriate for a person confined to a wheelchair. Amanda Cook clearly is not gearing her program to persons with spinal cord injuries when she discusses exercise form and techniques.Chair Aerobics for Everyone: Wheelchair WorkoutThis video was misrepresented as a program appropriate for wheelchair bound persons."
1,Seems to be arranged backwards and the exercises are too fast.,"It seems to me that the sequence is backwards. It starts out with a set of very fast exercises, no warmup, and then later the tempo slows down. Also the disclaimer about caution while exercising is at the very end. Weird editing.At the beginning I though ""this is a good video for someone who is in a wheelchair and is very fit!""But how many people in a wheelchair are fit to begin with ?I have been in a wheelchair for 5 years and I am not fit.Way too fast.Check outSit Stretch Smile"
3,Good workout,"It provides a Good workout for my handicapped daughter. The presentation is not particularly exciting, just average but the excercises work pretty well."
3,Not what I have come to expect,"- Ellis seemed to have moved to the main stream side of music on this album. It is filled with way too many musicians, Ellis is at his best in a raw solo guitar in hand eyes closed bellowing into the mike. When you add another musician it takes away what we love about Ellis add three or four musicians and it sounds like another B grade CD. I think Ellis has peaked, I hate to admit it but it seems to have happened. WAIT!!! WAIT!!!----I take it ALL back - This album has grown on me I love it- The more you listen the more it becomes real-- buy it - listen -listen and then listen again- you will be amazed---- It grows on you like a bad girlfriend- it will not leave you alone"
2,An Ellis Fan,I have been looking forward to this CD for a very long time. Some of my favorite Ellis songs I had only heard live are on this CD. When I bought it and read on the back that Duke Levine and Lucy Kaplansky were involved I couldn't wait to get home. After listening I started to wonder if Ellis sang the vocals and went home. The beauty of his music is the intonations of his voice mixed with his guitar. This CD was so overproduced I found myself straining to hear Ellis. If this is the first Ellis you've heard buy Live or Sweet Mistakes and listen again. He is amazing... this CD is not.
2,Disappointing on First Listen,"Hey, I'm one of the biggest Ellis Paul fans out there. But I'll be the first to speak the truth. This album (at least on first listen) is a big disappointment. The songs are probably good, but Ellis has yet again chosen a producer who doesn't understand how to put together good folk rock.Perhaps this is something that his manager should be helping him with, but Ellis really, really needs to find himself a good producer who can finally capture his musical essence. This CD certainly isn't that. It's thin, uninteresting production despite a cast of good musicians and good songs. The ironic thing is that his last CD (Sweet Mistakes), which was supposedly an unfinished ""experimental CD"", appears to me to be his most polished, sophisticated, ""finished"" disc to date. Ellis, please get someone like T Bone Burnett (of Counting Crows' ""August and Everyting After"" fame) for your next CD!"
3,Good but not his best,"I am a huge Ellis fan! I found this album to be over produced and it lacks the down to earth tone that his other albums have. Ellis gets lost in this one. Sweet Mistakes and his Live album are much better though his new collaborative song ""God's Promise"" is beautiful but again I liked it better when I heard it in a live show."
5,You HAVE to read this!,"This book was very good. The unicorns are havinga Halloween party. But suddenly things start to gowrong Jessica and her friends are finding skeletonbones, one of her friends is even having visions.But does anyone know if the Unicorns are playingtricks or about to have a terrifying experience?(You'll have to read it to find out!)"
2,Gloss over cajun music,"A friend of mine thinks the world of this guy...and I'm lost to say why. If you think this is cajun music you need to look further. Esp. on this cd. It sounds so glossed over, almost like computer sound driven. The guy can put on a show but this sound is so sterile. Please look to Clifton Chenier and work your way down from there. Im part ""cajun"" and I think this reeks."
5,Perfect for when you just want to relax,"I bought this for my son ages ago and only just recently listened to it. It is so calming and relaxing -- just music -- that I discovered I can plug it in when I'm feeling really stressed and will begin to relax within minutes. Whether you are meditating or just relaxing, this is excellent background music."
5,Music for Muses,"This was purchased for an unlce 93, who in a former life was an accountant. He took piano lessons after he retired, not that he can play well, but he can play and feel the music more. He says he enjoys the CD, it does have a gentle way about it. He likes to play it after going on a short walk, or when sitting and musing or reading in an easy chair, or as soft background music for conversation. This obviously is not a music review, but he likes it. I like it also. It is what it says it is, meditation music."
2,less than expected,"I've expected more from the disc. The melodies remind one another, the performance also could be better."
2,"Okay, could be better","Two simple squares attached to two sleeves is not a bad choice for a new knitter's first sweater. But the drop shoulder style is limiting, and definitely favors slight women with boyish builds. It's pretty much the same pattern for each sweater in this book, with changes in the yarn and a few details. (Sleeves or sleeveless, stockinette or mock ribbing, round neck or squared neck.) Aspiring knitters should check out Melville's ""The Knitting Experience"" series, Debbie Bliss's ""How to Knit"", Phelps/Hiatt's ""Simply Beautiful Sweaters"" - and there are probably many more - for projects that begin with the basics but develop skills and don't 'dumb down'. A knitter who can appreciate style and fine yarn is probably going to feel constrained after the first few ""box patterns""."
2,"Pretty pictures, gorgeous yarns, somewhat boring designs","I just got this book for my birthday, and was excited about it, because at the first glance, the book looks nice, and the sweater designs seem sane and comfortable.That is, until I actually looked at the patterns and instructions, and noticed a recurring theme in most of the designs.In fact, many of the instructions in this book seem to more or less go like this:1. Take 2km of hideously expensive yarn.2. Cast on 120 stitches, using the biggest needles you can find3. Knit two squares of garter/stockinette stitch.4. Make two sleeves.5. Sew together, leaving a small hole for your head.6. wear your bulky shapeless sweater which only looks nice because the yarn is gorgeous."
5,Wonderful Addition to My Knitting Library,"Ms. Cohen's book offers wonderful and unique sweater patterns to knitters who are looking to improve and further develop their knitting skills. Even a new knitter will be successful with the easy to understand directions. I received ""rave reviews"" when modeling my two new sweaters."
2,"Seen one, seen 'em all","It's hard to see why this book was published in its present format. Essentially, it consists of a series of photographs of the same sweater, a long-sleeved boat neck pullover, knitted in different yarns. There are a few differences here and there - the addition of a hood or a turtleneck, for instance - but not enough to make a purchase worthwhile. Perhaps a beginner might find Simple Sweaters helpful in learning the basics - knit 4 rectangles in 2 sizes and sew them together. Otherwise, nicer patterns can be found for free on the internet."
4,Nicely-done,"I bought this book just based on the cover sweater alone. I think it's fantastic. It's high on my list of things to knit! There are several sweaters in this book that are lovely, elegant, and have just tried-and-true lines and fit.I'm not sure why this book is getting reviewed badly here for reasons such as ""uses ridiculously-priced yarn"" or for ""dull, boxy designs."" Hey, folks, let's read the title again: Knitting SIMPLE sweaters from LUXURIOUS yarns. It's kind of a no-brainer to me.Anyway, I don't intend on using anything luxurious to knit things in this book, as I don't own large enough quantities of anything luxurious. However, I found that yarn substitution is going to be very do-able because the patterns are quite easy to handle, even for beginning knitters for whom getting gauge might be an issue."
5,The Steel Bonnets,"Loved it!This book is about the conditions on the ""no man's land"" between England and Scotland in the 1500's to the 1600's. However, this book can give you a very good understanding of what goes on in a modern day ""failed state"".The politics, the economics, and the violence and lawlessness are very much the same as many other parts of the world in this century.This could arguably apply to places like the border between Israel/Palestine or Pakistan/Afghanistan etc."
4,Fun but difficult,"This is a fun compilation of ""Animaniacs"" songs. Unfortunately, ""Animaniacs"" songs are so rapid fire that it's hard to keep up if you know the words, much less if you're trying to follow along with the lyrics on screen. (And I'm a grownup!)"
1,Thin and arrived damaged,"Amazon has quick shipping and is convenient, but the product arrived damaged in one corner. Quality of the board is marginal - thin construction. I suggest buying a more expensive board to get better quality."
4,Spectacular Quality,"This was a wonderful set and the quality of both the film and the sound was more than I expected, considering the age of the original film. I can't wait for the rest of the nine seasons to be released. Perry Mason can be considered the Who's Who of young actors, many of whom went on to bigger and better things."
1,Very disappointed - No closed caption and no sub-title for Perry Mason DVD - made me cry!,"I was very excited to watch famous TV classic ""Perry Mason"" on DVD. I realized that DVD's Perry Mason does not provide closed caption and sub-title either. That broke my heart and began to cry because I had difficulties to hear what they said clearly due to my hard-of-hearing, especially for senior citizens! How could Paramount neglect closed captions and sub-title on these famous TV classic DVDs? Paramount are certainly brutally discriminated against handicapped, especially for hearing impaired, and even, non-English speakers who need to learn to read and understand by using English sub-title. We would appreciate their service, especially for Paramount when they put sub-title on DVD's TV classic. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea has sub-title and it was superb - Fantastic and fun to watch!"
4,greatly enjoyed it,If you enjoy the old black and whites as well as the who done its then you willenjoy Perry Mason. It is nice to be able to watch something without the filthof profanity or all the garbage they put in shows now days. Hope you enjoy it.
5,Early Perry Mason,"Having read every Perry Mason mystery many years ago, and having been a big fan of murder mysteries for years also, watching the original Perry Mason series with Raymond Burr was a very enjoyable walk down memory lane. The picture quality of the DVDs was much better than some of the other black and white DVDs that I own. I must admit that the 5-star rating I assigned to this review is due in part to nostalgia, but the old Perry Mason series was the forerunner for many of the murder mystery dramas that appear on television today. For that reason alone, it deserves a second look by anyone who enjoys trying to figure out a good murder mystery."
3,TITLE CORRECTION,"FOR SOME STRANGE REASON, THE LISTING FOR THIS SAYS SEASON 2, VOL. 2.THIS IS INCORRECT.THIS IS ACTUALLY SEASON ONE VOL. 1, WHICH IS THE ONLY PERRY MASON DVD COLLECTION AVAILABLE CURRENTLY.FOR A TV SHOW RELEASED IN THE '50'S THE PICTURE IS GOOD THOUGH THE SOUND CAN SOUND HARSH ON MODERN AUDIO EQUIPMENT."
3,"No ""play all"" feature","I recently ordered the Perry Mason 1st and 2nd seasons but I am very disappointedwith them because there is not a ""Play All"" feature. My mother, who likes to watch it every night, has Alzheimer's and, even though she knows what she is watching, can't learn to push the button for each episode. Since I am upstairs doing my things while she is watching it, I have to stop what I'm doing and go up and down the steps after every episode to start the next one. That is so aggravating. It never occured to me that they would have done them that way. I thought they were over-priced to begin with but being done that way is even more of a rip-off."
3,cntinuance,I LIKE THE FACT TYHAT THEY'RE STARTING WITH NTHE FIRST SEASON...BUT I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE THE EPISODES CONTINUE WITHOUT STOPPING.
5,Tom: A True Fan!,"I have waited for years for this DVD. I watched Perry Mason on TV when I was very young when it first aired and its just as excellent today as it was then. It is better than many of the shows being produced today by far. It has character and a sustaining charm that few shows do.I know on reading other reviews, some are concerned that the set did not contain extras and that the first set was not the complete total of all the shows of the first year. Perhaps, but the quality is first rate and other DVD Sets of this fine show are selling for $139 a pop for the first year. This set, when the remainder of the first year comes out, (hopefully soon), will total out at $68, a little less than half of other sets.I strongly recomend this collection to any fan, young or old, who wants to have a treasure of a show to watch and enjoy time and time again. This is an amazing culmination of acting, story, and style."
2,Doesn't Anyone Else Notice the Rip-Off?,"Perry Mason was and remains a great 5-star show, and I really want it on DVD. But am I the only one who thinks this 1/2-season set is a rip-off? This is a very disturbing recent trend in old TV show DVD releases. They give you 1/2 half of a season for a list of $50--that's $100 per season!! There are still a lot of shows that give you whole seasons for less that $60. Also, at the rate these are likely to be released, it will be many years before they're all out. I may be dead and buried by then. Disgusting."
3,the dvd needs help,"If you like Perry Mason you will enjoy it. It is nice to watch PM without commercials. The dvd itself has a problem. When it comes on, it has to go through a couple of minutes ritual of unneeded whatever. The bad part is.that it won't let you fast foreward through it. Also when you watch one episode you can't go back and watch another one. To watch another episode you have to take the dvd out and put it back in. The you have to watch the junk again before you start another episode. Very aggrivating."
5,Brilliant,"Does exactly what it is supposed to. If you build your own systems and encounter an issue, this power tester is essential. Believe me. Chasing stupid electrical problems is like chasing cats. Buy some peace of mind by eliminating the obvious, first."
4,Good for fast service,I buy this for fast repair service. Good to quick diagnose PS but expect high overheat when stay connected some time.
3,Ok . . . But wrong item!,I ordered SEM bumper repair kit but instead of getting the specific bumper repair kit for rubber like plastic I got the general SEM plastic repair. I was very disappointing.I did not have time to return it so I kept it and use it. It seems to work ok but still I would have like my order to be the proper item!
2,Very faint...not sure whether I am pregnant or not?,This is not a very good test kit because the positive line was very faint when I tested two days after I missed my period. So not sure whether I am pregnant or not after testing with this. I used different test kit and it showed a clear positive pregnancy.
3,Very Faint Line after 4 days late,"I got a negative on my first day late. I've never been pregnant before and never used a pregnancy test. After 4 days late I still wasn't sure because the line was very faint. It did work because I am pregnant, but I was a bit unsure so I went to the Dr for another test."
3,OK BOOK,Was expecting more from this little book. Looking for one with many English recipes I remember but this is not it. Not bad though
4,Good reading,"I was looking for a british cookbook with traditional recipes, and I found it. I found this book to contain all those traditional recipes that you hear about, but when you look them up, find all those modern variations. But this book gives you the traditional recipes, and was very happy to find a melton mowbry style english pork pie recipe."
5,great book,I only browsed through this book so far and I have found some great receipes. This is definitely one of those cookbooks you'd find at grandma's house. It's extremely simple and useful for those who love to cook.
3,Not enough recipies,"A bit dissappointed. As thick as this book is, it should have had more recipies.A lot of the recipies in this book, are very old, and not of popular current British dishes."
3,Not for those with little time,"I like to cook but don't have as much time for it as I'd like. I can do the recipes in this book on the weekends, but on workdays, they just take too long.That's too bad, because the food is very good."
5,A beautiful collection of sting videos for any fan.,"A wonderful collection of several of Sting's greatest videos up to 10 Summoners Tales. You can clearly see the evolution of Sting's music videos from the silly video for ""If you Love Someone Set Them Free"" with many silly video effects to the breathtaking ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"" Which is one of the most breath taking videos of all time. Several of the videos are rather silly but quite entertaining."
2,Canon Battery? Not.,"From the title of this item offered by Accessory Genie, I was led to believe I would be receiving a Canon-brand battery. What I received was a Pro Power battery that fits the Canon camera -- like many other batteries offered on Amazon. The others were brand specific, I feel this one is deceptive.How well does it work? Only time will tell as I've only had it for about a week. It claims to have a three year warranty. We'll see...I had to give the 2-star rating based on the bait-n-switch or the lack of the reference of the Pro Power brand. I should've noticed it was a shady product when the Product Description was laden with spammed keywords."
4,Pitch ahoy,Built my son a pitching mound and the rubber works great. Easy to install. Pitches better than Nolan Ryan and Tom Seaver
3,"Good video clips, sometimes irritating narration","The only criticism I have is the way it's narrated - amateurish, with the repeated irritating sentence of the narrator: ""He was TRULY a LEGEND of COMEDY!"" (After a while, you cringe a little as you hear it once more.) Butthe video clips are interesting."
3,A bit outdated but still good,"The book is a bit outdated, but there are some stuff that is relevant. That's why it gets an Ok."
4,Vacation fish feeder,"Great choice for fish feeding when going on a vacation. Medium size cichlid pellets fit well. Flakes work also as long as they are broken into a size smaller than 1/4 inch. Waffers also need to be broken into small enough sizes. The reservoir is plenty large. Only 1/10th was needed for a week. The ability to adjust feeding for 2, 3, or 4 feedings per day is a nice feature. Definitely recommended."
2,Could be better,"Worked great for about 7-8 months, i bought 2. Then they both stopped working.I like that they hold 4 months worth of food, and you can feed 4 times a day.Just don't know why they only lasted 7-8 months."
1,garbage,"Let's see, first it jammed. So then I thought that I would just fill each individual feeding slot and be able to feed twice a day for a week. That worked for a few weeks until the feeder arms bent enough to just keep the feeder engaged and it fed all of the food in one day. And, even if it had worked as it should have, there is no way to adjust the amount of food that this thing feeds. Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage."
5,great item,This is a great product. Works as advertized. I'm thinking about getting another. Great for vacations. feeds 3 times a day for about 30 days.
1,Wrong item sent,"I had the same issue it seems like a lot of people have had with this product. The wrong part was sent, and tbh it wasn't worth my time to return it. Bad company, straight up+MISLEADING DESCRIPTION."
