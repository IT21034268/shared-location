2,Prostituted Potential,"I picked up ""Woman in the Dunes"" with a rather high expectancy, I put it down feeling somewhat robbed. The weakness of this novel does not derive from the unique plot, but rather the way it prostitutes itself, allowing such bland descriptions. Kafka, one of my favorite authors and one cited as similiar to Abe, has been accused of a journalistic style. However, it is not his style - which is endlessly inventive and consuming - but rather his word choice that is so. Abe, on the other hand, is simply banal, monotonous (I couldn't count the many passsages speaking of spit and sand, come on no matter how diffrently you say it, its still spit and sand) and non-descriptive. Think diffrently, just look over the first chapter.Also, I found the erotic elements of the story to be pretensious, shallow, and that dreaded of all words, ""cheesy."" Perhaps it is not so bad, it is simply its potential that has driven it into the ground. Such a brilliant narrative deserves its due credit."
1,One track book to nowhere,"This book was as flat as a day-old can of opened soda. The beginning was intriguing, but the moment the lead character ended up in his sandy prison, the book ended. Or at least should have. Everything was painfully predictable and I ended up skimming through most of the book. The relentless morbidity of the book made it impossible for me to even remotely relate to the characters, which in the end (finally!) made me leave it behind when I returned from vacation."
2,Japanese Kafka,"If you were frustrated by Kafka's ""The Trial"", you're going to pull your hair out with this one. Why read it, you already know how it ends..."
3,sand=fate=destiny=time=futility,"Abe does a really cool job of blending an absurd, Beckett-like scenario with these really precise technical details. He makes sand have a personality unto itself. How many people can pull that off? It's one of those odd books that manages to be both remarkably straight forward yet totally inscrutable at the same time. You'll never look at a sandy beach the same way again."
5,"Wer Rhytmus liebt, wird diese CD lieben!","Als ich die ersten Klänge der CD hörte, dachte ich, ich könne nie wieder eine andere Musik so lieben wie diese. Es ist unglaublich wie dieser Rhytmus und die Melodie in Herz und Beine steigt. Diese CD von Aman Azul MUSS man haben, jede langweilige Latinparty wird mit dieser zum grossen Knaller! Hilft bei schlechter Laune (Chef hat schlechte Laune? CD einlegen, und er schenkt dir 10 Urlaubtstage?!) Also wer die CD von Aman Azul nicht hat, ist selber schuld!!!"
5,A Question,"May I ask a question? Many of the things that haunted the character Austerlitz were later found by him to be places, buildings, and shapes that he had seen as a young boy, prior to his escape.But some of the haunting things had only been seen or experienced by his mother, correct? The young boy never saw Theresienstadt, according to the narrative, thus wouldn't have known anything about the shape of the architecture there - and yet it obsessed him until he went there and saw it for the first time. I need to read it again, but can someone comment?"
2,Well,"I must say this was one of the most painful reading experiences that I have endured yet. As one reviewer writes, there is a wonderful story in there somewhere, however, it is completely veiled in the taxing and obfuscated style Mr. Sebald uses.I found the lengthy paragraphs and lack of sections annoying, but I do not find that to be a high crime of literature. But, having three (at least) independent narrators all tell stories in the first person without any clarifying identifiers or landmarks is simply preposterous. I found myself continually looking back as I wondered: ""Which is this one now?""Hearing great things about Mr. Sebald (and seeing him lauded by Susan Sontag) I was compelled to drive through to the end, hoping that Mr. Sebald would reward me for my arduous journey through this complex and harrowing tapestry he had wrought.Does it end?Unless you very much prefer style over story, avoid this one."
2,Clueless as to the Reasons for the Hype,"Like the other negative reviewer, I just can't comprehend what all the hype is all about with this book. I read a good bit,probably 10 books a month, and this is clearly one of the most ponderous, rambling, sleep inducing books I have read in a long time. The author manages to turn a potentially gripping and tragic tale into a tedious reading experience by constantly going off into tangents whenever the story becomes gripping. Somewhere, buried inside of this novel there is an excellent story struggling to escape. However, the sheer dullness of this book completely defeats any effort of this story to emerge."
2,an endless search for the past,"Thank heavens I finally got to the end of this book, hoping something really interesting would happen to Mr. Austerlitz as he travels around trying to find his roots. The fact that it is told by another person, who must share with us every event and experience related to whatever place he currently is staying at, does not help. Pretty good bed time reading if you have trouble falling asleep."
3,a bit thickly-written,"Austerlitz is fiction: Sebald's telling of a man who goes back to Europe to dig into his family roots and discovers the details of their being chased out of Europe (or killed) by the Nazis.One thing I loved was Sebald's merging photos and illustrations into the running text of this ""memoir."" I wish there were more books like that.But elsewhere I found the power of the book blunted by Sebald's almost self-consciously pretentious style. Instead of being written in an immediate, believable way, it was written in a distanced, intellectual way that seemed to insulate you from the shock and horror, etc. It's very Iowa.No wonder Sontag loved it."
4,Susan Sontag did it better,"Sebald writes like an accountant.He doesn t want to innovate yet that s what he does with his pictures,erudition and a good story that climbs and soars like a battle"
1,Painful,"With all due respect to the distinguished Sebald, I found this book to be torturous. I was forever waiting for a plot. Not a book to get lost it."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I got a copy of this on my kindle from my local library. It's due back like tomorrow and I'm only 10% into it because it's too difficult and boring to be an enjoyable read. Maybe I'm just not smart enough, I don't know but I doubt I will ever finish this thing."
3,appealing to all ages,this book was very interesting and should appeal to all ages. Austerlitz has a powerful life story which we could all learn from
1,All I could do was sigh,"If I could I would give no stars. I could read barely a hundred pages of this book and would not have read even one had it not been this month's book group selection. In fact I would not have read even one paragraph, that is if one could be discerned. The book seems to be one endless run-on paragraph. It was sort of like attempting to swim the Atlantic. Now I have to attend a book group meeting where I explain why this book is not worth the paper it is written on. As long as the trees were already dead I guess that doesn't matter. ... Readers beware! Don't believe the hype written by the pretentious ""critics"" who adorn the first few pages and the back cover of this book. Together they create a wall of slaver. That wall makes a literate reader like myself tremble with fear when I compare the actual writing to the praise and feel myself to be the dumbest individual on earth. But so be it. Stay away if you want a compelling, good read."
1,A deeply disingenous writer,Austerlitz is a heavy and self-important and clumsy and unrepentantly dull novel written by a deeply disingenuous writer.
1,I can't believe this was published!,"My one regret with this book was finishing it. I should have put it down on page 2. Reviewers said it was beautifully written. I can't believe they read it. The sentences were run-on (one sentence lasted 4 pages!!). There were no paragraphs even when the entire subject changed (searching for father rather than mother.) Amazing. I suppose the editors went to sleep on this one. Must one write poorly to show a particular train of thought or theme? I don't think so.I definitely wouldn't buy this book and I definitely won't read the previous books by Sebald. I don't know if the translation was poor or the initial writing. But. . . you undertake this task at great risk.I'm an avid reader of all kinds of fiction and nonfiction, and I've never written a negative review. But, I decided to share my thoughts this time to save an unknowing reader from this extremely frustrating read."
2,over rated and dissapointing,"I read this book based on its many positive reviews. However I did not find it to be as exceptional as others would lead you to believe. Firstly, as mentioned in other reviews, the story is told by un unknown narrator, a device that distances the reader from the subject, but serves no other purpose. Then, there is no plot to speak of, but rather a series of observations and comments on subjects ranging from architectural history to botany. The book includes several highly critical passages of modern architecture that point to the fact that Austerlitz is an architectural historian obsessed with the old glory of buildings in the past and unable to understand the relevance of contemporary architecture. While well written and almost poetic at times, it sheds no light on the historical events that led to Austerlitz to search for his parents. I would not recommend this book."
3,a reference,"This book is repetitive of other books in the genre (healing wise woman traditions) but it is also an excellent book to have on reference for when you forget the stuff that you know you 'know'. There are comforting tea recipes, yoga poses (that don't make me feel like I have to compete with yogis in some class) and a mish-mash of information pertaining to women's healing. It's a comforting little reference book to have when I don't have the time or energy to flip through hundreds of pages of other reference books."
2,atomic age snooz fest,"if your like me and find interest in atomic age stuff, this is a snoozz fest, most of the material you may have already. i do but its an ok film if your just doodleing around, but not worth the price."
5,FANTASTIC,This book is a must have. In my 28 years of being a Christian this is by far the best book I have ever read. It is absolutely amazing. This book is like having your own personal counselor at your disposal who not only gives you understanding on how life works but gives you the tools to share these truths with others. Great tool to share with both believers and non-believers. I HIGHLY recommend this book.
5,Thank you Dr. Kellemen,"Clear, well-written, accesible to the educated lay-person; what else can I say? Forget post-modern philosophy and pop-psychology--come drink from the Spring of Living Water! This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in helping others. I would not, however, call it an introductory text. If you need to become a sensitive, open listener, I would recommend you wait for the release of Dr. Kellemen's book ""Spiritual Friends"" in October. He has assured me through correspondence that it will cover these and other more basic topics. Buy and read both and you will be well prepared for the life changing work ahead."
4,Very good horror story,This was the first book I read by Charles Grant and I was impressed. Good storyline it will keep you guessing. Very interesting characters. I'll be sure not to get stranded in a restaunt during a blizzard after reading this book.
3,"Taut, gripping but ultimately disappointing thriller","I read Raven in one sitting. I didn't mean to but once I got into the book I couldn't put it down. In a wonderful study of claustrophobia and paranoia, a small group of people find themselves trapped at an isolated diner while outside a lone man armed with a high powered rifle picks them off one by one. My only complaint is in the final revelation of who the killer is... a, in my opinion, rather disappointing ending. Up until that point, though, this book is a serious contender with classic stories such as Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians""/""And Then There Were None""."
3,"captivating, but the ending was dissapointing","the story itself was very good. It had me at the edge of my seat, but the ending was poorly done and thought through."
5,Quail Hunting in America,This is an excellent book with many practical applications and advice. I recommend it.
5,Young Indiana Jones and the Titanic Adventure,This is a great addition to the Young Indianna Series. I am just mad I can't buy it. I read it at by local liberey AND IT WAS great. I wish more kids like me today could have the chance to read this great books.... Well this is about young Indy and hes trip home to American on the Titanic. It's full of action and fun. So if u can get your hands on this book read it Okay. <3 <3 <3 J.E.
2,TOO SLOW!!,"This book was a very slow read. Nothing exicting happen until the last chapter. Troy's character was not developed, therefore I could not drum up the symphathy for him that would have been there if the character was more developed. Basically, you can read the 1st chapter and last chapter without putting yourself through the agony of reading the entire book. There is no way I would have finished it if I was not reading it for my book club. I would not recommend this book."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air,"Promises to Keep was a refreshing read. After reading soooo many African-American books on dating, relationships, and battles against the sexes, it was a pleasant change to read Gloria Mallette's mystery novel about family ties, how each person deals with the death of a loved one and how the family comes to terms about how they feel about each other and things they've kept bottled up for so long. After reading Promises to Keep, I can't wait to read Mallette's other books."
2,Not great literature,"I recently purchased two books on Egypt: the Yacoubian Building by Alaa Al Aswany after having read a review in the New Yorker ; and Palace Walk by Naguib Mahfouz. There is no discussing: the Palace Walk is great literature, the character of the woman is immediately rich, profound, moving, feminine, mysterious, and interesting ; while the Yacoubian Building is popular, easy, funny, ""mind catching"" but not nearly as impressive as Mahfouz's work. I recommend the Yacoubian Building for suburban train trip reading, and Palace Walk for a week of literary enjoyment."
5,Amazing and Authentic Portrait,"This author should be commended for giving us an amazing and authenticcharacter portrait of modern day Egypt. It is especially elucidatingat this time of upheaval and revolution in the ancient land. Reading thisbook, we have a compelling picture of what motivates this much needed andlong overdue change. I think this author should be credited with formulatingthe undercurrents that are like electromagnetic sparks in Egyptian societytoday, as I write. Al Aswany's book is, in fact, much more valuable of ahistorical and literary record than anything that Orhan Pamuk has writtenthus far, though for political reasons Pamuk seems to be getting all of theattention. This book is a great work of fiction, and like all good fictionit educates and enlightens us and helps us better understand the lives ofothers. The character portraits are fascinating and are drawn by a masterartist. Highly recommended."
5,"Human, humane, insightful","Great literature both entertains and enlightens. Although far more compact and spare, The Yacoubian Building encompasses as broad and cross-cutting a view of a society as any work by Thackeray, Eliot or Hardy. But in this case the society is a contemporary Muslim one and Alaa Al Aswany's concise novel offers convincing insights into the conflicts between the secular and religious, the petty and the idealistic, the political and the personal, and, ultimately, the West and the East in modern Egypt while telling the interlocking stories of the loves, ambitions, small victories and devastating defeats of both the affluent and poor who live in - and on - the Yacoubian Building."
2,meh,it is just meh. Stories are okay--there are only few instances I was driven to know what was coming next. The characters were not well developed. He brings closure too quickly to everything. Meh. It is just meh.
2,The Yacoubian Building,"This translation was surprisingly natural in style. Easy to read, and quick to get into.However, after a while the introductions of the huge cast of residents in the Yacoubian building threatens to engulf the growing story. I almost put the book down at this stage, even though these 'vignettes' are interesting in themselves, I wondered if the story was ever going to start."
3,Interesting Snapshot of Part of Society,"For those interested in world events or the Middle East, I would recommend this book. It is a quick, enjoyable and often provocative read.Clearly, parts of the book that deal with sexuality and physical intimacy are designed to shock and provoke readers. These topics and the way they are handled, however, are far less provocative to Western readers who generally live in more liberal societies. That being the case, it was very interesting to see the germination of a jihadist, as well as the inter-play of colonialism, fundamentalism and authoritarianism in modern Cairo. Mr. Aswany is a talented story-teller and social oberserver. I also liked the ending, which demonstrated real optimism and the belief in finding truth and happiness despite troublesome surroundings."
4,An unknown perspective of Arab culture,The Yacoubian Building: A Novel provides the Western reader with an unfamiliar view of Arab culture. The characters of the story are artfully woven into a cohesive fabric with the aging Yacoubian Building in Cairo's old district forming the pillar around which their lives are wrapped. The metamorphesis of the young working class college student into A fundamentalist radical is a lucid revelation of how people can be changed incrementally from ordinary to extreme. A worthwhile read.
2,"If you've read Midaq Alley, don't bother reading this one","Very similar to Midaq Alley's theme, style and content. Makes it repetitive and boring, too."
3,moving and complex,"with few characters, the author depicts contemporean Cairo with a palette of nuances: tragic, nostalgic, cruel and soft at the same time."
3,Poor translation,"The translation is very unnatural and grated so much as I read that it became a major distraction as the infelicities were constantly striking me. One example taken at random: ""He walked slowly and deliberately away until he exited the room."" It would be more natural to write: ""He walked slowly and deliberately away and so out of the room"" or ""He turned and walked slowly and deliberately out of the room."""
3,Guilding Redux,"The Yacobian Building had an ""I've read this before"" feel. Naguib Mahfouz' classic ""Midaq Alley"" was of residents in a Cairo neighborhood; in this, Al Aswany's novel, they were based in the same building. In both cases, there is poverty, sex, class, corruption, striving - though the element of fundamentalism in Yacobian Building is much stronger.Both are a bit tedious to follow - maybe it's the reader's unfamiliarity with names, or the intertwining plots. Not the easy read some reviewers thought."
4,Excellent,"The Yacoubian Building is an excellent novel. The author presents many themes from Arab culture including, the veil, sexuality, homosexuality, nostalgia, etc. The characters are extremely rich and well developed. There are moments that are heart breaking and moments that defy belief. This novel is recommended for anyone who wants to read outside of `Western' literature. In many ways this novel opened my eyes to a world of literature that I have not considered."
3,Neither here nor there,"This is a book to take out of the library, because while it passes the time, you will never want to read it again."
2,Ghost Recon 2 not what you would expect,"Ghost Recon kicked ass for GC. Recon2, however sucks. You don't have the game play as before; now you can only control one soldier, which sucks. The load time, jeez.... The load time is the worst load load time I've seen since Mortal Kombat 3 first hit SNES.... The load time is horrible....the controls take some getting used to, but aren't too bad. The lack of expandibility for your soldiers is disappointing...In closing, this game is okay to rent, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. If, however, you want to buy it, email me, and I'll sell it for $30. I just bought it this week, and haven't played it too much.If you were looking forward to something simliar to what GR1 offered, you'll be very unpleasantly surprised...[...]"
5,Just as I wanted and in perfect condition!,I had a hard time locating the book I needed and Amazon had it at a great price. I had ordered it from a local book store but it had been weeks and never came so I found it at Amazon. Great place to find something you need.
5,A Must for All Homeschoolers!,This history book is a must for all home educators. This book and the corresponding workbook should serve as the starting point for your history lessons. Enjoy! HOMESCHOOLERS: READ MY OTHER REVIEWS!
4,Another good read!!,"Like the previous two volumes, we enjoyed SOTW Vol. 3. It is written in an interesting and engaging style. My younger children enjoyed it as much as my third grader. Susan Wise Bauer does a good job handling some rather difficult and unpleasant parts of History. She did choose to leave out a couple of topics, but explains her reasons at the beginning. My only complaint is the lack of church history that is covered. (There seems to be a decreasing amount of church history covered in each successive volume.)"
3,This item is good for basic processing only,"I have been using this food processor for around 6 months.Positive points- Better than a blender. Can make thick shakes, small pastes.- Smaller jar can be used for making powdered items but it should have like one cup of item to churn anything.Negative points- Once my wife tried making idli batter and the jar almost stuck to the machine. The plastic is not that great although it comes (or says) with a 300 W motor.Overall : Its a basic blender which can do little bit of food processing."
2,Not so good!,I purchased this for a Christmas gift and we finally started using it. What a disappointment! The ice didn't seem to get chopped up all the way. I had to re-open it and stir the contents to get it even remotely ready to be consumed. The same happened with the fruit. I chopped up fresh peaches and it was partially smooth and chunky. Based on the decent reviews I thought this would be a good choice. Spend the extra money to get a better one. You get what you pay for...
2,Don't buy - Can't blend,Loud. Annoying. Blade is far too small. Ineffective for frozen fruit. Barely blend. Not worth at any price. I returned mine and will stick with my Tribest and full size blender.
5,Smoothie maker,"I bought this to make smoothies, and it exceeds my expectations. The mug holds 3 cups, and quickly makes good creamy frozen smoothies with no frozen hunks of ice left."
2,Very limited uses,The blades are almost totally useless. I just wanted a simple smaller food processor to puree onions or make hummus.This device failed miserably
5,Great for smoothies,"I was looking at the Magic Bullet, those infomercials always having me wanting to buy the product. I caved this time and bought it only to have the cup handle fall off before I even got to use it. Then when I tried it for the first time it started leaking so I returned it to the store. My Mother has the Back to Basics blender and I tried hers before buying one. I was impressed with the way it crushes ice and doesn't leave little chunks in your smoothie. I also like the travel mugs that come with it. I have to give this one 5 stars."
1,"First use - Smoke poured out the bottom, but, Company Replaced it for Free!","The very first time I used this appliance, smoke poured out the bottom.But, the company is Sending me a New Unit Free of Charge. So, I am pleasantly surprised - and looking forward to trying again.Unfortunately, I couldn't increase my rating from 1 star up to at least 3 (for the great customer service) because amazon wouldn't let me do that."
1,"Loved It, but Scared","I loved the convenience of this little thing. It's simple, just a couple options, loved all the different pieces (two handled mugs for smoothies, one medium, one small) with the different lids/rim options. I got it because of the reviews instead of the magic bullet. But it tended to get a burning smell when used on the Pulse option. Then today it started smoking. I've had it for probably about 6 months, and only recently started using it regularly (2 weeks). Before that it was a couple times a month.I'm going to get a ""real"" blender, rather than one of these little ""convenience"" guys. Price is right, it's cute, and the idea is great, but I want something that can handle it's job without making me worry."
3,Doesn't Hold Up Long,Mine burned out after a year of use. I guess it couldn't handle more than a minute of blending.
2,Not like the origianl,"My parents have a Back to Basics blender that they bought at Macy's back about 4 yrs ago. The reason I liked there's so much was because it was not so loud and whipped up smoothies much better than this item. I assumed this was an original Back to Basics just like the one they purchased by the way they got it on sale for 19.99 than too. But it was not the same one it was bulky, loud and did not run near as smooth as the original Back to Basics. It may be the real one I am not sure but it surely did not run as nice as the older model my parents had."
2,so-so,"Several years ago I fell in love with the Magic Bullet. The problem was that the bullet conked out way too soon, and after the 2nd time I gave up on it.I thought this blender would be a good substitute. But it's bigger and clumsier, and the blender doesn't seem to work as well. I don't use it anymore, so I can't comment on its durability.Since I have a Vitamix, the most powerful, flexible blender in the world, I coughed up $130+ for the smaller container with wet blade and lid. Using the smaller container, the blender fits under my counter and it's easy to keep handy. In addition to pulverizing a carrot into juice, it can also chop nicely at low speed.So, I spent more money, but I'm happier."
4,Awesome lil' blender!,I have yet to use the chopper part but this blends up my protein shakes and smoothies in an instant! It crushes ice beautifully and is so handy to have the mixing container be the cup. I have only had this product for a short time but it is very handy and well worth the money spent!
3,"Great for the price, but couldn't handle all my Green Monsters","This is a pretty good personal blender. The price is way better than the competition, especially for the more powerful motor it comes with. The travel cup is larger than the last personal blender that I owned. The to-go lid is very secure and does not leak. It worked amazing at first, but after about a month it wasn't chopping as well as it did when I got it. I make Green Monster smoothies a few times a week, and it doesn't chop all of the greens anymore. You can hear it kind of chugging along and it's taking longer than the directions say it should to make my smoothies. I probably use it more than the average person, so I would think it would be a great value for the average don't drink smoothies three to four times a week person. I wanted something smaller and easier to travel with than a standard blender, but I'll have to stick with the big guy for now."
2,Difficult lids and loose sealers.,"I really needed a small blender for my countertop. Giving up my large glass container blender was difficult, but I really needed the space. Back to Basics looked like a good one. warning.. if you have weak or small hands, or arthritic hands, do not buy this one. I have strong hands and at times the jar is really difficult to open. My other complaint is that the rubber sealer has now decided to not stay in place so when I turn the jar over to blend it.. the liquid just pours out.All in all I would give this a rating of C."
1,Poor item,"This items was poorly designed, it got dead after using it the fourth time, it barely chops or cuts anything due to the fact the blades are at least 1"" from the sides of the container so food items get lodged in the side area and do not get chopped. also it is quite loud, i would not recommend it."
1,wrong plug!!,"I can't comment on the appliance as the one I received does not work in our electrical outlets. I bought an adapter online, which I received today, but it too doesn't fit. It seems there is more than one type of US plug?? (I'm in Australia). So disappointed - one month later and I'm still hanging out for a smoothie!"
2,Would Not Purchase Another,I purchased the exact same one from Lowe's three years earlier and works great. Product is not up to the same standard at the original from Lowe's. Which by the way was cheaper.
2,Worked for a minute,I loved this thing just long enough to be super bummed when it failed on me. Started smelling weird and burnt out pretty fast. I upgraded to a similar cuisinart model and have been very pleased.
4,Solid Blender,"Solid blender, but not spectacular - does a decent job for smothies. easy to clean. Good buy for the price you pay."
1,Broke after using twice!,"I made a total of two protein shakes with this product and it burned out, stopped working completely! What a piece of junk. I had an under $20 blender that worked for nearly three years and this I buy this and it breaks down after two shakes?? Give me a break. Save your money, do NOT buy this product!!"
1,Missing Parts,Received this blender.. The reason I bought the Plus was that it came with allot of extras. Supposed to be a 11 piece system mine was only nine pieces. It was missing the Two comfort fit drinking rims. The hassle of returning this to amazon is just not worth it so I will suck it up and evaluate whether I should do anymore business with them. The don't offer a problem resolution option just return the product.
5,Great little item,"I bought mine 3 years ago and it's worked fine since. About a year after purchase I ended up buying the extra 2 mug set. Now I guess I just have to buy the 12 & 18 oz cups and chopping blade, you can do that at the website. I don't mind, this appliance is the best personal blender I've used."
1,poor design,I tried this as a lower cost alternative to the Magic Bullet. I regret my choice. It does not blend well. I constantly have to open it up and scrape down the sides because the mixing powder for my smoothies gets stuck in the ridges of the mixing container/mugs. I also find it very difficult to clean. The plastic O ring keeps coming out and it is very difficult to push it back into position. I noticed the Magic Bullet is on sale at a local store. I'll give that a try and see if Goodwill will take this useless paperweight.
2,doesn't last long . . .,"After not much use it started to make noise and smell from wire insulation (in the machine) burning. They have farmed out warranty service operations, which so far is dysfunctional."
2,Not a great product,"I've had this for about 3 months now, got it at Target. I've found the design poor, the plastic gears are grinding themselves up. I have white powder (ground gear) all over the base. I am throwing this away. I am trying a different brand. It also comes with unuseful attachments. I am a person who has a berry smoothie every morning and I find this thing a chore and I hate using it. It's loud, as most blenders are, but with all that loud noise is inconsistent power. Not reccomended."
1,Paid $35 for 3 shakes,This product can not handle anything more than powder and even that it doesn't do well. I made a powder shake and 2 shakes with frozen fruit and it is no longer workable. The plastic piece on the bottom spins but no longer spins the blade. It's like a stripped screw.It says its great for shakes and ice crushing....nope!I really wish I had gone with a different product.
3,Review of Back to Basics Blender Express,"The blender works ok. However, it takes longer to blend small amounts of semi liquid food than did my old Magic Bullet. It is made more sturdily than the MB, so should last longer. I like the fact that the material that the cups are made of is better health-wise."
3,"As the name suggests, it's good for basics","This machine is OK, as long as you don't need it for something hard to blend (e.g: Ice cubes). The blades are not very sharp, and the size is smaller than what I expected. You can't rely on it to grind effectively, but it's still good in making juices and mixes.If you seek something 'basic', this blender should be your choice."
3,Its good for smoothies..,"I got this as a gift, so it doesn't seem as bad. I tried to make salsa, but if there isn't enough liquid, all of the ingredients get stuck on top and the blade just keeps spinning without chopping anything. You have to keep shaking the whole thing to get the food to come down. It wouldn't even chop the garlic clove.It blends smoothies pretty well and chops the ice nicely but you still have to give it a few shakes."
4,I use this all the time,"This a good product that I use almost daily for smoothies and grinding coffee beans. The comments about stuff put in first tends not to blend as well (e.g., protein powder) but I just put it in more toward the last and it does just fine. When I first started using it many months ago it smelled like it was going to burn out but it has been chugging along just fine. I am very happy with this product."
2,Not as good as the Magic Bullet,I got this set because I had and liked the Magic Bullet and needed another set. This machine doesn't work as well because the blades are not as sharp and they are raised from the platform and when I used it there were chunks of food stuck underneath the blades.
3,Doesn't Live Up to the Description,"I was very disappointed with the functionality of this blender. I really like the travel mugs and the smaller containers, but this thing doesn't even crush ice to make smoothies! I have to put the ice in a baggie and crush it pretty well before adding it to the blender. Blends very nicely with things that don't include ice. I almost returned it, but didn't think it would be worth the hassle."
1,smell of overheated metal parts and leaky elements,"This product works nowhere near as well as they make it look on T.V. unless you like the smell of overheated metal parts being overworked to try to achieve the results seen on T.V. and leaky elements, I wouldn't recommend this at all!"
5,TIE vs Y wing!,"In this awsome set you get to polit a TIE Fighter and a Y Wing right from Starwars! Including Darth Vader a Rebel Polit and a red R2-D2 named R5-D4, A rare droid that is similar to R2-D2! The TIE Fighter wings can be made curved or just flat. The set gives pictures of how to make large space ship, a small scout ship, a small vech, a wall rammer and a full life size lightsaber!!! The down side on that is that it doesnt have pieces to make the stick but all you need is some blue green or red blocks to make it complete! It also! gives you a little comic book in the manuel featuring the TIE Fighter, Y Wing and the other items I told you about. Great for a Starwars starter or any Lego buff!"
1,Unusable,I bought this to use for my dry erase white board. It was too flimsy to hold my fairly light board.This easel requires assembly.
1,Very bad parody !,"..This CD is just 14 tracks of joking at MODERN TALKING.People, do NOT buy this!!!.."
3,Premium LP comes to CD,The title derives from the fact that this album was recorded asa premium LP for Hires Root Beer. For [one dollar]... and a bottle cap ora Hires label you could get the LP mailed to you. This is a\good collection of songs from the early 60s. Blossom is backedby a rhythm section. Her voice was much higher then. I preferher Daffodil Recordings. Blossom fans (I'm one of them) willwant to have this. Sound is very good. This is the second timethis has been reissued on CD. Her other album recorded about thesame time is the Capitol MAY I COME IN? which I prefer to this one.Blossom is one of a kind and one of the few singers left who nurtures the popular song as we oldsters like them.
5,BROOKLYNS IN THE HOUSE,The real 8-Mile indeed. This film is completely void of the 50 million dollar production value of Eminem's 8-Mile but the skills of the lead rapper and the various contestants he battles speaks volume.Definately a worthwhile purchase for any hip hop junky.Peace!!!
4,Rap War Review,"It reminds me of Eight Mile, but this movie was worth the purchase. The ending left something to be desired, though. I wish it showed what happened at the next competition."
4,I'm not glad at all,"well the first collection of videos from Jenny, but i'm not glad at all because at least one video is missingit's the video from "" Baila "" wich you can find it on the feelin so good DVD and the song is part from the music from the heart soundtrack, and una noche mas it's not full included.the other bad things are> why include the original version of baby i luv u on the EP and a really bad remix of All i have??? she shoul've included a new song at least or better mixes, and of course a new artwork, new photos etc.. but Jenny I Still luv u"
5,Te Amo Jennifer!,"This CD/DVD is fantastic. It's great to see all Jenny's videos from 'On the Six' to 'J.Lo' to 'J to Tha L-O' and 'This is me...Then', and the remixes are amzing, specially the latin remix for ""Jenny from the Block"""
2,"I enjoy watching Her Move,Musically I keep Her on Mute",this was a Good Deal&She has a couple of tracks that have decent Production.truth be told some of Her Songs ain't half bad but She can't Sing to save Her life.vocally She is one of the Worst Ever.but the Videos make up for that limitation.this is a Good Value though.
4,The Reel Me,"I bought this set @ Target mainly out of curiosity because when J-Lo was really hot in the music industry, I was not paying attention to and therefore missed all of her videos except the first for ""If You Had My Love"". Overall I'm happy with the purchase - J-Lo is one of those lucky people who got a record deal based on her popularity in another medium, she used Puffy & his connections to release some good dance/pop music. Because she is not a great vocalist, her videos HAD to be creative so that fans and those curious about her would support her music endeavors. That's what I like most about the videos, they are eye-catching & fun!I'd definitely recommend this set to her hard core fans and also those who, like me, may have missed seeing her videos.On the cd side, the only song I truly enjoy listening to is the Baby, I Love You (R. Kelly remix)"
2,This is the one they showed at Scruples.,"If you remember the surfing tape they showed on the T.V.s at Scruples (the club in Waikiki a block from the strip)from 1999 to 2002, the fifth movie on this DVD is that tape."
2,"O.K, when it works","This is an unreliable unit. I bought it for interview work, but I noticed that the audio cut in and out. When the Receiver looses reception, (which it did sometimes within 10 ft.), it would not pick up the signal again, thus losing all audio. If you are on a budget, and are in a controlled environment (with headphones) the audio is pretty good, but just make sure you are able to catch it."
1,Do not waste your money.,"I tried this wireless lapel mic with the portable PA systems. With new batteries installed, the range of the mic is about five feet at best before there is loss of signal. This product did not work and I would not recommend it. You pay for what you get."
2,Cannot recommend,I bought this to use it for classroom lecture. The receiver is good but the microphone is just a waste. You have to really put it close to your mouth to be heard. Forget about clipping it to lapel. However the transmitter and receiver are good if you can find a compatible microphone.
1,Sold it on ebay,Didn't really work at all. Sound was bad but I wasn't really too mad since it was less than 20 bucks. Whatever.
3,Lapel Mic - You get what you pay for,"This product is exactly what I expected, a very inexpensive lapel mic. Easy to use but don't expect broadcast quality. I bought two and with out my asking, they sent them with different frequencies. Well done."
3,Effective and Cheap - No Mute,"For the price, you get what you pay for.This is a very inexpensive wireless lapel mic, and it works. The sound quality is a little fuzzy and on rare occasion there was static, but for how little the device costs I'd recommend it if you were in a financial pinch.My biggest complaint is that there was no mute button. You could turn the device off, but that caused a loud buzz to come out of the speakers. You could unplug your mic from the transmitter, but who wants to walk around with an unplugged cord flailing about?It comes in a plastic-like case, but I tossed it and store the mic/transmitter along with the rest of my audio equipment. The case itself was too bulky.I will probably soon buy one of the more expensive lapel mics soon."
1,I've been had by a crummy product,"The product arrived in the afternoon, and shortly after I learned why it was so cheap. There were some reviews that stated that these at least worked. However, I found that to not be true. First, I took the battery covers off of the receivers and neither one would go back on with the battery installed. Then, without much force, the flimsy little tabs on the covers both broke as I tried to slide them back on. Seriously?!? Much to my surprise they actually powered up and appeared to be Tx*ing/Rx*ing, but neither even mustered any static when plugged in. I'm technologically inclined and I tried everything to make them work.... No go.My recommendation... Buy an Azden mic instead!"
5,Good Workout,I love this DVD. It provides a very good targeted workout to all areas of your body. Even though I'm not losing any more weight my body is changing & looking better. My husband loves my thighs & rear end after doing this workout. And it doesn't take very long to see results.
3,Make time for excercise,"I excercised with Denise 20 years ago while watching her Get Fit program.My home excercise routine was getting boring so I started excercising with her Body Makeover Mix DVD and it's good for me because I am in good shape so I am flexible enough to keep up with her program, so I am able to keep toned and have fun. Of course I will have to purchase another excecise DVD soon to add to my collection."
4,Practical,"An immensely practical guide for teachers new to multimodality or afraid of it. The design of the pages is appalling, but if you can look past that, there's some helpful information here."
3,Excellent recordings sullied by mediocre sound,"I love the great symphonies of Mendelssohn, they are a remarkable series of works that every lover of classical music would enjoy.This particular collection of symphonies is wonderfully performed. The tempo is even, the harmonies quite clear.Unfortunately, the recording is less than ideal. Performed in a grand hall, the orchestra [and thereby the sound] is distant. Some of the finer nuances of the symphonies are muffled by the mediocre recording itself.Mendelssohn's music is characterized not only be ingenious techniques, but also by inventive orchestration. Long runs passed among the oboe, clarinet, and flute [requiring exceptional skill among the performers] are mostly inaudible because of the distance of the music.It is to be sorely regretted that this recording suffers from the recording issues. Otherwise it would be one of the finest performances of the Mendelssohn Symphony Cycle, in my opinion.I would suggest that you seek another set."
1,Great music spoiled by poor recording and sound,"I am a great fan of Mendelssohn and his two piano concertos are one my most favorites in terms of the dynamism, tempo and emotion. The Symphonies are also terrific. While Kurt Masur may be a very well known conductor which prompted me to buy this collection, the recording and sound is subpar. Music is never enjoyable with a poor recording. Don't buy this, it is a waste of money. There are other better recordings of his symphonies by Karajan (symphonies) and Murray Perahia (concertos)."
2,bad quality,"I didnt like the product because when the fan turns it makes lot of noise and the quality of the product is really low. The fragrance is supposed to be ""new car"" smell, if any company produce a car that smells like this, I am sure nobody will buy that car. It was a filler item for me to get free shipping, try some different auto fragrances."
1,GE BAD CHOICE,had phone almost 2 years they are very very badd phones please dont buy!!! get panasonic better phones .
2,Skagen watch - Not too happy,I was totally surprised once I opened the box. Watch size was much bigger than I had expected. Watch dimenstion description has to be updated properly for rectangular watches so it gives clear idea on watch size.
4,Excellent intro to the dialect for intermediate students,"As you can see by the other reviews, this is not a book for beginners. I wouldn't recommend it for folks new to Iraq or to the Middle East -- there's not enough grammar and no Arabic script.However, it's one of the few up-to-date resources on the Iraqi dialect available, and I found Prof. Alkalesi's work invaluable in my preparation for work in Iraq.Note that some of the materials are based around cheerful, tourist-style dialogues. That won't might help you order masguuf (an Iraqi fish) but it won't help you interview folks about their daily lives (i.e. no security, no jobs, no water, no electricity ...) And good luck trying to check in to the Rashid Hotel (one of the chapters).If you are interested in Iraq and know enough Arabic to transcribe the script, you'll find this a great resource."
1,Buy it and retain your illiteracy,"When I first saw this book I was excited to see a text book that specialized in a dialect, whcih has more similarities to the countries that I have studied (Levantine) than Egpytian Arabic. However, I was very disappointed to learn that the book does not use the Arabic alphabet. What the heck?Granted, spelling is still difficult for me in this language, but I am not going to lay out money for a book which will not help me learn to read like the locals in the dialect that it purports to teach. I thought the point of books was to read. With this approach, that of ignoring the alphabet, you can finish a course and still be an illiterate in the langauge."
2,Ok...,"I had high hopes for this CD set, based on all the previous glowing reviews. But, to be honest, I am disappointed. I cannot deny the technical expertise of the pianist. However, everything sounds too fast..almost like ""Presto"" is the marking for each piece. It sounds...rushed. Anyways, I will keep the set for reference purposes, but, my search for a personal favorite Beethoven cycle continues."
4,Awesome live album!,Only the 2nd live Culture album I have ever found... the set list on this one is fantastic! Culture is always great live. Also recommend: Cultural Livity.
3,"Ok, but I like Move Free Advanced plus MSM better.","Ok, but I like Move Free Advanced plus MSM better."
3,Product not up to my expectations,"Pot was not made as solidly as it appeared, and I felt it was less quality than I had paid for. I was impressed with the seller, however. When I expressed my disappointment, they were promptly willing to make it right. And they did."
1,Not 18/10 !,I bought this elsewhere where it was advertised as 18/10. It is clearly labeled 18/8 which will not work on induction cooktops.
2,Ruined Gift,"I bought this double boiler as a gift, and when it arrived the glass lid was completely shattered. Due to the way the product is packaged, I didn't realize this until the person was already opening it. Tiny bits of glass went everywhere.I can't hold it entirely against the product itself, but the item was never used. If you buy this, be very careful when opening, the glass lid is not properly protected or padded."
5,Good adult therapy,"I was looking for a good ""adult therapy"" style coloring book, and this is exactly what I was hoping for. Since I can't draw, I satisfy my creative yearning with coloring. The pictures have a enough detail to be absorbing, but not so much detail as to be tedious. The paper and granularity of the drawings are perfect for crayons, which I prefer over markers or pencil. My husband still teases me for playing with crayons, but at least my subjects are adult now."
4,Careful!,"I think we can all agree that, although he depicted some perfectly pleasant scenes of quaint countryside and rural life, Van Gogh's approach to paint application and colour was way off. How many times did he spoil, say, a nice waving wheat scene with turmultuous swirling colours, giving a dark psychological insight into a tormented psyche, at odds with the scene depicted? He couldn't even paint a nice starry sky without expressing through colour, texture and dynamic motion a radical and unique vision of personal torment, at odds with the artistic conventions of the time. This book, then, is a godsend; a chance to rectify Van Gogh's stylistic mistakes in the area of colour application, while retaining the charming scenes of the French countryside.A word of warning, however: this book is really not suitable for children or similarly impressionable people. I gave it to a young nephew who, after spending quite some time colouring in the nice birds over the wheat field, cut his ear off!"
5,favorite,I am very happy with my purchase and has quickly become my favorite cd's in my collection. I was very surprised at how fast I received the shipment and will definately order again.
3,A lot of songs to choose the great ones out of,"Some of the songs really do not show of the qualities of her abilities. Personal preference cuts out 50%. There are better ones available, which have greater recordings on them. Still not a bad purchase"
2,For a very petite lady or a girl only.,"I do not like this necklace or the earrings that go with it. Partly my fault, I did not register how tiny they are. ""Grace and elegance accentuate this brass colored silhouette."" That may be true, but these old eyes would need a magnifying glass to establish the accuracy of that. I am not being sarcastic, please understand. This necklace and earring set is very, very small. This is jewelry that is appropriate for a young girl. For all but the most petite ladies, the proportions would be wrong. I finally found the words I want to use to describe the set: it lacks presence.I am going to give them as a gift to the young, very young, lady next door. On her, they should be in proper proportion to stand out and have presence."
3,horse movie,a bit slow but still enjoyable. this is always a good series for horse lovers. be happy to watch it again
2,burned a little,I wasn't crazy about this. It burned me a little. My husband was fine with it. But we found that Pjur worked a lot better.
5,Emotionally Driven,"At the End picks up where Rapture left off. Granted Iio makes some of the best radio friendly techno arround, its always the remixers that breathe dance floor life into songs. 'At the End' is no exception. The formula is simple. Take gorgeous vocals, match them with an amazing and emotinally driven beat, and you get what is sure to be another dance floor hit. While the radio edit is good, its the remixes that are simply amazing. Like the Riva Remix of Rapture, the Saeed And Palash Remix pushes song onto dance floors with a great balance of bump, trance, and vocals. This is one of the songs that gets people crotch to crotch and dancing. Good Job Iio...we're waiting on your album release."
1,ridiculously cheap and thin,Used to live in Seattle and have gotten lots of disposable ponchos over the years. This one tears just coming out of package and opening it up. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!
1,Song titles listed here do not match actual album pictured,"I can't say much about the industrial ""Killing Floor"" album that goes with the songs in the amazon listing above, but I think I can help resolve the dilemma spoken about in the other reviews. If you will look at the album back cover image I just uploaded, you will see the song titles listed in this amazon listing DO NOT match the 60's/70's UK band shown on the cover. So...refer to the other amazon listing for this CD, if you want ""the right thing."""
4,Cool obscure British blues/rock,"This was an influencial album on my own guitar playing when I was a kid. The production on this is pretty shabby, but the guitar work of Mick Clarke is not to be missed. Mick is now fronting the Mick Clarke band with several good albums under his belt now. Also noteworthy is the piano work of Lou Martin who went to play with Rory Gallagher. The band is solid, the rhythm section is great. The only downside is the vocalist/harmonica player, Bill Thorndycraft who is not a particularly great singer or harp player. The lyrics are also lame in spots as well, but the musicianship makes up for it. Despite the downsides, I consider this a must have for any fan of British blues."
4,you're both confused,the reviews for both KILLING FLOORs are displayed under each album. the other two reviewers should note this before arguing. the KILLING FLOORs are good bands. you can both spread your hate elsewhere... feel ashamed
5,Excellent easy to use computer with good sound,My eMac has been problem free and is delightful to use.I have had another eMac before; but I gave it to my Mom and I bought another one.I have friends with them too. I used them in the universities too. I had good experiences with the eMac.They are heavy though so it is a desktop computer not easy to move around. It has a big screen and good speakers and a good music system with itunes. I am completely happy with my eMac. I have a Gigga bite of memory chip in it. It is plenty for every thing I do. I usually have mutliple browsers open too.I use DSL with my eMac and it is fast. I have not had to buy much software; but I am thinking about buying Quicken software. It is an excellent computer. I sometimes use emacs when I play around with computer programing. It works good. I recommend this computer. I bought my eMac computers new; but I bought them with the insurance with apple incase anything went wrong. I did not have anything go wrong with them though.
4,Yay Doctor Who no. II,I can't tell how much I enjoyed this. I am a fan of Patrick Toughton's work and would love to see more of his work available soon.
5,Tomb of the Cybermen - Classic Who,"Tomb of the Cybermen, although it looks out of date, is the classic ""monster"" Doctor Who episode. ( it is after all 30 years old ). Once thought gone forever, it has been returned from Hong Kong and no fan should be without this collectible delicable."
3,They're baaaack...,"This would be season 5.1-5.4 (Story 37). This is the first DVD set currently available to see Doctor 2 in action. I like him better than Doctor 1, but that's just preference. He has a bit of a different acting style and was friendlier than Doctor 1 portrayed the character."
3,"Spooky, Wonderful, Classic Who","This serial really is dark, eerie, and menacing. The cybermats made me tingle with anticiplation as they went in for the kill. The tall cyber leader was really ominous and well played.I always jump when Jamie is trying to get out of the tomb when the huge cybermen lumber towards him. It gets me every time.A perfect gem and must-have video!"
2,Enough with the doubledipping,This is not a review of an excellent Doctor Who story but the fact that this is the third reissue of an earlier Doctor Who DVD by the BBC in 2012. The BBC has released almost all the Doctor Who stories that still exist so now I guess they will just repackage their earlier releases and just add some extra special features. The least they could do is release the final 7 or 8 Doctor Who stories that are left instead of dragging things out with releases of previous material.
2,A classic I think not!,"The Tomb Of The Cybermen is regarded as one of the very best Doctor Whos there are, but when I saw it, I was amazed at how bad it was. The main problem is that the whole story is layered on three sets - two rooms, and the tomb. Them aside, the story goes virtually nowhere. For some reason, the Cybermen do duck impressions all the time. The cast are predictably bad (especially the ""american"" captain) and the plot is quite silly..."
2,Tomb Of The Stupidmen,"This is the absolute worst ever Doctor Who adventure I've ever seen. First of all What kind moron goes looking for the Cybermen. I got all my liking of the Cybermen from Earthshock which was great, but this, this is a horrible adventure. All Cybermen except the Cyber Controller did not talk. There was enough stuff to keep you watching it but not enough to keep you from dozing off or something. Overall this is the worst Doctor Who ever."
2,cheap,"This has only two things going for it: a great title and the Cybermen themselves. The story is terrible, the acting weak and the very cheap sets sets look like they were left over from an Ed Wood film.Money was missing from this one and it shows. You can do better."
1,"I'm sorry, but it's the truth","Judging from Amazon reviews, there's nary an episode of Dr. Who that deserves less than 4 stars. If only it were true! If only everything could be a classic. But alas, even with Dr. Who, ""90% of everything is garbage.""Like much poor quality TV, this one is ""geared towards kids."" Theme song notwithstanding, it bears no resemblance to the better episodes from the Tom Baker era. The central conceit here is a bunch of lackwits who, having stumbled upon a tomb full of computer equipment, can't resist throwing random levers and pushing random buttons while the Doctor stands back saying ""Don't touch that! You shouldn't have touched that!"" Inevitably, one of the levers rejuvenates the cybermen. It just gets worse from there. Abysmal.Buy it today and rue for yourself!"
4,Great 2nd Doctor story,"I recommend this story and DVD to all Doctor Who fans. Very few stories still exist with Patrck Troughton as the 2nd Doctor.The story has the obvious cybermen in it but they are not the main villians,humans are,which is a nice twist well thought out. The effects are not up today's but that only adds to the charm. Since it is in black and white you really just end up enjoying a nostalgic reminder of 60's T.V."
3,I like Pat and Frazer but please give them what they deserve,"I get the impression that the BBC was anxious to throw a bone out and did not ""remaster"" this title as it could have. There seems to be this noise that permeates the show that reminds me of the sound that one hears when inside the TARDIS console room. I found that same din on The Invasion too. It is a distracting effect that should have been addressed before offering this to the public, what with all the tech toys around now to combat this kind of sound and video from the dark ages of black and white television. I have seen Charlie Chan DVDs that look and sound better."
5,"THE DOCTOR, CYBERMEN...CLASSIC WHO ON DVD!","Thanks to a discovery in Hong Kong in 1992, ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" is now the earliest ""Doctor Who"" of the Patrick Troughton era to remain completely intact. And it is a great adventure. The scenes with the Cybermen are quite frightening, but Troughton's humour keeps it from becoming too scary. With a great supporting cast and some fairly decent visual effects, ""The Tomb of the Cybeermen"" is a treasure that belongs in anyone's collection of ""Who"" episodes. The extras on this disc are little, but totally worthwhile!Program Grade: A+DVD Grade: A-Overall Grade: A"
3,Not Clear re: christian based material,"If you are looking for information re: Emotional Intelligence, based in the christian view, this is a good book. I was not looking for that perspective when I purchased this book on line. The editorial review did not note that this is a christian based book and is somewhat misleading. It is also not possible to tell that this is a christian based book by the cover that is displayed on line. I would not have purchased this book if I was aware that it was christian based."
1,Emotional Intelligence: 101 Ways to Bring Out the Best in our Children and Yourself,"This book, copyright 1999, is a bit outdated and offered no new ideas on the hot topic of emotional intelligence. The books message is ""Love your child well."" This is a noble concept but for my adopted child I needed ""meatier"" information."
4,Check your software titles!,Product is as expected but be sure to check your own software for TRUE 64 bit support!
1,Run Away!!!,"Do not buy this product. Only one company makes anti-virus software for this OS, and most printers do not make drivers compatible with this OS. Microsoft no longer actively supports this product, if you buy it good luck and god speed."
4,much stable than vista,"Many of us are surprised by Microsoft who ditched their stable and fast XP 64. Instead, they pushed unstable vista on the market before it was done. For programming purpose, XP 64 is a much better choice. I've heard lots of studios in special effects industry kept their old Win32 to avoid all the hassles brought by Vista in their render farms."
4,Smooth Sailing,"One of the entries in the Elemental Chill catalogue. Earth and Air are the standouts, with Water and Fire satisfactory, featuring more jazz and funk vibes."
4,Shock pretty good!,Not bad for the price. It works better than the Sega one and it doesn't overshake and mess up your VMU! I am gonna get another one for my 2nd player controller!
3,"Where's the Mac support, Aspyr?","Sims 2 Pets is an endearing expansion for the Sims franchise, but Mac users beware: although Aspyr has released a patch for the Windows platform to fix the game's many bugs, there is currently (4/6/07) no patch available for the Mac. Errors include taking a puppy or kitten to work if you're interacting with them when the carpool shows up, children floating when chatting with each other, and -- when your pets retire from a job -- your Sims are silently demoted in their career path.Please release a Mac patch, Aspyr."
4,"Good, but needs some work","I just bought the Sims 2 Pets, and I've really enjoyed it. However, it has a lot of bugs. I've noticed a decrease in performance quality since I installed it. It's not anything super serious, but you can tell. I also had some trouble with Sims faces' being different if I altered a pet profile last in the create-a-new-family section. Weird. It also doesn't have as many new objects as I would like (new clothes, hairstyles, etc.), but the stuff that is new is pretty cool. It's also really fun to give your pets jobs. So overall, don't be scared to get the game, but also keep an eye out for a patch that will correct the problems. I haven't been able to find one yet."
5,"Im a PC owner, and I LUV it","soooooo.this game rox my sox off! im in luv with animals and i volunteer at an animal shelter, and i adore this game. ive always dreamed of a game where u could breed puppies and kittens and create new breeds and whatnot, and if uve had that dream too, this game's for you!"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with the sims 2 pets when I got it. I am a big animal lover, but this just isn't worth it. When I got the game, I didn't know that I couldn't control the pets. You can teach them tricks, but they never come in handy. I wanted to make a kitten but I couldn't because you can't make baby animals, the adult animals have to mate, and you can't control that. It gets really annoying, and all they pretty much do is sleep, eat, and walk around."
4,Great Game,like the game. But watch your memory or it will go slow. And be careful of what you download-may slam your game. And Only download a little at a time. And keep notes of the file names in case you need to remove it.
4,A great legacy,"Adhesive were never well-known outside of Europe. Out of their 5 proper releases only one (""sideburner"") was ever available stateside. Sure ""sideburner"" is a great album, but it only hints at the greatness to come two years later. A band who would go on to release what I feel are two of the best punk albums in history. (""from left to right"" and ""we got the beat"") And unlike 95% of their peers, Adhesive never went stale, always reinventing themselves over their 8 year span. And finally laying the band to rest when they felt the time was right. I guess they accomplished what they had set out to do: Create intelligent, moving and memorable music while keeping things fun too. I do wish some worthy label would re-release their stuff to the rest of the world. Adhesive could stand the test of time if only more people knew they existed.--You can check out 3/4 of Adhesive now playing in The Indecision Alarm."
4,killer,"This cd is crazy, Its exactly what punk should be in this day in age, its too expensive though, but then again, isnt every cd?killer cd, definetely a good buy for the ounk fan"
4,siiiiicck!,"Adhesive is a must have, coming from Sweden much like Millencolin and Pridebowl, these guy can't be beat! Fast catchy songs that you will play over and over. ""On a Pedestal"" is a good one, fast beat and good lyrics, throw your stupid ass pennywise and blink in the trash boys and girls, cause it's all about Adhesive!"
3,Review on Home Disaster Book,This book covers the basics. It also gives you some insight on new ways of looking at common issues. It is a handy book to have around.
4,Thought Provoking Children's Book,"Charlie's Head is a better-than-average book for children. The illustrations are colorful, funny, and very well done. The story, about the stuff that comes out of Charlie's head, is unique, entertaining, and bound to stimulate the imagination and creative juices of all kids who read it. Should be a successful series. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."
4,"Beautiful Poems, Mysterious Poet","I greatly admire Fairchild's poetry, but I only came across him recently when I read ""Old Men Playing Basketball"" (from _The Art of the Lathe_) in Billy Collins's anthology _Poetry 180_. After buying _The Art of the Lathe_, I became a convert to Fairchild's midwestern, blue-collar ethos, strained through one of the most finely balanced poetic lenses I have encountered in a long time. I went on to buy other works, and my admiration has only increased. I can find out very little about Fairchild, however. He seems to have started his poetic career late; at least the one photo I have seen of him shows him as an older man.Fairchild's poetry is reminiscent at some times of Whitman, at others of James Wright, about whom he has written poems. Fairchild is an accessible poet, not one of those who are so anxious to ""make it new"" that they fall into obscurities that make their poetry more frustrating than enriching. Any work by Fairchild is worth looking into.Bob Champ"
3,Calico Dance,This book made me aware of the little-noticed Thirty Years' War. I had no idea of man's inhumanity to man during this period in European history. The book stirred my imagination as I was placed with the family into tragedy after tragedy. The story is told very simply. I was disappointed that the book was so short as I could have stayed with the family in more of their adventures.
4,A Long Tradition,"Recognizable male choral sounds are found in Russia, the nation of Georgia, and Corsica. They are as distinctive as Gregorian chant. The polyphony of Corsica, until recently, has been a male domain. The men would gather in a horseshoe, often an ear cupped with hand, and sing both lithurgical and secular tunes traditionally without instrument accompaniment. The group A Filetta is the most recorded. This album presents the six men of Voci de Corsica. There is much dignity in their songs, but after a while tedium sets in, since the rhythm and tone of the many somber sacred hymns and laments are nearly uniform. Joy and celebration seems lacking. Still, this is fine recording and demonstration of the vocal art of Corsica."
3,Good quality but somewhat monotonous.,"Good recording of classic Corsican polyphony. Good voices. All the tracks are very similar, however. Needs some variety. Interesting music."
2,Try Something else FIRST,"This is the game that comes with the LEAPSTER TV that my parents purchased for my 3 year old. After about 15 minutes of trying to hit the letters and knocking down jugs...she gets a little restless. I think it is a great way to get young children to recognize letters, but thats about it. I am NOT going to take the game back; I plan on trying other leapster games, because I've read that there are some good ones out there!However,this is NOT one that I would purchase."
1,Awful,"The graphics are 1980's at best. The game-play is poor too. I will admit we only spent 30 minutes in 3 different game areas before we decided to turn it off and return it, so other areas may be better. On the pinata game if you make the same mistake twice one of your lives is taken away. I don't find that to be a positive message.An awful game. It is more of a quiz of concepts than learning. And using it on the Leapster TV requires using the stylus rather than the joystick. Not worth the money."
1,There are better games out there,"We bought this game along with the leapster for our daughter last year at Christmas when she was 3 1/2...She loves Dora and she really tried with this game, but the only thing she would really play was the rabbit jumping on the letters and after awhile it would get too hard for her. I certainly don't think they made this game easy enough or enjoyable enough. If your child really likes Dora and Diego, I would suggest the Diego game. Not only is it eaiser to understand, the graphics are better and it's a lot more fun. My daughter has played the Diego game more in the few weeks we've had it than she has with this game."
2,Dora Pinata Party,Not one of Leapsters best games. My son normally enjoys all of the Leapster games but this one... Just wasn't much to it. Only two games - hit the letters with the stick and hit the correct pin with a ball. I kept thinking we were missing something...but that's it. You earn tickets but can't use them for anything.
1,Very upset Dora fan!,"This game is one of the worst Leapster games available, bad graphics and complicated for a child to play."
1,"frustrating, not fun","My 4 year old loves dora, but this has been her least favorite leapster game. All of the areas she has tried have been frustrating. The academic content is simple and Dora is a toddler/preschooler character, but the difficulty of use makes it unsuitable for that age group. In general the arcade style leapster games are not my daughter's favorites, but this one is the worst."
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,"This is a terrible CD. Thomas Erak has no idea what the hell he is doing. He just turns up the distortion and screams. The only thing solid in this band is the drummmer. Don't waste your time with this album, you can hear everything they ripped off and more by just listening to the Blood Brothers or the Mars Volta. Totally un-original. I can't stress this enough."
5,3 guys playing a 6 man show,"When I heard this CD, I was blown away by the beautiful, tripled-layered guitar work. Of course, i thought that since the band only had three guys, this type of music could not be recreated live. How wrong i was. When I saw them on stage, I realized that the guitar player/lead singer was capable of handling four people's work at once. What he did was record and loop his riffs on a loop station while he was playing, so eventually he had 2 guitar loops going at once. He would then play another riff over that while screaming. He is the best rock guitar player I have ever seen or heard. Dare I say, these guys have a lot more raw talent than their influence, The Mars Volta (although the Mars Volta has a lot more production spiff)."
4,Good Stuff,"Equal parts, Botch, Blood Brothers, and The Mars Volta. So much so that it makes the Blood Brothers last album irrelevent and makes up for the dissapointment of the Fripp Covers of De-Loused. Buy it and be glad you heard it first"
3,"Yeah, they've got talent...","This band does have a lot of talent, especially their blazing guitarist, but I can't get into these guys. While the guitars are fast, very few of his riffs actually stand out to me and I'm not feeling the way the songs are arranged. But, I think these guys have quite a bit of potential.Check out the LATEST Hot Cross, Fair Trades and Fairwells. It has much less of the back up vocals that are on Cryonics. But give that record a few listens, let it grow on you and it is much more rewarding then this."
5,blowing me away,Mines still in the mail i've been listening to this album off pieced together mp3s and im just amazed. I love shreaders like slayer and fall of troys guitarist is near that level but in front of a its own musical styling. These guys are incredible and they are all 18 or younger. Its scary how good these guys will be.
3,Respond Vol. II,"Good set of female Urban-alternative-Folk music.A set of talented singer-songwriters.For me it was an interesting compilation of music... slowly becoming a top in my music collection.Don't let that comment full you... if you enjoy Alternative-Folk music (which may also be called new-wave country, progressive country) then you just find find this collection tugging at your,too."
5,Stunning!! Best of my mystery list..,"I came across this book from another mystery book, which ranks the former as the best. Curiously, I got one and started challenging myself with full attention and judgement. I had to admit I failed.. when I saw Druly Lane finally pushed himself out of the case. Highly recommended.. it's OUT of my expectation, but it's GREAT!!"
2,Worth Seeing Only For Lupe Velez,"I got a kick out of this film for the first half of it, but it got so stupid with the main characters that I had a hard time finishing it. However, it was still worth a look to see Lupe Velez.I had read what a strange character Velez was in real life, and that she was sexy woman, so at least I have now seen her. She was a very pretty lady and not shy, either. This film just made it under the wire before the Hays Code came along, so Lupe showed us about all of her [...]. If this film had been made a year later, she would have been forced to cover up.Stu Erwin plays the boxer ""Joe Palooka."" He plays a really inept fighter and stupid guy in general who is endearing for awhile but wears thin. The same goes for Jimmy Durante's role of fight manager ""Knobby Walsh.""Anyway, this is typical early '30s material which means very corny and dated in the humor and romance department, sometimes hilarious and a bit racy."
1,Copy Cat and Rip Off,This book was a rip off of Sally Swift's book Centered Riding that has been around for years. Save your time and your money and go right to the original source. Sally Swift has videos and is a much better author or rider than Peggy Cummings could ever hope to be.
4,Good quality product,I went from store to store looking for a size handle that would fit my shower door. I should have just gone online and saved myself the hassle. It's a good quality product that should last a long time.
4,Does the job.,"These shower handles fit and installed perfectly and easy. Other than the back of the handle being hollow, which gives it a inexpensive feel, they do the job."
5,Take the Plunge,"Some fairly harrowing material rendered in graceful lines and stark detail. Humor is always lurking just around the corner, giving these poems a nice lift, and some good balance to the narrator's experience. A strong watchful voice throughout. There's also a nice progression from poem to poem--these are stops along the way. You'll want to read these poems one after the other, probably in a single sitting."
5,Smart Hands Free Cellphone Holder,Excellent product highly recommend the Smart Handsfree Cellular Phone Holder.
3,Karthago - 'Live At The Roxy' (Bellaphon),"Originally released in 1976, as I've heard of this German hard rock band before but this was the first CD of theirs I've ever heard. Nothing out-standing here but it's okay. Tunes I liked best were the well-played ""Sound In The Air"", the sixteen-minute rocking ""Highway Seeker"" and ""See You Tomorrow In The Sky"". There are also a couple of cuts here that had a touch of funk to them - ""Wild River"" and ""Going Down"". Line-up: Joey Albrecht & Reinhard Bopp-guitar & vocals, Gerald Hartwig-bass & vocals, {one-time Guru Guru member} Ingo Bischof-keyboards & vocals and Ringo Funk-drums. Should appeal to fans of Real Ax Band, 2066 And Then, Uriah Heep and possibly (this is a long-shot) Head East."
2,"Maybe ideal for an apartment, but not for a house","I received great service from Amazon, but this phone has the worst range of any 5.8 GHz I've seen. The previous reviewer is right. If you take it anywhere near 20 feet away from the base station, the phone will cut you off. The range is even worse if there are obstructions. If you're living in a two bedroom apartment, this might be a great purchase. However, if you plan to use this in even a small three bedroom home - reconsider."
3,Nice--but,"I've owned the single version of this phone for several months. If you get more than 20 yards away from the base, it cuts out and quality is nil. I do like the voice message waiting light. For one who is somewhat technology challenged--I don't like having to hit ""End"" to disconnect!"
1,Disappointment!!,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase!! The service I recieved from Amazon was great..but the phone absolutely sucks...I can't use it on my porch,like I planned..too much static..also it turns itself off around my air conditioner. I was so sure purchasing this product was going to great.it's supposed to be a good company!!"
1,This phone should be illegal to sell,"There is NO WAY this phone should get 2 stars... The static makes conversations impossible at any range. You simply cannot move around at all. Complete waste of money, we have had to revert to our $5 corded phone for anyone to understand a word we say. Absolutely USELESS phones."
2,"Serviceable, but not worth the money","The sound quality is fine if you are in range. The dual headsets work as advertised, in other words:1. You cannot talk on both phones at the same time (instead, you can transfer a call to the other phone).2. The range is not great (though I have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft)3. The voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none.Other than that, it's a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household."
1,"DON'T BUY, THIS PHONE IS A PILE.","I bought this phone, because it uses the 5.8GHz frequency range, and I needed something cheap for my 2nd work line. From the outside, it looked like it had everything I needed, and two handsets for about $40 was a good price.I was wrong. This has turned out to be a complete waste of my money. The phone has hardly any ringer and volume options, it has NO MUTE feature (for those of you on conf calls frequently), and the sound quality is sub-par. Uniden used zero creativity or engineering when they made this model... SAVE YOUR MONEY and get something else."
2,"Static, static, static",I am not a person that is hard to please when it comes to cordless phones. All that I ask is for good quality conversation. These phones fail that basic requirement. Everything else seems to work well - battery life is good - it is just difficult to carry on a conversation.
1,AWFUL!!!,"You'd think that because these phones have a higher GHz, that the sound would be of decent quality...NOT! These phones have bad static and when I am on the phone, I am questioned about where I am! Ridiculous! The Uniden 2.4 GHz is a wonderufl phone compared to this one, never had any problems of the 3 years I had them, however after then, they just went dead on me, I had the expandable ones (2.4) and only one just stopped working. So I would go with the 2.4 before I went with the 5.8. Awful quality and sound!!! Do not waste your money!"
1,Utter garbage,"I liked the price of this, but I guess you get what you pay for. My friends complained that I sounded as though I were underwater. I returned this product - a real piece of Cr*p."
1,deserves zero stars ...,"This phone stopped working just right after I threw all the packing material away. Horrible, horrible static. Non user friendly buttons as well. I wish I could have returned it. Do not buy this phone."
1,This phone sucks!,"I've owned Uniden products in the past and have been generally happy with them, but quality control really dropped the ball on this one. I bought this phone because it was reasonably priced and had the 5.8 GHz technology. I was gravely disappointed. I can't sit 2 feet away from the base without getting mind numbing static! My old rotary dial phone can do better than that! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!"
1,Go with Vtech Instead -- S-T-A-T-I-C,"I purchased this phone and a similar model from Vtech for our office -- the Vtech was only slightly more expensive, has NO static on the line, and was shipped w/in 24 hours by Amazon... whereas the Uniden had horrible static on the line (even if you try to search for a different channel), no speaker phone, and took 2 weeks to arrive.... b/c of the static, I ended up returning the Uniden. Forgot one more thing -- the Uniden doesn't have a blinking light indicator for voicemail like the Vtech."
1,I thought I had just gotten a lemon...,"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been regretting it ever since. What horrible quality. I'm looking around now to replace all of our phones (thinking Panasonic) and thought I'd check to see what this phone's reviews had been. It's next to worthless and I'm glad to see it wasn't just me, my phone service, bad karma, etc."
2,Too much static!,"The good things about this phone are the multiple handsets, the call-waiting caller id, and the use of the single base by both handsets requiring a single phone line.The main bad thing about this phone is the static! From the first day the phone was installed, every call has been plagued with static. This phone is definitely going to be replaced.I rated this phone 2-stars due to the good things I mentioned above."
2,HORRIBLE,"NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH ITS EFFICIENCY.IF YOU LIVE IN A SMALL HOUSE, IT MIGHT WORK WELL.IT CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH GHz FOR OUR HOUSE."
1,Junk!,"I've been through two of these now. Both of them stopped working within a couple of months. I only bought a second one because we liked having the hands-free phone and I figured maybe I got a dud. WRONG! They're all duds, and now I'm stuck with two of them. Don't buy this product!"
1,The unit I received was a dud.,One the second day of using the phone I started to hear buzzes and whistles on the line. Soon after that I intermittantly could not here the person to whom I was talking but they could hear me. Tried to send it back but...I could not. Guess I'm stuck with it.
3,Too Abstract and Simple.,"I'm an experienced tatter and just wanted a book of little motifs. This book is way too simple. It's more like freehand things if you want to do a picture. Not good if you want little motifs. If you want to add tatting to artwork, then this is perfect."
4,Pictorial Work in Tatting,This little volume will teach you how to make pictures suitable for cards and framed work. It contains some wonderful pictures of trees with tiny birds and animals and all sorts of small designs which can be used for cards and all sorts of things. I particularly like the snail with the chain curving round and round to form the shell!Clear instructions are provided at the beginning on using and reading the patterns which are in both diagrammatical and text format. The designs are unusual and many are interesting minimalist forms.The book is also a good introduction to freeform work and will provide some inspiration for that kind of lace without overpowering a relative beginner with complex techniques.
5,For women who are living out loud.,"This book reaffirms why I like strong and confident women. This book is not for you if you're one of those ""husband-catering cooking-baking"" type women who's life's goal is to marry up and drive an SUV. All the rest, you're in for a great ride."
5,Building Love,"The Keys to Growing in Love by Gary Smalley combines three books, The Language of Love, Love is a Decision and The Two Sides of Love. He presents a ""workable, biblically based plan of action for building loving, lasting relationships"".If you are looking for solid, faith-based help for your marriage, this may be the book(s) for you."
3,Interesting views...,Had lots to say about things we should all keep in mind when in a relationship or seeking one.
5,Love this book.,I read this book as a graduate student and loved it then. I still love it. It's a great story about how one can come to truly appreciate a culture very different from their own.
3,I heard the owl call my name,Good book. Made into movie but not DVD/VHS. Amazon ad said it was on VHS/DVD. Thought I was buying a CD. Little disappointed when received and was not notified by Amazon of the difference.
2,I Didn't HATE It,"This wasn't a horrible book, but it certainly is not a book that I will pick up again.The book was rather pointless. No trace of a plot exists between the pages of 'I Heard the Owl Call My Name'.This book contained a plethora of descriptions concerning the settings and it overshadowed any glimmer of a story-line or character development.Essentially, the book in its entirety is just a book of pointless descriptions of which can be completely over-looked and you'd still get the general idea of what it's about.A young vicar spends about two years living amongst natives of Kingcome. People die, children go to school, he rebuilds the vicarage, etc. Reading this book is equivalent to eavesdropping on a persons day-to-day life. Not all that interesting..."
2,"A great theme, a bad book","This book has an excellent theme dealing with a rapidly vanishing culture, cooperation, diversity, and a hint of rasistism. Although this book demonstrates wonderful pontiental, it stops on the doorstep of good. The story is hard to follow, far from a page turner, and unintresting"
5,"This Book is Better the ""Second Time Around""",After being reminded while reading another book that I had loved I HEARD THE OWL . . . I decided to reread it this weekend. It has had a profound effect on me; I don't want to come back to reality. Instead I want to be back in that beautiful place to which Margaret Craven's beautifully drawn images has just taken me.My first reading of this was many years ago after which I saw the movie on VHS and later listened to a reading of it on a cassette tape. All of this is to say how totally overwhelmed I was the first time I read it. I am an avid reader but have only rarely reread a book. I realize now that I will be drawn to reread I HEARD THE OWL CALL MY NAME frequently.If you have it read it.
1,The guy who has to write an essay on this,"im with all the ppl who say this is a terrible book. i wont go into boring, stupid details (that would make me like the book) but i hated it. had to read it for a 12th grade course and i hattted it! stay away if u can!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not worth the price,"I paid one penny for this. Even discounting the $3.99 shipping, that's over priced. All I can figure is the author knew the publisher. Terrible writing and full of unexplained twinkly fairy thinking."
3,A Haunting Tale,The story remains in my memory although it has been some time since I read it. My Grandmother was Cree so I have a particular interest in native American stories.
5,Wise and beautiful...,"Simplicity and depth in a short novel, and in the small community portrayed. As most reviewers seem to still be in school, I'll suggest that this is a fine book for adults, particularly those with interest in the North Pacific Coast, or Native American culture in general. While death, in several senses, figures prominently in this work, there is quiet joy as well, and evocative portrayals of the natural world."
4,A Great Rainy Day Book,This quick read is a rather enjoyable book that can be easily read in 1 or 2 sittings. I really enjoy reading it. I would have like to have seen more character development in regard to some of the members of the tribes but overall it was a great book. This book of self-discovery is great for students and adults. If you don't enjoy this book now put it on the shelf and read it again in a few years. Eventually it will be the perfect book for your situation.
3,A book of my youth,"This book was required reading in high school (8th grade I believe) and recently the book was mentioned in a local newspaper article which prompted me to reread it 40+ years later.It certainly is not a great book foran adult as it's simply written and the author does little to develop the characters. I think it's a wonderful book for a yong teenager to move forward from the books of their youth.The book does drive home how we the ""white man"" did change the way of the native indian culture and the evils of alcohol are a factor.Buy this book for your son/daughter or grandson/granddaughter but don't buy it for adult reading."
2,The Owl Didn't Call my Name,"The book I heard the Owl Call My Name was one of the worst books I have read in a while. I wouldn't of even wasted my time in reading it, except it was for a class. The subject matter was poor, the language was poor, and the development of the plot was poor. The book had a lot of potential to be good, but the writer did a poor job developing it. I think that it might have been better for me if I had interest in Native Americans or could relate to them. But I can't. If you love Indian culture you might find this book interesting. But for me it was boring."
1,Not as great a book as everyone says it is.,"This is THE most tasteless book I have read in my entirelifetime. I used to think that there was no such thing as a book thatwas BAD through and through, but I Heard the Owl...proved me wrong. No characters that had an ounce of realism in them, no sensitivity, nada. Yeah, I know the Kwaciutl tribe doesn`t show emotion and that the death of a child wouldn`t cause them to burst into tears, but please. This book comes across as more of a boring text book teaching us about Indian culture than a novel about teaching us about life, death, and love (and speaking of love, don`t expect to find an ounce of it in the story.)"
4,Brief info of tourettes,And thats what I liked sbout this book. I am borderline ocd/tourettes and this book had few pages about tourettes that really put some things into perspective for me. I recommend this book
2,Look elsewhere for help,"This book is not a self-help book, but purports to explain the disorder and give some info about treatments. There are better books out there that give info on OCD and give a self-help program, info on medications, and info on therapy. (Try books by Fred Penzel or Jonathan Grayson.)I was particularly bothered by 2 things: 1. The author refers to obsessions as ""bad thoughts"" throughout the book. OCD is a medical condition and obsessions are symptoms - the ""bad thoughts"" term has connotations that in effect are a judgement on the sufferer (as if OCD people need more guilt. 2. The author presents the disease as confined to obsessions that are violent or disturbing (hence the ""bad thoughts"" label), ignoring or glossing over those relating to excessive responsiblity, etc. So a complete picture is not given. There are better resources out there. Pass this one up."
1,"This book is just plain ""bad""","After reading Dr. Baer's previous book on OCD I had high hopes that The Imp would shed some new light on the treatment of obsessive thoughts that are unwanted, intrusive, and inappropriate. His use of ""bad"" in the title should have prompted me to pass on this recycled... I can only surmise that my obsessive thinking got in the way of making a good decision.Reason for this post: for those who suffer from truly bad obsessive thinking with or without compulsions, go to Amazon's book section and click into your basket just about any book by a real researcher, such as Steketee, Foa, Hyman, Wilson, Jenike. As for The Imp, recycle it in the usual way..."
1,A waste of time,The author is so repetitive that the book probably could have been 10 pages or less. It is not worth the read.
5,Very Helpful Book,Book was very helpful and I would recommend it to anyone who has OCD. It has lots of helpful information in it and the exercises were really helpful.
4,derby hat review,"The hat is good, the material is nice, and the work is fine. The hat is made in China (but its fine). i measured my head (59 cm) and choosed the right side from the size table, but the hat is a bit larger. better try a hat on your head before buying. the shipment was fine."
4,Toy Story 2,I rented this game on 64 of corse its another system but its still the same.I had 5 day rentel I beat it on the last day.Your Buzz Lightyear saving Woddy and you have to collect tokens and you need so many to play the last level.The game gets really cool cause you go back to levels about 5 upgrades and the whole time in the game people are challenging you. THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR YOUNG ONES.
4,Good game but not for all ages.,"Toy Story 2 is a good game with very good graphics.It's almost like playing the movie that's how good it looks.But be warned this game is for kids between (ages of 3 and 8). It's a bit difficult at first but once your kid plays it more then once, they'll get the hang of it and have fun.If you are looking for a kiddie game than this is the game for you."
3,Like the movie.,"This game is hard. Not that hard, but with puzzles. You need to find tokens to get to the bext level. The tokens are hidden, like get 50 coins, five sheep, etc. Bosses are easy, and the levels are very boring. Buzz runs very slow, and sometimes you need to run a lot so its boring. There are levels that there weren't in the movie. Like construction yard, Allies and Gullies, etc. And when I got all 50 tokens, I thought there would be an extra level, but no."
1,WHERE IS THE GAME?,"How can we review a game that was never received? Amazon said it was in stock, but it never arrived. We received a note that said the item was no longer available, and they would refund our money. I am so tired of this kind of thing happening, especially when I'm ordering games for my two teen-aged boys. Online sellers should be able to immediately tell you if your item is in stock or not. Telling me it's not in stock by mail, on the day it's supposed to arrive, is bad business."
4,TXR fans,"this game is only a really good game if you have played the TXR racing series and like them. This game is very similar and is def just as addicting as the first ones. There are a few downfalls though. There are only like 10 cars, so you will be racing 300 cars that are the same cars throughout. Also the graphics dont appear to be 360 graphics except for your which you can modify a decent amount. One really good upgrade besides the addition of a few minor highways, is th parking area. The PA is where you will find racers parked and ready to race. Just as the last TXR games, there are many wanderers and still is a pain in the a$$ to figure out there requirements. I suggest trying to find a strategy guide if you plan on racing the Datsun that appears after all racers are beat.If your a TXR fan and looking for a cheap and fun game then I recommend this game. Its pretty fun racing your way to the top of tokyos highways."
1,import tuner challenge,The people that rated this game over a 1 must have one to sell.This game was a joke. If they had a 0 rating that's what I would give it. I bought it last month for 20.00 and I felt like I got ripped off. I did however get 35.00 trade-in at blockbuster. I would advice anyone who purchased this to do the same because the price will definately drop SOON.This game looked worst than the Tokyo drifter series on ps2. I would not recommend this game for anyone. Tom B
3,Shutokou Battle X; Import Tuner Challenge,"Pretty good, but could do wihtout the silly bluring (speed distortion?).Also a bit of a bummer not having the rest of the Wangan, Yokohane line, Yokohama Kanjou, or the Hanshin or Nagoya-city freeways."
3,They take longer to dry than I would like.,"These are great, except that they take a bit longer to dry than I would like. They are, however, very supportive, which is what is lacking in most other water shoes. These grip well on rough surfaces, but can be a little dubious on tile. Overall, quite good -- but not as good as I had hoped. I would still recommend them, though."
5,The saga continues!,"It has been interesting to witness the author hone his skills and develope his identity through his continued efforts. ""Guilt Trip"" is by fall the best yet, he has managed to bring his stroy to life through the story-lines. I drive Highway 281 often and he captures the true sense of the people and places in this beautiful part of Texas. The author does a good job of misdirection and clue compounding in the vastly entertaining story. He has added depth to the main characters and introduced several new and colorful characters to keep the story line interesting. I can hardly wait for the next book to see how Marlin does with his new flame..."
2,Dullest First Half of a Book I've read in years,"There are a lot of books about the Blanco County Game Warden who is the hero of this book so someone must like them. The first half was just terrible. I only kept reading because I try to finish all books, no matter how dull. In the second half of the book the focus shifts from the game warden and his even duller rural county law enforcement buddies and looks at the bad guys. That part is interesting, there just isn't enough of it to save the book. It is way too late for that. Also the big tough game warden turns into Beaver Cleaver at the 8th grade dance when faced with the pretty, competent, smart, insightful, brave, strong, female deputy. I guess the author had his eye on a screenplay and wanted to make sure there was a strong, central female character. He just went a little overboard. Like every single ""thriller"" written in the last ten years the cover blurbs say it's funny and fun. Believe me it is neither."
3,Guilt Trip,Good read with fear and anticipation. Don't want to give away the plot and the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the language was explicit but that is just my preferences. Enjoyed it on my new Kindle also purchased at Amazon and I am very satisfied!
4,I love these folks!,I love the quirky folks who live in Blanco County! This book is very good but not quite as hilarious as the others.
3,Hill Country Citizen,My husband and I have been coming to the Hill Country for many years; we moved here permanently in 2006. It is heaven on earth!! Reading this book was almost like traveling along with the characters because we are familiar with every place it took us to.Enjoyed it very much!!!!!
5,4.5 Stars,"Rehder took some of his great wit out of this book. While it is excellent, it is a bit more serious and not quite as much fun as his previous books. The characters are fantastic, let them be funnier (and screwier) in the next book."
5,Great trip,Can't put it down. Love this series. I can tell you these characters and Texas towns in central Texas are spot on!
5,Guilt Trip,Another good read! Have enjoyed every single book I have found to read. Love his characters and his sense of humor!
5,Excellent information & advice!,"This book was suggested to our Sewing Guild during a recent class on fitting. Many of us struggle with finding our own style based on the shape of our bodies. This book gives excellent advice on clothing styles, accessories, shoes, and even makeup suggestions - ""don't overdo it""! Classic white shirts, great-fitting jeans, and coats. And, it provides you with brand suggestions as well as where you can get them. Ready-to-wear doesn't fit most of us so they suggest finding a great tailor to help with the fit. Thank goodness WE can do that now! I purchased 6 copies of the book for some of our Guild members and I have someone else requesting 2 more copies. I highly recommend this book as an excellent guide to finding and creating your own style."
4,Learn how to dress your figure,"I found this book helpful especially her explanation of body types both in regular and plus sizes. The author's information gave me the knowledge I needed to buy clothing that enhances my good features and helps to hide the flaws. I really appreciated the advice she gave about certain designers and stores which carry clothes that fit my body type the best. I have purchased several pieces using her guidelines and I am pleased with the results. I have even found jeans that fit my plus size figure.There was more information in the book than I was looking for ie make-up, hairstyles,etc. She also highly recommends a tailor to restyle clothes to a perfect fit. I do not think the average woman would be able to afford such a luxury, even alterations can be expensive.I did glean enough information though to make it well worth my while,and I have received several compliments since making the changes."
4,Should be Read (and re-read) Throughly,"I just bought this book yesterday, mostly based on the reviews I read here. What I find odd are the previous reviews that complain about the author's so-called emphasis on high end brands. More than once Ms. Farr says to use designer brands as research and a reference. e.g the bottom of page 84 to 85.On page 86 she says. ""Paying attention to...the details...means you are better equipped to find...pieces in your price range and size range.""I love this book. I couldn't put it down all evening. It takes a realistic and systematic approach to looking your best. I love how she peppers the book with little tricks like how to determine how short your skirt can be before going over to the tarty side.I would would recommend this book to anyone who wants to thin out and upgrade their wardrobe. No one book can give you everything you need but ""The Pocket Stylist"" provides a rock solid foundation. This book will probably become an anchor in my style library."
5,It really is like having your own personal stylist!,"I love this book. Kendall Farr's advice is easy to follow and completely empowering. For anyone who feels overwhelmed or bewildered by clothes shopping, read this book and you will have clarity like you never thought possible. Farr's advice is fun to read, easy to follow, achievable for anyone at any budget. It really is like having your own personal stylist."
3,"Get a tailor. There you go, I just saved you some money on the book.","If I could sum up this book, it is that you're supposed to get a tailor to have everything fit you properly and not to go after trends for your staple pieces, just your accessories. There you go, I just saved you the time and money on the book.Meh."
2,The Pocket Stylist,I do not think there is information in the book that is useful. I usually find at least one tip or idea that I find interesting this timeI just gave this group of books away
3,somewhat useful,"Too much fashion jargon and could be easier to navigate through, this book would benefit greatly from a glossary and index. Nice illustrations. My copy had some pages repeated, but nothing was missing. I liked the specific suggestions on where to shop, what's indispensable in a woman's wardrobe, and what to toss."
3,Help with the basics for the fashionista wannabe,"If you already have a sense of Self, your own style, and know how to look in a mirror when you get dressed, you won't need this guide, and it won't help you develop a quirky, stand-out-from-the-crowd style, which can really come only from within. The authors point to icons like Audrey Hepburn or Marilyn Monroe, who had a lot more going for them than just good fashion (such as great charisma, being photogenic, buckets of money, and the advice of top stylists). But if you're a trend-follower, the book will help you look more pulled together even without your own unique look; a better subtitle might have been ""Advice on Classic Dressing for Your Body Type."""
4,Good resource,"This is a very good book about developing your own style. A lot of women would benefit from reading it. It's contemporary and relevant, well-written and practical."
5,Great book!,"Sensible, down to earth, practical. Fun, tongue in cheek, self-revealing.This little book does what 10 of the usual books labor over and does it painlessly. It is a little ambitious in places (must I have everything tailored?)but breaks down the process of being well dressed into manageable chunks.It is NOT about name-dropping and celebrity gossip. If you want teenage type twittering skip this. This book is about trying to get the best look possible within the limitations of a everyday life. Everyone, okay, everygirl I've shown this to asked where they could get a copy. And it makes a good companion to the fashionista books, as it will help you decide whether to follow a trend or run away as fast as your heels will allow."
2,Disappointment,"I read all the other reviews before ordering this book and compared them with reviews on several books on this topic. I am disappointed with this book. There is nothing new here. A Vogue Magazine would have been better worth my time and money. Also, the sentence structure and punctuation are so poor that many sentences had to be reread several times to understand, and some sentences were just a string of Nouns with a period at the end."
4,Common sense at at last!,"Like many of my girlfriends, I have always found the world of fashion to be a rather exclusive club to which I've somehow be denied membership. Thank you so much Kendall Farr for being a kind, wise and very funny friend! Reading Ms Farr's book is like be taken by the hand by a generous insider and led gently but confidently into a new world where I can at last have a comfortable bra, pants that fit, clothes that flatter and I don't have to feel like a loser for hating thong underwear! Style CAN be for every woman. If you want to look and feel better in your clothes, read this book!"
5,A request for Ms. Farr,"I agree with most of the other reviewers that Kendall Farr's The Pocket Stylist is a well-written and helpful primer for those of us in need of some wardrobe guidelines. The reason for my review, however, in case Ms. Farr ever checks these reviews, is to ask her to write another book. Please, please write a styling book for men/husbands! I am always at odds with my husband over what looks good on him. For example, though he has a paunchy stomach and very full thighs, he always goes straight to the racks of pleated pants and I have to fight tooth and nail with him to buy flat-front versions. I'd love to have guidelines based on his body type to follow, just as I will follow Ms. Farr's examples of what a type B woman should wear. Thanks for reading my review!"
4,"Easy to follow , straight forward advice","The Pocket Stylist is a very easy to follow book that offers tips on what looks best on 3 different body types (A,B,C) with separate tips for larger women (D,E,F). The guide is helpful in that these are style tips for LIFE, not just this season. Handy if you are interested in building a wardrobe with some expensive things! The second half of the book gives more general style tips on appearance - hair, nails, makeup. I think the book does a good job of outlining clothing options for each type of woman. I would have liked to have seen more than 3 drawn clothing pictures for my type. Photos of SEVERAL outfits would definetly help you visualize better the look you are trying to achieve. However, I photocopied my ""type"" advice for use on my next shopping trip!"
3,Desperately needs illustrations,"This book is sorely lacking in illustrations. It assumes the reader is familiar with fashion terminology. If I knew that much about fashion, I wouldn't need the book. The book goes through each of the six body types and tells you what to wear for each type - but there are no pictures except some unlabelled cartoons at the end of each section. Maybe it's just me, but I don't know what a ""Surplice top"" looks like, or a ""Blouson"", or a ""Peplum jacket"". I don't doubt that the author is quite expert, but the book fails to convey her expertise to the uninitiated. Pictures, pictures, pictures!!!!I gave it 3 stars rather than 2 because I found the general principles useful, and because I expect I'll be able to google all the unexplained terms and find pictures on the internet. I supposed the idiot editors that let this through were trying to save money - illustrations are expensive."
2,Useful but not very pretty,This book had a lot of information but that might be the problem. This book has too much writing and not enough pictures. The fashionably challenged women who are reading this book are not going to know half of the words the author uses to describe the fashions she's telling you to not to wear. Not helpful. If there were more pictures involved it would be really helpful to people who have no idea what is going on fashion-wise.I did love how this was broken up into body types but the rest of the book was a waste once you read your section. I liked the specific rules for each body type and it really helped me understand what works and what doesn't.
2,There are much better style books out there,This book actually has some useful advice but it gets lost under the irritation raised by the author's tendency to talk down to her audience. The detailed descriptions on other body types than your own are waste of page space so there are less pages to read than the 196. There are no pictures of the clothes or styles so you just have to imagine what the writer is describing.
3,What about us boyish rectangular shaped women?,"I was so looking forward to this book, but I ended up disappointed. There was good information to be had in spite of my body type not being defined or even mentioned once. I ended up taking tips from body type A and C as those seemed to most address my porpotions. I am tall, thin, with a narrow frame and small-breasted."
1,UNREADABLE,"I can't understand 90% of this book. It is written in the vocabulary of those in the fashion industry and, possibly, die hard fashonistas... and I can't imagine any of them would need such a book. Also, very few pictures at all, and none are photographs. If you don't know the fashion industry vocabulary, it's impossible to know what she's trying to convey with so few visuals. A glossary, as some have pointed out, would be extremely useful. Personally, I didn't buy this book in order to spend hours and hours looking up the terms she's using online. My last criticism is, as so many have pointed out, her categories for body types are horribly narrow, excluding a huge number of women (I personally did fit into one type nicely, but I could easily rattle off the names of at least a dozen gorgeous women I know who don't). I'm glad that I bought this used for only a few dollars vs. full price, and yet I'm convinced that what I did pay was still too much by far."
5,This is more than worth the price,"For any great fan of Xena, this is a great buy. It details further findings of the beloved Melinda Pappas and Janice Covington in their quest to learn about Xena in the Xena Scrolls discovered during World War II. Great fun for a fan."
2,Try Street Atlas of Cuyahoga County,Universal Maps has a better product called Cuyahoga County Street Atlas. This map didn't work for me.
3,Nice color,"I really like the color but its way to creamy for me. I would like absorve in my lips, I like matte lipsticks better."
4,Laptop Battery,"Product is great, as was the price. It took a little longer to receive the battery than I thought it should - meaning I didn't have it in time for an overseas trip."
1,Hello...? Is This Thing On??,"Yet Another product presented without so much as 1 tune to hear.How are companies supposed to ask what is it like, $17 PLUS shippingjust to Listen to the cd in Hopes you'll like it? That's Worse thanpaying money for shipping to try on clothes & then they don't work, b/cyou're at Least seeing a photo of the garment.No. Make the Effort. Post your samples.I hope we've learned something here."
3,"Good, But...","This is a good selection of tunes, but not as good as Elemental Chill 2. When I say ""good"", it is - of course - a matter of musical taste.., something forgotten by today's so-called critics. Note: I thought the musical WICKED was awful. Specifically, the NY cast (even the guys sounding like Bell from Beauty and the Beast) couldn't carry a note in a hand basket. Yet the show received great reviews. More than a matter of taste...If you enjoy contemporary jazz, suggest you select Elemental Chill 2 over Chill 1. And, if you like Broadway musicals rent South Pacific or Oklahoma."
4,pretty darn nice,Pretty darn good mints. They also have the best name so my students in high school always are trying to take them from me. This variety pack is the best thing if you have never tried any of their flavors. good buy indeed.
4,good mints,they are high quality mints that are different from the rest with a good variety but a lil expensive is all.
3,"Great tins, not so great mints","I bought this over a year ago from the Oral Fixation website (paying quite a bit more). The tins are very nice if, like me, you can not seem to get enough of these neat little tins.The mints themselves are not good. The chai(Nightlight)caffeinated mint is pretty good, which is funny since I love the smell of Chai tea but despise the taste. Cinnamon is bearable but can not compare to an Altoid Cinnamon. The others are just horrible. The all have a strange chemical taste to them."
2,Very Overpriced Mints,"I am going to be very honest.....the only reason I purchased these mints is because I just received my first credit card and was going online shopping crazy. Amazon used to advertise how we would get free shipping for orders over $25 and I guess i bought into it lol. These mints come in a nice case, but other than that they are pretty ordinary."
3,Tins are great... mints are not,I use the tins as wallets so that is why I purchased... the mints themselves aren't so good. Leave a bad taste in your mouth.
3,not as good as i remember,"Packaging of them- the tins they come in- are very high quality- they look cool too. As for flavor...first let it be known that these are NOT Altoids or anything like that, they are not strong and they are not meant to be strong, neither are they breath mints (although the site calls them that). Now, the reason my review is only 3 stars is because the first time i had these mints they were awesome- really smooth texture and unique flavor (i got some free samples) but the ones i bought here do NOT taste the same (they are the same brand and flavor...there is no mistaking it)so maybe i got a funky batch? i dunno....these just arent the same as the samples i tried"
4,"diabetic friendly, EXCEPT for one of the tins in the set","The logo design and brand name are fun, the box is slim, durable, and easily transported, The mints come in exotic, intense flavors without an aftertaste. BEWARE, however that one of the tins in the set is not sugar free.It is hard to read the labels on the tins."
2,Flimsy plastic top,"The bottom part of this sign is outstanding; cast iron. But the top is made of a flimsy plastic and when I put the first sign in it, it fell apart. We have to tape the base of the top so it won't fall apart. Not worth the price."
1,Not worth the money,"It was fun, but only 6 games and non of them are for anyone over 12. Good price when I got it for $10 shipped though!"
5,Very very good. A total blast.,"Geometry wars, Kaloki X, Wik: Fable of souls, they're all awesome. This is a great value for some casual gaming. I'd buy it again any day. And for >$10, it's a steal. Worth every penny."
3,This game was a GREAT buy!,"At the time I purchased the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged, it was only $7.99. It turned out to be an even better buy then I had planned on! I highly recommend picking this up."
2,"game nt what I expected, still have to buy most games on this disc","was excited when I bought the game because it gave us a few more options, was sad when I turned it on to play and find out most games you still need to purchase, kind of a rip off from x box actually but games we can play are ok"
3,Good for the price but overall the game could of been better,"It was really cheapand for its price that I got it, it was worth it."
5,"Duh, this is a frickin' deal!","I paid less than 4 dollars for this and the free month of X-box live alone is worth 10... The games are fine, you'll like at least 2 of the 6, but that's not important when you consider this a month of Live Gold. Buy it if you like playing on line and it pays you!"
4,"WOW, I NEVER EXPECTED IT TO BE THIS GOOD 8.5 OUT OF 10","Mini-game collections are a strange bunch. For every Wario Ware Inc. you get crap like the critically ashamed Fuzion Frenzy 2. Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged luckily finds itself in the Wario Ware Inc. crowd. This collection has some pretty neat games like my favorites: Bejeweled 2 and Geometry Wars. The are a few other interesting ones as well like Marble Mania and few others that are fun to play. There are maybe one or two weak links in this awesome package, and some of the games need to be fully downloaded on Xbox Live. But this game is successful in doing what it's supposed to do, give people simple, fun games. This game also makes me remember the good times with games like Wario Ware Inc. and early Mario Party games and why they were so fun in the first place."
3,Cool Arcade Mix,"This are decent Arcade games they put in, Wik is difficult and fun, we all know bejewel, Geometry wars super-difficult, ect.. , this are the kind of games that you play when you'r tire of graphics or shooting ( COD, GOW ), sit , relax, and enjoy!"
4,One of 2002's best,"With it's jittery energy, abstract lyrics, and menacing basslines, Ikara Colt sounds a lot like Pink Flag era Wire (definitely not a bad thing at all). Though a thoroughly original sound may be lacking, a stack of great art-punk tunes most certainly is not. At The Lodge is the standout. One of 2002's best albums."
4,It finally answers all your questions,After reading all the Cussler books I was always trying to remember which book related to which girls/baddies etc. I found that Al had his finger blown off in Pacific Vortex when I thought he lost it in the Mediterranean Caper. A really good encylopadia on Dirk Pitt and the crew
3,For the true Clice Cussler fan,"An ""encyclopedia"" reference to all of Clive Cussler's writings. Great opening chapter. If you are a Clive Cussler fan this book is for you. The complete reference guide to the Dirk Pitt series."
3,Dirk Pitt Revealed,Interesting information and recap of charactors in the Dirk Pitt series. But I found myself quicking flipping through the pages and skipping some other sections.
4,escape from new york one of carpenter's finest,"I really love this reissue, I have the Dagored vinyl reissue released in 2000. First this is a must for musicians that collect vintage synths and drum machines, I recognize some of the sounds from early 80's synths I have. Carpenter has taken soundtrack music to a new level and the fruits are represented on this record better than any other I feel. If you can find this issue of the vinyl it comes highly recommended. I think the record sounds much better than the reissue CD. Not to mention it comes with a full color movie poster of the Italian cut of the film ""1997:Fuga Da New York"". I think that in the near future people like John Carpenter and the Italian band Goblin will get their due as trailblazers of electronic music and soundtracks. ""You Are The Duke!"" Donald Pleasence"
4,Typical of Its Genre,"If you're a fan of soundtracks driven by haunting tunes from electronic synthesizers, this one belongs in your CD collection. Very reminiscent of early Tangerine Dream soundtrack cuts (like the sexy train sequence in ""Risky Business"") that were typical from 1980 to 1986. Afficiados refer to this period as the ""Virgin Years"" and it is a by-gone era. You rarely hear this kind of music anymore -- although bits and pieces have been picked up and integrated into a newer musical form called ""Trance."" Composed by John Carpenter, my favorite on this CD is the Main Theme, followed by the entrance by the Duke.Greg CatonLake Charles, LAcaton@ifu.netJuly 20, 1999"
1,A rip off,"As a psychologist, I purchased this book expecting a thorough presentation of the topic and for the price of $153.98, I expected a text book. Instead I received a 225 page paper back which barely touches on the topics listed in the table of contents.I purchased at the same time, Paul Ekman's Telling Lies, Clues to Deceipt in the Marketplace, Politics, and Marriage. This book contained 385 pages and extensively delves into each topic. Not only is it better written, but the cost of this book was $10.49. To pay 14.7 times the price of this book for the Aldert Virj book was a rip-off. The seller still has not replied to my request to return this book.Richard S. Carter, Ph.D."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,I was really looking forward to this book but it just didn't deliver. It was too technical and boring. I'm a mental health professional and this book was just a bunch of fillers. I wish they made it more interesting. Too bad.
3,Okay.,"I am a big fan of lucas arts games and I really enjoyed this one. Now although all of the enemies are'nt authentic star wars characters, it is still an okay game. The levels are very varied and you have to do many different things. (land, land speeder, etc.) after awhile the game play gets a bit slow and the gameplay is frustrating, but it still makes a good game for the game gear."
2,Cheap,"This thing is built very cheaply and is fragile. The fan has a tendency to want to make a lot of noise and I only bought it a few days ago. Lots of very careful positioning seems to keep the noise away _for now_. In the meantime, I'll buy a different fan from somebody else."
2,Non-GMO?,Disappointed that this is advertised as Non-GMO in the description but no where on the label does it say that it is.
1,Beware! This version is genetically modified!,"This one with UPC ending with 2258 [733739022585] is made from GE soybeans.If you want to protect yourself from that danger, get the other one with UPC 2263 [733739022639]Now Foods Lecithin Gran Non-ge, 10-Pound"
5,Delicious,"I got this product for health reasons and found that it is amazingly delicious on salads. It gives salads a taste of hard boiled eggs, though I am not sure why, but who cares. Not sure if it is vegan, but worth the price."
5,as described,"Make sure you select the non-GMO. Once you start changing the size options, you're not getting the non-GMO anymore. Had to learn this the hard way when at first I ordered and selected the non-GMO then the second time ordering I neglected to make sure it expressly said non-GMO."
2,label on screen says 97% lecithin -- that's not what arrives,"I have tried buying different sizes of NOW lecithin ""97% phosphatides"" granules, and I have tried different vendors. But although the container label displayed on various online displays assert ""97% phosphatides"", I have yet to receive a container with such a label. Calculating the percentage can be tricky. I have experimented with the numbers on the label and cannot arrive at 97%.A lesser complaint: I have bought various brands of lecithin granules for years. ""Granules"" seem like ""granules"" for other vendors, but the NOW ""granules"" (some labels say ""fine granules"") are more like powder than anything else. If you sprinkle it on cereal, however, it doesn't really matter.The appealing feature of NOW ""97%"" lecithin "" is the competitive price. But if one is hoping for a high percentage of phosphatides to benefit cholesterol levels, then it might be worthwhile to order a product that arrives with the same label you saw when you ordered it."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM,"I purchased lecithin granules in a tin can and they chose to send it in an envelope (instead of a box) which was promptly destroyed in the mail (as one would expect). Then, they decided they would help me out to the point of refunding me, BUT NOT REFUNDING THE POSTAGE. I think that is an irresponsible way to do business- why should I have to pay for their mistake? Anyway, they refused to respond to further emails on this matter. I absolutely think that you should look elsewhere for your products.Especially since this business is supplying products that are supposed to be for one's health, you would think that it might be a little more conscientious as to how it treats its customers."
3,Worth a try,"This is basically a powder that consists of large yellow granules and can be mixed with anything from water to salad dressing. If you have some kind of reason to want to try this based upon your own interenet research or whatever, why not give it a shot? Not amazing not terrible tasting. I think this will be unlikely to provide you with any kind of spectacular results no matter what your reason for taking it."
3,"Now Foods Lecithin Granules, 2 pounds","In my opinion, there has been a decrease in the quality of the Now Food Lethicin Granules, 2 lb. Previous to about a year ago this product seemed fresher and was mostly granules. During this last year or so, this product seems less fresh at first opening, and is now about 70-30 powder to granules. I will continue purchasing this until I find something better. But I am looking around for a replacement product(organic if possible)."
2,Worst Raclette grill ever,I purchased this grill because it was cheap and I only planned to use it a hand full of time. However using it the first time the handles of the pans started melting. Terrible quality.
5,C'est fantastique,"Great for all French students. I enjoy having gotten it for this price, generally it is very pricey. I didn't like that it looks like I stole it from a library, but it has helped me understand French conjugation, more than I thought possible."
4,Good apparatus for the price,"I bought this item about 1 1/2 month ago and used it already 4 times. It is not expensive, it works well. The difficulty is to find a good raclette cheese to use with. I brought some from France and now I will try to find some on Internet."
2,Does not hold up,"After only two uses, the non-stick coating is already starting to come off! We did nothing out of the ordinary to make this happen either. The machine was nice to use the two times we did use it, but we are very disappointed about the lack of quality of the non-stick coating."
5,Perfect!,I have been using this Raclette set for 1 year and we never had any pb. it heats fast and well. Everybody aournd us loves it.
4,"Great appliance, minor concerns","My girlfriend and I bought this as a gift for our families to encourage sitting at the table and sharing a meal. It turned out great however, be advised that although the product is advertised to serve up to 6 people, you'll find it cumbersome to have enough cooking to feed them all. I'd say that this product is quite small and best fits the needs for 3 to 4 people. One more thing that I was asking myself why the designers wouldn't take into account is the need for a knob to regulate the intensity of the resistance like a stove would have... I hope this doesn't sound bad but the overkill or cold settings (on, off) are somewhat primitive. Granted you can turn it on or off as needed but that's inconvenient. Nonetheless, this little bad boy got the job done and actually kept us in the table for around 3 hours. The cleaning was effortless."
5,Absoultely beautiful!,These are exquisite! They sparkle and are a nice weight. You can't go wrong getting these for such a great price.
5,Totally Awesome,This book is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! I reccommend it Christians and non-Christians alike. It is very good and you will learn a lot about the Amish.
2,Not what I expected,I agree with reviews of this grinder from other websites. Its a very nice grinder and feels good in your hands but it takes many many turns to get much pepper out. It seems it does not matter if the setting is fine or coarse it just takes to many turns to get much pepper out.
2,cathy,"I loved this pepper mill when I first got it; however, after about 6 months of use I could no longer switch the grinding mechanism. It now takes so much effort to get the smallest amount of pepper and will only grind the pepper ultra fine."
1,I Hate This Thing,"Have had this for over 2 years now, and it's been a constant battle.The screw at the top that holds the cap on also can cause the grind to vary when it comes loose, which it often does when grinding.The Peugeot grinding mechanism is fine, the problem is the way the mechanism is held in position because of its inherent design. Tightening the top screw simply pulls the machine up and results in a very fine grind even when set at the max size.A simple cure would be a positive shoulder for the shaft to pull up against, giving a secure and consistent positioning of the two grinding surfaces relative to each other. As it is, they vary all over the place, and it's been like this since day one. Should have returned it.It gives an inconsistent grind, and the volume output is pathetic.Not only would I not recommend this thing.....if anyone loves 'em, I'll sell you mine.(purchased from high-end cooking store)"
1,terrible,"I bought this pepper mill based on great reviews on this site. What a mistake! I have only had it for 6 months and I am on today looking for a replacement. It looks great, but I have to bang and shake it to get much pepper out at all on any setting. Maybe I got a lemon but I cook a lot and I can't imagine a worse pepper mill. I wouldn't give it away."
1,Not worth half a star!,"One of the worst 'classical' music recordings I've ever heard, very low signal to noise ratio and there are audience fidgetings (loud coughing and chair creaking) through out the discs. The description here, ' Melodram (Ita) - #10027 / December 15, 1998', might lead you to think it was recorded in 1998 but it was actually recorded in 1960 and clearly not 'ADD'. Another disappointment, although admittedly less important, was the flimsy product packaging. It would have been a great improvement to wrap the discs in discarded newspaper and toss them in a plastic sack from the local fish market."
5,Love this stroller!,"I purchased this stroller four weeks ago for my baby and absolutely love it. It maneuvers well on different terrains. I live in the city and walk with it everywhere and it is great. I love the carseat adaptor that comes with the stroller as it hooks onto the stroller frame with ease making traveling with baby easier and the carseat fits snuggly and securely onto the frame. The only drawbacks are just in my opinoin that it lacks the carrycot/bassinet, which I would love to have for my newborn, especially that we live in a cold weather city and the raincover, which is a necessity in the pacific northwest. The reason they are drawbacks is that you can't buy either in the US and they only come from the UK, which is extremely expensive to purchase if you can find it. If BRU would carry these accessories, it would make things so much easier, but it doesn't affect the use of the stroller, which I highly recommend."
1,Flimsy folders,"I rarely return anything. These went straight back. I'm all for recycled files, but these are utterly flimsy and pointless. You may as well file your papers in a paper bag. Staples carries a stiffer brown recycled file which has become my standby. Save your $$ and your S&H."
5,Adds Great Flavor to Dishes,"I usually buy this brand at my local store. By chance, I found that you can buy these cheaper here at Amazon. Since I use dried porcini mushrooms a lot for soups, Crockpot dishes, pasta dishes, and more, I was pleased to find that I can buy 12 packages and save a lot. Yes, you do have to soak them for a few minutes and strain the soaking liquid, but most all dried mushrooms have the same directions, I've found. This is just to ensure that you don't get bits of grit in your finished product since commercial mushrooms are grown in sterile compost material. I still use the soaking liquid (after staining it) because the liquid itself adds a lot of flavor to the dish."
3,Wish I had known these had to be washed before using...,I purchased these mushrooms with the intent of grinding them up to use in rice mixes for gifts. I was not aware that they must be washed before using making them useless in this application. I have no plans to use them and cannot return them -- what a waste!
1,"old shows, and there's only 3!","This really is upsetting. The first dvd had several shows, I think maybe 5 of them. This one has only 3!! And, some of them are old ones, not the newer shows. My son and I were both disappointed. The silly ""game"" and the short little blooper spot do not make up for the stingy amount of actual tv shows. So sad. We're still big Suite Life fans, but I don't know if we'll buy another dvd."
1,Doesn't help,This is not at all a helpful solution to actually finding an agent. You're better off just surfing the web.
2,rehashing old material.......................again,"the only saving grace to this ""new"" issue is that it includes Imagine from the tribute to Sir Lew Grade, and the additon of Slippin and Slidin.i was hoping for the nice video from Stand By Me, but that was edited from its original content, and other materials added. Most of the other material has been seen in videos before.If you're a collector, you have to have it. If you were hoping for a infuse of new material, it's not here."
5,AWESOME,"THIS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY JOHN LENNON FAN. THE MUSIC IS HIS BEST WORK EVER (OF COURSE ALL OF HIS WORK IS A MASTERPIECE), AND YOU CAN LITTERALLY FEEL THE SPIRITUAL CONNECTION AND THE CHEMESTRY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN HE AND YOKO. SHE IS THE INSPIRATION FOR NEARLY ALL OF THE SONGS ON THE ALBUM. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE SO LUCKY TO HAVE A LOVE LIKE THAT, JUST ONCE IN THEIR LIFE. AFTER WATCHING IT, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ANGRY ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP, SHOULD FINALLY ""GET IT"" (A CLUE THAT IS).I MISS YOU JOHN LENNON!! THE WHOLE WORLD MISSES YOU!P.S. FANS WILL ALSO ENJOY THE DVD ""IMAGINE"""
2,Images often take away from music,"John Lennon was great. This DVD, however, contains too much cheesy stuff that really doesn't help the music. I'm particularly disappointed that too often the music is undercut by reminders of John's death. What is the point of that? John's music celebrated life yet whoever made the videos self-indulgently kept putting in stuff that made viewing some of the videos depressing.Pass on this DVD."
4,"Great, but...","This is a great DVD with truly some of John's best work. But the thing that really bugs me about it is the video for ""#9 Dream""... In the song, May Pang (a lover of John's, despised by Yoko) is included. She's the one who whispers ""John"", but Yoko edited the music video to make it seem as if it were her. The implication here is that Yoko WANTS people to believe it was her. All of US know it was May, but future scholars and future generations who might have the video to go by will assume it was Yoko, and I am sure that was the reason it's edited that way.This wasn't really meant as a review, but I just had to point that out..."
3,Lennon's music deserves much more,"It's great to listen to some of the most beautiful and interesting songs of human kind in Dolby 5.1 or DTS, but I think there is an excess of manipulation to the videos and adds. I dont' think the footage in ""Happy Xmas"" shows the spirit of the song... John wanted to make a song which all the people could sing full of hope in Xmas. I know the world ain't right, but putting all those raw images during the whole song... is just going too far using that great composition.I get climbing the wall when I see Yoko didn't put the Anthology videoclip of I'm loosing you."
2,Happy XMas?? Are you sure?,"This has to be the worst video for a Xmas song. Seriously is it that important to show third world children suffering that much?Most of there children are suffering at the hands of American War fair, that must make it fair, look who they elected as president!!!John is abour peace not war, like the good ol' USA!!!"
1,Horrible Yoko Promo,This DVD is horrible. If it was really only about the work of John Lennon it would have been fine. But it is yet another one of Yoko Ono's attempts to convince the world of her own importance and confirms what many have always believed about her real interest in John Lennon's professional life: she saw in it a means to achieve her own imortality.
3,Good - but not what I expected.,"The sound is superb. The photos are good considering the age. The bonus features are excellent.So why couldn't they use the original videos when they exist? Sure, some of them are on here and some of the new clips are interesting. But why replace the live concert audio with the studio tracks?Like previous reviewers I also didn't need all the reminders about John's death. And worst of all is the Happy Xmas video. Yes, I know what Yoko was trying to do, but was it necesary to be that graphic? I couldn't watch it."
5,If you love John Lennon,I have been a huge Beatles fan since 1964 and this is a really GREAT DVD of John and his music.Do not wait to order this DO IT NOW !!!!!!!!!!
2,"Beware, Ono promo video...","I love the music on this DVD. It's wonderful to hear many of John's best solo works in 5.1 surround; BUT that's where the praise for this release ends. While some of the video is inoffensive, most of it is simply political and personal Ono promotional propaganda. I felt as it she was in the room picking my pocket. And what she did to the ""Happy Christmas"" video is a crime! I'll never be able to listen to it again without images of dead babies coming to mind. Yes, Lennon was a peace activist. I get it! But give it a rest Yoko. My advice is to either pass on this DVD (and buy the CD) or turn the cr@ppy video off while listening to the beautiful 5.1 mix."
2,Misrepresented,"This is not an all solo guitar recording as the product description states and as the title misleadingly suggests. Salinas sings or vocalizes on about a third of the tracks. I gave it a low rating to call attention to the lie. People that don't mind the singing will possibly buy this CD because of the singing but people looking for an all-solo guitar album will stay away.The guitar work is excellent on the solo tracks and it's worth the $4.98 that I paid for it, but I'm glad I didn't pay retail. Amazon should remove the product description."
5,BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL.,"BOLD, BEAUTIFUL AND INTRICATE. This piece just makes u feel like a rockstar! I've seen the same buckle elsewhere for almost double what I paid on Amazon. The flip out lighter is superstar! My friends mind were blown away when I pulled out my flame. However, its NOT A ZIPPO. The lighter is slim in design to be able to fit concealed behind the skull. The lighter is of poor quality. I had to take the internal parts of the lighter out and rebuild it to get it to work properly. Still worth every penny I paid. You can't go wrong with this piece"
5,An evocative essay on dog's special relationship to man,"Whether you have a dog (or dogs!) or just enjoy them, this book is the most touching portrait of the special relationship between mankind and its most faithful companion. From essays that make you laugh, to ones that will bring tears to you eyes, to the photographs that just warm you up inside, you will read this book more than once."
3,Two books - one good - one not-so-good,"In Carnal Knowledge one is treated to three stories. The first ""Surrender"" is by far the best choice. It is so much better than the others it reminds me of the good flick shown after the ""other movie"" which was once shown at the Drive-In! To be enjoyed the reader must however, be tantalized by submission. This erotica may not be for everyone, but it is certainly a step up from much of the reading available in the genre."
3,O.K. But NOT worth the $,"In fairness, I must give this product at least a 3, because it actually does work. However because it's ""organic"", in my estimation, it should work better than lower priced non-organic ginger root pills; Much to my disappointment, this is not true. Spring Valley ginger root pills are less than 1/2 the price at Walmart and work just as good as these $10+ pills. Don't waste your $."
1,"I'm so sick of man-hating CD's, and I'm a LADY.","I bought this CD due to the Amazon recommendation, and I'm sorry I did. Almost every song is a trieste on how she's been done wrong in a relationship. The songwriting is weak and her voice does almost nothing for me-it almost sounds as if she's talking. I should've known better-the first thing you see on her website is a list of the ""top 10 lies men tell"". These songs have no sense of 'I'm going to get over what you did to me', she's just bitter and miserable. Come to think of it, bitter & miserable is how I feel when I listen to this CD. Save your money."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I was extremely disappointed in this CD. The lyrics were generic..she's definitley experienced some heartbreak (as we all have), but EVERY song spoke about a man doing nothing BUT wrong. It's actually rather depressing. AND what further sealed the deal was the weak production. Every track was unmemorable and I've continued to listen to it hoping it would grow on me. It hasn't.. Overall her album seems to consist of weak filler tracks to the point where not even one song stands out. I wasted my $12.98."
5,Love it,This was my one of first collection when I became born again 20 yrs ago.... There are three songs added to the original album.
4,Destination unknown,"Most of Robert Nathan's fantasies are pretty straightforward, and although there might be a certain amount of ambiguity in them, the messages are clear-cut and distinct. This one ends on a more mysterious note. A train filled with passengers stops on a siding in the middle of a meadow. All the passengers have been rounded up by the ""authorities,"" have had their possessions taken away, and have been told they must go to live in the new country they are being transported to. They are trying to imagine a better life there, perhaps, but aren't exactly sure what to expect. The book ends on that note. Are they about to enter into heaven? Or, this being the immediate post-WW II world, is the destination much more cynical: a communist gulag, perhaps? Nathan never says. Nathan's array of unusual characters is on display, and most of the story is related through dialogue between the passengers. Okay as far as it goes, but Nathan had done better in earlier novels."
3,Not the best sticks...,"I used these sticks for P.E. in school, and it was really hard to learn how to cradle (keep the ball in the pocket by turning the stick), catching, and throwing. The ball kept popping out! It was also hard to play games with them, because whenever someone finally made a good throw, chances are that no one is going to catch it. The sticks give you no training on how you use a real stick. I tried to use a real stick with a woven net once, and it was hard to cradle because I was used to such tall sides. On the plus side, it was good having two different colors of sticks so you could tell who's on which team. All in all, these sticks are great for P.E. classes and teachers, but not so great for people who want to play the sport in organized play or those that are just learning."
5,Loved it!,"I purchased this on a friend's recommendation and I thoroughly loved it! Farr is definately a reader to watch!The Nobody is a wonderful romp that no Regency reader will want to miss. It featured beautiful prose, with very well-written characters and an interesting plot. I plan to order her back list now."
1,Poor Rip-Off of Heyer,"Truly an awful, torturous book! The very first scene drags on for a whole long chapter. I don't think that the author knows how to write, but she does know how to rip-off Georgette Heyer. The author tries very hard to imitate instead of trying to develop a different style, and so succeeds in producing a book that is bland and boring. This book is literally all talk and no action -- the dialogues run on for looong pages. If your looking for originality, characters and an actual plot, this is not the book."
3,"Endearing characters, charming writing style","I'm not a fan of many modern romances, but I really found this one to be the best I've read in years as far as Regency Romances go. Lovable and real characters, Diane Farr has a delightful sense of humor, coupled with an extensive vocabulary which she combines masterfully - made me enjoy the reading of it, left me wanting to know more of some of the minor characters. This is one worth reading and re-reading, just for sheer delight of the writing style."
3,"Beautiful, but runs slow!","I bought this watch as a gift for my husband, and it's GORGEOUS! He loves it and wore it every day, until he realized that it was always running slow! He'd reset the time, and within a day, the time was off again! Interestingly enough, the watch keeps perfect time when he's not wearing it; it only runs slow when it's being worn (weird, huh?) Seems odd for a Kenneth Cole, so it does raise questions about the authenticity to us....or maybe we just got a fluke!"
1,Never received,"I ordered this item some 4-5 weeks ago, and I still wait to receive it (it was scheduled for 3 weeks ago)...I wrote to the company yesterday but no reply yet."
4,Nice phone batteries are bad...,The phone is very good - the batteries leave something to be desired. Also - this is VERY overpriced here. Look at Uniden. They sell it for a lot less.
3,pitch...a lot,"Pitch a lot is the message of this book. OK, Leo has made his point, but if you accept that there's not much else this book has to offer. I was hoping for a bit more insight and didn't get it here."
3,"good book, but doesn't entirely deliver","OK, so just to make things clear, I bought this book to make a tubular lock pick. One of the selling points on the back of the book promises a $5 tubular lock pick. Now, professionaly made examples of this little gadget never go for less than $70, so I wasenticed. Unfortunately, the tubular lock section is 1.5 pages long, and provides one picture of a completed lock pick, not a detailed one mind you. GIven that the thing is pretty complicated (a bunch of small pieces of telescoping brass) this is FAR from satisfactory. An earlier book from the same author had much better instructions, but that's been out of print since he mid 80's.The other sections on conventional lock picks were good and extremely detailed, but as I bought the book for the one section, I definitely feel cheated"
4,Criminology Today: An Integrative Introduction,The author has presented materials in a comprehensive and easy to understand format. A good book to begin with for those who are new to criminology.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this handbook because the series had a terrific guide to Nova Scotia which I had obtained for an earlier trip there. That was not true of the Montreal and Quebec version. It was much less complete than the competition from Frommers in every way, from local history to places to stay and eat, and organized in a very confusing manner. Go with Frommers."
1,Don't buy from Winestuff,"I ordered the Reidel O stemless cabernet tumblers with gift tube, set of 4, from Winestuff. When I received my order, they were boxed in sets of 2, in normal boxes, not tubes. When I called Winestuff, they said the tubes were discontinued. They never called me to ask if I wanted another packaging in place of the tubes. They said - oh it must have been an oversight on our part and they were happy to let me return the glasses. That's not the point. There is a specific reason why I wanted the tubes! Why are they advertising a product that is discontinued? I will not order from Winestuff again. There are plenty of other places out there."
3,Feel Flimsy,"I like the smalller glasses, but I feel the glass towards the top is very flimsy. None broken (yet), but it feels like I am holding one of my old daughters sippy cup."
3,Riedel O,"The glasses were purchased for a holiday gift. The glasses look nice but are very thin. One glass has already broken, within the first month, while my wife attempted to pour a glass of wine."
3,Very nice but they did not last,"These were very nice glasses that I bought for my wife last Christmas and yet less than a year later, they are all broken. The glasses are VERY thin and must be treated like eggs. I need a glass that was a bit thicker and stronger."
4,Good glasses but one had small chip,"Love the packaging, love the glasses. Only problem is that one of the glasses had a very small chip in the rim. Since we took these as a gift to family in Canada, it was not feasible to return them. So, they will live with the chip and hope it doesn't get worse."
4,Very fragile,"good looking but fragile. tough to hand wash, and inconsistent results using the dishwasher which create chipped edges."
3,Works but their must be a shortage on mine,"I got this for my son for Christmas to go with his Leap Pad and it worked fine till just a few days ago. My son has been stuck on his Leap Pad ever since he got it and it seemed strange that he wasn't playing with it. He said it didn't work. When I checked it I noticed that it turned off when the adapter moved a certain way. I literally had to tape it down to his Leap Pad so he can play with it. Other than that, its fine. The cord on mine is pretty long and now that its taped down it does what its suppose to. If it wasn't for that shortage, I would give it 5 stars."
5,Does the job,I bought this for the leapster and it works great. It also fits in the leapster 2 with no problems. Helps save on batteries!
3,buying rechargeable battery instead!,"I bought it for use wiht a LeapPad. No complaints about the unit. It works just fine - no over heating issue, no buzzing noise. But the problems are related to the usage scenario:(1) although the cord is fairly long, you are still tethered to a wall outlet. Remember a tablet is after all a portable device!(2) the attched cord impedes free movement of the pad. To play some games, you need to shake the pad around, part of the gig.(3) if a child is such a heavy user and plays on a LeapPad for hours non-stop. Yeah, you may need an A/C adapter then. I set limits for our 5 year old, typically 30 minutes per session, up to max of 60 minutes.In summary, I agree with other reviewers that buying rechargeable batteries is a much better option. I am ordering Sanyo eneloop rechargeable battery pack now!"
3,indispensible for any leapfrog,I got this adapter for my kids leapfrog leapster. The leapster eats up batteries pretty fast - so the adapter is pretty much a must if you don't want to pay dozens of dollars on batteries.I highly recommend buying an adapter for your leapfrog and this one was pretty inexpensive.
1,Didn't last,"I got this item to save on batteries for my sons leapster. It was never used often, but after only a few months of use the leapster (which he only ever used with the cord) started acting up. I called leapster thinking it was their product that was acting up. They told me they were happy to work with me, but as step 1 to put batteries in to rule out the cord being the problem. Since using the leapster on batteries the leapster has been working 100% perfect. I believe I can safely assume that the cord / adapter stopped working properly. After reading other reviews I realize I'm not the only one who had this problem. For the relatively cheap price I paid it's not worth my hassle to try and get a refund, but I hope putting this review out there helps others not get stuck with a faulty product like I did."
1,No worth it,"Its suppose to be a charger but it doesn't charge. It's a charger that needs a battery. It doesn't work unless it's plugged while playing. Once you unplug it, the lead pad goes off."
1,Please do not waste your money,This charger does not work. I'm very upset with the fact that this item doesn't work. I expected more out of Leapster on this. We charged my daughters Leapster to take on a long road trip and didn't charge at all. We had to stop at stores and buy large packs of batteries to allow my daughter to be able to play while on the trip. Big thumbs down!!!!
5,Perfect,this is perfect for what i need it for. Thanks so much. Will do business again in the future. :D
3,Keeps the battery consumption low,This is a normal adapter. It does save battery consumption and is durable. I would recommend a longer cord... This one is just a bit too small for practical use.
3,Wish the cord was longer.,"Bought this so we didn't go through as many batteries. Wish the cord was longer. Doesn't reach from the outlet to the couch. Have to sit within a few feet of the outlet. Doesn't hurt my grandson to sit on the floor, but would have been a better deal if it had more length."
1,Bad!,"We bought the leappad for my son. After replacing the batteries a few times, I decided to buy the adapter. It worked fine for a month or so. The leappad we bought completely died. Wouldnt turn on. Contacted the company, because thankfully it was under warranty. Got my replacement and went to set it up using the adapter rather than batteries and it wont turn on. Put batteries in and it works fine. Now, I cant say for sure, but this bad adapter may have caused our first leappad to crash. The adapter will not work anymore. At all."
5,Absolutely essential,I love the LeapPad but the battery is definitely lacking. This little guy's come in handy many many times. You definitely should pick one up unless you wanna go through batteries every couple of days.
1,Never worked,Was never able to use it . when I got it it was not working. it wasn't worth my time to send it back.
5,we love the adaptor,"we love the ac adapter. We were going through alot of bateries, and finding games all over the house. Now it stays put in one place. We are saving the landfill from batteries."
5,a must have,you MUST own this so you arent spending hundreds on batteries all the time. the leapster eats through batteries like crazy. this has saved lots of money.
1,Real bad,This will not recharge rechargable batteries in the leap pad. You have to get leap pad rechargables and they don't tell you that.
2,Great Buy,I purchased the leappad and decided to buy the adapter for it. Since i purchased it i have not put any batteries in to use it. This saves me alot of money so that i can used the batteries for when we are on the go. It is a great idea to purchase this with the leappad. My kids have hours of fun without me having to worry when i need to change the batteries.
1,Does not work with Leapster 2,"Bought this charger for my daughter's Leapster 2. We had one previously and it worked great, but the dog decided to get ahold of it. I ordered this charger-the picture shows the same black charger we had previously. However, a white charger arrived and the plug in is too small for the hole on the Leapster 2. Do not buy this for the Leapster 2!"
2,Not a Good Fit!!,"Powers the device if you can keep the plug from falling out. Makes me wonder if it was even designed for the Leap Pad.Thinking about sending it back. I have to use a rubber band to keep the plug in the power port, looks awful."
2,Not very happy with Leapster A/C Adapter,"I was so excited to get (I did not buy it through Amazon) this adapter for my children who love playing their Leapster games. I did not use any batteries, not even rechargeable ones while my kids or I (only for checking it out) played games. My kids and I discovered that the Leapster shuts off whenever the plug-in is moved/touched... That's frustrating, especially for the kids. Imagine being in a middle of a game and ...BOOM... it shuts off. Otherwise (whenever we did not touch/move the plug into the Leapster), it worked, and the kids were able to play the games at least for some time. But I do like the idea of not using the batteries."
1,Falls short for Leapster,"Purchased two as I had purchased two Leapsters for my boys. After replacing batteries over and over, I was excited at the prospect that did two things...1 - lower my battery budget and 2 - hopefully cause my younger one to stay in one place for a little while. First time I tried it, it caused the Leapster to freeze and no matter what was done, it froze at the same point each time you restarted the Leapster. Caused the leapster to become worthless.....even with batteries!!! Not a fan. So, if you have an additional $50 to spend to replace the worthless Leapster, then go for it, and roll the dice. All I know is I'm no fan of this adapter!"
1,cord stopped working,"I tried several outlets, checked for damaged looking areas and it just stopped working after under 10 uses! Won't power up the charger or either of the 2 Leapster Explorers we own. Batteries work in them so it has to be the cord. Never had cord failure before. Weird."
2,A must have for your Leapster2,"If you buy a Leapster2, don't fail to also buy this adaptor. Your child will love his Leapster2 and if you have the adaptor as well, he won't be frustrated by running out of batteries. Plus, you'll save money."
1,Leap Frog A?C Adapter,"Not the right type for power points in australia, not going to bother to send it back as it I didn't spend too much on it anyway."
2,Leapfrog Could Of Done Better.,"I was so excited when I recieved this charger for my sons leap pad! I took it out of box, plugged it in. Then took it off the charger and handed him his leappad.. Nothing.. I had no idea it didnt take a charge and that my son would have to sit and play with it plugged in the wall. Leapfrog could of done better with this. Ohh well."
3,Just a plug,I'm not sure why I thought this would work like a Nintendo DS plug but I bought it for the intention of saving myself on buying tons of batteries...Looks like I'm investing in rechargeable batteries
1,Do not buy! Did not work,I purchased this product to use with my daughters leappad. Well it was a huge mistake. It only worked for 2 days and then it would not charge the leappad. I would not recommend purchasing this.
2,Disappointed,"And this may not be the fault of the adapter, but this doesn't charge the battery, so it's pretty useless... You can't use it on the go, and unfortunately, thats when I need it the most. I gave it two stars b/c it does work... just not how I thought that it would."
2,Poor design,This has a great cost however this product is made to work with a toddler's toy. Every time the Leap pad 2 moves a little the cord pops out. So really it does me no good. When it is used I have to tape it onto the Leappad 2 to make sure it stays attached. Next time I will use my money to buy rechargeable batteries instead.
4,Helps save your batteries,"Like the power adapter saves on your batteries... but you have to sit in one spot to use it (you can't go farther than the cord), which can cramp playing style. But it does what it's supposed to do. No complaints."
5,works great,this does what it does well. it is a plug in and works great. My kids can go thru batteries quickly so this is a great alternative and a lot cheaper.
1,weak product,I brought this product twice. It does not last long. my son used it for 2 1/2 months and it stopped working so I bought another and the same thing happened. waste of money
3,Maybe you're kids will sit still...,"This charger allows your LeapPad to be played without batteries. However, ours sits idle because the kids like to move around while they play. You're probably better off simply getting rechargeable batteries. At least the batteries will have other uses outside of the LeapPad.If this is the same charger used for the LeapPad 2, then probably worth buying since the LP2 is rechargeable."
5,Works great on Leappad,"We purchased this adapter for our 4.5 year old's Leappad. It is not the black adapter as pictured though, rather, its white and more rounded-looking and is the official LeapFrog brand. We purchased it for under ten dollars here on Amazon. It works just fine. I love not having to replace batteries every few weeks!"
4,Great for instant play at home...not as described though,"Picture is not product I recieved. Mine is white and obvious to tell apart from all other chargers, plus says LEAPFROG on it. Nice. It has a very long cord, I'd guess 6 ft. Great for not having to sit too close to outlets in the house. It can be plugged in and reach the bunk bed without struggle in use. Of course never let a child go to sleep with a cord. Still it's length is impressive. Don't have to wait for batteries to recharge or blow money on the 4 batteries it takes and works for 4-8 hours(Leappad).I think it generally works about 6 hours on good batteries. That costs a lot, so this is helpful and rechargables are great for the road."
5,exactly what was ordered,"Pays for itself in no time. When plugged in, it provides power to the device which also helps to keep my daughter in one place. Batteries kick in when she disconnects and keeps her playing and happy."
3,Adaptor Purchase,The process of ordering and delivery are first class and I will use Amazon again in the future.Unfotunately the power adaptor I purchased was of no use to me as in Australia we have a 240 volt power system compared to your 110-120 volt system
3,short circuit,the product arrived in a timely fashion in New condition it just seems to short when you move while relying on the adapter to power the leap pad
4,Great if you want to save on batteries.,This is a great choice if you don't want to constantly be buying batteries for your kids leappad. It worked great with the leappad 2. I just wish it fit in my daughters pink carrying case.
5,LeapPad2 Explorer is working again!,"My daughter loves her toy, and for some reason, the AC adapter included stopped working. I bought this one, even when it says that it is not compatible with the Explorer products (I decided to give it a try) and it works perfectly. It is EXACTLY the same that came with the LeapPad 2. Buy with confidence!"
1,Poor,I hate this thing. Every little moment you make the leap frog pad reset and my son gets sad. Grr
5,Great Songs,"This album is great for those of us who are fans of Rescue Me. It includes the title song from the show, plus a variety of other music. Good CD to just play when you're hanging around."
2,Not What I Expected,"I love the television series RESCUE ME, and I thought this would be the type of mellow, melancholy music heard at the closing of episodes. Instead it was mostly hard rock, and not so pleasing. I gave my copy away."
5,"I keep coming back to listen, sing, and cry",There is no artist like Jason Pyles. I do searches for new music from this artist and found that he has moved on to doing movie reviews. I guess his life is in a different phase right now. I love this music so much that I had to write a review. I am disappointed that his music isn't on more music listening stations. I know that this music would be a major hit if it had more air time. If you want something new to listen to that is gospel centered and inspiring you should try Things to Come. I love it!
1,Too much preaching,"I was totally disapointed in this series. I liked the movie better. The first book in the series kept close to everything I've seen. The last two in the series, Good Wives and Little Men, was absolutely Boring! I didn't finish all of the series. Too many times, there was nothing but preaching about how a lady should act. It made me feel that I was the worst person in the world for believing it was ok for a woman to feel emotions in public. I guess it was the time period that the author was raised in."
4,"The author deserves 5 stars, the editing 3, thus the average of 4","At the start of the series note is made that the publisher did not just scan the pages in, but provided hand editing of each page. I was quite excited to revisit this old friend knowing someone gave Miss Alcott's volumes the respect they so deserve. It was quite disappointing to discover the editing no better than a scanned version. I suspect a spellcheck program as there were many errors such as ""to"" when ""too"" was appropriate, or ""stalking"" versus ""stocking."" However, the beauty of the story and its characters made it hard to close the book after that last page."
5,The Complete Little Women Series,"I love the this series and to have all the books to read in order makes for hours of enjoyable reading. For readers who like the classics and, if you are like me, you like to reread them every few years or so it is great to have them on the Kindle. A mother and her four very different daughters growing up during the civil war whilst the father is off fighting. There are at least three movies made of the first book; my favourite being the second version with June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor and Margaret O'Brien playing the daughters."
5,What an Absolute Treat!!,"""Little Women"" was just the first book in a series of four books about the March family. The subsequent books go on to tell the stories of the characters as they travel through the years of their lives. It was so rewarding to share in their happiness and heart-breaks. These susequent books showed how their unfailing belief in God helped them get through some of the most difficult challenges they faced. It also showed how they never forgot to show their gratitude for all their blessings. Their faith was unwavering. These books were a great inspiration to me. I hope they will be for you also."
5,Very inspiring,"I may have read this as a youth, but glad I read it as a grandmother with more understanding of life."
2,Typo-plagued Technical Text,"The RAID book 6th edition, a work by the RAID Advisory Board, is a bland, technical description of RAID technology. The explanations of topics are rather theoretical and/or academic in nature as opposed to books that explain things by relating them to their application(s) in the real world. To make things worse, the text is poorly proofread--errors in spelling and formatting make the reading more painful.The one bright point about the book is that it is written and supported by the RAID Advisory Board, so the information is coming from a body of experts on the subject. This book is not for beginners in RAID but may be appropriate for advanced users and as a reference book."
5,Everything New,Filter just as OEM in my ION price very competitive much better than the one I removed this was stamp made in the USA
4,QUALITY HENGST FILTER UNDER A/C DELCO LABEL,"Was pleasantly surprised to find a high quality made in the USA Hengst filter shipped under the A/C Delco label. For a new cap, a new gasket and a new filter, the price on Amazon was a bargain! Best to replace the plastic filter cap about once a year as these things will crack over time. And the price of a cap plus filter is only a few dollars more than the filter alone. Only thing I could have asked for different was a protective plastic cover over the filter. Unlike store bought filters which come protected from abrasion and foreign particles in a plastic bag inside the box this one was in the A/C Delco cardboard box with no protective cover. But filter appears no worse for the wear."
5,It works.,For warranty purposes this item is to be replaced when replacing the compressor. It's main purpose is to filter metal particles from the fluid. I am unable to determine if this is any better than one that costs more or less than this one. Anyway it is installed and seems to be working just fine.
3,warping fun,"this game is fun, but gets hard when you get into later levels. its identical to the geneses version, so if you like that youll love this. theirs alot of animation going on for a game gear game. this game also has alot of continues for thoughs who die alot."
2,Buy This Carpenters Set Last,"Of everything the Carpenters turned out, this is probably my least favorite. I only like about half the songs, and the album is really too mellow for my flavor (I prefer the earlier, jazzier Carpenters stuff from the tan album and Ticket to Ride). The gems include ""I Need to Be in Love"" (available on some of the greatest hits collections), ""Sandy,"" and ""Can't Smile Without You."" I also enjoy the cover of ""Breaking Up Is Hard to Do,"" but the rest of the album sounds the same. I recommend buying the other 8 original Carpenters albums and Karen's solo release before thinking about this one."
4,"Carpenters, A Kind of Hush","""A Kind of Hush"" contains some great songwriting--some of the most mature the Carpenters recorded. As always, Karen's vocals are spectacular and the pair's harmonies can melt butter. Standout tracks include ""Can't Smile without You,"" ""One More Time,"" ""Boat to Sail"" and ""I Need to Be In Love."" The problem with ""A Kind of Hush"" is that it's a smooth jazz album at heart, but Richard ""popped"" it up by creating arrangements accented with a repetitive country-sounding guitar (I suspect no one in the mid 1970s thought a smooth jazz album was commercially viable). There are a couple of full-out missteps. ""Goofus"" strives to be innovative but ends up a train wreck and ""Breaking Up Is Hard to Do"" is one of the flimsiest records the duo ever produced. While several Carpenters albums are more substantial than ""A Kind of Hush"" (""Close to You"", ""Carpenters"",""Made In America""), it should be included in every fan's collection as a notation of pop musicians striving for transition."
2,Kind of Hush,"I ordered the CD laboring under the impression that it was a Karaoke CD and later found that it was just a regular CD. If you have the same CD in Karaoke, please let me know."
4,Good album from Carpenters' Middle Period,"I think of ""A Kind of Hush"" as the perfect middle point in the Carpenters' career. It is the album where they were simultaneously looking at where they had been in the past and where they were about to go with the daring ""Passage"" album. Richard has stated that he was never happy with the ""Horizon"" album, AKOH's immediate predecessor, because it dragged too much. If you look at ""A Kind of Hush"" in that context, you realize it really is an improvement over that album since it is much more light-hearted and moves along at a steady pace. I think the standouts on this album are the title track, ""You,"" ""Can't Smile Without You,"" and ""Boat to Sail."" I really don't mind the more silly excursions like ""Goofus."" That just shows that Karen and Richard had a sense of humor when it came to their albums."
3,The Slope,"In 1976, as Karen's anorexia was taking root, the Carpenters recorded their 7th studio album. This album breaks no ground musically and seems to mellow out at times. However, Karen's voice redeems it and I still must give it 3 stars. ""A Kind of Hush"", the group's #12 hit is not as creative as ""Please Mr. Postman"", and the ending ""Breaking Up is Hard to Do"" is not worth hearing. ""You"" is lovely, and so is ""Can't Smile without You,"" but clearly the best song is ""I Need to Be in Love."" Although it charted only at #25, the song is sung very heartfelt by Karen, and it carries the album. The songs on the second half all seem to sound the same, and clearly, one can see the Carpenter's slide down the charts beginning. The single ""Goofus"" charted at #56, making it the group's lowest charting single to date. However, the album deserves to be heard as it does have the greatest vocalist of all time."
3,A Kind of Hush,"This album although not as good as other Carpenter's album, still allows the listener to once again enjoy the beautiful sound of Karen's voice. My only complaint is about the remastering of this album. The mix does not do this album justice. The bass is mixed to high, the strings and background vocals and instruments are mixed too low. The mix on the original album was a whole lot better. The vocals and instruments were more balanced. I rated this album three stars because of the remastering."
2,Old Retreads Of Early Chicago,"One of the reviews above states an outright lie! This album has NOT seen ""astronomical sales"". Unless ""astronomical"" is defined by 500 copies sold. It is also not a ""masterpiece"". Overzealous reviews like these fanatics are misleading to level-headed fans who might get fooled into buying products like this. This CD is nothing more than mellow dinner muzak, full of major7th chords straight from the Lamm Lounge. It's not new, it has no musical or lyrical edge and relies on the tried and true Chicago formula from 1969. Hardly innovative or fresh. There are some sweet moments here and there in the songs Gimme Gimme, Intensity and Everyday It's Always Something. They stand out against a deluge of normalcy and safeness. Save your hard-earned $$$ for buying something better here at amazon.com such as the new live CD by The Dave Weckl Band."
5,A Masterpiece !,"To keep it VERY simple. If you love melody, heartfelt vocals, GREAT crafted songs, playing & production. S & P MUST be in your player ! This goes straight in to my top 50 musical works. LOVE it ! Thanks, Robert."
5,Robert Lamm at his best,"Robert has done it again. He just continues to prove what a great musician, and songwriter he is and has long stood the test of time over the years. This CD is a hidden treasure, such wonderful lyrics, a well done CD from start to finish. Everyone should grab a copy of this and listen, you will find yourself playing it over and over. I have been a Chicago fan for years."
2,Paintball Co2 HPA Heavy Duty Coil Remote Qiuck Disconnect & On/Off,"I bought three of these... Thought they would be great to get the weight of the guns. If your thinking of using one, think of an additional slide valve. (The ""On/Off"" in the name is not what it sounds like.) Without one they become a headache. I only used them once, and I'm back to putting the bottle back on the guns."
4,"Helpful, not a must have","It is worth reading, but I believe that it should be read in addition to a couple of other books to prepare mentally for law school. The two others I went through are; How to succeed in law school (munneke) and The complete Law School Companion (deaver)."
2,"Nice Idea, Horribel Execution","I bought these in hopes of cleaning my rat cage at a faster rate and with ease, but they are hard to open, hard to pull out (I had to rip them, the perforation doesn't seem to be of any help), and they leave behind a strong odor. The first time I used these I had a crazy asthma attack. I was coughing and wheezing for DAYS, so just imagine what my 4 male rats went through since their respiratory systems are much more sensitive than mine. And my sister hated the odor too. After just 5 minutes in my room after cleaning the cage, she couldn't take the smell anymore. This was HOURS after I cleaned the platforms in my rat cage. Conclusion: they clean the cage, but I would not recommend these for allergy sufferers/asthmatics or animals with sensitive respiratory systems."
4,Truly miraculous,"I use these to clean my rats' cage and toys, and they are fantastic! As others have noted here, the smell is rather strong, but it does dissipate after a little while-- and it's definitely preferable to the smell of a stinky cage."
4,"For small jobs, not entire cages","Like other reviewers, I have a problem with the smell of these wipes. I can't use them for entire cage cleanings. The smell gets extremely strong, especially in glass tanks. Even if they have screen lids. I use a regular bottle of cleaner and paper towels to clean full cages. But these came in very handy for cleaning litter trays and wheels. Since silent spinners don't drain waste all that well, these came in handy to wipe those out on a daily basis. I can use the same wipe to clean the bottom of litter trays as well (my dwarf hamsters are ""potty"" trained). It's also nice to use if your rodent does it's business in the free-roaming plastic balls. If I cleaned out entire cages with them, they'd be too expensive to use over a bottle of cleaner. But super convenient for daily cleanings!"
1,Constipated to the very end...,"After reading and re-reading the epochs of Marian Zimmer Bradley and reveling in past life memories of long ago England, I really was looking forward to a repeat performance and renewed love affair with the characters and the energy of the time frame. I was so disappointed with this ploddingly slow, over-detailed, mishmash story.The characters began as intriguing and the authors did breathe some life into them, but later only in a comic sense, overdrawn and exaggerated. There are some good scenes, and a fair mystery along the way.I finished the book.... somehow, and over the time of several months. But its not one I'll keep on my shelf for future reference and re-reading."
4,"Good, but...","A good read, but it seems as if the authors were trying to shove down my throat every little detail they could about the Norman/Saxon situation, especially at the beginning. Hard to keep track of the character's names. They all begin to sound alike after a while..."
5,best band period,i visit san fran once a year. when i'm in town i hit four or five shows. Mover is always th best night every time. this band rocks . hello to pete and nora in san fran.
5,One of the great lost albums of the 1970s,"In 1971, South Africa folkie John Kongos tried his hand at rock. This album produced two thunderous singles, Tokoloshe Man and He's Gonna Step on You Again, and all sorts of other goodies. There are two beautiful folk songs (I Would Have Had a Good Time and the countryish Gold), and several other cuts featuring Kongos's distinctive guitar style. This CD also has Weekend Lady, a cut that for some reason was left off the North American version of the original LP. Has various hard-to-find singles, but alas not his impossible-to-find ""I#7""/""Slow-Talking Boy"" single from 1975 -- both sides of that one are wonderful."
1,DON'T BE DECEIVED!,"The description uses the word bulk, so I didn't even think about the 16 oz. size description. Do not be deceived into thinking you are getting a large quantity. This is the same size bag you can buy at your local drug store for $2-$3 less than you would pay here. Very disappointed at how they mis-portray this as being ""bulk"", this is just your everyday average bag of Tootsie Rolls."
5,They are great!,"Who doesn't like tootsie rolls!!! They are awesome! If you've never had a tootsie roll, you need to try one."
3,In Defence of Kay Hooper!,"In answer to the two previous vitriolic reviewers who have SHOUTED abuse at the author. If they cared to look further than the title they would notice that the re-issue date for this book is in 1984. That makes publication of Kay Hooper's book some 20 years prior to that of Mark Reed's (just in case their mathematical skills are as limited as their research skills).So should we be accusing Mark Reed of stealing Ms Hooper's book titles, or are the reviewers just easily confused?"
2,Snake Guard,"The Snake Guard shipped promply and arrived in good shape. Don't know if it works or not it has only been used a few hours. I rated it low, not on the product but because I felt it was advertised and priced to receive two for the $25+ plus $8+ shipping. Pretty high for only one piece of cardboard with some glue on it. I wouldn't have paid that for only one."
5,Very Talented Trio,"The first Ephemera album I bought was ""Balloons and Champagne"". After falling in love with that album, I went on to buy ""Air"", ""Sun"" and then added ""Monolove"" to my collection. I don't think they are given alot of attention in the states, although they may be more popular in Europe (and Norway). They are like a mix between Dido, The Cardigans, and Sixpence None the Richer. And if you like any of those artists, then I would recommend these girls to you. I love their light, lilting voices, and the textures, sounds and styles of their songs are all varied. Their sound is like a mixture of country, dreamy guitar and sparkly pop. I love it."
3,"good contecr, photos too old fashion","Photos of the books are a bit too old, some are not very clear may be because they are not original photos or old photos."
4,An enjoyable murder mystery.,"I really enjoyed reading this book - it was a quick read, though thoroughly satisfying. The Gleaming Secret moved quickly and I had a hard time putting it down! I look forward to reading more about P.I. Morgan Todd's cases."
1,Amateur Whodunnit Yarn,"This book is trite, derivative, and wholly lacking in suspense.The only glimmer in this work is how obvious the conclusion turns out to be. Next to this the Nancy Drew mysteries look like Shakespeare.Save your money for worthier efforts"
5,truly beautiful,"this CD is worth purchasing for the cover of ""i'll be your mirror"" alone... hauntingly beautiful, of late i have had it on repeat... a good intro to the band if you don't already know them... all of the rest of their CDs are truly worth it, a hidden gem that unfortunately not enough people seem to know about yet... catch them live if you can, eef has a wonderful sense of humor and their performances are always right on. can't wait til they record the ryan adams song."
1,It over-heats quickly,It was a fire hazzard. The equipment got really hot really fast and it was missing a cable. Sent it back and got most of my money back. They wouldn't cover shipping and handling.
2,MY LAST E. BEVARLY BOOK,"Well, I guess HOW TO TRAP A TYCOON was a fluke. Either that or it was written by someone else. Once again, in my opinion, Ms. Bevarly has failed to write a good contemporary romance. With so many really great and humorous authors out there, why waste your time on this book? As in HE COULD BE THE ONE, EB's use of ""um. . ."", ""hmmm. . ."", ""ah. . ."", ""and. . .and. . .and"", ""of. . .of. . .of"", etc. is just so irritating I wanted to scream. Is this supposed to be cute or endearing? If so, if fails miserably. I did actually manage to finish this book (unlike HE COULD BE THE ONE) but the only way I accomplished that was by skipping over the insipid language - which was half of the book. I give up. No more wasting my money on EB books."
1,it's not the cd's fault,"the cd arrived shattered , when I posted the review the first time it was removed without my permission. oh well I will never order anything from Magic bus records again!"
4,"Good read, definitely worth the price","After reading this book and it's sequel I can definitely say this is one of the best books for the price that I have read so far. The plot is intriguing and fast-paced. The characters are believable and relate well to each other. Some of the scenes seemed to lack depth, but overall the story was very good and I would read more by this author."
5,Great read!,This is a great read! Never dull with lots of visual imagery. I am hoping one day they decide to bring this book to motion pictures!
5,Rare Find,"This book starts with the humble man Gavin who the reader will share his adventure and learn to fall in love with his character. His loyal friends all make a lasting impression on the reader and there is a hope that the book will never end.Not all is revealed in the beginning, and towards the end the reader is still learning new things at the same time as the characters."
2,"Ok, did I read the same book as everyone else?","I mean this book was painful. The characters were completely one dimensional. The storyline was adolescent. Within the first quarter of the book I could tell you the ending. And the writing itself? Juvenile. The only reason I gave it two stars is that I have read worse. Still, this was a painful read and I certainly will not be buying the conclusion to the series."
4,This needs to be a movie,"This was a great read that is full of action and has not a single dull moment. I could easily picture it as a movie production. I hope the writer is doing his best to sell it to movie studios! Also, it's a steal at 99 cents."
4,A Good read,"I got the electronic version because to the review of Piers Anthony. I remembered loving his Incarnations of Immortality series as a teen. So I was willing to give this book a chance. After reading throught the sample, I was hooked! I enjoyed the pacing. It's not as expansive as the SOT books, but I look forward to the next book in the saga . . ."
4,Entertaining and satisfying,"K.C. May has given us a very entertaining fantasy-adventure story. Fast-moving, consistent, compelling and as original as it needs to be, the story is fairly short (as fantasy novels go)yet still yields a satisfyingly complete and complex experience. The Kinshield Legacy clearly can support a sequel and I'm looking forward to the next volume, The Wayward King. I'm pleased to add this book to my collection and highly recommend it."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Won't get too much into it.Pleasantly surprised by this novel.Appears it has been edited and plot moves along well, fast paced.Well worth the price!"
3,Good plot - but lacks something,"This book has an interesting plot line which is a little derivative as is the case in most fantasy novels. It seems to jump around a lot with far too many coincidences, scenes that seem like they were written for comedic value (I hope), and quite a few cookie cutter characters. I did think the main character was well written, but the villain was a cartoon (I kept thinking of the evil villain, Gargamel, from the Smurfs).Worth what I paid for it (under 3 dollars), but if I'd paid full HB price I would have been disappointed. Here's hoping the author improves as she hones her craft."
2,Not very good.,Written at a juvenile level but has way too much sex in it to be OK for kids. It's OK for a buck but I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for this.Points that really bug me:The warrant knight is like our police but when they arrest someone there is no battle or fuss. They just tell the person they are going to be branded on the arm and everyone goes their own way.Many plot twists involve Gavin the soon to be king running off to find a bit of knowledge he could have found if he jsut asked around a bit.The king is going to be named by solving the runes and everyone knows the runes are being solved but for some reason there is no crowd waiting to see the next rune solved
2,Sorry I Wasted Time Reading This,"I bought this book after another reviewer had compared it to George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice & Fire series which I thought was fantastic. But the Kinshield Legacy was full of cliches; and the characters and story-line were generic, trite and utterly unremarkable. After a few dozen pages I thought that maybe the book was marketed to young-adults but the frequent sexual innuendos and references (also dull and tiresome) suggest otherwise. This is my first review in years but I made the effort so that other readers can avoid the same fate I suffered. If you're looking for better sci-fi/fantasy, stick with Rothfuss' (""Name of the Wind"", the first of a trilogy called the ""Kingkiller Chronicle""; note, though, that book # 3 has not yet been written); or a classic like ""Dune"" or Orson Scott Card's ""Endgame"". With all of the great books not read, I'm kicking myself for wasting my time on this trash."
2,Never say never,"I was intrigue when I bought the book that women are included as warriors. I was expecting more fighting than behind the scene drama. With the women and the warrior who solve the puzzle of the tablet. The book is an easy read and a good price. But I would like to see more action in battle, sex and words. The characters seem real enough but, the overall conversation and action is to sweet or overly to nice. Why I gave it a two star rating. Hope the second book is not the same as the first book which have 4 & 5 star rating?"
5,I loved this book!,"I am not usually a massive fan of fantasy books, but had seen a lot of positive comments about this book, so decided to give it a try.Ms. May has written a complex story, with lots of threads, and woven it together very skilfully. I like the little flashes of humour throughout the story, and I can see Gavin's horse getting his own fan page on Facebook before long!There are quite a few characters in the story, but, unlike some books, they are introduced in such a way as to make it easier to remember who they are and what they are up to.I am really looking forward to the release of the sequel."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I was looking to find a new series/author and with the rave reviews I saw and it being only $0.99, I said why not? Partial into it I realized how absolutely horrible this book is. This is my first review of a book and I felt compelled to write one just to try to balance the rating. I'm not quite sure what the target audience is, maybe a 5th grader but the book was lacking in all areas. No character development, heroes who run back and forth for no apparent reason and absolutely flawed in their reasoning."
5,Do you like fantasy? Yeah? Just buy the damn thing. its excellent.,"This book is well written, cheap, is fairly long, has an engrossing story, is filled with humor and action. Really I don't think I need to say more its simply a great read and its only a buck. Seriously just buy it."
3,Popcorn Fantasy,"I'll call this one popcorn because it's like a popcorn movie - somewhat enjoyable to watch/read, but not satisfying in any way. This one hits pretty much all of the fantasy tropes and doesn't really give you anything substantial. I blew through this in a day over a holiday. It was a really easy read. The characters are fine, and the story is fine. If you don't have anything better to read, this is worth the $0.99 I paid for it. Wouldn't be worth much more and I don't plan on reading the conclusion. Nothing in this volume really made me care much about what will happen."
2,Really boring,Just could not get into it. Am looking for something to fill in until George R.R. Martin puts out another Ice and Fire book... and this wasn't it.
2,simplistic and childish,"sorry, I just found this so childish, perfect as a young adult or teen book, less challenging than a Harry Potter book and really not adult. I am mystified by these reviews. However, I am finding that amazon reviews, in the past year or so, have been uniformly too good and too enthusiastic and lack any criticism at all."
3,A solid B effort,"Great ideas, good characters who need some consistency and development. Also, the pacing and execution of this book is pretty erratic. I kept thinking what a great book this would be in the hands of a Sanderson or a Rothfuss. I'm not sorry I read it, but I won't be looking for the rest of the saga."
3,"Almost, but not quite","May has a long way to go to be able to compete with the big leagues of sci-fi. I enjoyed reading this book, but I consider it more of a ""beach book."" The story is straight forward, the characters are not complex, and the land is a bit lack-luster.I think this book is worth its price. If you are looking for a quick and easy read, give it a shot. I think that May is an author who should be followed. May is now established as a decent storyteller, and with a few more books may become a much better and complex writer. One of the aspects where you see May's unique twist is within the descriptions of the use of magic. I enjoyed May's take on reading hazes, empathy, and an amplifier. I will certainly keep an eye out for more of May's book."
5,Took a rewarding chance,"I'm a big fantasy genre reader and I took a chance on this book going off of the story summary. Generally, if a story can't pull me in in a couple of chapters I'm out, but that was never a problem w/ The Kinshield Legacy it pulled me in right away. It has a great plot line and great pace that made it very enjoyable to read. Something I liked about The Kinshield Legacy that I don't like about many books in this genre is that it isn't geared toward kids making it to me all the more enjoyable. I loved the book and I'm anxiously awaiting The Wayfarer King."
4,Good Solid Fantasy,"At the start Gavin Kinshield enters a cave to solve a rune getting right into the story. The story then promptly moves along. Gavin Kinshield must solve a mystery concerning one of his ancestors but in the process must deal with whether or not he has a duty to his kingdom and its people. There is also a strong woman character, Daia Saberheart, although she isn't the main character. But I do like having a woman in the story who doesn't sit around waiting to be saved. She defies her father in order to reach her own goal. There is also a nice romantic tension between her and Gavin. The main villain, Brodas Ravenkind, is a formidable opponent to the main character.If you enjoy traditional 'other-world' fantasy adventure, this is a good choice. I wouldn't rank it with the top fantasy writers but it does give more than value and good entertainment for a day's reading pleasure."
3,Pretty good Fantasy story,"Well written and entertaining, the story unfortunately offers nothing really new in the genre. The plot is fine enough, but the characters come off as a bit stereotypical at times. It's not bad, and is worth the read, but I probably won't read it a second time."
4,"She liked it, but too expensive and slow shipping","Nice necklace. The stone was a little dark and seemed more like a plastic stone in cheap costume jewelry, but the woman receiving it seemed to like it anyway.Do not buy it online if you need it within a couple of weeks. The day after I ordered it, I went to a big chain department store and saw the same thing for half the price. I paid for shipping a product when I could have just picked it up myself. Too make matters worse, the shipping took longer than promised, and did not arrive until after Christmas. So if I had just gone to the store, I would have paid 60% less and had it in time."
4,acceptable,"The quality is as good as could be expected. Keep in mind that in could only have been taken from very old reel film. I purchased this solely for Snake Crane Secret, but it seems to have had the first 5 - 10 minutes edited out. I hate that.If you are after the COMPLETE version, keep hunting."
3,German Joy Devision,"Fliehende Stürme (in english: Fleeing Storms) are big Fans of old Joy Devision and you clearly here this influence. The Drummer Andy uses only real Cymbals, the rest of the drumkit are E-Drums which do have a solid sound.The songs change from fast-in a way hoovering Songs to slow and midtempo tracks. But one thing they got all in commen: they are deeply melancholic.For all english language listeners: sadly the songs are all in german but even the music is worth listening and maybe someone is going to translate the songs.Lean back and enJoy.This CD got only three stars becuase I think and suggest to buy the better albums ""Pristhill"" and ""Himmel steht still""(in english: Heaven stands still) from the same Band."
5,Light and Easy,This easel is very light and easy to take from place to place and easy to assemble.I need something light weight and easy to assemble when walking from building to building on campus and this does the trick!
4,Even a women can start,"I was looking for a cheap unit and didn't expect much seeing as you get what you pay for.($67.00) This little unit is light, starts easy and has plenty of power. Cut through tall and flat lake shore grass with ease. One tank of gas lasts about an hour even at mostly full throttle. Would have gave it 5 stars if it included a shoulder strap; but again I didn't pay very much. I made my own out of some rope."
1,Poor Product and Deception,"The product works a few times, now does not work no more. Product deception, EZ start. It is hard starting. I would not by this brand again. The product is poor quality and workings. I would not recommend anyone to by this brand and product."
3,Good for price,"I was looking for an affordable trimmer that is easy to use, this was it. Good buy however all things have a down side and this was the string after the initial roll ran out. All the major departments stores sell single string and this item came with a double so there is now a issue now when it cuts short."
4,String trimmer,"A little hard to start the first time, but starts and runs great after the first use. Great product for the low cost. Does everything I expect it to do."
3,Basic trimmer,Bare bones machine- I will wait to see if it is reliable. Starting procedure is ridiculous but it seems to run well. Packaging was all beat up and taped closed.... appeared to have been opened before. It seems all the E retailers like to pawn off their store returns by mail.
4,Entertaining book,I had borrowed the book from my library and knew I wanted to own it so it wasn't a shot in the dark.
4,good book,This book is very nice and has interesting food in it. The pics are very nice as well. Surprising how simple Italian food really is.
4,Cats love it!,"Our cats sleep in the basement at night (due to owner-head-jumping activities at all hours); In the winter they were not happy as the basement is the coolest part of the house.I picked this up as an early Xmas present for the cats; as far as I can tell, they love it---they are always on it at night.The device is a rigid plastic board with a cloth wrap and a metal encased electric power cord (it's clearly cat safe; it's probably dog-proof, too.) One side is warmer than the other (I used the warmer side up, with another blanket on top.)This product would be perfect if the power cord were slightly longer and included a timer (which we added, seperately) to turn on and off automatically."
1,Also no HEAT :o(,Pad came in a plain brown box without any directions. Pad doesn't heat and now after spending good money my porch kitties are still very cold....not a happy customer.
1,UNSAFE FOR PUPPIES!,"I bought this product for a new puppy I'd gotten for Christmas. We are trying to kennel train her but she absolutely hates it. We were told to put a watch under her bed to represent a mother's heartbeat and a heating pad to represent a mother's body heat. At first I was hesitant about the heating pad b/c of the cord. But the box clearly stated it had a Double insulated chew-resistant cord with AC adapter. Well she didn't chew it at first b/c we kept a close eye on it, but in 2 months (after we had let our guard down) we had to throw it away b/c she had chewed right through the cord while it had been plugged in! Thankfully she wasn't hurt, but they shouldn't label anything chew resistant, when it clearly is not!!!"
1,"lies, lies, and bs",i read through this book while at a bookstore and as a current student at TU it's full of a bunch of untruths. the best way to find out about TU is to come to campus and check it out for your self
2,Not very well made.,"I was very excited to purchase this figure for my collection.But, upon receiving and putting it together, I found that the arms would easily separate from the body and this means that they are limited in their posability. and the 4 lightsabers that come with the figure are useless as they cannot be held by the figure because his fingers are way too pliable. Also, this figure does not match the size of all the other 12"" figures. So, it's not well proportioned to all my other figures. Kind of a shame. I'm glad I didn't pay $90.00 for it!!On the plus side, the figure looks GREAT. It's more as a display item then a toy for me."
3,"Looks nice, but Brittle.","The arms fall off while you take it out of the package, fine. But when you try to put the arms back on, the joint brakes off. There is no fixing it either, arm is too thin. The figure looks very nice. That is all."
1,Came Broken,Came broken and Eck's Shack would not replace it and doesn't answer my e-mails. This was a gift for my ten year old grandson who loves Star Wars. I wish I could say he loves it but we sent it back to show them we weren't lying and they never refunded the money. They basically called me a liar and left it at that.
4,this is a very versatile and interesting album!,"You got to love these lyrics! Although the styles differ throughout the album, the writing is solid. I love the ""sunnechoenig"". Very nice."
1,"These ""names"" are not even names","I checked this book out from my local library (without looking inside first), and found that most of the so-called names in this book are not names at all. It was like reading a dictionary. Here are a few examples: celery, carrot, go, car, I could go on and on. I am all for unusual names, but please consider your children! Also, there is no listing for which of these supposed names are male or female; just an alphabetical list of words. If you are truly curious about it, please don't waste your money, go to your library - personally, I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
3,so many names for one baby!,This is a great book to find an unusual name for your new baby. The preganacy journal is an added benefit for new mothers. Makes a nice baby shower gift.
1,Would not send book,"My credit card was charged for this book 16 days ago, but I still haven't received it. They will not address the issue yet. They said I will have to wait another week before they will do anything."
5,Class Act,"Lou lived the American Dream and did it with God as his mentor. Every coach has something to learn from Coach Holtz reading this autobiography. Every player can relate to the lessons in life and apply them improving their quality life, making them a better athlete."
1,very flimsy...stay away...,"The watch looks very cheap. After all discounts it was around $32, very good price.BAD:The Benetton box in which I received was so worn out, it seemed it was in warehouse for a long time.Above all it is very very flimsy..I had to return it. Not worth it..stay away."
3,Great for everyday wear!,"I got this for work; it works out nice. It is funky and clean, modernish. The strap is definitely a navy blue-the picture shows it darker than it is. So, be aware it is definitely navy blue. I like the color and appreciate the other review stating that. The band is a little ackward to get on. But on, it lays down nice and the face is low enough not to get knocked around too much.It is a great buy at $19.99 for a name brand and style. I gave it 3 stars since I haven't judged it's durability. It has been fine this week.Note: I would not purchase it for a gift-the box did arrive worn out from being on the shelf. Packaging tattered, the watch inside just fine. 3 stars overall."
4,Gakuen Heaven: Complete Collection,"Gakuen Heaven: Complete Collection: I really liked this series! It had a really nice story line. There is, I thing one Boy on boy kiss and if that is a problem for you, don't get it. But there is intrigure, mystery, and tales of loyality. The characters are defined and the plot is great! I recommend it!"
3,Cute series,"I bought the first two dvds when they came out and didnt buy this set until just recently. I LOVED the first two dvds so I couldnt wait to watch the rest of the series. Well...the second half of the series isn't anything like the first half . Its not the worst thing, but I could have done without watching it. If I hadnt bought this set and was just rating it based on the first half of the series, I would have given it five stars. Despite the slow, generic storyline, the writing was great. However, because of the second half, I only give it three stars. Still a good watch, just not for everybody."
4,"No english dub, no real problem. Cute story, great writer(s).","Without spoiling the thrill of a new story, I'll simply tell you that the art work and animation was good quality and the voices were only moderately whiny. (You other anime fans know what I am talking about.) It moves FAST and there are some big jumps, scenes that would cripple the animators were cut (understandably) but over all it was a well balanced show. I would have to skip breakfast all the time, lol."
4,"A nice, common story.","This is one or my more favored yaoi stories just because I like the characters and their personalities as well as the fun humor that brings it all together. The story is a bit generic but the artwork is great. There isn't much special with a story about a boy that was accepted into a school filled with beautiful boys and it tends to lack something to make it unique, but I do like the story's simplicity. I won't give any details about the story because I want others to watch and experience this story themselves."
5,amazing,im happy i got this game. im living my childhood all over again. i love it and thank you again.
1,"3 cd,s and i will tell you it sucksssssssss big time","if you think this cd is sick you are right,i got the cd,s and im sick to my stomach ,but i will tell you something get [ A STATE OF TRANCE ]BY ARMIN VAN BUUREN mix 2006 ,the songs are not to long but the songs are verey good 37 great songs to my opinion yes 37 songs and the mix is verey well [ DONE ]good luck if you get this cd."
4,"Nice performance, subtle difference in engine sound","The stock instructions were understandable. A few steps were missing but easy to figure out. I would recommend installing this in a well lit area. Be patient, the intake and the air filter should not be touching anything within the car.In response to the increase torque and horsepower, you can really feel the performance within 1-4 gears. Not much difference in sound, which I prefer. ""Silent but deadly""..... I have an 2004 Acura RSX Type S, not much room in the engine compartment, so be sure to adjust the intake near he throttle body for proper placement.Other than that,a solid intake..."
3,Paranormal Boredom,"This is another Paranormal Activity copycat... With that being said, its probably the worse of the bunch. Paranormal Entity was actually acted out pretty well and was creepy to boot. Paranormal Effect has some of the most flat acting I've ever seen. Not believable in the least. Even the scares are flat... Nothing scary here unless a normal guy tackling you is your idea of paranormal. I recommend this flick for fans of ""found footage"" horror but just don't expect this to be nearly as good as the movie it so clearly was inspired by."
1,Paranormal apathy,"This is the worst of all the ""Paranormal"" type of movies. Even the tv shows that deal with the paranormal topics are WAY lot better than this"
1,sickening violence,"the violence in this film is really off-putting. it is a dreary story of some really unpleasant characters. it is quite sickeningly violent, as other reviewers have noted. these characters are indeed haunted-but don't let them haunt you!"
4,Ecco II,"An awesome game! Ecco, everyone's favorite dolphin, is back and with more abilities than ever, having kept the powers the Asterlite gave him in the original. However, when the Vortex Queen returns to Earth and distroys the Asterlite, it's up to Ecco to save him and defeat the Queen--once and for all! The only thing I see wrong with it is that it doesn't let up--usually in a game you have a hard level then a few easy levels to kinda catch your breath then an even harder level, but here you don't get any breathers."
2,Don't look too close.,Service was great and we got what we paid for. Two inexpensive table lamps that without close inspection look good.
1,lame,i purchased two of these on monday on a 2day shipment plan. its friday and it still hasn't even shipped.....
5,worked great in my 2007 accord remote key lock,Worked fine on my 2007 Honda Accord remote key fob. It was an easy installation and the packaging was easy to open.
3,"Good concept, needs better execution","I like the concept of this book, but I think it tries to do too much and falters. The pull tabs add interest; my daughter says the English words and I say the French. But it isn't clear what age group is targeted -- the words seem too advanced for a 4 year old (for example, the first 2-page spread ""the farm"" has 20 words including orchard, plow, henhouse, and farmhouse, which wouldn't necessarily be the first French words I think she'd need to learn). However, I think the pull-tab idea would not hold the interest of an older child of 7 or 8. The left-hand drawings are also quite busy. Probably I would recommend it for reinforcing vocabulary but will try the story books instead."
1,Warning Not Bluetooth,"I ordered this to replace a Bluetooth version that fell and broke, this one is not Bluetooth and I had no way of knowing before the sale, I ended up replacing the broken one with parts from this one"
4,Nice read,"Will use some of these ideas in my daily life-i got 2 sons (3&1 year) and really some of these ideas weren't new, but in our busy schedule it's good to have a book like this to remind us that all the kids need are play (among all other necessities :))"
5,Great book!,I enjoyed this book so much that I actually ordered 3 more for friends and family. Mr. Cohen does a wonderful job of reminding us there is a reason for every behavior (even whining!) and to find those reasons. There are some great tips on how to incorporate play into almost any situation.
5,Loved,"I loved this book. It gave me a different prospective on raising and understanding my child. It takes practice to get the hang of it but after I read this book, my baby whinned a LOT LESS. He seems happier."
4,A great Book about Connecting with your kids through play,"In this fast paced life we lead it is easy to become disconnected from our children in so many ways. I found this book extrememly helpful for connecting with my kids through play. Cohen used personal examples that were interesting as well as gave play by play instruction for those of us who have forgotten how to ""get down on the floor"" and enjoy the things our kids enjoy. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their relationships with their children."
5,Great book,Both my husband an I find the book very helpful as a reminder of the magic of play even though we were already playing A LOT with our children. Insightful suggestions from a clinical perspective
5,Packed full of info!,"This is a GREAT book. I have put some of the tips to use and can already see a difference in my relationship with my kids. I try to make them laugh everyday now. This book gave me SO MUCH insight that I so needed as a parent. The only thing I thought the book was missing was maybe some summary points/suggestions at the end of each chapter. All of the tips are within the stories and it is hard to remember them so I need to get a notebook to write everything I want to remember down. I am a fast reader and this book is taking a long time for me to read to absorb it all.But a great book, full of wonderful advice and a great price. I will go back to and read again and again. Highly recommend!"
4,We liked the concept,"My husband was already practicing ""Playful Parenting"" but I am sure others would benefit from some of the concepts presented. We have connected with our adopted daughter through playful parenting-she is very attached to us."
3,Not what I had hoped,"This book is a little too ""psycho babble"" for me. The author gives a lot of explanations by describing moments between himself and his own children that I did not find helpful. I felt like the book could have been only a few pages long and still gotten the same message across. All he really needed to say was, ""Play with your children, even during discipline."""
2,"Nice thoughts, but would have liked more concrete info","Like a lot of books written by therapists, this contains many beautiful stories and a lot of nice ideas, but not much concrete advice. It tells you to be playful nd why that's important, but offers scant suggestions about how or what to play with your baby/toddler/child."
5,Inspiring,"This book is exactly what I was hoping it would be and even more besides. It's an easy read, there's not too much child psych lingo, and it's entertaining.Most importantly, it inspired me to connect with my son. I was having a difficult time being silly and playful with him, and I'm sure other parents can relate. If you have to be serious 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, then come home to a sink full of dishes and many hungry stomachs, it can be hard to turn all that off and just have fun. Children need love and playful attention just as much as they need three square meals a day.This book also addresses the difference between playing solo, with other children, and with a trusted adult. You may think, 'well, my kids have each other to play with/ he plays very well by himself,' but playing with an adult is still important. The author does a great job of explaining the distinction.Can't speak highly enough of this book!"
3,Not happy with (lack of) response from Mopar,"The product came as promised. I had a question about the product pre-purchase to Mopar that was answered promptly. I had a question post-purchase and have never seen a response. The product was easy to install, but the rails slide and my question was if there was a way to tighten them because we attached a snow board rack and want it secure. Never heard a word once I purchased. So I'd say after-the-sale service from Mopar was non-existent."
5,Better than OEM,"I bought these because I collapsed my original crossrails with too much weight :( These are of the same exact quality, weight, and style of the OEM rails, no problems what so ever."
2,Yikes! A bit dated.,"This was an amusing enough mystery, except for the jarring racial references. The characters keep describing Asian people as ""Oriental,"" which has been an offensive term for at least, what, 15 years? And the stock young-girl-forced-into-prostitution literally has her speech represented by swapping the l's and the r's. This book needs an update for 2008, but I can't quite understand how it was written this way in 2004."
3,A must for Hal Oszan fans,"Look, I'll be blunt: You've seen this movie before, many times. So many, in fact, you can actually predict what's gonna happen next. However, Hal SHINES! For those familiar with his old band Poets & Pornstars, there are a couple songs from that time plus a couple of new ones. This is why you must have it (plus his acting, as per usual, is superb!)"
5,The real bossa nova,"I literally just saw this group perform. Maggie Grebowicz has a beautiful voice and the band meshed very well with each other. They're arrangements flowed like water and the selections made you feel as if you were in Sao Paulo sipping Caprianas.If you appreciate""The Girl from Ipanema"" and want to expand your bossa nova horizon, pick up this CD. If you're an avid lover of bossa nova, pick up this CD. If you enjoy good jazz, pick up this CD."
3,Fascenating and Enjoyable,This series of tapes is most interesting to those of us who either lived through the Kennedy Assasination years or are history buffs. I promply transfered these tapes to CD so I could listen to them more easily. Well worth a listen.
2,Nothing fast about this book!,"I was really looking forward to this cookbook for some fast vegetarian recipes. I'm sure there are some great recipes in here, but there is nothing ""FAST"" here. Maybe someone thinks 20 minutes prep time and 50 minutes cooking is fast, but that's not my definition of fast. All the recipes are from scratch and all the legume recipes start with overnight soaking. Other then that, the book was shipped fast and arrived in good condition."
1,Don't order,"Don't order, this product has been discontinued thanks to the EPA and not removed from the website yet. They sent me a similar but wrong product instead. They processed the return without a problem."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I recently tried this mag cleaner after being pleased with Eagle One products such as their Nevr-Dull. However, I was so dissapointed with this cleaner that I doubt if I will ever buy something from this company again. Not only did it leave a lot of dirt and brake dust on the rims after much vigorous scrubbing, but it permanantly ruined everything else that it came in contact with. This is an EXTREMELY caustic product that will destroy everthing except the dirt on your rims."
1,HORRIBLE! STAY AWAY FROM THIS,"Tap is so brittle, it feels as if it was made of ceramic. Bought two sets from towerhobbies, and broke both taps within two holes. I didn't overtwist, and also used lube. I am experienced in tapping, but never experienced such a shoddy product. STAY AWAY! Buy a better quality tap from mcmaster."
4,A Good Overview of Soteriology,"Having just finished this book,I can say that it is mainly focused upon Jesus as means of salvation, our 'human need' for such salvation and lastly God as overall image of Jesus' life in Judea and his message of repention that O'Collins is overly concentrating on. Whilst being somewhat brief in the historical arguments surrounding his storyline, O'Collins is fair to both sides of the various debates, choosing to portray one main thesis, (eg. St Augustine), against a critic and moving along with a peppering of Biblical quotes proving somewhat tedious as the book develops, (I suggest an appendix is needed). His inclusion of recent films like Mel Gibson's 'Passion' and New Zealands Peter Jackson interpretation of L.O.T.R.- to describe human sin, (the one ring analogy, p127) is very well linked into the whole explanation of humanity as fallen and in need of 'healing'. Apart from that, it is overall well worth investing in and adding to any Theological collection."
1,book made poorly,I had to send it back the first time because it fell apart. And now the new one in falling apart.
2,"Very informative, but...","This has been a good, detailed book up 'till now. While doing homework I noticed pg's 69-100 are MIA! I bought this book NEW from Amazon."
5,Sliding shower door hook,It was a wonderful piece. Is there any clear color piece? That might be good for any color of a bathroom door.
1,Crooks!,20 Bucks? What a racket. Theres less than a buck in materials making these. They break prematurely and should of been made of metal anyway. My next shower door wont have this garbage on it. For 60 bucks to replace these every few yrs its like buying a new door all the time. Junk...scam!
1,missing part??,did not come with gasket which allowes you to tightnen the hook to the door. door still slides but not very secure
5,Amazing,This album is amazing! Its wondrous how well the music of Bach blends with the recordings of the pathfinder rover. Great for relaxing.
2,Product is Older Edition Than Advertised in Amazon Ad,"Excellent product as written when published; however, it is not a current edition. It was represented as being the latest edition and listed as a ""used"" book, BUT not stated as being an earlier edition."
2,mauser self-loading pistol is disappointing,"From internet I learned that this is one of the 3 main reference books on the Mauser C96 Broomhandle; and it is considered a disappointment. However the price is much more affordable than the 2 other books, so I still decide to buy a copy.The book is full of pictures but not of the high quality one would expect nowadays on the internet. The text carries some information, but no more than the several websites dedicated to the Mauser Broomhandle.Since I bought the book after consulting the websites dedicated to Broomhandle, I really felt that there is no new information to be learned from this book!"
5,One Question,"It's very interesting that there are five ratings before the DVDs are in the shops. No person has ever seen the Season Two on DVD. I'm shure they are great and I pre-ordered them - but I can't make a rating!Wolfgang BuschfortBocholt, Germany"
2,I've Actually Watched It,"LAST UPDATE: After 2 copies from Target stores and 1 copy from Best Buy the sound at the beginning of the second episode on Disc 1 is still out of synch.UPDATE: I just came back from exchanging my DVD where I bought it and the sound at the beginning of the Zero Mostel episode is still unsynchronized. Now if you want to say that information isn't useful, then by all means go with one of the Season Two reviews from May (3 months before release). Good luck!I just picked up my copy of Season 2 a few hours ago and I'll have to return it since the sound is out of synch on the only episode that I've watched (Zero Mostel). The audio mismatch was pretty bad too (not something you can ignore). Although I'm glad that they obtained the musical rights to everything (so I hear) I was disappointed to find that the trivia popups feature from the Season 1 release was absent from the special features of this release."
2,They messed up!,"I watched most of the episodes on my Muppet Show Season Two DVD set, and I noticed that in most of the episodes, the audio is out of sync with the video. I'm talking about the scenes in the beginning of each episode in the dressing room with Scooter and the guest star. I'm not sure, but it might be like that on all of the DVD copies of The Muppet Show Season Two. It's a mistake that might upset people, but it's still a fun DVD set to watch."
4,The Muppet Show Season 2,"The season two was bought as a gift purchase for a birthday for my spouse. The entire season did seem to like a bit of what we had seen in seasons 1 and 3. For the most part, we've come to know and understand that season two apparently just the headway of season 3. We did like it, however, in some parts of the shows are a bit slow getting started. This is not to say it was worth adding to the collection."
4,Muppetmania!,"If you're a Muppet fan, this collection of the Second Season of ""The Muppet Show"" is a treat. Plenty of great sketches and celebrity guests, with the classic Muppet humor! Great DVD quality as well."
4,Gotta love a classic!!!,"Just like season 1, this DVD does not disappoint! It's got great episodes and is fun for the whole family! The extras are a bit sparse, but because there are so many episodes, there are hours of enjoyment either way! For anyone who is a true muppet fan, or just looking to reminisce this is a great product!"
4,Good product,"My children and I enjoy the Muppet Show, and Season 2 is better than Season 1, in my humble opinion."
4,I miss Muppet Morsels! (and closed captioning!),"While I'm overjoyed that season 2 is FINALLY available, I echo the disappointment that others have stated. I want my Muppet Morsels! That by far was the best bonus in the Season 1 DVDs. Also, as both of my parents are hearing impaired, I'm used to watching closed captioning and am disappointed to find that they didn't bother to CC the musical numbers. I would give the shows/season 5 stars, but I have to give the DVDs only 4 stars, 'cause I KNOW they can do better than this. However, even without the Morsels, the DVDs are wonderful (and way better than the Fraggle Rock sets so far).Another tidbit, when I opened the set yesterday, my Dad looked through the box and asked me when Miss Piggy got sexy. The pic on disk 1 is not the Miss Piggy you grew up with."
5,24 episodes of great family entertainment!!,"Waiting for season two of the Muppet Show on DVD was well worth the wait. Over a year in the making and it paid off. The 1977-78 certainly features some of the people that have entertained us in the past...Don Knotts, Edgar Bergen, Nancy Walker, Zero Mostel and more. I enjoyd Rowlf singing ""What A Wonderful World"". This collection certainly brings the best in family entertainment come alive. I am already looking forward to Volumes Three, Four and Five!!!"
5,Love those Muppets!,"I loved this show when it was on T.V. in the 70's and 80's! Now I can share the ""Mayhem"" with my kids!! They love the shows and would rather watch ""The Muppet Show"" than t.v. If you have a sense of humor and a love of ""old"" television I highly suggest ""The Muppet Show"" We have season 1 and season 2!!"
5,Lots of fun-brings back memories,"So wonderful to see these performances again. Cleaver, creative stars in a different setting (!), and good , clean fun! (missing from alot of today's TV!)"
3,Where are the Muppet Morsels????,"The episodes are, of course, wonderful with a stellar line-up of guests. But where are the Muppet Morsels that we so thoroughly enjoyed with the Season 1 DVD's? We looked in vain for them on Season 2, and the episodes seem empty without them. What a disappointment! The Muppet Morsels, with endless factoids that constantly answered questions we had asked or were about to ask, were a high point of the Season 1 episodes, and we had really been looking forward to more with Season 2. I just hope a special edition version of Season 2 isn't going to come out later with the Muppet Morsels."
1,Blades bent,"The first two times I used the product, it worked fairly well. The first potato was difficult to push through the blades, but after that, potatoes slid nicely. On the third use, one of the blades bent, rendering the product useless."
5,WORKS PERFECTLY,"This cutter was in service within 5-minutes of my opening box and reading directions. Washed the cutter and parts, dried them, installed the larger (1/2"") cutting board and pusher, turned a little handle to clamp the cutter by suction to the counter. I purchased the Jumbo potato cutter because I wanted longer fries/chips. The longest Russett spuds fit perfectly. When you open the double sided (for leverage) handle, the pusher moves to the end opposite the blades. Insert the potato and uniformly lower the handle which pushes the spud through the sharp blade block. Worked great and we enjoyed perfectly cut fries. The cutter stayed on the counter without my having to hold it in place. Easy. Performed as advertised."
1,Garbage,This thing is a giant piece of garbage. You have to cut the potato in half to even get it to work and then you have to use all of your force (im 6'2 195) to even get it to cut. I was afraid I was going to break the handle but instead the blades broke. Do not waste your money. I would give it 0 stars if possible.
2,Metal doesn't hold up,"You have to cut your potatoes down in order to get them to push through reliably - too big, push to hard and one of the vertical metal peices came out. Recommend to spend a little more to buy a better product"
5,Very satisfied,This is not the first one of these I have purchased. It is a great product for the money. An industrial version would cost you 5 times what this one costs. It does a good job and seems to be quite durable.
5,Enjoy Great French Fries,"We love this product as it allows us to make a smaller cut, crispy, french fry!!!It's easy to clean and the transition to different sizes is quick."
3,Need replacement parts,"I really like the potato cutter. It makes making french fries REALLY easy and quick. But the big blade broke now I need a replacement. So if anyone can tell me where I can get them, please let me know! Other than that, it's a really great product!"
2,Design problems,"I purchased this item to cut potatoes into french fries so that we could cook them in the T-fal fryer, but the slide lever pivot point on the blades broke while trying to french fry the 3rd potatoe. This product is not designed well enough to handle a good potatoe!!"
2,not sturdy,"I only used this once and one of the cutting blades came out of it. Cost wise, not worth returning and would order again."
4,Great for the money,"Works very well, huge potatoes are a little harder but still works well. Average size works the best. Would recommend"
4,Liked,This product workes well and cuts the potatoe easily. Not much use other than that but it is helpful if you have a lot to cut. Also cleans up nice for next use.
1,Possibly defective.,"I recently purchased this product because I was in the market for a potato cutter and this seemed to fit the bill. At first glance, it looked like I had made a good purchase. However, there are two main issues with this product. First, the suction cup barely works. It will hold its grip about half the time. Second, the blades must be dull because the potato cutter was having a heck of a time trying to cut through a small potato... Even after the potato had been in the microwave for a few minutes. Hopefully the potato cutter I received is just defective and Amazon will replace it for me."
3,You have to be strong!,"I was wanting to be able to use potatoes for more than mashing or baking, so decided to give some frys try. I would suggest that if you don't have the power of a 40 year old, you may want to think twice about the amount of pressure it takes to actually push that Jumbo potato through the slots. I am still able to do this with some pounding action, but I fear that this Grandma will have to rely on Grandpa's hands to do it, or stick with the knife. It is a nice looking piece of equipment, and it cleans up very well. But I would caution the older generations to think about it first.Progressive International Vegetable/French Fry Cutter"
5,Good product,I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who likes potatoes but doesn't want to spend forever cutting them. Great product. Makes it very easy to make fries quickly. Glad I bought it.
1,Impossible to believe that ANYONE can cut potato with this,"I saw Brian's video, which made me hesitate buying, but when I read all the other reviews on how great it worked, I thought maybe Brian's was defective.Once we secured the base, verified the LARGE cutting edges in correctly - and put a peeled potato in - my husband pushed AS HARD AS HE COULD. After about 15 seconds, the most he could get through was ONE INCH OF CUT POTATO!Perhaps microwaving first as one other suggested could work, but we didn't want microwaved potatoes and needed them raw. And NOWHERE in the directions or sales promo does it say you have to cook the potatoes first.WORTHLESS!"
1,Avoid if you are using for sweet potato,I just received my jumbo fry cutter about an hour ago. I cut one potato and the thing broke. It is has a very low quality plastic body. Avoid at all cost
2,Not Enough Leverage,"It was doing the job with the big blade.After a few uses I decided to have thinner fries so I switched to the smaller blade but the lever was unable to push the potato through. I applied too much pressure and the whole thing broke, it is unusable now.I hate to cut fries with a knife they all come uneven. I will buy a restaurant quality cutter I hope for better luck then."
2,Not made to last,"Nice Idea. Has two sizes which are great, which is why I gave it two stars. It worked for small store bought potatos, however, when I used nice Yukon Gold potatos from my garden, they were more firm. It could not withstand this potato, and after only my second time using it, the metal frame bent on one side and I can no longer use it anymore. I thought that for the price it would be worth a try. But considering it only lasted for two batches of French Fries, they were some expensive fries afterall."
4,Breakable but otherwise works fine,"This is our second cutter, the first one lost some blades when the potato's were apparently too much for the cutter. First one lasted a few years before breaking. This new one seems just the same so I expect to get about the same performance but might just keep the potatos cut in half to make it easier for them to pass."
3,its okay,"i had this 2 weeks and really liked using it but sad to say in the second week i was dicing a potato as i have done a few time before and the blade broke :( the othe blade wasnt the same size as i liked to cut my fries so it was very disapointing, maybe it was just my luck? either way it went in the garbage because i coudlnt find my receipt to return it so i bought a better made more expensive one that i know is made for cutting potatoes"
1,potato cutter is a waste of money,"This potato cutter looked like it would work well; but, it literally fell apart the first time I used it. 2 of the metal blades fell off the cutting grid. Total waste of monry!!"
3,MISREPRESENTATION,"I purchased this product because it said the blades would cut 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch fries, well the littliest one is 3/8, there isn't any 1/4 to it! I was wanting the small size specifically, so I was so disappointed!!!! Other than the size, everything works fine, this is actually my second progressive french fry cutter."
5,FRIES! FRIES! FRIES! AND MORE FRIES!,This jumbo cutter is the bomb!A good french fry cutter -- accommodates most potatoes (unless they are ginormous)!Be careful . . . you may make more than you need.
3,Doesn't quite cut it,"I bought this in hopes of making my own sweet potato fries but it didn't quite work. After reading previous reviews, I bought small sweet potatoes. The potato cutter didn't make it through a single potato unless I microwaved it for a couple of minutes first. Once I softened the potato by cooking it a little, the cutter worked."
1,Cheap and Junky!,Ours bent the first time we used it! Very disappointed!! The whole item just seems cheaply made. I would look for an all metal cutter. This one is no good.
4,It's OK,"We got the cutter for Christmas and have only used it a couple of times. So far, trimming off the ends of the potato has enabled us to use the cutter without much problem. I do think a trim makes things go through easier and is highly recommended. This size of the cutter has been more than sufficient for any potato we have used."
3,typical import quality,"We, that is my wife and I both use the device for potatoes and carrots. We also have tried onions which is an exercise in futility.If the potatoes are hard we can't push a whole one but must first cut them in half as we don't have the strength or the machine doesn't have the leverage. On top of that an inexpensive machine became ""not so "" when the shipping charges were added on!"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"This was a bit disappointing for me. I felt like I was reading a copy of readers digest, but for a lot more money. Although I found what some of these people have gone through to get where they are now worthy of applause, it just did't do much for me. To be honest...I did'nt need to read this book."
5,A Book That Inspires Transformation,Gay Hendricks did it again! Yet another wonderful gem to inspire and transform lives. I picked up the book the same day I brought it home and noticed that I couldn't put it down. It was one of those serendipitous evenings when I was looking for inspiration and was reminded of those few special books I've read in the past that offered revealing insights. I resonated with several of the stories and found myself making a list of new books to read to further my own process of transformation. What a terrific idea!
3,Just so-so,"I've read a lot of these types of books - famous or accomplished people talk about the books that changed their lives. This one was okay. The flaw - to me - was that it had too many famous people from the same fields - too many books reccommended by sales persons, or self starting entrepreneurs, or marketing types. Many with a religious bent. On the flap of the hard cover it says ""their richly varied stories are poignant, energizing and entertaining"". I didn't find it so. The stories definitely were not richly varied. Good effort, good idea, average execution."
3,Life Changing Examples of Books that Made A Difference,"Life Changing Examples of Books that Made A Difference....55 different people from all walks of life from around the world all shared their individual influences.This book is neither easy or difficult to read - one must be in the right frame of mind to absorb the dramatic shift in what influenced all of these people.From ""Chicken Soup from the Prisoner's Soul"" to CS Lewis' ""The Great Divorce"" to Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" to ""Don Quixote"" to ""Teachings of the Buddha"" are only representative titles of the offerings.The contributors include authors, entertainers, entrepreneurs, religious figures, names we know and others we have not heard of, but the common thread is the influence a book's message made on them.I read 75 to 100 books a year and often skim some of them. I cannot say I enjoyed this book, but it really made me pause and think. Check it out for yourself!John HoganHospitalityEducatorsHogan Hospitality"
3,Kenny Loggins' Contribution Is Excellent,"Most of the contributors are authors most of whom I wasn't familiar with. But one entertainer I knew- my own musical dad Kenny Loggins author ofThe Unimaginable Life: Lessons Learned on the Path of Lovewhich isn't even mentioned in the book. So what book inspired him? No not The House of Pooh Corner which took the name of one of his first song hits butSiddharthaby Hesse andAutobiography of a YogiThey helped him through an emotional period and his life and took the meaning of peace that he brought to songs like ""Celebrate Me Home"", ""Leap of Faith"" and ""Conviction of the Heart"" all of which have special places in the hearts of Loggheads (Kenny Loggins fans).Write your autobiography one day Kenny, or at least a book on the stories of your songs."
1,Dissapointing,"I loved the idea of this book, but I found almost all of the entries to be lightweight. I started every entry and had to skip most out of boredom or disgust. If you are into self-help books perhaps you will like this book. If you enjoy literature or just good writing I think you will be better served elsewhere. Somehow it seems telling that monsieurs Canfield and Hendricks included their own entries; I think this book is more about self-promotion (not necessarily only their own) than great-book promotion."
1,You DON'T have to read this book!,"What a total waste of time. If you read at all why read this when you could be reading some of the books mentioned. Half the people mentioned in this boook I've never heard of. Besides what other people find inspirational is not necessarily what you will. If you read books based on what some no name celebrities read, you need to expand your horizons a little."
3,A Distinct Disappointment,"I bought this prodct mostly for its battery extending characteristics with only an after thought to the speakers. After opening the product I got my first taste of what was to come when I had to struggle to place the PSP onto the connectors. The second suprise came when I plugged it in to begin charging the battery. This incessant huming alarmed me! I thought that maybe after it was fully charged it might stop but no luck, it still hummed and purred like a ferocius robo cat.There are some distinct advantages to this cat, however. The battery life of the unit is a great addition to the PSP's lack luster one and the metal case does provide good protection to the otherwise fragile PSP.As long as you arent watching a silent film then the performance will be just fine but I would suggest skipping this product for a future release."
3,"Great sound, poor battery charge retention","PROS:1. Attaches easily to the PSP.2. Sounds great.3. Fills a small room easily with sound.4. Recharges PSP5. Comes with cables to attach to PSP so you can play games outside the case.6. Solid, protective case.CONS:1. Looses charge within a week of fully charging even if not used and left in the off position.2. Young kids may destroy the speakers since the speakers are exposed and look like buttons.3. Doesn't hold any additional game cartridges."
4,smith3675,"The product is great over all. The case doesn't allow for anything except the PSP, but does provide secure housing for the unit. For traveling on an airplane its fantastic, dual phone jacks - brilliant. As far as sound, there is no humming as reported in earlier models. However, the sound is not the greatest - which makes my rating one star lower. Overall I'm happy with the product - if the sound was a little better I'd be completely happy."
5,Great addition to the Fat PSP,"If you have a fat psp and want an excellent movie experience, look no further. It lasted close to 10 hours on a charge with a full psp battery as well. It also comes with a handy charging cable that enables you to charge another psp as well as your own from the same charger. The sound quality is excellent and has a surprising amount of bass and very crisp highs.Buy it :D"
2,falling apart,"This was a very difficult book to locate, so I was happy to find it on amazon. I knew the book was very old, but felt misled as to the condition. You can't open the book without a couple more pages falling out. The binding of the book is completely shot...no pages stay in it. I believe $42 for this book, in this condition is very overpriced and would not have paid that much had I seen the book in person first. Live and learn."
1,Do not buy this video,"This video is a joke. The video and sound seem like it was produced in someone's garage. Most of the video is wasted time -- people talking, stupid music, etc. In consequence, there's no time to show a lot of exercises, and the ones they do show are glossed over. It could work as comedy, though."
2,Dad's Perspective,"Both my girls loved this movie (shocker), so I thought I'd get this PC game for them. I felt bad after trying to get it set up, though. I should have read the box more carefully. Buyer beware, your computer must have a 3D graphics card to play this game. Even with a brand new Dell, they typically have an integrated video card that does not support 3D games. If you don't have one, the game will still install and play- but not too well. Backgrounds and some objects will appear white. You also need at least 256MB of memory.Also, as other kids have mentioned, it doesn't really have that much to do with the actual movie. It gets two stars for being horse related.......so my daughter says. I let her play it on our newer Pentium 4 3Ghz and it's fine. Great movie, not so great game. Hope this helps..."
3,Okay game,"This game was alright.The graphics are pretty good,and so is the selection of horses.The jumping courses are kind of hard,and the dressage competition sometimes asks you to do things that you don't know how to do.But otherwise,it is a pretty good game.Not very hard to figure out."
1,Do Not Buy!,"This game has many glitches,and is almost completely un-related to the movie,except for the name Dreamer in the title and the horse named Sonya!The trail's too confusing,and almost everythings messed up.I feel bad for making my mom buy it,it was 20$ down the drain.I wish I could give negitave stars..."
3,"It was okay, but a little decieving","When I asked for this game for Christmas awhile back, I asked for it under the thought process that it was related to the movie as the box implied. Be warned however that this is a complete falsehood, the most that this game has to do with the movie is that there is a horse that you can choose that is named Sonya. No racing, no healing back to health, nothing of the sort. On the other hand, the game was quite fun to play once I got over my dissapointment at being lied to. If you are interested in horses, or have a young child who is interested in horses then this could be the game for you. Great for young children, very easy to play."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZz,"This game is sooooooo boring! It takes forever to groom the horse and I'm not sure if it even tells you when you are done. I kept grooming and grooming and the horse was never completely clean. Also, in the beginning it was very confusing on how to start competing. I do not recommend this game when there are much better ones out there...I'm glad I got this for free!"
1,Grrr so boring,"I got this game for christmas and was really excited to play the film out in this game dreamer. Boy was i wrong. The game has nothing to do with the film at all. It has no real challange and is very easy do it. The graphics are horried and its really not worth the money at all. Im warning you if you are looking for something fun , this game is not it, personaly, i would try saddle up: time to ride, now theres a good game!"
4,This game is fun!,"I like this game but lets ride champion collection is better. lets ride dreamer is fun because you get to play dressage, jumping, crosscounry and free rideing. you also get to find a missing cat and a inhaler and aletter.there is a big dressage turnument and a big showjumping turnament. a girl bets that you cant beat record in cross country.You will probuly like this game."
4,It was O.K.,I was suprised you couldent race in this in this game because that is what the movie is about. A little dissapointing.
2,"It's okay, but sometimes gets boring....","The graphics are excellent on my labtop, but not on my XP. The show jumping is quite challenging. And its sometimes gets boring when you do the same thing each day. It is nothing like the movie.I liked it because there is a lot of horses to pick from. You can't make your horse look like Sonya because the color on the game is lighter than Sonya."
5,Yellowstone,"Very thorough description of trails. Chart of easy, moderate and strenuouos trails is helpful."
5,Great product and customer service!,The product was as described and arrived quickly. The instructions for reprogramming were easy to follow and worked the first time. The local dealership was going to charge me $80 for a remote and $100 to program it. The programming took less than 5 minutes. A great bargain!
5,Excellent un-biased source of Waffen-SS Information,"This book is a great overview of the divisions and commanders within those divisions, along with information of what exactly they did. My favorite part of this book is the misconception and myth section, because it sets the record straight in my opinion. Alot of the myths are what the majority of the public believe, I have even tried to explain these things to people, but they just dont get it. Even specials on the history channel seem biased,condemning and making deragatory remarks about certain people or events related to the Waffen-SS. But this book points out key facts, and why how the vast majority of people view the Waffen-SS, is wrong. But as they say, the winners of the war write the history books.I recommend this book to anyone who is open minded and willing to look at the Waffen-SS in a different light, contrary to the popular and misinformed beliefs of today."
5,Great Research Book.,"Ok, this is the last review until I finish a few more books.....anyone got any titles, LOLOK, I found this book really well done and to the point. I would say it is more along the research type of book, as it is NOT a memoir or not really a story.The chapters cover everything I would want to know about the SS. SS units, weapons used, Bio's on major characters (brief but with good information, and a good read). How the SS DIV were broken down and of course where the Divisions fought, and how they ended the war. One of the chapters covers all the countries that supplied volunteers to the German elite units and has a break down of wounded/killed and what happened to the soldiers at wars end. This is a really good read in my mind.Most of the photos have not been seen by me. I found myself going back to this book to re-read certain chapters to help explain other books. I know I will be using this book to compliment later books.Highly recommended as a research book."
5,Fantastic for Pear Nut Bread,I find these pears to be a high quality dried fruit. I love to substitute them for dried appricots in making nut breads. Dried pears are difficult to find in our local market and am happy to have found this source.
1,NON-EXISTENT BOOK!,"This book does not exist and never has existed. Suspect Thoughts Press had to file for bankruptcy and canceled the author's contract, and this book never went to print. The author was startled to even see this listed given the timing of the facts. She has tried repeatedly to get this listing removed in order to better serve her readers, but has encountered numerous difficulties with the Amazon.com listing process. The REAL book was published by Sizzler's Barbary Coast Editions this month! (June 2011)"
4,"""Knifty""","I purchased this product for my mother, a very experienced and creative knitter. She loved it! Found it exactly what she needed."
3,Not for children,"This was not an ABC Family movie. There was no profanity but it was not meant for a family. Most of the movie is ok but towards the end there are some inappropriate themes. It really doesn't have anything to do with Christmas, other than the two meet at Christmas time. If you are looking for a Christmas movie for your children, find another one."
3,"Is this really a ""family"" movie??","I just watched this movie on t.v. here in the UK and I think we must have seen an edited version, as I do not recall hearing the ""F"" word. I am surprised if this is what the original version is like however, as it was made for the ABC Family Channel!! It was entertaining enough and the two girls are lovely, but I am just wondering about what constitutes a ""family"" movie these days if this sort of language and a couple of suggestive scenes can qualify!!"
2,Where's the Christmas?,"I was so excited for a new movie to add to our Christmas collection... not anymore! Very little to do with Christmas and not that good of a storyline. I was very disappointed! Besides all of this... there were some pretty suggestive scenes... not something I would expect from a ""Family channel"" movie. Bottom line... did not like!"
1,Christmas in Boston,"I purchased Christmas in Boston and in the first 30 minutes they said the ""F"" word three times and the CEO of the company is having an affair. I turned it off and threw in the trash. If this is a family Christmas movie we are in touble. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,A Very Sweet Story,"This was a very sweet story about two couples who, despite innumerable mix-ups, still manage to fall in love. It had plenty of laugh-out-loud moments as well. I highly recommend this movie."
4,Love this,This is a great movie! I love it! It is a must have for anyone who loves christmas themed love stories. It's not as predictable as some of the other movies you see out there.
1,Sorry I bought it,"I do not recommend this movie and would not allow my children to watch it. Why do the movie industry think they have to add sex to movies to make it more appealing, when omitting it in a movie is far better for a family to watch. I am sorry I wasted my money on this movie."
5,Excellent Must Have read for women!,I found Susan Weed after suffering for over 6 painful months with a very painful breast cyst and took painkillers that didn't help me at all and after trying the hot Ginger Compresses for less than a week I was able to get off of the useless painkillers and get back to a normal life again! I am so thankful to this book for making me feel better. I liked the book so much I became a student of Susan's.A woman's breast health is her life and I thank you personally Susan for making me feel so much better. Truely a gift for sharing with others!
4,Susun Weed rocks,"I really enjoy Susun Weed's books and this was no exception. I find her style very down to earth and full of practical advice. However, I would not recommend this book to people who believe everything their allopathic doctor tells them."
3,"Decent quality, but not for everyone","This steering wheel cover is very simple and basic, but of very decent quality. It is easy to install, and it sits tightly on a steering wheel. My issue is that it is actually quite bulky and adds significant volume to the wheel grip, at least in my experience. So I actually ended up returning it back to Amazon. My conclusion is that those with smaller hands may really get a ""handful"" from this cover."
5,Steering wheel cover,"I bought this cover to install on a worn out steering wheel for a 98 BMW.The first attempt to install was difficult. It was like a small tire that wouldn't fit the rim.Somewhere I read that I could put it in the dryer for a few minutes to warm it up. After that, I was able toslip it on with a couple of flat opon ended wrenches for leverage. It looks and feels great. I'm really pleased."
5,Stearingwheel cover,Four hands and a shoehorn and this was a trick. It is very comfortable to hold and the feel of the leather is great.
4,Recommended,"Good quality, installation was simple. You will notice a more bulky feel when you grab the wheel. No tacky smell like the cheaper non leather products."
3,nice but overpriced,"It's a nice cover, but its overpriced ... Just go to your local auto parts store, they are much cheaper there"
1,Too Small!,"The steering wheel cover arrived, and I immediately went to my car to slide it on. Boy was I wrong. This thing DID NOT FIT at all. It was entirely too small for my Volvo's steering wheel, and was a huge waste of time. ""Slip on cover fits all standard steering wheels"" is a LIE!"
3,"nice feel, but just to thick!","Nice look & feel and easy to install, but it is just too bulky. After just a couple of days I removed this steering wheel cover."
5,Pilot Automotive SW-101 Genuine Black Leather,"Good product great hands on feel while driving, lessens the vibrations on the road, fits perfect on Jeep Wrangler steering wheel, highly recommended."
5,bought for 99 ford ranger,This was needed to cover a well worn steering wheel. It arrived fast and packaged well. Took the advice and tossed it in the dryer for about three minutes. Slid on easily....under a minute. Looks great.
2,too small for large steering wheels,"The description for this needs a size specification. The product itself comes with no instructions. If there is a way to get this on my truck's 15.5"" wide and somewhat thick steering wheel, I couldn't find it. I followed some of the suggestions made by other commenters on ways to stretch it on, but no luck. I also followed the suggestion of running it through the dryer for 20 minutes to make it more pliable, but only succeeded in burning my fingers.I'm only giving a second star because it does appear to be well made. On a smaller wheel, I might have been totally satisfied."
4,Good looking steeling wheel cover,"I has been using so many steeling wheel covers, but this is the best one that I got right now. I would recommend this to everyone."
4,Works as promised,The product is exactly as they describe it and the issues that others have mentioned. If those are ok I think it is great.
1,"Good construction, poor quality","Fast shipping as always via Amazon Prime. This steering wheel cover advertises it to be ""Genuine Leather"". I think that's a bit of an over statement. The one I received seemed like it was made from half leather and then half ""pleather"". The construction was very good and it seemed to be well made, but the quality of the leather used leaves a bit to be desired. The fit was perfect and if they had used a better quality of leather, I would have gave it a 5 star rating."
5,Great product,"Just received yesterday and cannot wait to install it. Need a little strength to install. Feel smooth, very comfortable! I highly recommend this product!"
5,Bulky but amazing!,"It makes the extremely comfortable. The leather is good quality, soft, adds a lot of bulk, but, again, so comfortable!"
3,Good but not good,"I bought this to cover up the steering wheel on my Honda Civic since it was starting to get wear spots. Amazon said it would fit and it did but it is too big. It keeps moving around and i feel it would cause an accident versus help. Additionally, it feels bulky and makes the steering wheel a lot thicker which makes it uncomfortable to drive with. I gave it 3 stars because it says it fits but in actuality it does not."
4,Did not specify the size of the item,"This steering wheel cover does not work for my nissan maxima. It does not fit!!! The steering wheel is a bit bigger than this wheel cover. Make sure you double check with the size or else you have to return it like I just did. Thus I have to minus 1 star.Other than this issue, the steering wheel is very well-made. The leather feels and looks real. Good quality and definitely awesome if it fits."
4,more for the female,The book is good...full of information for men. I'm still a little confused as to what i should do as a female to cultivate this energy. I feel i have to buy another book but which one?
3,"""The Lucy Show""","There are no opening or closing credits for any of the episodes.So this DVD is just a collection of scenes, one after the other non-stop.The back of the case has three photos of Lucy with Carol Burnett, but Carol Burnett is NOT featured in any of the episodes.Picture Quality: FAIRSound Quality: Good"
3,Not quite new...,"I was thrilled when I heard of the ""new"" Ida album but realized it was a sort of best of rather than a new album. While I do love the songs, it may disappoint a longtime fan of Ida. Some criticism I have read of this album pertains to the lack of continuity. It is simply because it is not a cohesive album and reflects the change in style and line up of the band over the years. While some of the songs are so fabulous they can make me cry, I was disappointed that it was not all new. There are some new songs on the album and either way, I am still glad I bought it. I just thought I would warn those of you looking for a truly new Ida album."
3,Decentish,"""Will You Find Me"" sounds exactly like you'd expect it to sound. People who like Ida will like it, and people who don't will not; this isn't exactly intellectual fare. A lot of the songs, like ""Maybelle"" and ""Georgia"", are awesome and, while not surprising, more-or-less what one would expect from a good Ida release. More than half of the the others, particularly ""Shotgun"" and ""Down on Your Back"" make me picture four aging scenesters wringing their hands and trying to write, you know, ""some Ida songs."""
4,Typically terrific album.,"Ida is a band that has talent and passion in spades. Their eagerly anticipated new album does not disappoint. It runs out of steam a bit (just a tiny, tiny bit) by the end, but is still a most worthy purchase. Highlights (so far) are ""Maybelle,"" ""Shrug"" and ""Man in Mind."" Enjoy!"
3,How Bugs Bunny Won The West,"I really like the cartoons,but since I have seen the originals I knew that these were NOT uncut! I am disappointed also because I could do without Denver Pyle as Narrator.Its not bad for the price,even though its only 24 minutes long."
5,America,"Awesome live album. Just had the privilege of seeing America play in Australia. They just get better with age. I always feel very nostalgic when listening to some of their hits, memories of a great time."
4,Naming the Nameless and Saving a World,"Mike Reed has suffered tragically and walks through life numb like a man walking away from an accident in Johnson's novel. About to lose anything significant to him, Reed harrows his own hell and follows his own version of Beatrice in Flower Cannon. Johnson's work deftly portrays Mike's depths as he works through the loss of his wife and daughter while Johnson gently parodies both academia and middle-class existence. When Mike hears ""the word,"" Johnson not only creates a sympathetic character, but has brought the reader along for a revelation. A smoothly written and seductively complex work."
2,Language by itself is not a novel,"My first Denis Johnson, and maybe not my last. But on the strength of this, it seems his specialty is elaborately cut paper dolls and snowflakes. The premise of the deaths the narrator has taken so long now to get used to is all right. Songs on the Death of Children is a great work by Mahler, after all. But Johnson's song, or rather his narrator's, is only another dose of Richard Ford's Wounded American Man. Across the river and very deep into the trees, I am afraid. Ghosts of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and others abound as well, including Robert Stone, but Stone's inventions are often startling. Johnson's vision of stoic hurting is not enough to make the novel fine. He should have put it away, as a sketch for something larger and more... operatic."
2,Like a torture that I didn't notice,"It took me months to finish this book. Not because I'd pause to ponder or want to let an emotion roll through me but because I could find nothing valuable in the book. And I looked.It follows a flat, emotionally shallow protagonist supplemented by a stereotyped, ""typical male fantasy"" female and underdeveloped relationships, even with the wife & child he professes to mourn. It is a book bulging with symbolism but no significance - a type of literary masturbation that leads to nothing but the release of the author. Deeply disappointing."
5,Denis The Menace Strikes Again,"What to say? Another great chapter of the greatest american novel in progress. Read it in couple of hours and feels like a whole life. Thank you, Johnson."
1,Weak,Old geezer gets revitalized by ''encounter'' with young attractive woman and a new BMW. At 6 pages/dollar you can do a lot better with your money.
2,Short and bittersweet,"This novel/novella is a very short work (143 pages) but reads like a tweener ( a too long, short story or a novel that didn't quite develope). The work would be a great 70 pager with some cuts. The author does not develop the story as he does in his other work. He seems to meander trying to get his point of an obsession of a professor for a college girl, while feeling sorrow and guilt for his deceased family."
3,Too much white,"Here's the source: I'm a big Denis Johnson fan. If I had read his stuff during puberty, I would probably be gay and stalking him right now. Hope that's not offensive.It's not a bad book, but in my opinion it's the worst Denis Johnson book. It read like a draft that had been bleached. The desperation, emptiness, and desolation aren't counterbalanced by unbelievable metaphors and very-believable grit as well as they are in his other works. The characters and plot have quirks and purpose, but they're missing connective tissue between the two. And pay attention during the prolonged, fade-out ending, lest you try to read the blank pages after the text ends...There were a couple of subtly beautiful moments, but I agree with the reviewer who recommended Jesus' Son. I would also recommend Angels and, if you like or could like poetry, The Incognito Lounge (which is in ""The Throne of the..."" etc collection). It would be a shame if you dismissed Johnson because you read this book first."
1,I can't believe this woman!,"Nancy Krulik obviously has way too much time on her hands! Not only did her first book (or, as I like to say, her first attempt at exploiting Leo and quickly cashing in on his success) leave us stunned by the numerous and excessive amount of mistake in fact, she had to write another one! This one is just as awful, giving us ""pop quiz"" (hence the title) questions to test our Dicaprio knowledge. Personally, I think that her knowledge should be tested, because, true to form, she makes numerous mistakes about his life."
2,Not what I expected,"I had hoped for some insight about what to do, what to see in this area prior to a visit. This video is basically a helmet-cam view of a bumpy bike ride. No narrative, no ID of anything. Maybe 30 minutes long. It didn't expand my knowledge of this area, so it wasn't worth the money for me."
4,Display,"I got a fairly sophisticated display in the hopes that my poor vision would be aided by it. Wrong! The monchrome display and its hue are not helpful. Full color of course would be better, but; perhaps a different shade of monochrome would be easier to see."
4,is ok,"For begineers , explain so good is slow and easy to follow I like itand for sure buy the next dvd , come on time"
2,Ok but not great,"I am pretty new to Tai Chi so I have watched only a few intro dvd's so far. I can just say that most other Intro's are more interesting, made me feel better, and made me feel like I got a lot more out of them. Best person is Christopher Pei, but this fell way way short."
2,Seen better!,Not a program I would use myself or with my students. Easy to follow. Perhaps it would be good for a basic intro.
4,Nice variety of relaxing workouts,I am a beginner with Tai Chi. The verbal instructions as well as the movements of the models are easier to follow along with than other Tai Chi videos I have tried in the past. The music and setting add to the sense of calm. There is variety with five different workouts available. I enjoy these peaceful workouts and find the short sessions to be a refreshing break in my day.
3,Okay but could be better,"Nice, well produced video. But I find it a bit lacking from an instructional standpoint. For example, the instructor doesn't explain the breathing until you've been doing a move several times."
3,Not what I thought,I own several Tai Chi dvds and am always looking for ways to change up my practice. This dvd was lacking in so many areas- it did not flow and the practitioners did not engage me the way I was used to. This was not for me but it does deliver what it says it does- 5 different Tai Chi based workouts.
3,Not what I thought,"I love Dr. Brazelton and have for years. However, this book was very disappointing. Luckily, I picked it up from my local library before I purchased it on here. It states a lot of facts about the ""how and why"" children act out, but it is VERY short on solutions. The book is ""all over the place"" and not logically organized. There are a few places where the same suggestion is repeated numerous times. My suggestion is to pick it up from the library...it's a quick read...and see if it helps your situation. I can say that the section on biting seemed extremely informative, but that was not an issue with my child."
2,A Poor Follow to the original work,"While this volume promises to help the Periodization trainee to design a workable program, it offers little if anything more than the original work on Periodization provided.I've used the aforesaid volume to help with resistance training that I've done for most of my athletic life (fifty years of weight training to provide the muscle for Judo, karate, whitewater kayaking, marathon swimming and mountain biking. I was looking for something more than what this volume offers and found that the authors apparently gave their all in the original work on Periodization."
3,Scientists only,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is highly advanced, and not for beginners. It contains absolutely everything that has ever been studied on the subject. However, even for the seasoned trainer, it is hard to find what you are looking for, and even harder to understand. There are so many references and technical terms that the essence of what it is saying is almost lost. If it was written in English, and organised into a logical manner, it would be far more useful. The tables are very difficult to read. A gap still exists for a book containing all this information in plain English. It would be half the size and much more readable."
5,An Excellent book of Resistance Training,I just finished this book and have put together what I feel to be an awesome exercise prescription based on the information from the book. It is really a text book on the subject but in no way is it incomprehensible. I thought the entire book had a good flow to it and very detailed. The essence of the book is that workout design must be designed in phases meaning periods of heavy weights low reps with periods of light weight and high reps. I especially liked the information on Isometrics which the book goes into with much detail. This is the best book on resistance I have ever read.
2,Not what I expected,"Book should be titled something else. Lots of science but very little info re: designing programs. I was looking for program design not to re-learn types of muscle contraction or the chemistry of a contraction. If you are looking to learn about designing cycles of training, its not found here."
5,Discipline and Range,"It is true that many books have what, in Iowa and elsewhere, are called ""themes."" But (in deference to Ms. Jones) perhaps things are different in Houston.Nevertheless, the tonal range of Harvey's book is its chief pleasure - from the playful ""The Need for Consistency"" to the raging heaven and hell of ""Frederick Courteney Selous's Letters to His Love"" to the visionary solemnity of ""Translation."" Anyone reading without the blindfold of personal resentment will be able to appreciate Harvey's always precise and often beautiful lines. An impressive debut. I recommend this book highly."
1,It's a Debut; Give Her a Break Readers...,"Like most debut books, Pity the Bathtub is full of flaws. but it has some beautiful moments that cast the reader in to that place where we all feel in the presence of a true artist struggling to communicate between all that separates them and the rest of us. This writer's second book will be better. I know this."
2,Now This One Just the Same...,"I have such trouble with the poetry of this latest generation: the poetry seems just like prose chopped up into lines, randomly. Obviously there is a difference however. Yet I don't see it here. I see a lot of vast imaginatory work, but the self-possession of the speaker or narrator, whomever this young girl is, is just too distracting for me to care about the poems themselves."
5,great watch,"i got this as a gift, and it turned out to be a really good watch. its really thin(which i love), so if you like the big bulky watches, you might want to stay away from this. also, the little rectangle that displays the date at the 6 o clock mark is a small. other than that, its a great watch."
1,"This camera is NOT ""Plug and Play""!!!","The ad said it connects right into your computer...this is NOT TRUE!!!! The description is MISLEADING. You will need to buy an extra connector for $49 (from them, of course). Also, the camera does not come with directions or any software - and if you have a MAC it will never be compatible. When I asked about returning it they refused to pay for the shipping costs - even though they had misleading information in their description. That's bad business practice. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this company."
1,not for surveillance!!,"This camera is NOT for surveillance. Images are projected on tv screen, which means that if you are not at home, with the tv on you cannot keep track of what's happening. What's the use of it anyway? When I read Product Details I thought I could use it to spy the nanny."
4,OK little camera,"I purchaced this camera and received it the next day, it works fine and has crystal clear reception, it did not come with the little bnc rca adapters as pictured wich was really not a concern to me because my security system by Zmodo ( also purchaced from Amazon) uses the bnc cables as well. I hooked it up and it works great."
1,Missing parts,"Well it arrived on time but missing the adapters to hook it up to our TV so we can't even test it. I'm bumming because I've bought several cheap spy cameras. So this one I really was hoping to get it up and running.I tried getting them to send the connectors, not sure there proper name.Any ideas?.........Will update in future......."
1,almost worthless,"This book is practically useless for anybody who actually needs to do financial analysis and forecasting at work. 90% of us use spreadsheets for financial analysis and forecasting, and we end up working with complex spreadsheets which tie everything from complex sales forecasts to income statements to balance sheets to cash flow projections. I am still looking for an appropriate book and/or spreadsheet add-ons that will allow me to do this. I have been searching in vain for such a program and/or book. Does anybody know?"
1,"Zero stars, if I could!","I don't know what kind of needles this thing takes but it doesn't take standard ball inflation needles. The package has German text so maybe there's some European needle that fits this pump. It doesn't even take the needles Amazon advertises with it! As it is, this pump is useless."
3,ok action flick,Ok story line. Lacked development of main character. I would have liked to seen the story evolve more around the child. could have developed more of an angle on the mafias as well.
4,safe,RSafe [Blu-ray + Digital Copy]I just bought thisThis is a good movie. But I did expect a little more it.
3,It's Jason Statham,"It had great fight scenes, lot's of action and a decent story line to follow. It was a little less predictable than some of his other movies which was good but let's be realistic we watch these movies to see him kick ass, and it delivered."
4,"Great action, far out plot.","I saw this recently on Blu Ray. I like Jason Statham and I like this kind of action movie. The movie delivers on almost all levels, except you have to leave your brain at the door a little bit. Acting was quite good, action scenes were terrific. The chemistry between Jason and the little girl was very good. The plot contrivances were numerous and pretty far fetched, that's my only knock on the film. Most of the scenes were shot at night, so it's not going to show off your home theater much. Definitely worth a rental for action fans."
4,Safe,"Good movie, fast paced, time flies. Jason always puts on a good show. Have told many friends to watch the movie with some popcorn."
3,same old same old,It was just like all of Jason Statham movies. I have seen him in better. Don't get me wrong its pretty good just not great
2,action,Lots of action to say the least. I like the ending but that poor girl is going to need soo much therapy!
2,actionman,did not like the film seems Statham is loosing his action packed films he must be getting like Van Damn & Seagal made the money so now just think showing face & name will make it.
1,"violent, bad acting",I can't think of one good thing to say about this movie. Definately not worth the rental fee or my time.
1,Lots of action but no storyline; writing just gets worse and worse towards ending.,Lots of action but no storyline; writing just gets worse and worse towards ending. Wasted 90 minutes on this flick.
2,Okay,"Not ""A"" number one but, okay for action...somewhat decent in plot...Not a Lot of replay value here mates...so so...sos so..."
1,Awful,"I'm a Jason Statham fan so I had fairly high expectations for this movie, but it turned out to be absolutely moronic. Nothing about it - not the plot, characters or action sequence, had a shred of believability to it. It was almost like someone made a farce of an action movie. I absolutely, positively do not recommend this movie."
1,I Give Up,"I used to enjoy Jason Statham's films (example: ""War"",""Crank"",""Transporter series"") but as of late he has become the Nic Cage of bad action films....""Safe"" is the newest edition in the terrible Statham movie catalog. Avoid this one."
1,Error,"Am sure its a good movie, love Statham..After purchasing this movie on prime.We tried playing but got.. Error not able to play at this time..."
4,When your brain needs a nap...,Jason Statham is the definition of action entertainment. While the story is not complex it is fast paced with fun action and plenty of Statham attitude. Always fun.
4,Overall Good Movie - Worth the Rental,"A lot of action and violence, but overall an above average movie. I do not recall this movie in theaters but I am glad I found it here. The story line was different, and well written. I know Jason Statham would probably like to do something other that action movies, but this is his wheel-house, and he is very good at it. It was worth the rental."
4,Rent this!,"Everything you love about Jason Statham plus interesting characters, fast-moving storyline, and butt-kicking on par with Jackie Chan. Lots of fun!"
4,Stratham is simply hot,"The movie was okay but I expected just a bit more of an emotional storyline. The action was great...the stunts and phrases threw a great punch, however it didn't beg that I needed to watch it again."
4,Not getting paid for my reviews.,"Not getting paid for my reviews, but I would watch movie again. I like action movies. Not getting paid for my reviews."
3,Jason Statham has done better,"I generally like Jason Statham movies so I'm going to with a lackluster script on the mediocre review. Jason may not have much more time for these type of action movies, hope he isn't relegated to low-level scripts. Love the Chinese mob boss, adds campiness to the evil."
4,Safe Rocks it,The plot may be a little thin but Statham does a great job as a marked man who risks his life to save a child. Some pretty good plot twists and awesome action. The little girl pretty much steals the show.
3,Mediocre,"The movie was very short in length and in substance but, really good on action sequences!!! The story was really lacking and it had too many sub titles and they flashed on the screen too quickly!!!"
3,entertaining action movie,"Well, this was an entertaining action movie, like a million others. Have seen many worse ones though. Had a bit of catching meaning to it!"
2,Safe is not one of Jason's best,"I ordinarily love any movie with Jason Statham in it, but this one was confusing, seemed to have nonesensical action in it, and the acting was rather poor. Transporter was much better."
2,Mediocre at Best,Imagine what this movie is like. Yep. That's what it's like. Jason Statham has done a lot of these types of films. This one is forgettable.
3,Safe,"It was a well made movie, but got too complicated when every criminal from different countries started chasing a little math wizard girl. It was still interesting to watch though!"
5,Jason Rules!,Jason Statham is still one of the best action stars around despite his age. This has been one of his best films with some great fight scenes. Would love to see a sequel.
5,Great action movie!,Statham almost always great is this type of movie. Never miss him. I very seldom buy a DVD made an exception for this one.
3,kinda lame,This is just pure Statam action with a weak plot that just leads to gratuitious violence. Would not waste my money on it
4,"great movie if you are a fan of Statham's fighting technique. The plot was OK, but the action scenes were awesome!","Great movie if you are a fan of Statham's fighting technique. The plot was light, but the action scene's were awesome!"
3,Good Action Movie,"This is a good action movie. It starts off slow because they are setting up the story but once the action starts it doesn't stop. The one complaint that I have is having to read the dialog when the chinese or russians are talking. If I had wanted a foreign film to read the dialog, I would have purchased a foreign film."
4,great action,You can count on Jason to give a great performance and he comes through in this case as well. Action packed and never a dull moment either.
5,Movie.,The movie was delivered on time and I did manage to watch it. I thought it was a great movie and I enjoyed it very much.Larry
4,Great Action Flix,Very good action movie with a very good plot. The fights were very well staged and the little girl was cute. I always like my bad guys over the top and all of these were. Jason Statham is the best action star in fights that we have in todays movies. I would recommend this movie to every one. Get your popcorn out.
3,"Jason Statham, need I say more....","Probably will not be nominated for any movie awards, but hey you got action, good guys, bad buys, and a somewhat believable plot. As always Mr. Statham plays his part to the hilt, the man can fight that's for sure. This is a movie for anyone that likes action, and just want's to see some bad guys get what they deserve."
5,Liked it!,"This movie held my interest, of course I like Jason and I like action. The story line was good. It was clean and had good follow though. I will want to watch it again so will probably buy it"
4,Surprisingly awesome action flick,"This latest from international action star Jason Statham would appear to be just another Statham-esque movie. The guy does seem to be frequently typecast, but regardless one cannot doubt he is a very entertaining action hero. While the movie may appear to be just another Transporter wannabe, it actually is highly entertaining and a refreshing story to boot. Movies like this must be watched on Blu-ray, of course.Source: criticnic.com 11-September-2012Disclosure: Film sent by Lionsgate"
4,Action packed,I like Jason Statham action packed movies. Safe wont disappoint you if you are a fan of Mr.Statham and like action movies. I enjoyed from start to end of the move.
4,A Good movie.,"Very Good action movie. not His best; I think Expendables 2 is better action &,The Mechanic a better story; I still like him in The Italian Job as well!It is a good movie and well worth watching."
4,Overall a crowd pleaser and much better than the previews!,Jason Statham is a favorite actor of mine and when I checked out the previews for this one I was skeptical at first. They just don't do the movie justice. I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed this movie. Action packed - this one will keep you entertained.
3,Worth watching...,"If you like action flicks, this one is worth watching it. Good fighting scenes, decent plot, bad acting (as expected from a movie with Jason Statham)."
4,Got Statham?,"I like Jason Statham. Not his best movie, but if you like to see bad guys get wasted, this one ROCKS! Not recommended for liberal Dems or tree huggers."
2,Jason Statham & others,"The plot is weak or lame.The Statham's lines are terrible.Fight scenes are OK, but not the best he's done.My suggestion: rent something else."
5,Jason delivers again,"If you're in the mood for a nice action flick, this is a good place to start. Jason Statham has been on a roll with action films that are just a lot adrenaline pumping fun to watch, and this movie is no exception."
3,"Jason Stratham doing the tough ""good guy"".","Jason Stratham does a good job pulling the plot along. Unfortunately, its a bit difficult to believe. The Asian girl's character is weak. Not her acting, just the character. Since the whole movie is based on her, I found it just entertaining enough to watch all the way through. Though, it is unlikely a movie I would watch a 2nd time."
4,Safe with Jason Statham,Typical but quality Statham action with good storyline and enjoyable performance by the young Asian actress Catherine Chan. A sleeper that was surprisingly entertaining.
5,"One of the best gun fights ever, lots of action, excellent extra features","An enjoyable, fun movie for a good break from real life. I saw this in the theater and wanted to see it a second time - and more. The little girl is cute as can be and the bad guys, convincingly bad.The gun handling was excellent, (be sure to watch this action over and over and you'll see something new each time) but that's expected from the 87 Eleven and their capable boss, Chad Stahelski.What really makes the DVD worth the price is the extra features. Very good commentary and entertaining and informative 'make of' bonus features. Not to be missed."
2,Bad Acting and Under-Developed Story,"Safe contains elements of a typical Jason Statham vehicle; action shots, fight scenes, yelling, and punchy one-liners. Typically, this formula works rather well. In the case of Safe, sadly, it doesn't work at all. The film runs a little over an hour and a half, leaving absolutely no time for plot or character development. The tone is frenetic and rushed. There are some cool action scenes to be had but for the most part, the movie is over-produced and under-acted, and the score is utterly dreadful. Mix in some pretty bad dialogue and you have a recipe for a disappointing movie experience."
4,another great fast paced movie,"I found this movie to be a fast paced movie like most of Jason Statham's movies are. Had a good storyline and interesting mainn characters, but be prepared to do some reading as there are more subtitles as the main characters are in china and speek their language."
5,Great character depth,"Luke used to be a cop until he discovered the corruption around him. He left the force to pursue cagefighting. But then a fixed fight went horribly wrong landing his opponent in ICU. Luke became a marked man.He rushed home to whisk his wife away, but the Russian mob got to her first. They warned him that anyone he talked to were also marked. Depressed, he contemplates suicide on the edge of the subway until he sees a scared little girl out of the corner of his eye.Mei has a knack for numbers. She is discovered by the Triads and used to memorize a code. The Russian mob tries to kidnap her but Mei manages to escape everyone and tries to disappear into the subway.Safe has a great storyline with good twists and well developed characters. I think they did an especially good job of showing the contrast between how Luke interacted with the dirty cops and mobsters and how he interacted with Mei."
3,"Same old, same old","This is not a bad movie if you like Jason Statham. It is a run of the mill action flick that plays out like every other action movie Jason Statham has been in. At times, it felt like I was watching The Transporter 4. I think it is time for Statham to find another character to play."
4,cool,"cool stratum always gritty actor isn't requiring twenty more words is foolish it's a quick review not a critique, really?"
4,"Status quo for Jason Statham, good action, one liners...an entertaining film","A fun fast paced movie typical of Jason Statham. If you have seen his other films, you won't be disappointed."
4,Like Transporter,The preview accurately represents the movie. It made the time go by on the plane. Watching it once was enough.
5,Great action movie,Another great movie with Jason Statham. He continues to not let me down with his choices of scripts. Well worth the watching.
3,Safe Jason Statham,"This product arrived on time, and there were no defects or cracks in the DVD. The picture was also very clear, and there was no skipping in the move to other tracks."
1,BEWARE - - Picture is NOT what you receive.,"I looked at the picture and thought I was getting shuffle board sticks/poles/cues AND discs. When the package arrived it was ONLY the 8 discs! When I went back to the ad, it noticed it only says ""discs"" but I was confused by the photo and the word ""set"" (assuming it meant a ""SET"" of sticks/poles/cues and discs). I would never have spent nearly $80 just for the discs alone."
4,Rising Force Book,"This is a great book. Its a great way to pick up Yngwie's picking and sweeping style. Great exercises for more dexterity as well. The material in it is hard, so I recommend you buy ""Speed Mechanics"" by Troy Stetina, before you try Yngwie's stuff. Have fun."
3,Off the beaten path,"This guy isn't (and wasn't, obviously) for the masses. After seeing him open for both Cream and The Stones back in the 60s I became addicted to both ""Bang, Bang"" and ""Superlungs"" lps and found his scratchy, give it all you got every time voice to be powerful and enjoyable. The dude got plenty of exposure as an opening act but that live excitement just never crossed over to the charts with the sparse productions of his songs on vinyl. As talented as little Terry was, he just didn't have ""it"" (whatever that intangible but elusive personality characteristic may be). But it sure wasn't from lack of effort on his part."
4,Alien 3- not bad..,"A good fast moving action game. Other than the aliens themselves the game dosen't follow the movie at all, but its a good game. You must travel throught a ship saving people before the time runs out, or they die and you loose. It can be hard at times and slightly frusturating but overall its a good game."
3,"okay, but not great","I really liked the projects in this book, but that is because I have seen the results in so many other books and magazines. For example, in every decorating book there seems to be a project on how to create decorative screens. Furthermore, although they are nice projects, it may take an expert craftsman and seamstress to do them, if the intructions in the book are followed. Also, for a book that is suppose to be a general one on decorating, very few styles are represented. On the plus side, the author does cover the basics and the photos are decent.Recommendation:Mr. Lee has other books on decoration, so if you like those you might like this one. However, for everyone else, there are other books that are more ""essential"" for your collection than this one."
5,SCARY AS CRAP SPIDER! EVEN CUTER SAM AND FRODO!!,"When I opened the box I literally crapped a brick. The spider is that scary! Its eyes beam out at you and its whole being exudes pure evil. The hobbits are very cute and lovable. You can easily imagine Sam yelling, ""Get away, you filth!"" Excellent toy!"
5,Opened my heart!,"I really love this CD. One of my favorites. I am quite familiar with this work and it is a very useful tool. The music and gentle guidance of Dr Berlin gets you into a comfortable space of exploration. Even with no experience in meditation or imagery, you will be able to fall right into your quest. THis guided visualization really helped me to center in on what i needed to deal with within myself. It truly was a transformational experience and continues to be as i keep working with it."
3,Great Content for those sick of Religion and churchianity!!!,"While the book was not written with continuity and clarity, I absolutely agree with the focus of his point. Churchianity and vain religion is a disgust in the sight of God. Oftentimes program based church structure lends towards that. A cell group based church has potential for the Holy and Mighty Spirit of God to be unleashed. There are dangers in that, but it is worth it regardless."
4,Another Hit for Caeser,"I am a big fan of the Dog Whisper Series. This DVD arrived within the stated time and played without any problem. The only disappointing thing is the spitting of the season into 2 volumes. It seems as if we should have received twice the number of episodes as previous seasons, since we had to pay twice the price."
4,Dog Whisperer Season 4 Vol2,"I enjoyed this season very much, it has much the same stories & results as the previous seasons but there are a couple of ""gems"" in this season, you'll have to purchase the DVDs to find them."
3,Child's glove,Too smallIt fits like a childs glove and the fits starts almost at the center of your palm.
4,does the job,"sometimes weights slip b/c the gloves slip off, but for the most part, it works well at protecting my hands and enhancing my grip."
2,Cheaply made.,I just got it today and one of my gloves has a loose thread and there is a hole where the fabric and the band that goes around your wrist meet. Pretty crappy material. Not impressed at all.
3,Only OK for me,"Overall these gloves provide decent hand protection, and have allowed my calluses to go away. Here are my complaints though: 1)fit - I checked the company's sizing chart and ordered a medium. While the palm size is decent, I found the fingers and wrist to be too loose - which means they slide more than I'd like. 2)Length - I personally would have liked the fingers to be a little longer. It would have been nice if they at least reached up to the first knuckle (I have short fingers too). Plus, since the fingers are loose on me, they slide down and cover even less so my fingers barely have any protection at all. That can get uncomfortable for me since my weights have a textured grip which rubs more than a smooth surface would. The only way to compensate is to try and pull the glove up, but that doesn't really work too well. Overall these are a decent pair of gloves. For me though, I think there is probably a better pair out there."
2,Poor quality,"I received them with two small holes both on the same glove - one between the index and middle fingers and the other between the ring finger and pinky. Upon the first use, the white stitching on the thumb pad unraveled."
1,A Rip Off,"The description of these gloves sounded perfect for my needs. I ordered small based on the size of the pair that I've been using for a few years from the same manufacturer. However, the new ones are too tight, come up to high over the knuckles, and more important, the left glove came ripped at a seam between the thumb and pointing finger. I am 5'2"", 115 lbs. and small-framed. C'mon! A size small should not be too tight and the fabric and construction should not be dollar store quality. Next time, I'll take the time to go to Dick's Sporting to try on and check out the quality first hand."
4,decent workout gloves for the price,"kind of cheap construction, but they work well and have lasted about 4 months. i got the size small and it is pretty true to size."
3,Fit like a glove,"I bought these gloves because I started working out at the gym and needed added protection to my hands, since I have carpal tunnel. These gloves protect my palms from the pressure and I have less pain in my hands. I wish the fit was tighter around the fingers, but ince I wear rings, the fit works out so I don't have to take my rings off; and I'm now wondering if I should got a glove to fit up around my wrist for added support. My hands are med-large and I have long skinny fingers, so the fit isn't custom made, but for now they're working out for my workout routine."
5,Good for workouts!,I got these to do kettle bell workouts with. They do a great job of protecting my hands from callouses and blisters!
4,I like it,I like this gloves I use at least 5 days a week . They run a little small and they need to come in pink or add pink to the black gloves
3,Works goood,Wish the sizing information was better! I should have bought the small instead of the medium. I don't like that it doesn't have some Velcro to tighten the glove on your hand.
3,good for 2 months max,I didn't buy these off amazon but they were amazing at first but started to leak a black stain onto my clothes. They also have a bad leathery smell that no matter what soak or washing detergent I use will remove. I think I bought them early July and they lasted til the beginning of September. If you wash them with anything else they will stain or if soaken the water is ink black within an hour.
3,Nice gloves,"I am happy with these so far, they are nice quality and comfortable. My only concern is that I wear them while doing floor work (push ups, etc) and one seam is starting to rip! Time will tell..."
2,A little disappointed,"When I got the gloves they were great, the fit perfectly as I have small hands. I used them at the gym 3 times a week for about 2-3 hours a day. However after about a month or so of use I have found that the cushioning for my fingers has disintegrated and it has become uncomfortable to use.I don't like holding weights and handles with my bare hands so I continue to use them but I'll be buying new gloves again soon. I think these are more suited for people who don't do much weight lifting etc"
4,Like,"I previously purchased these in Medium and they were truly uncomfortable.Small was the right size for me - a little snug, but they stretch with wear. Nice support, well made gloves.If you are looking for lightweight, breathable, gloves, these are not it.I use them with iron kettlebells and old-style Bowflex weights (at 20 lbs, they leave Bowflex imprints on my palms)Using 3-4 times a week, 3-4 month, still in great shape. HTH!"
4,Harbinger gloves,"The quality of the gloves is good. My old pair were a size small and the fingers were too big so I ordered these in an extra small to get a tighter fit...but they are ""child sized"". You also need to have a small palm if you order the extra small. I still get them on though!"
2,few pictures of cakes,"I returned this book. I like to see pictures of what I'm making and this had very few. I agree the other reviewers that this is not for the novice. I looked through every recipe, and I didn't see many recipes at all that I wanted to make."
5,Learning Nick Malgieri,Who can go wrong with a Nick Malgieri book in your kitchen?The book is written with the recipes being highlighted so you don't have to look for them on the page; I have only tried a few at this time but this may very well be the cookbook I will actually try to bake all of the recipes just to see which one(s) I will like to use forever.
4,Fantastic Recipes,"As for recipes, the ones I have tried turned out absolutely fantastic! I made the 'Orange Sponge Cake' last week and it was extremely light and fluffy, and the flavor was outstanding. I made the 'Lemon Meringue Cake' today and my co-workers are raving about it. I'm going to make it for an upcoming bridal shower - it turned out beautfully.However, I have to agree with the first reviewer 'oktober31' on the lack of some details in the instructions. I had to rely on my past experiences for things like 'how much to whip the meringue?', and 'should the eggs be at room temp or cold?', etc.These seem like small details, but when it comes to baking, we all know how important these small details become!But if you're a somewhat experienced baker, I highly recommend the book as the recipes are out of this world! - thanks"
4,some recipes are for experts only,I tried his chocolate souffle roll. I know that folding melted chocolate in egg whites is no childs play but I expected a chef of his level of expertise to give better tips. The cake went poof on me. I couldn't roll the souffle !! but it tasted so good that i served it anyway. Thats the good thing about chocolate.i tried his blueberry cake...yum.
5,Very Satisfied,"My daughter bought this clock for me in San Francisco at a small shop selling arts and things.It cost her more than $100 about 5 years ago.I love this clock, it worked flawlessly for more than 5 years and it looks cool!!"
2,First Steps,"The review from France could be misleading to neophytes as it might give the impression that this CD is a comprehensive overview of the career of this band, which is far from true. Steeleye Span has existed, with several line-up changes, for over 30 years, not 20. One of, if not THE most important change(s) occurred after the material on this compilation was released, with the arrival of Bob Johnson on guitar and Rick Kemp on bass, both of whom came from a rock background. From 1972`s Below the Salt onwards, the band`s sound was to vary from album to album, and the period from 1972 to 1976 was to be the most commercially successful, with the band developing a more rock-orientated style.""First Steps"" is a compilation from only a very brief time period in Steeleye`s history. There are around 20-odd original Steeleye Span albums in existence and this collection contains tracks from only three, the first(as the title would suggest)three."
4,"Good fun and patriotism, even if not very realisitic.","Like most military movies, this movie is not very realistic but it is a lot of fun. I grew up on a SAC base during the cold war and it could be very exciting at times. So this movie is pretty nostaligic to me. The movie is from 1963 and, all in all, that was a pretty good, exciting and fun time to be an American. The scene with the B52's taking off, makes it a must see all by itself, yet there is much more. If you recognize a lot of technical errors you just have to forget them and enjoy. This movie is corny but it has pizazz."
5,"A Beautiful, Rich and Diverse Collection","The depth and richness of this collection emerges, not only from Luci Shaw's great talent and creativity but also, from the scope of the years over which the collection was birthed. It is easy to imagine each year bringing new insights that reflect her context, spiritual growth and discoveries--coming to life in a poem for Christmas and for life. A lovely collection from simple yet profound word pictures to deep and complex ponderings. Each to be savored."
5,Tracy's back,"I think this is one of the best album releases I've heard in quite a while. Tracy's voice is strong as is the material. I do have to say that the first listen, left me wanting more, but as I took a more a concentrated listen the second time around, I found the material to be well written and very well arranged. I think any fan of country music or Tracy Lawrence will be happy with this release. My only wish is that Tracy had some original material on this release as is a very gifted songwriter."
4,Tracy's Done it Again,"I've been a Tracy fan ever since he made his albums in the beginning like Alibis and Sticks and Stones. I bought this CD yesterday, and I've listened to it all the way through. My CD player still hasn't stopped playing it, and I'm very pleased with each song on this CD. Each song on the CD is a song I can relate to, and he has such a unique voice. There will never be another Tracy, and I hope he keeps producing music for a long time to come. Even though his music isn't at the top of the charts (as I feel it should be), it is still some of the best music I have heard in quite some time. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to country music."
4,love this but how many songs,"I ordered this from amazon.com and have listened to it atleast 3 times all the way thourgh and paint me a brighemham many more then that. I have one problem though it is listed here as having 16 tracks my cd only has 12 and clocks in at around 47 minutes. Could someone tell me if they produced more then one version, as good as the cd is it would be even better with the four extra tracks."
1,strong like the smell of manure,i have every one of tracy lawrence cds this one stinkstracy should listen to some of his old cds and take some lessons from them
4,Tracy Lawrence,"I'm not surprised that this long awaited album is great. I have always loved his voice and think he's an incredible artist. I enjoy the entire album but ""Paint Me A Birmingham"" is still my favorite, for now at least."
4,Good CD from a good country artist,"I first heard Tracy when I was a Senior in high school, and I was really blown away, in fact he was one of the artists that made me like country music. His music has a nice country flavor while throwing in a bit of blues sound for good measure, and the latest CD is no exception. I heard PMAB on an Internet radio station and was hooked even after 10 years. I picked up the CD and really like it. I saw him a few years back live and got to shake his hand (he does a nice job connecting with the audience during the concerts). Tracks #4,5, and 9 stand out. Worth adding to a music collection of any sort."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,this cd is absolutely wonderful!! all the songs are awesome. Some of the songs i can really relate to! KEEP THE AWESOME SONGS COMING TRACY!
5,spends a lot of time in the CD player,"I find the departure from the jazzier style refreshing for a Carpenter's CD. I love the production on ""I want you back in my life again"". OK, it's pure pop, but there's no pretense that it is anything but. Pure zeal and that beautiful layered vocal climax. Other highlights ""When you got what it takes"" ""I believe you"" and ""Touch me when we're dancing""."
4,An unfortunate finale,"As a Carpenters fan, I enjoyed this album.. It contains some upbeat selections (such as the cover of ""Beechwood"" and ""Those Good Old Dreams""), as well as some wonderfully romantic numbers (such as ""Touch Me When We're Dancing"" and ""Because We Are In Love""). The Carpenters were an immensely talented duo, and achieved great success with their music. Sadly, this album was their last, as within 2 years of its release, Karen had passed away. I wish that another such duo would come along, given the sorry state of American music today."
4,Carpenter classic!,This carpenters cd is one of the albums made toward the end of there fabulous careers.It is till vintage Carpenters containing the usual classic ballads such as touch me when were dancing and because we are in love.There also some real feel good songs on here which include those good old dreams and (want you) back in my life again.The song beechwood 4-5789 although it may seem out of place on this cd adds a jukebox touch to this later Carpenters release.Far from there best cd but still a real nice treat for any Karen fan!!
4,Still holds up to this day!,"This album was hard to find until MCA/Universal decided to release it as a ""two-fer"" set. Just as good as I remembered it on record, and the sound Richard and Karen Carpenter created lives on."
2,skip this one,"I agree with the last reviewer-this is not a great album.But I also disagree on the issue of karen carpenter not being a good album artist.karen and richard were most definitely album artists-not singles artists.Most of their material was not designed for top 40 radio,and their greatest hits compilations are cluttered with horribly dated bubblegum tracks.(sing,sweet sweet smile,calling occupants,etc).this album,although boasting a great cover,contains very weak material.it is also their most pop-oriented release{unlike their jazzy 70's albums with piano,flute and sax solos}.karen carpenter is represented best on her classic albums CLOSE TO YOU,HORIZON and CHRISTMAS COLLECTION.{2 album set}.these three albums are packed with prime material,exquisite vocals and superb orchestrations.following these,i would recommend CARPENTERS AND LOVELINES."
2,bland and just does not work,"No heartfelt ballads. Nothing like 'I need to be in love'. This is lifeless pap. 'Strength of a woman' is bland and has a cringwworthy title. 'Back in my life again' is a bad synth piece of sappy bollox. I am amazed someone can compare this to the mid 1970's genius the Carpenters were puting out.'Beechwood 4-5789', errr no. Just yuck. Some of this just goes over my head.The good stuff? There are two good tracks. 'Somebody's lyin' is a nice, melodic ballad in their usual style. 'Because we are in love' (The Wedding Song) is a gorgeous orchestral ballad, written by Richard. This is the one true standout on the album.The magic seems to be gone here. Sorry."
2,Lack of passion,"At the risk of sounding like the other reviews, this is one of the two weakest Carpenters albums (the other being ""There's a Kind of Hush""). The reasons are the same for both albums. Richard. Specifically, Richard's choice of material on any given album and how he chooses to arrange that material. When he chooses well and arranges in a jazzy style (flutes, guitars, Karen's drumming style) the results are great. ""A Song For You"" is probably the best example. On this album, I don't think Karen drummed at all. There may have been better drummers, but being that this was her passion it was a shame to have stripped her of that.The material chosen was non discript and therefore not memorable. Throwing in everything but the kitchen sink doesn't help.Lack of passion and unremarkable material add up to a rating of 2."
1,Maxtor External Hard Drives have a HIGH failure rate,"I NEVER write reviews on products, but when something is this bad, I had to give my input. In over 18 years of working with computers, 7 years as a tech, I can tell you that the Maxtor External Hard Drives are some of the WORST products that I have ever purchased. I had a 200 GB die in 10 months, the company replaced it and the replacement died shortly after. I found a 80GB on sale (the 3100) and it died in 7 months. I made the mistake of not looking at the warranty period and was shocked to see it was only 3 months.. BOTH PRODUCTS HAD LESS THAN 5 HOURS BACKUP TIME!!They know that their 3100 is a low-grade product, so they only give you a 3 month warranty. I will never even look at Maxtor again.. external or internal. If you still ""must,"" have it, I suggest purchasing an extended warranty.. for at least 3 years!"
1,Do not buy a MAXTOR Device,"I have the External Hard Drive 200GB Personal Storage 3100. This Hard Drive is garbage, it is the 3rd one within 3 months, the previous 2 had the identical malfunction problems. Do not buy one of these devices. Their Support is a joke and claim they are not responsible."
5,Great 200 gig hard drive,I was amazed at the price of this item and when it came it looked new. Works well and is fast. I love the external USB storage.Richard
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"Same as everyone here, my unit died within a year. Lost 50 gig worth of photos, info, and music. This unit is a complete pile of junk and will die on you. You just better hope you have your backup backed up if you go with this unit. JUNK!"
1,Devistating product,"Bought the 80 gig version to transfer information from an old computer to a new computer...valuable information that cannot be replaced such as memories - hundreds of pictures. The hard drive stopped working before the information could transferred to the new computer. I don't know if I will ever be able to get anything back off of it, and the memories may be lost. A waste of money and a heartbreaking product. Do not buy a Maxtor!"
1,This product is a piece of garbage,I bought this item 6 months ago and it already died. I lost all of the data on the disk. Checked the warranty and was disgusted to see that it was already expired. It just started making strange noises one day and that was the end of it.
1,"A hateful, spiteful worthless account","The writer is obviously repulsed by everything about Kurt and only wrote this book for the cash. He takes glee in slamming not only the man, but the music and by extension, the fans. This creep does not deserve your money or your time. Read Come As You Are instead. Kurt wasn't perfect but he deserves better than this."
1,Based on Tabloids,This book is based on tabloid news and is not to bebelieved. The worst book ever written on or about Nirvana.It does have some cool pictures though.
1,I need to give it zero stars,"My background in journalism taught me to have a healthy skepticism about famous people, but it also taught me to do honest and ethical reporting about my subjects.In his largely inaccurate screed about Cobain, Sandford not only manages to waste trees and ink, he also proves his irrationality by picking on a dead man. Too convinentely, all of the ""credible sources"" he cites are unbalanced and very visibly envious of what this young man had accomplished while only in his 20's.The right to explore all of a person's components is confused with the abusive practice of making up falsehoods about them to feel good about one's ownself. Today it was Kurt who was maligined, tommorrow who knows what his next vicious target will be.Kurt was not perfect, but then again--neither is anybody else on this big, blue planet of ours."
1,"Cruel, Inaccurate writing","this book is a waste of time and money, and makes kurt out to be a terrible person instead of the talented musician, compassionate person, loving father, and ""average guy"" that he really was. it should tell more about his death and/or mention the possibility that he was murdered. the writer obviously wrote for money, and his so-called ""sources"" are undependable. DO NOT get this book unless you are prepared for a major kurt thrashing, or you want to tear out the pictures(which i did).try one of the other, more accurate books."
2,Why Diss A Legend?,"First off i liked this book in the beggining it caught my attention,even through the constant lies and errors.It contains alot of informative bits and pieces,many are untrue but it makes for a great fictional world.Dissing is a large part of this book,Kurt gets ranked on even after he died.Thats really disrespectful, ecspecially toward the person who shaped modern rock.Some of the info that holds true for the most part is too generic.Rehashed info we knew for many years.Kurt is portrayed as moody beyond belief and a loser.Hey there is pictures!Redeeming?No but something to tide over your bordem and to prepare you for more lies.They do cover a good amount of time in good detail though so the book isn't entirley bad.I think this is a bare minimum decent book,and thats all i can afford to give this book."
1,Kurt Cobain,"I didn't expect sugar coating about this artist's life, but this author's words & descriptions drip with hate. Every chance he gets, he goes out of his way to tell the reader that Kurt didn't deserve any of the success he achieved. Mr. Sandford also thinks of himself as an amateur psychiatrist, offering his own opinions on Kurt's motives on just about everything! What these opinions are based on is not clear. It sounds like Mr. Sandford has appointed himself the one to ""expose"" that Kurt Cobain did not deserve his place in the music world. How disappointing."
2,An over-all failure,"There are certain elements of this book which can be praised, for example, Sandford's highlighting of Cobain's manic-depression, which, certainly, was extant, and, as equally certain, and influence upon his art. But one would generally assume that a person who is willing to devote sufficient time to write a biography of a particular subject would actually ENJOY his subject before doing so, and that is an impression which the author fails to sustain throughout this book. Obviously, anyone who reads Sandford's biography has an abiding, if not intense, interest in Nirvana, Kurt Cobain and his music, and would therefore NOT be interested to hear any arbitrary or unworthwhile defamations of their mutual character. Generally, this is a book to be avoided. Instead, try either Charles Cross's ""Heavier Than Heaven"", or Michael Azzerad's ""Come As You Are"", both of which are much more enjoyable, and ten-times as sympathetic to the subject which they portray."
1,Interesting but only as fictionalized truth,"I bought this with the expectation that it was an in-depth, thorough account of Kurt Cobain's life...instead it's more like one man's take on that life set to tabloid journalism or fiction. If you're going to write about a real person, at least get the truth and back it up with facts - not innuendo, 'unnamed sources', and the like. The author stated some things that are truly terrible, yet did not back them up at all. If Kurt was alive, I'd say he should sue! If Courtney cares at all about the reputation of the father of her child, then she should sue! Also, from the tone, it sounds as if the author totally disliked Kurt Cobain with and without the music. Journalism should be unbiased, and this book is not. It's an interesting book, as long as you don't always believe what you read. Come As You Are is much better."
1,Pack of Lies,"Character assasination, slander, hearsay,animosity. This is what this book's all about. Sandford has no love for Cobain, and that's obvious. He has a love for money made from this book, and for ""notoriety"". Does he think the sleaze who gave him these rumours and half baked stories count as sources? No they are just parasites trying to make name for themselves at Kurts expense.(Just like he is). Cobain was a troubled guy, but i feel i sort of know Kurt and there's no way a heart so pure could be so vile. The empty heart and vile person of Christopher sandford will try and tell you different. DONT BELIEVE IT!"
1,Utter garbage,"This book is the most vile, poorly written, shoddily researched piece of trash I've ever read in my life. I can only agree with Jack Endino that the author was too dimwitted to realise he was being taken for a ride by the majority of his (unnamed) sources; the fact that he chose to print their various outlandish and unproven claims as fact is quite pathetic. I would give a wide berth to any other fiction book written by this moron under the guise of biography, my grandmother knows more about Nirvana than he does. Anyone interested in Kurt Cobain should read the Azerrad and Cross bio's, then piece together the rest for themselves from interviews, videos etc.. but whatever you do avoid this drivel!!!! I hope there is a circle in hell reserved for tabloid journo's trying to make a name for themselves by peddling nonsense about people infinitely more talented than they are.. Christopher Sandford is a cockroach. No stars."
3,not the best,"First I bought ""Heavier Than Heaven,"" and I loved it, so I figured that I would read another Kurt Cobain book. I like the format of this book...it is written very factually with many supporting quotes, but it doesn't talk much about the positive aspects of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain. I'm not asking for the whole book to put him in a positive spotlight, but most of the book portrays Kurt very negatively, and I thought they could talk a little more about his accomplishments than all of the horrible things he did."
2,THIS IS SO K,"Uggh, Kurt was a musician, not one of the Backstreet Boys, okay? No one needed to know about his different girlfriends and stuff. Not a lot of music and half of the stuff I didn't understand."
1,"Horrible, False Work","If you want to read a book about Kurt Cobain, chances are you want to hear good things about him but also the truth. This book is horrible, and talks about things that people said he did but have no proof of. Celebrities will always have things said about them that isn't true, and Kurt Cobain is one of them. But, I didn't want to hear about some girl saying that he ""raped her."" I'm mad that the author of this book would even publish such garbage. If you want to buy a Kurt Cobain book, I suggest Charles Cross' Heavier Than Heaven. It's the best out there."
3,Now I'm confused,"I have to admit I bought it all, hook, line and sinker as they say. I guess I have to believe the bad reviews. I wonder how much of either reviews are true now. I did come away thinking Kurt was one messed up dude. I still believe that. But, now, there's a doubt about how much and where he was really messed up... I enjoyed the book overall and am disappointed to find out I still don't know a thing about Kurt Cobain. Or do I?"
2,This is a vile book,"Not really a book about Kurt Cobain as much as it is a book about how Christopher Sandford is better than Kurt Cobain. Filled with snide remarks like ""..[Cobain] knew his music was depressingly average"". Not just content with a simple character assasination the author takes shots at the music as well. Look, Cobain was no saint and I was ready for 'the dirt' but the overbearing nature of it all, how there's attacks EVERY PAGE and shaky rumour and innuendo flooding the text really REALLY makes it hard to read as you're sure you're only getting half the story. I have heard that ""Heavier Than Heaven"" book is much more scholarly and focused with less of an agenda and I regret not getting that one."
1,...,"This book is garbage. It claims to be non-biased when it is flagrantly anti-Cobain. Much of this book is dedicated to long-winded B.S. analysis of every Cobain song. Sandford obviously made a concerted to cast Kurt in the worst light possible. I neither love nor hate Kurt, yet I was outraged by how Sandford would dedicate so much time to discussing Kurt's drug abuse that the praise worthy things Kurt did do are glossed over. Sandford mentions that Kurt donated thousands of dollars to charities and then promptly dedicates a paragraph to Kurt's penchance for photos of diseased vaginas. This book [was] uninformative..."
1,Cobain rises from the dead to kill Christopher Sandford,"Mr. Sandford provides relentless negativity regarding Cobain. I find myself feeling as negative as he portrays Cobain. You may want to avoid the misery of reading this book. At first I thought perhaps he was trying to discourage copycat suicides or behavior by ridiculing Cobain's existence, however he even manages to discredit Cobain's sympathy for terminally ill children. Perhaps Sandford should consider ridding the world of his foul observations of public figures for profit."
1,Nothing but fabrications,"This man met me for half an hour under the pretense of ""research."" He wrote or recorded nothing, yet quotes me heavily, with doozers such as comparing Kurt to Mick Jagger. What????? I couldn't even pull that one out of a hat. Well, turns out he wrote a book about Jagger, so had to pull him in somehow. Nothing but a pack of lies. If I could give it no stars I would. Please give this one a pass. And if I ever run across this creep again...."
2,Tiring Read,"Although this work does contain some insights into the life of Kurt Cobain, it's repetitive, often self-contradictory, and far too long for the amount of information presented. Many quotes appear without attribution, while others are used over and over again too re-emphasize tired points. Sandford makes frequent analogies between Cobain and Jimmy Hendrix which seem to serve more as a vehicle for the author's extensive knowledge of latter than to contribute to an analysis of the former's life. Other potentially interesting inquiries are ignored (e.g. surprisingly, to me at least, members of the band R.E.M. pop up several times as friends and likely musical collaborators of Cobain, yet there is no discussion of how the parties knew each other, what the context of the relationship was, etc.) On the whole it seems that the author was faced with limited cooperative sources and was forced to over use this material and augment it with filler and speculation to complete the book."
2,Kurt Cobain,The author was definetly not a Kurt Cobain or Nirvana fan as far as I am concerned and I felt he was very biased. There are much better books on Kurt Cobain or Nirvana that you could purchase.
4,detailed.,"this was the first biographay of kurt that i have read, and i have to say that it made me a little bit sick. while some of the author's sources are questionable, as other reviewers have pounced upon, the biography presents an honest and unfliching view of cobain's life. i have to say that drugs really [mess] you up, and kurt was no exception. sandford shows kurt's true side that is often glossed over by admiring fans. i, myself, am a huge nirvana fan, but i also believe that kurt was emtionally unstable and out of control. which is not to say that he was also incredibly brilliant. i have to go listen to unplugged in new york now. buy the book. but it might make you sick."
2,relentlessly negative and mean spirited,"I suppose I could be one of the people who wants more sugar coating, but I didn't go into it expecting Cobain to be a saint, or even someone I'd enjoy hanging out with, even though I love the albums. The relentless negative stories with too little sunshine in between just feels like an author with an agenda, rather that being indicative of ""good honest journalism"". I dreaded going back each time to make myself finish it."
3,Not the Best,"I am the biggest Nirvana fan in my city. This book kinda made a mockary of the best in the business Kurt Donald Cobain. There were ""quotes"" in this book, that weren't even close to sounding true. This book sounded that Christopher Sandford was right there next to Kurt through out his life. Overall this book is sorry....in its own way!"
3,Not the Best Kurt Cobain Book,"I found this book to have a lot of great information about the life of Kurt Cobain, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you read Heavier than Heaven, you will notice that some of the information in this novel is false. I also found it to be very repetitive. It is also not a very easy read. I would recommend Heavier than Heaven if you're looking for a good biography on Kurt Cobain, but if you're looking for some more insight into his life, then check this book out."
1,not what i ordered,it does not come in the can like it shows and my bird will not touch it it was more poweder thank any type of seed. not very happy at all.
5,Best Pain Relieving Gel!!!,This product was recommended to me by my chiropractor. It has helped me tremendously. I am finally able to sleep through the night with the aid of Cat's Claw for my aches and pain. You will not be disappointed. It is so much better than icy hot plus it doesn't have that strong menthol smell.
5,Excellent product,"I bought this for my elderly mother, who suffers from diabetic neuropathy, arthritis, sciatica -- you name it. She was surprised and delighted with the effect. It is now her first-line treatment for such pain. Don't worry about the cost; this is worth a try."
4,Love it. But pump does not work,"Great product. But like others have said, the pump does not work at all, But again product is good.I might wait till the pump is fixed to purchase this again."
3,Slaughterhouse: The Handbook of the Eastern Front,I am not a WWII history pro. This book is mostly an exhaustive order of battle for the Easstern front. There is a brief outline of the chronology of the Eastern Front at the beginning. There are neat biographies of the generals on both sides. The weapons section at the end needs production numbers to get an idea what was actually used on the battle field.
5,Required reading!!!,This should be taught as Butch 101. I wish it were on the shelves of my local library and especially at my local high school.
1,Cry Hubris!!!,"Much as we appreciated the postmodern elements of this undertaking -- what with Mr. Wainwright and company's performing the entire Judy @ Carnegie Hall reportoire using the original Mort Lindsey arrangements, to boot -- and the effort expended by all and sundry connected to this production, we couldn't help but be reminded of a quote from fictional character Addison DeWitt which I paraphrase below:""Mr. Wainwright's talent wasn't tall enough for that gesture.""Watching this concert felt frighteningly like those occasions when one was made to sit through a neighbor's precocious child performing for his relatives. Makes one question just how inured we've become to mediocrity and ersatz ""talent"" for lack of anything better. Rufus!Rufus!Rufus! doing Judy!Judy!Judy was Sad!Sad!Sad, indeed."
5,Well shot & sounds fantastic.,"This is by far the best concert DVD I've ever seen. There are little to no shots of the audience, which is rare among modern concert videos. It's like being there. If you like American Songbook tunes and you like Rufus, then this is a must buy."
5,Easy Cookbook you can Actually use!!,"I've looked at a lot of cookbooks & own a few that are so complex & full of ingredients I don't have that they sit there on the shelf. This Is NOT one of Those books!!It was composed for Medical Marijuana Patients, recipes sent in by people & tested by Green Cross Patient Co-op Members.Table of Contents: Marjuana Cooking Conversions, Breads, Cakes, Cookies, Pies, Main Dishes, Soups, Sides, Dips Drinks, Sauces & Misc. Snacks...And like I said, Usually you can find most ingredients in your frig!!Large Print!!!! Coupled with bits of Educational tid-bits throughout the book that make you say, ""Wow, I didn't know that!! It's a FUN BOOK!!Bhang, Flour, Butter/Margarine, Green Oil, Green Tea, Tincture (some basics), Plus Whole dinners that bring out the best of your ""Medicine"". No Regrets with this Cookbook--It's a WINNER!! It Won't be just another one sitting on the shelf! Entertaining as well...""A Spliff a day keeps the doctor away!!Total Winner!! ~Quillnink"
4,Good Effort from Horner,"It's interesting how some scores are actually better when heard out of the context of the films they compliment. I hadn't actually seen ""Mighty Joe Young"" when I picked up this album, but I was very impressed by the music. The lush orchestrations and thematic richness reminded me of Horner's early fantasy scores, and his use of the African choir was alternately rousing and heart-rending. Although I ultimately didn't find the film quite as compelling, Horner's music remains a very listenable, inspirational part of my soundtrack collection."
5,James Horner has a emotional ability beyond all,"Who could ever forget the point where Jack dies in Titanic and the score starts up. Jack's death wasn't the tear maker. It was James Horners stirring piece. He picks pieces from all his films and reuses them. You hear bits of titanic, Legends of the fall, Casper. The man is a higher being"
3,Average work by Horner,I only bought this CD for the lullabye song that was in the movie. That was the only thing I liked about it. I felt that some of the tracks were rehashed from other previous works he has made and it was nothing spectacular.
2,could of been better,this soundtrack could of been better!!It sounds almost like he remastered the congo soundtrack!!!Some of the tracks are very similar to that cd!!!!It also could of been longer !!!
3,An Almost Brilliant Mix Tape,"The songs here range from smart, if overly familiar, electro-pop to a few Latin rockers; however, the flow comes to a grinding halt whenever the bits of soundtrack score are played. I'm sure they were perfectly evocative and moody for the images they were meant to accompany, but standing alone they are crushingly boring. My recommendation is to buy the CD (or borrow if you can) and just rip the songs by the contributing artists - making the near brilliant mix tape to chill out to."
5,Exceptional Stand-Alone Math Text/Program,"As a homeschooling parent of a high schooler all I can say in reviewing this product is the following:THANK YOU, MARGARET LIAL AND COHORTS, FOR EXTENDING AN EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT!!"
5,Great anime!,"Moribito is a great anime mini-series. Based in an alternate Japanese setting, it is the story of a female guard and her last commision, the younger son of the Mikado. Good graphics, solid story, good pacing. As good as, or better than, The Twelve Kingdoms."
4,Great Anime,"Great Story, Great Animation, and Great Music.I recommend this animation for anyone that is into fantasy genre stories with swords & maritial arts, honor/responsibility, magic, and running and traveling around in beautiful scenes of mother nature."
5,An awesome title for the Game Gear!,"This entry for the Game Gear is highly addictive and enjoyable. It's different from your typical Sonic Adventure. First thing that comes to mind, Tails is S-U-P-E-R S-L-O-W; unlike his pal Sonic (who doesn't even appear at all in this game). Tails retains his flying ability, which is necessary at passing certain obstacles. And comes with an abundance of items and power-ups (you have to find them first). I like how the soundtrack sounds a lot like Triple Trouble's. (And IMO, ""Triple Trouble"" has one of the best soundtracks for the Game Gear!) I would recommend this game to ANY Game Gear/Hardcore Sonic Fan. 5 Stars!"
1,misleading title,"The title was misleading. This is actually a reprint of War on the Saints, the expurgated version. I think War on the Saints is a valuable book (the full version, that is). I never would have bought this book if I had known I was just getting a copy of a book I already had, but with important sections missing!"
2,Not worth it,"I bought these with a coupon making them about 12 cents a diaper and I will not buy them again. They were awful for nighttime because they could not hold enough liquid. They also do not go up very high, so if she has a nasty poop it leaks all out the back. They work fine for everyday during the day pee-pee diapers, but that's it. I much prefer Luvs to these diapers, although now that she is moving around I think I will swicth to something with strecth. It costs more, but she needs less diaper changes than she did before, so it all evens out."
3,Product description poor,"I couldn't tell the difference between this one and the Dampit Super. So I chose the less expensive one. It turned out that it was smaller (thinner) than the other one.However, I have an old ukelelie that I might be able to use these smaller ones on."
3,don't know exactly what to say,"so i got this humidifier to hopefully fix my buzzing problem but it didn't work. now well into the warmer months, maybe it'll go away. the product probably works, but i just didn't use it right."
1,too small - be sure to order the bigger one!!!,"This particular Dampit is way to small for an average sized acoustic guitar. It looks like it was made for a violin. ""Be sure to order the bigger-larger one"". When I did the Amazon search to look for the Dampit, this is the 1st one that came up. I had no clue I was ordering this tiny little thing.I have 2 other Dampits of the ""larger"" size and they work great in my 2 other Martin guitars. I needed a 3rd one for my new guitar and this small one doesn't cut it. You need to add water to it everyday, It's that small..Anyways...live and learn...and be sure to know exactly what you are getting before you order.It wasn't worth my time and effort to ship this back...Edited: 3-08-10After e-mailing B&G; Music w/ my concerns listed above, they sent me the bigger Dampit ""free of charge"".B&G; proved they are a stand-up company to deal with. I would do business with them again. Not many companies would go that extra mile to satisfy a customer. Thank you B&G; Music!"
3,Works well,"This was the humidifer that the music store salesman recommended when I purchased my guitar. I now have two guitars and two dampits for several years. They work well but dry out after about 3 days with guitar in its case. They must be completedly wringed out before use to avoid drips inside the guitar. I will be switching to a gel system that lasts longer so that there will be no concern when I am away on long vacations.P.S. The included humidity ""meter"" is worthless. Has not changed reading in 5 years."
2,Not shipping with clip shown in picture,"This product does what it says, but the last few units I received (and returned) have not had the string clip that shows in the picture. You can just let two strings hold it in place, but that puts extra tension on them... that I personally don't want.Also, you need to wring it out pretty good preferably with a towel since any water on the inside wall of the rubber hose can drip out and discolor the inside of your instrument, or worse, soak through to the outside, yikes!"
4,Sci-fi classic of the 40's,"This is a classic. If many of its themes are a cliche today, it is only because this film was one of the first to use them. The visual effects still hold up well. Conventional techniques like rear-screen projection were used to maximum effect and are not obvious despite the color photography, still a novelty in 1941. The basic concept of miniaturizing living creatures via exposure to radium is, of course, scientifically naive, but director Ernest Schoedsack did his best to give it a weird plausibility. The directing, acting and editing are all fine. On the other hand, the dialogue is rather weak (my reason for not giving it 5 stars) - one need only to compare it with the dialogue Schoedsack's own ""King Kong"" of 1933. Albert Dekker, as Dr. Thorkel, has the best lines and the best acting role; the others did well with the material they had. Overall, this is much superior to the movies of the fifties and sixties with similar themes."
3,"GOOD SCI-FI , BUT NOT MY FAVORITE SHRINKING PEOPLE FILM!","It's hard to believe that I never saw this film as a kid! I never missed the weekly sci-fi/horror films on TV Saturday night and afternoon but , for some reason I never got around to this one. I was in a nostalgic mood this Halloween and wanted to watch some of my old favorites. I decided to watch this film as a starter for my Halloween horror marathon. It is a nice surprise to watch something so old that you have never seen and for the most part this film did not disappoint me. It has good special effects and typical story line but it just wasn't familiar to me and that is why I give it 3 stars. I can understand other reviewer's giving this a higher rating because they grew up with it and it is special to each of them. This is available on DVD on Ultimate Sci-Fi classic collection volume 2. The DVD transfer and print are really nice!"
5,amazing book!!!,great book to prepare for pregancy and child birth. so inspiring stories. she shows us a more whole and natural perspective of life and birth.really important to read if you are thinking of having a child.
2,"Medicore, Uninspiring Grooves","I bought this CD along with the Tsotsi soundtrack. (Which I don't suggest -- Amazon shipped them seperately and it took over a month for this CD to arrive.) I was blown away by the music featured in Tsotsi and expected the same out of this. The CD's strongest song is the first on the disk. The songs' beats are too slow to be interesting and not danceable. The recording quality can vary, and the bass overpowers most of the songs. The music is repetitive, mediocre, and just not fun -- even unauthentic. A lot of the songs have some English thrown into the lyrics, about nothing interesting in particular. There are a few good songs, mostly on the first half of the disk, but you're much better off getting the Tsptsi soundtrack, even if it doesn't have as many different artists featured on this one."
5,Superb Top Quality Kwaito music!!!!!,This is by far the BEST compilation of Kwaito artists I have heard. All tracks on this CD are excellent. We have listened to this CD multiple times in just the few short weeks that we have purchased it.I highly recommend this CD to anyone that loves South African Hip-hop and to anyone that is just learning about Kwaito music.
2,Too small and poor quality,"Had I known they would be this small and so thin, I would NOT hadve ordered them. To add insult to injury, I can't return them. The original case has been ""broken"" and even though there only 4 diapers out of 160 missing, they are unreturnable. So, I would have had to know they would fit before I ordered them. We tried to make them them work using duct tape, but they are of such poor quality, they dont hold up. They must be European sized. Since I am stuck with them, we'll use them as coasters, disposable footies, unusual rain hats, to dry the car after I wash it (that ought to use about 100)."
3,"Interesting, but a bit deceptive","At the risk of being ""unpopular"", I thought the same as Apple from TX did about this book. It wasn't as political as the blurbs would have you believe, save for a few lines thrown in here and there as an aside, but not so much as a part of the main action. I bought this expecting a deeper delve into this subject, but was instead given it on the surface. That didn't make the story less interesting though. I still found the characters appealing and the storyline itself was fun. I just wish that the publishers had not overstated the whole Bush theme because that's what I was looking for more of in this book. In short, had I not been expecting the Bush Administration aspect so highly advertised, I would have been more impressed."
3,Meh,"I won't bore anyone with a plot synopsis. This book had so much premise, but felt like it was two books in one. Overall, the two main characters were interesting and the initial premise and commentary on NCLB and the US test obsession kept me reading. But, somewhere things started to unravel for me and I finished the book and placed it in the take to the used bookstore pile and not in the place in my bookshelf pile.My title for my review sums it up, ""Meh."""
2,Try an editorial next time,"The story lines were just a strange facade to some political thoughts that never actually materialized as a solid statement. I kept reading as the two main characters were interesting, but in the end nothing really ties together. Even an uberliberal would have preferred a bit more subtly in presenting this point of view. I could not become empathetic to a character who basically stalks a young girl and then doesn't set any boundries in his ""care-taking"" A less-than-perfect hero is always appreciated, but I couldn't buy him as a future influential leader for any party."
5,A book for our time,"John McNally executes at a high level in ""America's Report Card."" He gives us entertaining and compelling main charcters in Charlie and Janie. The plot is driven by a 302 HP engine. I defy you to put this book down before reaching the end. Why it isn't a top 100 Amazon book I'll never know, but do yourself a favor, buy ""America's Report Card,"" and you'll be discovering one of the finest writers."
3,"Many, very short (!) definitions","From the point of view of a learner of the English language (advanced level), as I am, I have to admit that this dictionary is not as good as I expected.Of course, the amount of words and phrases is extensive with about 240,000. Nonetheless, this dictionary is not called 'concise' just for the fun of it. It is in some cases too concise, using defining words I don't even understand or which are the same as in the word I looked up in the first place.Thus, my expressed recommendation goes to the Cambridge International Dictionary of English, which only uses a ""strictly controlled 2000-word Defining Vocabulary"" ensuring a high level of understanding."
5,"For a small dictionary, the Oxford Concise is excellent",I tried the Oxford Pocket American Dictionary and was VERY disappointed. The Oxford Concise is excellent and just what I wanted. It is small and handy but also thorough and has enough depth of definition to suit me. It is a wonderful reference volume and perfect for my home office.
1,A most awkward pronunciation guide,"The International Phonetic Alphabet is not the pronunciation guide I grew up with. The ""o"" sound in ""no"" is depicted by an upside down and backward ""e"" followed by an upside down Greek omega. Since it is a British dictionary, the ""a"" in ""bath"" is pronounced like the ""ar"" in ""arm"", not like ""a"" in ""pat"". I use a whole lot more ""r"" in my pronunciation than a proper Englishman would, too. Stress marks precede the accented syllable with secondary accents depicted by a comma. Syllable divisions are not shown. With the pronunciation key only on pages xv and xvi of the introduction, instead of on every page, pronouncing a new word is a challenge.I use this dictionary only when I can't find a word in my American Heritage Dictionary. It helped with ""grimoire"" and ""dog-end""."
1,really bad buy,"I bought this player because I had a great sony playerfor years with no problem. I listen to books on it. Thisone started out with really short battery life so I bought a dc adapter at radio shack. ( couldn't find a sony one) worked for a while. Now if I I move itat all, and sometimes don't touch it at all it just stops. I have to start over and go thru the same thingagain. I do not plan to buy any electronics thru Amazonagain because I'm just stuck with this useless thing.What happene to Sony - I don't think I'll be buying aSony product again either. Really didn't want to giveany stars!"
1,No disk,"I bought 2 Sony Walkman in the last year and half. Both stop working. Reason given ""no Disk"" duh/ The first one I thought maybe it was just a bad one so I tried again and the same thing happen. When I brought them back to Target they tell me its been more than 90 days so they are not gauranteed longer than that. I assume when I bought the Sony I was buying something to last. They were 39.95 each. I wish I could find a phone so number I can talk to someone at Sony(impossible). I have tried all their suggestions as how to fix the problem. I will not ever buy another Sony product. The model #s are D-FJ041 and D-EJ011."
4,good except for the headphones,"I have been using my old sony cd-player for a couple of years before it stopped working. That's when I bought this replacement model. It's a pretty good cd-player that plays all my Cds and has the radio option as well. My biggest problem with the player is the headphones. They are so uncomfortable that I chose not to use them, and had to buy another pair of headphones instead to hook up to this cd-player.ProsAttractive designGood soundComfortable to useConsThe headphones included were a jokeMinor and rare playing problems do occur, particularly with some of my old cds.With the exception of the above issures, I am satisfied with this cd player."
2,"Great, but only if you don't want to ever use the worthless radio...","How many times does this product appear throughout the Amazon inventory? At least three that I can tell so far. This is my third review of this same product! The radio, both AM and FM, is garbage. Static beyond imagination and the lousiest reception ever. But if you play a CD on it, the sound is fantastic. Clear and distortion free...totally opposite of the radio!"
3,battery hog,"needs two AA batteries, that last roughly 2 - 3 hours of play time. the window that displays the commands is very small, very difficult to read in the subdued light or in the car. changing batteries is difficult as the cover opens only partially."
4,.portable cd player,i bought it as a gift and the person i bought it for says it's awsome. I listened to it and it is awsome.
2,Disappointed in Sony,"Sony D-FJ041 CD Walkman Portable CD Player with AM/FM TunerVery disappointed in this product. Purchased two for the family and within a month they started skipping, volume and clarity were poor. Would not recommend."
3,Sony walkman,"The only thing I did not like was that I had the same exact one before, and I paid less at the store than on Amazon."
1,really zero stars,"CD function stopped working after less than 20 days. Tried new batteries and another CD. Huge disappointment. Radio still worked; but I regularly listen to Audio books. Received the Walkman from Amazon 1-7-12 and returned the product 1-28-12. Amazon gave me until 2-12-12 to return it. If it broke after that date, I would have had to deal with Sony. Fortunately I still have my over 10 year old Sony Walkman. So what if it skips....I just wait till the story continues. I guess they just ""don't make them like they used to"".I hesitate to order another Sony, especially now that I've read the negative reviews. I also hesitate to order another one from Amazon. I will probably look for another CD player in stores in my area. I'd rather take my chances with possible returns in a local store."
1,I wish I could give a zero,"This product is a total piece of cheap garbage. I would expect Sony to have a decent mid-priced Walkman. I paid extra to get it overnight because I was going out of town and wanted to listen on the plane. I played one CD with brand new Monster batteries and then it stopped. Totally useless. Changing CDs didn't accomplish anything. The radio played, but who cares. Get your act together Sony. You used to be a good company with quality control."
3,Battery placement and life not good,"I use this CD player to listen to books on the train. It replaced a fantastic panasonic CT582V that I loved (no longer available). I do not like this cd player. The batteries run out quickly, and getting to the batteries is impossible - awkward almost impossible to pull out.Currently looking for my old one on line - can't seem to find one that is even close to it's quality."
1,PRODUCT IS JUNK,This Walkman was used a total of two times. The volume control failed. I called Sony and they stated that we could get a REFURBISHED unit instead of a new one. Also service would cost me $29.99 for Sony to look at the player and see what is wrong with it. I only paid $39.99 for the Walkman. Would not recommend this product.
4,Very well the best CD player I've ever owned,"Considering I tend to be overtly picky on quality (in every way), I'd rather go with Sony than any other brand. And this cd player, by far, is the best I've ever owned.And yet, I can only think of one problem- whenever I'd set the radio stations to my preferred stations and take out the batteries and replace them, the stations are at the default stations again, that gets annoying, so you better have batteries with very long life in them to enjoy your stations longer.Other than that, I seriously love it!"
2,Won't stay off!,"I purchased this walkman, new. I listen to Audio books. Sony is the only CD walkman that saves your place when turned off. The unit sound is good and never skips when walking or jogging. The problem with it: To listen to the CD, you have to turn up the vol, fine...but all of a sudden I'll be listening to the audio book and the radio comes blasting thru. To get the radio off, you have to hit the radio on button 2xs then the radio off button, then hopefully, when you turn on the CD, it comes up. This sometimes takes 2 - 3 attempts to get the CD back on. When I'm done with the player and set it down, noone near it and it the radio turns on by itself. Turn it off, comes back on. I called Sony they said it needs fixed, a dealer can look at it for $50. I only paid $45. So I'll wait till I get totaly frustrated with it and probably pitch it in the garbage and buy a new one. It will be a Sony, because it saves your place, but without the radio. Fortnately, I do use rechargable batteries."
4,walkman top quality,"This walkman is very good quality as far as sound, comfortable earpieces, never skips....only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it needs to have some way to carry it (pocket?) since it does not have a strap, case, etc. Other than that I completely enjoy it."
4,Nice CD player,For people who don't know how to use i tunes this is a great alternative. Unfortunately the radio doesn't get many signals where we live.
2,Not what I expected from Sony...,This must be an obsolete product. Did work just not as well as expected. Sony support was disappointing. The instructions say to use a power cord to save battery life none is included and you can't buy one any longer from Sony. Disappointing.
4,"cheap,light&#65292;just all right",It's a gift for my friend&#65292;she like it&#65292;that's all&#12290;but it's too light not so strong&#65292;hope will change the &#35774;&#35745; to &#26356;&#21152;&#37329;&#23646;&#19968;&#20123;
4,Walkman Portable Player,"This Walkman works very much like the one I had before, but beter, especially since it also has a tuner. I cannot use the ear buds, so had to buy an over the head set to go with."
3,"Good quality, but be careful it's what you want","I bought this as a gift for someone who wanted a portable CD player for listening to books on cd, because it has a bookmarking feature to make it easy to pick up where you left off.Two issues: it can only be used with earplugs (no speaker), and no AC adapter is included, so batteries are the only power source without an extra accessory.Now, this is my fault for not checking all that out, but a word to the wise for people with a similar objective, and not just seeking a jogging music device!Love Sony, but made a mistake."
3,not as good as my old one,"I needed to replace an old ""Sportsman"" by Sony. used it constantly to listen to audio books. finally wore it out. i purchased this model because it bookmarks tracts for audio books. The design is poor for older folks like me. ""buttons"" on the side are difficult to see as thay are all the same color and almost all the same shape. to fast forward or back, change the volume, etc. is difficult. I had to ""learn"" all the bottons by location to change functions without looking or without glasses! I miss my old Sony! much more user friendly. The bookmarking is the best feature for me."
2,"It works, but why the tiny unreadable labels and NO power-supply?","Comes with very rudimentary instructions. Three times the space is given to limited liability and limited warranty. I guess I should have expected no power supply but it would have been nice to tell me where i can get one. Like everything else in the electronic gadget business, the labels of the control buttons are nearly impossible to read unless you are 20 years old with 20/20 vision. If somebody started designing gadgets that older ADULTS can easily use, they;d make a huge fortune."
1,Rue the Day,"I rue the day I didn't read all of the one star reviews. They so cover the problem I am having with this piece of junk. It starts skipping out of the blue, not jolting or moving and then decides there is no disc. Will never buy Sony again. Such a disappointment."
1,Don't bother. Find something else.,"I've had this player for a couple of months. Never really enjoyed using it. I have tried using it solely for the past few months. The radio reception is useless compared to the old Sony players. The cd player grinds, groans and stops playing (even with fresh batteries). The small buttons are easy to hit and mess you up. I just put it away and dusted off my old banged up player to use."
3,terrible battery life,"If you're going to use this with an a/c adaptor as a cheap home cd player, go for it. However, battery life I got with new energizer batteries was two hours on FM radio plus 1.5 hours playing CDs. This is not enough for portable use."
4,Battery Hog,This is a very nice unit except it uses batteries real fast. I don't use the ear buds. I listen to books on cd and I have found this player to be very nice with the sound choices. Music sounds wonderful and I like having an am/fm radio.
3,problems with a good machine,"This is a very good machine, with poor instructions. The names on the various buttons are difficult to read, but the main problem is inadequate instructions, particularly not telling the user what to do when the machine will not advance to the next track, or just stops, or chooses arbitrary tracks."
3,"Okay, but not great...","The CD player works well, but the sound quality is not as high as I had hoped. The radio portion does not pull in stations as it should either. Lastly, the earplugs feel uncomfortable, not as good as Sony's headphones."
2,deceiving,the instructions show an adapter and the one of the images on amazon shows an adapter - but guess what - no adapter. it's irresponsible to not include the adapter. i thought if I paid a little extra i would get a high quality CD player - no so - its just average. save your money and pay for a less expensive CD player.
5,Second order a AAA plus player,The first one was for my wife and after mine kept giving me trouble I took Hers to use just one time and it never got returned . So had to order another one for Her. I use it on My bike to listen to audio books and helps Me go further in My rides. Tried several others players BUT this one never skips or shuts off on the rought roads and bumps.......................like it !!
1,gave me a stomach ache,"I was very excited to find a truly vegan glucosamine product -- there are other brands that put out vegan glucosamine, but in a gelatine soft cap(!!!) -- but this gave me a horrid stomach ache, even though I took it with food."
5,Wonderfully chuckley humor. Makes me smile.,"This book is very humorous. It brings to mind many of the bits of life I have lived. The best part is that it is not isolated issues. In addition, the sketches add a great deal to the total humor. I just happened to come across it in the library. Such a treat. Thank you for brightening my days."
5,A must for any adult who's lost a parent,"When I was 12 years old, my father died six weeks after a massive heart attack. A month ago, four days before my 34th birthday, my mother died suddenly. I'm a late-comer and my siblings are a much older than me. They have their families. I have my career. Although my religious beliefs give me peace, there is still an immense sadness. I am not yet married, my beloved will never know my wonderful parents. Any children I may have will never know their maternal grandparents. Both of my grandfathers died before I was born, so this causes me grief for what my children who aren't even born yet have lost.This book is wonderful and helped me to understand different feelings that I've been having and let me know that these feelings are not unique."
3,Best Of does not mean Best Performed,"This CD is a compilation of works performed by lesser known European orchestras. If you are a connoisseur a fine classical music, this album may be disappointing. I like all the selections on the album but am ""stung"" by the less than professional performances. The tempos, accents, dynamics are all less successfully executed than you would experience if this music were performed by a world renowned orchestra. So I rate this an OK & if I had researched the ""artists"" more, I would have probably sought out a better performance group for these ""Best of"" pieces."
3,Rossini,Good selection of music on this CD. My only complaint is that it seems as though they speeded up the tempo of all of the pieces so they could get them all on the CD.
3,Why are they doing this to us?!!!!!,"I have been waiting for ten friggin' years for my absolute favourite cartoon to make it to dvd. What do I get for not just buying illegal bootlegs off of the internet? MISSING EPISODES!!!!!! Once again one episode is exempt, making this an incomplete set. No reason was given. I do not buy the copyright infringement rumour as parody is very legal. Every character on this show is a parody of an earlier character. This is a five star show and I cannot give it more than three for not giving fans what they want: the whole series. Shame on the makers of this dvd."
1,Still waiting...,"A five star show that deserves to be released in its entirety, not missing episodes here and there. The UK has it:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tick-Complete-Collection-Season-1-3/dp/B00122M2D8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1327205581&sr;=8-3Why can't we????"
5,Egad!,"I'm just a huge Tick fan. The fact that each following episode plays on previous episodes is just awesome. Unfortunately, I don't think there was a third season... BRING BACK THE BIG BLUE BUG OF JUSTICE!"
4,The Tick vs. Buena Vista,"My only hesitation in strongly recommending every season of the Tick is the possibility that Buena Vista is deleting episodes from each season for the simple reason that they want to release a ""complete series"" box set after they are done with the seasons -- and they want to be sure that true fans will buy it all again by holding a few episodes back. This possibility presents itself because the seasons are available (or will soon be available) in the UK from a different distributor with no episodes missing, which might mean that Buena Vista is not being forthcoming with the truth behind the missing episodes here in the US. Despite the possible evil, it still makes the most sense to buy this US edition, even if it is missing one of the key episodes."
5,Lots of Laughs,"We watch these over and over. So many gags, colorful characters, and great personalities. And of course the big dumb blue guy with the big heart always wins in the end, even when he is ""unarmed"" or navigating the ""Yule Tide"" as the great blue salmon of justice. Just watch out for that petroleum jelly!"
4,Sony CD player a bit bulky,"This is a bigger, thicker unit than I have had in the past--but CD players are harder to come by these days, and I wanted one that would last. The interface has a bit more complexity, too, which I like to access by touch, and it is not as easy or intuitive as earlier Sonys Takes two AA batteries, which don't seem at add any extra life. I listen to audio books from the library, and so I don't really access the MP3 functions. I think it's OK, but I wish it were more slender and lighter."
1,bad luck with Dependable Resource,"My Sony Portable CD player just came with the packacking cut up and the power adapter and headphones missing. The CD player was taped up with some kind of tape around it. This is the first bad experience I have had with ordering through Amazon and the worst experience I have had ordering anything ever. Now I have to package this up, go to the post office, and order another CD player."
4,Sony D-NF340 CD Walkman & MP3 Player w/FM Tuner,"As an over 65+ user, I found the instructions to be hard to follow. I had a hard time getting the MP3 started and the volume on. Everything was on the remote which I didn't understand at first. I have not used the radio yet. The earbuds leave a lot to be desired as they fall out easily. Now I need a case and a plug in. Everything is good, so far."
3,Good player till it broke 3 months later,"I like this cd player except after 3 months the cd player broke. I now have to pay $29.99 plus the costs to ship it to Texas to have it repaired. It broke a couple days after the 3 month warranty so I'm being hit with the repair charge. I have a Panasonic portable cd player that still works and is 13 years old. This is a real bummer.When the player was working it was working great. I love the resume feature that takes you back to the exact place you were at on the cd. Also, you can make the display show you how much time is left on the cd. I don't know much about sound quality but everything sounded fine to me."
1,It Doesn't Work!,"I've been using a $15 CD player in my car for years, but I needed something that would play MP3 files of a book on CD, so this seemed like the one. Yes, it played MP3 files, but only from the beginning of an 11 hour CD! When I'd try to change to a different track, the player would turn off. Likewise if I tried to fast forward on a track. If there's a way to do this that I don't understand, it isn't mentioned in the directions. Also, after a few hours, the player started turning off with the slightest bump. I tried using regular CDs, and the same thing happened. Finally I couldn't get more than a few seconds of a song before the player stopped. I expected something very well made. It's a Sony, right? Maybe I just got a lemon. But I thought that as it was a Sony, it would work perfectly, so I threw away all the packaging. Now I can't even return it. It's not even a good paperweight. I'm seriously disappointed."
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,Sony D-NF340 CD Walkman & MP3 Player w/FM TunerThis is not a good item to purchase. I purchased one and after a few months it did not work properly. Skipped as you were listening to a book. Very frustrating. I just chalked it up as a fluke and ordered another one since the return time had passed. The second one did the same thing a few months later and it also exceeded the return time. I would never buy a Sony device like this again
4,Sony D NF340 CD MP3 Walkman,"I am happy I have these because I can put 80 to 100 songs on one CD and for about $15 I bought an electric cord to save on my batteries . When I go to the Doctor's or anywhere that takes long and is a bit scary (Dentist) I have several disks ,I guess the disks are kind of like different moods . Also if I had to go to the Hospital I would have enough music ,I get about 5 or 6 hours andbe sure to get a burning software online for MP3 I have dropped this CD player on concrete ,you name it and it still plays(knock on wood )I am very happy with the purchase, The FM radio works well too rsdno"
1,Not an ATRAC player!,"The product information shown for this item is confusing and misleading. The first paragraph says that it plays both MP-3 discs and ATRAC discs, while the second paragraph (also headed ""Product Information"") mentions only MP-3 (and conventional audio CDs). I purchased the item because I have Sony's Sonic Stage software (from a CD Walkman purchased earlier) and wanted another playback platform for ATRAC discs that I compile from my audio CDs. The product leaflet that came with the CD player states that it plays only MP-3 formal discs and conventional CDs. When I tried to play an ATRAC disc, the device showed ""no file."" I am returning the CD player. PLEASE correct the product information by omitting all mention of ATRAC and ATRACplus; this is an MP-3 player."
1,Johnny Hodges' probably never used a Sony D-NF340 player,"Based upon the glowing review of the Sony Walkman D-NF340 MP3 player by Johnny Hodges I bought the player. I was especially interested in the feature he described in which it remembered where it left off on a disk when shut off, returning to that point when turned on again. I couldn't find this feature in the instructions nor could I initiate it by playing with the different settings. I contacted Sony about it and here is their reply:X-Reverse-DNS: mail7.fw-bc.sony.comJohn,I'm sorry to inform you that the CD Player does not have Resume Play option ie, it cannot play back from where it has been stopped.Thank you for your time.The Sony Email Response TeamC1RTJenniferSo. What was Johnny Hodges testing that had this playback memory feature?"
4,Nice sound!,"I've had this for a couple of weeks now, and I'm pleased with it. I had to replace my old Sony D-E350 which finally gave up the ghost after years of service. I use Sennheiser PX 100 headphones with this, and I'm very happy with the sound quality. Note I only use it while sitting at a desk, so I can't comment on its skip-proof qualities. One negative: this seems to eat batteries compared to my old one. I'm using the same Energizer rechargable batteries as before, so apparently its the player. Have others noticed this? At any rate, it's not a big problem since I do use the rechargables. Overall, I'm quite satisfied and will buy a second one, since good portable CD players are becoming scarce."
5,Excellent choice,"I am very pleased with this product on many levels. Sound quality is excellent, features are easy to use and unlike my previous JVC walkman, this CD player is more stable and doesn't tend to skip or turn off at the slightest movement the way the JVC does. I found that extremely annoying so I am very pleased this Sony model doesn't do that. I think this CD player offers excellent value for the money and I highly recommend purchasing one."
4,SONY D-NF340 CD WALKMAN,"This Cd player is great, it's batteries last for a long time, I use it for audio books, and it starts up right where I turned it off from the last session. It has never skipped. Sound quality is great. Over all it is a very good system. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because I can hear some motor noise (almost like a creaky door opening) whenever it starts up the cd from a paused or sleep mode state."
2,Sony walkman,I bought this but I felt somewhat deceived. It said it was in original package but when I got it you coould tell it had been resealed. It was also missing the adapter cord so you can't plug it in. Also the remote control and headphones were missing. I paid top money for this thinking I was greeting a good deal but in reality I feel I got less than I paid for. Disappointing to say the least...
1,Skips On almost Every CD,I'm returning this player. It skips on almost every CD I try to play. I don't know why Sony had to reduce the quality of their CD players. I'm willing to pay a lot more. I guess I'll buy something discontinued if I have to.
1,NOT REALLY GOOD!!!,"Unfortunately I got the product with no accesories, and people that put the package on the mail noticed it and still sent it like that, really bother by this, it has been a month and I still not have my refund back.According with customer service It will with take few weeks but I'm still waiting for my money.Really bad experience I'm pretty bother by this."
3,Sony D-NF340,"This item did not have everthing that is advertized on the package. No remote control and no stereo headphones.There are spaces set up in the bubble pack for these items. However this item did not come from Amozan, it came from a store in New York. Tipicial"
1,Don't buy this...,"I have used this exactly twice and in that time have listened to about 2 cds. The battery had to be replaced and the controls already don't work. I have always bought Sony, but will now be hesitant. I didn't open the package for a few months, so it was too late to return it.It is made very cheaply."
1,Broken,"I took the time to really look up CD players. This was important because I needed a CD player that my Grandmother could listen to books on tape with. It needed a special feature to continue the story in the same place as when she shut it off. The first one I ordered, the company came back and said they couldn't ship it. The second from OneStopShop (that I had to pay expidited shipping to arrive in time) arrived broken. It kept shutting off after a minute of listening. I then had quite a problem with One Stop and Amazon getting a full refund. You end up paying to do business with them when you return a product. I do remember reading the reviews and I speciffically remember one that said this CD player could have this problem. Overall the ratings were good, as Amazon would like us to believe. However, my advice is to take a better look at the bad reviews. This was a disaster!Claudia"
4,Best buy for the money,Good sound quality and easy use. The only drawback is that you have to take out the disc to change batteries.
4,mp3 cd player,very happy with this product it really out shines the ones I've bought in the past from discount stores.
4,"great for CDs, not so for MP3","Like some other reviewers, I put a lot of stock in Johnny Hodges' long and detailed review, in choosing this product. I'm very happy with it as a CD player that can go with me to the gym and on walks, and hardly ever skip. Sound quality is very good (with my own earphones) and I don't hear background noise as some others report. However if you want to play MP3s, get an MP3 player for two reasons: Playing an MP3 CD will do in a set of new batteries in a little over an hour; you can't move from one track to another, even if the tracks were recorded from different CDs. You can ONLY play from start to finish. As to the radio function, it's fine, but I'd rather use my tiny pocket Radio Shack radio, with sound just as good."
2,Gift That Quit Giving,"My husband got this for me last Christmas and about 6 weeks ago, it started becoming intermittent -- stopping randomly and without reason. The CD I use in it is a sleep aid and that is ALL that plays in this item. The CD plays in three other players and on my lap top but now it no longer plays at all on this player. So I got 9 months on the player....not my idea of a well built product.Sony D-FJ041 CD Walkman Portable CD Player with AM/FM TunerUpsetting and disappointing"
1,"just received my sony walkman, however.......","I just received this walkman, but cannot get the sound to play from any of my CDs. The digital display seems to be working, but no sound. Also, I cannot get any sound from any of the radio stations. I have read and reread the directions. Is there something I'm not doing, or have I received a faulty item?"
5,Sony D-NF340 CD Walkman & MP3 Player,It does exactly what I wanted it to do. A great product for listening to cds while on the go.
4,Great CD player,"I bought this because I borrow mine to my friend, but compare with the old one, this one has lower volume. I listen to louder volume."
3,Missing Parts!,"My review is not about the CD player quality -- I have not yet played it.My concern is about the packaging: Sony is apparently sending out this unit to suppliers like Amazon without including the AC power supply, earbuds, and circle remote.Both orders were placed from the Amazon website. My first order was via Electronica Direct. After the first model came with the missing parts, I re-ordered direct through Amazon. Same thing. Missing parts.So, it appears Sony has sent out a bundle of packages without the accessories.I phoned Sony. They were helpful, and are sending me the parts direct, free of charge. However, there is the hassle of waiting 7-10 business days (i.e. 2 more weeks). When I paid for rush 2 day shipping on the initial order, this is of course frustrating.If I were to do it again for the first time: I would order directly from Sony: $49 and no shipping. Actually beats Amazon!"
3,Single CD player,"Despite instructions does not seem possible to repeat play automatically. Also, fairly noise and moving between play items.Finally, uses batteries very fast."
4,"John S, Johnny Hodges is correct...","...the NF340 *does* resume playback where left-off. I inserted a CD,played the first four tracks. turned the unit off and removed the CD.I then played around with the FM radio for a bit, got bored, reinsertedthe CD I had been listening to, turned it on, and it began playing at the fifth track."
2,worked for 2 years then just stopped,Product worked fine for 2 years and then just stopped. Contacted the company with no response. Google the serial number tfdu16072a and you will see that other people have had the same issue with no resolution.
4,great potential and acting but falls short,"I am immensely pleased to have found this film. Many of the performances (Anthony Hopkins, Hiroyuki Sanada, Alexandra Lara, and Laura Linney) were inspired but some (Charlotte Gainsburg) were not. The story is engaging but there were many aspects of the plot that did not make real practical or emotional sense. The motion of the plot is a bit formulaic. The story drew me in in spite of the gaps, however. The cinematography is lush and beautiful. I particularly liked the warmth of the relationshiop between Hopkins' and Sanada's characters and the coldness at the heart of both Linney's and Lara's portrayal of their characters. When all is said and done, as E.M. Forster said: ""only connect."""
4,"Comprehensive, Simple, Useful","I only give 5 stars to books that show new insights into problems. Terri's book shows no new insights, but it is a useful and practical collection of the basics of persuasive presentations.Much of it will be familiar to you, some will be new. Nothing is revolutionary but it's a helpful collection of all the basics and a handy reference for anyone who has to persuade an audience."
1,and anyone with a paintbrush can be a painter...,"Some people believe salesmen are born, not made. Sjodin, a public speaking and sales techniques consultant, insists anyone can become an effective seller by polishing his speaking skills and learning to sell himself and his ideas to business partners, investors, employers and supervisors.How insulting to people that earn their living in sales...If you follow her simple thought, anyone with a paint brush can become a master painter and if you have a wrench and screwdriver you can get a job as a mechanic.You either have what it takes or you don't!Her claim that anyone can become an effective seller by polishing his speaking skills and learning to sell himself and his ideas to business partners, investors, employers and supervisors is ridiculous! She probably makes more money selling books with great catch titles..."
4,Great watch,If you want a big and heavy watch. This is the right one. This is a great watch for everyday wear.
4,Good Film,"This was a well done independent film. The acting was decent and the storyline was good with a twist at the end that will leave you a little surprised. It's got what every good flick needs - money, love, sex wrapped in a good plot. It was shot in Detroit so if you're from there you'll probably recognize some of the spots. It's worth seeing, so check it out."
2,Very lacking,"Despite the other reviews of this book. I found it to be very lacking to the point it didn't say very much at all. It tried to cover too much ground with very minor arguments / evidence, also with obviously related material spread amongst different chapters.It basically appears to be much more of the author focusing on his personal favourite games (in particular Lara Croft / Tombraider which gets mentioned more than any other game in the book - she even gets a quote - 'Aha', alongside Plato and TS Eliot).The author admits to not playing video games for an extended period of time as well, and his biases clearly show (at least he actually mentions that he finds god-games tedious). I don't think he was really the right person to write this sort of book.Personally, I found it difficult to keep reading due to lack of interest - despite the writing style is basic and easy to read.My advice is to just read the last chapter in the bookstore."
4,"Well written, but dated","While preparing for a class I'm running on video games I opened up Trigger Happy which, for the most part, was a very well written and researched book on video game theory. However, while reading it, I became aware very quickly aware of how dated the book had become in just under a decade. The references to Tomb Raider 3, in particular, are rampant, a game that is not even a blip on the radar of gaming conciousness anymore. However, the ideas presented on asthetics and persistent worlds offer a look into video games that is still relevant today."
1,Steven Poole missed the boat big time!,"Good lord! Who wrote this clap-trap? Being involved with games and the games industry for over 20 years, I found this book neither informative or accurate. As dry a read as 'Phoenix: The Rise and Fall of Videogames' is, it is infinitely more competant than this book.Poole's blind observations of his favorite games sound irritatingly like the kid who hangs out at the local game store spewing his views of what's great and what's garbage. His bias runs throughout the book and proves that Poole has no real comprehension of this business.Do yourself a favor and buy either 'Phoenix' or 'The First Quarter' instead of this doorstop."
3,Nice... but where's the rest?,"Poole has a good point to make, and he makes it in the first chapter (that gamers are not social outcasts and games are a form of storytelling every bit as viable as film or literature). Unfortunately, he has about fifty other half-points to make and never finishes a single one of them. He makes a huge deal out of gender (hello... women have made up a nice percentage of gamers since the Pac-Man days!), which seems really counterproductive. His memoir-like descriptions of E3 and its Tokyo equivalent are entertaining, and he is a gifted writer, but 'Trigger Happy' reads like a conversation with a friend who missed an entire generation of gaming."
4,Great historical fiction,"Kings, Queens, sex, murder, mystical powers - intrigue at it's best. Remauro takes the reader back in time to understand the Irish political landscape at the turn of the eleventh century and introduces us to the great king, Brian Boru. I was fascinated by the charecters and surprised by the ending. Bravo!"
4,powerful historical fiction,"The author takes you on a mystical trip back to the eleventh century. Remauro captivates you, as she brings you into the politicial world of Ireland's King Brian Boru and his wife Kormlada."
3,Not ergonomic,"Although I had been using an iron of about the same weight (and liked it), this iron gave me the early warning signs of tendon strain almost immediately. The sole plate is huge, the iron is badly balanced, and overall it's very awkward to handle."
4,Enjoyable southern literature. Glad it's on my shelf.,"Sherman writes a good story. I can't explain why it held my interest so well because the plot was anything but complex. If you are a fan of literature about the haunted landscape of the South, you should give it a try."
1,"implausible, uninteresting","I read this book for school, and while I initially was into it, by the end I hated it. It feels thrown together and Cotton Moxley was like the bad guy in a B horror movie. The end where Jesse handcuffs himself to Cotton and the fight to the death was also ridiculous. As a class, we had the pleasure of Dayne Sherman's company and input on his reasons for and method behind writing this novel. Please do not pay full price for this book, you will be sorely disappointed! The worse part was, the University I attend and that he is employed by wouldn't even purchase this novel back."
3,Kitty doesn't need to roam,"I read this book before adopting our pet from the humane society. It helped me understand that an indoor cat can have a wonderful, happy life, without running around the neighborhood, getting into danger and hunting songbirds.In fact, they don't need as much space as I thought. our indoor cat is wonderful and well-adjusted.Good reference, I enjoyed it."
1,"filled with outdated research citations, inconclusive findin","Not only is this book difficult to read (because of all of the citations), there is no substance to it.The research mentioned in the book is out of date and inconclusive. All studies mentioned have very small research groups.A waste of time and money"
4,Not much battle,"This is a well-written book, an account of the sea battle off Trafalgar which destroyed the French-Spanish fleet and Napoleon's plans to invade England. However, the first 200 pages of the book leading up to the battle are really a comparison of the culture of the three countries and how it affected their navies and the outcome of the conflict. Interesting, but I kept asking, when does the battle start? The battle itself is fascinating but I expected more. Still, I'm glad I read it and I did learn a lot about that era."
3,"Seize the Fire: Heroism, Duty, and the Battle of... Trafalgar?","Mr. Nicolson has done a fine job of writing a book about the notions of Heroism and Duty, with even a dash of Honor thrown in. Societal woes and the blossoming of the bourgeois class are well navigated and occasionally set to a backdrop of one of, if not the greatest of Britain's (perhaps I should say England's) Naval victories. The first half of the book is a muddled read. The author alternately credits Nelson with brilliance of command with a complete denial that this particular engagement was anything more than a continuation of the changing norms of the various nations involved.Still, a good read, but not one for insight into either Nelson or Trafalgar."
3,"Seize the Fire: Heroism, Duty and the Battle of Trafalgar","This should not be considered a ""stand alone"" book for those who wish to know more of this momentous battle at sea. The title alone hints at the problem - The battle was OFF Trafalgar, not OF Trafalgar. Ron Adkins' ""Nelson's Trafalgar"" is far more incisive and readable. Further, the reader of the latter will learn sea lore that will allow dinner conversation to be as lively as standing on a poop deck in a storm. Adkins gives us the origin of ""slush fund."" Nicholson gives us dry wit. As a supplement, buy this along with ""Nelson's Trafalgar"" to fill the gaps, but don't buy it alone."
1,A Losing Battle,"The author uses a very bad writing technique: he starts the battle, then goes into a long diversion about British history, or the history of the British, Spanish or French Navies, or previous battles, or the histories of the people involved in the battle. Then he inches closer to the battle and interrupts with another long disgression. This removes virtually all drama from the story until finally, at the end, he allows the battle to commence. Here he takes great pains to stress blood and gore--way more than necssary. I am sure there are much better stories of this battle than this one."
3,A Battle Adrift,"The author is best at describing the actual ships and crews as they engaged at Trafalgar, Lord Nelson's decisive sea battle of 1805. At this he is very good. Less successful is his attempt to coherently explain the social and political dynamics at work in the nations that sent the fleets to war. I think England won because its fleet was better led, better manned, better equipped, and had greater motivation for victory. The reason for these advantages, in turn, was the foundation of a society fairly open to personal advancement and based on new commercial realties. In his book, Mr. Nicholson too often transfers his own thinking on such airy concepts of the sublime, love, honor, etc. back to a specific naval engagement conducted long ago by real human beings."
5,Excellent item for travel,I have a Baggallini purse and was pleased to find the cover for traveling. I have always needed to wait until my flat iron was cool before packing and this has solved my problem. Baggallini is a great brand with excellent quality.
4,Limited application,"A useful item for a small area which gets missed by rain, and that is the reason I bought it. However, it ties up a hose, and is only useful for limited application, so if you are dealing with a large area which needs water, a more traditional sprinkler would be a better choice."
1,Save Your Money,"The phone has the typical confusing, inadequate 100 page manual. Further, the manual has the usual poor index, so it is frustrating trying to find the items you are looking for. Even if a piece of software or electronic divice is full of great functions, it is useless if it takes a long time, or impossible to figure out. I spent a long time trying to figure out some of the functions, and some I was never able to get. My secretary is very frustrated with this phone.Also, even at the highest setting the volume is too low. Poor Sound quality.Mobile phone won't work with it.This phone is way too confusing, and poor quality for the price."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I work from home and spend a *lot* of time on the phone. I was really looking forward to being able to use my bluetooth headset with my land line phone, and get rid of my wired headset. Unfortunately the battery life of this handset barely would make it through 2-3 hours of talk time.The voice quality was considerably less than my current Panasonic phones, and the usability has a long way to go. For instance, while on speakerphone, you can go on mute. But you can't unmute without first turning off the speakerphone, then unmute, then go back to speakerphone. Lots of little annoyances like that.I never even got around to testing out the phonebook import feature, so I can't speak to that. In the end, I returned this phone and went back to my 5.8GHz Panasonic phone with a wired headset, where I can get 6-8 hours of talk time between charges. The search continues..."
3,"Good Features, but Battery?","I got one of these for my home office. It works great! The little CIDdisplay on the outside of the phone is hard to read, like other reviewerspointed out. The phone works great and you can download call lists viathe USB port and your PC. It's the only home phone that I know ofcompatible with Bluetooth for headsets. It's easy to set up, but thebluetooth option knocks the battery life out. I can do a ten minute calland then I get a low battery message on the handset. When I'm not usingbluetooth, I can talk all day on the handset. I'm not sure what'shappening here. Anyone with similar problems?"
5,Feature Rich and a cool toy.,"This phone was very easy to set up; yes, you have to read the directions! Pairing it with my PPC-6700 was painless and making or receiving calls on this system on my mobile or land line work perfectly. The hinge is a bit on the flimsy side but I hope it holds up for a while. It's a great system in the way it behaves like a mobile phone with a CD to download backgrounds and ring tones. You do have to keep the mobile phone near the base unit due to bluetooth limitations but overall it's great."
1,Product breaks after 1 year,"I bought the ELBT 595 just over a year ago. Worked fine until a few days ago when the handset earpiece went dead. Uniden customer service told me that the handset speaker must have went out. The product is 3 months past warranty so they wouldn't do anything for me, except suggest I buy a new handset for $100! An expensive phone that lasted just over a year."
1,what a waste,"bluetooth is nice, but everything else is a fiasco on this phoneone classic example:caller id doesn't insert a ""1"" before area code of long dist numbers, so when you go to save it it doesn't workI know what you're thinking, just add the ""1"", but that's another problem, you can't edit a numberfinally, b/c of this issue it doesn't correlate names/numbers from CID with your ABthis is pathetic for such an obscenely expensive phoneAnd don't even get me started on navigating the answering machine messages"
2,Avoid this one,"I've had this phone for about a year now. While the CellLink sounds cool (and does work ok), the phone system itself is not up to par.The handsets feel cheaply made, and just done feel ""right"" in my hand. Battery life in standby and talk time is very short for my expectations - I always need to ensure the phones are in their cradles charging.Controls/UI are ok - but some options (speakerphone mute on the base station and speaker volume on base station for example) are UI menu items and not buttons. The full keypad for the base station is nice.Sound is awful on both ends of a conversation during landline operations. I find myself using my cell phone (without CellLink) more often than not. Range on the handsets isn't on par with previous phones I've had.As soon as the new Panasonic DECT 6.0 line is out, I'll be replacing this system."
4,Even survived the washing machine,"This system is one of the more stable phone systems I have owned. I am able to easily get a day's worth of conference calls (5+ hours) with out recharging. Pairing to my blue tooth enabled phone is easy and works as advertised. Does not interfere with any of my electronics including WiFi.The handset seems solid to me however the buttons are a bit flimsy. The biggest test was when I ran the handset through the washing machine by accident. After pulling the battery and letting it dry throughly, I re-installed the battery and it continued to work.The biggest current issue is the cost for additional handsets seem high in this day and age."
1,Don't buy this phone before touching and feeling it,"No doubt, this phone has lot of features. I was waiting for this phone to come since Feb. Its photos and all look very pretty. But, when I went to see this phone physically in a store, I was really repelled by the cheap quality material used. This phone really looks like a kid's toy and that too from some one dollar shop. Needs lot of improvements in the design, aesthetics and material."
1,Don't buy this over-priced piece of junk,"This phone is designed to look like a cellphone and it even has features that look like they'd work like cellphone features. If you only need a facsimile and not useful features, this phone is for you. The fact that you can't edit caller ID numbers (like adding a 1) when you move them to the directory is astonishingly stupid. It seems like this phone was made by people who had seen cellphones but never used one."
3,Overall good functions - Flipphone Handset is poor design,"It's been 6 months and thought would post review. We have been using most functions including cell link, blue tooth, room monitor etc and overall phone is working fine. Excellent spreakerphone too.However our major complaint is flip phone desing. It is easy to to break the hindge (joint) just by opening and closing it. It seemsed like this thing never went through any solid testing. We reported to Uniden and provided the phone and they came back saying it's not covered under warranty. Now each piece of handset cost about 60-90 bucks depending if you want blue tooth or not.Also, handset does not provide caller name when it's closed. If you open the handset to see the caller name, you may end up connecting to caller. I think this could be changed but I wished that caller name should have been visible when handset is in flip down position. If they simply improve design of their handset, I would have given 4 star."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!!,"Very plastic feel. Very cheaply made for the high price. Had this phone for 3 months and the hinge broke just from opening and closing it. Sent it back to Uniden and after two weeks they send me a letter stating that the warranty doesn't cover ""physical damage"" and they want me to pay them $70 to fix it. I explain to them that all I did was open/close the phone and talk on it. They basically call me a liar and proceed to be very rude to me. I will never ever buy another Uniden product."
4,Good - But !!,"Overall this is a very good system relatively speaking.There is nothing out there that has the capabilities that this has.One of the it's shortcomings is the handset that is bulky in cell phone standards although it works quite well. And the lcd screen is terrible, it looks like a toy.But if things were better it may have cost a lot more. This lists for $300.00 and thanks to Amazon it's $100+.If you order an additional handset which I advise there is only 1 place and it's more than the price for the entire unit $139.00. But you can order a ""Like New"" from Uniden for $59But I had to send my 1st one back and am still waiting for replacement which they assured would be sent out Asp upon receiving the non-working handset.Lots of buts but as far as I know there is nothing better for what it does.PS - Bluetooth works great.........."
1,Disappointing,"The only good thing about this phone is the flip feature. I bought it so I could carry it in my pocket. The screen is not easy to read, almost seems out of focus. Every call includes an echo/repeat sound. But the worst part is even if you don't use the phone, the battery dies very quickly. I have two of these phones, and it's the same with both. Useless phone, good thing it was discontinued."
2,"Excellent concept, but erratic performance",My experience with the ELBT 595 is the same as many other reviewers here. The phone is way over-priced for the quality and performance. It works about half the time with my Motorola Razr. This is a novel concept but it appears to have rushed through the R&D; process. Perhaps the next version will be more sturdy and reliable.I have sold it and am trying another brand of bluetooth phone.
4,"Great phone, Bluetooth not compatible with iPhone","I bought one of these recently for such a low price that I cannot complain. However, I have find through exhaustive troubleshooting that while the Uniden will pair with the iPhone via Bluetooth, it is never capable of dialing with the iPhone (3GS 32GB, in my case). There is little info on the 'net about this phone.Bottom-line: If the Bluetooth + Mobile feature isn't a dealbreaker for you, and you get it cheap, it's an awesome cordless phone."
2,Disappointing.,"I rate this opera soley on it's entertainment value, which is almost non-existent!The music is VERY boring and WAY TOO Modern. There is only one post-Turandot opera to get and that is Floyd's Susannah. Susannah is the most Accessable and beautiful of operas in the English language.Susannah is available on Amazon.com and I highly recommend it."
4,Better listening than watching,"The PBS telecast of Streetcar was excrutiating to watch, plodding and dull. But, when I spent some time with this recording, I was delighted by the beauty of the voices and the lovely if not profound music. Then, again, how often is opera profound? It may well be that this work will suffer on stage because it requires better actors than the singers can be or better singers than the appropriate actors can be. The music is fine. And, this recording is very sensuous. Worth a listen if not a look."
2,Deceiving picture,"The picture is deceiving. The hut that was sent says `Coco Hut' on it (which I was trying to avoid) whereas the pictured hut says nothing. The pictured hut has thin walls as opposed to the inch thick walls on the hut that was sent. The opening appears large in the pictured hut relative to the hut sent, but not knowing the overall size of the pictured hut this is a tough comparison to make. Nonetheless, the opening is small enough to make the hut I received useless for my hermit crabs."
1,Broke within a month.,"The lid developed a very tiny crack within a month, which makes the waterer useless since it can't get a seal and all the water gushes out immediately.Very disappointed with this purchase. A fairly expensive waterer like this should not break so quickly."
5,Good product,"Great durable, heavy duty waterer. Been looking for something that would last as long as the chickens. Metal doesn't last as it rusts out eventually. Also like the feature of the filling, where there is even a plug to cover the nozzle while flling, makes it a lot easier not having to lug forty pounds of water while filling it up, very easy to use, I recommend it to anyone wanting a well thought out and well made product."
3,nice photos,"Great pictures, and the projects look fun to do. Some are more realistic than others. The tea-light holders weren't as easy as it looks, but still fun. If your house is earthy, these projects will fit in. A lot of the other projects were for people with serious time on their hands, but we've got to have goals..."
4,4 1/2 stars,"As others have noted, the quality of the production is lacking and the music is not just a little nerve shredding, but the volume of techniques is considerable, which isn't always the case with MA DVDs. Kris Wilder is a wonderful martial arts teacher who has put out some fantastic books, as well a highly polished DVD titled The Way of Sanchin Kata: The Application of Power.Sensei Wilder knows his stuff and it shows in this DVD. He doesn't talk in it at all, but simply shows slow and fast versions of 121 goju techniques from the system's many kata.This is a fine DVD for the goju stylist and other practitioners of traditional martial arts.Loren Christensen author of FIGHTING THE PAIN RESISTANT ATTACKER and a bunch of others."
3,Review,"This cord is OK, not great. Doesn't stay plugged into the computer well, slips out quite frequently. Also, much shorter than the original that came with my computer.It will have to do for now."
4,Hoping second time around is better,"This is the second time I have ordered the product. No issues is receiving the product. I had to buy a second one when the first one broke. Since it is for my sons laptop, I do not know if it was misuse by my son or a faulty product. We will see how the second one works out."
1,Gets insanely hot within minutes,This adapter gets insanely hot within just a few minutes of plugging it into the laptop and outlet. It also started making a slightly whirring noise which makes me think something might blow.
4,best price - works great,"I am not a big Windows PC fan, but I thought it was time to get that old laptop out of the closet and see what the real problem was. It was the battery and the power supply. I looked online and saw that Toshiba replacements didn't have a good rep, so I opted for this AC adapter instead. It's worked great so far and has fairly long cords and a sturdy, 90 degree plug that goes into the back of the computer... MUCH better. No noticeable heat. Time will tell though. Shipping was right on time."
2,Not as pictured,"Item is not at all like the picture. It's a canvas type material with a square in the middle full of small beads. Had to tie wrap it to even make it look like a penalty flag and the ""ball"" part isn't ball like. Waste of money."
2,Not Very Useful - Poor Quality,The material that this item is made of is stiff plastic. It isn't soft and doesn't conform easily to the shape necessary to make it real useful. There is also no obvious way to tie this off to make it the right shape for use (I used a rubber band).
3,Very stiff,I needed to replace one my husband had lost. This one was very stiff material. Not as soft and playable but does the job
4,Professional grade,"It's a pretty high end flag. A little stiff at first, but they wear in pretty quick. No rubber band though. Otherwise would have been a 5 star."
5,Great gift idea for the football enthusiast!,"My dad absolutely loved this gift! Before I gave him this flag, he would throw anything on the floor when the refs made a bad call against the Broncos. A red or blue bandana or white hanky just doesn't have the same appeal!"
2,Kirkbride Still Best Value--,"When I purchased another Thompson recently as a gift, I looked at this particular Bible. Unlike the preacher reviewing earlier, I have found Nelson Bibles to be either overpriced or quite lacking in quality. This Bible is of obvious higher quality than their usual line, but nothing to justify Nelson's price. The quality of construction is no better than Kirkbride (Thompson's original publisher) at a much dearer price. I agree with other reviewers that the paper is not of a quality expected for this price range, either.For this price one can buy two Kirkbrides, one to keep and one to give. My oldest Kirkbride Thompson is nearly 30 years old and is still in regular use. It's the only 'daily' Bible I've got that age that hasn't required a re-binding!"
1,The Review by A Kid's Review is Wrong,"A Kid's Review is wrong. This was NOT recorded in the late 60s, but rather in 1975. I would never have ordered it had I known this is Sills in 1975---- big, big difference in the state of her voice, as she herself acknowledged."
1,no libretto,"If you're ordering this particular recording based upon a need, want, yearning to have the complete libretto order not. I ordered this recording simply for that fact: it was promoted ""as including the 'libretto'"" which is exactly what I was looking for. While I'm sure the recording will be lovely, the fact that it marketed itself with expectations it did not deliver makes one weary from ordering online sight unseen."
1,reviewing nothing,"It is difficult to describe this item - difficult because it never arrived.DVD Legacy were supposed to have it in my hands by a certain date.That date has passed by almost two weeks. OK, it never arrived; perhaps there was a reason. But there was also no communication of any kind from them regarding out of stock/unavailability/unavoidable delay/whatever-type probems.Even after, at Amazon's urging, I wrote to DVD Legacy - and was assured that I would be hearing from them, I never did.Caveat emptor - Let the buyer beware.The one star in the review is because there was no option for zero."
1,Problem Now solved,"I purchased an external 300 GB hard drive from this company a couple years back and have been annoyed by a ""Reminder"" message every day since. For weeks, I contacted their support team, who answered promptly, but was unable to solve my simple problem unless I purchased a ""new"" license. This notice came after I had already paid over $300 for their product. I hate to give a negative complaint, since their product does what it was purchased to do, but DO NOT BUY CMS Products unless you don't mind being annoyed for the rest of your life with their pop-up window reminders and a support team that is incapable of solving even the smallest of problems. Buyer Beware!NOTE: Just after writing this review the CMS support team kindly sent me a ""free"" copy of the software needed to correct the problem. I would like to re-state that the product in question is doing what it is supposed to do deserving a much higher rating that the original 1 star that I gave it while the problem existed."
4,Acres of Aspiration,I got this book from the library and it is a excellent book for studying and learning about Black history. I could hardly put this book down after I started reading it. It had some very interesting facts in it and I had to buy this book to highlight these facts.
4,Higher Expectationa,"Growing up with the Moffatts since their first appearance on Sally Jesse, I still remember the great music they played between their country and pop phase. While this CD is MUCH better than Chapter One, I know that the boys can still do much better. I would consider this one of their better albums, but not the best they could have done.Whatever happened to the unrecorded versions of Sayin' I Love You (the recorded version flushed it!), Ya-Ya, and See the Light. Or how about their covers of End of the Road, I'll Be There for You, and Jumpin' Jack Flash? If you can remember the summer of '97 then you know what I am talking about."
5,Awesome CD,"This isn't my account, it's my bro's. I just got this CD. The Moffatts have matured GREATLY in this album. It's got a bit of English rock mixied into it. It's not all poppy love songs. It's more along the lines of ""frustration"" and ""Over the Rainbow"" than Girl of My Dreams and such. The lyrics are more diverse and so are the topics. It is the best cd they have made yet."
3,Still Not There,"I just got the cd and was quite disapointed after reading and hearing all the hype about their new cd. Yes, Their image has changed but their music is still basically the same. I think they have improved quite a bit but on some of the songs it seems the lyrics and the music don't mesh together as they should. They still have a long ways to go till they reach that level in music where they want to play at(and I want to listen to) Ultimatly, If you liked their previous album you should be quite satisfied with this one. O,and the best song on the cd is Spy ;) Maddie"
5,musical prodigy's,"wonderul album i thought this album was their best not only because they sound incredible but because they also wrote most of the album....they wrote Just another phaseCalifornia w/ bob rockAlways in my heart w/ john shanksTypical w/ john shanksWalking behind w/ bob rockAntifreeze and areoplanes themselvesI dont want you to want me w/ the bermans & jeff c.Life on Mars w/ Taylor RhoadesCall the doctor w/ bob rockSpy themselvesMy fav moffatt Dave sang lead on 4 songs, scott lead on 5 songs clint lead on 2 songs and bob lead on 1 song.their are two artist's that i cant live without their music and those areThe Moffatts & Hansontwo genius bands i cant tell you my fav because i like them both the same but they are so much different i think hanson is more soulful and the moffatts are more edgier rock new age type of stuff.hope this review was helpful"
4,Fantastic,"I love the game, and was so glad I got it at a cheap price. What is even better is that It works perfect. I like my old school games and Game Gear is my favorite hand game system and finding games can sometimes be hard on the wallet, but this was a good find."
5,"Captivating, intelligent and a darned good read.","Amily Dickinson's line ""I dwell in possibility"" echoed for me as I read this beautifully-crafted biography. Freya Stark saw possibilities where others apprehended obstacles; her ability to seize opportunities for adventure and to record her unusual experiences with intelligence and wit not only saved her from the conventional life of a spinster, but provided her contemporaries with fascinating information about about a part of the world they understood poorly. Her readers and listeners were mesmerized by what she had to tell them. Jane Geniesse's great achievement is that like Stark, she is able to convey a great breadth of learning and observation in a way that is entirely entertaining. This book has taught me a great deal more about Freya Stark, the Middle East and modern European history, but I seem to have no bruises to show for it! Thank you, Ms Geniesse!"
2,There ought to be a law,"There ought to be a law against an author writing a biography of a person whom she doesn't really like, respect, or understand. According to Geniesse, Freya Stark was a homely, erratic opportunist who could never commit herself to a loving relationship. The only good thing I have to say for this book is that it has encouraged me to read Freya's own words. Having started now with ""The Valley of the Assassins,"" I now see how utterly Geniesse missed Freya's humor, compassion, and intellect. If you're interested in the life of an incredibly perceptive, funny, and courageous adventurer, and would like to learn something about what the Middle East was like a generation or two ago, my own recommendation would be to give this book a miss and head straight for Freya Stark's own writings."
4,An excellent biography; reads like a novel,"A fascinating book, especially in the light of the current activity in Iraq and the rest of the Middle East. Many of the observations she makes about the culture, the great religious divides, and the inclination of the West to intervene to try to provide stability and leadership in the region are as true today as they were in the 1920s and 30s. The rifts that exist between the various Muslim sects have histories that date back hundreds of years, and are the same ones that continue to cause so much tension today. Besides the historical content, it is entertaining and inspiring to read about Ms. Stark, a woman who despite her insecurities, unconventional upbringing, and lack of formal education, went on to become a leading expert and advisor on Middle Eastern affairs. Better than fiction...it is all true!"
4,Some reservations,Don't read this book if you'd prefer your heroine not to have feet of clay! The author has dredged up every romantic misadventure and character flaw from Freya Stark's voluminous correspondence and interviews with those who knew her. Its also very weak on her second 50 years when less gossipy material was available. Fascinating reading but it doesn't do justice to Stark's foresight in predicting the course of Arab/Isreali relationships.
1,"One of the most biased, unsympathetic biographies written!","Freya Stark led an amazing life and deserves honorable recognition for her illuminating work, not a deprecating biography by an author who never knew her. This book is full of social messages and tries to incorporate a liberal agenda into the life of an extraordinary woman. Too much attention is paid to meaningless nuances. For example, the author repeatedly implies that Freya Stark was an ugly woman. This is simply not true. Sure, she may not have been stunning but it is clear that she was average and by no means homely. The author seems to have no respect for this great woman and it makes this book difficult to appreciate."
2,Disappointing,"I will simply say that I agree with the 1 and 2 star reviews. While the nomad may have been passionate there is no passion evident in this biography. From reading it I almost don't like Freya Stark or want anything more to do with her. I will read one of her own books, in her own words, and see. This book is a lackluster bio, nothing comes through with passion and beauty. It seems rather clinical and very dry. Freya's life just had to be more exciting than this. Buy the book used only but I'd avoid it and go for Freya's own words. There is no comparison to this book and the book Desert Queen."
3,A fascinating historical landmark,"The book offers a well-researched and - presented insight into the life a remarkable woman who had a passion for the region we know as the Middle-East; who lived amongst the people in the region and observed their way of life and worldview with an open mind and with immense humanity, an attitude uncharacteristic of her compatriots."
4,Monsters resurrected,"This is an interesting series about prehistoric Mega Beasts. Alot of the information is based on science, but some is speculative. Graphics and reconstructions are good. Experiments with recreated fossil, metal robotic, body parts, is cool and shows what the animal might have been able to do. All behavior of a prehistoric animal is speculative, but each episode gives some good examples of possible behavior. Information on the Mosasaur in T-Rex of the Deep is very good. There are five episodes: Terror Bird, T-Rex of the Deep, Biggest Killer Dino, Great American Predator, and The Great Ripper."
1,Boring and repetitious,"Hard to take. The same information is repeated over and over, practically word for word, several times during each program. On top of that, the same CGI dinosaurs scenes (mediocre at best) are also shown over and over and over, ad nauseum. The BBC program ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" is much more educational, interesting and worth the money. Leave ""Monsters Reurrected"" on the shelf if you see it -- you'll miss nothing, unless you need a sleeping aid."
2,Very poor,The ocean episode was good - the other two were gawdawful and stomach turning. How many times did we gave to see the same animal slaughtered over and over? They forget kids love to watch dinosaur documentaries and don't need to see the same blood splattering constantly - makes its point the first time.
2,worst show ever!,this show gives bad info about the creatures and it has the worst cgi ever.if you want my advice get walking with dinosaurs.I KIND OF LIKE THE SPINOSAURUS EPISODE EVEN THOUGH ITS INACURATE.
1,Worthless,"Product does not work. I have the hand held Petsafe Ultrasonic Pet Trainer which works very well at stopping dogs from barking. I bought the Bark Smart Deluxe to automatically stop the barking but it has absolutely no effect. Even when I press the test button to force it to transmit, it has no effect whatsoever. I had to go get my Petsafe product to get them to stop barking. The Bark Smart Deluxe is now in the trash can."
1,only works for a little while,"I had one dog that barked a lot and I didn't want to take other more invasive actions like shock collars, etc. So I tried the Ultrasonic dog bark deterrent. This only worked for about 3 days. It worked by startling my dogs. I could see that it startled them when they started barking. But once they were used to it, it didn't deter them anymore. I still have the unit but won't try to sell it because I don't think it's worth anything and since I would not recommend it, I won't sell it to anyone either."
4,Early album by Brazilian pop star Elba Ramalho,"""Alegria"" (1982) is an early album by Elba Ramalho, a pop star from Brazil's northeastern region. The repertoire comes from many of the best northeastern pop-rock composers of the early 1980s.Songs include:01 Essa alegria (Lula Queiroga)02 Dominó (Zé Ramalho)03 No som da sanfona (Kaká do Asfalto - Jackson do Pandeiro)04 A casca do ovo (Luiz Gonzaga, Jr.)05 Chego Lá (Alceu Valena)06 Amor com café (Cecéu)07 Olhos acesos (Salgado Maranho - Zé Américo)08 Sete cantigas para voar (Vital Farias)09 Marcha regresso (Édison Luiz - Paulo Souer - Moraes Moreira)10 Menina do Lido (Carlos Fernando - Geraldo Azevedo)11 Bate corao (Cecéu)(DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
4,A Classic!,"Sooo much happens in this book. It's definately rainy day reading. Alpha males storms the castle, claims all, and enslaves the Lady. An intense historical romance that's sure to offend many ..."
5,Darkwing Duck,Great old school Cartoon.if you have a child I'm sure they would love this cartoon.My husband love this.
4,darkwing duck vol 2,i grew up in the 90s watching darkwing duck. it was funny cartoon. i really enjoyed it. i bough darkwing duck vol 1 + 2
4,I love this series,"Let's Get Dangerous!!I've been a major Darkwing Duck fan since the day it first came out on TV, and was always in a hurry to rush home to catch the next thrilling episoded of the series. *lol* I'm glad to see Disney is FINALLY put it out on DVD, but blast it!I wish they would put it out on DVD in ORDER instead of putting episodes from different seasons out of order on each disk! *pouts* I want to watch them in the order I remember it, and see characters like Liquidator, Negaduck, and the electro guys secret origins, or even the episode where Goslyn goes into the future and meets the now homicidal daddy DarkWARRIOR Duck, who went crazy in the years she was missing while she was away time traveling. *lol*"
3,An Ok series,"I was too old for most of these Disney cartoons from the 1980s-1990s. But I have purchased several for my daughter, like Duck Tales, Tail Spins, ect, and figured this one would be more or less like the others.It is, in the general format sense. But I have not been as impressed with this series as the others. Maybe it is a generational thing, but I am just not as crazy for Darkwing Duck as the other series. My daughter seems to enjoy them just as much and I have no trouble recommending them, but as a dad who has to sit through them sometimes, I do not plan to buy any more than season 2, which I bought at the same time as season 1."
5,Excellent,Excellent product. Dvd is exactly what it says on the box. Darkwing Duck is just as fun as I remember from my childhood.
4,Great Poster,The poster looks fantastic and I received exactly what I was promised. Love the move and love the look of this poster. A great addition to my home
4,Victorian Pansies,"A beautifully photographed book, more of a picture book than a 'how to'. I found that it was overly long in the project explanations pages, and sometimes they seemed too complicated to read right through. There are about 20 projects, nicely illustrated and all using the embroidery features found on the latest computerized machines, and the author's Pansy disc. Some supplies are hard to find in this country and no substitutes given for US readers. The book is written by an Australian artist. Overall I would say this is a pretty book for one's collection and an asset if one is charmed by the lovely flower, the Pansy."
4,I'm 13 year old,"I read this book an it was extiting and end was cool and the book was more beter than I thougt it would be when I frist pick it up because before that I had it for 3 years with out reading and then I faily read it and it it was funny, lil scary, mysterius, a lil fansty. And I recomand to anybody but mostly 9-14.It was rel good book and I was very happy with it :)"
3,This story is okay...Michael,"I think this is a great book for younger kids because it is not that scary, so it's okay. My favorite part is when they are in the basement. The book has a lot of imaginative details and some interesting facts. I think the book has a lot of information. I like the characters Lizzie and Booker. I think Lizzie is funny because she calls Booker a Booger. The setting is a floating house, could it be Lizzie's house? The problom is they are trapped by the witch. Read to find out what happens!"
2,manditory reading,"I got this as a gift only so that I could listen to a bunch of records that belonged to my dad and grandparents. Everything worked well except for the cd player which wouldn't play most of the cd's that I put into it but that didn't bother me that much because I only used this thing to listen to my records and I already have another stero. After about a year or so of having it, it stopped working and just died, which sucks because it had one of my cd's in it at the time so now I can't get it out. The waranty had already expired so I just let it sit in my room looking pretty, because that's all it's good for now.Now I don't know if I just happen to get the one crappy one or if they're all like that but either way I am very unhappy with it and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,stick to the plan,"I used this book extensively on a recent trip to Brussels, north to Gent, over to Brughes, up to Antwerp and into Holland via Amsterdam. With the exception of one night, all hotels were booked using their referals. Exceedingly helpful in all respects."
3,Not too complete,"I wasn't too impressed with this guide.Now that I have bought it I don't think it's a good idea to put together three countries as small as they can be. I have been living in Belgium for a year now and can tell that there is a lot more to see and do that the book says. This guide only goes for the main things but it would be nice for once to have some off the tracks hints and do something different. There are so many little towns in Belgium that are by far more interesting than some of the larger cities. The guide has a few good information to it. Especially for Liege, but frankly I would have likes to know more about some other towns. I also like guides that have a bit more history."
2,"Nice, but does not deliver","This was a nice, quick read, but i was left unsatisfied. The writing style is very simplistic, and although whimsical at times, i found it too basic. Sometimes the book reads like a composition assignment written by a high-school kid. If you are looking for an account on elderly love, pick up _Spence + Lila_, by Bobbie Ann Mason. In that excellent novella, an elderly couple faces together the medical problems of Lila. That book made me believe that true love is possible!"
3,Stories were interesting,The stories were interesting about Mrs. Kennedy and her children.The recipes were ok but nothing great.If you like to have a cookbook that has stories in it then it is an interesting read.
5,A Truly Delightful Book,"I came home from a very trying day at work and found this book had arrived. I began reading it immediately and found it so interesting.You must read the text between the recipes to get the full impact. What a story. One can't imagine the life and times of these people, but Marta gives you a good idea.The recipes aren't that difficult and I'll be trying some soon. They are very healthy sounding.What is sad is to see all of the family pictures and to realize that so many of them are gone.They had a magical life with ""Madam"". Grand Jackie fits her best."
5,Delightful! Not just a cookbook,"This book is delightful! It is not just a cookbook. Through the eye of Ms. Sgubin, we get a glimpse of the life at Mrs. Onassis's household, from birthday parties, summer time in Martha's Vineyard or in Skorpios Island, winter in New York, and lunches with her friends. This book is an eye opener that sometimes the life or rich and famous is very much like ordinary people. Who knows that Mr. Onassis's favorite chocolate cake came from a mix!"
5,"A Great Book---Not only a cook book, but much much more.","Marta Sgubin's book is a loving valentine to ""Madam"", the late Mrs. Onassis. Not only does one enjoy the dishes which she so lovingly cares for. But we see the very real and personal side to Jacqueline Onassis, she was a real person with ordinary tastes and habits. Ms. Sgubin has created a very warm and perhaps, the best book on Jackie. We see her and her family as they saw themselves, as a family. She writes, not only as a gifted cook, but as a member of the family, with compassion and love. Well done! Erick Fortmann"
4,A book worth sharing,"I plan to pick up several copies of this book to give out as gifts... at first I was turned off by an apparent ""insider"" book by someone trying to capitalize off the fame of a celebrity... I looked further when I realized the book had actually been endorsed by the Kennedy family themselves. I read and collect recipes as a hobby - I started looking at the recipes and thought, hey, these are really good. Since bringing the book home I find myself taken in by the warm personal style... I usually don't like cookbooks that surround the recipes with a lot of chat... this book is a one-of-a-kind for me...and I find myself enjoying the narration as much as the recipes. I am glad to see so many readers feel the same. After reading the professional and customer reviews, I'm convinced that I will be buying several more copies for friends who will enjoy the book as much as I do."
3,lol sweet,i think this game got a little over rated it but it bad but it could be better but go for it if you like old fighting games
