5,Vastly superior to the Sony ICD-P28,"I bought the Sony ICD-P28, and was so dissapointed with it, I returned it for this Olympus DM-10. The sound quality is excellent (while the Sony was horrible). The only problem i have is that the software is a little tricky, especially for dictation. However, it does download to .wma files which is good, because these are easy to convert. Furthermore, Olympus has a good amount of accessories you can get from their website i.e. a clip on mic, a phone mic, etc.). I take this recorder with me everywhere, and I record a lot of conversations I have. It's a lot of fun, and I love it."
2,"Beware, DSS is Olympus proprietary format, not a ""standard""","Yes, the features of this machine are nice, but the DSS format's name ""Digital Speech Standard"" and Olympus's touting of it as an ""international standard"" are deliberately misleading. In fact, Olympus owns it and does not even make it available enough for software vendors to develop conversion software. There is no way to, for instance, convert a CD audio, or MP3, or any other audio file into DSS format in order to play it on the DM-10. If you buy the thing thinking you can load 10 hours of CD audio books onto it, you will find that instead you only get 1 hour (in WMA format). And if you call Olympus to ask about it, their tech support people based in India will just tell you tough luck."
3,"battery lid falls off easily, owned since Sep 04.","So far so good, but one thing annoying is that the battery lid opens by itself easily, don't know why.. and how to fix it. Also, sometime when I put it in my pocket, on my, it plays automatically, that's embarassing.."
4,disappointment,I had to cancel the purchase from Amazon because it didn't arrived in time. I needed the item as I was leaving town and it was not shipped on the date indicated. I had to purchase the item from a store.
1,impossible,My husband wanted to record some childrens stories for our daughter's school. He has recorded things in the past but not on a digital recorder. We tried 3 models by this manufacturor and returned each one. Impossible to follow directions. Even went to Best Buy geek who also couldn't figure them out. I think it's an example of outsourcing gone bad. Obviousely what ever couuntry wrote the manual couldn't translate to English. Quite a disappointment. Unfortunately he's back to cassette and microphone...
2,"Worked great, but support from Olympus is lousy","Went bad (recording with heavy static and clicking noises) within warranty period. Sent in for repair. Waited 3-4 weeks, got unit back from Olympus still having the original problem!! What does Olympus say? ""Just send it back in again..."" They offer no better support than that. They said I have to send it in 3 times before they'll send me a new one. I wish someone else made recorders with these features, but competition is limited."
3,vitamins,Purchased these vitamins for my sister. The price was okay but feel it is better to buy locally. As far as the product itself I would recommend anyone to take these-of course with Drs. ok
5,Acidophilus purchase,"Shipped quickly,costwise. Living in a small town it is hard to get items when the store runs out, so I resort to online."
2,Spacey Entry for Snoopy,"As much as I love Peanuts and Snoopy, I almost passed this ornament by. But the collector drive in me took over again. Darn lack of self-control.I don't mind the details of this ornament. Snoopy is standing on some planet planting an American flag. Woodstock, wearing little green alien ears, is sitting in a crater. My first thought is this is Mars and Woodstock is supposed to be a Martian, but the dirt Snoopy is standing on is light enough I wonder if he is on the Moon.Either way, this is the most disappointing ornament in the series. It's not even timed to commemorate an anniversary. The details are good, but it just seems out of place for Peanuts and Christmas. Are they this desperate to continue the series?"
4,Great Read for those interested in an in-depth history,"This book and its companion, Count Frontenac & New France Under Louis XIV represents one of the US's first great histories. Detailed, but lively written with only a few give-away phrases to let the reader know that this history was written over 100 years ago, these 2 volumes are a must read for any serious US/North American history buff."
3,DVD just like the video,"While most DVDs add something special to the disc, this one has nothing new to add. Both the video and DVD have some entertaining clips of Theda Bara, Marlene Dietrich, Clara Bow, Pola Negri, Ingrid Bergman, Marilyn Monroe and others, but, unfortunately, the cuts between the Love Goddesses are obvious, as if the producers have done a quick job of putting all the actresses on a list and then splicing from one actress to another, without rhyme or reason. That's a shame because the subject is interesting. Still, if you love to watch some fascinating footage and will forgive the sudden shifts from one actress to another, you will enjoy ""The Love Goddesses."""
4,marketing under a new light,"This is a very good marketing book. It's very well written and sees marketing as a function which has effects on all the company so that it may hopefully acquire a 'marketing mindset'. Some parts take inspiration from Chan Kim's Blue Ocean strategy but the graphs are confusing and unclear. I will use it as a main textbook for my BA marketing course in college. Efficient, effective and enjoyable.Sergio Ianni[...]"
1,Obtuse,"This is so buzzword laden, I really couldn't make out what the guy was driving at. I abandoned it midway through the first chapter."
2,Staggeringly dull and pedestrian,"The pictures are fine, but the captions leave everything to be desired."
1,"Ceci n'est pas comme ""comme des garcons...""","One can only assume that the author of this book felt that (s)he also had the genius touch and creativity of Comme des Garcons' Rei Kawakubo. Unfortunately this is not the case. The essay is pointless, dull, and without enlightenment. The photographs--reprints of Comme des Garcons publicity materials--do not describe, critique, or illuminate the fashion or design work done by Kawakubo or Comme des Garcons, a dubious artsy pose instigated by Kawakubo herself. Only Grace Mirabella's foreward and the one-page company history at the end offer anything of interest to those fascinated by Kawakubo's amazing and uniquely original designs. What a waste."
3,Japanese Art...,"I was so excited when I saw a book had been published about Comme des Garcons and I was so disappointed when I got it in my hands. The book is full of very ""arty"" photographs of the designs but so arty that one can not even really see the clothes!I have almost every book in the Universe of Fashion series and they are all superior in every way to this one - I was really sad about this as I LOVE Japanese design...therefore I still have to give it at least 3 stars."
4,A great companion to the clothes.,"It has often been said that Rei Kawakubo and Comme des Garcons have straddled the fine line between fashion and art since Rei started Comme des Garcons in Tokyo in 1969 (it became a company in 1973 and debuted in Paris in 1981).This book, while not containing much in the way of text, serves as a wonderful companion piece to the fashion of Comme des Garcons. Particularly Cindy Sherman's works incorporating the clothes from the 1990s. It demonstrates that CdG is not just concerned with the clothes but the whole creative picture including advertising and invitations.The essay is also well informed and insighful.Great stuff."
4,A great toy after Halloween,"My son begged for this costume and he loved it--it is not durable nor are the toys quality (they are plastic) but he and his brother played with it all weekend! I like that the velcro does secure all the extra pieces quite well--we did not lose a single piece while out trick or treating-and the helmet was fun-but not big enough to strap on. Hence, the 4 star review."
4,My son loved it,"I did not order this on amazon, My husband bought it at party city. His 20 year old brother went with my 10 year old son (the one who used the costume) at Halloween It was very durable and he came back with ALL of the pieces. BUT the flashlight wasn't put on properly so it fell off. I am happy they found it. It holds the equipment very well but you need to put it on precisely."
2,Not great construction,I ordered two chairs. They look nice but they are mostly glued together. One completely fell apart the 1st time it was sat on.
1,Chairs are not safe,WE purchased 6 chairs and 2 broke almost immediately. They are made with wood dowels that break when the chairs are used. These chairs are not safe and do not recommend them.
3,Great Read on Local Interests,"James Lomuscio has written a thorough and interesting history of one of the most beautiful areas in the country. As a resident of CT whose daily commute covers the area that he discusses in his book, there were several ""WOW"" moments in the book where content really hit home. A must read for everyone in Fairfield County, CT (and everywhere else) who cares about open space.The book would have been greatly enhanced by having a decent map in it. I read it while I was on vacation and was wishing I had my Hagstroms map with me, the map he included was so small I had to use a magnifying glass!"
3,Interesting local history but where was the editor?,"We live close to this area. The book covers a very interesting facet of local history in Redding, Weston, & Easton, Connecticut and addresses the continual fight for open space. However, I could not get past the numerous typos in the book! Where was this author's editor? The book started with a good chronological flow but then became repetitive and the story scattered."
2,Relatively worthless,"Although Biech makes a number of good points in her text here, the vast majority of it can be chocked up to common sense. The workbook fill-in forms are nice if you're the sort of person that is so unorganized that you need your hand held at every step, but in all honesty if you fall into that category you probably shouldn't be thinking about a consulting career in the first place. Unfortunately I feel like their primary purpose is just to take up space, and make the book feel longer and more useful than it really is. If you boil this ""quick start guide"" down to the few pages that are actually worthwhile, you wouldn't even have enough pages to fill a pamphlet. Look elsewhere."
2,For beginners in business,"The book was good and well written. But if you have been in business more then a year or two or you have some business skill this information is nothing new to you. I found it to mainly dealing with the basics. Anyone who wants to go into business or marketing or managment consulting will find this book not as useful. For computer consultinants who have no business experince, this is a great start."
2,Simple - Bordering Simplistic,"Too simple, bordering simplistic. I would have hoped for some deeper advice addressed to people who are assumed to be more sophisticated and lettered than the average person."
5,An Excellent Guide for all levels of Consulting!,"Elaine has answered so succinctly the many questions consultants have in an easy to follow format. The Consultant's Quick Start Guide contains ""how to"" information that is valuable and easily accessible. This book has an index that lists, by subject, everything a consultant would want to reference.Thanks Elaine, this book has become like a bible. It goes everywhere I go!!"
1,"I can't believe I paid for this ""book""","This is my first review of any Amazon purchase.This book is pre-basic. If you have no working knowledge of how even fundamental business is operated (such as opening up a checking account for business expenses), then you have no basis skill set to become a consultant...at least, not one that anyone will take seriously. This book could be wrapped up into one small magazine article in the back section of Glamour magazine."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This book is awful...a complete waste of time for anyone with half a brain...if you only have half a brain, feel free to buy it. It's overly simplistic, obvious, insultingly simple and unlikely to help a budding consultant make a dime. If you want REAL advise, pick up any of Alan Weiss's books."
5,Pro Strings with incredible tone,"I've been using D'Addario Pro Steel bass strings for many years now. They have beautiful, bright, singing tone, with all of the punch, mid-range, and clean highs that a bass player looks for. Can't say enough good things about these strings."
5,Required Reading,"Amazingly, this first time author just gets it so right. Told from the viewpoint of a born and bred Yuppie, transplanted Californian, master landscaper, father, husband, and son, the story becomes a pleasant surprise quite quickly. Feminine nuance and sublety and ever present guilt are humourously overacted. But important issues are tackled with the tongue firmly in the cheek. Certainly a bit over the top, but the exciting thing is that Househusband GETS IT. Lincoln (named after the car in his out-of-touch father's dealership) makes gentle suggestions for misbehaving children (Violet is spoiled, but she's mannerly about it), business affairs for the spousal unit, as well as dealing with a charmingly/alarmingly runaway mama of his own. And the icing on the proverbial cake are the yummy sounding, healthy recipes laced through the book. I'm thinking this should be required premarital reading."
2,The most obnoxious protagonist I could imagine,"I used to think it would be great to have a ""house husband."" But, my gawd, not if he were an obnoxious, egotistical control freak like this guy! I hated him from the beginning, and he never improved. I kept hoping he'd see the light, go back to work, and hire a nanny who would truly show the child some love and warmth."
5,Fantabulous!!,"This book is a scream! I honestly couldn't put it down and read it in a weekend! I went to high school with Ad, so it was wonderful to read it! Ad has always had a fabulous sense of humor. His writing style pulls you in as a part of Linc's family...anxiously awaiting what crazy thing will happen next. Ad, you've done a fantabulous job. We're all awaiting your next book. If you've not read this book, don't wait for the movie!! It couldn't be as good as the book!"
1,Had potential but couldn't live up to it,"The story line was an intriguing one and the writer has talent but the book got so bogged down with preachiness and whining that after a while it became a chore to read. It's nice that Mr. Hudler has gained some insight into women's lives but someone needs to tell him that he is not now nor ever will be a woman. And however well he (or the character in the book) might be at doing a ""woman's job"" of childcare and cleaning it still doesn't occur to him to do it the way women do, that is without constantly whining about how hard it is."
1,Horrible depiction of parenting,"I thought this book may have potential to be witty and filled with great observations from the other half (dad being primary care giver). It was a disappointing, whining, boring, ""soap box"" that made not only working mothers look bad, but also stay-at-homers and everything in-between! I had a very hard time finishing it, and then considered it a complete waste of time. This guy does more whining and complaining then both of my children on an eight hour car trip! YUCK - - -AND - It's easy to raise one child - I would love to see the character when number two and three come along!Good Luck!"
2,Lame !!!!!!!!!!,"I love R. L. Stine, and Christopher Pike. I had high hopes for this author, although I really haven't heard of that particular person before.. WITH GOOD REASON !!! Teen suspense in the 90s was at an all time high.. so books were coming out left, and right. I couldn't believe how bad this book was !! The author tried so hard to make the teens well.. teens but it was too ridiculous.. I couldn't imagine teens ever acting, or saying, most of the things that went on in this story. I wasn't the worst book i've ever read, but one of the most trash worthy !"
2,Just Like the Da Vinci Code - History + Fiction,"This book is written 100% from the perspective (and everything is perspective) of Trial Lawyers. Sad what passes for ""history"" these days. Interesting read - even an important read - but the spin in this book creates enough wind to cool a medium sized office building. Read, enjoy, but be smart enough to know that (just like the Da Vinci Code) you are getting a small helping of history, and a very generous serving of pure Grishamesque yarn."
2,Why can't a biography explain more of a man?,"""The Incomparable Rex"" is an entertaining, light read. But it is like eating too much dessert without a sustaining entree.Patrick Garland claims a decade worth of friendship with Harrison, and claimed to have found him charming. Yet nearly all his antecdotes display Harrison as self-centered and with an ugly tongue and temper.The reader naturally wonders WHY? This book does not attempt to answer this. There is no character exploration, only antecdotes [and long sentences - 12 lines or more! -- containing too many commas and subordinate clauses. I found it difficult to believe that Garland had been given an honorary doctorate in ""English letters"".]If you are satisfied with antcedotes and vignettes, this is the book for you. If you are interested in the man's life, and the whys of his life, this book will be a disappointment."
3,Great classroom resource,Excellent poetry book. The children in my class really enjoys the different styles of poetry. It was an excellent way to introduce new poets in a colourful way to the class. Thank you.
3,"Great selection, poor binding.","This book has a wonderful selection of poems, and my students loved the recordings. Unfortunately the binding fell apart the first day I had it in the classroom and this group happens to be particularly good with treating books gently. I will continue to use the C.D. but I might have to have the book rebound if I want to continue to use it with the recorded poems."
1,THIS PERSON HAD TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO CD AND THE PAGES WERE RIPPED,How do you sell a book knowing that the pages were ripped? not enough to write everything....never again. Not right
3,Good poems bad CD,"I got this book because of previous reviews and the CD. However, the CD is a big disappointment. The poems were read by a lot of different people, presumably, the writers. This has both up and down sides. Although the authors may understand the poetry better, some authors don't have a clear voice. Additionally, the CD has a pretty high background noise. It was as if the poems were read and tape-recorded at home and then pieced together by the producer. Otherwise, the poems are fun and my 4 year old son loves me reading the poems to him."
3,Not bad... but could be better,"It would feel more comfortable if it were a little heavier, especially for using it on paper (pen or pencil).As a matter of fact, I use it only for my PDA. I'm very accustomed to write with medium-heavy pens, so I feel this one uncomfortable weak and light. I must confess the name Platinum convinced me it had a metal body. Ugh!"
2,"Nice, but not what I was hopeing for.","I ordered this pen after ordering the Pacific Blue faceplate cover for my Palm m100. While I am pleased with the performace of the pen, it still looks like a cheap, blue, plastic pen. I wish I had saved my money for something else. If you looking for a professional and stylish pen, best move on."
2,Plan on calling the manufacturer,"Nice pen, got one for my wife and I several months apart and from two entirely different stores. Both came with non-functioning roller tips, but plenty of ink... Decent pen after you call manufacutrers, wait a couple of days, and install new ink cartridge."
3,Nice pen that came with faulty ball point refill,"I like the pen, except I can only use 2/3 of its functions. The ball point pen refill kept skipping. I have been looking for refills in stores (department, drug, stationery, book) and have been unsuccessful. The universal ball point pen refills that are available are actually too large for this pen. Oh, well--as a dual-function pen it's still good."
3,"Handy, but too light","Three types of writing utensils is invaluble. Some might like its light weight, but it made me feel like I was holding something disposable."
3,OK-ish,I was wondering what to expect when i started watching this movie BUT i can honestly say it was kinda ok.. It's like a sex movie for 19-24 year olds. It was cheesey yet you couldn't help but watch at times.. I would truly have given it 2.85 stars...
2,"One of those bad ""lets put young actors into a bawdy, medieval romp"" film.","While the film could have been an interesting big screen adaptation of the Casanova tale, with lots of young and up and coming actors and actresses, it falls into the trap of looking like modern day actors forced into these medieval roles. They just don't pull off looking like they should be in that time frame. Many, many comedic attempts have tried to go the bawdy romp route and failed, and this one is no different.For a much better movie, and similar theme, look no further than television and the British production (shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater) ofCasanova (Masterpiece Theater). It's a tremendously better play on the same plot, and you can see the production quality and performances are all a notch or two above this sophmoric, direct to DVD flick."
1,"Two Hours of My Life, That I Won't Ever Get Back!!!","This movie really bites! I thought that none of the ""actors"" could act and that this movie was poorly put together! It wasn't funny, entertaining or eye catching. I wouldn't even tell anyone I watched it that is how bad it is!This movie does not live up to it name or the hype you get when your firing up your DVD player. We were expecting some crude humor and a good laugh with this film and it brought neither!!I felt that this so called ""movie"" completely lacked a plot/storyline altogether!To bad on amazon I can't give ""0"" yes ZERO stars!Please, Don't waste your money or precious time on this one!"
2,Silly Movie + Nudity,"This is a silly 90 minutes movie that contains some (or a lot, depending on how you look at it) nudity to spice it up and keep the viewer watching until the end. Set in the Middle Ages in some place in Europe (it was shot in the Tuscany, Italy), this is the story of a young princess-wanna-be soon to be married with a Count from Russia. While she waits for her prince to come, other two gentlemen fight each other for her love. One of them (DARTH VADER) is confined to a convent of nuns where he is deaf and dumb and works as a gardener taking care of some very special 'flowers'. This movie is supposed to be funny, but like 'Step Brothers' that I watched at the movie theatre a week ago, I did not find it to be very funny. Just a couple of jokes that may be good, and a lot of very beautiful faces. ""GIVE ME MY TREASURE! GIVE ME MY TREASURE!"" Recommended for teenager minds. Rated R for nudity."
3,Funny and Sexy...,"Folks, please don't expect too much from this lightweight sexy comedy that reminded me a little of Pasolini's Decameron. Hayden Christensen is passable as the object of the love starved 'virgins' and is worth watching while you do some other task, like plucking a chicken. Rent instead of buying; I don't think too many would care to see this twice."
2,WASTE OF TIME,"Ok, some of the shots in the movie are good and sexy but the whole movie is full of baloney. Stopped it within 30 minutes of play."
1,"""I'm Not A Child, Or A Cucumber""","To be completely honest and absolutely blunt I say without reservation that the '07 film 'Virgin Territory' is an insulting, adolescent tale of debauchery disguised as a period piece that plays more like a low budget '60's soft core film than anything else.There are numerous lovely young ladies in the movie more than willing to expose their ""treasures"" so I'm sure the film will find an appreciative audience amongst teenage males but otherwise it's a complete waste of time.If you're of Catholic orientation you'll find this one especially insulting so look elsewhere for entertainment. Trust me on this one."
2,"This movie is a mess, but the ladies make it a bit easier to get through it","When will casting directors learn that Hayden Christensen can't act? I've never seen him turn in a decent performance. The Virgin Territory plays for laughs most of the time, the only problem is, it's not really funny. Tim Roth seemed to be having a good time as the villian, but even he couldn't twist the lazy writing and make it appealing.The only saving grace are some beautiful women that don't seem to be too shy when it comes to showing skin. There isn't even enough of that to make this film worth watching. I've seen plenty of worse flicks, but I can't imagine anyone really liking this one."
4,Worth a Watch,A light comedy from Darth Vader himself. Not really an action/adventure squashbuckler...more on the comedy/drama side of things. I like it...though i would probably not watch it again.DVD picture quality is very good on my HDTV 1080p 120 Hz frame rate. Audio flickered out a couple of times from the movie (don't know if its from my DVD copy or not).
2,Beautiful Maidens that lose wardrobe,"I checked this movie out because of the cast,always enjoy Roth & Christensen's good and I had hoped to get a better look at Mischa Barton than the O.C. provides. While the movie is full of beautiful women and the R rating allows many Lovely maidens to lose their costumes,I'm guessing that Barton's waiting for a bigger movie to drop the duds,alas.While it's not the best movie I've seen this year,there was beauty to be seen and a couple slight chuckles (Mathew Rhys was amusing)and I thought better of the 97 minutes I spent here than some of the other things I've seen recently (naked ladies help!)"
1,One Question...,"OK, just one question, how does Hayden Christensen ever get any work. This has to be the most awful actor in all of Hollywood. OK, if you have to deliver stiff, Lucas-speak, then maybe he's your man, but in anything else, he's hopeless. Think Nicholas Cage without the charisma.With that said, I don't think Michael C. Hall (Dexter) could have rescued this disaster. Someone mentioned that they were going for the Heath Leger vibe, but that doesn't help. It is too period for the ""Porkys"" crowd, and too raunchy for the intelligent crowd.Don't defile your DVD player with this disk..."
3,"Ok, but not great!","I also got this DVD because I like Hayden Christensen. I thought this movie sounded good and along the lines of Monty Python and Princess Bride. I thought the use of nudity was over done, maybe the maker wanted this to attract viewers. This is a common tale...the man who can have anyone falls for a woman who is pursued by a couple of suitors. I felt this movie was very thin and predictable in the plot. There is some enjoyment from the obvious skin, but beyond that the actors only do a marginal job in keeping the viewer watching until the end."
2,A Pretentious Waste Of Time!,"This movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy, loosely based on classical literature, but it is far from funny. In fact, it is very sad to see such a feeble attempt at movie making! It begins with a very long, tedious narration which is supposed to be humorous, but isn't even close. I couldn't wait for the narration to end, but when it did, the dialogue wasn't any better. Everything is uniformly mediocre(that is being generous). Even the acting is lousy, which is surprising, since the cast is quite impressive. but that is what happens when good actors are given a bad script. If you think that the ""R"" rating will at least offer some stimulation, think again. Even that aspect is totally amateurish. The special features are more interesting than the movie, since they are not really scripted, so just watch them and skip the movie. Spend your time and money somewhere else!"
2,Bad,"Was a pretty terrible movie. I liked some of its narrative structure (the character who narrates was interesting, but never developed). Some reviewers seem to think it has a lot of T&A, but I don't think they were watching the same movie. I counted 3 or 4 scenes with nudity. In any case, the movie was pretty boring. The narrator character was far more interesting than the protagonist, which usually makes for a lame story, except maybe in some novels like Cárcel de amor. Bottom line is that I paid $8 for this movie, and it's not really even worth that. The characters aren't developed. There's nothing funny about it, and there isn't even enough gratuitous nudity to make the movie worthwhile."
3,something of nothing,A rather silly story grounded on clichés with factually misleading info exists thankfully for personal attractiveness of actor playing a major character.
3,movie review,"The first time you watch this movie you'll either love it or hate it...I have to say for what it is, it is OK if you know you just want a no brainer evening. It does a sense of fun without too much silliness or even a definite charm. Its not a true comedy (only having a good laugh twice nor is it a true action/adventure, not having that much action or adventure). It has its ""sexiness"" appeal, but it's all done in a spirit of fun... The costumes are great but I would neither give the movie a thumbs up or down...It'll be somewhere in the middle."
2,Don't pluck this vapid virgin off the shelf,"Vapid beyond belief.Pointlessly silly.Ridiculous to the extreme.Painfully farcical.As boring as watching wine age.Disappointing attempt at a period piece.Idiotic on the level of Jessica Simpson.As juvenile as a frat party.Insulting to any intelligent creature.I thought this would be a fun, light romp through history; a period piece with a little panache, but I was woefully wrong. This was just a stupid, sophmoric attempt at humor. As stupid as someone who giggles at the words ""pee pee, caa caa, poo poo, fart.""You would be much better off renting (or buying):RidiculeVatelThe Red ViolinDangerous LiaisonsColonel ChabertSave the brain cells!"
5,Great comedy,"This is a great romantic comedy with the flavor of 'Benny Hill'. Set in medieval times, it uses the twist of more modern music that makes the tone more upbeat. A young man, Lorenzo, is in love with Pampinea, but that doesn't prevent him from taking what a few nuns have to offer when Lorenzo must hide out from a maniac played by Tim Roth who is after Lorenzo's blood. A funny mix of swordplay, love and lust. I also enjoyed the bonus materials.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,Cavelli's costuming is the only star in this comedy.......,"I agree with the other reviewers-the maker's of Virgin Territory were obviously hoping to cash in on the popularity of ""A Knight's Tale"" and hoped a bit of added raunchiness would push this film to success. In the twenty something vernacular-NOT.The youthful portion of the cast were average at best, though just barely-and the otherwise great Tim Roth......well, he must have had a house loan due to star in this film. The only star that shined was the beautiful settings and the sumptuous costuming by designer Roberto Cavelli. Otherwise-it's not worth wasting 90 minutes on.Also a warning-even though this film stars young people, it's definitely not a film for the under 16 set as the sexual humor is very frank, so be forewarned.Just average-3 stars."
1,Rent it - don't buy it.,"I picked this because I love period films. But being familiar with the B level acting chops of Hayden Christensen and Mischa Barton, I did not set my expectations very high. This was in the same campy genre as A Knight's Tale but with more bawdy scenes and nudity. No big LOL moments but was ""entertaining enough"" to watch. Lots of eye candy and cheap laughs with predictable story lines. The costumes are not accurate, the modern rock music is very out of place but the scenery is beautiful. For me, this was light-hearted but not as delightful as say, The Princess Bride... and I can't say I will willingly want to watch it again anytime soon. This is more of a frat house rental movie."
1,Shameless self promotion with little actual use,"This book was a textbook for a course I took on documentation and policy writing. I used it as a reference guide for one of my projects, and found that it was practically useless. Half the content was the author promoting himself and his other books. The other half could have been summed up as ""use the internet to find examples of existing policies that you can copy."" Total waste of money."
2,not what I was expecting,I though I would find more detailed and practical information about how to write documents
3,Disappointing,"Predator and Prey got off to a great start in my opinion. Vampire and Judge, the first two in the series, were both great reads. The third book, Werewolf, was an ok read with the hope that maybe it was a ""setting the stage"" book and the series would go back on track. I thought this book was a more interesting story than the third and in that sense it was better than the last, but I'm really getting sick of the characters. They're still all wrapped up in the same place that they were in previous novels, leaving me wondering if they're going to spend the next several books whining and moaning and griping at each other and making self-destructive choices. But, as said, it's well written and an interesting tale for all that. As long as you can put up with listening to a bunch of poor me, no one understands, I'm the only one in the world with that problem... so on, et al. I can't, hence a mediocre rating."
2,Disappointing,"The P&P-series had a great start. P&P: Vampire and P&P:Judge were both two great books, P&P:werewolf was ok. This one ,unfortunately, is the worst in the series so far. The characters from P&P:Judge and P&P:Werewolf are here brought together. That is Douglas Sands, Kaitlin and Black Rindle. The book is filled with depressive social-realism. Kaitlin's perspective which was refreshing in P&P:Werewolf is in this book excruciatingly boring. If you are looking for horror and a plot with surprises, then don't read this book. Nothing that happens here is surprising.Contents? the wyrm, hunters vs werewolf, pregnancyLet us hope the next book brings this series back on track."
1,Poor customer service,"My friend Sandy gave me the BDM-4GT-U2 for my birthday a couple weeks ago. Today I decided to download a slew of jpegs from my PC to this new gadget. Halfway thru the download, I get a Windows message that the transfer is not taking place, and my data is LOST.I rebooted the PC, my PC does not recognize this new gadget. The only thing I have left, is this unoperable gadget that makes a scary whirring sound. When I called Customer Support, they wanted me to produce a purchase receipt. How many present givers give you a receipt. No dice, I told the lady, that I was going to make sure everybody nows about my problem."
3,Great book...,... but I just keep putting off reading the rest of it. I guess I'll finish it someday.
3,I've been meaning to read this...,"This book came recommended and the table of contents looks interesting. I've had it on my ""to read"" list for months now but somehow I never got around to reading it ..."
2,"Skip the Audiobook, Just Read It","I listened to an hour of the audiobook and found it quite unbearable. Not because of the content, which I was excited about, but because the reader was doing a terrible job at keeping me focused. Way too slow, amateurish, and he basically sounded like he wasn't familiar with the text at all (perhaps reading it for the first time?). Again, this doesn't say anything about the quality of the written version."
4,Very informative.,I didn't do many of the exercises but I did take away some good information and it has changed the way I think about things. I would recommend this to a friend.
4,The Now Habit,Very helpful suggestions and ideas. Well written and I would strongly encourage to read anyone who wants to overcome his/her procrastination.
4,Pretty good book!,"I'm not a usual reader of self-help books, but have been struggling with procrastination for awhile now. This book has given me some specific tools to deal with it, understand it, and not torment myself over it."
1,Fiore is a joke,"Fiore touts himself as an expert in psychology, but comes off as a snake-oil salesman. The book itself is an excercise in procrastination; it's like reading the text of a late-night infomercial. Fiore drones on about how useful the ""Now Habit"" is, but never gives a concrete explanation of what it is or how to acheive it. This book is poorly organized and lacks any sense of cohesion. I was looking for a technique to help me focus on tasks and projects through completion; ""The Now Habit"" did not deliver."
4,Nice book. You just have to PUSH YOURSELF!,"This is a great book. It's a very light, casual read that makes me feel relaxed reading it. I've had procastinating issues for my whole life, and I'll admit... even after reading this, I still get into that same old habit.It's good to read self-help books not once, but twice or even more than that to REALLY get the message stuck to your brain. Overall, this is a great book."
2,"Some good ideas, but so much filler","The principles are quite good, but there wasn't any silver bullet. Mostly a lot of common sense and some good concepts for programming yourself to rethink your time wasting / saving etc. It's the kind of advice you often hear from friends and work colleagues. So I never really learned anything new. At the very least it reinforced the advice.What always gets me with these self-help books is the sheer amount of filler and many case studies. You spend so much time reading all the cases that you actually forget the learning principles - I know the case studies are supposed to support the principles, but in this book it didn't work for me. After a while it just became a tedious read and to be honest I can't even remember finishing it - shows you the impact it had on me!For me, the ironic part is putting a tedious book with so much filler in the hands of a procrastinating person."
3,Some Great Insights But Lots of Filler,"This easily readable book really contains some gems of psychological insight into the root causes of and remedies for procrastination. Unfortunately, like many self help books, this key insights are packed inside pages of prosaic, predictably stale anecdotes about ""real"" people. I skimmed/ skipped though them all, and got through the whole book in about an hour and a half. All in all, it is definitely worth a read since it contains a few ideas that may really impact your life positively, but it would be better written as a 20 page pamphlet rather than a 150+ page book."
1,"Some helpful insights, but generally dangerous","I'm glad some people found this book helpful. But I frankly think this book misses the point and has the potential to seriously harm the productivity and psyches of people who need its help.My biggest complaint is with its mantra of ""play more"". ""Guilt free play"" cannot take place until one feels like his/her life is under control. By recommending that people walk away from their work while it is still under control, Fiore is recommending that people engage in dangerous denial.What people need is strategy for getting their lives under control. Fiore attempts to offer that at times, but insufficiently.If you want to get your life under control, I strongly recommend David Allen's Getting Things Done. It provides the strategic approach you need to get your life under control, so you can actually enjoy some guilt free recreation."
1,I didn't even finish reading the book.,"I found the book a little too much ""It's okay, you are still a good person even if you procrastinate"" in it's approach. I know I'm a good person, even though I put things off. What I wanted was motivation and ideas to get things done. ""The Now Habit"" didn't provide that, not even enough motivation to finish the book."
2,Procrastinating on Finishing the Now Habit,"I have only listened to about the first hour of ""The Now Habit"". I am not sure I can force myself to finish it. I am afraid to listen to it while driving - I might fall asleep at the wheel. Not sure if it's the author's tedious prose or the narrator's emotionless droning or a combination of both, but it is a painful listen. But at least I am glad to know that it's not my fault. I am not lazy or undisciplined. It was all caused by my parents.Recently I learned the ""Pomodoro Technique"" from a friend, and it has helped me in a short time to be more productive and to procrastinate less. I will certainly have to use it if I want to finish the unpleasant task of listening to this book!"
1,Kindle pricing - lost sale,"Based on the reviews and a personal recommendation from a friend I was going to buy the book. However the fact that the Kindle pricing is more than the paperback price really really really pissed me off. I will borrow the book from my friend or buy it from my local used book store. No revenue for the publisher or the author. None, nada, zip. If you can give me value proposition for paying more for an electronic edition then I might buy. But as a matter of policy I refuse to pay more for something that costs less to produce without some other kind of added value."
5,Whew! Finally! Someone who understands.,"This is the first book about procrastination that didn't leave me feeling like I had been beaten over the head with my ""flaws"". It was helpful to learn the reasons behind my procrastination, and to be given plans of action that make sense for those reasons. We are much more likely to grow through encouragement than through censure. This author's approach is esteemable."
4,not just about procrastination,"The book goes beyond how to deal with procrastination. It provides me a new philosophy of life, that is, choosing to do what I commit and never push myself into victimhood. The book does offer many easy and effective ""tools"" to deal with pressing procrastination problems, but most importantly, the book keeps telling us the procrastination is the result of underlying fear and anxiety, and I believe it's more important to understand and tackle the fear instead of fancy strategies of dealing just the symptom, that is, procrastination. By this I want to thank the author. The book sometimes repeats itself and becomes less organized, but overall it's very easy to read and implement."
5,This book and I have become good friends.,"This book greatly helped me to make it through residency. I used the principles again while studying for board exams (Internal Medicine). I now find that my weight-loss patients greatly benefit by using the techniques to stop procrastinating exercise.The most powerful tool is the ""Unschedule"" form he supplies with instructions. The Unschedule is one of the most ingenious techniques I've seen for getting arial view of the week and for guilt free play and multiple forceful starts on important projects.Best book on procrastination that I've read and in the top ten books on time management. I put this book on the list that will be required reading for my sons as they grow older.--Charles Runels, MD(...)"
5,Great foundational book: motivates you to finally complete what you want to each day,"This book was easy to read, but managed to delve deep enough into the complexities of procrastination to finally open my eyes and shift to a more productive - and satisfying - way of functioning. The insightful chapters are combined with good step-by-step concepts to implement, giving you room to learn and grow, knowing how to re-group when you backslide - because we are all perfectly human... I also got the audio version of the book, read by the author, and found it easy to listen to."
5,book purchase,Great book recommmended by an ex-boss. I have not finished the publication but so far it is awesome. Seller services were great thanks.
2,complete beginners only,"This book is a poor introduction to php / mysql.The way to programming proficiency is to understand small and simple scripts and use the lessons learnt to build your own programs. This book however gives pages of ready built scripts that take an age to work through and are too long to see easily (and I've built commercial sized php sites.)However, far worse than that is the omission of functions. It is simply impossible to ever progress at programming without understanding functions and this book doesn't even mention them.Get ""PHP and MySQL Web Development -- by Luke Welling, Laura Thomson"" instead. This is an excellent book, even if you are a beginner - it will give you a solid foundation in php and mysql as well as teach you sound programming techniques.Beginners may find it useful, but only on the understanding that you'll soon need another book."
5,Just the right blend.,"For what the book was intended to be, the essentials of PHP, I think the author did a wonderful job of writing this. It starts with basic HTML in case you haven't learned it yet, or need a refresher, then moves on to basic PHP and builds from there. The section that explains installing PHP, a webserver, and a database was extremely helpful too.Without trying to be too much, this book is just right for the essential knowledge you need to start programming PHP."
2,This book is one of those 50% off computer books...,"Essentially, this book teaches the basics, and thats about it.Don't waste your money. Buy Programming With PHP. It's just as basic, and you might actually be competent by the time you finish! Wow! Que bueno concepto!"
2,Early Bird Doesn't Catch the Worm,"This book is a classic example of an author/publisher rushing to be the first on the market to cover a new version of a programming language. There were some helpful portions, such as an abbridged function reference, but all in all, many other newer books cover using PHP, especially PHP 4, far better and in greater detail. Even the book's function reference is easily out done by the documentation on PHP's web site. I was quite disapointed."
5,Perfect For Me!!,"This was the book I've been looking for. Not pretentious. Didn't assume I knew anything. From reading the description and looking at the table of contents and the web site for the book, it looked like the perfect ""getting started"" book for me. And I did, and it was very fast. That's why I like this book and am giving it 5 stars: it met my expectations and did the job for me.There is a lot of stuff that isn't covered, but it wasn't ""essential"" (pun intended!!) for what I need to do now or for a long time.For a quick jumpstart into a new language, with a quick read and easy to understand examples, get this book! If you're a ""hard core"" programmer with years of it under your belt, you won't need this book. I did a lot of research: this author has a lot of information here and at the web site, and has already answered several of my ""help!"" e-mails - that's pretty great support, above and beyond the call of duty!"
3,A well written but beginner book,"Very basic but well written. Not many other alternatives out there yet. Was it worth the money - yes, I guess so but it leaves a lot to learn.Also, I'm not a SQL Server fan, but the Author makes the silly claim that MySQL is more powerful than SQLServer."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Installation directions don't work, many segments of code don't work. The Author makes many, many assumptions. For instance, that you can read her mind. She gives many examples of how to edit a file but never explains which file to edit. She will be talking about one file and skip to another file, telling the reader to add this line but she never tells which file she's talking about. It was maddening."
4,PHP Essentials ROCK!!!,"PHP essentials is a very good book. It is well written and easy to understand. However, if you do not have any programming experience, such as Perl, this is not the best one to get started. If you do have some experience in programming and understands how the web actually works, this book is excellent to develop your programming skills.I have a Perl background and use flat text file as a database. I wanted to transfer my entire site on PHP as a language and MySQL as a database system. Therefore, I purchased this book and a MySQL book and now, I am home free. Julie Meloni uses simple examples to help you learn PHP and you can actually build and manage your database, simply by reading this book. I strongly recommend this book and buying a MySQL book to go along with it.Finally, although this book has a favorite database system covered, MySQL, it does support other database systems such as SQL, Oracle, etc... If you want to use PHP with a database system, this is the book to get."
3,"Not for Programmers, Fast Read","This is not a book for programmers. Quotes like ""Commenting your code is a good habit to have,"" (pg.33) bring chills to a professional programmer (of course you comment your code!). The book is a one-hour read for anyone ever to write in a scripting language and covers, lightly, many topics in php programming including authentication and encryption. To write ""production"" PHP you'll need a meatier reference book. Overpriced for a cursory introduction to php."
2,Missing important points,"As a PHP newbie, but professional C++/Java/EJB programmer, I was really disappointed by this book mainly because it complitely ommits the Object Oriented (OO) aspects of PHP as well as common code reusability principles which are very important when building dynamic web sites. If you look for a reference for accessing particular aspects of PHP such as sessions, database access and so on, this book is for you, but if you want to go beyond and planning to use PHP professionally, you should buy another book."
3,"Great concepts, bad examples","Honestly the book tells the truth about php among other things. You'll get the know-how on making a web server and compiling php with it. Most of the examples work, about 4 don't work at all. This is geared to someone that already knows a lot about unix / linux."
4,Good Book,Easy to read. Good place to start but it would help if I had had a little programming knowledge first. I also bought Wrox Biginning PHP and it is a little more informative but has some typo's and some of the example code doesn't work. But it is good for the most part.I am going to backup and establish myself with a beginners C programming book so I can better understand programming.
3,Lacks Substance -- Has Cool Examples,"This book was helpful to get a few cool PHP scripts running. The examples are fun since they deal mainly with database driven web pages. After I went through the examples I found this books major flaw. It's a bad reference. This book is neither deep nor wide. Instead, it's fun for a few hours / days.If you are only interested in a quick introduction to PHP with some cool examples, then you should consider this book. But if you plan to do serious work with PHP you will need a good PHP reference book as this title will leave you hungry for more."
2,"If you know what an associative array is, pass on this book",If you have no coding experience this book would be a reasonable start. There is no discussion of functions or PHP libraries. I would guess that 25% of the book lists a previously stated example more than once.
3,good,"tom selleck is one of my favorite actors,,,and since i could not find this movie to rent,,,i bought it. not my favorite,,,but good just because he is on the screen."
4,Say Cheese!,I bought this for my son. He likes it. It is an interesting gift and we are glad there are enough ingredients to try several things.
5,This is my third kit to introduce cheese making to my family,"This is a great cheese making kit making cheese making fun, simple and approachable. Now I have branched into more advanced creations but I got my start here."
4,Really fun.,"Packaging is cute. Great gift idea, I bought it for my nephew who loves to cook. I cannot fully review as he hasn't used it yet. I've read that most kits come with hard to understand instructions. i'll suggest to him to read directionsl for cheese-making online."
5,I love Cheese!!,We have had a great time with this kit. It took a little bit of trying but we love the cheese it makes!!
4,Cheese kit,"Bought for my son as a gift and he used it within a few days. He enjoyed it, but needs to tweek how he made it since the cheese didn't come out as firm as he thought it would."
4,Simple way to make cheese,I looked at my local natural and standard grocery stores for the ingredients to make simple cheese. Coulnd't find it. This kit has everything at the lowest cost.I have made two batches as the provided recipe states. It came out excellent both times.
4,Great Kit for beginners,"Just finished making my very first batch of mozzarella and it couldn't have been easier. I made a 2 gallon batch and the curds took much longer to set than indicated by the instructions so I wish they had provided more helpful hints in the booklet, but the cheese still came out looking and tasting great. I recommend this kit to anyone trying cheese making for the first time that has good cooking skills."
4,Tremendous fun,This kit is easy and fun to use. I really enjoy making Mozzarella with my friends and family and trying different infusions. It is great as a gift too. There are so many options for making different mozzarella and ricotta it is surprising and fun. Great for the foodie and/or crafty person.
5,Perfectly Explained,"I'm incursioning in the art of cheesemaking and decided to give this kit a try, the booklet is extremely explicit and easy to follow, as a Chef, I recommend this kit to anyone, as it is very easy to start making some cheeses. This kit contains all ingredients (but the milk) to prepare many batches of delicious cheese, and let me tell you that you can't get fresher cheese, it will change your perception entirely of fresh cheeses when you try your recently made cheese."
5,Fantastic!,"I just finished eating a pizza made from my first successful batch of this mozzarella. I had one failed batch before this successful one and the second was great, definitely better than store-bought cheese. The instructions were good but I supplemented them by watching youtube videos and an article on instructables.com. Even with that prep my first batch failed because I didn't drain enough whey off the curds before microwaving it, and I got some mushy stuff. Now that I know where I went wrong it's a pretty easy process, and other than the kit it only required a pot, a strainer, a slotted spoon, a bowl, and milk. It took a little over an hour and I got about a pound of good cheese."
3,Go to YouTube...,"I got this kit 'cause I thought it would be helpful...it is. But you really need to watch videos (come on reading is so 90's) on how to make mozzarella. First: the curd they have with their photos is UNREAL (and I mean fantastic) my curd (and your curd) will be little balls. From the videos I've watched (and a few from pro-chefs) the curds are small (and one even says the should be)...but whatever. I threw away to gallons of milk because mine didn't match the pictures. What a waste. I could made cheese. Without doubt, get the freshest milk that you can. Follow the guidelines...but it isn't ""baking""...a lot of it is feel, and sight. I haven't had the unfortunate mistake of having used ultra pasteurized milk but if you make it with regular, just relax....its gonna come out fine even if you don't need a knife to cut. Youtube videos and you'll be happy with what your results."
5,not bad,"haven't used it yet, but seems good, has everything need inside and seems good quality. I hope to making a good cheese from it."
4,"Overall a good product, except for the thermometer","I am overall happy with this cheese kit. But one thing disappointed me. A mercury-in-glass thermometer is not suitable for cheese making because a temperature scale does not show numbers between tens, i.e 10-20,20-30. And it is crucial for cheese making, as the instruction says (95, 135 degrees), to get the right temperature."
2,Hard to make Mozzarella!,"We tried four times with different milk and could not make the mozzarella! It was a disaster- the cheese came out hard as a rock! But, the ricotta was a success!"
1,Don't bother unless you can get RAW MILK,"The directions say you can use pasteurized milk, but not ultra pasteurized.Then it goes on to say that milk marked pasteurized is usually ultra pasteurized...Either wayit won't work. Then there are directions to use powdered milk and heavy cream, guess what..it doesn't work either.There are very few places you can get RAW milk and if you cannot get it, you are out of luck.Kit is basically cheap junk too,you can pick up everything you need at walmart for about $5.00 (less the raw milk).If you really want to make your own Fresh Mozz, just go to youtube and type it in.Many, many videos on how and what to do.Good Luck."
2,So so,The enclosed directions did not make great cheese. After going online and getting alternative ways to make the cheese it still didn't make very good product. It all ended up in the trash.
1,Instructions too vague,"I got up to the taffy pull stage, after carefully reading and annotating the instructions. Then realized while I was trying to stretch the cheese that I'd never made taffy and had no idea what to do. Since basically you are buying the materials and instructions, I think the instructions should be MUCH clearer. Who wants to look up help in the midst of making cheese? I wasted a gallon of nice raw milk..."
1,Terrible for the money,Smaller than a happy meal...don't recommend... buy some products outright..not in this tiny kit..if you include shipping it was $39.
2,Terrible packaging.,"I haven't used the product yet but the packaging is TERRIBLE.The thermometer is ""cheesy"", it looks like the kind of thermometer you stick under your tongue - useless!The Salt and Citric Acid are in baggies that aren't even resealable.Sorry, but I only bought it in a kit for convenience, this isn't convenient."
3,I'll wait for the DVD set.,"We've all been waiting for seasons 4-6 for years. As much as I want to see this, I'll wait for the DVDs."
4,Excellent Solution for us,"This ladder is an excellent solution for those of us that need super sturdy! I no longer worry that my husband is going to have a step stool collapse underneath him, and he doesnt have to lug in a huge ladder to do small jobs. I'd have given it 5 stars except that the price -- seems a bit pricey but otherwise excellent."
5,Fantastic Ladder,"We use this for a boarding ladder and it works Great, very sturdy and secure. would recommend this to anyone looking for a ladder of this size."
5,Great Ladder to have,Chose ladder because I am handicapped and it is hard to climb on a ladder. This makes it like steps and has a good means of support for me from the rail that comes up.
4,Little Giant is a Giant Helper,"My husband and I fell off the same stepladder within 2 weeks of one another (he broke his leg and I sprained my knee). We decided we were being given a message that we needed something more substantial than the rinky dink things they sell everywhere. We found the Little Giant and couldn't be happier. Sturdy, secure, quality construction - everything they say it is. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars? It's a little unwieldly to move around. Don't hesitate. Spend the money. This is a great product."
1,Damaged in shipping twice by UPS...VERY FRAGILE ITEM!,"I have been very disappointed with this product. It was delivered twice by UPS damaged. The factory packaging was very poor. The ladder appears to be a good idea, but it does not meet up to the standards of other Little Giant Products that I have owned. I have always highly rated Little Giant Ladders and prefer to use them over any other product. The first was crushed at the top. The second was bent at the steps reinforcement bars. Amazon.com will not ship a third and refunded my money. If this item is so fragile in shipment, I doubt that it would be durable in everyday use."
2,Cumbersome,"I own 3 other Little Giant Ladders that I'm very happy with, this is not one of them. My other ladders are US built and this one comes from China and it shows with heavy cast aluminum steps instead of light-weight extruded steps and stiff movement. Deploying and re-stowing the ladder is overly cumbersome and really not worth the hassle. Once set up the ladder is sturdy and easy to work from, but so are many others at a lower price point. I spent $29.13 in postage to send it back and thought it money well spent."
2,Wing Little Jumbo Two-Step Safety Ladder,"This Wing Little Jumbo Two-Step Safety Ladder looks great in the photograph, but when I opened the package the steps had bright red lettering on them. This may be great for home, but I had planned to use the ladder for wedding photography.My thanks to Amazon for the easy return and credit to my charge card."
5,On the wings of heros,"When you read One the Wings of Heros, you now understand why people call old people who survived WW2, the greatest generation. People were more caring, hero's were real and did not need to blog about it or put it on a twitter page. This is a great action packed heart warming novel, that keeps on wanting to turn the pages.I have read others from the author now, many should be made into movies."
5,Get carried away to the early 1940's,"Richard Peck, with a few carefully chosen words, recreates life for a boy in the early 1940's and how that life was changed with the onset of World War II. Wonderful book with real characters. This was written in homage to his father who served in World War I - the father is the real hero, not the brother who goes off to fight in World War II. Wonderful author - wonderful book."
2,"I hate to spoil the party, but...","I grew tired of this book about halfway through and put it down. The prose is perfect, the imagery vivid, but nothing kept pulling me further into the book. I feel hesitant criticizing the award-winning author, but I can't imagine a middle school boy reading this book unless he had to, because nothing much really happens."
1,Don't buy this!!!,The gun doesn't even work and I have had no resonse from the company to send it back.
2,Cheap gun cheap price,"i would only recommend this gun to a ""noob"" airsoft player or someone plays with these same level guns. the fps and accuracy is just too low for even the mid range guns. for a beginner this is a good buy as an entry pistol but dont expect it to take you far."
1,Piece of junk.,"THis guns fps is horrible, can hold baerly any BB's, and looks retarded. Mine broke withing a couple of weeks. I had my friend unload an entire clip on my back from 15 feet and it didnt hurt. Save up some cash and buy a good gun. This one is just sad...."
1,16 shots before it broke,"The seller was great, I got the gun in only a few days, but the gun itself has some problems. Well, one problem.It sucks.I took only 16 shots before it stopped firing, so now I've got a 20 dollar paper weight. No damage during shipping, or anything like that, it just sucked. If you're looking for a cheap little airsoft pistol, go grab a spring pistol."
1,this gun sucks,"alright when your standing about 10 feet away and you get this gun shot at you, you can literally dodge them. it goes about 30 fps. i shot my brother from about 5 feet away and asked if it even hit him, i said yes but he did not feel a [...] thing. Then from about 4 feet away i shot my friend on bare skin and he couldnt even feel anything either! It shoots about 15 feet tops.this gun sucks. im not trying to joke with you, if you buy this gun you will reget it."
3,Good close range side arm,"Well this gun is ok it goes about 30ft at mabey 50fps with the bb's it came with, its also accurate. I bought this gun because i thought it was full auto but its only semi auto. This gun dose jams a lot but it did come with a ram rod. The good thing is that u don't need to keep cocking it every shot. This gun uses AAA batteries and not AA. it has a 15 round clip to. This gun is good for a fairly seasoned air softer and its light weight. Overall i say its good for the price, and a good close range side arm."
3,OK,"This gun isnt the best ive bought befor but its ok. with standard .12 bbs it curves up so you need to aim down a little bit. the clip is a pain to load and runs out quickly so that one of the things that sucks about the gun. Id estimate about 165 fps for it. so if your looking for a starter gun this one is pretty good for that but, if your looking for fire power this gun just doesnt have what it takes."
1,Don't bother,"I bought two of these pistols at once. When they arrived brand new out of the package, neither of them worked. I know it is tempting to see a semi/full auto pistol at this price but it is all irrelevant when they do not work. I went with an electric P70 instead and it actually works."
4,Scholarly and fascinating,"This is U.of Texas anthropology professor Richard R. Flores's brilliant analysis of the symbolically manufactured cultural resonance of the Alamo across nearly two centuries: first, within 19th century San Antonio's transformation (with much turbulence) from a Mexican villa to an American city, and then later in folklore, film, and television. A fascinating read, especially for those curious Texans who cherish their state's rich Hispanic heritage, and are not afraid to question the quasi-sacred symbolism they were taught in school.Fav. Quote: ""Public history should open the door to curiosity about the past, not render it conclusive and known."""
2,Caution: PostModern Literary Criticism!,"Filled with PoMo jargon, gag. There are some interesting FACTUAL segments regarding the development of downtown San Antonio...although the author's politically correct contention that Anglos set out to deliberately wipe out all vestiges of Hispanic culture is patently absurd.Grab much more than a pinch of salt, and some galoshes to wade through the LitCrit verbiage, for there are a few points of interest. But check it out from the library if possible."
1,"Terrible, generic crap!","Oh god, i can't beleive how terrible this cd truly is. Every song sounds the same, the lyrics are lame and it all seems like its been done before. Oh yeah, IT HAS! If you're looking for a good pop punk option, check out Slick Shoes or Rufio, cause Not By Choice is downright terrible."
2,not great,some ok vocal hooks and guitar work but overall this album is pretty lackluster. This is 2003 and these guys are rehashing the sound blink had 8 years ago on cheshire cat.
3,"Not full SACD, but still great content","As other reviewers have noted, this is not multichannel or multiformat. What this means is that it will only play in a SACD player, and only the Left and Right channels are active in an SACD direct 6-channel connection. No subwoofer, no surrounds, etc. It can be played from an SACD player through a standard analog/digital connection and allow the receiver to add sound processing (dolby, dts, etc) for all channel playback. It won't play in a standard CD player or computer.However, the sound quality could only improve for me as my previous copy is on vinyl (yikes!). Maybe a full SACD version will come someday . . ."
3,PG not trying to rip you off,"I think Peter Gabriel tried to get his cds out on the new SACD format too fast - this one came out in early 2003 I believe. So it is not multiformat, not multichannel, and doesn't sound that much better than the remastered version IMO.A number of reviewers thought it did sound better than the remastered version - but I cannot tell much difference."
5,"Without a doubt, my favorite Peter Gabriel CD","It is an album I can hardly ever listen to a few songs and stop, it almost always MUST be listened to from beginning to end... I can't help myself! Every song is phenomenal, unique, perfect, and as another reviewer said, ""haunting"". I think I bought this album in 1990 and I've treasured it as one of my top 10 of all-time. I just wish he'd put out more on SACD. I can't get one now for less than $100, geesh... but buy this album if you don't already have it!"
3,"Decent bag, but not what is pictured.","I ordered this product and received it on Dec 6, 2012. The item I received was similar, but not the same. Here's the big differences. No outside cell pocket as pictured. No key loop on organizer as pictured. No 4 divided sections at back as pictured. No handles on removable laptop bag as pictured, just a plain sleeve with fold over flap. Zippered mesh accessory pocket at organizer section is on bottom of bag, not at top as pictured.This bag seems to be of good quality for the price, but not what I ordered. I am likely just going to accept this bag and move on. I have researched a new bag for a while. After reading many reviews for multiple bags, I am finding that this is a more and more common occurance for people buying laptop cases through Amazon. I am not sure returning this bag would do any good. As stated, it is of reasonable quality considering the price, and will likely function fine. Just be aware that the bag may be different from the one pictured."
4,Four Years Gone - It's Catchy,"Four Years Gone is a tight and energetic punk/pop quartet from Ann Arbor, MI. I've had the pleasure of playing three shows with them (twice with Circus of Soul- a could've been/should've been good cover band, and once with Tin Omen (when I was with them, a progressive/melodic metal band). Their debut album, Shrink My World, is filled with catchy choruses, cool guitar riffs, and simple yet effective drumming. The bass keeps the songs moving (courtesy of guitarist Conrad Agincourt III). The best cuts here are: College Rock, After You, and Mattress (their demo, if you can find it, features rawer riffing and better solos, but that's just my opinion). Eugene Norchester has a fine voice, with a good midrange sound that distinguishes himself from the whiny singers so common in this genre (think Blink-182 for annoying singing). I know that this reference is dreaded by many, but if you like Green Day, you can consider this a fine debut."
5,Helping Bears with their People Problem!!,"A wonderful, well written book, full of useful information on how to live with bears. I especially liked the tips spread throughout the book by noted bear biologist, Tom Beck. I also liked reading about what different communities in the U.S. and Canada do to try to minimize bear/human conflicts. I have over 350 bear publications in my personal library and I must say that this is one of my favorites. A welcome book for anyone who lives in bear country or is planning a visit to bear country."
4,A good general guide,"This book is worth the money and proviodes lots of good tips for avoiding conflicts. It does not contain much information on bear biology, but then again it doesn't present itself as a natural history guide. I would reccommend it to anyone interested in bear-human conflicts."
3,ear-rings,"the earrings are good, although it has a dull finish & hence looks old...i didn't recieve it for a good 5 weeks after i ordered it. i wouln't recommend buying from silverspeck.com, if you want something on time..."
1,defected,"one of the earing was nice, the other looked defected. rubins were milky and diamond was burried, can't see it at all. they wouldn't repalce one, instead they refunded the money."
4,Almost perfect!,"The glasses have small flaws, but the wine is still greatly enhanced. Since they are fragile, I would not recommend using the dishwasher. Excellent value."
5,Beautiful and elegant but handle with care,"I love these glasses for white wine, and they set off iced tea perfectly. The down side is that you have to hand-wash them, and they are prone to breaking. But this is a terrific price for a beautiful set of wine glasses."
3,Its hard to beat these for the price...,"But boy, do they break easily. They're really wonderful glasses. The shape is perfect for highlighting the flavor of the wine. However, within the first few months, I had inadvertently broken about half the glasses in the set. Still...at this price, you can almost afford to break them. Just forget about putting them in the dishwasher, and handle them gingerly..."
3,"Some fun ideas if you're a kid (not a kid at heart, but really a kid)","If I had children and cats, this book would be a TEN. However, I don't so I'd rate it 3 stars. The book is pretty clear that the intended audience is kids. The back cover says, ""Children/Pets"" and, ""Games and activities for kids and cats"". The pictures are large, the typeface even larger and the tone is simple, but fun.I'd agree with some of the reviewers who say the information is pretty basic, but since the book is for children, the information will seem shiny brand new to them. This book might also be appropriate for someone who just got their first kitten or cat. However, if you've had cats for years or are an ardent cat lover, I'd say give this a pass and look for something more age appropriate for you ;)."
1,School Project?,"This book is terrible. It's like it was written by and for a 10-year-old. There is nothing innovative in this book. If you've had a cat before, you will have already known all that is listed in this book. Basically, it says the same thing over and over; cats like boxes and crumpled pieces of paper. Spend your money on a different cat book!"
5,Very good.,"Great. Nothing else. Great. I have the sample chapter on my page. I looked at it and it says that Rachel kills David or something. 3 are dead/dying. You gotta get it. Now, I know I was going to say something..."
3,"The begining was good, but whens it gonna end?!","The Trilogy with David started out with a page turner. And I'm not a big Marco fan. When it comes to Rachel, she's awesome! But this book was a little dissapointing. I'm still waiting for book #23, Tobias."
2,Very Disapointing,The first two books to this trilogy were two good books(in my opinion ****).Now you would expect #22 to be the grand daddy of them all. I DONT THINK SO. Its the worst one ever because it has a HORRIBLE(and when I say Horrible I mean Horrible) plot. I recommend not to buy it unless youre collect these books.
5,A mistake has been made and his name is David...,"Hey guys you have got to get this book.It is about a boy named David,and he is a traitor to the animorphs.Oh and I loved this book because it shows what true friends really are."
3,An OK ending to an Animorphs Trilogy,"This particular book in the series features Rachel's point of view, where she morphs into a mouse. It winds up the story of the new animorph, David, but it's not as exciting as the previous books. It has has some really good moments, but overall we were disappointed. It's worth having if you're into the whole series, but not if you are looking for just one."
4,It was a great book.,"In all the books, I think that this could be the most touching book of all (weep,weep), but Rachel the Killer overplayed her part as the wimp. No offence, I love animorph books ,and I have all the series but it seemed that she overplayed her part.By the way, some reviewers can't spell."
5,READ THIS..THIS WILL TELL U ALL ABOUT THIS BOOK...,THIS IS RACHELS BEST BOOK YET! THIS IS ALSO THE ONE WERE TOBIAS FINDS OUT ABOUT HIS FATHER BEING ELFANGOR. THE HORKBAJIR CHONICHLES HAS A PICTURE OF AN ANDALITE AND A HORK BAJIR. IT IS A BLUE COVER AND WILL COME OUT IN NOVEMBR.THIS BOOK IS THE GREATEST YET!! YOU HAVE TO READ IT!PEACE
5,I LOVE the Animorphs!!!!!,"I really love these books, but I hate having to wait for new ones to come out. Don't ever stop writing these books. They're the best!!!!! I don't know what i'd do without them :):):):):):) This book was really cool, like all of them. I can't wait to read the new ones that are coming out in october. I think it would be really cool if Tobias and Rachel got together, and if Jake and Cassie had a real relationship.They have to kiss one of these days!!!"
1,Stupid,This book really needs some work. K.A. di a terrible job of explaining how the animorphs came back to life.
1,Rushed and unplanned,"This book seems it could have used another month of tweaking. K.A.A. must have been busy for most of the month because she has never rushed a book this bad. I can tell because the book itself rushes its events, from the solution of the summit meeting to the problem of David. They weren't given any thought, thus making this book worthless. So do yourself a favor and stay away from this book or borrow it if you are desprate to see the ending of the trilogy that started out great. P.S. I consider this the downfall point of the Animorph series. From this point on seeing a good animorph book is rare. This book is the one that started that bad trend of bad animorph books."
4,Animorphs #22 The Solution,"I thought the book was ok. Just ok. #21 was far better. It is sort of stupid how K.A. speeds the book up(about the ""dead"" animorphs). It would have been a lot better if she didn't sum it up so fast. I mean she explained everything on half a page. I'm glad K.A. didn't use some corny thing to make the Animorphs ""alive"" again. I'm getting sick of the Ellimist(he can't interfear anyway). Sario Rip would be dumb and the Chee don't have healing powers. I just wished she explained how the Animorphs became ""alive"" better. The upcoming books also look good.#23-The Pretendor#24-The Suspicion#25-The Extreme#26-The Attack#27-The Exposed#28-The Experiment-Hork-Bajir Chronicals-Visser Chronicals-Taxxon Chronicals-Ellimist Chronicals(maybe)For info on any of these books e-mail me at BAF116@aol.com."
3,Not the Best,"In this book David starts messing up the Animorphs and Ax. He knocks out Ax in harrier morph, ties Marco up in his closet, and the Animorphs and Ax think he killed Tobias. Rachael and Jakes cousin gets in an accident and David morphs there cousin and then kills him. David plans to mess up the Animorphs and to take the place of Jake and Rachael's cousin. Read the book to find out what happens next!"
3,"A manifesto, but an interesting one","A little book which seeks to prove one thing: that it is writers, not directors, who govern the quality of a film. The auteur theory is turned on its head by David Kipen who argues succinctly that writers do not deserve to be as undertrodden as they are.However, and I know this is a gross generalisation, in a business as money and marketing-oriented as the movie business I think that the 'little guy' is always going to find himself at the bottom of the food chain."
1,Added muddle,"A friend in my directors workshop gave me this little book to see what I thought of it. I thought he was recommending it because it was good, even helpful in our field. It isn't. It's a totally naive and not even an original take on the function of screenplays on a finished film. I doubt that Kepen has been actively involved with film-making. If he had, he'd know that the final script is a collaborative effort and that to find the ""auteur"" involved is so difficult that, often, writers sue for credit. I thought at first that Kepen was satirizing the state of the screenwriter, but he's not. He's just added muddle to the situation of what makes a movie."
1,Radically disappointing,"As a student of film, I know that film theory often tends to be written in a private language only the writer understands. The best books are written by the film-makers, who know what they're writing about from having actually worked in the industry. What drew me to this book was the ""radical"" in the title [...]. I approached it hoping to find, at least, something new. I didn't. Does Kipen have any experience in film-making? Has he ever even talked to screenwriters; some films require a dozen film writers before they're shot, to the point that the credits themselves become blurred. To say that a writer leaves his or her imprint on a film so that it is detectable after version after version is somewhat silly. Too bad the book didn't deliver anything radical or even new--and not good writing either."
2,Not really a good value....... :-(,"Kind of misleading. Great fragrance, but just not a good value. Better off buying a small bottle (3.5oz) after cost of shipping included..."
1,Wasting your money,"Finally it arrived after I had to contact the seller to find out why they shipped my pkg so late. So this over priced teeny tiny bottle shows up in the mail today, the other reviews are right about it being very musky and for an older man, but not 30s, reminds me of a stail old cologne my grandpa kept it those glass cars on his dresser. Smells awful..I was going to put it in my boyfriends stocking, but after smelling it. I think ill give it to my 60+ yr old dad. Doubt hed even wear it.. Glad it was just a sample.."
4,small,The item was not entirely what i expected for the price but it works. It didnt smell exactly like the bigger bottles of burberry london
1,They expire in Jan 2013...,"I read some reviews about the same issue, but didn't think they still haven't fixed it. I bough 6 packs for my visit to my parents and 5 of them will expire in Jan 2013...I have to return most them and fail to bring enough for my parents...This is a pretty bad mistake, because you are guaranteed to get a bad review and returned items..."
2,Good vitamin but it will expire in 3 months,I purchased this vitamin from amazon. Vitamin is good but the problem is that all vitamin that I purchased from Amazon will be expire in 3 months!!!I also bought another box from Costco too but it will be expires in next 2 year. I don't understand why you sold vitamin that is going to expire in next 3 months to customer.I really disappointed.
1,Junk Junk Junk --,I guess for $14.00 shipped you can't expect muchBut I'll use itI guess I should have read the reviewsHopefully at a distance it will be OK
1,not worth it,The description had me thinking this would be better quality than what I got at the big box store. Not so. The bracket has rust spots and the pole is flimsy. It won't last in the Spring Wind here. I will be sending this back.
1,Can't be used outdoors,"One would think that a flag kit would be designed for outdoor use, but not this one. The three-piece pole turns out to be thinly-plated steel that has rusted along its entire length in less than a week of outdoor use. The eagle at the top turns out to be a...plastic thing that when inserted in the top spins around in the wind..."
1,Buy a better kit,The aluminum pole has collapsed several times (it's in 3 pieces) and the flag attaches to one side of the pole with plastic pushins. You'll end up buying a better one in the end - save yourself a headache and buy a better one in the first place!
1,not worth it!,"we got our flag and was quite thrilled to receive it. we put it together, didn't have any trouble there except the eagle wouldn't stay in. when we attached the hardware to the house and put the flag in, the flag pole wouldn't stay in so we had to screw that into the hardware also. the poles rusted after the first rain and after the first wind storm the flag pole bent in half and broke. waste of money!"
1,Don't buy this flag kit,"I received my flag as promised with in about 7 to 10 days. I opened it and was disappointed because I saw it was not exactly as described on line, it was cheap looking and when I tried to put it together the metal rods would not slide into each other very easy (one of the rods was bent). I tried to force it and it slipped and the sharp metal edge slashed two knuckles on my right hand. Looking at the cuts on my hand I knew the metal had done some serious damage to my middle knuckle I drove myself to the emergency room where I got 7 stiches. Since I just decided to go into business for myself I quit my job and lost my medical insurance and had to pay the 300.00 bill plus the bill for the cheap flag. I never received my free pinwheel that was promised as a free item with the purchase of my flag just an email 2 weeks after I got my flag stating the pinwheels were not available after all. If you buy the flag becareful they are dangerous if defective."
1,The bracket is awful,"Our flag always appears to be flying at half mast because the bracket has ""stretched"".I know it was a cheap set, but really..."
2,"Flag has cheap, plastic feel","We bought this as a prop for some videos we're shooting. It looks OK in the videos, but in person it looks and feels like cheap plastic."
2,Parties NOT wedding.,This book would be cool if you had to plan different types of parties. There were only about 2 ideas we picked for our wedding. A lot of the ideas are kind of cheesey. They look very homemade. But there are good ideas in this for kids parties. Just my opinion! Good luck to everyone getting married!!
3,Not what I expected...,"This book is helpful for the couple that is creating many of the elements associated with their wedding -- favors, centerpieces, items for the reception (chair covers, seating cards, etc.)Each 2-page spread features a photo of the item and a list of supplies and instructions to create it.I'd suggest checking it out in the library or bookstore before buying..."
2,the perfect wedding DETAILS,The book was not as helpful as I thought it would be - mainly decorator photos and not much information
4,Helpful in Wedding Planning,This book was one of the better books I've read for providing useful ideas that I could actually do myself. I only ended up using a couple of the ideas presented in this book but it was helpful for me in my wedding planning.
2,Aspect Ratio,"Why on earth did they change the aspect ration from 16.9 to 4.3, it completely ruins this great show...shame on you."
5,awesome tight,great product very good value and i will buy again. we use them in swings.they hold up well to weather and we get alot of rain on the gulf coast along with salt air :)
3,Holy Disorders,"A book written in the 1940s which takes place in Oxford, this is a fun look at life and lifestyles then. It centers around the players as they prepare to perform a new play which is opening in Oxford rather than the West End. As a mystery, it satisfies with some witty humour throughout. I did not fall in love with any of the characters, but enjoyed the read and all the literary references, though I probably missed a lot of them."
3,"Great album marred by ""noises""","Ron Sexsmith must have been on something when recording ""Cobblestone Runway"". The songs are all excellent but the production in many instances is weird! I thought that there was something wrong with my pressing on two of my favourite tracks-""Up the Road"" and ""Former Glory"". But actually when I read the liner notes it states in the instrumentation notes for these songs that there are ""noises'. Why anyone in their right mind would have discordant electronic noises ruining two great songs is beyond me! I am not averse to adventurous arrangements on what are essentially very simple lovely folk/country, but there are limits. That said I have given the album 3 stars because it contains some rael good stuff but with better song arrangements and production this would have been a dead-set 5 star LP. The bonus album ""Grand Opera Lane"" is worth getting and is very pleasant listening with a number of strong songs."
4,to know healing,"As I have gone through this book I have learned many different truths about what the Word of GOD has to say about healing. This is a book that will make one think about their relationship with JESUS. Because this book shows JESUS as our Healer and how HE wants to be our friend. There are many times while reading this book that I had to stop and take a close look at my walk with CHRIST. Many books have been written about healing, and some are very good, but this book takes the subject of healing deeper than any other book I have had the pleasure to read. This is a book that shows the Old Testement Law, the thread of blue, in it's fullness in CHRIST JESUS. For anyone who wants a true knowledge of JESUS and healing, and what the Bible has to say about it then this is a MUST get!"
3,Interesting,"I must confess I read this more for the style of historiography, rather than the accuracy of the content. In the former it lived up to expectation, having that travelogue style to the scholarship that is almost delightfully quaint. Not that there is a problem with that early twentieth century style of history because it is far better at drawing the general reader into a real sense of 'being there' and creating a personality. And therein lies it flaw. As with many other modern historical biographies of its time it lacks the refined historical approach of the contemporary essay, which are in themselves, confessionably dry to read.So, read it but if you're a serious scholar of Sulla go elsewhere for your information."
2,Disapointment,"This book is old, outdated and very naive in its approach to the subject matter.It is about time to see a new book about Sulla the dictator, a book which shall present all the recent research material to the modern reader.Amazon should warn the customers that this book is not a new creation but a re-print of an old book.On the other hand, although being useless for the student of ancient history, it is fluent and interesting."
1,"Despite what Nrob thinks, this book is not all it is cracked up to be","While yes, it is almost universally accepted that other, former, religions ""shaped the Christian world"". That would be a grave error, to say that it continues to shape it. Almost as grave as mistaking early Christian practices with the modern day Church. The Mysteries of Mithras, was in my opinion both fascinating and frightning. I was fascinated to learn about such a ancient and complex religion but on the other hand, it was recommended to me by a friend, who I will call Nrob. He has it in his head that Mithras was THE foundation of Christian law when it was many things and some even unique that came to form the power house religion of the modern world."
2,Mithras lite,"This book offers an excellent introduction into the modern resurgence of this religion and its practices.Scholastically however, it is found wanting by not relating the body of work to the title. If one is looking for the relationship between Mithraism and Christianity evidence will not be found here. There is reference to many parallels and similarities but this is not evidence that Mithraism shaped Christianity."
3,OK for the money,This flag flies daily under my US flag. The hem started detaching within a couple months and was badly frayed within 4 months.For the money I can't really complain. But will search out a much better quality for my next one.
5,Just as fabulous as the previous volumes,"Having now progressed to volume 5, I can tell you how wonderful the Suzuki method really is.Volume 3 is where the difficulty begins to mount. The difficulty is to prepare you for Volume 4, in which new elements are introduced. Practice makes perfect, however, and playing songs instead of pratices helps build tonalization and intonation. The only it does not build, however, is good sight reading. This is not really developed until the 4th volume.Suzuki method is not designed, however, for self-taught students. In response to another reviewer, the method is designed to help an instructor instruct the student by presenting a collection os pieces that help build the aforementioned items."
3,Okay but not so great,Decent collection of music but litte variation in theme. Little to no assistance/tips for the student. Okay but not so great.
3,Frills are loose.,"I always loved the beast wars era of transformers. Reptilion, while coming from the universe line, shares the same mold as transmetal 2 Iguanus. He was also featured (albiet briefly)in the transformers universe comic, if that is incentive for you to purchase him.Now the hook; my figure's frills are loose on one side and constantly falling off. Otherwise a delightful figure."
3,I like this stry book,"I read this book somewhere else in a library, it is an amazing book...thanks author...anyway hope you all who dont read this will be amazed with the stories."
4,Can't go wrong for the price,"Unless you have a heavy professional equipment should not need to spend a penny more. I bought because it is the smallest when closed and still long enough, 5 section not 4 like most and for the price decided to risk it. Very very happy with it. Others do not have a swing 90 degree base and a slide out piece that can stay with the camera. I hava a P80 18x optical zoom which deffinitely can use the support, yet is small and ligth.Yes theres a silly spring loaded ball on the base to help avoid the base to unscrew from the camera, which came out the back but you can easily live without it or fix it with adrop of Krazy glue as I did. If you are looking for a walking stick/ bear defense/ weapon/ monopod then just get another hobby, no such exist. For occsional game/ race standing or sitting with a medium size camera and lens or super zoom digital, this is all you need."
5,monopod,the sima monopod is a welcome addition to help get great pictures and video. folds compactly and was inexpensive.
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a cheap piece of equipment. It folded down small, which was nice. The major malfunction was the pivoting head. It would hardly hold any weight beyond a consumer digital camera. I almost lost my SLR to gravity - and I was not even trying to carry that much weight - yet, the ""sturdy"" head loosed in an instant. It just flopped. Well, you get what you pay for."
1,Don't buy it,The thing is completely useless. Within 1st 2 minutes of use I nearly dropped my camera twice. The 'quick release' is too quick. It has a release button that sticks far away out. The chance of not hiting it when you operate your camera is very low. When you hit it it comes right away out. I was fortunate I had my camera on a sholder strip at the same time - lucky me. Just a waist of money.:-(
1,"Very light, portable, cheap but the manufacturer quality is bad.",The minute I took the monopod out of cover it broke. The mounting head fell apart from the leg. The glue they use is very bad. I didn't return the product because I think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. I just fixed it myself.
4,Right for the Price,"This is a great, economical monopod that we recently got to use with our Canon Rebel. I was pleased with its size, both when collapsed and fully extended. I felt that it was well worth the cost.I would have rather had a squeeze release on the leg, but that would have increased the price. My only real complaint about this monopod is that the foot for the camera doesn't detach; that made it a little awkward actually screwing the camera on..."
1,misleading,"it is not white, and the clip that came with it is cheap and broke. look else where for a monopod, i am disappointed"
1,CHEAP,"I guess I should have listened to the reviews on this one. I can describe this monopod in one word, CHEAP!Don't expect this to stay together very long. I bought two, the first one broke within a few minutes of messing with it.The second I sent back."
1,Another piece of China Garbage,"What a BAD purchase.The bolt that you screw into your flip camera is BIGGER than all the other devices.Once you start using this worthless piece of garbage, you CANNOT SWITCH to any other hand held device because your flip camera has been bored out to only work with this device.Wish I had known that before I bought it."
4,Useful and cheap,"I am mainly using this monopod for additional stability when shooting snowboarding film. It is fairly light and easy to snap up and down. The piece that connects to the camera actually snaps off nicely so you don't have to screw the camera on every time you setup for a shot, that is pretty neato. It also snaps on very securely i never worry about it falling off if i am going downhill and trying to record. Next step GoPro =P"
1,No good for gopro,"Wanted a collapsible stick for shooting with my gopro and didn't want to spend a whole lot on it. This seemed ideal since it had the tilting head on it. It should have been a clue when I was playing with the included camera phone ""mount"" and it literally shattered to pieces in my hand. Little by little over the course of a week, the plastic started to break on this, during normal operation such as separating the quick release base from the unit to tighten up the mount screw, until finally the whole tilt head came off and nearly sent my camera under the wheels of a jeep. The stick itself seemed plenty strong, but the plastics and head construction leave a lot to be desired."
3,"Cheap, but Cheap","Good price, but a little unstable. If I had to do over again I would have spent a few more bucks."
2,Could not support the weight...,I have a Nikon D80 for use with this monopod. With the camera body and a 28-105 lens the monopod left unstable and I was not very comfortable using it. With the D80 and a 70-300 lens (the reason I bought this) the bottom two sections of the monopod did not have the clamping strength to stay extended. I used this for one day of shooting and gave up. Low quality for a low price. I have looked around at local retailers and I have found a couple options of better quality for lower prices.
4,Sima Monopod experience,This monopod was a lot smaller than the picture led me to believe but for it's size seems sturdy enough. Just don't put any heavy cameras on it. The quick release is very easy to mount and align with the camera. The tilt head worked just fine and didn't slip. Monopod is lighter than other similar units. For the price I paid I got more than I expected.
1,Seller deserves NO stars!,"I love Clinique lash building primer. It's the best I've found, and it's the only one I've tried that actually helps prevent my mascara from flaking and smudging. That said, DO NOT BUY it from this seller or any of the other Amazon 3rd party sellers who are asking $20-some plus shipping for this product. The full size product through Clinique online store is $14 plus $5 shipping.After I first checked Amazon for this primer and saw how much these sellers wanted, I went to Clinque site and ordered two at $14 apiece. I paid $6 shipping PLUS got a free sample of their lotion AND a free mini lipstick. A much better deal, wouldn't you say?"
1,Way over priced,"I thought this product might be a little more expensive if it were bought online, but I did not expect it to cost twice what it cost at a retail location in the Mall! I purchased this through Beauty Mart."
5,Love this stuff,I just finished my first tube of this primer and it is my favorite that I have tried so far.
4,slow but graceful,"I haven't found a better beginners workout for lovers of dance who want to learn ""step by step"". Patricia Moreno is dynamic and open hearted ... what a joyous combination!"
3,Average Workout,"I have been doing intermediate/advanced intensive types of aerobic exercise for 15+ years and switched to more dance dvd's over the past year to have more fun. I thoroughly enjoy Patrica Moreno's Kickbox Core Cross Train and appreciate her refreshing style. This workout is not what I would have hoped, yet because I think the dance is a fun one, I found it can be worked with. The 30 minute version was a little fast in some areas but in the 60 minute version I often found the slow pace to be 'over-thought'. I need to just do it and if I think too hard, as she demonstrates, it doesn't work. I marched in place or tried extra reps while she was demonstrating the slow version. What really saved things is that the chaptering allows you to easily repeat the too-brief 'let's put what we just learned together' as many times as you like while you get it down. I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you can get a bargain (or get it at the library as I did), it's worth adding to your collection."
3,DANCER'S BODY WORKOUT,THE VIDEO IS OK IT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.I EXPECTED MORE OF A HIGH IMPACT. IT'S MORE OF A VERY LOW IMPACT VIDEO. THE VIDEO IS GOOD FOR THOSE DAYS WHEN YOUR REALLY NOT UP TO SWEATING INTENSELY. OTHER THAN THAT THE VIDEO ARRIEVED VERY QUICKLY.
3,mixed bag of impressions,"This book is very uneven, unfortunately. On one side, photography is splendid, historical and geological discussion are very thorough, the spirit of adventure is live and well. However, I am TIRED to find Messner complaining about his partner on every single page. And the translation is so bad, that one can almost study German grammar from the English presented.The philosophical expositions in the book kept my feelings mixed as well. On one side (and perhaps this is due to a poor translation) it is full of heavy and sometimes overly sweet German Romanticism; one the other hand, Messner's treatment of the white void in front of him as a meditative medium is very honestly portrayed and splendidly presented."
3,Doll is only 1 inch tall,"It is impossible to tell from the description how large the doll in this kit is, but I bought it anyway. It didn't matter to my sister-in-law because it was a gag gift, but the doll is only 1 inch tall (if that). If you want a full size doll, buy the larger (more expensive) book set."
3,mostly a remake,"This book has good information and it is well presented. However, I did not get the impression that it was a personal experience from the author. In other words the author could have pulled in the information from other sources, compiled it into a book and published it. And that is my point; I could not tell the difference and I did not feel a personal revelation from the author. Nothing wrong with the information and it is a good starting book for someone new to the field. The author talks a lot about a C/D attached which contains exercises and meditations; of course not able to do this with a kindle purchase so I think it would be good if arrangements were made to receive the C/D separately."
3,where can i hear the CD with kindle?,"Good book for the most part, but an audio version of the CD should be available for kindle users or the whole point of the book is lost."
4,Identifying your power animal,"This is an easy-to-use guide to finding your own power animal and identifying other animal guides to help you on your journey. It offers a wide range of animals, not just those familiar to Native American Culture. I'd recommend it for those who are beginning their search."
4,An Introduction to a many layered Complexity,Steven Farmer has given us an intelligent summary to finding the right animal spirit guide for an individual with very little former reading or training on this subject.
5,Well done,"This small book may not cover all possible power animals, but it is very well done. I'd recommend it."
2,Some Books Don't Need to be Digitalized,"I bought this on Kindle, not realizing there was a CD that accompanied it. This is why the book has 3 stars. I do wish before something is placed on Kindle, that is not meant to be read without a CD.I almost requested my money back,but Shaman music is available on Itunes, as are guided meditations.As for the book,I enjoyed it, it seemed to have some sustenance, but, without the CD, I'm left out in the cold. The author does give one a basic understanding of power animals,and clearly describes a few. (What about dogs? I guess dogs are considered to be domesticated.)He describes several animals, but it is limiting.I did enjoy how he described to meet the animal guides, but I don't enjoy that he continually refers to the CD. Some books are not meant to be digitalized."
5,Great product - silly box,"This is a great product and my cat loves it; I've bought several of them over the years. The movement of the ""bird"" in the air must simulate a real bird, because it fascinates cats.Problem is, this time, these silly people sent me the one ""da bird"" in a HUGE box, big enough to put a grand piano keyboard in it. Why, I don't know, but now I have to deal with dragging that box out to the trash. Dumb thing to do, really. Oh well."
5,Better than a laser pointer,"My two cats LOVE this toy. I'm especially happy with it because my slightly chunky cat, who is rarely interested in a toy once it gets out of paw's reach, will jump and chase after the feathers with serious kitty gusto. I keep it in the hall closet and have had to move it to the top shelf because my smaller cat figured out how to open the bifold door once he saw where I kept it. I'm already on my second pack of feather refills! It's a great interactive toy."
2,Not Well Made,"I really hate to give something a negative review, but this product, while very cleaver, is so poorly made that it fell apart almost immediately. I was very disappointed."
1,USE CAUTION,"i bought this because my cat is strictly indoor and i knew he needed to get more exercise. i read about the toy in a cat behavior book and bought one. it seemed great at first, my cat was crazy for the toy & i was glad he liked it. i thought i was being careful with it but i was not careful enough. my cat really got the ""bird"" experience and when he would catch it he was very posessive and wanted to ""break"" the bird's neck, which he did every time howvever getting it back from him was not always easy. plus the head/neck portion is a small plastic piece. he ended up swallowing it and usually would vomit it back out. but, one time he did not. he had to have surgery and it ended up costing over $2000.00. we were lucky that it did not damage him seriously and they were able to ""easily"" remove the plastic. please use caution if you choose to purchase this."
3,Not Da Bird!,"I ordered these as gifts for family as my cat is obsessed with his Da Bird Toy. It said in the description that these are ""da Bird"" brand, but once I got them, the swivel part was different and you can't change the feather out like you can with the real one. Really bummed :/"
2,"Good start, poor quality!","On the first day of playing with my cats, they managed to break the tie between the fly and the rod. My cat then proceeded to eat the string when I wasn't present. This is a cheap quality product and I would recommend that no one buys this product without knowing that it breaks easily!"
3,"Cats love it, but not very sturdy","All the reviews below reflect my experience about the cat's extreme enthusiasm for this toy, however I've also found that the toy attachments will not hold up to my active cats. They can pull the feathers or fur (we've tried the optional attachments as well) right out of the housing it sits in, often this happens after only one play session. I've had one grab it and run off, then return to me a minute later with the wand and attachment minus all feathers, way to go little guy! :) I have no doubt that my cats are hairy little agents of destruction, but this is fast by even their standards. I've had more luck with competing products being more durable.Bottom line: if your cat is a couch potato who isn't likely to shred this, it's a great choice. If he's more active you might want to look into something a little heftier."
3,fun but flimsy,"My cats absolutely love the feathers and the way you can make them fly around, but this product is so flimsy! The feathers are attached to a string, which my cats immediately chewed through. I keep re-knotting it, they keep chewing through it. It would work so much better if it were fishing line or some kind of strong nylon. Also, the plastic handle which comes in two parts is difficult to put together, and while doing so it creates tons on teeny tiny splinters, which then get stuck in your hands. I had to cover those joints with packing tape. In all a great idea, done cheeply and poorly."
3,My cat is scared of it :(,"I saw this item on ""My Cat from Hell"" and decided to add it to my middle-aged cat's exercise repertoire. It moves through the air as advertised, but my cat hates it and won't play with it. I'll keep it in case I get another cat in the future."
2,The Toy Keeps Coming Off,"Our kitty was very interested, and enjoys the feathered toy. Unfortunately, the very first night he played with it the toy became detached from the string that holds it. Now we can still use it, but we have to keep retying a knot at the end of the string to hold the toy onto the end. The toy comes off fairly often. Our cat is not overly aggresive and was not chewing the string, just normal cat-play. This product would be better with a small chain holding the toy onto the end instead of the string."
5,Best Cat Toy Ever,"My cats get bored with toys really quick, but I've had Da Bird now for a month and they still go INSANE when they see it. If they hear me open the package they come tearing in from the other room. I have to hide it on top of the fridge because if I leave it on the counter, the 2 of them will rip it to shreds. It definitely gives cats a work out because it holds their attention for a long time, and they do all kinds of crazy acrobatics to catch the feathered lure. I run them around and even when they're panting and exhausted, they'll still try to kill it. Good fun for humans and cats!"
3,Cats destroyed it the first night,"Cats loved the toy, but unfortunately the cats completely destroyed it the first night. We left them alone with it for a few hours and they ripped the feathers out of the tip."
5,The best cat toy - EVER,"My kitten has a bunch of toys, but this has to be his favorite. I have purchased two of these things in the past few months. He will chase it on the floor and will jump in the air as it ""flies"" to catch it. After several minutes of intense play, he will need to rest just to catch his breath. We have learned to put it out of reach when we aren't playing with him because he chewed off the ends of the first one, ate a feather, and destroyed the string. I really like this toy because it allows me to play with him."
2,My waste of ten- dollers!,"I had this toy two-days and my cat snaped it in half from not letting go, she also pulled the feathers out of it from me trying to get it out of her mouth. To flimsy and expensive!"
3,Great toy until it breaks...every time we play!,"I am so disappointed with this cheap product. I bought one of these a few years ago and my cats really liked it. It broke a long time ago. I bought this new one and I cannot tell you how cheap this is. What a waste of money! The feather comes off even though it has some kind of (obviously cheap) glue on it. The stick part is in two parts and I have no idea why! The second the cat bats at it, it falls off. The top of the stick will go flying off about 5 minutes in even if a cat doesn't bat at it because it is in two pieces. I have never been so disappointed with a cat toy. I really wish I didn't buy it. I also bought replacement feathers. So, I spent a lot of money and it's just a piece of crap. I will not buy this again. I gave it 3 stars because when it isn't being a piece of crap, my cats like it."
2,Cats love it buy this toy is not durable,"Every single on of these break. I've had many of them because of this. The top of the feather toy comes off it's hook, so you can't use it any more. The clip breaks that attaches the toy to the string. The string breaks. It just goes on and on. One of my cat loves this, so I keep buying them. Dopey, I know, but most of the cat toys on sticks just don't interest my cats. A great cat toy, just don't expect it to last very long."
4,Hands down the cats favorite!,Both my cats absolutely love this! Very pleased with the purchase and the quality of the item. My only complaint is that I cannot open the clasp to change toys. I have to get my husband to change it. None of them are very easy to open.
2,maybe mine was broken,"We still use the toy and our cat loves it but there was no way to put the two poles together as it was shipped to us. so we have a toy with just 1/2 the pole needed, but it still kinda works. For 1/2 a toy it is expensive."
2,Kitten loved it...,My kitten loved this toy but the string didn't last more than a day. This was literally the only toy he would play with but he eventually ripped the string making the toy useless.
1,It Chipped my cat's tooth!!!,"I originally posted this review for the mouse version of this toy, but it applies to this toy as well.I have to say it's my fault. When i first saw the toy i realized it can be a hazard but my cats loved it too much. I decided to keep it and even bought several ones to replace it. my cats really really loved it. The problem with this toy is that the part that attaches the mouse to the wire has small parts that can get stuck in a cat's tooth while playing. I tried to be extremely careful when handling this toy but it seems that you can never be careful enough :(It chipped a relatively small part of my cat's tooth, but this warning is more than enough. I felt like i was obliged to tell everyone about this. By the way, the same thing applies to the other version of the toy (the one with feathers). I will post the same review for the other version as well.I really hope the company sees this and try to modify the toy."
4,My cat loves it but be careful!,"One of our cats goes bonkers for this toy!! Once he catches it, he starts growling and parading around the house to show the other two how clever he is. :) The other two like it, but prefer the wand with the long felt string on the end. Anyway, be careful how you play with this toy, as it is easy to unintentionally whack your cat in the face with the stick. The wand is black and the string is black so if you wave it around fairly quickly it is hard to see where the stick ends and the string begins. I have unintentionally hit our cat with the stick and felt awful!!!"
4,Cat loves this toy!,"My cat is in love with this toy. He seeks it out and drags it around until I get up and play with him. This is by far his favorite toy and it really tires him out, which is good for me too! I am in the process of buying all the available attachments so that he doesn't get bored. The length is great because I can sit on the couch and play with him. I only gave it four stars because the two-piece pole is always falling apart. The fit isn't snug enough. It would be much better if they could find a way to lock the two pieces together somehow. I will probably end up using duct tape."
5,Get ready for some hilarious antics from your cats...,"This toy is just great. We have two 4 month old kittens, a brother and sister. Our boy took to Da Bird immediately. He leaps, runs, flips, and basically goes crazy over this toy. Our favorite is when he gets it in his mouth and starts growling, warning anyone near by that the bird is HIS.Even though our boy LOVES this toy, our girl doesn't seem to care about it at all! She sits by passively watching as her brother goes crazy over it. But I guess that's how it is with cat toys - you win some, you lose some.I definitely recommend this toy, though - if your cat reacts like our little boy does, it is COMPLETELY worth the money. :)"
5,"Great item, fun for all!","Bought this toy for our new cat - she and we love it! It's a great size, perfect bounce in the rod. One of the best parts about this feather toy is that when you pull up quickly on it, the feathers twist and turn, making it terribly fun for the cat to watch!The only somewhat downside is the two-piece construction, the connection point is a little loose. Could be just the one we got, and a piece of tape, or a drop of glue and it's all set!Overall, great value for the toy, and our cat loves it!"
4,Cat loves it !!!!,"The stick is better than similar mouse toy, longer. The knotloosens at times. Cat patiently waits for me to tie a knot.The bird's feathers are holding up pretty good. Lost a couple.Will need a new bird at some point. Bottom line, the cat loveschasing it around. Also drags the whole unit around at times."
4,Fun cat toy,"This is a fun toy. You definitely have to make sure you supervise the toy and put it away when done. The string is quite long and can get wrapped around your cat. Our nine week old kitten loved it as soon as it was out-of-the-box. She turned wild when the feathers were in her mouth. It's very entertaining. I'd say it's one of the best toys out there because of the ease of use. I gave it four stars because I think the string needs to be thicker so it would be less likely to hurt the cat if it gets wrapped around its feet, etc."
4,"the best toy for a Boston terrier, but the fiberglass is a hazard.","My two year old Boston Terrier plays with this thing four times a day, and boy, is she in good shape. Every time she goes out, she gets a few rounds with this. We buy the feather toys by the 12-pack.But the pole does create fiberglass slivers, and we had to wrap it in duct tape. Not using is it not an option, according to the dog. It would be nice if the company would address that, because my poor wife has splinters."
5,Best cat toy ever!,"This is seriously one of the best cat toys I've ever gotten for my two cats. They are generally pretty playful, but I've never seen them go so crazy over a toy before this one. One cat likes to jump in the air for it for about five minutes, then lay on the floor and bat at it for five while she recovers, then she starts the process all over again. I'm pretty sure she could go for hours with it if I could last that long.The toy is easily stored since it breaks apart in two pieces, but I do have a small complaint about the two pieces breaking apart in play every few minutes. Some tape fixes this though. Out-of-sight storage is a must for this toy though--at first I was storing it on a shelf above our tv, and I caught one cat hanging from the tv trying to get to the shelf with the toy. Now it gets put away in a high, closed cabinet."
5,Wow...my cats love this toy!,"My cats have never loved a toy like they love this one! The feathers twirl on the end, so when I move it back it forth it looks like a bird flying over their head. I guess that's why they call it Da Bird. Neither of my two cats can resist this toy. They will jump extremely high to try to catch it and it keeps them active for a long period of time. I've only had it for about two months and I do need a replacement feather for it already, but both of my cats have their claws making it easy for them to rip out a feather every now and then. I would definately recommend this cat toy."
3,I can't recommend it for a kitten,"I'm sorry to say that we experienced two problems with ""Da Bird"" in our household:First, the feathers are too big for a kitten. Our siamese arrived at our house at 11 weeks old, and loved a ""bouncy mouse on a string"" toy my husband found at a supermarket, but gave Da Bird a wide berth. After a while, she would play with it, never wholly enthusiastically. I feel sure it was because the feathers were nearly as long as she is (not including her tail).Second, after two weeks, the feathers broke off and so the toy is now kaput."
5,Kitty Crack,"I have a shy persian cat, but not anymore with this toy! My cat will do flips and things I didn't think were possible. We've gone through 4 of these toys she loves them so much. As soon as she sees a new one in a bag she runs over and starts meowing. If you are starting to get a lazy cat get this toy!"
5,This is simply the most fun cat toy in the world,"Petsmart used to carry this item, but they don't anymore. And the fact that I'm willing to pay for shipping on an item like this should tell you just how loved this toy is. (And the fact that there are refills and that I keep buying them should also tell you that kitties get pretty wild with this toy!)"
2,WARNING,"Please if you are buying this toy for your cat, never let them play unsupervised with it. My one year old cat chewed up the rubber tip and ingested it. He is in emergency surgery right now having it removed. It is a great toy and he loves it but he never should of been left alone with the refill feathers. He loves to play fetch with them and run around the house with them in his mouth. I never thought he would eat them. Once again if you are buying this, do not let your cat play with it alone. I am writing this praying for my cats well being and don't want to see another cat owner go through this."
5,Cat LOVES this!,My cat loves this toy- the best $10 I could spend. He thinks it's a real bird...so funny to watch!
2,Falls Apart...,"My cat really enjoyed this toy for the first week I had it. And then the string that connects the toy to the wand kept unraveling, and no matter how many times I tied it back on it just kept coming undone. Now my cat doesn't play with it anymore because she is scared of it for a reason I do not understand, but that doesn't matter much anyhow because it would just break if she did try to play with it again. All in all, go for a different brand or different design. The idea works, just not this product."
3,Fantastic toy but not entirely safe,"Both of my cats absolutely love this toy, and one of them usually turns its nose up at any other toy that is offered. They will jump for the toy, chase it, stalk it...it keeps them entertained and they get great exercise in the process!The only problem is that the wand splinters, as other reviewers have noted. I STRONGLY recommend that you wrap the wand in electrical tape to prevent this issue. The manufacturer really should fix it. I'm sure the wand would be more expensive if it was made out of better material, but it would be well worth the extra cost.If it weren't for the splintering issue I would give this product five stars, hands down."
4,"Great for Cats, Watch Out for Splinters","I recently got my cat Boris this toy. He loves to chase and tackle the feathers and really gets a good work out when we play with it. Overall it is a great toy for cats, with one drawback however. The rod is made with fiberglass and Boris chewed on the end of the rod. When I picked it up my hand received lots of tiny fiberglass splinters which are very painful and impossible to see to get out. Once the pole was wrapped in duct tape it worked great. So a good product, but keep the pole part away from your cat, and your hand."
2,save your money,"Our cat loved it, but it broke within a week. The feather broke off the end. There was no way to repair. Save your money."
2,Meh,"It took about an hour for the metal hook with the feathers to come off. Fortunately, my cat seems to like batting at the empty string and carrying the feathers around, so the product kinda works as two separate toys. I still don't think it was worth my money. Maybe someone with a less aggressive cat would get better use of out it."
5,Great entertainment for indoor-cats,"Our cat is a tough case to entertain. He doesn't play much and loses interest quickly. Then I found out about ""Da Bird"" and thought it would worth the shot. Our cat loves it! It's fun to see him getting all excited, and not just watch but actually chase his ""prey"" again.Great entertainment for bored indoor-cats!"
5,da bird is da most!!!,"Just received this. My two cats LOVE it...even my usually sedentary cat!!! I cannot attest to how durable it will be, But, for now...they are in love!It does making a wings flapping appearance and sound."
1,They changed the string,"I have another of these with a broken string, so I got a new one to replace it. The new model has a different string and the new string binds together, clumps up, and prevents the toy from working. I am more frustrated than my cats. In fact, as I write this review, I have just decided to return the product and work on fixing the one with the broken string.I hope whomever makes the toy with the new string doesn't think it's working or that they have a loyal fan base. I'll go get a box and return it today."
4,Our cat loves it!,"Probably the best toy I've bought for my cat, and not the most expensive either! The other reviews and item description don't tell you that this item actually twirls and ""fly's"" like a real bird! It really grabbed my cat's attention.And despite some active and rough playing the feathers are not as beat up as I thought they would be, but further down the line I'm glad to know that I can just buy a feather replacement instead of having to buy the whole toy over again!I've read the other reviews and am glad I did, because I do not leave it out when I'm not actively watching my cat play with it because of the claims of fiberglass splinters injuring pets and their owners."
5,Awesome cat toy,"This is my cat's favorite toy. The feathers work better and last longer than some of the other similar toys on the market. Also, they've replaced the plastic wand that this toy used to come with. It's now a thinner, more rigid two piece wand. It does flex, but it doesn't bend/deform with use like the old plastic ones did, and it's a bit longer too."
5,Best cat toy ever,My picky cat doesn't play a lot. The only 2 things she plays with are the laser pointer and da bird. This is the second da bird that I have bought and kitty hasn't become bored with it yet * fingers crossed*
5,My cat loves the toy,"It gets my cat's attention every time. She would chase this ""bird"" forever that it's hard to even put it away.The feather part seems to hold alright (some feathers do fall off over time) after all the biting and scratching.The pole and the string also provide good length.The pin looks dangerous though. I was afraid that my cat would get hurt from it, but it seems to be okay so far.Overall good purchase."
5,NOTHING beats this toy,"I have 2 kitties and although they are very different types of personalities, they both go NUTS over this. They love this toy so much that I can't play with only one of them with it. When Da Bird is out for one, the other will come charging into the room to get in on the action. It's basically a fishing lure of feathers that really looks like a bird or flying creature when you whoosh it around (think fly fishing lures). It's pretty cool to look at and my kitties run and jump and go crazy over it. I must say that I didn't know my female kitty had it in her but now I know better!I would buy this toy over and over again (if and when it wears out) and recommend to every other kitty owner I know.It's easily the BEST cat toy I've ever purchased and I've bought A LOT of cat toys. It's PERFECTION as far as I'm concerned. BUY IT."
5,best to buy,"This is the best toy for cat. Handle with perfect length, so I can sit relax and swing my arm at the same time.My cat love to play this everyday. Best buy!"
5,Every Cat Owner Should Have One!,"My cat isn't a fan of toys, generally. He had one toy, and one toy only, that he loved before this. But with Da Bird, it goes WAY beyond love. He's obsessed with the thing! From the second I took it out of its wrapper he's been all over it. We have to hide it to get him to leave it alone, and if he SEES where we've hidden it he'll try to get to it! He never gets tired of playing with it, which means he gets great exercise (to the point of panting), and it's a lifesaver when he's not feeling well. Instead of having to follow him around the house to monitor him, I just break out the toy and he plays until he's so tired that he goes to sleep. It's the best purchase I've made for him. Just a word of advice, though - buy multiple feather refills from the start. My kitty went through his first in 1 week! And it was totally worth it!"
5,The Best Cat Toy Ever!,"My indoor kitten loves this thing. He carries it around in his mouth after he's caught it, like prey and will play with it until he's ready to drop. When I see him with his tongue out, I know it's time to put the toy away. Like the other reviewers of this product, I agree that you must keep this toy out of sight when not using it. I purchased the refills and am glad I did. This is going to be one of those toys that never gets old. It's a great product. I highly recommend it for any cat that needs some exercise."
2,da Bird can kill da Cat,"My cat loved this toy. However, he really loved the string. He ended up eating it, and I spent two days sick with worry that he would need surgery to remove the string from his intestines. Luckily, he ""expelled"" it on his own. I wouldn't advise taking the risk that your cat might enjoy the string better than the toy."
3,A bit disappointed,"I purchased this pole after my original ""Da Bird"" pole broke. I thought it would make for good storage, but I've found the product to be disappointing. The pole is easily detached during playtime, so I'm constantly picking it off the floor when my kitten attacks the feather. I'm planning on purchasing another regular pole since I'm tired of always picking it up! Save your $ and buy the original one instead."
5,Awesome swiveling very maneuverable toy!,"Have had this toy two days and already my two tuxedo cats are going crazy over it. I love how much it bends and doesn't break. They love how it swivels and it makes noise when you go moderately fast that sounds like birds flapping wings. It really is the best cat toy I have purchased. I didn't immediately wrap it in electrical tape which was a big mistake because it wasn't before long that I got a teeny tiny splinter so I immediately wrapped it in tape. So far so good! Even with the splinter, I rate this a great 5 star toy that every cat owner should purchase!"
3,High-maintenance,"The cat enjoys this toy, but it does require constant human interaction. The two parts of the stick hold together some of the time, but mostly we just use the shorter stick and don't bother with extending it. Not sure if I will bother to replace the feathers when she wears them out. She likes the toy, but I don't think she loves it."
5,A toy that works,"We have purchased every cat toy under the sun. This is by far the best I have ever seen. The way feathered end spins as it flies through the air like a spinner used for fishing. Which is funny, because you could go Cat Fishing (Cishing?) with this thing. We have four cats, and sitting on the couch, I can have all four of them jumping 3 feet into the air trying to catch it.We give the cats exercise with it for 30 mins to an hour each night, so I figure if it lasts until the end of the month, I will have gotten my moneys worth out of the initial purchase. We have had for 2 weeks now and while the initial feather is starting to look roughed up, it is still working fine so far. I am not worried about it, as you can get another feather part cheaply.To sum it up, my cats sit on the desk which stores this toy and meow at me every night until I take it out. They love it, and for the first time I can say I am satisfied with a cat toy!"
5,Surfing Bird A+,"We have two cats that are polar opposites. This is the only toy that both will agree on and and I would have to say it has to be their faviorte. I've actually trained them to expect it when I bust out singing ""Surfin' Bird"". They're eyes widen and they come meowing with excitement to the closet. Must have for cat owners."
1,Still a secret after reading cover to cover,"I bought this book expecting some explicit instructions on how to set up my race car and maybe a learn few secret tricks as the title suggests.But there are no secrets or even basic set up techniques to be found here, only incoherent ramblings about how experts will disagree with the author, but nothing tangible is ever said!"
4,Reading about racing set up should only be food for thought.,"If you cannot get anything from this book then you will need to study many more basic racing set up books to get the knowledge you need. Writers of racing set up books have to say that certain things are so or they would have no credibility. I look at all of these books a different way. If i can get one tidbit of information or an idea that I can expand on then the book is work it. Never believe everything you read about race cars. Study it, test it, and repeat. I am sorry there is not a magic setup book out there that will win races for you.This book is advance thinking and an advanced method of setting up race cars."
1,Didnt get the book so I dont know.,Here it almost a month after I ordered the book and I still dont have it. How hard can it be to send a book to someone?????Lew
2,"i know the five little ducks books is great, but amazon sent me the wrong book!!!!","i order from amazon all the time, but this is the first time they sent the completely wrong book. i figure since it was a small price, it's pointless to return and have it sent again."
5,And the saga continues...,"Love the story line, love the characters, love watching Ms. Black kick butt in leather. :) Cannot wait for the next set. HURRY UP, I AM STILL WAITING !!!!!!!!!!!! This is beyond being a Sci-Fi geek becasue I have seen this story engulf people who believe they are ""normal"" and they are not afraid to admit it, unlike OTHER SHOWS (and I will just leave it at that). Catch ya later in space..."
4,"Studied, emotionally provocative at times","A combination of short, studied, emotionally provocative and winsome pieces of woodwind, violin/viols and guitarwork. Instrumental chamber music, expertly performed.The word 'plush' comes to mind. Occasionally very touching and beautiful pieces. Rated between three and four stars.Ken Cybulska"
5,Nerf bars,"Absolutely love these, had been pricing them on the web andThis beat all of them by a hundred dollars. They only took about a half hour to put on and they really look great. They arrived 2 days earlier than what they said and they make my 2004 wrangler look like a million bucks."
3,Almost OK,"After two weeks the key pad failed.This is the third key pad I've had with this system. Other than that, it works great."
5,Genie Kep Garage Entry Pad,Great company. I went for a couple of months without a garage door opener because I could not locate one of these. The newer garage door key pads would not work since my garage door opener was so old. I was so happy to fine this one. Ordered it an it got here very fast. Great company and I will certainly order from them again.
5,Great Product,"I installed one of these on my house almost 20 years ago. After 10 years of hard use it stopped functioning. I installed another and its been in use for about 10 years. The ribbon cable that connects the keypad to the control box is what failed the first time. I think that is a good track record for the price. I just ordered one for a friend from amazon - youdoit store shipped it out immediately. Youdoit store - best price I found, extremely fast shipping - thats the way its done. Thanks."
2,Quit working,"Only worked for about a year but it did work. One day it just stopped. Tried everything I could to reprogram. Not sure if it is the key pad, ribbon linkage, or the inside the garage system board. I am looking for another product."
3,"Works great, for awhile","As others have said, the product works very well, is easy to install, & quite convenient. If the company could just make them last a little longer, it would be great. I've had three in less than two years. Good news is they're cheap, & you usually end up w/ spare parts. So far, none of the same components have failed (1ST was keypad, then circuit board, then power adapter)."
5,Genie Garage Door wired keypad and Receiver,The unit works as indicated. I purchased it as a repair to a bad keypad that I had. I now have spare parts if other items fail in the system. Overall the purchase was fine and as expected.
4,Easy installation and operation,"This product is a life saver for those who don't want to install one of those ""WIRELESS"" key pad. Wireless having to mean checking the battery once in a while which it is a hassle over time.I am rating this product one star short of five because it lacks a ""LIGHTED KEYPAD."""
1,Don't deal with this company north shore commercial door,"Do not order from north shore commercial door. They are extremely rude in dealing with customers. I was told that ""they have a 30 day warranty and they did their part. It's not their problem that it broke.""I could return it to them and wait for it to arrive to them and then wait for new stock to come in as they were currently out of stock and then be shipped a new one.....or I could just contact genie anyway and get a new one sent out.I would suggest ordering directly from manufacturer like genie, as they honor the 1 year warranty."
1,I got even less lifespan out of this,Seemed to work for about six months... as long as it wasn't raining. Wet weather doesn't seem to agree with this thing. I am looking for another solution...
1,Will not last long,"I have had two of these keypads, and both stopped working a year after purchase. Although the product is recommended for outside installations, I suspect rain damage/water penetration is the cause of both of my keypads failing. The keypad does not have any sort of cover to protect it from the elements. Bad design."
1,avoid this,I thought Genie was a good company but this unit broke almost exactly after the years warranty was up. Contacting Genie was of no use. It ended up in the trash WITH my perspective of the GENIE company.
1,Works great...for a while,"This wired keypad for garage door openers works like a charm....for a few months. Number 3 just went kaput on me, in 2 years. Seems my experience is the same as several others on here. I have had enough, I am getting another style and brand."
2,Quality Control needs help,"We added this remote door opener when we bought our house 12 years ago... since then, the keypad has failed three times. Sure, this new one works, but it's about time Genie does something to improve the utility and quality of this item. The last one failed in 18 months... and it's completely out of the weather."
4,Very convenient,My purchase was to replace the identical opener. The previous one lasted several years and was very handy to have. I was very happy to discover the opener was still available and didn't consider a different opener.
1,Not Reliable - Replacing Batteries once a year or so would be easier than replacing this!,"What's the point of getting this over a wireless system or another brand? Read on to see that most of the reviews say the same thing - quits working and goes bad quickly. So unreliable that many have to replace this thing in less than a year? Most of us are hoping to avoid the hassle of replacing batteries once a year or to just have a sure way to get into your home without keys. But with this low quality design, (ovbiously a cash cow for Genie), it looks like you will have to replace the whole thing due to failure! At least with batteries, you can put a reminder in your schedule to change them once n a while so you don't get locked out! I wll look for an alternative. There really is no excuse for the Genie company - they could make this reliable - it's a choice."
1,Two units failed within 14 months,"A unit purchased May 2005 quit working 9 months later. A replacement installed at that time quit working 14 months later. The control unit was inside the garage, protected from weather. I recommend looking elsewhere for a keyless garage door opener."
1,Quits Working after about 7 months,"I really like the convenience of using a keypad that doesn't use batteries to open my garage door, but I've had to replace this unit twice in the past year. The control box is mounted indoors and has never been wet, and I can't see that the keypad is damaged in any way."
2,Same story as the others,"Works well, but not for long. I've had to replace the unit about every three years for the past ten years."
2,Doesn't last,I have had two of these. They only lasted a couple years each. I will be looking for some other brand now.
1,Can leave you stuck out in the rain,"Worked fine for about 6 months. Used daily and one day just didn't respond. No trouble shooting site I could find on this product for the problem. I can only guess from the reviews I've been reading that this is to be considered a disposable investment. Meaning, anticipate it to work for a period of time with the knowledge you will need to replace somewhere in the near future. I am looking else where. Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Junk - do not buy this,"This is unreliable junk. After carefully installing in a sheltered location, the first one failed after 3 years, and the second one failed after 10 months. I'm giving up on Genie and buying a generic wireless keypad. This one isn't worth the money."
3,Genie Keyless Garage Entry System,I like this Genie KEP-1 Universal Keyless Garage Entry System because it allows me to enter my home without hiding a key outside; I simply enter my selected code on my keypad & the garage door opens. The system is hard-wired to my garage door opener so it is not susceptible to the vagaries of accidental or intentional interference from other wireless devices.The only drawback is the system only lasts about 3 years -- but a new one is inexpensive and I can safely change to the new one in a few minutes with the simplest hand tools.
2,Genie Universal Door Opener Control,"This product worked fine for 2 weeks and then failed. The Amazon vendor, ASPDoors, would not replace the failed unit. Fortunately, GENIE Customer Service was more helpful and agreed to replace the failed unit at no charge.I will not buy anything more from ASPDoors. I will still buy GENIE products."
1,Not very good for studying...,"This book does not explain clearly on the topic and there is no example to follow on the topic. The worst is the practice session, there should be a step-by-step solution for the practice Qs."
4,Pia Zadora Biased Opinion,"Anyone not blind, deaf, or in a coma would have to like something in this flick. Yeah I'm a Zadora fan but who can doubt the talent of Savalas too? I recommend it."
2,fair.,these books are so full of generalities and sentences going both ways at the same time that it is difficult to get much help out of them. The student comments are bad enough but then the author tries to summarize discordant thoughts into his/her summary and it doesn't work. This applies not only to the Davidson book. it is no better or worse than the others. This product may be different than the school material but it still leaves a lot to be desired.
2,Easy to break,"Nice glasses, but because they are so thin, they are extremely easy to break. I bought a set of six at Christmas, I have three left just one month later. Two have snapped while hand cleaning, I can't remember why the other one broke. Way too fragile..."
3,"Pretty glasses, nice price, but they are irregulars","I got these glasses for a Christmas present on a very good 2-for-1 deal. They are very elegant looking-- and very fragile. I am not a frequent breaker of wine glasses, but the first day one just broke in my hands while I was gently hand washing it. The glasses are definitely irregulars. If you look at them closely, the shapes vary slightly, and running my hands along the sides I noticed that some are a bit warped. I am not at all disappointed, as I feel that especially with the 2-for-1, the price was excellent. But if you think you are getting top quality stemware for this price, you will not be thrilled."
5,Excellent value,"The Spiegelaus don't confer the cachet or bragging rights of Riedel stemware, but they are excelllent glasses nonetheless. I discovered them through the sommelier at Babbo, Mario Batali's flagship restaurant. The restaurant purchases Spiegelau because they are wonderful glasses, are reasonably priced and are sturdy enough to stand up to restaurant use.I was tired of breaking the overly fussy Riedels, tired of being afraid to toss my wine glasses in the dishwasher every once in a while and tired of *trying* to taste the subtle nuances brought out by the more expensive glasses. It wasn't there. In side-by-side comparisons, the Spiegelaus offer everything the Riedels do at half the price.Bottom line? Get the Spiegelau glasses and spend the rest on an extra bottle of wine or two."
3,Hard to Wash,"They are decent glasses at a decent price, but they are extremely fragile. Both my mother and I have a set and we have discovered that we have to air dry them because towl drying breaks them. If you are the kind of person who will forget about the air dry rule don't buy them. I also have a set of Reidel glasses and have not had they same breakage issues, so the Reidel set is probably worth the extra money."
3,Thin glass + narrow opening = difficult cleaning,"I like these glasses, but the glass is thin. I found them hard to clean because of the narrow opening. I have broken one while washing it, because of the narrow opening and the thin glass. My hand just ""went right through it."" Glasses are nice BUT require care when being washed."
5,Excellent value,"After we had broken a few too many of our favorite wine glasses, it was time to replenish our collection. Spiegelau glassware is attractive, affordable, and contributes to the overall enjoyment of a good glass of wine. Even though they are supposed to be dishwasher-safe, I still hand-wash them for safekeeping and longevity."
3,"Nice, but fragile","Despite my having read the reviews about fragility, my set of 6 new Spiegelau glasses turned into 5 after just one use. I was trying to be as delicate as possible while hand-washing, but the bowls on these glasses are so thin that they snap like Wheat Thins. I'm thinking I might try the dishwasher from now on, because I just can't be any more gentle with these.The glasses are nice, but far more fragile than any crystal I've had in the past. Maybe Spiegelau's short glasses are sturdy, but if you want a tall glass, then you simply have to go with something heavier."
5,very pleased,The glasses shipped safely with none of them broke. We really enjoy the size and the overall experience.
5,Best quality and value,"These wine glasses are elegant, enhance the overall wine drinking experience and yet are much more affordable than other, more popular glasses. I highly recommend this product."
3,Rebel Trooper from Hoth(episode 5),"this figure only has 6 points of articulation,limiting it's movement. overall, it goes good with the snowtrooper figure and is well detailed. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU,FELLOW STAR WARS FANS!!!!!!!!!!!!(...)"
2,Not as firm as we hoped for,"I bought this pillow for my husband who has bad hips and knees and needed some extra support for sleeping. The chiropractor recommended this style of pillow, but this particular product wasn't that great. It is too squishy and doesn't hold its shape. It only lasted one night for my husband. I use it myself now, but it really only holds your knees apart by two inches or less. Not really worth it."
2,"Very soft, squishes almost flat","This knee pillow feels like memory foam and is very soft. If you just want to keep your knees from touching, then this is great for you. If you want to keep your knees more than 1.5 inches apart, then you'll want to get something else (this is called a ""leg spacer""... but it doesn't provide much space). I bought this and the dark blue Carex one to try them both. I ended up keeping the Carex and giving this one away."
4,Not Ideal for a pet owner...,"I found this pillow to be very comfortable and enjoyed using it. Unfortunately, my kitten and puppy liked how soft it was, as well, and they chewed it up, so I had to toss it. Not a bad product, just not good for my household due to pets."
1,Worse...Purchase...Ever,"If I could choose ""no stars"" on this review, I would. I made the mistake of buying two of these. My advice, pass on these. I've had a back problem for over 18 years and just always slept with a regular bed pillow between my legs, waking up in the middle of the night to find the thing somewhere else but not where I left it when I fell asleep. So, the ergonomic design and the idea that I can turn in-bed without losing my pillow was very appealing. I bought two because I spend part of my time at my place and part at my partner's place. The pillows compress too much to be of any use. The compression is such that it's like not even having anything there. I don't know why Amazon would carry a product like this except that they get suckers like me to purchase them. I went back to my regular pillow and the only pain that the HoMedics Ortho Therapy Leg Spacer Support Pillow with Velour Cover causes or caused, was to my wallet. Pass, pass, pass...I promise you...pass on this one."
4,Very comfortable,The pillow is very comfortable. The only downside is that the pillow adjusts inside the pillow case and it is hard to straighten out.
2,Not what I'd hoped,I ordered this knee pillow to replace my worn out one. I prefer traditional foam to the memory foam- the memory foam is too hard and in the cold weather it gets extra hard because of the cooler temps in my home.
5,Nice pillow!,"I just used my new support pillow last night and it was great! I woke up without any hip pain which hasn't happened for weeks. It's true that the pillow is stiff at first, but it shapes nicely to your body as it warms up. Love it and would recommend it to anyone suffering from hip pain!"
1,HoMedics Ortho Therapy Leg Spacer Support Pillow,There is no way I could sleep with this pillow. It is most uncomfortable for me. Spacing too wide and uncomfortable. Sleeping pillow is much more comfortable than this. I would not recommend it at all.
2,Squishes too flat,"Like many other reviewers, I'm finding that it squishes so much that by the time I wake up my knees are actually touching - basically squishes down to NOTHING between your legs.I'll return and try the Carex."
2,Did not like leg pillow size.,It is too thick. I have to cut about 1 1/2 -2 inches off it. In this case bigger IS NOT better.
4,Great purchase,I use this and it does help with my back pain. I have had back pain for years. Sometimes it can get warm but overall I would recommend.
3,Too firm!!,"I bought this item for my wife, but it was too firm and too thick for her. It might work better for a bigger person."
1,Skews the hips,"I bought this pillow because I'm pregnant and have been having back trouble. The problem is that when you're sleeping on your side and it's between your knees, your knees are aligned, but your top foot is now dangling, which pulls the hips out of alignment, and makes you even more crooked when you wake up. It's not a problem with this model specifically, but for all pillows like this. I wish I hadn't used it so that I could return it."
1,HOMEDICS ORTHO THERAPY LEG SPACER SUPPORT PILLOW,"Product not as pictured...Looks thin and easily compressed compared to other leg spacers displayed on Amazon...Product was found to be hard, thick, very contoured shaped and not easily compressed."
4,Sometimes,"sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesnt. Doesnt make my lower back hurt any less, but does keep my knees from clunking and causing kneecap pain"
2,Too big.,"Too big for me. At first I thought I'll get used but days passed and couldn't feel comfortable using it. A thin pillow works better. I am very small and light, so maybe a larger, havier person would like it as the weight would make it thinner."
4,Knee Pillow,"Works great. Softens up after it warms up. Positions the legs well. I'd recommend this. Not too big, not too small."
2,Kinda Fail,"I bought this because when I sleep on my side I usually have to place a blanket between my knees or my arm even to feel comfortable. I thought that this might remedy that but being a male I found that using this kind of makes ""other things"" feel rather uncomfortable. If you're a guy, I would advise against buying one of these."
2,Uncomfortable V-shape,"Each side of this support pillow is shaped more like a V than a U. I like to place the pillow above the knees and this one puts too much pressure on my thighs and is not comfortable. I returned this HoMedics pillow and purchased the Contour brand, which is shaped more like a U.Contour Memory Foam Leg Pillow with Cover, Ecru/CreamThe Contour support pillow is quite comfortable and provides just the right spacing to keep my knees from touching. It straightens my spine even when I curl up like a baby. I can't sleep without it now!!"
4,Comfortable but a bit large,"This is a quality crafted and easy to clean product. Unfortunately, I am a smaller sized person and the pillow just seems too large between my legs."
3,Knee pillow (for back alignment),"I find this pillow a bit too bulky for my needs, but am using it anyway. It makes a great head rest/cradle in different positions. Would have like something a big more trim. Can't really be put in a suitcase for a trip."
2,Too Thick Leg Spacer Pillow,I ordered this support pillow because of a recurring problem with sciatica. The pillow is too thick and not comfortable to use. I've gone back to using a regular pillow. Hope this help those considering this purchase.
4,I give it an A-,"Great product. The shape helps it stay put while it turn from side to side at night. It is probably .75"" to 1.25"" thicker than I would prefer, but i have been using it for the last year, to the point that my lower back is uncomfortable if I do not use it. If you're a side sleeper and suffer from lower back issues or don't like your knees knocking together, this may be perfect for you. Unfolding it half-ways and using it to prop up both your legs is pretty much useless as it's way to thin when unfolded."
3,"okay, not great","This pillow is a lot larger and harder than the knee pillow I am used to. It is well-made, but not very comfortable."
3,Too stiff for some...,"I purchased this for my wife, but after one night's use she refused to try it again. She says it is too hard and stiff and does not feel comfortable. Luckily it was inexpensive... but it now sits on a closet shelf."
1,just who is it sized for?,"Bought the Homedics several weeks ago, used it for six nights and my lower back pain was worse each morning, felt like putting a full size saddle between your legs, much too thick for any degree of comfort. I think a person would have to be well over six foot tall to be able to use this to alleviate lower back pain. Unfortunately I am five foot eight inches and it made matters worse."
5,Just right...,"I have spondylolisthesis and degenerative osteoarthritis in my spine, as well as severe OA in most all of my joints. Lately, I've had severe pain in my right hip, that prevented me from sleeping at night, even after cortisone injections. I simply could not find a pain-free position until I tried a pillow between my knees. Using a bulky throw pillow simply didn't cut it, though. I had used one of these leg support pillows years ago, and decided to buy this particular pillow after researching, and reading lots of reviews.I have had it about a week now, and it has been a blessing. It is just the right size, and stays in place all night. I fall asleep with no pain, becasuse my hip and knee are more properly aligned, relieving the stress on the joints. I could not have gotten a better product for the price, either.Anyone suffering with this type of pain would welcome having this great little pillow."
1,Unusable for its intended purpose,"I purchased this pillow for my wife who has been using a pillow to separate her knees when sleeping. This item seemed to be a good replacement...I was wrong, the foam compacted in a week of use and she is back to using her pillow. I used this item myself to verify this and found that the foam is much, much too soft and needs to be replaced with a firmer material."
1,HoMedics Ortho Therapy Leg pillow,I purchased one earlier that lasted for years. This one is very flimsy and already breaking apart in the center. Very poor quality.
1,"Too big, too heavy.",I'm a tiny woman and this leg pillow is too thick and very heavy.I actually hurt my back by using it only one night.This is for the giants.
3,velcro bad decision,My wife wanted it because her hips are hurting at night because she is pregnant. Doc says taking some of the weight off her knees would help problem. The pillow works great. She sleeps better with it. Only complaint is the Velcro for the strap is uncomfortable and abrasive. I do reccomend the pillow and just cat the strap off.
1,Useless,The pillow compresses to just an inch thick when placed between one's legs. Both I and my husband tried it. A folded blanket is more useful.
4,pillow,very nice pillow but it was just too thick for me nice price though i am sure other people would like it thanks
2,It just isn't comfortable for the way I sleep.,"I want my hug pillow back. I just can't sleep on my side without it. This helps, but it isn't as good."
4,Works good.,The pillow helps keep pressure off my knees and helps with lower back pain. The pillow is somewhat crunched by morning but pops back in shape by the time I am ready to go to bed again. Would buy again.
3,Made friends with camels.,I made friends with camels - an interesting book. But to mention the author as a modern Pasternak seems exaggerated.
3,Another sad story,"A wooden translation hopefully doesn't reflect the nature of the original material. The story itself is a creative combination of history, sci-fi and social realism. In the end this reader would have preferred more sci-fi and less realism. How often do we need to repeat the telling of our personal and social miseries before we get wise to the futility of complaint?"
3,"Good content, horrible binding","The content is good. It contains a lot of information on the species found in Alaska waters, which I knew 85% of the info already, and then a lot of stream facts type of stuff.It is more thorough in terms of breadth than some other Alaska fishing resources but generally doesn't tell you a lot about each location (usually a paragraph or two).The binding came apart and broke after looking at this book for the 4th time.I would also recommend Scott Haugen's ""Flyfisher's Guide to Alaska."" Together these books give you a lot of good information."
5,A thoroughly comprehensive tour of Alaskan fishing by the state's top fishing experts,"Now in a deluxe, updated third edition, Alaska Fishing: The Ultimate Angler's Guide is a thoroughly comprehensive tour of Alaskan fishing by the state's top fishing experts. Featuring full color photography throughout, Alaska Fishing covers all seventeen Alaska sport species (including both fresh and salt water fish), all fishing methods (fly, spin, and bait), and all six regions of the state, with in-depth details on over 300 of the most productive fishing locations. Tips on regional climate and conditions, run timing, visitor service costs, trophy and record fishes, USGS map references, fishing regulations, flies for Alaskan fish, a cross-referenced index and more make Alaska Fishing as friendly to novice fishers as it is valuable to seasoned experts. An absolute ""must-have"" for anyone intrigued by the Alaskan fishing experience."
5,"Beautiful and comprehensive, an excellent reference for fishing in Alaska","I was very pleased with this purchase. The book covers all of the major sport fish that can be expected in Alaska. Each species gets a detailed treatment including biology, tackle, fishing techniques, and some of the best places to go for each species. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the various geographic regions of the state (including contact information for guides and air taxis) making it easy to plan a fishing trip by region or by species. The book is filled with photography that beautifully illustrates the fish and places of Alaska."
2,waiting on the world to change,"Amazon needs to provide a track listing for this E.P., and I, alas, am unable to do so and will thus be considered unhelpful, though that's more their fault than mine. But of the song which gives this disc its name, I can only say: ""Yeah, we're wating around... uh huh.. we ain't doing anything... oh yeah, waiting on our butts... oh yeah..."" ..... Nice inspiring anthem, ya fool!"
4,Simple English good for kids,This story uses simple English for a classic story. It is definitely good for kids in learning English. Illustrations are beautiful. Storyline is simple and clear. Highly recommend to parents to share and read this story together with your children.
2,To each their own . . .,"This book is great if you are looking for some inspiration or finding out which programs can be used to do what. However; this book was not written (and I use the term ""written"" loosely) for someone with less than 5-6 years of design under their belt.Fortunately, I am one of those people, nonetheless, I still didn't care for this book. There wasn't enough verbal-meat to sink your teeth into and say ""Oh, that's how that was done."" The authour would rather keep you guessing."
1,Rip Off!!!!!,I was ripped off!!! I was told that this item would be a full size helmet and instead I got a mini helmet. This is a pure rip off!!! This is what is called False Advertisement!!!!!!
2,It Took a While!,"It took a month to receive my book; I was happy with it once it arrived, but the slowness was a problem."
1,Read Flynn instead,"Enough revisionism and bandwaggoning already !""The American politician, without troubling his pragmatic mind with the meaning of words, has discovered socialism, and embraced it, not as a great system of social organization, but as a wondrous machine for the purpose of buying votes.""- John T. Flynn"
3,Too long; hagiography,This is a secondary source hagiography designed to appeal to Baby Boomers who think government can steer the economy towards properity.Further collapse in the dollar will shake that belief.And the book could have used an editor to pare it to half the size.
1,Racist book,"This text is racist and utterly disgusting. Quotes like ""its unfortunate that the prevailing political ideology seeks to stress the sameness of mankind"" and ""different races have different personalities and abilities, both as to physical and mental attributes"" are pseudo-scientific codes for: there are inferior races and superior races, and this view really shows throughout the book.Plus, the author really does love pictures of black/nubian/Libyan slaves. Tickles his fancy!Lastly, this book has been recommended by Stormfront.Org, a white supremacist organization:[...]Racist. Period."
1,Scholarly racism,"This book is a lame attempt to prove what has already been disproved, that the Ancient Egyptians were white. This is proof again that Eurocentric scholars no matter how much proof is brought to the light, is willing to accept the fact that Africans and Africoid peoples had anything to contribute to civilization. They offer no data to support their claims that so called Negroes were always slaves or captives. If you want to look at history without a touch of racism, do not buy this book."
5,Iasos is Superb Genius,This is unique music. Kind of like steven halpern. It is just what you need to uplift your self from all the negativity. Iasos music is healing music. Support Iasos either through buying here or his website.
3,Chrome plating not the best.,"As with most everything else these days, quality has gone down hill. Although they look nice, the chrome plating leaves something to be desired. I put these on my boat V8, fresh water and have been out once. There appears to be some rust forming around the mounting flange where it meets the actual cover. We'll see of this worsens. If so, I'll end up replacing them and maybe shop for some I can see in person first. Also the oil fill cap is plastic and feel like it could snap off."
2,"Good idea, poor effort","You can tell someone at Interplay was really fond of the Clayfighter idea, but unfortunately they weren't very good at programming it. The actual clay combatants are pretty cool looking (including a mean snowman, an Elvis impersonator, a blob, a viking opera singer, and a pumpkin-headed spectre) but they have limited animation and hard to execute special moves. The combo system is non-existant, making Clayfighter a button-masher. Backgrounds are okay without really being notable, and the music is plain forgettable, except for a wacky singing intro (yes, it sings).There were some vague differences between the original and the tournament edition, but not enough to really recommend both as a purchase (it's hard to recommend one as it is). If you want a silly diversion for cheap, Clay Fighter might be worth checking out. The sequels are slightly better, and you might get more clay for your buck with those."
5,Where's the Entire Series?,"Just adding my 'protest' alongside the other reviewers... this was one of the funniest, smartest, most well-written series on television (even today, in reruns). There really was not a single weak link in the cast. Each character had its own set of quirks that made them so interesting. Why hasn't the entire series been released by now on DVD/VHS?"
5,Pure listening and dancing FUN!,"If you enjoy listening to great Scottish/American tunes, you'll love this album of great fiddling with fine professional accompaniment. If you enjoy scottish country dancing or contradancing, your feet are waiting for this lively treat! Your energy will surge as you listen to Elke Baker's fiery version of 'Down the Broom'! Check out the dance music details athttp://members.aol.com/bakerez1/dance.html. and, of course,HAVE FUN!"
1,Very scanty details,"I was disappointed in the lack of details in the book, esp. through the Biology and Chemistry areas as well as the over commercialization by the Authors. Cannot recommend this book."
1,Terrible Review Book- Do not waste your time on this one,"I read it, and I feel like a fool buying this almost worthless work. Main objective seems just to make money for the publisher and author, best to try books that are not so commerically motivated by these authors."
3,It's OK,I use it in addition to my other Spanish books for my elementary kids in the Spanish class but it's not that great.
1,Lasted just long enough for the warrenty to expire,"Much like the other individual who had a bad lamp - Mine stopped working just a few months after the warrenty expired. Verilux customer service was polite but no help (they only sell new lamps or bulbs, not service or parts). Unrealistic as it may be I expected them to offer some consideration for the faulty lamp, it was only a few months out of warrenty. Nope.... They suggested I find 'a shop' to fix it. The ballast was crackling like a short and there was a bit of smoke. I wouldn't trust it repaired. Seems a shame to throw it away, but that's what I'm going to do. An expensive desk light relative to the short time it worked."
1,"Disappointed in International Books - paid for new, got used","I bought this beautiful book, Christmas Treasures, on 10-23-11 to give as a Christmas gift. Fortunately, I decided to keep it myself, which is a good thing because I just now noticed that it is NOT new, as ordered, but USED. I know this because it has a handwirtten greeting on the first page that reads ""Merry Christmas, Jack, Rosanne and Krystal, Dec. 25, 2003; Much Love, Mike & Kris.""How this book could have been sold by International Books as new when it was so obviously used is beyond me. How can even a used book be sold with a personal, handwritten inscription inside? I cannot imagine, had I given this as a Christmas gift in 2011. Thank Heaven I changed my mind and kept it."
2,divination? thats not Kabbalah.,"In describing this book it says it is good for ""divination"". Well according to the Torah that is an act condemned by G-d. So why would a book that portrays itself as a journey into Kabbalh emphasize the fact that it is making Judaism out to be like Tarot reading? This book is a flasification of Kaballah and a misrepresentation of faith.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Good and bad,"I've seen many good and bad reviews but still thought it will be helpful to have one for fall clean up work. As mentioned in the 'bads,' I had to put a wire tie around the neck of the hose that attaches to the bag as it just slips out easily. Whoever designed this is just plain lazy and ignorant. I didn't test the product long enough to give a full review but with minor setback, I would still give it four star min. It's still better than emptying the bag that fills up too soon."
1,DOn't waste your time or money,This product was the worst lawn and garden tool I have ever purchased. I would rather rake my leafs than deal with this. My yard has one maple tree and two oak trees. The maple leafs are so big that one of them alone would clog the hose. The hose would not stay attached to my blower/vacuum. The bag would not stay attached to the container. Absolute failure of a product.
3,Could be better!,"It works, but the hose is smaller than my previous B&D; vac. There is a significant dropoff in suction from the shoulder bag. As with the other comments, you need a hose clamp to keep the hose in the bag, but with that it works OK.I use this with a 40 gal plastic trash can. The bag comes off frequently, but so did my old one. It would be nice if they had a better way to tighten the draw string."
1,Should have listened to the other reviewers.,"Yep, other reviewers were right. I thought, as is sometimes the case, that they just weren't doing it correctly. Tube doesn't stay in the canvas top, & if it does canvas top doesn't stay on the collapsible Toro bag. Wasted money."
2,Not a time saver for me,"I bought this because I have A LOT of leaves to pick up in my yard and I thought the extra capacity this product provides would be very helpful. However, the awkwardness of attaching the collector to a garbage can and the awkwardness of moving the garbage can along as I moved around the yard ADDED time and frustration to my job. When I discovered how much capacity the leaf bag had that came with my Toro unit, it proved FAR easier to just use that stock leaf bag and empty it when it became full."
1,"Sorry, this item fails to perform","Yes some of the failures, like the hose to canvas connection can easily be fixed with a ""zip-tie"", but shouldn't it have been right from Toro in the first place?The second time I used my attachment the plactic lock on the drawstring broke, no simple fix for this one. With nothing to hold the canvas to the trash can the thing is useless.Simply, there are too may weak points on the attchment to make it worth while.I have owned this item for two weeks and used it twice. Both time involved quite a bit of time ""fixing"" or re-attaching the canvas to trash can or hose to canvas. One of the few items I will return as it is just to much work for what it is worth. To be clear, I did attach this item to the Toro 51599 Ultra blower so there was not an issue of mixing components from different manufactures.The bag that attached to the blower/vac is much more solid (although you need to empty it often)"
3,Difficult to tide up to the trash can,"This is leaf collector is a great idea but the design needs to be modified. Because the cover is made of cotton, there is not enough vent for the pressure coming from the Toro blower/vacuum. I ended up had to ask my boys to hold down the bag to the trash can to prevent it keeps popping up. There is no way you can do this by yourself. I think it can be improved to replace a section of the cotton with some sort of mesh to increase the ventilation. Hopefully Toro to make the modification for the next version."
1,Went in the trash 10 minutes after opening it,"We have a decent sized gas powered blower (Stihl BG85) and this product constantly clogged. There is a little cross piece that I think it a safety feature to keep any large pieces from flying out that clogged. however even after removing it (which you do at your own risk) it still didn't work. I spent every 30-60 seconds stopping to unclog and in order to keep it from happening I had to suck leaves VERY slowly, which was agonizing given the amount of work we had to do.Hose is too short to work easily, but longer would just clog worse.In short, we went back to just blowing and raking after a few minutes. This was a total waste of money and I was embarrassed that I'd bought it.If you have a very small yard or are doing just flowerbeds or something then maybe it might work, but as I said, I threw mine in the trash, which I think speaks for itself."
1,Do not Buy,"This device is poorly designed, as soon as you crank up the power of the blower to a sufficient level to actually suck up debris either the hose will fly out of the canvas cover or the cover will fly off the collector. Shooting chopped leaves all over the place. My kids thought it was great! Do not buy unless you are willing to play around with it an dget frustrated. By the time you figure it out with clamps, wire ties, and duct tape you could have just used the bag that comes with the blower and been finished."
4,Good concept - poor design,"This is a good product however, unless you have a rectangle trash bin to attach the bag to it is very difficult to keep attached. Don't see how it would work with the Toro round leaf container you can buy. Also, the latch on the hose that attaches to the blower is very week and dont know how long it will last...Toro needs a better design for the latch especially since it is listed as a universal hose/bag for all electric blower/vacs"
1,Terrible,"The reviews had me expecting that I would need to reengieer the whole thing. I was able to come up with a system of attaching it to my trash can where it would not blow off. CHECK! I was able to get it attached to my old Toro gas powered blower/vac (it did not fit). CHECK. I was unable to get past the constant clogs caused my the bottle neck where it connects from blower to hose. I desperately wanted this thing to work, in the end it was just a huge time sink."
4,vacuum and mulch,I only use this for vacuuming the leaves around bushes and fencing and on my deck. I love it!!!! I even gave my son some mulch for his new yard.
1,poor application,"This product is recommended with the toro blower and bucket. The product cannot work as represented. The air flow is severely restricted by the hose and cover. as a result, the blower cannot generate enough power to deliver the leaves to the bucket. Either the hoes blows off the blower or the cover off the bucket.The product needs to be re engineered. Either the cover or the bucket needs to be porous enough to allow air flow in order for this product to allow enough air pressure to move the leaves."
1,Not worth the trouble of ordering,"This product is a clever means of fleecing consumers. It works only in the sense that leaves enter the chute, are partially ground, and enter an attached container. So it does it what it says it's supposed to do. Only it does it very very very slowly. If Toro respected it's customers it wouldn't sell this crap."
4,Best leaf solution I've found so far,"I read the reviews and expected the detachment of the cover from the trash can, but didn't experience that problem that much. I have one of the fabric, collapsable trash cans and I cinched the cover down tightly and it worked pretty well. I did, however, have a problem w/ the hose coming out of the trashcan cover, so I put a tiewrap around it and problem solved. This turned what would have been a full day's worth of work into about three hours. Worked REALLY good to get under/behind the shrubs. Overall I'm very pleased w/ the product. It could use a couple of enhancements on the cover, but it's the best leaf solution that I've found so far."
2,not pleased,I was disapointed that it clogs so easy the bag i purchased wokks better than the hose and cantianer I purchased the cantainer at alocal store it was also toro the bag also i bought the best lawn and leaf vac i have had for 3 years now I regret spending the additional money to try to make it easier to use
2,"Good idea, but no workee","This is a great idea, but....The bag part won't stay attached to the garbage can no matter how hard i tighten the cord (which probably should be thicker). And when i finally got the bag to stay attached for a little while, then the hose blew out of the middle of the canvas bag that is attached to the garbage can.So all in all i like the idea but i'm going to return it to Amazon after calling Toro to ask if they have any fixes for the two problems."
2,Toro Leaf Collector needs work,"This item arrived last fall too late to be used, however I used it today to do a spring clean up of leaves.Getting everything to stay together was a chore. Either the hose blew out of the collecting basket cloth holder or the holder blew off the collector if not tightened down very tight...and then sometimes it still came off.So far I would say it is frustrating to use, but I have not given up on it yet."
2,Didn't work on pine needles,"I live in Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona. As you might guess from the name of the town, I have a lot of pine needles to rake up every spring. I thought this device might help me with the job of bagging the needles. Alas, it did not. The needles are in a mat prior to raking that is impervious to the vacuum, so I couldn't simply vacuum them into bags. After being raked into piles the needles must be hand-fed into the vacuum, which is more work and less efficient than just bagging them. I rate the device 1 star for my application, but added a star because it's very well made and I'll probably find other uses for it.On the positive side, I purchased the Toro 29210 43-Gallon Gardening Spring Bucket along with this and it really helps me bag the needles. I put a 45-gallon plastic bag from Ace hardware in the bucket and it's easy to fill the bag. Because the bucket has air holes in the bottom and sturdy handles on top and bottom, removing the filled bags is a snap!"
4,Pretty good replacement for included bag,"I bought this to replace the shoulder bag attachment that comes with the leaf blower. The bag is useless because it cuts the suction pressure by about half and once it start filling up with leaves that pressure slowly decreases even more.The suction is definitely better with this attached to the gardening bucket and I have not yet had any problems with it blowing off. I think that is attributed to the fact the I spent the time attaching it securely to the bucket with the drawstring. It takes a little getting used to, but it's not rocket science. The suction is still worse than I'd like it to be, and I found that if I just drop the hose into my giant garbage container and drop the lid it works much better. Sure, a little bit of debris will blow out because it's not sealed, but it's the seal that causes the loss of suction, so it's a trade off. My leaf blower definitely ""sucks"" a lot better now."
2,Leaf Collection System,"although i did receive quick service , this did not fit my leaf blower, it says universal but they should say which products it don't fit..."
1,Not Air tight,The bag does not stay attached. Under pressure it will pop off and blow the particles everywhere! It is fabric so particles blow through the material.
1,total junk,"Terrible suction. Very awkward to carry, maneuver. It is easier to just rake the leaves. Do not waste your money."
3,Good Design,"Overall the design of this leaf collector is great. The problem lies in the minor parts such as the straps securing it to the leaf blower, cheap, weak. You're lucky if they last through the first use. Also the clip that is supposed to keep the cord tight securing the collector to your collection container, Toro makes a nice collection container, is also cheap causing the device to loosen and blow off. Even with the weak links the overall product works, it would just work better if Toro would address the obvious flaws."
1,Crap.,"I own a Toro Ultra, and this does not readily connect to it. And when I would get it connected to the Toro on one end, and the Toro trash can on the other, it would periodically blow apart. Literally every place where it could come apart, it does. At the vac, at the trash can, even where the hose connects to the bag. Saves time when it works, but that was not very often for me. Disappointing."
1,Nice idea but dysfunctional for some of us,Although a great idea that is needed this item would not stay attached to a trash can no matter how tight I tightened it down. The leaves blowing in at an angle was just too much for the bag part that fitted over the trash can. Blew off every time I tried to use it no matter what speed I ran the vac at.
1,Almost Worthless,"Even using a bungee cord wouldn't hold this tight on the trashcan. If it stayed on for any length of time, the hose pulled/blew out. Another bungee cord kept the hose in place...sometimes. Even if it all stayed together, the hose is too short for any reasonable use and I found myself constantly pulling over the can. I would expect this product to have an ""As Seen on TV"" logo on it, not ""TORO""!!!!!"
1,Toro Universal Leaf SCATTERER,"As others have pointed out, this is a real POS. The only way to use it effectively is to have a big pile of leaves near you/the basket used to hold leaf debris and keep your Toro (or other compatible) blower/vac and the attached hose as stationary as possible. I had debris accumulate around the edge of the cover as others have noted; key is to move it as close to the edge of the container as possible (I'm using the Toro model it's ""designed"" for). The real problem is making sure the hose stays inside the cover opening during leaf collection. It's a real pain, so much so that I ended up setting it aside and using the normal catcher that came with my Toro blower vac. The idea is great; however, the design is terrible. Echoing others, it's hard to believe Toro would put their name on it."
1,Waste of money,"Toro 51500 Universal Leaf Collector with 8-Foot HoseUnpacked the unit, connected it to my trash can. The tie doesn't make a good seal to the can.Hose is so top-heavy, it tips the can over. Hose became disconnected from bag, I needed to put another wire tie on it.Finally when vacuum seal is ok, it sucks down the bag, so that leaves cannot fall into bucket. Packed it up and sent it away. Easier and less mess picking up leaves with a tarp."
1,Same experience as everyone else,"Nothing new here--just want to add my review to the others that score this product junk. After trying several different ways to hold the sheet on the collapsible Toro barrel or keep the hose attached to the sheet, I gave up. As a fairly resourceful 65 year-old woman with a disability, I didn't have the patience to try ingenious fixes such as duct tape; I simply assumed at first that I was doing something wrong. But after reading the directions several times, couldn't find any subtle hints I might have missed the first time. I suppose that I'll try to rig a fix, but in the meantime,Toro should pull this from the market and Amazon should stop selling it."
2,Not Universal for Remington Mulching Blower Vac,"You have to use the funky adaptor with a Remington mulching blower vacuum. You have to remove the glued in foam, slide it over the tube where the bag used to be attached, hold both grip tabs out while you slide the adaptor over the foam, and then tighten the short velcro strap / loop the long strap somewhere around the blower to keep the unit from falling off.I am using a rubbermaid trash can with minor amounts of mulched leaves blowing out. I will try drilled exhaust holes another reviewer suggested. Also the handles hinder the seal so I might remove one.It was either the collector or another replacement bag. Third replacement bag had blown out the zipper nylon from its fabric at the bottom of the bag. Mulched 270 gallons so far... 300 gallons more to go. If I didn't have so many leaves I wouldn't waste my time or money. I have had to buy a replacement bag every two years from the wear and tear. If I can make this work for me it is worth it."
2,Not worth the money,"While the attachment is a neat accessory, it is not effective. It was difficult to keep the bag on the trash can without a second person. I did not purchase the expandable toro trash can to accompany the leaf collector, not sure if this would have made a difference or not. Overall, very disappointed with this item."
4,Great Leaf Blower,"I have used the leaf blower about three times and it works great. It is so much more powerful than others I have used. The vacuum function did not work as well for me, however, because I have very large sycamore leaves in my yard. The leaves are wider than the diameter of the vacuum end piece; and it wasn't able to suck them up, which is the only reason I gave it four stars rather than five. I think the vacuum would work better on smaller leaves. Also, make sure you use ear protection."
2,Leaf collector is a waste of money,"I bought this leaf collector thinking that I can suck all the leaves on the lawn directly into an garbage can. I was wrong. This device is absolutely useless and poorly designed. It uses a string to attach to a receptacle which is the biggest problem of the design. The canvass cover will not stay on the gabage can during operation, and the whole apparatus is too cumbersome to lug around. I tried drilling holes in my gabage can to allow more air to escape. But it did not help that much. Don't waste your money. I actually prefer using the carrying bag that comes with Toro leaf blower as it is much more mobile."
1,not universal,"Maybe this works with a Toro blower and the Toro spring bucket, but with my Craftsman blower and normal plastic (and/or metal) garbage can it fails totally. I spent about an hour today trying to keep all the various parts together and ended up covered in leaf dust, with almost nothing in the garbage can. I really wanted this to work because I hate to empty the leaf bag - so much dust! I could not get the bag to stay on a garbage can, except for briefly once, and then the bag came off of the hose. The attachment to the blower is only slightly better than to the can or hose."
4,Good System,"I have a flexible canister to connect the system to and as long as I cinch down the string very tightly, it will stay in place. In addition, the best way to ensure the tube stays in place is to either push it further into the hole or tape it to the fabric. Still, it works well for its intended purpose."
4,Toro Leaf Collector,"Great Time saver and the price was right.However in order to be able to use it with ease, I had to purchase a hose clamp at my local hardware store to keep the hose from pulling out from the bag. Once I did that it cut my time by two thirds. With two huge pin oaks in my yard it reduced my plastic bags from about 50 to about 20. Also I would normally bag the leaves with my lawn mower which reduces the number of bags needed however,I would have to empty that every five minutes or so, what a pain.Note:If you find the bag slipping off the garbage can, try a different style can. The bag slipped of my tall can, but it stayed put on the shorter round can."
3,Not bad - could be better.,"I bought the three Toro components; leaf vac, leaf collector, and leaf bucket.The whole affair sort of works, however, it does not do that great of a job with big Oak leaves, as I found they tended to clog the intake. You have to kind of figure out the best way to do it. Even then, the ""mulcher"" only chops up leaves somewhat. I don't know if other kinds of leaves would work better or not. At any rate, its easier than raking.Also, the canvas top of the collector and the hose to the canvas comes off too easy. I realize Toro intended the leaf collector to be able to be used with any brand vac and can, but I would have rather seen them purposely build all three components together, and put a zippered top to connect the collector to the leaf bucket."
1,Don't waste your $$,Nothing will stay together. Blows apart even with extra bindings. Useless. Don't waste your money. Can't believe Toro would put their name on a product that cannot work. Would not fit on a Toro blower w/o an adapter.
4,Excellent accessory,"This is a great accessory for the Toro blower/vac. If you are just vaccuuming small quantities of leaves, the stock bag included with the vac works fine.If you have larger quantities of leaves to pick up, this hose and bonnet accessory is the way to go. It works best with the optional collapsible Toro container because you get a good seal.My only criticism of the product is that a longer hose would be more convenient for working in areas where you can't get the container in close to the vac.That's why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5."
4,Time Saver,"Saves me a ton of time when cleaning up the yard. I use this with a 45 gallon trash bin. Haven't actually timed how long it takes to fill a bin, but it is much better than chopping the leaves into the bag that comes with the blower. I spend more time chopping leaves now than I was when I had to dump them out of the bag every 30 seconds. The cloth portion that goes over the bin is very tough, I have been using it for 3 years now on my 1/3 acre lot and there are only minor snags and pulls that don't effect its function. The cloth will slip off the top of the bin from time to time during use which can be annoying (I think it is mostly due to my bin being rectangular and smooth texture). The hose will blow out from the cloth piece too. Both are minor annoyances that are quickly fixed. All in all this has made the vacuum/chopping portion of the blower/vac much more useful and my leaf cleanup chore less time consuming."
1,I wish I knew how to return it!,This Leaf Collector did not work at all. It kept falling apart and would not stay hooked up to the Toro Blower. Even if you taped it together it picked up very few leaves. I took back the Toro Blower and wish I knew how to return the Collector.
3,Good Idea,I ordered this has I have several trees in our yard. I usually use the mower and bag the leaves which works pretty good.But my leaf vac mulches much finer. I thought this would allow me to use the vac using less time. The problem is the hose is not long enough and at times you will pull the container over or the cover will come off. The attachments/componets could be engineered to connect better than they do.Should be designed better.
1,not much help.,I have stopped using it because the bag explodes off the the collection bag. I have tried to alter the system. Just stop trying to save a step and use the blower to gather the leaves into a pile and pick them up by hand.
5,Universal leaf blower hose attachment,"Used on my Craftsman blower/vac. Worked great, attachment to my machine takes a touch of practice, might just remove the quick disconnect and connect the hose directly to my machine to stop it from reducing in size for the quick disconnect. I hooked the top cover to my 50 gallon trash can. MUCH EASIER than the small quick filling bag that came with my lawn vac. cut my yard leaf collection down from days to hours. Ran mower in circles mulching and pushing leaves in piles then vacuumed up. Only touched a rake to get leaves from under shrubs.. Highly recommended over the small bag that comes with lawn vacs!"
3,Adequate with some re-engineering,"Like others I thought this was a great idea, but their execution was a bit short. I did some re-engineering and I am using this with a Leaf Cycler. Like others, I had a problem with it staying on a round trash receptacle. If it wasn't blowing off, mulched leaves were squirting out of the sides. Fortunately, I bought Toro's receptacle and ironically enough there is no problem with the canvas popping off. Haven't had any problems with clogging and I have put it through some paces. If you aren't the ""re-engineering"" type then I would not recommend it. If you are handy and don't mind fiddling with things to make them suit your needs then it is worth it."
3,Doesn't do the job,Living in Portland OR where we have many leaves that are very wet this just doesn't work.
3,Needs work or better information,"If you try to use this with an ordinary garbage can, it will either blow off of the top of the can or, if you get it tight enough on the can it will blow the hose out of the collection shroud. It might do fine with the Toro collection container, but it's more trouble than it's worth with an ordinary garbage can.Being stubborn, I'll probably drill some fine holes in the can and try again, but so far no go."
2,needs refinement,"This product is a good idea and thought it would be easy to use, but the vacuum hose keeps coming off the barrel cover attachment, other than that found it to be faster than contnually emptying the bag. ( after attaching with a wire tie )"
2,Great promise-whimpy product,"This product promised the perfect fit to my Toro blower/vacuum for shredding and collecting leaves. I found the leaf collector very lightly constructed with light weight materials and with design flaws that really surprised me regarding a Toro product. The 8 foot hose separated from the canvas cover the first time I used it and continues to an irritant. The straps and connection materials are poorly constructed as well.The biggest surprise for me was the fact that although I had a Toro blower this attachment did not fit the blower connection. Why would Toro design a Toro product that did not fit a Toro unit? I guess they feel you should buy a new blower unit at the same time. I do not use this unit anymore, it is easier to manually bag the leaves."
2,Great Idea..Poor Construction,The design team did not think this through. The hose continuously blows loose from the bag. A snap attachment on the inside of the bag would have solved this problem. Until I find away to rectify this flaw I will use the carry along bag that came with the blower. Right now it is useless.
2,Worthless for even slightly damp leaves,"Though this product works excellently on dry leaves, it clogs immediately when even slightly damp leaves are sucked up. I ended up going back to the shoulder bag that came with the blower. Didn't really make my life easier."
2,"Nothing ""universal"" about it.","I bought this item thinking that it was a good idea and it is in theory. The biggest problem is that the ""universal"" attachment is just a velcro strap to tighten the connection but it doesn't actually work against the blowing force of the vacuum. So, I found that I had to constantly hold the harness provided and it was much more uncomfortable than holding the unit by the handle. I have a Black and Decker Blower/Vac so I think I will return this one and try the one specific to my Brand."
2,Poor design. Doesn't stay attached.,Doesn't say attached to the Torro collapsable bin I bought with it. It works for short periods of time beforing belowing off with leaves and debries flying everywhere. Good idea that is poorly executed.
1,NOT EFFICIENT AS LISTED,"This contraption is not in the least bit efficient as was listed in the description. I had to go find connectors, etc. that would make it halfway useful and even then i only used it for about 15 minutes and gave up.Would not recommend it."
2,Toro Universal Leaf Collector,Bag does not stay fastened to Toro collection bag unless you duct tape it.Needs a better design for attachment.
2,Use a dust mask.........,"Use a dust mask.........don't use it near your cars...or anything else you don't want coated with dust! The material is NOT fine enough for filtering & since it only has an 8' hose....you are right in the path of a lot of leaf dust.Also, it wasn't 'universal' for my particular leaf blower, so I had to make an adaptor. If I hadn't misplaced the paperwork I'd have sent it back.It was very effective in transfering the ground up material TO the trash can though. But due to the short hose length you pretty much need to leave your blower on the ground & bring the leaves to the suction tube."
1,Returned it-an idea that doesn't work,"Having injured my shoulder this winter, I thought this product would lighten the work load. It doesn't. The square top does not make sense for a product that is probably going to be on round receptables. It kept blowing off. I tried some of the suggesstions such as tie around the hose--that did keep the hose on, I tried plastic trash can, and cloth leaf barrells and the top would blow off. I tried putting bungee cords around the leaf collecter to keep it snug, and that did not work. My rented yard is full of mature trees, and therefore leaves. Last Fall, I was not able to keep up with them. I hate yard work, and can not afford to pay someone else to do it. This product did not help--I think it is more work than using the bag to the leaf vacuum. Black & Decker makes a similar product, and I have been tempted to try it."
1,I Loved the Previous Version,"This was a replacement for the same product from Toro that was about 4 years old. The old collector was still working with some duct tape an zip ties holding it together, but the blower had to be replaced and the connection was different. I use it to shred and collect leaves so they can be composted.The critical design change is the fabric: it doesn't let enough air through to relieve the pressure in the bin. This results in too much pressure in the bin, blowing the skirt off, and popping the hose out. It also results in lower velocity in the hose, less leaves sucked up, and a slower job when it works at all. It does contain more fine dust, but I was adept at positioning myself upwind of the dust so it didn't bother me.I'm looking to get my money back, both for the Blower Vacuum and the Leaf Collector, either from Amazon or Toro."
1,You get what you pay for!,"Add me to the list of those who call the Toro 51500 what it is - a piece of junk.What a shame the Toro folks don't read these reviews, for if they did they'd pull this ridiculous item from the marketplace.I spent more time putting the bag back on my 32-gallon container - reattaching the adaptor that I thought I would NOT need for my TORO leaf blower/vacuum and moving everything from place to place than picking up the leaves on my lawn! Add to that getting flithy from what is normally a dirty job - but when things come apart, standby for flying debris!The most recent negatives about this product are the same as what I have to say, so no point in belaboring the issue.You get what you pay for! I shudda known bettAH . . ."
1,"believe the reviews, DO NOT BUY","I decided for the very low marked down price, in spite of the negative reviews I would surely be able to make this work.. I ended up going back to the bag that came with my leaf blower and doing some by hand.First of all, I have a Toro Ultra Vac and the Toro bag, so I have Toro's ""complete setup"". I tried other trash bins and they didn't help the issue.So as others have said, you have been forewarned, if you buy it you are giving your money away for a piece of junk.The top blows off, the tube pulls out of the top.. it's just not worth the time or the trouble."
1,Toro 51500 Universal Leaf Collector with 8-Foot Hose,The hose will not stay in the top of the cloth cover. This creates many disturbances while trying to pick up leaves. The waste collects at the top of the cloth cover around the edges instead of in the container. Don't waste your time with this product.
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","I bought this to go along with the consumer reports best-rated toro leaf blower/mulcher thinking I could mulch leaves with the blower then use this attachment to put the leaves into the collapsible toro trashcan. This does not work at all. The attachment strings on the apron (from hose to can) does not hold tight. The hose flies off the can, sending debris everywhere. I read someone else's review and got some large clamps and put them on but this still doesn't work very well and does not resolve the fact the feed tube gets clogged over and over again. In principle it is a great idea. You think it should work, but it does not. I regret buying this. It is a waste of money. Don't make the same mistake I did, because if you do, you will remember this review later and be haunted."
2,Small Scale Only,"Living in the Northeast with lots of oak trees, I really put this through a test. The bag gets pretty heavy when full, and the need to constantly detach it from the blower and then tilt the bag over a trash receptacle is tiring itself. I tried disconnecting the bag and just using the hose to fill the recycle bags, but the hose is too short and the force of the blower tends to blow leaf dust out of the bag. The system as designed is good for small scale jobs, a single patio or sidewalk for example. But a big yard with lots of trees needs a bigger solution."
1,Not worth the money - even on sale,"It looked like a good idea, as I have lots of trees in a large yard. I got it on sale, thankfully. There was no way to keep the bag attachment on my trashcan - I opted not to buy the Toro bag device. Also, the weight of the hose would tip over my trash can receptacle unless I put a large brick or rock inside - not exactly what I wanted. In the end, after wasting more than an hour, I gave up. Lesson learned. Money wasted."
1,Does not work at all,"Bought this item with the Toro bucket. Draw string is supposed to keep the top of the collector attached to the bucket while the Toro blower is also attached. Fail! No matter how it is done, the cloth does not stay attached to the bucket, making the whole package useless."
3,Secure bag to hose with tie wrap,"The bag is held to the hose with elastic. The natural tugging on the hose that occurs with use, combined with the force of the air blowing into your container, will cause the hose to disconnect from the bag. Fix this with a plastic tie wrap.Choose a container with a lip or handles so you can secure the bag over these. If you only have a smooth rim, the bag will come off easily during use.Otherwise, OK product - limited choices in the market at this time for alternatives."
2,Poorly designed,"The idea of a cover for leaves blown into the basket is essential but execution of the way the cover attaches to the basket is poor: Basically, the flexible cover doesn't doesn't stay put and needs velcro supplied by yourself to secure it properly. The tightening cord provided is idiotic as any wind pressure quickly blows it out. M-M_M"
3,Toro 51500 Universal Leaf,Works very well for half the price of a Black & DeckerWhich is the same unit just using bungee cords to hold it on top of can?You won't have any problemsFor the price you can't beat it
1,"Nice idea, not functional","Very simply. I am a contractor that does a lot of technical installations. This would have been a great help, had it been accurate. Unfortunately it is not. They should have left the level vials off of it, because they are completely inaccurate. Unless you just need a low profile aluminum ruler, and don't mind paying for functionality that does not work, stay away from this product. We have gone back to our 10 year old plastic empire ruler/level, because at least it is accurate."
5,Ruler w/handle,I do a lot of woodworking & precise measuring & cutting. This ruler provides all I need to do that. It also comes in handy for cutting sheetrock & hardi board
3,Buy American,"I like the ruler, a good tool, but I was disappointed that it isn't an American made product. I would pay more."
4,What a good book!!!,"I took this book out of the public library a month ago for a bit of light reading. I had heard through some people at school that Mandy Moore was doing a movie called How to Deal, so when I saw the book I had to pick it up! I thought that the first section was better than the second section, becuase it delt more with sad teen issues rather than just divorce issues. I no sooner finished reading the novel, and then I ran out to my local ""Chapers"" book store, and bought 3 copies- one for me, and the other ones for two of my friends! It is a good book and I would recomend it to anybody who likes sweet sentimental books that deal with teen issues!!!"
4,Two for One!!,These two stories are great. I was into thses books and I was so glad to find out that these stories were being made into a movie!!!
4,How to Deal,"Although I loved the movie and the two books the movie was based on, I do think ""How to Deal"" should have been based on the movie. I though it was kinda odd that a movie was based on two different books. I gave this book four stars because I gave ""Someone Like You"" and ""That Summer"" each four stars. Honestly, if the book had been about the movie, I would have given it five stars."
2,Good Lathe Bad QA,"I have been using the Delta 46 -715 for little over 2 years and I use it about 3 to 5 days a week. I purchased this one because I needed a second lathe and was working on a budget. When the lathe is working it is a 5 star lathe: no vibrations, and runs smooth. But have broken 2 sets of pulleys P/N 909946. The pulley attached to the speed control lever is the one breaking. Delta Service said they are not seeing problems with these pulleys but I see in the reviews that this is a common problem. The QA of these pulleys have issues but Delta is not willing to look in to this problem, so Delta Service is a - 5 stars.The power switch is made very very cheaply and poor QA. On my lathe it only worked for two weeks before coming apart. I replaced it with a commercial grade switch for less than $5.00 and have had no problem since with the switch."
1,Good luck trying to order,"I wish I could give an honest review of this lathe, but I have been unable to order one. I have tried to order on two different sites and have been told that they are no longer available. Still trying to get credit to my account. Buyer beware!"
3,Lathe,I received the lathe on time but only had two legs for the stand. There were several communications with Amazon both written and verbal. I am a workworker beginner and have used the lathe on several training project and it seems to working fine.Johnnie Mosley
3,pajama pants,"These are okay pajama pants, they are a little stiff at first takes several washings to break in"
4,American Flag,"It is just as I expected. Embroidered stars and sewn stripes. The material is light weight, but is a great deal for the price. I only fly it on holidays so it fits my needs."
4,Well worth the $9.50 + free shipping,"This flag is not a heavy nylon, its more like a light nylon. The stripes are all double stitched and the stars are in fact embroided. If I get a year with minimal fading and no tears I'll be happy for the price."
1,Flag tore,"The flag looked nice however was quite wrinkled, I tried to iron out and get it smooth. It seemed to improve after it was hung on the pole. I had the flag outdoors and if you are looking at a unit for outside use do not buy this flag as the wind tore this one apart. It does not consist of a high grade material that can with stand the elements. I replaced with a similarly priced flag at Fleet Farm that has with stood the elements and is outside 24 / 7."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought a few of these flags for my husband to fly for family while overseas. They're thin and cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Trash in 6 months,"Glad I didn't write a review when I got it- because it looked nice and well made. Here it is 6 months later and it is faded and frayed with a whole in the center. It is mounted on my porch, and was hung from April to October in Houston sun, but no hurricanes or major rain, just sun...and now it's trash..."
3,OK FLAG>,"Bought thinking this of higher quality than what I recieved. Overall ok for the price, I guess? Would'nt recommend to a friend."
1,"Poor quality, did not last a summer.",This flag faded and frayed very quickly over the summer. Only had it up two months before I had to replace it.
2,poor quality - didn't hold up,"poor quality, the flag separated at the seams within 5 months of hanging outside, we had a windy weekend and now to top right corner is shredded"
3,Get What You Pay For,"When I want looking for a replacement flag for my house, I came across these. The description appeared to be for a solid product, as it has many of the traits of my last flag. Kinda figured there was a rather large markup on items like this, so the price was not bad. I was a little disappointed when they arrived. They are exactly what is described, but with the quality of a $4 flag. I ordered 4 as they were so inexpensive, and I am glad I did. The first one is about to blow away, having only been flown for a couple weeks. The grommets were the first thing to give way, and the cloth is all that is holding it at this time. Just keep in mind, you get what you pay for. The $50 flag is MUCH better than the $4 one."
1,Do Not Purchase This Flag - unless you want to be disappointed,"Those selling this flag are very deceptive. The whole flag is printed - no sewn stripes or embroidered stars as the photo shows. Then they are a joke to deal with after the sale. DO NOT BUY THIS FLAG! You have been warned. Just look at the other reviews that mention ""sewn stripes and embroidered stars"" there is none."
1,Read Reviews - Sort by date,"It looks like the quality of this flag has changed over the last few years. I wish I had read recent reviews, because this flag didn't even last 30 days before the seams at the fly edge had broken stitching along the whole length, and thread-bare places where the flag had been folded in the packaging. I contacted BC Novelties and their only response was ""return it and we will refund the order."" After reading other reviews i have no confidence that they will do this, and it doesn't make sense for me to pay a few dollars to return a $10 flag."
1,JUNK and a LIE,"I read the reviews on this flag where some people were saying that the flag was just stamped, not embroidered/sewn stars and stripes. I thought there was no way a company would advertise something that important and not have it be true. I was wrong. This flag is a stamped piece of junk. The stars are not ""embroidered"" and the stripes are not ""sewn"". They are just stamped on. you can see right through the flag it is so thin. I have bought cheap flags before (not from this seller) that were decent for the money. I'm flying one right now. This is not one of those flags. This is a blatant lie on the part of this seller as to the item being sold. I'm returning mine and will never buy anything from this seller again. They should get banned for this. If you buy this flag, don't say you weren't warned..."
2,Not as described,don't be fooled by the pictures that show embroidered stars. The description now says printed after I communicated with the seller. The shipping is higher than the price of the flag so it isn't worth returning. Overall okay for the price. Would have given 3 stars if the pictures and the description were accurate.
4,Good Flags,Good flag to buy when you need one. When needed I am going to buy more flags from this vendor.
2,Low Quality Materials,"I bought several of the these flags for my wife to have flown in US Air Force aircraft while she is deployed in Afghanistan. We want to give the flown flags away, which will come with a mission certificate, to family and friends. The flags are not straight rectangle, they lean to one side, and the blue dye bleed into the white stripes. I'm sure there is a joke in here about these colors do run, but I've far too displeased with the flags I ordered to make it."
1,"Cheap Cheap Cheap, You get what you pay for","I purchased two of these and sent to my son in Afghanistan. Very embarassing on my part. This product puts the meaning into the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" Not at all what was in the description"
1,Oh say can you see...,"that torn and tattered flag flying over my front porch? If you can't, it's because I'm about to take it down and have it properly destroyed because it makes the Star Spangled Banner flying over Fort McHenry look like it was brand new. This flag is less than eight months old and has faded, become thread bare, and the seams have unraveled. Where can one find a flag that lasts???"
4,good product. priced so low that i bought 2.,"i am satisfied with the purchase i made. i purchased 2 flags due to the low price. living on a farm in indiana, there are often high winds, so flags don't tend to last too long. it does look nice flying on the flagpole."
5,"This is a snappy, good looking flag!","I believe our last US Flag from Amazon was fully stitched like this one, but may have been cotton - it was very nice, lasted about three years. This new flag, of nylon, is very crisp, attractive on the post. Salute! God Bless our USA!"
4,good,My last flag tore in the strng wind- this one seems to hold up even in high wind.We live at 3500 ft and it gets windy.
5,American flag,"This flag is well constructed, and I fly it every Hoilday to pay respect to the U.S.A. I would recommened it to anyone that is a true patriot, and believes in the USA."
2,A sad excuse for an American Flag,"I bought this flag to fly in my college dorm room. As soon as I hung it on the wall, I noticed that (1) It is sewn crooked, and (2) the seams are on the wrong side. US regulations require that a flag hung vertically have the stars on the top left. If you were to hang this flag in such an orientation, the side that faces the viewer is similar to the inside of a shirt - the seams show and the overlaps of the stripes and Union blue are strikingly apparent. In addition to this, the flag is not a perfect rectangle; one side, when hung vertically, is noticeably shorter than the other, making the flag look crooked (as it is).This being said, it IS a $7 flag, so I guess you get what you pay for. But I'd never have guessed that, in this age of faulty and cheap production, the American Flag would have fallen to such a fate."
1,The Single Worst Product I've Ever Bought On Amazon (REALLY!),"If it weren't for the ""embroidered stars/stripes"" sticker on the bag, I would have automatically assumed I'd been sent the wrong product. But no. This is it. Where to begin?The most glaring thing to point out is that there is nothing sewn or embroidered about this piece of junk. It's completely printed on a piece of nylon thats thickness falls somewhere in between a cocktail napkin and a piece of rice paper. The grommets are junk and there are loose threads around the entire perimeter.It's crazy that someone can be thrown in jail for burning a flag yet we allow American vendors to sell these Chinese-made garbage approximations of the flag with no negative repercussions. It's really disgusting."
1,Something is wrong with these reviews,"There is NO WAY someone can write a 3,4,or 5 star review. Paper thin, not as described. I click the link from my invoice and it takes me to a $1.98 w/$6.95 shipping site. Called Amazon and was given an immediate refund. Thanks Amazon, shame on you seller. Please C/P my youtube to see this ..toy(...)"
2,NOT as described,Stars were not embroidered. Stripes were not sewn. Simply a printed flag. This is a low end flag. Make sure the price you pay reflects that.
2,Nylon? not close 100% cotton U.S. Flag,Ordered a U.S Flag it was supposed to be Nylon but it was 100% Cotton... but I needed it for a presentation no time to send it back... On the up side it did get here fast!!!!!!
5,GOOD QUALITY! GREAT VALUE,THE QUALITY OF THE FLAG WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTEDAND THE PRICE WAS THE BEST I HAD FOUND ON AMAZON.
4,Nylon American flag,My order was received quickly and accurately. No complaints at all. I like doing business through Amazon. My flag is great and I expect it to last a long time or at least as long as weather etc permits. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the nylon material although it may last longer than other materials like cotton etc. Only time will tell. It is near our front door and when the wind blows it makes a plastic cracking sound rather than a whipping sound you would expect from cotton or some other similar material. I'm getting use to it though. I'd recommend it.
2,Not a 24/7 flag!,"I purchased this 3x5 American flag in December '10 from B.C. Novelties. I received it without any problems or delay. It looked nice, had embroidered stars and sewn stripes and seemed to be of an adequate material weight. I began flying it sometime in Jan. of '11 on a 20' flag pole in front of my house in East Texas. I fly it 24/7 taking it down before storms and high winds when possible. The flag is now faded and began tearing and shredding about 2-3 weeks ago. Today, being a windy day, I took it down to find the stripes end of the flag torn and shredded for about a foot into the flag. Approximately 8 months of use is all that I received from this flag. If you are looking for a flag to fly most days of the year at your home or business, and will retain its deep color (the blue seemed to fade less than the red), this is NOT the flag for you. If you are looking for a flag to fly on holidays only and store it inside, then this flag you should be proud of for several years."
1,Poor quality,"Every spring I buy an American flag to fly on my dock, and I leave it up until the following May. Usually it has begun to fray a bit by the time I replace it.This flag didn't last at all. For the first time, I have had to buy a new flag in the middle of the summer. I emailed the seller and asked him to make good on it. He didn't reply. Therefore this warning: the flag is of poor quality and doesn't last."
1,Received Damaged,Item came damaged. Company told me to return and since then has ignored any inquiry from me as to my refund.
1,I wouldn't know....,"I wouldn't KNOW about the quality of this as the seller (SHOPEZUS) never SENT it to me, OR ever communicated with me!!! UGH!!"
1,Cheap junk!,"The word ""embroidered"" means sewing a pattern on cloth with thread. Nothing about this flag is ""embroidered"". The stars and stripes are all ink patterns. The flag is extremely lightweight and should bleach out after a few afternoons in the sun.Those little flags they give kids to wave? Better constructed.That bedazzled flag pin your grandmother wears? More tasteful.I once left a $10 bill in the pocket of a pair of jeans that went through the wash. It was ruined. That was still a better use of money than buying this flag."
3,American Flag,"The quality of the product was good. The only concern is that the background of the stars is almost black. Upon examening it carefully, it may have been the darkest blue on the planet. I won't be returning it, but if I'd been aware of the density of the blue, I probably wouldn't have ordered it."
3,Flag,"For nylon flag, this flag is ok. Have to replace quicker than I thought but for price, it's a good deal."
5,Great US Flag,"This Flag was even better than I had Hoped!!! It is made well, stands up to high winds and dries extremely fast after a storm (given its design and material). The quality is excellent and the hook eyes are strong. I bought three of these flags. One for me and two for my neighbors. We are all happy and I will buy this product again if need be."
2,You get what you pay for,"It arrived quickly which I was surprised and happy about but when I opened it up, I was disappointed. The backside had glue stains on the blue by the stars. not just small glue stains but long strips of glue stains. When I tried folding the flag up I noticed the flag is longer on the bottom than the top. They can't even make it a perfect rectangle!!I understand you get what you pay for so I expected the nylon material to be cheap but I didn't expect it to be poorly sewn together. I'd return it but there's no point in paying for the shipping. I'd rather go to Lowe's and spend $15 on a great, stronger material flag"
1,Shredded within months,We thought this flag would last forever but it shredded in the wind within months. We were sad and disappointed.
5,Good purchase- good seller!,"I purchased this item for a gift, so it is not yet totally unfurled, but it is exactly as I expected and arrived in good time. Thank you. Looks like it will be durable and it is beautifully stitched."
5,American Flag,"I am very pleased with this transaction. The flag is beautiful and exactly as described. The flag was received in the time promised. The price was excellent, compared to local pricing. Thank you."
5,Long Overdue!,"Of course I am going to give anything by Derek Webb five stars. Thoughtful lyrics, impressive guitar, and Derek's unique vocal style: this album is exactly what his fans have been waiting for. Derek's love for the Church is the motivation behind this album. Through his songs, he speaks truth, not just with love, but also boldness. And, personally, I think the Church needs to be confronted with some bold truth right now. Thanks Derek!"
5,Derek Webb's best album,"Derek Webb is one of the most outspoken and creative songwriters to emerge from CCM. Although he has released many albums since ""She Must & Shall Go Free"", Webb's debut solo album is still the best. Throughout the record Webb weaves beautiful lyrics (drawing heavily from Reformed theology) and upbeat acoustic/folk-rock music to create one of the best albums to ever be released in CCM. Standout tracks include ""Wedding Dress"" and ""The Church"", where Webb sings of the importance of Christ's body: ""You cannot care for me / With no regard for her / If you love Me you will love the Church""."
5,The Best of Webb's First Three Albums,"This is the best of the three ""normal"" albums Webb has created (not counting the little House album). It is devotional, worshipful, thoughtful, and poetically creative. It's a good buy if someone likes a folks/blues/pop fusion, with a little Bob Dylan flavor to it. I've heard this album got into some hot water for its repeated use of the word ""whore"" in one of the songs, but I can testify that it's use of that word is consistent with the Old Testament sources from which it came (such as Ezekiel and Jeremiah). In contrast, his second album (I See Things Upside Down) isn't as worshipful or musically creative; and the pacifistic political opinions expressed in his third album (Mockingbird) distract from the contents of an otherwise good album."
1,Black and Decker makes JUNK!,"This is the second hedge trimmer I have purchase that was a Black and Decker. The first one lasted about three years. Three years of light use, maybe once a month for three months out of the year. Not a lot of landscape to trim. The first broke where the plug would plug into the cord. So I gave B&D the benefit of the doubt and bought the Hedgehog off of Amazon. This one lasted two years and broke today, simply just kept humming and did nothing else. Nothing was jammed in the cutting part. That one was use a total of 10 times. So I have come to the conclusion that B&D makes junk. Not only from these two products, but from toasters, a can opener and other items I have purchased that where B&D. I will never buy another B&D product. The quality has gone way downhill. Guess the company hopes the stuff lasts a year, so they don't have to honor their warranty. Black and Decker=cheaply made and unreliable products"
2,Don't Buy It,I purchased this product to trim three medium bushes in the front of our house. This product does not cut well at all! It took me forever to get the job done because I had to continually repeat the cuts. It even had trouble with new growth! I am returning this product and will lose money in shipping and will only receive a partial refund since it's used. Definitely not worth it.
1,CHEAP PLASTIC JUNK,"I BOUGHT THIS TRIMMER AFTER MY HEAVY DUTY HEDGE HOG WORE OUT FROM SIX YEARS OF FAITHFUL SERVICE AND BECAME BOTH UNAVAILABLE AND UREPAIRABLE FOR A LACK OF REPLACEMENT PARTS.THIS TRIMMER BROKE AFTER LESS THAN ONE HOUR OF USE THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT. THE HANDLE SNAPPED OF AT THE CASE DESTROYING THE CASE. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED. I AM RETURNING IT UNDER WARRENTY, BUT EXPECT I WILL JUST BE GIVEN ANOTHER ONE, WHICH WILL BREAK AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO.In fact, the new one lasted almost three hours, after which the blades jammed and would not move. I took it back, again, and am being given a reund. I bought a Makita from Tyler Tools for $150, and cannot wait for it to arrive.THIS IS THE SECOND BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCT I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST YEAR THAT HAS DISSAPOINTED ME. I WILL NEVER BUY ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AGAIN."
3,"Good for a while,,,, then dead","I've had 2 battery B&D; tools and the batteries don't last. Got 2 corded B&D; Hedge Hog trimmers. This one worked well (Just a few bushes 3-4 times a year) for a couple years and then yesterday, wile trimming Ruby Lorapetalum, the motor seemed reluctant to start and slowed, then totally stopped.B&D;'s service facility is 2.5 hours away north of Atlanta.I just long for a tool like they used to make instead of this disposable stuff!!"
3,cuts rough,"received it promptly and undamaged. It kind of chews up the ends on woody plants, but is much better to use than what I had previously."
1,Disappointing Experience,"I am a past owner of a Black and Decker 22"" electric trimmer and decided to upgrade to a newer one that was a little longer and had a little more power. Unfortunately my first and ONLY experience with the new 24"" was extremely diasppointing and I ultimately had to finish trimming my 30 ft. honeysuckle hedge with my old trimmer. The new trimmer continually jammed! According to the package it states that it can cut braches up to 3/4 inches - this was false in my case. I had the trimmer jamming every 2 minutes on branches that were no larger then 1/2"". The main reason I believe the trimmer was jamming is due to the blade design. When I compare it to my old trimmer there are a log more little crevices for twigs and branches to get lodged in thus causing the trimmer to jam."
5,A Must Read for All Americans!!,Peter Lance has written facts relating to the terrorist attacks that rocked America in an easy to follow style. He points out difficencies in our intelligence network that must be addressed. Correcting problem areas can be a constructive process. I know because I work in that system as a Joint Terrorism Task Force member.
5,1000 Years for Revenge,"This book wsa fascinating and reads like a novel. It starts when al Quaida is just starting to try different ways to blow things up. You read about the connections, there's pictures of hte participants and you learn that there were a couple of people (Phillipino police officer and NY firefighter) that had strong suspicians about Sept 11 prior to the event. Should be a must read for everyone that thinks Gitmo should be closed."
5,Historic Importance,"1000 Years for Revenge is insightful, and in the future will be the book that everyone tries to locate as a first look at the disaster that struck America. It explains how the FBI still labors under the tightly structured and self-serving rules established by J.Edgar Hoover, and gives us insight into the determination and planning of the terrorists that attacked us. Excellent and informative reading!"
2,Tabloid Take on 9/11,"Well, the author's other book was an expose on ""Survivor"", so that should have told me what to expect. This book is a big tabloid take on the events of 911."
1,"terrible, lacks credibility","Take every false rumor, misinformation, slant and outright lie you can find from conspiracy theorists and disgruntled former employees, wrap them together with a sensationalist style and you can apparently sell some books.If you would like to read a book that bears some semblence of the truth about 9/11, try The Cell by John Miller and Michael Stone."
1,Nancy Floyd a hero?,"I cannot comment on the Fire Marshall who lost his life because I do not possess any knowledge regarding who he was, what he had done, or what he may have tried to do and I thank him for his courage and sacrifice. However, I suggest Mr. Lance conduct more research on Nancy Floyd's background and her FBI service before writing or relaying anything she says as gospel. The book reads like a thriller and I would give it four stars as a thriller. But because the author loses credibilty in his portrayal of Nancy Floyd, I give it an overall one star."
1,"Liberal slant, questionable credibility","Lance's anti Bush administration slant is obvious throughout the book, and clearly taints his supposed ""award-winning"" objective journalism.Having known a former associate of Mr. Lance's, who was directly cheated and denied payment for services rendered in support of one of Lance's previous books, I can only say that his credibility is questionable at best."
2,How could it be Bush's fault?,But I'm not defending him (Bush) at all because he was too busy reading a book about a goat to a bunch of schoolkids in his brothers state of Florida for his failed 'No Child Left Behind Act' - He (Bush) was in Texas as Governor signing the death certs for death row inmates like Karla Faye Tucker (and 168 others) and mocking her for 'pleading for her life' while most of this was going on.Clinton was in office then for 8 years doing deals like Whitewater.
1,Tabloid Journalism At It's Worst!,"With so many serious and important works on the subject available, don't waste your time on this cheesy piece of so-called journalism. It's seems as if the author decided on his conclusions before writing word one. ""The Untold Story""? No, the ""half-truth story"". Readers interested in this subject would be better served by ""Why America Slept"" by Gerald Posner, a superior book in every way!"
3,Placing the blame....,"For all of the FBI lapses, where is it discussed just WHY the FBI had these lapses? There is nothing in there about how the Clinton administration put walls up so that the departments couldn't share pertinent information, and that the information gathering services themselves were hindered. The FBI failures were just a bi-product of a colossal administration failure. Just remember, Mr. Clinton was busy golfing when Osama bin Laden was offered to us, and he DID NOTHING."
4,Good Read,Very informative and well written. The book gives insight into what was going on in the FBI prior to the first Towwer bombing.Wortht time to read.
5,One Plug to Connect,This light connects to a one plug harness. There is another one that looks similar that has multiple plugs for each light. Works fine.
5,Perfect fit,"The product arrived earlier than was expected and contained very useful instillation instructions.The item arrived well before it was expected,was a perfect fit and contained installation instructions which explaned every part of its installation."
4,A Pure Delight,"I received the book as a gift. ""Oh great! Another cute story about the cowboy culture"", I thought. But I felt I'd better read it lest I hurt the feelings of the giver.What a pleasant surprise. It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time.Ralph Reynolds can tell a wonderful tale. The only issue I'd take is with the title. It might have been more appropriately titled, ""Growing Up Human"". His stories were so human and touching that the ""cowboy"" could have been anywhere anytime. It just happened he was ""the Luna Kid"".Pure pleasure. (I would have given it five stars, but I'm reserving that score for Hemingway.)"
4,Meets my needs!,"I have a smallish yard with quite a few bushes that need pruning. I should note that none of the bushes have excessivley thick branches. It trims them all very nicely. Additionaly, It is not too heavy for me to hold for a lenghth of time.The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that Black and Decker should make it cordless like they do their weedwackers."
2,Call the fire department first,"I purchased this tool in May of 2008. I used it twice for a total of maybe one hour during that year. Last week, I tried to trim the yews out front and the thing started smoking like crazy and spitting chunks of plastic out from it's air vents. It may be an isolated incident, but know that there is a chance that yours will go up in smoke.They have agreed to replace the unit, but I have to send it to a third party on my dime. So if you should have to replace yours and you live in a rural area, be prepared to be told to take it to the nearest major city or to cough up postage fees.Better to spend more on a quality machine and call it a day."
3,Different Handle,The handle on the item received is different than pictured. The picture is of an older model. The style of the handle is fatter than depicted.
3,"Interesting, but it could have been better","Horn's research seems to be relatively complete, yet the product seemed disjoint. For me, the book didn't flow, and the mix was sometimes perplexing. Horn gathered a fair amount of anecdotal knowledge as well as scientific fact. However, I felt like she was trying too hard to convince me as to the mental state (on honey bees) of the sections of society throughout American history. Songs and mottoes may be somewhat of an indicator of what the average man thinks, but not a guarantee. Sometimes I felt Horn was grasping to make justifications that weren't quite there.I haven't been playing with bees long, so I don't know how many books along these lines are out there. Not many, I think. So I give Horn credit for her originality. Its an ambitious undertaking, but the execution is not as good as it could have been."
2,AP English Flashback,I am a fan of writers like H.W. Brands and David McCullough. I was hoping this book would be presented in a similar way (i.e. a narrow topic that is thoroughly covered yet enjoyable to read). I barely made it through the intro and first two chapters before throwing in the towel. This book is written for an academic audience who enjoys the abstract.
3,Pretty lame if you are a beekeeper...,"I've been keeping bees for 40 years and during that time have assimilated a lot of info from trade journals, academic texts, etc. I was pretty bored with the whole thing. I was not expecting a technical book but I just found it poorly edited."
5,The only pick I ever use,"These picks are my go-to picks and have been for 20 years. The shape and size is absolutely perfect for precision picking and the coating provides a surface that is very slip resistant. You won't be dropping these during a performance for the most part.I first found these picks when I was in music school and was using the standard, larger picks out there. I found that I was able to pick faster and with more economical motion with the smaller pick and was never able to go back to a larger size. I think that you will like these if you try them, but I can't promise that they are for everyone.Pick choice is a completely personal thing, so you might not like the smaller size of these picks, but I cannot see myself ever using a different pick."
3,Screwy jack,"The pop-up RJ-45 port is screwy, and something that will eventually break. What's the point of it? Since the card protrudes from the PC anyway, what is the advantage of the end of the card being about 1 centimeter slimmer when no cable is plugged in? If you don't have a cable plugged in, you probably don't have the card plugged in anyway."
2,Cannot get it to work at high speed,"Maybe it's just me, because the other reviews love it, but I bought it to upgrade my laptop from 100Mbs to Gigabit and it downloads much slower on this than on the integrated 100Mbs Ethernet. I have tried everything to get it working faster and gave up, pulled it out and now it is a paperweight. Gave it 2 instead of 1 because it does work, you can get connectivity on it, just I could not at anywhere close to claimed speeds."
5,The Meade 884 Tripod is the best for any amount of Money,I bought this tripod when I purchased my Meade EXT 90 EC telescope. I've read that the most important feture of any telescope is the mount. This has an excellent mount that holds the views rock steady. It comes with a nice carring case type bag. It is a polar type mount which means that you can center the view to the attitude you are at. This feature makes the optional Autostar work at its best. This fine tripod is a high end piece of equipment that will last the life of any telescope. I was very happy with the way it performs. If I could spend any amount of money I would pick this one. You need this tripod if you are serious about high quility equipment and for the price it's the best possible choice. Meade products are the best quility equipment used by professionals. This tripod is a must if you want the best.
5,The best of both worlds,"Bob Dylan's gospel songs and some of the world's greatest gospel artists come together in one spectacular project. 'Pressing On' and 'When He Returns' are in a class of their own--prophetic, profound and powerful."
4,Fine stuff even if you don't share Dylan's faith.,"I have problems with Dylan's version of the Christian faith, which seems to be rooted more in the Old Testament and the wrath of God than the love preached by Jesus in the New Testament. Nevertheless, his apocalyptic vision has undoubtedly given rise to what, however his fans viewed it at the time, can be seen in retrospect as some of the most inspired and passionate performances of his career.This album sets Dylan's (continuing) ""Christian period"" music back into the context of the black gospel genre that helped to shape it, and whether or not you share Dylan's faith, there are some stirring performances here. Ironically, Dylan himself contributes the album's one silly moment in the hammed-up chatter that precedes his otherwise powerful duet with Mavis Staples.Among all the Dylan tributes on the market, this one stands out for the unity of its vision."
4,Dylan Gospel tribute,"Great album, with very interesting variations of several of Bob's pieces from his ""Christian albums."""
4,"a wonderful idea and well sung, too!","Kudos to Jeff Gaskill, who spent some years hatching this tribute to Dylan's born again music after being impressed by Dylan's concert presentation of the songs. I remember one of those incendiary shows and I'm happy to know others were as blown away as I was. He convinced a terrific list of gospel singers to record the tribute and even convinced the principal to add some icing to the cake. Happily, a majority of the touring band also has a hand in this tribute. Nice to hear Regina McCrary, who was such a big contributor to Dylan's gospel records and tours. Probably Shirley Caesar and Aaron Neville get my vote for best performances after the first couple listens, but the whole project and package are worthwhile."
5,"Wry new soul food for sure, variously rendered","from Dylan's house in Malibu where he can ""see all the way to Ha/Wa/ee"" and into the soul of man and god in the fallen forlorn new world order of reification, war machines, false prophets, corruption in principalities and powers that seem so unending but are falling apart even as I write and BD keeps writing/singing on(say, Rome toppled by the Pauline principles as registered in Gospel Music serving a different higher-lyric order than that of the big studio markets). This recording is (for me at least) an essential part of the Dylan canon, too, taking it into Baptist churches and the smoke-white hills and coal mines of west virginia."
1,Very Disappointed!,"My friends told me this was a great CD (I'll deal with them later!) so I was very eager to check it out. Major disappointment! From the moment the first song started my bubble bursted big time. This is music for someone who's in the 70 - 80 year old range. It was ghastly! I love Christian worship music. This however would not be classified as worship. So, for anyone out there under the age of 70, do not waste your hard earned money on this."
2,What is this all about?,"Yes I appreciate the cover looks prettier than the ones before, but other than that this so-called collection 1 seems excally the same content with the one released on Feb 2006, the same title ""collection 1"" and the same contents ""750 mins"" and the same features for sure.Anyway the point is with all this time wasted to release the same contents with just a different cover, why can't they just spend some time to work on the remaining episodes, like for example keep trying to convience Toei to liscen the remaining arcs so that we can enjoy the entire show ?"
1,I won't buy any of the collection until I know they will be released all,"My husband waited for this anime for many years to get released on DVDs. I was buying all of the volume until # 12 when it stopped being released. I hate this kind of unfair behavior from the companies where they let you hanging just because it wasn't convenient for them. Since this happened with Saint seiya, I do not buy any series at all, until all the seasons get released. I do not trust they will continue even for the loyal customers that keep buying from them. My husband was very sad he could not get to watch the final episodes of the 1st saga, AT LEAST!!!!! Saint seiya is a excellent anime and it will continue to be a classic among good anime lovers!!"
5,The Essential Dave Brubeck CD,"The Essential Dave Brubeck CD is Great. Encompasses all his terrific music. A great collection of his works. i love it, especially his Blue Rondo Ala Turk. When in Turkey his last November I was having lunch in Istanbul and a version of this was being played in the restaurant."
4,"Great video, but not enough of Detroits Tiger Stadium.","Crosley Field, Ebbetts Field, Polo Grounds, Fenway, and on and on. Sorry Tiger Stadiam was not more involved, although this was a documemtory from 1991, and this is September 29, 1999--two days after its closing. A sad day in Detroit and Michigan."
3,Good Hard Case Crime Formula read,"It is another workmanlike example of the new Hard Case Crime series. Once again there is not real hero but there are characters that keep you interested. I have to mention my pet peeve, the jacket blurb leads you to believe there is some humor in the book. This seems to be mandatory these days. There is no humor or wit in the book it's pretty much of a downer (with a late exception). That isn't knocking the book it's knocking the book's marketers. A good popcorn read, you'll like it while your reading and forget it two days later. Great for a trip or a grey weekend with nothing to do."
2,Three Smart Saps w/only 5 films?,"Extremely happy to see Columbia support the Three Stooges on DVD, with another volume of their ongoing series. Three of the five shorts on this entry are among the teams' best, ""Three Little Beers"" (1935), ""Three Arabian Nuts"" (1951) and the underrated ""Three Smart Saps"" (1942). However, I'm only awarding 2 stars due to:- Only 5 shorts on this disc? Past volumes have included 6 (one with 7), and considering the information capacity of DVD, even more Stooge classics could easily fit. I'm hoping this was a one-time-only shortchanging, and future volumes will provide more for the money.- Where's the quality control!!! The print of ""Three Little Beers"" has 20 missing seconds due to a sloppy splice! One of the funniest scenes in the short (Curly dropping a plethora of golf balls from his pockets) is GONE!I want to continue supporting Columbia's Stooge DVDs, but you will have to do better than this one guys."
1,stooge-like editing,"i cant get passed the missing golf ball scene, this is like blasphemy. if you're going to release it on dvd, then do it correctly. i was really surprised the first time i viewed the dvd that the golf ball scene was cut, and yes it is a big deal! i have all this stuff on vhs already and i am buying the dvd for the complete short with the better sound quality and picture clarity. if stooge-like editing is going to be the case why should i spend my money on stuff i already have? basically columbia is saying they dont really give a woo woo woo about the quality of the stooge releases just so long as the saw bucks keep rollin' in (see, saw?)"
1,Missing Gag,"As stated in a previous review, one of the funniest gags in one of the funniest Stooges shorts ever is missing. I noticed immediately when the shot of Curly dropping all of his ill-gotten golf balls was bypassed! I'll be watching the old tape I made years ago."
2,Missing footage a travesty!!!,"Using an old print for a DVD is ridiculous! What is going on with Columbia? Also, the fact that there are only five is terrible too. Why not have 10 shorts from the best surviving prints? Each disc could have 5 Curly's, 3 Shemp's, and 2 Joe's. I will still buy them, but I hope the quality goes up..."
1,Mystery of the Dwindling Stooges,"Regardless of the relative merit of the shorts on this disc, I'm giving it only one star 'cause Columbia has gone from giving us a usual six shorts (and a high of seven) on the other discs to only FIVE shorts on this one. A pie in the kisser to whichever genius at Columbia thought THIS one up..."
4,GREAT PRICE.... but...,"One of these shorts is twenty-seconds SHORTER, here, than on the ULTIMATE STOOGES' COLLECTION.But, T=H=I=S costs between $6 and a penny dependent upon it being in new or used condition.You'll be interested in this collection MOSTLY because of the LANGUAGE and subtitles though.ENGLISH/SPANISH/PORTUGUESE/FRENCH subtitles, withENGLISH/SPANISH/PORTUGUESE spoken-language audio tracks.You haven't heard anything till you've heard Curly say ""Woo woo woo... nyuck nyuck nyuck"" inPortuguese or Spanish!"
2,Cuidado: Lacks critical sections,"Hopefully the new version of this book is more complete than the last edition. The worst part was that there was no CD or tape for the listening sections. The students had to simply read them instead of hearing them or get someone!?!? to say them aloud. There was no practice at all for some of the sections that were on the test. I had to go to another book to find practice exercises for the missing sections. Students did like the explanations in the back of the book and usually did not need further help from me, but there are much better review books out there."
5,"Great functioning, well shaped CD player","Bought Emerson PD 5098 - CD player because it was upright and fits neatly on shelf or table. Love the feature of being able to pause it, then start if up again at same point OR turn it off and then click on advance button to bring it back to place I'd stopped. Often listen in the night -and find all operational buttons easy to locate and use in the dark. Have learned a vagary about CD players; Play easily most all commercial disks but choosey about home ""burned"" ones. By altering the ""burn,"" setting - audio or data, my Emerson is doing just fine.Tidy, useful CD player, for sure!"
2,Pretty Good Player,"My initial review gave only two stars, because the player froze up on me twice after owning it for about two weeks. Since then, it has been playing fine, and I have no complaints. I would now give it four stars. My two kids are able to use it with no help, and haven't broken it. It's mono, not stereo, but that's okay, since it's only for the kids to use. I wish it would play MP3s, but I'll take a reliable player over a feature laden player that breaks in less than six months. This is the first player that has lasted more than six months in a long time."
4,Fits the Bill...,"I bought this for my 5 year old and he's used it for 11 months now. It still works just fine. Sounds decent enough too considering [...]. He can't pull in as many radio stations as our other radio's but that could be because he has bent the antenna at some point. Either way, he loves listing to his music on it."
5,"GOOD SOUND, GREAT PRODUCT","THIS CD PLAYER IS SMALL, COMPACT, AND HAS GREAT SOUND. VERY REASONABLE PRICEI AM VERY SATISFIED. SERVICE WITH AMAZON.COM IS GREAT."
1,dead as a doorknob,i paid nearly $48 in total for this product and when i tried it it just was broken and doesnt even work. a complete waste of money. wouldnt recommend this item to anyone
2,Description is wrong,"This CD player works Ok and the sound isn't too bad but the description on Amazon is wrong. It says ""The 20-track programmable memory allows you to save your favorite songs on the player so you can listen to them without needing the CD."" Wrong. I bought it just for this feature but it does not do this. The programmable memory stores a list of the tracks in the order that you want to play them. It doesn't store the music itself. It still needs the CD to play the list. In fact, if you open the door to remove the CD, it erases the programmable memory!"
4,GOOD BASIC CD PLAYER,"This is a great little CD Player/Radio for camping or the beach. Not too big and I like the front load feature because it makes it slimmer so it uses less space than those big Boom Boxes.. Wanted something portable for a reasonable price. This was just what we needed. Not fancy but just right for basic listening.Don't know yet about battery life or how long it will last because I have had it for a short time. So far, So Good..."
4,Space saving,"I bought this CD player for it's size. We use it on our kitchen, where it fits nicely on a shelf.Aside from being a space saver, there isn't much to say about this unit. It plays CDs fine and hasn't had any trouble playing discs I've burned using iTunes. Being able to see the disc spinning is kind of cool.There are only two things I don't really like about this player: the AM/FM radio tuner and the volume control. The radio tuner is not digital, so you have to manually tune in a station every time you want to listen to the radio. It does seem to get pretty good reception though. The volume doesn't go up very high. Don't get me wrong, it's loud enough, it's just not loud enough for me to hear well from the other room. Of course, some might see this as a positive thing.Overall, I would recommend this CD player if all you need are bare bones CD player functions."
2,CD's skip,"I was quite disappointed with this product. I have owned other Emerson products in the past, and usually their products are of decent quality. The design and footprint were very nice, but the product didn't function as it should. I found that CD's (in good condition) will skip when the player has been playing for an extended period of time. Mine was playing steadily for about an hour or two when the CD's started skipping. I switched CD's twice, and the skipping just got worse."
2,Not As Good As I Expected,"I bought one for the boat because I like to listen to the radio when I am fishing. Worked great for that, got good reception and I was happy. Then I bought one for my desk at work where I like to listen to Cds. That was a mistake. It starts playing the cds and then just quits. It's really aggravating. I guess I should have tested the cds on the first one I bought because it acts up the same way.I would look elsewhere for a compact unit that does it all. The best part is that I did not spend a lot of money on these, but I guess you get what you pay for. But in this day and age, they should have worked better than they do..."
2,Terrible reception: Don't buy this is you plan to listen to the radio,"This radio is barely able to tune a station, despite many strong signals in the area. Worse, the one or two stations it can tune appear all over the dial. It's completely worthless as a radio. It also has no auxiliary inputs, so forget about connecting your iPod. Turns out, you can spend too little on a radio."
4,GOOD VALUE,"After shopping around and reading a lot of reviews of different portable CD players, including some about this very item that were not satisfied with sound quality, etc., we are finding this a good, average player for the kitchen counter. No, the sound is not like a home stereo system (would not expect it), but for primarily radio program listening and some music as ""doing chores"" background, it is quite good. In reading some of the reviews where people couldn't get it to play a CD, I am finding, at least so far, that when I push play, the CD spins and then stops and I'm taking this to be it's way or ""reading"" a disc there and then waiting for the next command. Another push and the CD is on its way. I've had no ""I won't play"" instances to date. If you want super high sound quality, etc., then you need something else. For everyday and general use, this is good value for the money."
4,"Lightweight & Easy to Transport, Just Be Careful with the AC Adapter","I purchased this cd player to play music cd's for a youth bible study class. I wanted something that was light and had a small footprint to make it easy to carry to and from the class room. This one works very well for that purpose! It is simple to operate and the sound quality is good for the price. A word of caution though; be careful when inserting the AC adapter. It's supposed to go in a certain way. I wasn't paying attention and attempted to plug in in the wrong way. The part inside broke off! Although Amazon was quick to replace the broken player with a new one (Thank You Amazon!), I was surprised how little pressure it took to damage the unit... Just make sure you insert the plug correctly and you should do well with this player."
4,surprising pleasure,i have been thru all the overly large cd players that are great sounding but are all too bulky for a truck dashboard. i listen everyday to blues jazz rock and talk shows i'm in my truck half my work day as a letter carrier. i make my own cd's. for one speaker on this emerson its pretty decent not tinny like most single speaker players. not loud like i'd like but once again decent it satifies. for the money i am happy i bought this even to the envy of some of my coworkers. 4 stars would give five if it would play louder but thats my idiosycnchrsy.
2,cd stopped after a year,"This was a satisfactory product, given the price, but the cd stopped after a year. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I expect a little better than that."
2,not worth the money,I dont think this is worth the money. Very flimsy and had to exchange it already once.
2,"CDs skip, stop","I was also disappointed in this item.. It played perfectly for about 4 months, and then the CDs started to skip, and within a month of that, it would just not play, as the CD spun around. Now I need to purchase another product. Not too happy about that. I will not get another that plays CDs vertically -- perhaps that's the problem?"
3,Disappointed,"Good reviews and product experience led me to buy two of these right off. While I would have preferred an MP3 hook up, the CD song program ability is what sold me on it. I have a small child who has an ever changing preference of songs she wants to listen repeatedly as she goes to sleep, and catering to that is beyond old.At first it was good, though the sound wasn't anything to brag about. But then the programming started to mess up and I was in the child's bedroom every hour fixing songs again just like before. The other one is still doing fine, but it never gets programmed, so maybe that was the underlying issue with the first one.Anyway, it's a decent enough CD player for occasional use or travel, but I would recommend investing in something more expensive if you want it to do more than just play the CD."
5,a little gem,"At last! a portable CD radio player that performs as it should... and I've suffered through several others.Sound is good (and better with Bose over-the-ear earphones since I am otherwise bothered by outside traffic noise). CD seems lasting. One caveat: the radio tuner dial is a bit stiff to manipulate, and one must dial it sensitively to find the right station. Otherwise, just what I needed!"
2,Fake CD,"This product is a big fake, that CD is to bad ,is not works ,I'm just used one day and no more works, I never buy again this product ,is a fake product .,just the radio works"
3,"Good Bargain, but mine died after 10 minutes, had to return","It is a good sized CD player with a three inch speaker. It played CDs with an average quality sound for a single speaker, but mine died after 10 minutes with a new CD, and would not play any CD after that. I had to retuen it for a refund. Mine was a bad one (just like you have a chance of getting in any department store with the same results), but yours may be better."
2,Had to Return It,"It would have been perfect except that the sound kept shorting out. I thought the cord was loose, but that wasn't the case and so it was unusable and I returned it."
2,Sturdy but bad sound quality,"I bought this to play music in my toddler's room. The sound quality is pretty bad, however it survived all kinds of abuse from my son playing with it, so I'll have to give it marks for that. No adult with normal hearing would want to use this to play music. It would be fine for something like talk radio."
5,Not bad at all,"I use this stereo/cd player at work, and it's perfect for what I need. It's kind neat looking and doesn't take much space at all on my desk when I push it against the wall. I really like it. I've had it for a couple months and so far everything works perfectly."
2,Emerson Radio/ CD player,I have had two of these. The first I returned because it would stop playing in the middle of a cd. The second one may or may not play depending upon whatever it seems to feel like doing. I was very disappointed in this product.
2,Emerson CD Player AM/FM Radio,"Great when I plug it in but with batteries, it keeps shutting off.What's up with this? I want to listen to CD's in the car."
1,Return to sender,"The CDs skip, it falls over easily, and the power cord doesn't stay in very well. This is on it's way back."
2,Stopped Functioning,"Outwardly, the radio has a great design. The size is right and it looks pretty sleek. Unfortunately, the CD player portion stopped functioning. It's been 14 months and the warranty is only for 12 months. Therefore, this radio is now useless to use since we used it entirely for it's CD capability. It simply isn't built to last."
3,Lasted for 18 months,"I bought this to play CD's at night in my twins' nursery. For the first couple of months, it worked perfectly fine. After around 6 months, the volume tuner went a bit wacky and I could only get it really low or really loud. Now, 18 months later, the motor for the CD player has died. In all fairness, we played it every single night for 18 months. It was stored high up so the kids did not have access to it. I think it just ran its course. I now have to purchase a replacement- but I am looking at other options."
3,Good for the price,"I got this little radio to replace two big, old boomboxes. The boomboxes are exactly the same except for some reason one picks up some stations the other can't. I wanted to get one radio to take the place of the two. This little Emerson gets good reception except for one station that I really like. So, I'm disappointed in that. But it is a nice compact size and the price was good for what I got."
4,Just What I Needed,"If you're looking for a Bose Wave Radio, then this is not the unit for you. If, however, you're looking for something to provide a little music or talk radio that isn't exactly audiophile quality, then this will be just fine. I can listen to a game while doing laundry, or play some music while getting ready for work and not worry about having to blast the stereo from another room. It's only $29, so what have you got to lose? It plays CD's fine. Radio reception is more than adequate. I'm happy with it and will likely buy another one shortly. Good stuff!"
1,never worked,"Within minutes, the antenae snapped off. The CD would start to spin and then just stop. It never would even play the CD. However, the return with Amazon was painless and easy! Zero for the product, five stars for Amazon!"
1,Hated It!,"I purchased this product on sale for $19.99....It is not worth $5.00 save your money. Volume button sucks & often can't be turned down. Very tempermental with CD's....plays one day but not the next, then plays again. Radio has lots of static even with antenna. Lasted about 8 weeks so I gave it to my Brother Mickey who collects junk."
4,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for. This was an inexpensive item that fills the bill. It does exactly what I wanted it for and does it well. I don't know what the long term performance is going to be, but I believe it will serve me well for what it was intended for a long time. It seems like a solid piece of equipment. I have had Emerson stuff before with no complaints and I do not suspect I will have any with this unit either."
2,Poor quality,"It didn't take long for the radio on this to conk out. It takes a lot of fiddling with the volume to get rid of the static. I use it mainly to play CDs for my toddler for sleeping, and that works OK. But I wanted to be able to switch to the radio during the day sometimes, and now wish I'd just gone with a higher-end iPod player."
3,Inexpensive but cheaply made,I bought this CD player for my daughters room for nighttime music. I needed something compact that played CDs.The first one I received was defective with the volume button not working as soon as I tried it. I returned it and received a replacement. The cord in the back doesn't fit well on this one but I decided to make it work rather than returning it.The sound quality is decent on the player and CD player is working.
2,Broke in less than 3 months & company was useless,"I bought this to play CDs for my baby to help him get to sleep at night. The sound wasn't bad. It wasn't expensive. The radio still works. But the CD player spins once and says error. It died less than 3 months after I bought it. When I contacted Emerson they said they would fix it but I had to mail it back at my own expense. To do that or even drive it back to the store where I got it would cost almost as much as the machine! Save yourself some money, don't buy this machine. There are cheaper and lighter radios out there if you just want a radio instead of a broken CD player."
4,"No frills, handy CD player, radio","This is a nice looking CD/radio combo for your office desk or kitchen table. The sound quality is OK for such a small unit, but this is not the product for you if you want to fill a big room with a full sound. I found the FM reception to be adequate. The unit can be run plugged-in or using two ""C"" cells. The latter makes it useful to have in the house for emergencies as a backup radio."
1,Piece of Garbage,"This worked well for a few months. Then I started having trouble getting the radio to play. You had to keep jiggling the bar that switched from AM to FM. The CD player still worked okay. Soon the radio wouldn't play at all and this was quickly followed by a failure of the CD player. It became, literally, garbage as I threw it out with the trash. I would give this zero stars if I could.A short while after I trashed mine, I noticed the same radio on a coworkers desk. She told me that hers no longer worked either. So mine was not a random incident."
4,The B Man,"I bought this unit ( Actually 2 ) for my office & home use.For the price,it plays remarkably well and I would not hesitatein purchasing another.Great unit, great price !!The B Man"
1,Absolutely awful,"I'm a little surprised by how awful this CD player is. Granted, it's cheap, but this is ridiculous. From day one, the sound quality on this unit was pretty mediocre. We heard some noise while playing a CD, and the sound was rather tinny. These problems progressed steadily. In the few months that we've owned it, it's become so bad that we now need to purchase another unit.Somehow, the speakers managed to blow out despite the fact that the ONLY thing we have ever played on this unit is a CD of lullabies. We use it every night for about 10 minutes to put our toddler to bed. This nightly 10 minutes of lullaby playing on LOW volume proved to be far too much for this unit to handle.Put your money toward something better. This thing is less than useless--it's now destined to rot in a landfill."
1,"Compact, but not functional","This one did not work right out of the box for me. The radio was functional, but the CD player was completely non-functional. It would give a weak spin, then give up. Obviously, you might be lucky and get a version that works, but it says something about the workmanship.The unit is light and compact and runs off battery or extension cord, which is nice, though it takes a ton of large batteries. The radio is analog, and it didn't seem to pick up great signal when I was running it in my kitchen despite having the antenna fully extended. I think the analog dial would be a little annoying in this day and age. The unit cheap and plastic-y looking."
4,Excellent for its level of quality.,"If you're looking for a simple radio/DVD player for the garage (what I'm using it for), etc....then this will work for you. No bells or whistles. You can fine tune a station in for good clarity and the volume is acceptable before distortion sets in."
3,Serves its purpose,"This unit did exactly as promised and what I wanted it to do. I needed cheap portable radio/CD player to move around the barn or in the field to listen to while working. I did not want an expensive radio/CD that would be expensive to replace in the event that dust and dirt got into the case and ruined the CD player. The radio is not digital and the volume level is somewhat low for the CD player. The unit comes with AC cord and can run on batteries. The quality of sound is poor, but this is expected in a less than $30 unit that I want to take into dirty areas. so for it has performed well and if CD player does get dirty and skips...no worry, just get another one of these at the low price. If you want concert hall performance,do not purchase this unit."
4,"Not top of the line, but works for what I need it for.","I bought this CD player for my daughter's nursery so that she can listen to music in her room. There are not many CD players to choose from these days so my options were pretty slim. I like this player because it is skinny and does not take up much room. I don't care too much for the front loading CD, but I can deal with it as it is better than having a big huge boombox taking up room on her dresser. This player also has AM/FM stereo and an antenna. This player works for what I need it for, a nursery. If you are looking for super high quality sound this player probably isn't for you. I think it sounds fine, but it does not have ""bass"" and all of that."
1,Worked Great -- For 3 months.,"The CD player worked great for about 3 months, then it just stopped working. I bought it because it seemed like a good price and the right size. Save your money and put it towards buying a higher quality, more expensive CD player."
1,Garbage,Do not waste your money on this. Within only 3 days the cd player no longer worked. After 5 days the speakers were shot. I bought it for the portable vertical cd player since space is an issue.(I listen to books on cd and cannot wear a portable device where I work) and there weren't many choices available so I went for the 'name brand' I got screwed. A total waste of money and time.
1,CD player doesn't work,Player arrived as expected. Checked AM/FM operation worked OK. Installed a CD but nothing happened. Read the manual but nothing I tried worked. The main reason I purchased it was for the CD. The unit CD does not work>
5,a rare good find,"perfect for child's room, simple enough for everyone to use. nice to find something that fits my needs so well"
4,good,"This is a good little CD player and radio. I picked it up very inexpensive on-line, and it serves the purpose. It's light and easy to move to where we need it."
1,Waste of Money,"Please save your money and get a CD player that actually works. I was enticed by the slim look of this player, but it is a lemon. The CDs had to be re-inserted over and over- they actually fell forward! then, when they stayed in place, they skipped, and ONLY in this player. Also the plug kept falling out of the back! But even with batteries, the dreaded skipping continued. If you need to save space, get one of the little round players where the CD rests horizontally- it may be a little wider, but at least it will play! I wish they had a negative star option, I'd give this a negative 5, as it now rests in a recycling yard somewhere."
2,Hard to Review,Although the product didn't work when we got it. We did love the size.. and Amazon service is the BEST. Returning it was EASY! Thanks Amazon.
1,Horrible player didn't last long,"I purchased this CD player about a year ago. It worked for a short time but now, with VERY low usage, it is practically useless. The volume knob will not allow fine adjustment - it goes to either really loud or really quiet. And the sounds shorts out completely while adjusting the knob. Sometimes while I'm in the middle of listening to the player, things will suddenly get very quiet. And then they will get loud again when I touch the volume knob or tap it a few times. I guess it's okay if you want to listen to the radio, but other than that it's not at all recommended."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This little machine only cost me about $25, so it did just what I expected it would do for that price. I took it to the beach with me and it worked perfectly when playing CDs and the radio. I got good reception from the stations. While it doesn't get as loud as I would have liked, the sound at lower volumes was good and pretty clear. However, when on maximum volume, the sound was kind of muddy. Also, when playing CDs, the player was kind of sensitive. The CDs tended to skip with minor movement of the player. It runs on AC, which has a decent length of cord, or 6 size C batteries. I put in 6 fresh batteries (Energizer) and after 4 hours of CD playing and 4 hours of the radio, the batteries were still going strong.If you're looking for something small, lightweight, and just enough sound for a small room, bedroom, or the beach or something, then this should work fine."
5,Excellent product,"Ordered the Emerson CD played one day and received it the next. Amazing how quickly we got it .... excellent quality and sound. For the money, you can't beat it."
1,CD player stopped working after one month!,I really liked this player until it just stopped working! The CD just spins and doesn't play....
2,It broke within a year,"We bought this seemingly quality yet inexpensive product in February 2011. In January 2012, without really much use, the CD player is broken although the radio still works. I probably played the CD player twice a day - in the morning and in the evening for total 2 hours. It never got dropped. Honestly, I was expecting it to break down earlier but the past reviews made me optimistic. Oh, well, I should have spent more money for a higher quality product made in a place other than China."
1,If I had original box I would return it,"The radio works fine, but playing cd's not so much.I have tried several cd's and they play up to a certain point, then stop.I have other cd players in my home that I play these cd's and they play fine so I know there is nothing wrong with the cd's.I wish I had saved the invoice and box it came in.I would return it.It is defective !"
4,GREAT LITTLE UNIT,I have one of these at home and purchased one for my mother-in-law. The CD player works great and sounds really good.The unit is easy to use.The only thing is the batteries last just a short while 6 C I believe and are expensive so I use the power cord instead.You must remember to hit the play button twice before the unit will play and also twice to get it to stop totally.If you have batteries in and do not disconnect the power cord it really drains them as the unit is still on.
5,Great Portability Without the Bulk,"If, as I do, you like to do house and yard work to the accompaniment of recorded books, you will find this unit provides good sound and easy portablity. Unlike bulky boom boxes, its sleek and ergonomic shape makes the Emerson PD5098 an attractive and inexpensive buy, fitting easily into tight spaces around the house. A minor related drawback is that its small footprint also makes it easy to accidentally knock over. I liked the unit so well that in case Emerson decides to stop making this model, I bought an extra just to stockpile for the future.Be aware that starting the CD is a two step operation. The player will cue up, counting the number of tracks and so on. After that's done, the CD will stop spinning. Then you push the play button and begin listening. Highly recommended."
1,Worked for 2 months,"The CD player broke after 2 months of mild use. I called Emerson customer service, and the representative was exceptionally rude and frankly did not care that their product was so poorly manafactured. I had the option of paying $18 shipping ($9 each way) to fix this horrible $30 item under the warranty. I might as well purchase a different product - at least then I won't be stuck with a piece of junk from Emerson."
3,portable cd/am/fm,"happy with the size, fits on desk at work...not happy with the dial for stations, unable to get alot of stations"
3,Emerson Cd player,"What can I say....you pay $30 and you get a $30 machine. This was for background music for gatherings at places with no music and worked just fine. The fidelity is only fair, it is monoaural, but it does the job."
1,Battery eater,The player does not keep track of where you were when the player is shut off.It goes through the 6 C cells in a few days.
3,Emerson pd5098 cd player,"This player has been in the hands of my mother-in-law for 2 weeks. The handle broke off the first week. The batteries make it too heavy to carry, thus the plastic handle pins gave way. So much for portable."
4,great gift,Purchased as a gift for a friend. This is one of the more compact sized CD players around and very easy to operate. I have not seen this player sold locally and glad I found this on Amazon.
2,Don't always get what you paid for,"The radio while looks decent and a space saving solution, the quality begs to differ.The first 2 days, the radio worked great but tuning to the right station can be difficult due to the small sensitivity. CD played fine.About less than a week in, the CD player refused to play any CD and if I could get the CD to play, it skips. If you plan to use it just for the radio, you won't really have any issues but I paid for both the radio and CD Player.So I end up return the radio."
4,Just what I needed,"I was looking for a small cd player to play misuc for my babies. This was perfect! small enough, works well, light, and most importantly makes me play those CDs that I haven't played in a long time (you know once you own and ipod and its speakers...)."
5,Emerson Portable Radio CD Player,Would reccommend this because it's small and just fits in my kitchen and barn. Radio sounds great and the CD'S are awesome to listen to.
4,Nite-time audio-book player,I chose this particular player for the size and use for me. I have a portable cassett player and I wanted a cd player only for audio-books. This works perfect for my nightstand.
1,disappointed,"This model only played one and a half CD's of my audio book before it went bad. The drive mechanism stopped, followed with erractic spins of a few seconds at a time or no movement at all. The radio still worked, so I don't believe there was a power problem. I gave up struggling with it and threw it away."
4,WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE,EASY TO USE. SOUND IS GOOD. PORTABILITY IS GREAT.AM & FM COME IN VERY WELL ALSO.CAN'T GO WRONG!
2,not really worth it,CD player doesnot play well standing up...cd started to skip with only the 2nd play
2,CD function stopped working after 6 months... disappointing,The CD function stopped working after 6 months but the warranty only covered the first 90 days.
2,Nice while it lasts,"I have the same problem with the CD player flaking out on me after 7 months for no particular reason. It literally just stopped working between taking out one cd and putting in another one, never to work again. The radio still works, but the analog station selection limits the selection I can get it since many of the local stations are clustered around the same frequencies.Still, particularly in terms of size and looks, it has been one of my favorite players. It makes it all the more frustrating that it's broken."
1,"Was great at first, garbage after just a few months","I was so excited about this CD player at the begining that I bought one for my mother in law as well. I had it in my babies' nursery and it served its purpose perfectly - light weight, good sound and cheap. But you get what you pay for. After a few months it stopped working. Tracks would skip or not play at all. Now I have to buy another brand."
2,cd broke down,CD never played all the time ===had to restart many times.now after a couple of months it does not play at all.
1,Save Your Money,Basically if you agree with everything the current administration is doing your a great American and if you are critical of the current direction America has taken your a traitor. It's Patriotic to criticize Democrats and un American to criticize Republicans. If you love right wing hate radio you'll love this book. If you have a functioning brain save your money.
3,I expected better from these authors,"I wanted to like this book - but it turned me off pretty quickly .. Recycling Ann Coulter's assertion that ""The Left"" ""Hates America"" is unproductive hyperbole.And stating that poverty isn't bad in the US because it's not as bad as it was during the Depression or is in Calcutta is a bit disingenuous.Also, using quotes from idiots like Woody Harrelson, who don't really represent mainstream liberals, seemed like a cheap shot.I was hoping for some good arguments - some of which were there, but the overall tone of the book was diminished by looking at the most extreme, nonrepresentative characters that the authors could dig up. (That's the same reason people hate Michael Moore, isn't it?)I was encouraged that at the end of the book, the authors point out that education is the way to get back to the America we all love. Maybe both camps in Washington can make that a priority ....."
4,Made me feel better about things,"The authors put recent events in perspective with facts and insightful thinking. A great alternative to the mass media ""spin""."
4,Cheesy and Irresistable,"Ok, ok, I know it's cheesy but it's also irresistable fun. It's Trollope the Victorian as produced by Aaron Spelling (who knew?)starring that incredibly perky Susan Hampshire. Don't be surprised if you find yourself reveling in the shenanigans of the less sympathetic characters, and if it turns out your favorite continuing snide commentator is Dolly Longstreet, just pour yourself a sherry, adjust your monocle and sit back to wait for the third and final series. And thank goodness Penelope Keith lost all that weight."
2,Little content but professional,"Having bought about a dozen other dance DVDs from Amazon, I was dissapointed with this one. All though Vicki Regan's DVD is very professional, the instructors are excellent, all smiles and very encouraging for the student the reality is that the amount of content is very lacking. After learning everything on this DVD you will know enougg Rhumba to dance for about 30 seconds and then you will have to start repeating yourself. In comparison to other Amazon DVDs and other instructors the content is significantly less. If you buy cheap then you get cheap. If I had to do it again I wouldn't have bought this DVD."
3,Good for the beginner,"Good for the beginner, but my wife was looking for something more advanced. Simple, easy to follow steps and instructions. If you are starting out with dance, this is a good one."
5,great video,I have enjoyed rewatching these westerns from my youth. Jock Mahoney was always a favorite action star with his natural grace and athleticism.
3,Product Features statement is incorrect.,"The product features says ""Box of 100"". This is actually a box of 20. There are 4 locking and 16 non-locking lugs. The tool sent with the kit is for the locking lugs and will also work with the 12mm hex of the non locking lugs. I'm skeptical of how long the tool will last since the contact points in the 12mm lug is minimal. I bought this set to do two cars. Now I'll have to buy another set. I thought I was getting this great deal. Turns out it really wasn't a deal at all."
5,WOW!,"Wow is all I can say about Shawn Desman's first cd, it is absolutely amazing, it is one of those cds that you can listen to without skipping any tracks and just listen to over and over again. I love track 15 ""Superman"", its wonderful. He sings, he dances and write his own music, what more could anyone ask for! He's also gorgeous!"
1,Oh no. Please no more.,"My dissection here will start with a simple rhetorical question. Who exactly is buying the records and watching the video's that keep this guy a viable product? Can I even imagine what a Shawn Desmond fan would look like? Nave 15 year old girl, going through a brief, choreographed dance stepping, bad boy phase?Poorly masquerading as a slick R & B crooner, he puts face to the universal, early 20's, High School cruising, suburban dance club Nancy-boy; another racially confused and culturally alienated white kid. Luckily enough for everyone except MuchMusic Canada, this guy will go unnoticed due to his Canadian identity and his rather unfortunate lack of talent and dignity."
1,Blah,"I can't believe this album got 4 and 5 star reviews. Please save your money on something else. There's far better Canadian ""r&b"" than this. Get Glenn Lewis instead. He's real r&b."
5,Fine Quality,For the money can't beat it.Stabila give you what you need in a manual adjusting laser level.Good package.Detector is real nice.
4,Of great interest becouse of my lineage,"I am third generation Icelandic, all of my grandparents immegrated to america in the late 19th century. They were all: ""west coast Icelanders"" Reading Fergus's book was of especial interest because my maternal grandmother [Holmfrethur Hansdottir] was born on Oct 20, 1860 at: Litliahrauni, Iceland, the exact site of Little Lava in this book. I have a journal writen by her husband in 1930 that spells out this history. I would like to send a copy of this journal to Mr. Fergus if I can get his address. Thank you."
4,Nice little trimmer,"I've had this trimmer now for 2yrs, and it's satisfactory for hedges and topping off shrubs. It doesn't handle branches thicker than a 1/4 inch. I plan to buy another trimmer, and it will definitely be a B&D. They make great products. This one is great for small jobs, but not so for thicker branch shrubs."
3,Does ok on smaller bushes,This works well if you have smaller hedges to trim. Anything more than half an inch thick and this thing completely locks up. It's ok for light duty.
5,Hedge Trimmer is a Great Buy,"I would recommend this product. I have a lot of underbrush that has been slowly taking over my yard. With the Black and Decker 17 inch hedge trimmer, I am taking my yard back. Thank you Amazon! Great price for a great product!"
1,Does not cut but hacks,We received a TR1700 trimmer as a replacement for our old Black & Decker electric trimmer. The blade is just stamped steel and does not cut but hacks small shrubs. I would recommend spending more and getting a better model.
2,Low Powered Rhodiola for the Elderly,"I'd say that this is a fine product for perhaps an 80+ year old senior citizen who might be rocked by using a quality Rhodiola. When I tried it, I thought that this stuff just doesn't have much ""oomph."""
5,Excellent work of the editor,"This is the best edition in the Arden collection I have read until now, by Charles Forker. Very helpful to understand meaning with clear footnotes and a serious introduction in which, for example, you learn about historical and fictional facts in the play, and many other clues.I agreed with a reviewer of another Arden work who said: ""The text itself is full of stumbling, often unhelpful endnotes - what students surely want are explanations of difficult words and figures, not a history of scholarly pedantry. The edition concludes with textual appendices.""It happened to me before but fortunately not in this work, which is excellent. The editor makes the difference. I hope Arden Series follows this line!"
5,Genius,"This is one of my favourite plays. Richard is one of the great Shakespearean characters, and his fall is perfectly rendered. This is a play everyone should read."
3,Weak here and there but not bad.,"While Mike Aiken's life might be enviable, I don't know if his music can make the same statement. I've listened to the CD a number of times and in Simon Cowell's words it is ""Forgettable"". It isn't a bad CD but it isn't catchy and you don't rush to hear it again. The melodies are simplistic and the lyrics while not weak, aren't memorable. It would make good background music."
5,Must read,"A ""must read"" for anyone interested in jazz, music, nostalgia, or a great real life story. It's worth buying just for the photos. Wein is a major cultural icon of our age."
4,Frank and enjoyable.,"Wein crams as much as he can into this memoir, and his writing about his early years (from boyhood to military service) is oddly more rewarding for this reader than his remembrances of his later years as producer/pianist/club owner. But it's all good. and certainly worth the low price it sells for these days from various vendors."
3,"&#65533;Things were different, then. Better, ??? Slower for sure.&#65533;","A great book to read when you have time to relax and remember how we used to ocean race. Having sailed with Bobby Symonette in an SORC aboard FUN in the early `60s and knowing Cleody Snaith and Bucky Reardon, two of the other young characters aboard, helped make the book come alive. At times the author pontificates for several pages on various topics that add to the flavor of the book, but make it a slow read. In Mort Weintraub's words ""Things were different, then. Better, ??? Slower for sure."""
3,Don't know how accurate this is...,"This movie is rather slow and doesn't tell how both Wesley brothers were married. In this movie, they are still single at the end of the movie. A rather strange take on the Wesley brother."
3,Not Bad for Semi-Pro,"The movie does not have the Hollywood polish (not necessarily a bad thing). The acting is believable. Locations are good. Limited extras means small crowds - not the thousands Wesley preached to - and certain faces show up at different places. And the sound person had a real love affair with bird calls.Other than that, the story is told well. The relationship between John and Sophie is extended and fairly believable, as is Wesley's obnoxious personality. The movie does tell the tale and dramatizes the shift from the movement being vilified to accepted. It is just not on a par with the movie ""Amazing Grace,"" that dramatized Wilburforce."
2,Not for UK market,"I was keen to see this being a member of the Methodist church in London, however very disappointed when viewed as this is very much an American film with American actors. Little evidence of the undoubted charisma Wesley must have possessed. There were some silly scenes with very amateur minor character performances, and the film frankly failed to engage me at any point. Clearly we must continue to await a film which does justice to a fascinating and passionate subject."
1,To much exposure,The story spends much time showing wesley discovering what it means to put his faith in Christ. But what puzzles me is why the film shows so much of his girlfriends chest with a low cut dress. The film seems to be a college made film.
1,Disappointed,"This story would have been excellent, if it hadn't been for the way his girl friend was dressed in the first part of the movie. The first part of the movie focused way too much time on the girl he almost married. She wore the same dress most of that time, which was so low cut, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Too bad, because the last half of the movie was excellent, showing how Weley's life was turned around after he'd gotten saved. After this experience, his works were done because he was saved, and not for the sake of gaining salvation."
3,Wesley: A Heart Transformed Can Change the World,"This dramatization has some basis in the important facts about Wesley, but is hardly a scintillating drama about the life of a man that actually did have some dramatic elements in it. Too much coverage of the time he spent in Georgia, which amounted to about five percent of the life of this interesting religious leader."
2,A good movie but could have been better,"A good movie but it left out some very important milestones in the life of Mr. Wesley. Far too much time wasted describing his relationship with Sophie Hopkey while other important relationships were neglected. No mention made of his marriage. Mr. Wesley was 5'3"" tall & weighed 128 lbs. The actor portraying him was a tall, solid built man who towered over others in the film. Unrealistic. Barely touched on the far reaching changes his ministry had on eighteenth century England & on the establishment of the Methodist Church in the U.S."
4,Wesley is well worth watching!,"OVERALL I FOUND THIS VIDEO TO BE INSPIRING! It is a thoughtful and educational film, sensitively and skilfully portrayed by the lead characters. If you find it a bit slow-moving at first, stay tuned--it picks up and keeps moving until the end. A must for those interested in the Wesleys, the history of the Church of England, how the Methodist church was started, and for anyone who is struggling with the way of salvation in the Christian faith."
5,Heart Strangely Warmed,"I really enjoyed this movie on John Wesley and I showed it to a Fellowship Hall full of Methodist people. They loved it too. While a low budget film, it had all the ""feel"" of Hollywood blockbuster. Wesley only covered the life of Wesley through mid-life and stopped short of the Methodist movement in America. Some people were disappointed with that. All in all, the movie did a good job portraying John Wesley and his heart being strangely warmed."
1,I would give this toy a 0 out of 5 but there is no 0!,This toy is retarded! Don't waste your money on this peice of crap. It falls apart every time you try to put in the bullet thing. I mean when you but in the bullet his arm falls off. Then when you try to put his arm back on the freickel leg falls off. Its a contenuing cycle of peices falling off. So instead of buy this for yourself or children buy a nice Steve Stevens Flaminco A Go-Go album. Buy it NOW!
4,Worth the cash,"With the exception of some of the samples and talking tracks, this album is pretty dang good. I just got it last night (never hearing any of the songs before) and I'm already singing along.The Sun Also Rises, Binary & Estrella are great tunes. Enamel is by far my favorite track. Buy this CD!"
1,My baby hates it,"I agree with the above review. This item is poorly designed.Designers at I agree with the above review. This item is poorly designed. Designers at Maclaren probably never placed a baby in this rocker. If they did then, they never bothered to change the basic design flaw i.e. that the toy bar is badly designed to be placed on the rocker. It is difficult to get the baby in & out of this rocker the toy bar and the canopy.Also, my baby hates the vibration that the Maclaren rocker provides.she cried whenever we tried to put her in the rocker. She loves the hanging toys the dog, the rabbit & the elephant.She loves the Fisherprice rainforest bouncer."
1,Very badly designed,"This rocker is badly designed and cheaply built. For example, it is very uncomfortable to get the baby in and out of it. More importantly, the front handle only holds as long as the hood is in place. If the hood gets out of its base, then the whole handle folds and detaches from the chair. This is extremely dangerous and it is very hard to understand how the guys at Maclaren missed it.Avoid."
5,Starsailor,"Two words: Coming Down.This entire DVD is brilliant and i got my copy for only $21, but now i know how fantastic it is, i would have happily paid $50 for it. Every single performance was great, including a song i'm not even particularly fond of - Fever.But the standout of this DVD has to be James Walsh, alone on stage, doing Coming Down. The crowd is silent, and the entire scene he sets is truly heart-wrenchingly honest.I cannot praise this DVD enough. Five Stars."
1,Great for cutting 43 degree angles,"I got this as a simple miter box from Grizzly because the one I made was not quite accurate enough for me. Too bad it actually was way worse than my crappy home made one. You can obviously see without pulling out a protractor and t-square that all of the guide slots are cut CROOKED! I cut a few cuts, measured them with my combo-square protractor and they were 43 degrees, or 47+ degrees depending on the slot you used. Even the 90 was off about 1.5 degrees. Then I put a t-square to the miter box and it was clearly off about an eighth of and inch from the top of the slot to the bottom. Don't bother with this pitiful excuse for a miter box, buy a chop saw or make one yourself."
1,did not like,sent back. too small for any useful purpose. i was nice it was aluminum but it needed to be bigger
2,Large Miter Box???,Bought this miter box thinking since it was a large I would be able to cut just about anything with it.NOT.The box does not even fit a 2x4.Not even close.I would hate to see the small miter box! Did not work for me.Sent it back.
4,Neat little stocking stuffer.,"This is my first Zoid in years. Only had the old stuff. My gf bought it for me when I was in Wal-Mart when I said I used to play with those things.It was pretty easy to build. I'd say 20 mins. Less if you don't take your time to file down the rough spots. What's really good is that missle launcher really goes far. They give you an extra missle. It also have this load position, where if you press the lever, it doesn't fire, but it also doesn't fall out. Good for display storage. However, there doesn't seem to be much movement in this model. The outter shell might have something to do with it. They could have done something better witht the feet.It actually comes with the watch-cell batteries it needs, so that's a bonus. I found that there were a ton of decals, and not really enough smooth areas to place them. Neat toy, but I guess it's mostly a expansion thing. But for the price, who cares. You're buying the cannon to put onto something else.w."
3,My rating for this fossil watch,I thought this watch looked nicer on the website that in reality. I think the band would be nicer in white.
1,save ur $$$$$,"I bought this set + several other 18v tools all at same time, what a mistake.Tools themselves work great IF THE BATTERIES hold their charge. Save yourself the headachs of frequent re charging n buy the DeWalt tools, you will be happier in the long run."
4,"One very good idea, seven merely good ones.","As business books go, it's typical. It starts with a simple premise, adds several good supporting points as it goes, beats the whole thing into submission with example and anecdote, and then closes with some fairly safe crystal ball work.It does narrowly focus on business blogging: current state-of-the-art, history, and future implications. It doesn't raise many new points that aren't familiar to those deeply involved, but it's about the best primer I've seen on the subject -- and I've read a bunch of them as part of my job on theworkingnetwork.com.Go for the electronic version."
2,Not deep enough,"I approached this book realizing that I knew too little about blogging. Having finished the book I know some more but I wish that ""return on time"" could have been higher.This book falls in the category ""airport literature"", i.e. written for managers who like to be updated on topics and lingo. I realize that the phenomenon is new but I wish that authors addressing the issue could have spent more time researching it before they tell their personal story. I would love to learn more about blogging relative to branding, word-of-mouth, relationship management, and marketing research by listening to customers. This book only scratches the surface in this respect.Bottom line: there is still room and time to develop a better book that covers this important and relevant topic more thoroughly."
4,Makes you think,"Naked Conversations gives the great background information for anyone new to Blogs and their impact. The examples and links are powerful examples to anyone considering tipping their toe into the rising waters of blogs.From a technicians point of view, I also enjoyed the book. I enjoy any book that makes me think. This book made me think of other ways blogs would be valuable to the business and IT ""inherit friction."" Because of this book, I'm testing my theory.I LOVE BOOKS THAT SPARK IDEAS! Read this book and have your own spark initiated."
4,One of its kind,"I've been looking for literature about blogging, but this is as far as I can understand the only one on the market. The authors Robert Scoble and Shel Israel really know what they are writing about. Maybe it's a bit too much about the ""giants"", (Microsoft for example) and how they are using blogging to increase their profit.I've been looking for the answer on the question: How do I pitch bloggers? The answer I found was: They'll write about issues if they are remarkable. But how do I present the pitch? Still looking for advice...Monica"
4,Very Helpful,"As a novice blogger and blog reader, I found this book to be a very helpful initiation into the culture of blogging. While the authors can be a bit ""preachy"" at times, they do get their message across and I find that their views on what blogging is all about ring true.If you are already out there in the blogosphere, you will probably not find anything new here. However, if you are just getting your start, and especially if your business is just getting its start in blogging, this is an important book to read."
4,Every Marketing person should read this book,"Blogs are another way of marketing a company's products and services and drawing folks into the raison d'etre for the company doing certain things, or going in a certain direction. Websites offer information, but no dialog.My take on this book is that .. this is a must read for every Marketing person. Blogs have a huge potential for making companies look human and help sell products.The book is very 'straight from the heart'. You can see that all over the place :). These guys are really into blogging and passionately so.The industry examples are very good. Google and Apple not encouraging blogging was a big surprise."
4,good quality basic hedge trimmer,"This is a good size for my few foundation hedges. I would purchase a much larger model if you are planning on doing a lot of hedging, as the 18 inch model requires many passes to complete your job."
4,Black & Decker 18 inch Hedge Trimmer,"The service was very good. Shipment was prompt. I have not been able to use the item yet, but I'm assuming it will work fine. Thank you"
3,loose ends not wrapped up,"The plot does not hold together. It requires a whole string of very rare events to happen, some of them on the spur of the momen, and in the proper sequence. The absence of the dental office manager is never explained even though the absence is necessary for the plot to work. How does a total stranger learn of a woman's relatives, their residence, and their health condition? Why would a dentist have a vial of adrenalin? Why did not the police and Poirot not notice the lack of powder burns?"
3,For young readers only.,"""For Conspicuous Gallantry"" is a good introduction for young readers to the Medal of Honor and to some of the decoration's receipient through most major conflicts. Well-illustrated, it will hold the interest of younger history buffs, but it is not comprehensive at all. Cooke chooses a few stories from each major conflict the US was involved in to provide a backdrop for the Medal's history. If you're looking for a complete history of the Medal and background on all of its receipients, steer clear of this book."
1,Please Don't Buy this Book,"This book has harmed so many people. I would ask people to boycott it. It was written by two people with no qualifications whatsoever. They are not doctors. They are not psychologists. They are not psychiatrists. One was a creative writing teacher and the other was her student. This book has encouraged the belief that flashbacks of alleged abuse ""recovered"" later in life in therapy or while under altered states of consciousness(which are often false memories) are as legitimate as actual abuse always recalled. So many familes have been destroyed by false accusations. I have read this book and I believe it definitely has done more harm than good. Please avoid it at all costs."
3,Cautious recommendation,"This book is a valuable tool for survivors of sexual abuse; however, I would like to caution readers. Reading this book can be a very painful, traumatic experience. I recommend reading it with the support of a survivor support group or therapist. This book is not for everyone, so consult fellow survivors or your therapist first. However, it is still an important book because it is one of the few written solely for women survivors of sexual abuse."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"This book read my mind... this book knows me... this book is unimaginable help... I cried for so long for help, and, simple enough, here it is.. It was all of my emotions that I've bottled up and locked away and threw away the key- this book made me try to find the key and unleash everything... kinda like cleaning out the closet... scary enough, I decided to go through it anyways- I feel like a NEW person- strong, healthy, and beautiful new self-esteem!"
5,It takes courage!!,"It takes courage, and an understanding that one deserves to live a better, more fulfilling life than one has because of the child hood sexual abuse that was endured. I would recommend this book to everyone trying to work through the effects of child sexual abuse. Definitely a useful book in the professional field of counseling."
1,Interested in thies book? check out lawsuit against Diane Humenanski,My daughter was given this book to read by then dr. Diane Hunenanski. This was in the late 1980s. This and other books helped form the FALSE revovery of memory movement. Satanic ritual abuse etc. I met and talked with Humenanski myself. I have never had a conversation that strange with anyone I have ever met. I was very afraid for my daughter and was able to get her out of the clutches of this destructive woman and the distructive thinking. Humenanski finally had her liscense revoked and paid out over 2 million in damages. Google her name for full information on her ideas and the lawsuit. Handle book with Care!!!! potentially dangerous I am very disappointed to see that the ideas in this book are still floating around. I do not minimize sexual abuse!!! But please seek reliable counsel.
4,Good for people who want to heal on their own,Gave good examples and guideline for people who maybe don't want to talk about healing with others.
3,"Helpful, but not helpful","This book has helped me realize little things I do, certain actions, etc. But my biggest complaint is they tend to focus on sexual abuse by a parent or grandparent, that is on a totally different plane than sibling. This book is based around the fact that parents and grandparents are the abusers. So if you are just seeking help, or just starting to come to terms with your abuse, I'd recommend this book. However, if your abuse was by a sibling be prepared for continuous ""parent"" ""grandparent"" abuse."
5,"Don't listen to ""Don't......Stop!""","No matter what she/he says, this book is ok great help to people who have been abused. Most of us have no clue how to deal with our problems that are a direct result of sexual abuse. Most of us are too afraid to go to a support group because we can't even begin to deal with the intense emotions that surround us. Most of us can't open up to a group of strangers let alone our families/loved ones or even ourselves depending on how deep the hurt goes. For those of us who need to begin to deal with the abuse on our own level, the book and workbook will help because you can work at your own pace rather than be forced to talk about something that may be too painful. I know I deal with things better by myself at first until I can get my emotions in order and separate the anger from the pain."
5,great,thank you so much for having this. i really need this. great. on time. what i wanted. i will order again
5,"Finally, I see my thoughts on paper.",I read this book about 5 years ago. I had many indications and a strong feeling that I may have been sexually abused but no memories. This book was recommended to me when I asked a counselor how I could deal with this issue. When I read the book I felt so relieved. It was like seeing my own thoughts on paper. I underlined the parts that I really related to. This book supported what I was already feeling but it did not put new thoughts into my head. When any severe trauma occurs your mind might protect you by forgetting. But not everyone forgets. I got no specific memories as a result of reading this book. I learned so much by reading this book. It gave me reassurance to seek out the kind of help I needed to work through this issue. It was written so well too - down to earth and understandable. I would definitely recommend this book.
1,"Idiodic, Amateur Drivel That Destroys Lives","This book has been totally discredited by psychiatrists. That it's even allowed on bookshelves is a testament ONLY to our freedom of the press. It is written by amateurs with no qualifications whatsoever, other than their creative writing ability.This book has done permanent harm to patients, families and even psychiatric practices. In a hundred years from now, this book will be included with the genre of books that inspired the Salem Witch Hunts. A false accusation is all that is needed to destroy a life.I have read this book and implore anyone seeking help, to please get help from a LICENSED psychiatrist with no hidden agenda. This book would be the most expensive $16 you would EVER spend."
1,PLEASE DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!,"This book is manipulative, ignorant, full of lies, and even dangerous. It starts out to be a compassionate piece of work that is focused on helping the victims of sexual abuse recover and come to terms with what has happened by helping them to uncover ""repressed memories""I read this book out of curiosity, and was appalled by it. It teaches women to blame all their problems on repressed memories of abuse, even if there's no evidence that abuse happened. It asserts that ""if your life shows the symptoms of abuse, then you were abused."" That is not true, and is not to be believed.This book has the ability to trigger a multitude of false memories in people, which can shatter lives and families. Please do not waste your time reading this book!"
5,Absolute must for women on the healing journey!,"The journey to wholeness for those traumatized by childhood sexual abuse is a difficult one. Finding supportive people and literature can be the most important part in making your way through the process. Ellen Bass and Laura Davis have created an anthology on the subject that supplies never-ending resources and support. ""The Courage to Heal"" walks with the survivor, supports them in each stage of healing, provides countless sources of reading and other study. I have never found another book that can equal the work of Bass and Davis in its ability to address literally every issue that could possibly come up along the way. I have not found another book that gave me so much courage and hope! I read it for the first time five years ago, and continue to refer to it each time I need more support."
1,BAD SCIENCE,"I think this book has caused a lot of needless pain. I don't address these ideas to those who have always had memories of their abuse, however:Any book that encourages people to believe they were abused with absolutely no concrete evidence is DESTRUCTIVE. Any book that encourages people to get as angry as they possibly can, as sad as they possibly can, and let their abuse define them and take their lives over is destructive. This book has been successful because people feel empty and confused, and they need something to hang onto. How does it help to decide all your problems are caused by abuse in your childhood? This is NOT the answer."
5,this book was and is an integral part of my healing journey.,"without work like this to guide survivors in the early stages of healing, i imagine survivor suicide rates would be even higher. i still find this book an incredible resource 9 years into my healing journey for not only me but my loved ones as well."
1,Caused more Pain; Healed nothing,"A well intentioned boyfriend once gave me this book; however, it did far more harm then good. There are constant lesbian diatribes, a focus on bringing more horror to the surface, and nothing helpful. I am glad there were some people that had a good expereince with this book; however, I was not one of them."
1,Book review,"I have been a victim of childhood sexual abuse. I have been in therapy and have read a few books. This book is not about healing. If you are looking for peace, to forgive your abuser and get your self-esteem and your power back, this book is not for you.I don't know how many times I read the word ""[...]"" in this book, but once was too much. In my opinion, this book is filth..."
3,Approach With Caution,"This series has helped literally thousands - which is both its grace, and its liability. Too many survivors reach for this book as their first step in self healing - and are quite literally overwhelmed. Though the authors use cautions responsibly, frightened and/or desparate people may ignore them and ""read on"". For a person who is stable enough to provide basic self care, has a support system, and for the severely injured a therapist as well, it is helpful. For others, it can injure. I firmly believe that such cautions should be listed in this review section."
5,The book validated my feelings and made me feel less alone.,"I have recently had trouble with my parents after breaking my 25 years of silence about my older brother's incest of me. My parents denied it, said it wasn't his fault, said he's changed, that I should forgive him and that it wasn't that bad. Having read your book gave me confidence in my own feelings, made me doubt myself less and also helped me feel as if I was part of the world again instead of an outcast. Certain parts of the book I read over and over again. I also read the book out loud to my husband. I sometimes have a hard time putting my feelings into words. When reading many parts of the book I have thought, ah ha, yes this is exactly how I feel and then was able to explain my feelings to my husband. Portions of the book are like lights shining in on my feelings which allow me to recognize and acknowledge my feelings. This is an excellent book for survivors. Thank you so much."
5,"Giselle, DVD",This ballet was wonderful in both the dance and the music. I was spellbound from the overature to the finale. The camera positions and the overall technical production provided wonderful perspectives of the performance.I highly recommend this production.
4,Natural Ice Rocks,Natural Ice is the best lip balm on the market! It even works better on preventing cold sores than actual cold sore products.I only gave 4 stars to the 'Sport' Natural Ice as it is more shiny when it goes on and does not seem to absorb as quickly as the 'Original' Mint Natural Ice. The Original Natural Ice should be sold in stores and you should buy enough to keep one in every pocket!
3,"Generally good, VERY JARGONISTIC, but too misleading.","This book is good, it contains a lot of VERY detailed information about the chip, and the included CD is a good idea, but in the end it seems like an AMD advert, claiming a great increase in speed and other wonders which are in fact like Intel's MMX extention, OVER HYPED!!! How many pieces of software do you see writted especially for MMX? I have seen 1, G-Nome and that was only average. (No offense meant to G-Nome writers etc) And Intel had the money to market it with those dancing spacemen. (This was an English advert, if it didn't come out in america then you won't understand) Perhaps it was bad timing with 3DFX coming out with it, but point taken. Overall, good book, but you have got to tell the truth haven't you?P.S., I have one of these chips and it is really good, cost wise I would recommend it over a PII system anyday.K6-2 275.78PII 399.99"
1,Skeptical cont'd,"I would like to append to my previous comments to provide further clarity.While the object file containing instruction code will be stored in RAM, the MPU will use a decoder or look-up table to handle the instruction. This hardware will not be changed."
4,Works really well for small areas,"This is a great blower for lightweight items (such as pine needles, leaves, etc.) - provided that they're dry and not built up with dirt, etc. Then you have to spend a bit more time on those areas, but even still, this is a great blower for the money. We use it about 10-20 times per year and have had it for more than 2 years; no complaints. 4 stars instead of 5 because dancing with the power cord is no fun!"
1,Black and Decker FT1000 Blower,"My blower lasted one season and quit. The motor requires replacement as the parts cannot be ordered to replace those that require fixing. I tried ordering from different sites online and they only sell the entire motor, not components. I can purchase a new blower for substantially less than the cost of having it repaired. I'm very disappointed with B&D and will try another brand."
4,Just enough,"Very light and the flex hose make it a breeze (no pun) to operate. Not alot of air power, but just enough for the area that we need it for. Lost my first one in Katrina, Amazon had the replacement."
4,good leaf blower,"Good product, not as powerful as it boasts. But it's a good, relatively quiet leaf blower."
1,Not the book it's claiming to be!,"The book nursery tales children love contains different stories! This book is by the same author but its called ""Children of other lands"" and is for sale under the correct title for like $4, I felt that I was TOTALLY MISLED into buying a book I didn't want or need! Worse is the fact that I didn't get the book I wanted in time for the event I wanted it for!"
5,BEST ALBUM EVER!!!!!!,"I listen to all types of gospel music. I have underground and mainstream gospel. I have classical, urban, traditional, and ""hip hop"" gospel music. After years of purchases I must say Sunny Hawkins has the best cd I have ever heard. I can listen to every song without skipping (that's a feat for me). Her vocals are umcomparable. Sunny's range is crazy, from Lisa McClendon's alto to Karen Clark-Sheard's contrasoprano. She can jazz it up like Anita Baker and rock out like Toby Mac. This is one purchase that I do not regret."
4,Solid music with a solid label!!,"A Gospel ""Jill Scott."" Actually, she is on the same label that Jill's first album is on. I really enjoy this music when I first get home from work with my family."
4,works as described,"product is very simple to assemble, and comes exactly as described. i thought it would of been a bit brighter, but good enough for ambient lighting."
5,"Easy to install, will purchase more.","I'm using this 6' set as under-the-cabinet lighting above my computer desk. The light is definitely not bright, but definitely helps to relieve eye strain by giving just enough background light behind my monitors. I will definitely buy more of these. I want to try some of the longer sets outside, around some landscaping. I think it will look great."
1,A very disappointing outcome,"The product appeared to be exactly what we needed for our application, but only for the first two hours of operation. At that point, roughly half of the 6-foot length went dark. Our efforts to restore the item to full operation were fruitless, and in the future, we will look elsewhere for this sort of lighting need."
3,Well. . .,"This product did not provide the amount of light I expected.This could be my fault, as it is not placed so that the light is contained, rather on top of a wall (8' high). I am assuming it is my fault not the fault of the product."
3,Not as bright as I would have liked.,"I planned on mounting this behind my entertainment center to provide some ambient light when the rest of the lights are off and I'm watching a movie. I was hoping for something a bit brighter, and a bit whiter. The light that comes off this is distinctly yello w- not like a white LED, more like an old incandescent light bulb. The color temperature is warm, so it's a nice ambient light, but it's a little too dim to be much help as an ambient light. I should have bought it from a B&M store so I could have seen it in action first. Lesson learned."
4,I love my lights ...,"I love my rope lights for soft lighting in my home. These are great, except I can expect them to fail in some section or anotherafter a period of time. But sometimes they last for years. I will keep buying them."
4,Shaken not Stirred,"After loosing 2 hours of my life reading reviews in order to get the right hedge trimmer, I settled on the HT2200. My results of one day's urban hedge trimming are:1. Cut the small stuff fine. Got hung up on anything tuff (say 1/2"" diameter and knobby). No big deal, simply cut those main branches with snips from my pocket.2. The weight and reach were fine.3. The cut quality was fine.4. It is very jerky, with many vibrations.On the whole ... it works and has no bells and whistles. I am satisfied (see below).My Search:-Requirements: Trimmer that works, won't wear out in the next 10-15 years. Nothing fancy.-Didn't want cordless from fear of battery life not lasting 10-15 years.-Didn't want the ""double action"" Black and Deckers due to all the bad reviews on them getting dull. I.e. won't last the 10-15 years I want.Best regards,Kevin"
2,"It works, but . . .","My old (meaning over 15 years old!) B & D electric trimmer gave up the ghost last week, so I decided to replace it today with a newer model. The HT2200 is much lighter than my previous trimmer, which was great news. It also easily cut through my evergreens and magnolia bush. So far, so good. Next, the bad news: as soon as I moved over to my rather large arborvitae (about 8 feet tall), the extension cord came out of the unit about every other swipe. I tried switching extension cords, thinking that perhaps the connector on my cord was faulty. Apparently that wasn't the problem, though, because the second cord popped out even more than the first. Talk about annoying! Fortunately, my tots were out in the yard with me so it kept my frustration from becoming audibly offensive ;). However, I fully plan to take this unit back to Home Depot tomorrow because I can't deal with aggravation of having the cord fall out every 10 seconds (literally)."
4,b&d hedge trimmer,"amazon had the product I wanted, the order form was easy to fill out and the product was shipped and received in good shape...I will recommend amazon to others.."
3,Worked perfectly for about a year,"This was an inexpensive belt-clip watch that was exactly what I was looking for--for about a year. I had problems with the light working sporadically from the very beginning--pressing the button that is supposed to activate the light doesn't always turn the light on. But, I rarely needed the light, so that didn't bother me too much.After about a year of use, however, the watch started running slowly, almost not noticeable at first, and eventually losing as much as 20 minutes in a day. I thought the battery was going bad, so had it replaced, but even with a brand new battery, it is still losing about 15-20 minutes a day."
4,Pretty? Okay... yeah... Pretty,"If you can make me like the Commodores song ""Three times a lady""..ummm.....I guess you have my attention then.Although the vocals are a bit twangy and lack luster,the lyrics are so gripping and well,pretty.Members from the Promise Ring and Pele have song titles such as """"Arrest Harrison Ford"" and lines like ""I would be there,say the word. I'm a straight shooterlike Larry Bird."""
4,Mick Foley- hardcore legend and novelist,"I just finished Tietam Brown this evening, and it is the most compelling novel I have read in some time. While it can often be deeply disturbing, I found that I just couldn't stop reading until I found out how things would turn out for Andy. The narration is skewed enough to be very interesting, and the cultural references are fun to read. The characters really come to life, though some (ok, most) are twisted as heck. I recommend this book to Foley fans, as well as those not easily shocked. This ain't a book for your Grandma, but those who enter Tietam's world will not be disapointed.Also recommended:Foley is Good and Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsock are also by Foley and are highly recommeded. Those who like this book may also like John Irving titles such as A Widow for One Year and The World According to Garp."
5,this is by far the best book,This book not only shares the heart and sould that mick foley puts in his books but the heart and sould of a true author. I give a standing ovation to mick foley book and if this is his last one which i hope it is not he will end on top.
2,Gross!,"This is a good novel if, and only if, your most profound ideas of the real world have been formed by cartoons from Hustler magazine.It is, in a word, gross. Its subject is sex and violence, and not believably rendered, either. Plot development is piecemeal, character description is barely enough to form a consistent mental picture, and its themes are a series of clichés alternating with pop-schlock movie images and highly questionable pseudo-psychological insights, such as, if you let a big guy beat the crap out of you, it will make him cry. (I'm sure if the author could track me down, he'd make my head explode, pick my broken teeth out of the flesh of his knee, and end up completely covered with my blood...all except for the whites of his eyes.)On the other hand, from reading the other reviews here on Amazon it becomes clear that this is a novel written for male adolescents, and that they like it just fine. So who am I to say?"
1,THIS IS NOT THE NIGHT COURT SITCOM WITH HARRY ANDERSON,"If you are looking for the TV sitcom starring Harry Anderson, John Laroquette, et.al., this is not it. Here is the correct one:Night Court - The Complete First Season"
1,Nights Court USA Vloumes 1-6 (6-DVD),I'm so disappointed that those dvd doesn't have any Closed Caption or Subittled for the deaf and hard of hearing. Remember that over 25 millions of deaf and hard of hearing people live in this America!
1,Night Court USA 1-6 CDs,Wrong product ordered. I sent it back. The company did well and I would use them again. Product sent in timely maner.
5,"Amazing, ambitious, acidic","If you think Pink Floyd is psychedelic, for God sakes, check this out. This album makes them seem flat out LAZY. The Germans were creating some crazy messed up noise rock in the '70's, and these guys were near the top of the heap. One of THE MOST varied, schizophrenic sound journeys from that magical year for music (1971) - you can tell they worked hard on this one, and it is a technicolor nightmare of extreme proportions that still startles today. Really, it runs the gamut from acoustic to rock to imaginary sci-fi soundtrack sounding stuff. If yer looking for something calming, however, this is not it. A towering musical achievement."
5,A Brilliant Collection of Essays,"Gore was in rare form in the 80s, inspired by the Reagan Revolution and the rise of the Christian Right and their focus on Israel and the impending Armageddon.His essays collected here, mostly from the New York Review of Books and the London Times literary supplement, range from devastatingly funny looks at Nixon and the Reagans, the rise of armageddon cultural politics, as well as simply brilliant essays on writing, Calvino, Dawn Powell, Paul Bowles and others.Each one takes you immediately inside Vidal's head, and his voice becomes yours as you savor every witty and insightful observation. A national treasure."
2,Outdated When I Ordered,"Open Office is available with free download, but since I have dial up connection it kept timing out before download completed, so I decided to order the CDs.Was delivered in a timely manner and in good condition and cost effective. The only problem was that once installed, I was notified there was an update available. And the update was not a small incremental update - but required a full download - again a time out factor.Finally found a work around for downloading - so am now using Open Office and it is working well for me.Maybe I did not do enough searching to find the latest version - maybe there is a newer version out there now.Some of the problem may have been me selecting the wrong product."
2,Boring book,"I didn't like this book. Its written in fiction/novel form and I prefer Hollywood tell-alls that name names - real names. I honestly got bored not too many pages into this book. I couldn't finish it. This book may be more interesting to Hollywood insiders because so many of them can figure out who this author is talking about. I'm not from Hollywood, so I didn't know who he was talking about, if anyone.I would recommend other books over this one - ""Mr. S"" by George Jacobs (a book about Frank Sinatra and friends), and I plan to read the Eszterhas book ""Hollywood Animal,"" that just hit the book stores."
3,The Book is falling apart at the Seam. The pages are breaking loose from the spine!,I expected the book to be in better shape for the price I paid ! I was tempted to return it.
2,Banner waving,"This is a very deceptive book prefaced as though objective it is clearly a parade down main street for the contributing writers, proclaiming their theories to be right and all opposing theories to be wrong. I would have preferred more facts.The arguments made against archaeologists such as Gimbutas by others in this field with opposing views, work equally well when turned back upon the contributing authors of this book. A theory is a theory and speculation is speculation. Not being able to prove something makes the argument weaker and less impressive, yes, but it does not equate to error or fabrication. There is nothing in this book that disproves the theories of Gimbutas and others like her. The book merely presents opposing theories as fact and dismisses any contrary theory as fiction."
4,"Nice, but...","This is a nice unique product at large and certainly useful. But there are small things to improve, such as...1. Kleenex pul-out opening in the front doesn't work. When you pull the first piece of paper, the second one never comes out.2. The lid is rediculously big for the top opening. It's about twice as big as the opening. Why should it be so big?My wife likes it and it's hard to find elsewhere anyway."
4,Thule 7033 Litter bin,This automotive litter bin from Thule seems well-made and durable. My only complaint is the somewhat high price.
3,Dissapointed,"I originally bought it for my wife who rejected it, so I tried it and I ended up disappointed. It is a quality bag, but it always seems to be in the way when passengers get in the car or I need to put the rear seats down to haul larger cargo. I ended up putting it on the floor, which it was not designed to do and it is constantly falling over"
5,Great case for framing nailers,"Quality construction, good case. The only problem I have is that my Senco 752xp framing nailer will not fit in this case without the zipper being open a couple of inches. Still it provides good protection to the gun and stays around the gun. If you have a full round head framing nailer, you may want to check the dimensions. The bag dimensions given are for a flat bag and shrink when expanded to fit the nailer. (My nailer is smaller than the dimensions given, but still does not fit.)"
3,Not all thaaat big,"Might fit most guns, but wasn't quite big enough for my Makita AN922 Round Head Framing Nailer. Will try another brand, hopefully just a little bit bigger"
2,Gimme A Break Stanley...,I'm a big fan of Stanley Clark and I believe in telling it like it is. If you like watered down radio ready garbage then this is the cd for you. If you like something that really shows Stanley's talent don't waste your cash on this one. I'll be selling mine real soon.
2,Horrible!!!,"For me one of the best songs was 1 2 the BASS and Just Cruzin' the rest you can forget it!!! Stanley, my friend you are so talented, what did you do before recording this CD?"
4,"1, 2, is a different kind of Stanley CD","I never understand people who want an artist to do a record like one they did 20 years ago. Stanley could have made another fusion record and sold about 50 copies.""1, 2, To The Bass"" is a selection of tracks that reflect the diversity and range of Stanley Clarke, as he is TODAY!!!If you still live in the 70's, bell bottoms, velvet paintings and all, first you should check your calendar, and then you probably shouldn't get this record. But if you are a person who can embrace a diverse range of music that reflects the modern musical culture(and then some), plus some blazing bass licks, this is the disc is one should check out."
5,The master of the bass,"Stanley Clarke has shown his talent over and over again. He truly works the bass on 1,2 To The Bass. He tops it off with Just Cruzin. This tune encourage you to cruise with Stanley. The cut I Shall Not Be Moved inspires anyone who needs that one or two words to go on. Thank you Stanley for your excellent talent and for the music that provide inspiration to all."
3,"Nice try, but no cigar !","Stanley's latest effort after nearly a decade is pretty good but by no means great.We all know that he is capable of much better stuff. Yep, there is some influence of his movie scores here especially on the track Los Caballos (The Horses). The instrumental tracks probably work best on this album. A talented guitarist like Joe Satriani is wasted on the song 'HAIR'. There is no room for someone like Oprah Winfrey on an album of this nature. Her spoken words alone constitute 6 min+ !. The presence of jazz veterans like Hubert Laws, Paul Jackson jr, Vinnie Colaiuta, George Duke & saxophonist Everette Harp save this album to a large extent. Indian violinist L.Subramaniam adds some finesse to the tracks All the Children & Shanti. With support from all these jazz giants Stanley with some better writing could have transformed this into a much better album !"
3,Can do better,"Sorry Stanley, just not one of your better recordings. All I can say is that I hope this is not your last."
2,Stanley I've heard better,"All about the bass is great. Stanley is my favorite bass player and I was looking for a special CD. However, I did not get it this time. No matter, he is still my favorite bassist. Until next time."
3,resting on his laurels,"It would be difficult enough to compare with the incomparable body of work Stanley Clarke has done, but this is not the same as what we've come to expect.Maybe Stanley's been doing movie scores too long. I sadly concur with these other dissappointed reviewers."
2,Zaio Zone Owner,"Simple operation on this gps device with only 1 button. About the size of a small fliptop cell phone. Comes with a standard charger and a car charger (bonus star rating for that). I wish I could tell if its actually working while I score my zone. ***Warning***this device annoyingly shuts off every ten minutes. Having to constantly check if its on. I wanted to wear it around my neck but the space to slip a neckchain through is so small I haven't been able to find anything that fits. So, as I walk I have to carry it in my hand to see it is functioning. Lame."
3,Interesting...very interesting,"I bought this guy really ceap. I wanted a new Zoid, so I plucked this guy off the shelf. He isn't the greatest, but he is an interesting Zoid. His main feature is that he lights up. Not all Zoids light up. If you want a unique Zoid, try this guy out. He isn't the best as far as design goes, but if you want something to do, I suggest him. If you're a serious collector, I wouldn't bother with this Zoid."
4,Fun way to pass the time...,"Great little game to take to doctor's office while waiting, soccer practice or having nails done. Very pleased with purchase. Screen is large, easy to see."
5,Blackjack and Poker,"This Bicycle branded gaming pad arrived as described and very quickly! The first things that I noticed were the quality of the build, the quick response of the touch screen, and the fact that there was an extra stylus and batteries included.All in all, a really good deal at a great price!"
2,Hard to see,"Bought this for my elderly father who loves these games, but the cards and labels on this was too small for him to see and use. Directions were a little more involved than necessary"
1,Better books are available.,"The ""Colloquial"" series is very uneven in quality, and this is one of its poorer examples. It suffers the deficiencies of most Persian grammars available in English: too little of everything. Too little grammar, too little vocabulary, too few exercises, too little recorded on the cassette.For good Persian learning materials see ""Introduction to Persian"" by Wheeler Thackston, ""Persian Grammar"" by Ann Lambton, and ""Spoken Persian"" by Serge Obolensky."
2,This is really just a phrase book,"This is one of the only affordable cassette-book sets for learning Persian, so in that sense, it is worth buying. However, a lot of the taped portion is just what you might find in a phrase book. There aren't any dialogues in the book and the spoken passages sound extremely stilted. It is not of the same quality as the more recently produced books in the ""Colloquial Series""."
4,Great book for enhancement of learning,I have several books on persian. This book is great for helping someone put together words and everyday conversation. It would not be great as a first book but it is wonderful for someone with a little background of study who wants to learn to converse or just understand. I recommend this book highly as a supplement to study
3,Is this book Kheili Bouhali or Khaylie Buhahlie?,"Its hard to teach a language without a big fat text book, however Leila Moshiri does a great job in such little space. If only there was a kink or two made to make some obviouse questions answered, this is as good as a 'pocket sized' book on any language could get. Unfortunately the persian script is not used, which is not nessasarily needed but highly useful if traveling Iran. The main problem realtes to how inconsistant english transliteration can be. It needs to be pointed out that certain sounds in Farsi are concidered the same in England. Some sound in Farsi simply don't exist in english. Farsi is a comparably easy language to learn, best done with a good kick start, which Moshiri does fairly well. The dictionary in the back came to be very useful, though sometimes frustrating. Three Stars"
1,What?,"Although I gleaned one or two nuggets from this DVD... As a dancer and ballet teacher, I was offended by the flawed technique of the demonstration dancers. I was appalled by the exaggerated head positions, turn-out, arms, etc. I was bothered by the tense shoulders which should be relaxed and held so the neck is long and the body line is uninterrupted. At the very least, an instructor should have been present to correct the problems and explain to the viewer the correct way to execute these exercises. I would not recommend this DVD series to my students or anyone wishing to learn proper classical ballet technique."
4,Perfectly met my expectation,The contents in this visual dictionary are no doubt extremely practical and useful for an adult Ballerina like me. The narrator's voice is soothing and the DVD menu is clear and straight-forward. It serves as great reference tool when I have any doubt of executing certain moves properly.
5,Great Instructional DVD,As a teacher it is a welcome to have such an outstanding visual display of correct ballet technique. I highly recommend this product
4,Magic Muscle - 'Gulp!' (Woronzow),"Basically, just good all around festival-like psychedelic / space rock. Looks to be their fifth of six lp's they've put out between 1971-1999. 'Gulp!' is their 1991 release. Features some noisy voice-over effects in the beginning of this seven track CD. Tunes that made me realize how much this disc is able to put you in a good mood are ""Hailer Of Taxis"", the awesomely performed twelve-minute ""Spaced And Displaced"" (great violin work), the sedate ""Pipecall"", the Spiral Realms-like two-minute ""Psymonic"" and the other twelve-minute epic ""Leaders"". Notice the Hawkwind connection in this band's line-up: Rod Goodway-guitar & vocals, Nick Saloman-guitar, Simon House-violin, Adrian Shaw-bass and Steve Broughton-drums. A definite should-have."
4,Bevis & Goodway Crank It Up,"Recorded in 1991 this Woronzow super band was made up of Steve Broughton on drums, Simon House - violin, Adrian Shaw - bass and the twin lead guitar frenzy of Rod Goodway and Bevis Frond himself. Heavy psychedelic rock for any acid head or one who appreciates good psych music."
2,Lukewarm Survey of Near Death Experience Literature,"Just once I'd like to find a book on near death experiences written recently that doesn't simply summarize the same classic books on the subject. If you aren't familiar with the literature of the area, this book might be moderately helpful.In the true classic supermarket book tradition, this book has the feeling of a semi-scholarly survey which was given to an editor who then added a plethora! of! exclamation! points! and unrelated bits about Christ being an alien. In other words, pretty much a mess."
1,disappointed,I just received my Porter-Cable Robotoolz RT-3620-2K Rotating Laser System. The rotating laser visibly wobbles. I am in the process of investigating the return policy right now.
4,Good enough,"I have had no issues with this product. For the money, it has been a great deal. I would have liked to have purchased an auto leveling product but I couldn't justify the additional cost. Based on what was available at the time, this was the best bang for the buck."
2,Yes Its Venezuelan but not the recent one.,"This one has 7 stars, while as of now, the venezuelan flag has 8 stars.How do I know ? I'm Venezuelan, and the stars represent the provinces that signed the independence treaty.By it missing one, it cannot be considered representative of its true meaning."
3,Good history of the breed--lots of nice photos,The first part of the book gives a very detailed and entertaining history of the Jack Russell Terrier. The development of the breed around the world is then covered and gives the reader an appreciation of how the breed got to its current state. The last part of the book gets into some rather technical aspects of breeding.The book doesn't cover working the dog. It is very confomation and kennel club oriented.
4,Handy device with the easiest set-up ever,"I own a MacBook AIR which does not have a ethernet port (only WIFI), however from time to time I find myself in a situation where I can only connect to the Internet using ethernet. The Linksys G1000 solves this problem neatly, it is small, works right out of the box and offers good performance (although not gigabit speeds since USB 2.0 tops out at 480mbit).In short a wonderful little device that solves my networking problems in both Windows, OS X and Linux. The only reason why I do not give it five stars is because of its ridiculous design and lack of a build in USB port (the ability to act as a USB hub would have been very nice)."
1,Poor design--chews branches off,"I am a retired quality control manager and impatient with tools that don't work. I returned this hedge trimmer after using it one half hour to cut tender new growth less than 1/8 inch diameter. As you sweep the trimmer bar across the hedge, the branches bend while the blade chews away at them. Many looked like they were torn off. It's bad for the hedge and hard work as you have to go back over and over the same place.I gritted my teeth and bought a Little Wonder 19 inch elecric hedge trimmer that cost three times as much, but it is a joy to use--the branches fall away, cut cleanly."
1,HS 1010 Hedge Hog,"I agree with two out of three of the other reviews. The Hedge hog runs smooth, but does not cut small growth. It just smashes them, and leaves the stem hanging on the bush. This is probably due to the very short (1/8"") cutting blades. I don't like to be negative, but just wanted to alert others to this problem. I bought a Black&Decker HT-2000 with the old fashioned large blades, and it works great."
1,It chews the branches off!!,"I have to agree with the other ratings for the Hedge Hog, it does chew the branches off of the bushes. The main reson I purchased it is to get the thicker branches that my old trimmer will not cut."
2,Should have paid attention to reviews before purchasing!,Cuts (really doesn't cut) rather chews off the shrubs and leaves a brown stem sticking out of what has been cut. They have a engineering problem with this tool. Contacted B & D by Email but received no response.
1,Doesn't hold up.,"We've had a B/D Hedge Hog 20 for about a year. It went in the trash today. It worked OK when new, but after just perhaps 15 hours of fairly gentle use over the past year, it has become close to useless. The drive mechanism jams easily, it has difficulty cutting more than a few small twigs at the same time, and the blade support bent. Don't waste your money on one of these poorly made tools."
1,Not what I ordered,"I did not get what I ordered. The picture and description on this product is for Q-Tips.What I got was a box of ""Made in China"" dynarex cotton tipped applicators.I have sent two requests to the company for them to rectify the problem. As of this date, I have not heard from them.If you are expecting the brand Q-Tips, go somewhere else to make your purchase.Very disappointed."
5,Black & Decker TR1400 14-Inch Hedge Trimmer,This product was just perfect for the small jobs I have to do. Cut through my hedges like butter.*UPDATE*Just thought I'd mention that this little trimmer is still going strong in 2012 (5 years later).
5,Very nice product,"Works great for me. Have used it only once since I brought, but was lightweight and easy to handle even for a beginner like me."
3,Watch Out For This One,"DF DUB...what can I possibly say about them? How about this...Their album ""Country Girl"" is good but I was dissapointed to find out that this cd is edited not explicit. You cannot find this cd unedited anywhere. It takes away from the fullness of this album. As to why they don't have one that is explicit-is beyond me.All I can say about their album is, it gets 3 stars and that is pushing it to the max."
1,Does not cover the important new features,"I bought the book, based on previous positive critics here (Amazon). The implication was that this book covers the new features of SQL Server 2005. Well, the first one that I was looking for, the PIVOT (crosstab) is not even mentioned, let alone covered even briefly. I did not search all the new features, but if you want a book that cover both old and new features, this one is certainly NOT the one that you should look for.The publisher rep tried to tell me that no one book could cover all subjects. This is true, but for a book that specialize in T-SQL and T-SQL only, the features should have been covered, or, at least mentioned briefly.I've found books that cover the new features only, or the old features only. The quest is not over for me, yet.ZA"
1,For Insomniacs And Zombies Only.,"Poor Leslie Nielson. After making a couple of funny movies with the Zucker Bros (NAKED GUN series, AIRPLANE) he is now stuck with low grade spoofs. SPY HARD, DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, WRONGFULLY ACCUSED and now this, which is worse than any of the aforementioned. I won't bother going into detail because this is just not funny. In fact, its downright boring. Arthur C Clarke should sue the makers of this movie for playing on the title of 2001. If you're already dead from the neck up you may find something of merit in this movie, if not don't waste your time."
4,lighten up and laugh,"All these people giving 1 or 2 star ratings must have been trying to enjoy the Wall Street Journal while the movie was playing. Come on it is a Leslie Nielsen movie! The humor is simplistic and usually stupid. It is not meant to be intelligent, it is meant to appeal to the simplest of minds. In order to enjoy it you have got just lighten up and laugh!"
3,Only for Leslie Neilson die hards,"Okay, this wasn't the greatest movie in the world. This movie did have some usual Leslie Neilson laughs in the screwball comedy-style tradition. For instance, Neilson goes into someone's room as a spy trying to be as quiet and careful as can be, and, as usual, winds up leaving the place a disaster area. If you aren't a die hard Leslie Neilson fan, then this might be a movie to pass on. However, this movie is funny in certain respects. I give this a movie a 3 stars. I felt like the plot was, as often in these comedies, as thin as a piece of paper. This movie was about 90 minutes and really could have been done in about 60. The ending scene tended to drag a little and didn't produce as much humor as I would have hoped. This is the kind of movie that is probably funnier to think about later after viewing than when actaully seeing it. That being said, I still think it is a funny movie."
5,Laugh All Night Long,"Though some Leslie Nielsen can be a little over the top, he is better than some of these younger comedians that still have not mastered stupid comedy. My wife and I loved it and my Mom and Dad will laugh their butts off. I highly recommend this movie especially if you need a good laugh without using to much brain."
2,Eh...,"i'm not sure exactly what has been happening to leslie neilsen lately. it's hard to imagine that his taste has become so poor, but it's even harder to imagine he made a movie like this for the 'art.' the comedy here is juvenile even for one of his movies. everything just sort of seems flopped together without any real concern for making a coherent parody. the acting is poor as well. bombs like this make me long for the days of 'the naked gun' or even 'spy hard' for that matter. hopefully he'll get out of this rut and give us something better the next time around."
1,Lame,I saw this on Comedy Central expecting Leslie Nielsen to be funny. He wasn't. Really weak writing!!!
3,About Average...,"Space Travesty is a parody of several Sci Fi films, such as Fifth Element and Star Wars among others.Though not a masterpiece (not even an average funny movie), it will provide for a few laughs. The casting is not bad, with Leslie Nielsen being his usual self, though not as good as we're used to seeing him. Average plot, average acting, below average humor (!!!), but the leading actresses are simply AMAZING!!! WOW...Overall, it is a movie worth watching only for the FANTASTICALLY GORGEOUS Ophelie Winter and Alexandra Kamp-Groeneveld who are unbelievable! I would have given the movie two stars, maybe even one, were it not for these two."
5,2001 A Space Travesty,"I first saw this Movie in Moscow Russia on a Cable Channel at the Hotel that I was staying in in 2005.I only caught the last 30 minutes of it.but I laughed the whole 30 minutes.I tried to locate this movie many time,until recently when I logged on to Leslie Nielsons Web Site,and found this movie.I found it as funny today,as I did in 2005.Anthony A Smelgus"
1,What's that smell?,I don't know how an actor with so many good movies under his belt can get caught up in a movie this bad.
1,"Don't waste your time, why did Leslie waste his?","Let me start by saying I love Leslie Neilson movies, the Naked Gun movies are great. But this film is bad. The scenes are just not funny, they go on and on, I ended up fast forwarding hoping it got better, IT DIDN'T!Many scenes are stolen from other great comedies, but are just butchered in this, into un-funny waste of time. Scenes go on and on, but I will not in this review.If you have not seen this film and are considering it due to your love of Leslie Neilson's other work, DON'T!!"
2,TMI...(too much information)...!,"I've just returned from a week in Hong Kong, and, halfway thru my stay, chucked this book in the dustbin. It appears it tried to cover everything, and, in doing so, in effect, covered nothing. I found Fodor's guide to be much superior, in locating what might be of interest to me. Oh, by the way, ""do"" go to Hong Kong, it was the most eye-opening trip I've made in 35 years. But...leave this book at home!"
2,It's a start,"Welcome to Littleton.That is it. You get a thumbnail of the town of Littleton, a couple of antagonistic neighbors and npc's and one incredibly hard dungeon that leaves you with nothing to show for it even if you survive.It is a place to start and build from and thats about it."
5,What a debut!,"Well, everyone's mileage may vary, but for me this is the best audiobook I've heard in a very long time. It's hard to describe without giving away the plot, but this is a dark, weird, Matrix-like story that starts out one way and winds up somewhere completely different, and along the way it amuses, provokes, tickles and disturbs. It takes a little while to realize where it's going, but once it comes together, look out. I had chills by the end of it. For a first novel, Idlewild is terrific, and honestly for a fifteenth novel it'd be pretty darn good too.Four and a half stars, and I'm rounding that up to five."
1,empty,"I couldn't get past the immaturity of the writing and the main character, Halloween. So page 50 was it for me."
1,"Just an Outline, Not a Book","Idlewild seemed more like an outline of a potentially good book, than a real book. The story lacked depth, character development and description. Perhaps N. Sagan will expand it some time into something more meaty. Or maybe I was spoiled by just finishing the 4 book Otherland series by Tad Williams."
1,"Incongruent, Illogical Sci-Fi, with monotonous and S'Hollow'","I feel so used, my time and money wasted in having spent my thoughts in pondering out this juvenilelistic, unsensible imagination, no, it can't even called an imagination of this so called writing? I have to admit that I had to stop reading and drop this plain jane of a story, almost near the end, when Hollow-een and his companion went 'shopping'? In the midst of an armageddon, the shopping malls remained unlocked? And, who buried the last of the dead bodies? The simplicity of virtual within virtualness is so weak. This story is like a cheap sci-fi movie, no, I take that back. I cannot credit this story to any of those 'classics'! And, what's with the author stuck on ALL of his characters saying the same and exact curse word. I tried hard to finish the book so that I may just put in my criticism with credibility, but, I had to move on to another novel!"
4,Savvy and quick near-future thriller.,"It does not surprise me at all to read that Nick Sagan has been working in Hollywood on screenplays. The way that Idlewild is structured has quite a bit in common with some of the better thriller films out there.The story of Halloween and his friends in their virtual school is inventive, fast-paced and occasionally moving. The characters are believably written, and the dialogue snappy. The great good-natured fun of it all allowed me to forgive a few of the more obvious plot holes that might have otherwise distracted from the ride.Do not expect something at the level of the more complex cyberpunk writers like Gibson or Sterling. Think instead about virtual worlds + teenage angst + the possible end of mankind. You get the idea.An entertaining book and a good use of some spare time."
4,The best book I've read in the past few months,"Sagan's first novel surprised me in that I rather expected it to be fantasy, based on the cover. The first part of the book carried me along in that notion, but then I discovered it was so much more.This is by no means a polished work, but it is very very good for a first novel. I've read a lot of sf, and this still managed to surprise me (plotwise). Which was refreshing.It might not be knock your socks off good, but it's definitely worth reading. I'll be nominating Sagan for the Campbell award (best new SF Author) this year."
4,good debut,"overall i enjoyed the book but i have to say the second half of the book was dramatically better than the first. i found it very hard to get into the book but the reveal worked for me. i'm not sure if i feel the need to follow thru on the trilogy, but the book itself stands alone quite nicely."
1,Picture does not fit desciption,This picture is for the Xenon FF200 which is not consistent with the description
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET A PRESS RELEASE!!!,"I am a HUGE Donna Karan fan and could not wait for this book to be releases, but I was extremely disappointed when I recieved it. The first few pages are an interview with Karan. Every question asked is answered in her press release and is talked about in just about every magazine article ever written about her. The other 65 or 70 pages are old pictures of her clothes. Most of the pictures are old ads and if you follow her collections, you have already seen them. My advise is to call Patti Cohen's office and ask for a press release or to start reading magazine articles about Karan. It is a lot less expensive and is more informative."
4,"An ""OK"" kids cookbook","I bought the cookbook mainly for myself ( I am Emeril fan), wanting to use it with my daughter when she wanted to be in the kitchen with me. The recipes are really just his ""regular stuff"", meaning he didn't change anything to make them more desirable for children except for the names of the recipes (ie: Baby Bam Burgers, Little Mean Turkey Loaf, Broccoli with Seriously Cheesy Sauce, etc.) Only the names make them more desirable to children. Real pictures of the food are not included - they are simply colorful drawings that look real nice. My 7-year-old prefers real pictures of the food so she knows what she's going to be eating - so do I. In all, I like the book for myself to add to my Emeril collection, but my daughter has other kid's cookbook's that she prefers over this one. It's an ""OK"" kids cookbook. It was a nice attempt at a kids cookbook (the recipes ARE good) but I would reccommend going to the library and borrowing the book before deciding to buy it."
1,BAD,The recipes were not very good and the book was very annoying. When I made the mac&cheese it referred me to the Bam seasoning. It's basically this mix that uses every spice and you don't even end up using most of it so i just threw it out. The book gave me a headache reading it and nothing rly tasted that good
4,Good learning tool for kids,The safety instructions are great. The utensil glossary gives a great reference for our kids. The recipes are a little spicy for our kids but they enjoy experimenting.
4,non-fiction based fiction,"I love when authors write novels based on real events. It mixes reality with fantasy in a way that leaves you questioning if there's a difference between the two. McEnroe's first novel is a brave and successful attempt to convey one man's experience of the tragic events of the Persian Gulf war. Not a soldier's perspective, not even a draft dodger or a family member of a soldier. Just a guy going through his ""normal"" life and work experiences but with the Gulf War as the backdrop. The war actually became a character for me. The other minor characters were very real to me too, and I followed the main character's interactions with Jake (his friend), Georgia and Felix (his neighbors) Lawrence and the other kids at the homeless shelter with as much interest as I did the main story. Read it and see for yourself! Can't wait for his next novel."
1,"Cheaply made, leaked right away.","I carefully sealed the battery compartment, following the instructions. I have other underwater devices with similar O rings and have not had a problem with them leaking. This unit leaked at 10 feet and was not there when I needed it."
2,"Not reliable, waste of my money","My piece broke down without a reason for only few time use. The sound became very low or sometimes no sound at all even w/ fresh batteries. Batteries ran out fast too so I don't bother getting it repaired by warranty. Instead I purchased a new alert device operated by BCD inflater, which is much more reliable and no further cost of batteries."
2,refarding the info,"Being agree with the previous review, I do not find the explanation of this title much of help. I am looking for digital format of the Be Series. Having audio dos not tell me that if there is any text in digital format or it is just reading. Does any one know of digital forms of Wiersby's books?"
4,great,"I like the product, so I buy it that's all there is to that.nothing more to say really.I like the product, so I buy it that's all there is to that.nothing more to say really."
1,Don't !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"American Health Products - Apple Cider Vinegar, 600 mg, 200 tabletsSave your money. My order has not shipped after 3 weeks. Choose another vendor. Especially if you really want this product soon"
3,still watching results,"I am still new to this product and watching resultys, but I will say it has a Wow factor when you open the bottle, the vinegar smell is strong and goes right into the sinus's.. strong stuff."
4,Great alternative to liquid ACV,"Hi. My girlfriend has introduced me to the benefits of ACV, but I couldn't get past having to drink the stuff every day. So I looked into solid form ACV.This product as made it possible for me to get my daily intake of ACV without the nasty taste. The pill still smells very strong (it's not coated) but at least I'm not drinking it. It just goes down easily with a glass of water.I recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to drink the stuff. It's like a million times easier.I would give this a 5-star rating if the pill was coated so it doesn't smell.Good luck!"
5,Apple Cider Tablets,This is a great product if you can't get the taste of vinegar out of your mouth. I ordered this product and I receieved it faster than the approximate shipping time. Be prepared when you open the factory seal under the cap. The cap act as a dispenser for the tablets. Once the seal is removed from under the cap you will get the WOW factor from the vinegar smell!!! The tablets dissolve quickly to give you the benefits of the apple cider vinegar.
5,"Fast Shipping, Excellent Quality",The shipment was received within less than two weeks and the books condition was excellent. There were no problems encountered with this order. Seller is top notch.
1,hyper-allergenic,"My wife tried it for a few times--being the trooper she is--but she could not get used to the burning sensation around the eyes. If the serum had actually worked, I would have given it more than 1 star."
2,Raccoon Eyes,"I purchased Burt's Bees Repair Serum as a daytime under eye moisturizer. Unfortunately, it did a much better job of removing my mascara. I looked like a raccoon by the end of the day until I figured out it was Burt. It is ok as a night moisturizer."
3,Watch ut eyes,"I purchased this product because Burt's products are usually great. I'm not saying it's not great for around the eyes, just don't get it in them. It burns the inside of the eye because if your not super careful when you put it around the eye, it's a serum and can run into the eye."
5,Got this for one reason-SLEEP,"I have always had a difficult time sleeping. My tiny cranium just won't stop when I close my eyes. I had used a product on and off that worked but couldn't find it anywhere. So my hunt began. After much reseaching I bought three products-Badgers, Lavender spritz and Burts Bees'. All of these have many of the same properties. By far Burts Bee Repair Serum is the definite winner.I put it around my eyes, on my lips and on my temples before I go to sleep. I don't even remember falling to sleep and since I have been using this , not once have I gotten up in the middle of the night.For a Repair Serum, too early to tell but I didn't purchase this for that reason. Well worth the money."
2,Not sure if I like it,"When I read the word serum I though it could be pretty light and smooth like other serums but this ones is oily, heavier and I smells funny I do not really feel comfortable smelling it for awhile after I apply it, I got it because I read good reviews and now I hope it works."
3,"Not bad, not great","I've become a huge fan of using oil to moisturize, so I was excited to try this. As an undereye moisturizer, I find that it travels too easily and makes my eyes water. My eye area isn't super dry, though, so it just doesn't soak in very well. Because of this, it did nothing to smooth my skin or make it feel more hydrated.Instead, I use it all over my face (alternating nights with a retinol/night cream combo). It works fine, but no better than pure jojoba oil. Again, this ""serum"" for some reason just doesn't easily sink into my skin -- whereas my face absorbs jojoba oil so well that I can even use it in the morning and not feel greasy during the day.I'm disappointed -- I was really eager to try this, but it seems that I should just stick with what works."
5,GREAT SERUM,"This serum is a great mosterizer I use it along with Face Lift at your finger tips(the massage for your face that is in the book).If I bought the ingrediance individually it would be very expensive, so it is a great deal for the money.I stretch mine by adding other oil to it,olive or vitamine e.This has made my skin soooo soft,but not everything is for everyone."
1,Smell doesn't go away,"This could be a good product, but the smell doesn't go away, it sticks around, yuck! Try REN Omega 3 serum, it has all the good oils, but doesn't stink."
2,Not for me,"I bought this because of the positive reviews & the natural ingredient; however, it's too sticky even i used only tiny for my entire face. I tried it only twice in two consecutive nights, and I still can't stand the sticky feeling on my face. So I returned it next day. I have been using many different kinds of serum (fr dept stores / drug stores), i think the royal jolly makes it sticky or too rich for me. it may be a great product if the weight is not that heavy. BB becomes my favor since I want to use natural product to my skins."
1,Not so great,"Thanks to this serum I developed Cholinergic urticaria, a sensitivity to heat that causes extreme itchiness. Use very sparingly at your own risk, or not at all. I wouldn't recommend it. For all the trouble it's caused me, it didn't repair anything at all! It's a fine moisturizer, but there is much better available."
4,Good product and good price,"good products, it make skin better.and the price is good because we only use a small amount of the products. so it last long enough.I hope the producer look at the complains and trying to solve the problems.other than that it is a good products.hopefully they also look at other products critics and improve itgood luck"
2,Basically Just Oil,"This was basically just oil-which is fine if that's what you're looking for. It was useless to me and I don't really understand how oil could be useful for anyone. I returned this item. The smell is not bad, but it's very strong."
5,Very good oil,"I'm 39 and I've tried a LOT of different brands of skin care products.My skin type is combined ( dry and oily) and very sensitive to anything.I've been using this with facial cream ( mixing together) before bed for a month, and the result is incredible.All the pimples, white heads and flaky dead skins are gone and my skin is smoothest and healthiest in my life.I only wish if I'd known it earlier!"
5,Only thing that soothes my eczema,"Burt's Bees Repair Serum, 1-Ounce BottleAfter spending a lot of money on over-hyped products, Burt's Bees Repair Serum had been the only thing that soothes the eczema around my eyes, mouth and neck. I get terrible bouts of eczema during allergy season and this product has been the only thing that doesn't sting my skin - and - makes it feel better. It relieves itching and burning upon contact. After allergy season is over and my eczema subsides, I'll use it in the winter as a dry skin cure. A bottle lasts forever and it isn't easy to find in New York. I really like the smell and don't find it strong at all - as others have mentioned. I always have some around and wouldn't be without it."
3,Not Fabulous,This product is just not what I'm used to in terms of under eye treatment. It's basically a mix of essential oils and is just that- oil. It feels oily and weird under the eyes and on the eye lids. It's also WAY to fragrant. I have not noticed any benefit after using it for over 6 months. Still searching for that fabulous eye cream...
2,HipHop Samurai,"...I prefer traditional samurai movies with asian characters and a bit of sorcery if needed...Afro Samurai has Cell phones, RPG's and Robots?!..No thxs!...Afro also has a very annoying sidekick that reminds me of the donkey from the Shrek movies, so annoying!!! ...its to bad cuz they have a lot of unique characters that i like but..."
3,Not bad,"I watched this on Spike. It's ok, not great but ok.My biggest beef, why no Japanese language option? Sorry, but dubbed anime sucks."
3,i wish they left Samuel L Jackson out of this,He's there for comic relief and his character really detracts from the dark/serious tone of the story/animation.
4,Sweet movie...crappy case,"AFRO Samurai is an excellent movie. Very nice artwork in the show and is funny as the Bundocks! 5 stars for the movie itself the only gripe I had is the crappy case. Ok, the case is nice looking but its a pain in the butt trying to get the dvds out and in with out scratching them."
2,This series lacks substance.,"I am so surprised that most of you people loved this series, really i was hoping that i wouldn't be the one to point how banal, trite and meaningless this story is, it stops nothing short of visual rape, they waste all this time and money to do a over done, insult of a hip-hop Kenshi. i won't get into stereo types cause that will not change how susceptible people's mind are to brainwash, how can you call this type of over done none sense, teriffic, great, entertaining, dam! this is so sad, anyhow the biggest tragedy is that a role models like S.L.Jackson was part of this, laterz folks."
4,"A Day Late, But Overrall...","I'm a patient person, so the fact that this came a day late doesn't mean much, since the product itself made up for it. BIGTIME.The good:The packaging is fantastic; I love the artwork on it. The discs came in perfect condition, and both the featurettes and the film are awesome and top-notch, with an interesting featurette about the background which shares some interesting facts of the events leading up to how it was made, and the relationships between the actors and creators. The movie itself is just as enjoyable as I remember--more so. The animation is at its best at High School of the Dead-quality animation (another good show to check out). The fight scenes are fun to watch and it's never a dull moment.The bad:Like I said, a day late. But still, not much of a problem. One OTHER minor complaint I have is that I wished they took out the credits between episodes so that it played like a movie.But other than that, this still earns four stars, because it's AWESOME."
3,afro samuri,"is really amusing how this dude goes he is negor who uses asian sword desinged by asina ya right , but he goes throught life cutting up every boyd and his friend tags along and its really funny such fantasy . if it wasnt so dumb it wouldnt be so funny but you bette rhave an IQ above 150 to see how funny it is other wise you think is a true thing"
2,well drawn but craptastic,"I love Gonzo digitmation art, and maybe 10 years ago around the time of the original Ninja Scroll this level of plot and character development worked... but today this shines as a great example of US and Japanese co-development going badly. This series is like a long bad stereotype of all the violence, sex and gore negatively associated with anime and weak storyline, lack of character development and flat characters anime fans often dislike about western animation. The shame is a great studio really did well on artwork for a story that doesn't deserve the effort.the stars are for the spectacular art for a completely awful story"
3,A Textbook Example of Style Over Substance,"When I first heard about Afro Samurai, the $1 million-per-episode price tag is what hooked me. In a sea of cheap looking anime, the show's budget is mind-boggling--and it shows. You only see animation this good in movies. Couple that with the unique blend of hip hop and soul elements with a samurai revenge story, and you get a visual experience that's as fresh as it's first rate. That's all the more evident in HD.But that's where it loses those 2 stars.While the animation is amazing, nothing else stands out. The story is a shallow excuse for gore and titillation; the dialouge is cringe inducing; Justice is the only unique and/or likeable character (ironically enough). The story has no legs on its own; had it gotten a more reasonable animation budget, I would've left after the first episode.In the end, all I got out of it was the wish they'd put the resources elsewhere."
5,Anime Is Fun,Samuel L Jackson seemed like a odd choice for this. However once I started it I was hooked. Very interesting show.
3,"""Tarantino style"" - WTF","What I dont like the most..That this animation is somehow described as 'Tarantino Style'.How does this differ from any of the well established Anime or Manga creations that have graced our screens for the last 38 years.It aggravates me, that this has turned a full circle.That somehow, Tarantino's steal from this genre, has redefined itself as 'Tarantino style'.This is Anime as we know it... and quite frankly it doesnt come close to some of the brilliant original films it has ripped off..."
3,"Fun anime, looks great a Villian called the Afro Droid, what more do you want","This is a short series that anyone who likes action oriented anime can enjoy. It's neither the deepest nor the most rewarding show, but it's good for one hell of a ride. I find it odd that people are comparing it to series like Samurai Champaloo (even the editorial review comparing the climax to that of Cowboy Bebop). I mean c'mon that's just silly. Apples and oranges folks, those 2 shows were bench marks in the genre, and this is just a very entertaining footnote. Now I am first to cry foul when I hear American voices in anime (I mean I find American dubs just unwatchable), and at times this one is indeed tough to take. But Sam Jackson does a bang up job so I forgive the rest of the voice acting, and all the swearing helps one ignore the typical American wooden voice acting of the supporting cast."
5,Best Anime since Voltron,"It's a real shame that Samuel L. Jackson is promoted so heavily yet contributes so little to the plot of this terrific Anime. There are a few Japanese Animes that I like (Voltron, Robotech and the Ronin Warriors) but this one reigns supreme. I loved the more adult content and the ""Kill Bill"" like story line. Definitly pick this up if you liked the O'Ren part of Kill Bill Vol. 1. Coincidentally, the RZA also created the music for this series as well. Definitly worth the price."
3,"Visually nice, but cliche","Good to look at, but cliche.....isn't that what most anime is nowadays? I really don't understand why this stigma has to be attached to EVERY black character in anime.....the hip-hop thumping, blunt-smoking, brooding ladies man. Sure, it sounds nice, but isn't there alot more to our character? Frankly, it's wearing thin, and I see racism growing because of it, People seem to be forgetting all the contributions we have made!"
1,No returns,"Galaxy does not allow returns for mistakes made on the ordering form. Given how easy it is to make mistakes during the ordering process, this is unacceptable."
1,Made for gringos,"Barreto's image of Rio is false. There are no views of any slums and it's a fairy tale. Mary Ann's apartments has the shortest wall. What the hell is that about? In the real Rio the wall would be high and the security would be better. This false Rio is made to attract non Brazilians. The story is dull and rese,ble that of any Hollywood story. A waste of great actors. For a better Barreto fil check out ""Four Days In September"""
4,Bossa Nova,"This is a delightful film set in a magnificently beautiful Rio. Add the beat of the Samba, love, and wonderful characters and you have an experience that just makes you feel good. It is the kind of movie you can watch over and over."
3,It's okay in a way...,"I don't know how many people are familiar with this game. I feel like I have known it all my life, but cannot attest to ever playing an arcade. The graphics are nice and decent as is the music. The game play is kind of redundant is filled with nothing more then surprises. I do not know if the game can be beat (Beatable). After 15 minutes I usually find something else to play. It is a nice addition to a collection, but I prefer to play the Famicom version better, it's feels different then the Atari Port.-Thanks"
2,Tabs Fall Off,The holes punched are supposed to leave an extruded tab that remains attached on one side. Over 50% of the holes punched completely punched a hole where the entire tab fell off leaving nothing but a hole.
3,Could be better.,"I have had this phone for about a year and some change now. I am on my Second device. And this one has already giving me a list of issues.Pros:Great internet and messaging serivceSpeaker phoneHuge address bookQwery KeyboardCons:Belt weightKeys are glued onCan't send Net messages while in phone call. Causes over load occasionally. (will reset on you)No Alarm. To do list and calandar only beep, once.Made me not want a SKIII"
1,LCD breaks easily,"I am waiting for the 3rd sidekick II device. Both of the previous devices had their LCD break internally (with grey spots covering the screen), and make the phone unusable. The phone did not drop - it just happens out of the blue. If it wasn't for the fact that I am already past the 30day trial I would switch to another device (and carrier for that matter)Other than that the device is really cool - but that's not enough - reliability should come first."
2,Pay for Hardware Insurance!,"I use these for my business. I've had 3 sidekicks replaced in just under 8 weeks. The spring went bad on the first, the speaker and camera didn't work on the second, and the screen completely died on the third.We are not rough with these phones, but the design may have some fundamental flaws. I love the potential of these phones, but so far, my experience with them has been very frustrating.Do yourself a favor and pay for the extra insurance coverage if you decide to get one."
1,Sidekick is too cool. T-Mobile stinks,"As you will note from the other reviews, T-Mobile is awful. And in all liklihood no one there is smart enough or cares enough to read reviews of their service. Don't even try to make a call from a basement. Signal strength is non-existent. We called to cancel and they said, ""We'll give you the web server free for a month to try."" We cancelled within the month and they charged us anyway. Nothing we could say would make them rescind the charge. How do they stay in business?"
1,Keep Your $$$$$,"I was pleased during the honeymoon phase...until the screen cracked while in my handbag. I called TMobile and they were more than happy to pay to have the phone sent to their repair shop shipping and handling on them. While at the UPS center, I learned that that branch mails back 3-5 handsets a day. The phone is too fragile and they know it. The TMobile warranty does cover the buttons and sound quality, but not the screen in the 1 year warranty. TMobile is the manufacturer and the service provider. When I got the phone back from their service facility untouched, all they can say is ""I'm sorry, I understand,"" but your only solution is to have bought insurance in the first 7-14 days or else its too late and you will have to buy another device full price. Insurance is as expensive for your phone as it is for you. My phone was less than 90 days old! TMobile sucks!"
3,lets get the facts correct,"ok im not a kid but as others say this was easier. first of all to those of you who say tmobile was the manufacturor of the phone you must be crazy tmobile is simply a phone service provider they do not and will never make phones the sidekick is made by danger. it looks nice mostly appeals to young people but isn't that great for business people. the screen res. is not good and pics come out looking nasty. it is easy to chat though and do email and the internet is pretty fast as well. they do have a keypad problem where the keys sometimes fall off, but as far as screens breaking on thier own by magic never heard of that you should deffinatley invest in insurence with this phone and any phone you purchase it is not any service providers fault if you break the phone own up to that and get some insurence or just buy a new one. overall it is a good investment for fun"
3,Not sure what to think.,I bought this phone yesterday and as I was downloading the expense application the phone turned off and wouldn't turn back on. I had to call T-mobile and have them fix it.
3,Great Features but Flaky Phone/Service,"The Sidekick II is a great phone and does a LOT of things well. E-mail, Yahoo and AOL chat, lots of game selection and many other handy features. However, the web browsing is exceedingly slow most of the time. Every now and then you will request a page and it will actually come up within 10-20 seconds. Most of the time however, web sites will take 2-3 minutes to load, if they load at all - regardless of signal strength. In other words do not rely on the web browsing, especially for time-critical tasks (like looking up flight info at the last minute). Also the phone just acts flaky sometimes - lock ups, unresponsiveness to button presses, weird states, etc. are all quite common. I also experience dropped calls and echoes quite often, though this could be due to T-Mobile's service and not necessarily the phone. In summary, great features but prepare to be frustrated at times."
1,T-Mobile gets hacked easily,"Only buy this phone if you would like your info, pictures and address book to be hacked into! T-mobile has been easily hacked into as you have seen on the news...Paris Hilton and Fred Durst. Stay away from this one until T-Mobile gets their act together."
2,not worth the trouble,"I purchased the phone at an amazingly low price with all of the rebates ([...])! It's definitely different from any other phone I've owned in the past. The swivel screan was my favorite feature however, in the first week of using the phone, the screan broke right off. I took it to T-Mobile and they replaced it. Another week later, the keyboard cracked. Then, the screan cracked. I always carried the phone in the leather case in my pocket or purse. I've never had a phone that fragile before. I was at T-Mobile about 3 times a week with problem after problem, from equipment malfunctions to service issues. After two-months of nothing but trouble, I paid the [...] cancellation fee (the amount I saved in rebates) and threw the phone out. It just wasn't worth the trouble."
3,Nice features but cant use them,"I ordered a Sidekick II in mid-December and received it on a Monday. That same Monday night, the screen broke even though I did not drop the phone and it was not exposed to water or extreme conditions. The screen gets blacked out and discolored and you cant see anything. I ordered a replacement which I got one week later and, sure enough, two weeks after that, the screen broke again. Same exact problem. Once again, the phone was not dropped or damaged in any way. I gave up and cancelled my service and returned the phone. Beware of glitches with this seemingly poorly made phone."
2,"a little too ""user friendly""","Although the Sidekick II is easy to use, with an ergonomic, compact qwerty keyboard, if you are at all technically savvy you will find this PDA phone much less versatile than many ""ordinary"" satellite/internet phones.Only a few ringtones can be stored, and they must be purchased from a limited choice offered by t-mobile. The camera takes good pictures but they cannot be used as a display background. Java is not available. You can send .wav and jpeg files to the phone via email but they cannot be saved. The display decor seems rather Barbie-dollish and juvenile.At first I was excited about the Sidekick II but after encountering its annoying limitations, I soon lost my enthusiasm. If you want to customize your phone at all, this is not the device for you."
4,"The truth about ""hacking""","Reviewers who downgrade the phone because of alleged problems with ""hacking"" need to pay more attention. The people who circulated Paris Hilton's contacts did NOT hack into the phone. They figured out how to get into her voice mail system, and spent months checking her voice mails. It's NOT the phone's fault, understand? It could happen with any phone -- AND probably with any carrier."
2,"Good Phone , Bad Coverage","The Sidekick II phone is amazing, it's like a mini laptop. The only problem is that you would get more service coverage with a walkie talkie than T-Mobile. If I'm in the middle of Hollywood or Los Angeles, my connections are still bad even in such a metro area. I have trouble havea conversation for more than 10 minutes cause it just gets so staticy and disconnects at random.If T-Mobile had good coverage it would be great, but they don't , so it sucks."
4,REBATE WARNING,"I absolutely love my Sidekick II. The wireless Outlook sync feature is nice.. no docking cradle or Bluetooth to mess with. The web browsing has proved very useful, just wished it supported Java.However, I do have a MAJOR issue with rebates from Amazon on cell phones. You will wait FOREVER, and will probably have to pursue getting your check. They waited the entire 8-10 weeks PLUS another week before supposedly mailing the check out 3 weeks ago, which I have not received. And now, I must wait 30 days before they will ""resend"" it if it was ever actually sent out in the first place. I wouldn't think this was a scam if it wasn't the second time this has happened with Amazon."
1,HUGE LAG TIME ON THE REBATE,"The Sidekick 2 itself is GREAT; you can read the other reviews on that. I just wanted to pass on info on the rebates. The second one I had for $200 back STILL has not arrived & this is over HALF A YEAR later. I've put in several calls, faxes, letters, etc. Ridiculous. Just a head's up; don't plan on getting your $ back any time soon & I'd highly recommend you buy your Sidekick somewhere else."
4,COOl,"cool.i really want i sidekick. i'm a teen. i think it's good becuz alot of teens like to go to internet, chat on aim, take pictures. and also talk on the phone. All of that for the price of 150-250.Cooli'm getting one in may."
3,Such Small Machine...So Much Money!,"I saw this cell-phone on a TV Show called Zoey 101, and I thought ""It would be so cool to have a phone like that. So when I saw the price, I was about to faint. But it should be worth it. Then reviews on Amazon stated that the keyboard would break easily and T-Moble would have to repair it again and again and again and so on. Luckly I didn't buy it.p.s. always read the reviews!!!"
2,Okay for teens. Thumbs way down for grown ups,Heavy & bulky. Very limited functionilities. Breakable. Slooooooooow web browser. Usless web browser. Rather expensive downloads. Bad reception. No-brainer applications. Awkward phone features. Useless camera. Useless flash.
1,Not even worth being called a phone,"This 'phone' is awful! Horrible blurry pictures, that you can't focus. The flash function is pointless, you still can't make out what your picture was of. Can only send pictures through email addresses. Can only receive pictures through a website. Internet is incredibally slow. 98% of the time turns itself off before finding the page. I can hardly hear out of the ear peice half the time."
1,SideKick II is garbage.,"Please anyone considering buying a sidekick II, think twice. It's good for data but real horrible for voice. I regret ever having it and just today, decided to smash it in half rather than putting up on ebay or selling it someone else. I don't want anyone to go through what I went through with this P.O.S. phone."
1,This phone makes me so angry sometimes,"First, let me start by saying that I love this phone. I love the email function, the aim, and I especially love the keyboard, BUT, I've had this phone for less then a year and I already had to replace it twice for the same problems. My keys on the keyboard constantly break. T mobile said it problaly breaks so often because I use the keys too much...umm, is it just me or does that sound stupid!??!?! What?! am I not suppose to use the keys?!? Then what's the point?!?! If I knew this was going to be an issue, I wouldn't have spent $300 on this phone. I would have bought the razor instead."
2,Ok phone for people who dont like having service,ok im not trying to sound negative or anything but the T-Mobile Sidekick II is not a good phone to have it hides the antenna and it has no service almost ever I have had my T-Mobile Sidekick for about a year and i have been satisfied with it for about a week seriously do not buy this
3,Problems with the Sidekick II keyboard,"What everybody says in praise of the functionality of the sidekick II is true, BUT...A significant number of sidekick2 devices suffer from a major (if admittedly stupid) manufacturing flaw in that the ""alt"" keys do not light up with the rest of the keyboard, making affected sidekick II devices much less useable in dark situations.This problem has been noted by numerous ""early adopters"" of this device, many of whom were users of the original color and black-and-white Sidekick devices and availed themselves of a special sidekick upgrade program offered by T-mobile.Unfortunately, while Danger (who produces the device) and T-Mobile representatives have acknowledged that there is a problem (...), they have so far made no indication whether, when, or how the situation will be rectified. One can only assume that they continue to sell devices which suffer from this flaw."
1,pros vs. cons,"pros:-having a PC & phone in 1 digital device.cons:-breaks easy-can not remove the battery(internal) to 'cold boot' the phonewhich basiclly means if the software ever hangs, good luck.-service is less then average due to a not so good internal antenna.-so many repair calls to T-Mobile, they have created a new dparetment - the,'Sidekick Customer Service' to handle the workload and still the phone wait is on average 1 hour, give or take 10 minutes.-T mobile store locations(brick & mortar) can not help when the phone breaks. They give you a chair to sit on while waiting on the phone to talk to the new Sidekick Customer Service department.btw: I am on my 3rd refurbished in less then 4 months :-(BIG headache"
3,Almost but not quite,"I really like the features and it's very easy to type on of course. I like the design, the interface, the whole concept.But using this as a phone is terrible.My calls are constantly dropped and I am always losing connection. 70% of the time I have to dial a number 3 or 4 times to get the call to go through.When I actually am in a call, the reception is bad. It doesn't matter if I am in a bathroom or the top of a 30 story building in the middle of downtown. I have to say ""Can you hear me now?"" so much you'd think I'm in a Verizon commercial.If the reception on this phone was actually good, then I would be keeping this phone. Instead I am going to have to sell it because it's really ticking me off."
3,Get Powder,"If you are starting a serious Creatine routine, this just isn't going to be enough. The product does what it says it does but if you're a power lifter, you will want to go with powder."
1,A Total Disapointment,"I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back."
2,Unreliable construction that quickly fails,"My first 856 Nomad practically disintegrated during the first trip. The replacement bag has begun the same process after two 11-hour trips on the interstate. The inside liner is cracking and rips are begining in the outer liner. I have been careful not to exceed the 100 lbs. limit or to overstuff it. In hard rain, the first bag did not resist water at all.The ease of use makes this an appealing product, but I have determined it would be better to pay more for a hard cover carrier. The material of this product is not suitable for highway driving, especially if it rains."
2,Worried,Big enough for 3 sets of golf clubs and it did help us out. Worried about quality as the stitching around the tiedowns was starting to break and everything inside got soaked from the rain we drove through. I think that Thule quality is sinking fast!
1,Big Disappointment,We took this bag with us up to Washington and after only one day of driving small tears started on the inside which caused our belongings to get wet when it rained during the drive. A very big disappointment. I recommend not buying.
4,It's hard to beat for the price,"This cargo carrier was perfect for me, as I don't need it often. It is well built, and did a great job hauling gear on our last trip.The only downside is that it isn't fully waterproof (it doesn't claim to be). If you go through a light rain, you'll be fine. However, if you spend hours in a downpour, everything will get soaked. I expected this to happen, so packed everything in plastic trash bags. I'd recommend doing the same if you use this bag.If I needed it more often, I'd probably look at getting either a hard box or a bag that is fully waterproof. However, for the casual user like me, this is a great cargo bag."
1,Not a Good Item,"Grizzy has some great people working for them. Their customer service was spot on.Unfortunately my review for this product is not good. I received the product well packaged and on time. Once I had it I placed it in my lathe and began working on a new turning.After a few minutes of lathe operation, the bearing began to smoke. A few more minutes later after shutting down and then trying again, the bearing failed.This item was junk.No way of knowing if this would happen again, or is a typical problem, as Grizzly offered my my money back on this item.Wish, I had a #1MT Live centre though...."
3,"Made in China, not bad for an import.","Very food quality for an import. Don't know if it can take abuse like the USA and European made centers but I got it for occasional home use. A great deal for the price. Fits my Craftsman lathe, no problems. Be sure to keep it clean and well oiled."
1,Dead Bugs,"I looked forward to receiving 1500 ladybugs, hoping the tiny warriors would eat the aphids on my tomatoes. Delivery was 3 days later than scheduled. Amazon's usually stellar customer service, was mediocre at best this time. Today the package finally came. If there were 50 live ladybugs, I would be surprised. I put them on my plants tonight anyways, hoping for the best. Very disappointed with this purchase."
3,Cant make them stay!,"I picked two day shipping and got this a week later, two days after it was estimated to arrive. I was gone when they arrive so my dad put them in the fridge for me and when I got back 2 days after that they were are all still alive. I let them out at night like it said and then I put a fitted bed sheet over my raised bed so they couldn't fly away at night. They were all still there in the morning when I uncovered them but by noon half of them were gone and by the next day there was only 20 or so left and they were not eating any aphids that I could see. I guess you can't blame the company that sold them for the ladybugs leaving and not being hungry but I will definitely need to find a different solution to my aphid problem. Oh and no way was there 1,500, maybe 200, maybe even less."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I had quite an infestation of aphids on a large number of pepper plants. These didn't seem to make much of a dent in them. In addition they didn't seem to live very long either - just a few days. I found a soap spray repeated several times, though more work, did a better job."
1,Don't buy. All arrived dead (in November).,"I purchased the 1500 count. There were closer to 500 in the package and there were approximately 25 live lady bugs; even in November with 2 day shipping. Would not recommend whatsoever. Get them from your local garden store, they'll be cheaper and you'll actually get what you pay for; unlike with this item."
1,Not again,"I have been purchasing lady bugs for my yard for years now.This year I ordered 9,000 ladybugs through Orcon.At first my shipment was delayed, then UPS delayed it again and held them over at the UPS facility over a long weekend. I contacted UPS on a that Saturday so that I could save my ladybugs from the hot weather but UPS refused to deliver, or let me have access to them because it was a ""Saturday"" although these are live insects.Bottom line: Out of the 9,000 I ordered, only a few hundred were delivered alive. This bothered me not only in the sense that I did not receive what I bought for, but also that my purchasing from Orcon was instrumental in the loss of many little lives.Will not purchase from them again. They are great in delivering dead ladybugs though!"
4,Beware they will fly away.....,"fast delivery and all but a few where alive came from pa to AZ OK.... but there was no instruction but to release at dark and to just shake them on your plants ... so after 2 days i only see 5 out of 1500 ladybugs , next time i will put them in the frig to calm them down from the trip and also clue there wings using soda and water spray that last for 2 weeks to get them liking there new home after that they can fly. don't know if its cause we live in hot Arizona that they left my wildflower garden, but had many flowers and food for them......"
3,At first disappointed,"At first I was disapointed, as I waited and waited for the ladybugs,but once the company realized their mistake in not sending them, theyresponded quickly."
5,Love These Bugs!,"I am thrilled with my order of 1500 live LadyBugs. They just ""promptly"" arrived, packed beautifully, and they are all ready to enter my garden tonight after the sun goes down. Tomorrow the aphids on my Hibiscus Plants will be eaten alive by these lovelies.Thank you Hirts Gardens for this wonderful item. I have searched high and low everywhere for live lady bugs, and to no avail. All I kept hearing were - no we dont carry them or they are out of season. Not at Hirts. Transaction was smooth and easy, merchandise arrived intact and I am pleased with everything.Please ignore negative reviews you may have read about this organization. They are number one in my book."
2,I think they flew home.....,"The lady bugs arrived quickly. It looked more like 100 then 1500 in the small container. My husband wanted to know how they counted them. Most seemed to be alive and active. We waited until the sun went down and distributed them on all my fruit trees and garden plants. By morning we could not find one, that's right, not even ONE on our plants or land anywhere. I was so dissappointed. I wanted to see if they would work their magic so I would not have to use pesticides. Now I'll never know... Too bad......Great idea, I wonder how you make them STAY."
4,"Great Price, even though many were dead","Started a cycle of veggies in my backyard. Last year had issues with aphids and other bugs eating the plants so the ladybugs were needed. I didn't need 1500, and honestly I was surprised to get so many for so little. I expected a good number to be dead based on my expected shipping date, but it arrived earlier than expected (3 days after order) and I could still see alot in action. Followed the instruction and released them in flowers and plants surrounding my veggies, and coaxed a couple on the veggies leaves. Only time will tell how many will remain. I really don't expect that many to hang behind but if they do, great. I really don't need that many so this item was perfect for me. If you really need 1500, I would suggest ordering more. Alot will die, but what do you expect to happen when you ship a bunch of bugs in a box?"
2,Lady bug cemetary,Shipping was very fast and I was so excited! The lady bugs looked a little worse for wear in the package but I followed the instructions to a tee thinking that they might revive.Now I have about 5 live bugs and a ton of dead ones. The live ones are very happy but that isn't nearly enough. I am going to the local nursery to buy more. What a waste of money.
4,aphids,"many were dead when we got them but there were still alot. we didn't have too many aphids in our greenhouse so i think they either died or left and now, a few weeks later, we have a major aphid infestation. we're going to try praying mantises next."
2,Reasonable rates but no improvement on why I bought the bugs,"I'm going to start by stating that I bought the ladybugs for the aphids and other pests that have been eating my plants.For 1500 bugs the price and shipping was pretty reasonable, but when I released them into my yard they vanished after a day, and there was no significant drop in the amount of damage that I've found on my plants. I've found absolutely no ladybugs anywhere aside from dead in various places."
1,DEAD ON ARRIVAL,"Just about EVERY ladybug arrived dead. This was without a doubt the MOST disappointing purchase I have ever made from Amazon! And no, I was not about to pack up 1500 DEAD ladybugs to return. The shipping time was over a week to arrive- which may have explained the dead ladybugs..... Just disappointing!"
1,Dead Ladybugs for memorial service,"I recently purchased these ladybugs for my daughters memorial service.I recieved them June 6th finally..ALL DEAD..It was bad enough it took so long to get them here(supposed to be two day overnight) I have a picture of the box...very squished and with two day overnight on top of the box.The Memorial was June 3rd...they were not here, I was very disgusted an disappointed in the shippers..UPS..was out right lied to, way to many times in tracking them,the wait was horrible...a VERY BAD experience for me. I just don't want this to ever happen to anyone else.They were ordered May 28th and recieved June 6th. It is the principle.........I don't want my money back!"
1,Disappointing,"I ordered these and had them shipped with 2 day shipping. When the package arrived, I put it right in the fridge (like instructed). The next day I took them out and was ready to observe and release them with my preschoolers. Much to our disappointment, every single ladybug was dead. Oh, and NO way was there 1500. At the most, there were 150. This was a waste of money and I'm really disappointed in Amazon. I'm trying to see if I can get my money back. I don't want a replacement, as it's not as advertised and I'm worried that they would just arrive dead again. I would give it zero stars if that were an option."
2,They all left!!!,"I got them all alive! That was awesome! I followed the instructions. Three days ago i released them all after sundown in my backyard and front yard. In the morning they were all there, but after that, they all left!!! i have not seen ONE lady bug in my backyard...Can i return the empty container and get my money back?"
1,"Late, Dead, and not 1500","The item arrived late, all the ladybugs were dead,and it sure didn't seem like 1500. I should have thrown good time after bad money and counted the exact number, but I had already thrown them into the garden when I thought of it. Most expensive compost I've ever purchased :("
1,Not even close to 200 bugs in this container,"I hate to gripe about this purchase as I enjoyed releasing the few ladybugs that I did receive. Suffice it to say that I hand-released most of these little ladies and was done in under an hour. There were a number of ladybug corpses, but still only about 100 or so. I don't know what this company is doing when it comes to parceling out these bugs, but they need to find a new method.As for what the bugs did after they were released, well that isn't the company's fault. They do tend to wander off. Still, I keep seeing ladybugs near the release location and there were only about 100 of them to begin with. I feel like the few bugs hanging aroundI'd make a stink about being ripped off if I thought 10 bucks was worth the aggro. Still, this is definitely a case of ""buyer beware"". Go try your local nursery for bugs if you need them, that way you'll be able to see what you're getting before you shell out the money."
2,Where have all the ladybugs gone,The number of ladybugs was well well under 1500 probably less then 300. Then when released the next day I could not find many at all they clearly all flew away
1,gardening mom,"ordered these and they came 5 days past expected date of delivery, (temperatures very hot during this time period) when received only 15 ladybugs were alive, my husband and I poured them out and saved the live ones and returned the rest.. they were ordered with green lacewing eggs- which also arrived dead..WASTE!!!"
1,The majority of them were dead.,"I received the package late, the package was dumped upside down next to the door, and after refrigerating them for a day, i found the majority of them were dead. I would say under 100 actually survived to be released. Not very happy with this at all.After doing a little research (a little too late, but whatever, i found you can order them directly from High Sierra, which you can find online. Again, that is High ?@@#$# Sierra). Most of the distributors apparently purchase from them first, so why not avoid the middle man? I will be (no shipping costs either)."
2,Waste of money,"I got these ladybugs because I had a bad Aphid problem and I hoped they would help. I put them out at night like it said to do. The next day, I found only a couple of them left and the rest were on the ground - dead. Didn't work for me. Maybe the weather was too hot."
1,Waste of Money,"Actually, this is a no-star purchase. I ordered these ladybugs to help with an aphid problem in my garden. When they arrived, not one was alive! Not one! No need to follow the instructions about keeping them and releasing them. I wrote to the company directly and did not receive a reply. Don't waste your money on these."
2,"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow","The lady bugs arrived in two small plastic containers (~1500 of em). They were mostly alive. I followed the instructions. The beetles were crawling up, up, up, and around in circles, like little vacuum cleaners, along my dwarf birch's branches and trunks. I was very excited. However, the next morning, around 11 AM, I went out to greet the ladies, to see how they were doing, and there were NONE, zero, left. They must be enjoying a meal elsewhere. So I'm disappointed."
5,Great results,"Received the ladybugs on Monday so I know they were in transit during the weekend. I truly did not notice any died during the trip. I am impressed with how well they took to our oak tree that has been under attack by leaf curling aphids. Very pleased, will order again if needed. BTW my 9 yr old daughter enjoyed setting them free."
1,Some prompting required,"I bought this item in early July and it just showed up 3 days ago (End of July) I had to email Hirts to prompt them to send the item I bought. They apologized and sent it... you'd think they'd double my order or throw in free shipping for good measure. Regardless, if you buy these and don't get them in the first week.. be prepared to contact them."
1,Roasted Ladybugs,"Very sad. Ordered these bugs for my son's 6th birthday, and they were all dead on arrival. They could not have been in my mailbox for more than one hour, but it had to have been well over 100 degrees in there. It seems very irresponsible to mail these without some kind of climate controlled packaging, especially at nearly $20 a pop. Also, there is NO way there were 1500 ladybugs in there--not even close. Huge disappointment."
1,No luck with these bugs!!,"I was having a birthday party for my 2 year old daughter and thought that live lady bugs would be a great party favor given in cute bug boxes for all of the toddlers to have. As a former high school biology teacher, I have had a lot of experience in ordering live specimens. The day before my daughter's birthday party, all 1500 lady bugs arrived DEAD in my mailbox. Never in all of my experience have I seen live specimens shipped through the USPS, not labeled live specimen, perishable, or required a signature. These should be shipped 2 day Fed-EX or USPS with an email notifying of the arrival and guaranteed alive upon arrival. This was a pure disappointment to me!! My only hope is that this company will refund my entire cost."
1,aviod at all costs,"For staters this was not ""Ladybugs"" they didnt even begin to eat the aphids that were attacking my plants. It also didnt help that they didnt stay around long enough to find the bugs out of 1500 only 800 were alive when we recieved them then out of those 800 at least 700 flew away within the first hour. To sum up DO NOT BUY YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT INTO THE AIR AND FORGET ABOUT IT YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME RESULTS"
1,Find another solution for your garden!! This one isn't it.,"About 70% of the ladybugs I received were dead; there definitely couldn't have been 1500 in the package either. Most of them flew away, despite that I followed the instructions exactly (water the garden, put the bugs out there after dark, etc). These are not worth the money."
2,Mostly Dead,"AmountMost of the ladybugs that arrived were dead. Even if they were all alive, it was no where near 1500 bugs. MAYBE 600 and that would be a stretch.UsefulnessSome reviewers comment on instructions provided; there was no such thing in my box. There were some vague instructions on the little container itself, but nothing about an attractant or refrigerating the ladybugs. I released them at night on damp soil and they seemed to roost (they clumped together on branch stems and stopped moving). A few hours after sunrise the next day, however, they were all gone and never returned."
1,500 live lady bugs,This price is exorbitant for 500 live and sickly and 1000 dead ladybugs. I've ordered others from other companies and never had them arrive in such dreadful condition.
2,"No instructions, no lady bugs on plants",I received the order promptly but there were no instructions included. From reading others posts I released the lady bugs at dusk on well-watered shrubs. Two days later I cannot find any bugs. Guess they all left. A waste of money! Tried to call the seller but the number is not a working number.
1,All Dead,"Shipping was fast, but all 1500 ladybugs were dead. It was much too hot to have them sit in a mail box. Very sad and disappointing"
2,"Love the Ladybugs, Hate the Delivery","I love the concept of ladybugs eating all of my aphids, and I know that they do, as I've seen them at work. I would much, much rather get rid of the problem with ladybugs than some nasty chemical. The problem is that this company delivers via the U.S. postal service, so boxes of ladybugs get put into mailboxes. Of the 3,000 ladybugs that arrived at my house today, I'd say that 20 are actually alive, due to the 94 degree heat. A waste of time, resources, and ladybugs. I called the company and got a refund, and am trying one more delivery. But in the future, I'll buy ladybugs from a local nursery. Hirts needs to figure out a way to deliver ladybugs to doorsteps, not mailboxes."
2,Almost All Dead; Hirt's A Responsible Seller,"Almost all were dead, but Hirt's was polite and promptly refunded my money. It's June and the temperature is in the 90s in South Florida, I don't think they survived the heat during shipping. Perhaps they should be shipped in a cooler during this time of year."
1,"Nowhere near 1,500 bugs","There are nowhere near 1,500 ladybugs in this container - dead or alive. I would estimate merely 15 to 25% of that amount, or 225 to 375 individuals - about half of which were DOA. Not sure whose fault it is, but it took over two weeks for this shipment to arrive (mostly because the item was not delivered to UPS until 10 days after the shipment label was created). Slow service, blatant fraud regarding the number of bugs in the order - one star. At least there were some live, healthy bugs."
1,Very Disappointed,"By the time I finally got the lady bugs most of them were dead. I don't believe the seller shipped them when they said. Also, there was no way, I'll repeat, NO WAY, there was a count of 1500. maybe 150 but No Way 1500. I want a refund."
3,"Lady bug lady bug, where are you?","We purchased these and saw them around the house for about a day after we released them. Figured they would go nuts where we have large infestations of aphids and other little munching critters.... not so. Still have aphids, and teh only ladybugs we find are dead (and a lot of them too). Maybe just a bad time to purchase and release?"
2,That's why the lady is a tramp,"Lovely bugs. I had to get over my fear of them to introduce them into my garden. They stuck around for about a week and now they're all gone. I think the manufacturer should warn interested buyers that a lure will probably be necessary. I will admit, this purchase was by far the most interesting and entertaining waste of money ever. I have gained a respect for the little buggers that couldn't be bothered to stick around even though I offered them my extremely buggy plants for feasting."
1,Live ladybugs? Not so much,"Contrary to the description, which says ""Live Ladybugs,"" my order was just received and all the ladybugs are dead. I'm sure the one-week-plus shipping time across a country experiencing a heatwave had something to do with it; however, if the company can't guarantee the receipt of live insects, they should suspend shipping."
2,1500? i think not,who counted these for you? there is no way there are 1500 in the container i received. no way in the world. so you lied. you owe me an apology and a refund.
1,Horrible - box of DEAD ladybugs. Can't return them. Ripoff,"This is terrible. Bought these ladybugs, and they all arrived dead in the box. Disgusting and sad.To top it off, the item cannot be returned.Buy these from ""Hirt's"" (another source on Amazon). They shipped them with a small ice pack, a source of moisture for the ladybugs - and all arrived safely.I am protesting this charge on my credit card...."
2,So Sad,I got these for my daughters birthday party. I followed the directions about keeping them in the right temp. Not even 1/4 of them were alive. It was embarrassing to show my guests dead bugs. They did ship in a timely manner but I was disappointed.
1,Dissapointed,"Over 90 percent of the ladybugs were dead upon arrival at our home. I was home so the package did not sit around. I opened it right away, but 90 percent were dead. I would not order this item again."
5,Doing their job!,I ordered this for my greenhouse which has had an aphid explosion. Of course I read instructions after I opened the container...so I just ordered my second container. I ordered the 1500 count and I literally had maybe 4 dead ladybugs in the container which is far better than I expected. Read the instructions though as I released in the afternoon and they flew everywhere! I also read that you should wet the leaves of your plants before releasing as they will be thirsty at first and this would encourage them to stick around. Anyway..couldn't be happier with the product!
1,Ladybugs,"I received the ladybugs, placed them outside the same day I received them. Followed the directions...the next morning I had 3000 dead ladybugs in my garden. I called the store owner and they did refund my money.It is extremely hot in Florida right now and the owner said the ""trip"" and the difference in the temperatures was to blame."
5,GREAT,THESE LADY BUGS DID A GREAT JOB ON MY TOMATO PLANTS. IF I COULD ONLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THEM AROUND LONGER
3,Good,It was a good thing. to get this for free. it a good thing that I can use it. I would get again. You should try it today or tomorrow
1,Not Good,"When I noticed some spider-mites and corn leaf aphids in my garden, wanting to maintain the 'all natural/organic' condition of my veggies, I ordered 1500 Lady bugs to deal with it....(ordering was NO problem) BUT...the order form said 2-5 days shipping, well that's OK, perfect, I thought....10 days later I finally received the lady-bugs with half of them dead! I complained about this to the shipper, and basically was told to deal with it, that's the way it is and things should be alright....well, this is me 'dealing with it'....I would NEVER buy from this seller again nor do I recommend anyone ELSE purchasing ANYTHING from/thru Amazon.com!!!"
3,They all flew away,"Maybe I did something wrong, or there wasn't enough to eat, but by morning they were all gone."
1,dont bother ordering,"Dont bother ordering, I ordered on 5/27/11 and they arent scheduled to arrive till 6/6/11. I fully expect all of them to be dead on arrival. Actually, they finally arrived on the 6th and all but 4 were dead on arrival. What a RIPOFF! They probably wont publish this though."
1,Fly away,Yet another good but misguided idea. Within hours all your ladybugs will have flown away to eat aphids on your neighbors plants.Great to think about organic pest control but this is not one that works.You would be better off donating the money to your favorite charity.
1,Adult bugs not a good choice,"This product did not arrive two day shipping and I did get a shipping refund. The lady bugs were in good shape, but, I advise people to not buy adult lady bugs unless using them inside a green house or contained area. No matter how well the directions are followed, they will fly away and they will become food for birds. I really wasted my money on this product. Live and Learn"
1,Dead bugs,"I received the ladybugs and about 90% were dead. I am aware they can be dormant for awhile but I followed the directions precisely and after releasing them into the garden that was overflowing w/ aphids(food for them) only about 10% actually became active-the rest were dead. The worst part was my 3 & 4 year olds were so excited to release them into the garden-judt discover a bunch of dead ones. They sat for awhile waiting for many of them to move and checked back often to see if they ""woke up"" yet."
1,They never came in the mail - very disappointed,I thought the reviews were pretty good so I ordered the ladybugs through Amazon/Hirts. They never came when they were suppose to. I called Hirts and they said that they never shipped because the bugs were all dead when they received them. Good thing I followed up because this was a project for school. They get them from a 3rd party so be careful~ Try and find a company who sends them direct! There are a few.... if you Google Live Ladybugs a bunch come up. The only thing that stinks is that the over night shipping will cost you so much money. I paid $6.50 for the bugs and $32 for the over night shipping!! It was well worth it though! They came the next day and all were alive. If you need these by a certain date pay the extra money. If time does not matter then take the chance. I will always go direct.
5,Good price and we did get some Lady Bug larvae hatching.,"This is a good product if you want to get rid of an infestation of bugs. They won't get rid of all the aphids, but they do control the population on your plants. You actually want some aphids so the ladies are happy with your garden. We got these a couple of weeks ago and we have already seen some larvae and they sure are eating away."
4,Perfect at first...,"The ladybugs all arrived alive and energized. I let them out that very same day. But the next two days i found most (some might have left) of them dead in the grass. I hadn't used pesticide in more than a month. it was pretty sad, but i'd be willing to try them again soon."
1,Half of the Ladybugs were dead,"I was very disappointed with the service I received from Hirt's. I have previously purchased ladybugs only from the local home and garden center, but this year I decided to order on-line. I chose Hirt's because of the reviews that stated ""all the ladybugs arrived alive"". I ordered three packages of 1500 ladybugs so that my two kids could have ladybugs at their schools to disperse as well. I thought this would be a great experience for their classmates as my kids have loved doing this for the past few years. The kids were quite bothered my the fact that over half of the ladybugs in each bag was dead. What should have been a wonderful learning experience about gardening turned into answering questions about ""Why the ladybugs had died"". I don't know if all on-line purchases are similar to this one, but I would think twice about doing business here again."
5,Best Prank Ever,"Step 1: Obtain friend's car keysStep 2: Unlock fiend's carStep 3: Open doorStep 4: Open 4 buckets of 1,500 ladybugs totalling 6,000 ladybugs and place them inside.Step 5: Close doorYou're welcome and I'm sorry."
3,ladybugs,"most of the lady bugs seem alive, I put it out at night after it rained recently but the lady bugs flew away. I wished that it worked for me."
3,Lady bugs,"The lady bugs arrived alive, and well in a plastic container. I placed the lady bugs in the garden in the late evening as the directions said. Unfortunately, they did not stay in the garden. I guess this is due to the fact there were not enough pest present for a good food source."
1,Dead bugs don't do anything this is a waste of money.,This was a total waste of money and time 2/3 of the bugs were dead on arrival. I did not have time to order more as the event they were for was over. I paid for the fastest shipping possible and was going to use them right away. Just hope the helpful bugs live in your yard.....Don't waste your money as I did.
4,lots of bugs,"They arrived in excellent condition. I had the standard shipping. Am in Michigan and they were coming from Ohio so I didn't see the point in paying for express shipping. I'm not sure if my fridge was too cold or what but by twilight they weren't looking so hot. Didn't allow for enough time from spraying the garden with pesticide to adding the ladybugs. Most ended up dying. Seeings how they arrived very healthy, I think my mistakes led to their demise."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE ORDER,"I SENT FIVE EMAILS BEFORE I RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THIS COMPANY, THENIT WAS A VERY HATEFUL REPLY. I BOUGHT THESE LADYBUGS FOR MY ETERNAL FRIENDS GRAVE, AND THE COMPANY NEVER SENT THEM TO THE CORRECT ADDRESS.I SENT THE CORRECT EMAIL ADDY THE DAY I ORDERED THEM WHICH WAS OVER A MONTH AGO, THEY FINALLY EMAILED ME BACK LAST WEEK. I NEVER RECEIVED A REFUND, OR A I'M SORRY RESPONSE. HOW SAD IS THIS?"
3,Is there a certain time of year to buy ladybugs?,"I have seen several articles in some of my gardening magazines about buying ladybugs but never have. I just couldn't see getting live bugs in the mail. All the articles I have read say they are good for your garden but don't remember reading anything about time of year to put them out. So if anyone knows much about this process, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN OR IF THERE IS A BEST TIME TO RELEASE LADYBUGS..This was First time I've seen them on Amazon; I notice sale on gardening tools & supplies and happen upon them. Would like to try them but it will be October before I would get them. We still have some 70-80 degree temps in West Tennessee. So should I? or Shouldn't I?? That is the question. LOL Thanks for any responses..Note to reviewer on Color of Ladybugs: From what I've heard; Orange are females & Red are males..1500 Live LadyBugs - GOOD BUGS!"
2,Severely dissapointed,"Greatly anticipated 1500 ladybugs, but received a mere 1486. They must be shipping by volume instead of weight."
2,live ladybugs,"We ordered the 1500 live ladybugs for my daughter's prekindergarten class. I told all the teachers we would have plenty to share with all 3 classes. Unfortunately out of 1500 ladybugs only about half of them were alive upon arrival. We were very disappointed. We were told some of them would be dead, but extra would be included to make up for the dead ladybugs, so we were expecting around 1500 ""live"" ladybugs. We didn't have enough to share with all 3 classes. and the kids had questions about the dead bugs."
1,Goners,"I also released at night and found none in the morning and my plants are FULL of aphids. The company did not want to hear from us, we are extremely dissapointed."
1,100 live 1400 dead ladybugs should be their title,"more dead than alive- I maybe had 200 that were actually alive when they arrived, I'll never purchase from this company again"
1,All arrived dead,"Maybe it was too hot when these were delivered? Mine arrived. I opened it and from what I can see, they are all dead."
1,A lot of dead bugs...the rest flew the coupe,"The ladybugs were shipped in a timely manner. I followed the directions provided on how and when to release the ladybugs. First, half the ladybugs in the bag were dead. The rest began eating the aphids (I have a lot) the first night and were eating the next morning. When I got home that afternoon and checked on them they were all gone or dead. I feel like I wasted my money. Guess I will go buy pesticide."
1,Box was a mass grave for ladybugs,Lesson learned...do not order live things from amazon. Every sinlge one was dead on arrival. We released them from their tomb of death (aka the shipping carton) and dumped them in the garden to decompose further.When they were arrived they were brown and crispy looking like they had been dead awhile. Don't waste your money or their lives. Get your ladybugs from a local garden center instead.
1,NOT 1500,"I bought the 1500 container from my local nursery and there is no way the container contained any where close to 1500 ladybugs...it was closer to 150 half of which were dead. My 3 year old twins were overjoyed to see the ladybugs when we released them exactly as suggested, but by the next morning we only saw about 8-12 live ladybugs on our rose bushes. Try explaining this to toddlers! Great idea, but don't expect the number promised."
1,Dead Bugs. Every single one.,Our ladybugs arrived this afternoon via 2 day UPS shipping and ALL of them were dead. Not a single one was alive. And the worst part is this item is not eligible for a refund so basically I just bought a bucket of dead bugs. Buyer beware.
1,Arrived Dead!,"We were so excited to have these lady bugs for our vegetable garden however, all but about 20 arrived dead. I checked the mail daily so, it was not a matter of them being in our heated mail box too long. So, if there is even the slightest chance that they will perish from the heat in the Post Offices mail then the company should insist on overnight delivery or refrigeration delivery. We do not want another set as I can't imagine another 1500 lady bugs dying a slow death. Horrible!"
5,Live ladybugs,I order live ladybugs twice a year or more to release in memory of my daughter. Amazon has the best price and ar all alive open arrival.
4,Make sure it's the right time of year.,"We bought them in the fall to capture the aphids that got into the house from our garden, and they just went into hibernation, never to be seen again."
1,Dead,Didn't get any live bugs out of this even after warming to room temperature. Guess it was a nice try though
2,Few Live Ladybugs Made It,"The box arrived damaged, and the plastic container inside was crushed. I'm not sure if it was due to the trauma of being shipped, or the May Texas heat, but only a few bugs were still alive when we got the package opened. I would have estimated there were maybe 100-200 bugs in the container, and probably 50 alive, but it's possible some escaped due to the damaged container.For me, this is a lesson learned - I will stick to buying local when it comes to purchasing living things from now on."
2,Many Dead upon arrival,"Well, the price is OK, but while I expected some of the ladybugs to be DOA, it looked to me that out of 1500 about 300-400 came dead. I will look for local suppliers in the future."
3,Welcome to Old Blind Dogs Lite!,"The NEW Old Blind Dogs are back with their smoooooooothest cd yet, and if you've only been a fan since ""The World's Room"" was released, then you will probably like it. But if you go back to the Ian Benzie/Davy Cattanach days, ""The Gab O Mey"" is more likely to send you back to the rack for classics such as ""Five"" or ""Close to the Bone."" Often sounding like a group of session musicians for talented lead vocalist, Jim Malcom, the Dogs' BARK is generally worse than their BITE on this effort..."
4,Choo Choo,Here comes Matt Clark Railroad Detective on the case. Nice packaged set you get all three volumes. Quality is ok on some of these collections or boxed sets you get what you pay for.
1,Wish I Could Say Something Nice,"I'm a big fan of nostalgic TV westerns, so I bought this. I wish I could say something nice about it .... but I can't. I didn't think that I was familier with the show but as I was watching it I actually remembered seeing some of the episodes when I was a kid back in 19... cough cough ). Need I say that as I was watching, I saw WHY I didn't remember it. It's bad and not even the funny kind of bad, it's just the irratating kind of bad. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Aptitude testing leads a young man to a job on a clunky old ship, not one of the fancy new shiny commercial fancy pants variety.Through his apprenticeship he is forced to learn quickly, and spaceship maintenance and travel is not all.They discover a planet with aliens, alien goodies, have to fend off nogoodniks, and all that sort of fun stuff."
1,Mary Fahl's song is the sole redeeming feature,"..and Mary Fahl's song is available on HER OWN ALBUM,along with a lot of other equally beautiful tunes...That said,the score to this clunker,written by Mychael Danna is about as beautiful as a sack of yesterday's trash...Maybe if the guy had listened to Mary Fahl's song BEFORE writing this junk he might have been inspired to write something nice...This was a depressing film,little seen when in general release,but Danna's depressing music is just that;DEPRESSING...Some tunes are so heartfelt as to make one's heart ache with sorrow...Danna,in scoring this film,seems to have been determined simply to make one's ears ache and leave it at that..."

3,"Heavy Duty, but Lacks Etched Markings (Wide Stamped-Less Accurate)","Heavy weight aluminum alloy has a matte forged look with large molded markings (2-3 times size in width compared to tape measure markings). [Would be better if polished finish with etched markings, which are far more accurate.] I would not rely on markings for any work requiring very accurate measurements-not possible with this speed-square. OK for general construction use. It is very large, but the size makes it more usefull for general work where one has to draw uninterrupted lines."
4,Speed Square without speed,"The square is rugged and very good for guiding a saw router and such like, it is quite poorly made from an appearance aspect but has good functionality but is not ""metrified"" only being made in imperial.The sliding guide is again quite functional and appears somewhat poorly made but this masks the robustness of the unti"
4,Yep is it a speed square...,"Bought this for several projects in my future. It comes exactly as described, and is well built and should last."
5,Squared,"Product is as described. I like the larger size vs the smaller, I think it makes handling the tool easier."
5,You get what you pay for.,"I only buy swanson speed squares cause they take a beating. If you keep em in a tool bag that gets tossed around like I do, the cheapy plastic models won't cut."
4,version 2.5!,"Please note, this is not a reprint of the 2nd edition, but ""version 2.5"" i.e., a revised 2nd edition."
5,type junkie,"i had to buy this book for my typography class, this book is what it's all about. it explains in detail the origin and evolution of typography as its life is timelined to teach the deciple about what he needs. Bringhurst lets you know when to use type, how to use it, and where. as well as all the do's & dont's. I trust this man, you should too."
2,This Book Bugs Me!,"After the reading the reviews of this book, I couldn't wait to get it. But I tell you, the book bugs me. Why? Well first of all, i hate books that are organized like, 3.2.1, 3.4.6, for points. It totally breaks up a narrative flow, and it looks ugly. Second, the type is small, my wife saw that right away. Thirdly, he uses a wide border from text to page, so that I have to yank and pull and stretch the book wide open in order to see the text towards the binding. It's nuts! Now the irony here is that the author goes to great lengths in the book to explain the mathematical and musical formulas for page layout! My point is, the book is hard to read! Go figure.I'll dig through through this thing, but I tell you, sometimes the masters don't follow their own advice, or they are just too far gone!"
4,"Thorough, but dense","An insightful, thorough examination of the use of type. It's well suited to those seriously studying typography or seeking a deeper understanding of it to enhance their professional design work. But it may be a bit dense and esoteric for beginning students - it's certainly more than a light introduction. The author's evangelism on the profundity of type can be a bit overwhelming at times too - unless you're already a subscriber to the faith.That said, there's no doubt that type is a cornerstone of good design. This book will certainly help you build that cornerstone well."
4,Brilliant and lucid.,"Bringhurst gets at the heart of typography as an expressive medium. The work does not focus right or wrong, but poses reasons why one might make one choice over another.I think this may be the best book for someone just learning about typography to start with. At the same time, it is insightful for those with more experience."
1,A book for type junkies,"Not a guide on artfully combining different fonts. The book provides the history of where certain types came from, excellent for junkies, unfortunately not for me."
1,"Is it just me, or are Xbox games a little lame?","Before I start, I just want you to know that I own a Xbox system: I love the machine, I also love Halo. By no means am I just ragging on the system for no reason. The last 3 or 4 games I got for the Xbox have (...) WIND! (including this stupid game wrecklass. If you want to buy GRAND THEFT AUTO 3, just buy it; dont buy Xbox's lame version. Wrecklass is great looking, thats what sold me; but the game itself is way too coached and the story is weak. I was greatly disapointed with this game, I just hope Xbox comes out with better games in the future. Otherwise I will consider my Xbox to be the worlds most expensive paper weight.Wrecklass will be yet another Xbox game that I will end up trading in for hardly nothing."
2,Do not buy this game.,"Have you ever gone to the store, bought a game, gone home and popped it in, then turned it off 15 minutes later in disgust and realized you may have been better off spending the money on a rubiks cube? (that'll keep you busy longer). Well that's how most people are going to feel after buying this game. With an exception to the Beautiful graphics and appeal to younger gameplayers, this game is a waste of time, money and the plastic it was printed on. Theirs no leaving your car, theirs no free driving option, all you do is crash into other cars, that's IT! Spend your money on a game you can sit down and play for more than a half an hour, like HALO!"
3,Rent before you buy,"This game was not my cup of tea. I quickly got bored within 15 minutes of playing this game. Yes, the graphics are amazing (as advertised) but I found the gameplay shallow and plain boring. The good thing is that the levels are huge and filled with pedestrians, carts, buildings and traffic. Unfortunately, due to the timed mission-driven nature of the game, you never get to fully explore (which is what made GTA3 so amazing) the city. Also, unlike GTA3, you are not free to get out of your car and roam about. The basic gameplay is to crash into enemy cars/trucks/carts/etc. Surprisingly, the car physics is more sim than arcade. Personally I would have much prefered racing the streets of Hong Kong against other cars rather than chasing bad guys so I can ram them to death.I got pretty excited about this game 2 months ago when I saw a preview video but it's been a disappointment. I strongly recommend a rental before shelling out $50."
4,A game that finally utilizes the Xbox graphics potential.,"A quick and easy comparison for the style of gameplay would be Playstation 2's Grand Theft Auto 3. The only difference is that you don't get to walk around outside of the car, and you don't get guns...but...the graphics are phenomenal. This game fully utilizes the Xbox's potential as a graphical powerhouse. The streets are full of life and people, it almost looks real!There are two scenarios that each have about a dozen levels on them. As you progress through the game you earn new cars. The levels are huge and sprawling as well.This game is a lot of fun, and if you're looking for something feed your GTA 3 appetite, but you don't have a PS2, then get this game, you'll greatly enjoy it."
2,Lets see.... it looks good,"Well, it looks good, but that's about it. After reading all the hype about this game, I bought it the first time I saw it at the store. I got home and played it for about an hour and have not played it since. It's very repetitive. What's the fun in just smashing into stuff? All the missions are timed so you can't even explore the city. The vehicles are not the easiest to control either. I guess I was hoping for something along the lines of GTA3. All I can say is rent it first."
3,How I like wreckless,"I think this game is a fun game, but is to hard for me. I just think everyone should rent this game before they buy it. I give one star for the graphics, and one star for the competition."
2,good potential but rather poor,"this game isn't all its cracked up to be. Halo is a god of a game, so is JSRF, but this....well, its playstation quality. The driving controls are awkward, the graphics aren't great, the missions aren't that much fun, and i played it for about 2 hours and was sick of it. its not even two player compatible. I can't find any pros that arent' in all driving games. Wreckless is quite unremarkable."
