3,Very small tray,"I was expecting a much bigger bacon tray, although it was probably my own fault for not reading the description closer for the size. This tray only holds about 3-4 slices of bacon, and I was looking to buy a tray double this size. Just be aware that the size is very 'compact' for small microwaves (as the description says)."
2,Chewy,"I can only fit 5 pieces of bacon on this, one minute per bacon. When you cook it, the inner pieces cook faster than the sides. I guess I just don't like microwaved bacon because it was just too chewy and I like mine crisp."
4,Cooks good and easy to clean,"The rack does a very nice job cooking the bacon. We have had bacon racks that were hard to clean, this is not the case with this one."
3,Bacon cooks well,This item does its job very well but it is a bear when its time to clean it. It collects a fat film between its ridges and in its trough and it is hard to get it out.
3,Okay,"This tray is a little small.I've used bigger ones, but they crackedand I salvaged them with crazy glue - veryunsightly. I am trying this small onein hope that it won't crack. But I am not confidentbecause the bigger units are also made by the samecompany."
3,Bacon Rack,"It's too small, but that's my fault. Here we go with the stupid requirement again. And again And again Crap!"
3,Unnecessary,"I feel a little dumb for buying this.It's not hard to find something better in your kitchen if you want to microwave an egg for a sandwich. After buying this I realized a small tupperware is cheaper and serves the same purpose.I used it a couple times and while the egg cooked OK, the lid does fly open (as many reviewers have commented on), and the size is a little big (leaves egg hanging over the side of a standard english muffin)."
2,.......Item Used/ Damaged,"I rated this product 2 stars because this product arrived chipped and slightly stained even though it was a new purchase. Although I'm sure it was still functional, it was obviously a used, returned item."
1,"Just go to McDonalds, seriously.","I was so excited about this product that I purchased it to bring to a party as a white elephant gift. The present actually got stolen (can you believe it?!) but I thought it was so cool that I bought another one for myself. Boy was I disappointed. By the time you buy the ingredients to make your own ""Egg Muffin"" you've already spent as much as you would for the same number of $1-2 breakfast sandwiches at McDonalds or Jack in the Box, etc. However, what's most disappointing about this product is that the pan isn't even necessarily that easy to clean (it leaves a hot steamy mess of egg on the sides and bottoms), nor does the sandwich even taste that good! I added milk, salt, pepper, just like everyone advised here, and it most definitely tastes worse than fast food. I couldn't believe it either. I am returning this product and now I feel bad for my relative who stole this gift at the white elephant. Cheers."
4,easy eggs for breakfast,"I have only used it once so far but I am fairly impressed. Most of my tries cooking eggs in a microwave resulted in a rubbery mass that stuck to whatever I cooked them in. This cooker actually worked like a charm, in fact the only problem I had was that what I ended up with was too thick to really work in a muffin (I added sausage, green onion and a little salsa) so I ate it with a fork like an omelet. I can actually see using this if you want to go low carb, just because it refers to a muffin in the name of the cooker doesn't mean you have to make a sandwich. I gave it 4 stars because I haven't had it long but if I continue to be this happy it probably should be 5."
3,"Quick, easy, but oh the clean up","UPDATE MARCH 26: I discovered if I place a small microwave-safe plate on top of the egg cooker the lids stays down. No more egg flying all over the place. I used the egg cooker this morning for a couple of egg sandwiches and it worked perfectly. I do prick the egg with a fork before cooking and then cook the egg using our microwave oven egg poaching cycle. Turns out perfectly cooked every time.The Eggs 'n Muffin pan works as advertised and the egg does come out in the perfect shape for a homemade egg breakfast sandwich. Unfortunately the top of the egg maker does not stay closed while cooking. Bits of egg spattered around the microwave oven cavity which meant I had to wipe the interior down.Other than that, this little gadget works as advertised."
3,Not for me,Have found that microwaves and eggs just do not mix. Eggs become rubbery and therefore are not as tasty and visually appealing as those cooked in a regular pan.
5,Never cook bacon in a pan again.,"I wasn't sure about microwaving bacon until I tried this. My mom has one and in 4 minutes we had 4 perfectly cooked bacon slices. I sandwich them between paper towels - makes clean up easier. The only complaint I have is that the strips sometimes curl, but I have weighted them down with a small plate and that seems to solve the problem. I just wish it could handle more at once. 4 strips is about all that's ""safe"" so they don't stick together."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I'll say that I was expecting eggs from the microwave to taste rubbery and gross, but was surprised to find that this device makes really good tasting eggs in a quick and easy way. Literally takes a few minutes to go from ingredients to egg and cheese sandwich."
4,really liked it,i know all the glowing reviews i was a bit skeptical- until now when i'm eating the egg muffins and realize everything said by my fellow reviewers was spot on! i didn't even make them scrambled just put two eggs in the pan put it in the microwave and set it for a couple minutes when i soon realized it didnt need that much. the popping sound was a bit alarming - i'd forgotten about it- but the eggs are GOOD.. easy clean up and it didnt mess up my microwave- and breakfast was easy between toasting the frozen muffin and the eggs i had breakfast hot and ready in less than ten minutes. great purchase and product!
5,nice microwave egg pan,Arrived in timely manner for super saver shipping. Very nice microwaveable egg pan. Also has 2 in 1 function--also serves as a reheating pan for the finished egg muffin.
2,Lov's Baby Soft has changed!,"I was so excited to see Love's Baby Soft on your pages. I ordered several of the items only to learn after I received it, that the fragrance is just not the same. It used to smell soft and sweet like a freshly bathed baby, and now it smells cheap and a little brassy. It was meant to be a gift for my daughter who wore it all through high school, but I chose not to gift her with it because she would have been as disappointed as I.Sylvia Griggs"
1,Love Stinks,"Bought this for my daughter for her her birthday. I was VERY disappointed when she sprayed it and it smelled like gasoline. I thought it may have been the propelant, but, no, it was the spray itself. Not worth the time and effort to return."
1,I spy Fun!,"We haven't tried this game yet, but my 10-year old loves the I Spy books. He has three that he keeps at his bedside every night. What better progression than to pick this game. Very hard to find. Thanks Amazon.com. Santa will be visiting our house on Christmas eve. I spy a lot of fun for both my boys with this brain challenging game."
1,Time allowed for returns to be credited to account,"I am hoping that I get my credit to my account before much longer.when I placed the order it stated it was a video game, not a game boy game.I returned it 1 week after I received it for full credit to my account less shipping charges. this was on July 18,2003, certified mail.to day I have heard nothing.I would like to give the supplier a good report on the promptmess of shipping out my order, but will have to wait and see.(I can not rate this game as my granddaughter does not have a game boy. I had to put something in the spot)thanksBetty Lloyd"
5,Excelent cables,"Buy it for my old '96 Tacoma, and fits perfect, and my car increase the output power and fuel economy,"
3,Clever dialogue and delightful dish,"Though not one of Baxt's strongest (I would heartily recommend The Dorothy Parker Murder Case), there is enough clever dialogue and delightful dish to carry you through the rather weak plot. Baxt once again takes great joy in raking through the bones of celebrities, exposing the sexual proclivities and excesses of Hollywood stars. I found reading it enjoyable, though not completely satisfying as a murder mystery"
5,"Good Read, Good History","Terry C. Johnston provides an enjoyable book that appears to have a lot of valid history. His Plainsman series gives a pretty good view of what actually happened in this running conflict. His discussion of period politics, army operations, and tribal actions, are enlightening. A horrific period of our history, largely ignored and forgotten."
1,"Is he Sioux, or Cheyenne?","I have not read the book yet, butttt! In the synopsis, Crazy Horse is first called a Sioux, true, but he is actually a Lakota. Later he is called a Cheyenne, although the Cheyenne would love to call him one of their own, most novices know he was not."
2,Not as logical as you might think.,"I have a lot of problems with this book because there are arguments made here that don't hold water. At one point in the book the issue of mouth size is discussed as a determination of the predator's prey, suggesting that they are directly linked. It's simply wrong. There are tons of examples (like whales, wolves, etc.) which contradict this speculation. I am surprised more people don't make note of this. He may be a good writer, but not everything he says is on target, and you should maintain a critical view of his points."
2,seek ecology elsewhere,"The author does okay in the beginning when he sticksto the physical principles underlying ecology. Unfor-tunately, later chapters are tarnished when he mixesunsubstantiated (and outmoded) opinion with fact.Indeed, parts of the book are better suited to an edi-torial than a work on science.The world has moved light-years on in the twenty plusyears since this book was written. The publisher doesus a disservice by keeping it in print."
5,Love it!,"I Love the product,I work in tha Nursing field so i take Vitals everyday and get fast Accurate results from the Blood pressure Cuff."
1,Not worth your money,"I bought for personal use three months ago, the first few times it worked alright but I never used it more than 10 times before it stopped working. I thought perhaps the batteries were low, I exchanged with new ones but it will not inflate at all. Do not not throw your money away cheap is expensive. I now have to spend money on another one."
1,wimpy,"I tried one of these blood pressure monitors, and it didn't have enough power to inflate itself. I tried 3 sets of brand new batteries, and I tried it on my husband as well as myself - wouldn't work. I had to return it. A complete waste of money, time and energy."
1,Very Dissatisfied,Just received this product and it's readings are inaccurate by 20 points. Tried it numerous times and had 2 family members also try it. The same thing happened. The reading was off by at least 20 points higher. I am very AGGRAVATED and DISAPPOINTED that the product DOES NOT WORK! Now I have to go through the hassel of shipping it back.
1,Very inaccurate,I've had mine for about 9 months. It is terribly inaccurate. It will produce results as much as 20 points different on consecutive readings. Not reliable.
5,highly recommend!,"This device works great. It is finicky. If you are not in the correct form that is explained in the instructions, then it will either say ERROR (err) or the reading will be quite off. Other than that, it works perfectly. I bought this device for my dad who has a heart condition."
1,Don't waste your money,"This has been our first experience with an at home blood pressure monitor and I have to say it's been awful. Both my husband and I read the directions and did exactly what they said to do with confusing results. My husband has high blood pressure, mine has never been a problem in fact at the doctor's it's always perfect. When my husband questioned his results, one minute high the next minute low I tried taking my blood pressure. I received the same results. It doesn't seem to matter what time of day we used the monitor and we've tried everything. I'm very disappointed with this product and feel I've wasted my money."
4,finally i have it..,"As im from England ive had this cd for a round a month before you Americans ha ha ha.Why did Pink Floyd have to moan as there are two tracks missing one which contains ltj and rbf horn players.Anyway the album is great especially ""yummy down on this"" and ""three point one four"" that has the best chorus around ...this kicks"
5,Ten Stars,Is Jan Burke capable of writing anything bad? I read Bloodlines yesterday and miss Conn and Jack already. I won't go into a detailed review as that has been done here already. I've been reading Jan since the beginning and when I think she can't get any better she proves me wrong every time. Don't let the length of the book put you off -- I wish it had been twice as long.
2,Disappointing.,"While I think Ms. Burke has real talent, this book left me cold. Despite all the other very positive reviews, I found the ongoing ""back-stories"" confusing and hard to follow. Our ""heroine"", Irene Kelly, doesn't even appear until page 149! And there are just too many characters, and too many family relationships to keep straight. Not to mention too many references to other plot-lines not being explained in this book. Perhaps this book should have been separated into two, or even three, stand-alone books. I think ""Bloodlines"" would have benefited enormously from more capable editing."
3,"Average ""Who done it""","Enjoyed reading this novel, not an exception mystery, but good enough to hold your interest and keep you into the book."
3,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this after reading all these glowing reviews. I love Danielle's music, but this is not even close to being as good as Arrive all Over You. Definitely not worth the inflated price being asked for it."
5,Joan Baez at her best,This album and Volume 2 are Joan Baez at her best. The cool soprano voice and the clearly understood verse are evident here. Great emotion is achieved with her ability to balance the timbre of her voice to the story of the ballad. The accompaning guitar is fitting. The choice of the songs and the order of their presentation are perfect. The quality of the re-engineering is very good considering the original is over forty years old. All in all a masterpiece.
4,This is THE folk album to get...,...nearly every girl singer to come out of the 60s was inspired by Joan Baez and countless singers covered these songs after her. You won't know folk or what the fuss was about without this album. Very essential.
5,Joan Baez,"Would give it 6 stars if I could. Some of her earliest work.If you love her, what's not to love?"
1,Where's The Thesis,"I am very interested in the topic, but this book quickly disappointed me once I got past the introduction. This really isn't a book at all. Instead, it's simply the author's research. It's a collection of quotes he culled from various sources. There's minimal context, synthesis, or analysis. Therefore the book doesn't stand on its own as a scholarly work that supports a clearly articulated thesis. This might be a good book one day once the author actually writes it!"
1,Poorly written fantasy,"This is basically a rewrite of Ammachi's original biography, written by her most senior Super Swami Amritaswarupanunda. I guess it wasn't good enouph. The original was first published in 1988. In my opinion, both are pure fantasy. I call this one the ""watered down version for dummies.'"" (westerners) The original is more informative as to who this charlatan is pretending to be. Check out my reveiw.I also wasted 10 years of my life following Amma around the world. This book is a con job at best. Don't waste your time, money, spirit, or your life! I have my copy next to the toilet, as the paper is nice and soft for wiping. I seem to feel much better after I flush."
5,Beautiful and inspiring book!! She is a saint!!,I am reading the book right now. Amma is an inspiration to the entire world. Her life is a model for everyone.
4,Very durable and capable drill and flashlight,"Drill has tons of torque and casing is very well built. Drill speed is some slow, but not really an issue for most jobs. Highly reccomended."
3,Factory-Reconditioned Makita,"I was dissappointed that the keyless chuck was in very poor condition. Although the drill works flawlessly, it looked as though the chuck had been friction burned - quite ugly looking. I figure I got what I paid for - great light and drill but kinda wished I'd paid the extra bucs for a pristine new drill. The flashlight and batteries appeared new."
4,Good,This product was a gift for my nephew. He really likes the music tracks and listens to them all the time.
4,Outstanding Lyrics,"I first heard this song done by a local group (Desert Moon) and I was struck by the lead singer's delivery - so much so that I knew I had to have it. WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME has been an integral part of my personal reawakening and has given me a new awareness of different types of music that heretofore was ""background"" stuff. If you're looking for something that speaks to your heart, this is it. Powerful, poignant, and true to real life. Thank you."
3,Son loves it - Father thinks it's just okay,"This is very first generation computer graphics. My son (9) loves it as he thinks the stories are great. I (the father) think it's badly written and the graphics are quite poor. Yes, the graphics are first generation so I realize they are no where near today's standards, but I've seen much better from this time period. Thus, children who like Transformers will probably like but adults who require a bit more sophistication in their stories will likely roll their eyes and groan (like I did) when watching this with their children."
4,Return to Childhood,I watched this show when I was growing up and loved it. I finally decided to search it out and try to find the series and it was well worth it. The show was every bit as good as I remember from when I was a kid.
2,"Was hoping for quality improvement, still looks awful.","I own the original RHINO DVD release of this series (season 1 anyway) and after watching some of it recently with my son I noticed how poor the quality of the video was, like VHS copy of a copy quality. I assumed it was due to it being a rather old DVD and since my son and I were having a good time with it I decided to pick up this newer version so we could watch the entire series.I watched some of it tonight and was really disappointed to find that the video quality is only a tiny bit better. It is still VHS quality at best and just repackaged with a newer menu interface.By today's standards the animation looks really dated, but I'm fine with that, it is what it is. I am a fan of the series, it's still as good as it ever was as far as story, characters and such, but until this gets remastered onto Blu-ray, I would not recommend buying it.If it weren't for my sons interest in finishing the series, I would send this back."
4,Good idea but elastic too tight at the ends,"I bought several pairs of BabyLegs for my daughter when she was born. They are really cute and a good idea for keeping legs warm when my baby is wearing a dress.As a newborn (0-3 mons) she wore these comfortably. However as she got closer to 3 months, I noticed that there were red marks around her thighs from the elastic. (My baby was in the 75% for weight and 90% for height.) I thought that maybe my baby just had fatter thighs than other babies, but after reading another customer's comment, I think the problem is with the product itself. The elastic should really be looser/wider at the top to prevent the red marks.Now that my baby is 7 months, she wears them only over the lower half of her legs, but still has red marks from the elastic. She is still about 75% on weight and 90% on height."
1,Kodak USB Cable.,I sent an email when I received the dock and cable and said it was the wrong one. It is the wrong size for my camera/camera would not fit on the dock. I heard nothing in response to my email so I pitched the camera and donated the dock & cable to a thrift store.
1,digital camera - cable,"Not only did you send the wrong cable, it was most difficult to return for a refund."
1,No help from Citi Electronics,I searched for the Kodak USB cord for a Kodak M583 camera and this cord came up. Unfortunately it is not the correct one but there is no return option with Citi Electronics--BEWARE! Now I am out $ and have no cord for my camera!
4,Could use a better item description,"I bought the cord for my camera and it didn't fit, had to go to other website to find correct part number. Company was awesome about the return."
1,Not even 1 month -used 3 times- burned out Bulb,Don't buy these crummy bulbs. The bulb died after a few uses of the projector.Bought Oct 1 died Oct 20
3,kinda crappy,these lamps are cheap and dont seem to last long. My fixtures ran less than 100 hhours and these blew out
5,Excellent semi-popular exegesis of the text,A semi-popular exegesis of the 1 Corinthians. Wonderful grasp of the connectedness of the epistle and its location in a Greco-Roman culture. Written by one of the world's experts in the Greco-Roman New Testament world and a specialist in Pauline theology. Ph.D. from Princeton. Teaches at Harding University Graduate School of Religion
3,Lot's of fun!,"Every dog lover will identify with this book. Dog Codependents is humorous, but full of truisms. Planet Hueneme"
3,"An excellent sampler, but no substitute for experience.","The first half of Michael E. Leek's Encyclopedia of Airbrush Techniques is devoted to technique and real-world examples of how techniques are used. The second half illustrates themes of professional work, and how they exemplify various techniques and design concepts.To a total beginner, this book is filled with detailed steps and explanations, but does not qualify as a first how-to book. The examples and pictures describe brush technique well enough, but do little to enlighten how and where the masking is applied and removed. The photos range from simple to enticing, and are a good basis for practice ideas and experimenting with the airbrush.To an intermediate airbrush artist, the techniques are a good example of method, and may help round out a repertoire of skills. Vivid selections of advanced professional airbrush work cry out for a more advanced book of technique combinations."
3,Great guitar player,"Randy Bachman from the Guess Who and Bachman, Turner Overdrive is a great guitar player. I saw him in concert and he was great. He was really too good for The Guess Who and really showed how good he could be in Bachman Turner Overdrive. This CD is a dissapointment as it shows a variety of Bachman's songs, but they are not all his best. I guess I really wanted Randy Bachman's greatest hits. Anyway it gives a good sample of Randy Bachman's music."
2,Somthing isn't quite right,For some reason this bottle doesn't smell like the one I got when it came out years ago. And something has been scratched off the glass on the bottom... I am suspicious
1,Terrible,"I got this game for Christmas, so don't blame me for wasting money. The graphics or basic and bland, animation is limited and sloppy, and controls are very awkward. The music is limited to a soundtrack of less than 10 songs, none of which are impressive in the least. The story is horrendous as well; it seems like a bad dub of a kung-fu movie. This game brought no fun, only frustration."
2,Impress,"Traditional Gamer - See "" Golden Sun"" for more information. This was a hell of a lot better than ""Altered Beast"". The game controls were some waht difficult, but I got thru it OK. If I had to rate this game it would have been 2 and one half stars."
5,nice game but why is the ninja blue?,"why is the ninja blue? ninjas must be black!other than that, a fun game, jumping and attacking.haha not bad."
1,Horrible.... save you 5 dollars,"This game should be laid to rest. It is boring and is nothing like the classic Shinobis, it like not even looks 8 bit...... looks like 4 bit. Don't be fooled by the cool atwork on the cover........ like me :("
1,worst game ever!,"i did not buy the game but i was going to but then my friend had the game so i borrowed it. it is very hard and the staris are very hard to get down. don't waste your money i am glad i bought another game, the other game i bought is called Need For Speed Underground(great game)."
1,Reconditioned Makita Belt Sander Not Reliable,"I was pleased with the price of the factory reconditioned Makita R9910 Belt Sander, but after VERY limited use, I find it would not start with out a ""push"", and now, after owning it for 2 years, but using it very little, it has refused to start at all. I have been unhappy with its poor reliability and would not buy another reconditioned Makita product."
3,VERY TIME CONSUMING!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The concept for this game is too cool to be ignored. The problem is in order to make one move correctly you will be spending at least 5 hours. If you have the patience then go ahead it will pay off. I had this one guy do the stone cold stunner ( 6 hours) and the f-5 (9 hours). Also had one girl who, lets just say sucked the energy out of you. This is very cool to see when its completed but it takes FOR EVER. Also the parts given for you to create some one is pretty shallow. The fun is in creating the moves. I stoped playing cause I got vice city. If you have time and patience then buy it. Otherwise it will just end up collecting dust in your room."
3,Sad graphics,"i only gave this game 3 stars because the whole idea of creating your own fighter is just too cool! And that part of the game is fairly decent, it takes awhile to get used to programming the moves. the graphics on this game are Horrible and the game play is definately not up to par with Tekken 4. so if your looking for good gameplay and graphics this is not a good choice. but if your looking to sit around forever to create that perfect fighter then its worth a look"
5,Insty Quick-change countersink,"This is the second of this type countersink I have bought here. As always, Insty products are great !"
5,the review above is wrong,"Tavist is NOT one of the new generation of nonsedating antihistamines like Claritin (loratidine) etc. I don't know what the above reviewer was thinking; perhaps he or she got confused from taking too much Tavist. It contains clemastine, which is more recent than but akin to the older generation (chlorpheniramine or Chlortrimeton, diphenhydramine or Benadryl, etc.) of antihistamine, though for most of us not as sleepy.(Benadryl is the worst for many people but so heavily promoted that it is all some docs prescribe, practically.)Btw, all can be gotten generically at most pharmacies."
3,"Its a text book, how good can it be?","I have to admit, the textbook is what it is, a textbook. It has all of the most boring theories you would ever want to read but, on the other hand, it's what our professor wants so it's not like I have any choices. Honestly, I think the book could use some refreshing and be updated to make it easier to read.It's hard to read and this is a subject I enjoy... I wish they'd make this into an ebook and make it more affordable but the authors haven't updated it in forever so. Well, happy reading and hang in there, the class will end at the end of your term and you get to shake the cobwebs out of your skull and have a life. Until then, start reading early and frequently to get all you can for your classwork."
3,If Your Main Interest is Texas Trilogy...,"This is a nice collection of Fromholz's work, but the sound quality is barely ok. If you are primarily interested in ""Texas Trilogy,"" which has become something of a legend, I would recommend going for the book ""Texas Trilogy : Life in a Small Texas Town"" by Craig Hillis and photographer Bruce Jordan, which is a fine book in its own right and includes a CD of the song digitally re-mastered from the original tapes. And yup, I own both, and the version that comes with the book sounds much better."
2,Disappointment,"I don't know enough about this album's genre to be as insightful as some of the other reviews, so I will just lay it on the line: I was really disappointed by these songs. I thought they sounded quite dated, almost cheesey and kitschy. I bought the album because it was compared to that of Willis Alan Ramsey whose cd I have darn near worn out from overplay. It was also compared to Guy Clark who I really enjoy. But I find their songs' lyrics have made the journey over the past 30 years intact. Fromholz's by comparison seem gimmicky. Songs such as ""Everybody's Goin' on the Road"" and ""Sweet Janey"" are more silly than insightful.One positive thing I can say about the album is that you get to trace some of the influences of modern acts such as Lyle Lovett through the song ""Bears."""
2,Nothing special,"Bands like this are getting championed in the UK music press this year, simply because it's been a weak year in terms of new releases. This is distinctly underwhelming music, do yourself a favour and buy a Wire album instead, I recommend Pink Flag."
5,these guys blow away the arctic monkeys,"this is a very good cd, that lives up to the hype, unlike the over rated wankers called the arctic monkeys. Some very catchy rock tunes here, and an awesome ballad 'move on now'......highly recommend......one of my top3 cd's of the past 7 yrs.....along with interpol's 1st cd...and the strokes 1st cd."
1,SMALL AND NOT AS DESCRIBED!,"1st, this is not a ""Large"" Aquarium piece at all. 2nd, the measurements are more like 10.5""x3""x4 1/4"", and 3rd, the coloring is NOTHING like the photo. The ""Rum"" words are barely made out, the green is very dark, not light, and the overall painting is dark and dismal, not that of any aquarium piece. I feel very taken by this listing, and am glad to be able to return. I would in no way recommend this unless you have a small aquarium, 10 gallons or less, and do not like color involved."
4,Another gift of pure beauty from Lori Carson,"I am a huge fan of Lori Carson's music. She creates music of stunning purity while conveying experiences and sentiments with which we all can identify. Stars sounds like a bit of a departure from her earlier albums -- less acoustic and more groove oriented at times, but still peaceful, gorgeous, and definitely Lori. She is one of those artists who has not fallen into the trap that so many have - she sticks to music that feels intimate, close to her own heart, and avoids molding her sound according to what will be accessible to the masses. Lori's music is for those who appreciate sitting at home with a cup of tea by the fire. It warms the heart."
2,"I love Lori, I couldn't take to this album...","I think there's two reasons why I'm cool to Stars, but love much of her other works: (1) the production is overblown, and (2) the songwriting just isn't up to par.These two problems work in concert on Stars. Face it, despite anything David Gray might tell you, some music isn't cut out for sampling. Sometimes I feel Lori is a folk musician in denial.For a better taste of Lori's incrediable talents check out Everything I Touch Runs Wild, Where It Goes, or, if you can find it, Shelter."
1,"""Stars"": Dim","I thought I'd give Ms. Carson another try, bought ""Stars"" and was disappointed. I've liked one or two tracks from her past records, but for the most part she seems intent on making a career out of writing/singing the same song (i.e., the repetitive choruses, the cloying vocals, and the plodding, unvarying tempo). My girlfriend called this CD ""excrutiating"". Occasionally there is a unique turn of phrase and some nice string and guitar work on this record, but by and large it is the same old fare. Does she only aspire to make music that belongs in an episode of Dawson's Creek? Obviously a lot of people seem to like that sort of thing, but it begs the question: Is this really the extent of the artistic vision that once captivated me on the Golden Palominos albums? Perhaps she should just stick with collaborative work. From now on I will save my money."
1,The Never Ending Story,"Ms. Carson's latest paean to her preciousness leaves this listener wondering how anyone so minimally talented can continue to find labels willing to distribute this solipsistic, self-absorbed school-girl drivel. The waif-like vocal stylings, designed to enfold us into a confessional embrace is only enervating, never liberating, for in these confessions the direction is always down, the atmosphere always joyless.This is third-generation Plath, second generation Joni, but without insight or humor, just suburban petulance and fake mysticism."
2,not good enough,"This product was meant to replace a single egg microwave poacher, but since I purchased it I've gone back to my old one and thrown this one away.1. It doesn't stay closed during cooking. Had to use a rubber band to keep it closed.2. The hinge does not open and close correctly, It often locked up in the open position and you had to fiddle with it to get it to work again.I'm not faulting it for not cooking eggs perfectly - that's the problem with trying to microwave eggs. That's not the fault of the product. But you have to realized that the more eggs to you try to cook at once, the more the problems with microwave surface. The eggs were consistently undercooked on the parts in the center of the cooker, while the egg sections towards the outsides get overcooked.But this low rating is simply about the mechanics of the product."
4,Works well,"Produces decent eggs, and my 10 year old likes it because it's easy & safe enough for her to use by herself."
2,"Not worth the price, at any cost","This thing does not work as it should. The buttom is round, so you end up with a little ball, rather than a flat egg. It does not close properly, so there is always a mess as the egg spills out."
5,"Believe it or Not, Really Good Product","I'd seen products like this on infommercials and laughed thinking they were such a joke. Then I visited a friend in Canada who had several of them. He swore by them. We actually used them every day while we were there and had to buy one when we came back. Typically we wake up and try to eat within 15-20 minutes of waking up. Its hard if you don't like cereal to make that happen. But with this product we are able to do it easily. Just put an egg or pour egg whites inside with salt, pepper, whatever other spice you want, and then microwave.Great, simple, quick breakfast."
1,Third time charm?,"So far, I've bought, used, and thrown away 2 of these gadgets. After only a few uses, each of them developed a surface texture which made them almost impossible to clean; even drowning the cups with oil would not prevent sticky egg build-up. [I DO know how to ""baby"" microwave cookware, and how to avoid scratches -- made no difference.] However, having just now read a couple of reviews which mentioned that the microwave ITSELF might be to blame, I'm game to try once more, since I have a new microwave. The hinges, incidentally, remained just fine. :)"
3,Egg poacher,The only problem with this item is that it does not cook even.The egg is either too done or not done enough.
5,Great product,Great little product I use it every day and love it. Would recomend it to anyone who wants a fast and eazy egg in the morning.
3,Worth $5.00 but not much more.,"I tried this microwave poacher the night I received it. I poached 2 eggs and didn't realize I needed to poke a hole in the whites and the yokes so it exploded. The next time I poked them, it still exploded (but not as badly). Now I make sure to put paper towels underneath and on top for this reason. As another reviewer mentioned, his broke at the hinges. So did mine at first attempt to wash it. That's fine, it still works as intended. It's difficult to create a runny egg (requires more water, adjusting the cook time, and no poking), but with enough practice it can be done. It's not nearly as good as pan frying or poaching an egg of course, but when you don't feel like going through the effort, this is a decent solution. I like that this little poacher gives me the option to take a package of English muffins and a carton of eggs to work and make an egg sandwich for lunch or breakfast."
5,great at work,I needed a egg cooker for the microwave at work and this works out perfectly .. glad I bought it ..
3,Instructions Could Use Some Work,"I got this about a week ago and I love it! I've only used it one but its sooo easy to use. The only complaint I have would be the fact that it's not dishwasher safe. I looked all over the packaging and on the product itself and it never says it was. Also the cooking temps are completely wrong but that may be my microwave. It says two eggs take around 60-75 seconds, but it took more like 45 and the egg was complete cooked and a little rubbery. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
4,This comes in very handy in the morning busy time...,"A good convenient item, and saves a lot of time in the morning. However, it does not close tightly and the egg beat leaks out while getting cooked in the microwave."
4,For a fast breakfast,"This is very easy to use. It poaches two eggs in about 1 minute and the cleaning is a snap if you do it right away. The only problem is that it cooks the eggs a little unevenly. There is always one that is well done and one that could use a bit more cooking. That doesn't bother me too much, but if you like your eggs perfectly poached, stick to a more traditional stove-top method. But for super fast eggs without a pan to clean, this is ideal."
4,Have to punch egg yolk with tooth-pick!,"Review by Dan of Arlington said his eggs exploded. I never had this problem. Egg yolks have to be pricked with a tooth-pick before cooking. I butter each cup lightly with butter, salt and pepper each cup, add eggs, a little more than tsp of water in each cup. Micro on high for 1 minute & 15 seconds, let rest for a minute. For speed & no hassle it's great!"
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried this thing on every possible setting and at every length of cooking time and combination thereof, but no matter what I did, my eggs either came out runny, or exploded. I broke down and learned to poach my eggs the old-fashioned way, which really isn't very hard at all."
4,"this is a valentines day gift for my son,I already have one","I like my eggs cooked this way, only takes 1 minute. only dislike ,if you go over that mimute they can over cook . My son complained eggs made too much mess in kitchen and not worth the time. this cooker is quick , clean and eggs taste taste good every time"
1,Not worth it,"I got 12 of this type of egg cooker and they went to the trash. Yes if you play around with the settings and stir up the eggs at the start and half way through it can work. But why bother when you can put two eggs in an uncovered 10 oz. microwaveable dish, beat them into an almost scrambled form add seasoning, cheese, etc and cook them the time needed at full power. I would give it zero stars but that is not an option."
4,Egg Poacher,Very good product - easy to use and a breeze to clean. A very healthy way to enjoy your morning egg.
1,Biggest Waste of Money EVER!!!,"I paid WAY too much buying this from Nordic Ware directly. No matter what I tried, more water, less water, more cook time, less cook time, the eggs were awful. What I had was either hard boiled eggs or raw whites, nothing in between. Nordic Ware couldn't have cared less when I contacted them. I agree with the other reviewers on the hinge issue, they are terrible. Can't open the cooker smoothly as they stick or the top completely falls off. Not at all a quality product - save your money and use your stove."
1,Terrible product!,"I have tried varying the time, temperature, amount of water, number of piercings, but NOTHING works. I end up with uncooked eggs or a mess in the microwave. I cannot recommend this product."
1,Cheap and breaks easily,This is made from very cheap plastic. The hinge snaps off EVERY TIME I open it. It's a pain to put back together after you have the eggs in the wells. You can get better versions at grocery stores for a lower price.
2,Used it half a dozen times then hinge broke,"The eggs stick to the inside of this thing unless you use a bit of cooking spray, no big deal. The hinge is flimsy and it broke around the 6th time we used the poacher. Took it back for a refund.Nordic Ware's Eggs 'n Muffin Breakfast Pan works a little better, and also hold larger eggs (although only one at a time)."
4,Nice,"Titanium watch from nike... I love this watch first time I got it... the way it looks, simple but cool... sadly, because of the size of the watch I have to return this back... one other thing, this watch should be even better if the light is brighter..."
4,Trimmer replaced the need for small push mower.,The Poulan Weed Eater replaced a small trimmer that we had for years. Before purchasing this Weed Eater we used a small push mower to get the areas the ride mower couldn't get. Then we trimmed with a small trimmer. We have eliminated the need for the push mower because the new WeedEater covers such a large area. I have only used it as an edger one time and didn't master it right away but we have a large edger so it will not be a problem. We haven't had it long but so far we are truly pleased with it. It cuts really well and is light and easy to use.Shirley
5,Hasn't been sold in stores lately,"Its sad when you have a weedeater and no one sells the refills for it any longer but it works great, hopefully you'll continue to carry it for me..."
5,Avishai Cohen - A Gift to this world!!,"i'm so glad i purchased this album.i had so much wonderfull experiences with this music.certainly - there is something hidden over there, something you just can't tell what it is, and you don't wanna difine it. simply the presence of LOVE.buy this one - it's a healing music, so uplifting and full of gentle mussages of love.that album is the reason why i making music, with an ensemble - with one goul - to sound like ONE BEING, with a clear worldless message.amazing."
2,It's Okay?,"The age should be from 2-3 years,not any older.If you are older than 4 it wont work they will get fed up with it."
1,Not as advertised,"Shower curtain says it is extra wide, but what I received was extra LONG. Hassle to return."
5,Good thick shower curtain,"This is shower curtain is used in our stand-up shower. The plastic is nice and thick, so it doesn't move/flop around once you pull it shut during your shower. Since it is thick, it is a bit more stiff, but it works for us."
4,Fit the bill,This came reasonably quick and packaged well. In fairness husband decided to buy a fancy enclosed steam shower so I can not speak for wear but the initial quality is there. It is not super thin to tear easily and is a nice crisp white.
3,Color not as described,"The liner arrived on time, and the quality and size are as described, but I did not think the color description was accurate. The color is described as ""bone"", but it's actually a pinkish beige. I was going to return it, but return shipping was almost as much as the liner cost. If you're looking for a good, heavy-duty shower curtain liner, I would recommend it, but be aware that the color may not match what you consider ""bone""."
5,"1+ year, liner still holding strong","We installed our shower curtain high in the bathroom and couldn't find an extra long shower curtain liner in the brick-and-mortar stores in my area. We purchased two of these liners when we closed on our house in August 2009 - we still have the original liner in place. It is strong enough to hold up - the holes for hanging have stayed nice, and it seems to be grime-resistant. We've given the liner a good scrub from time to time, but as long as we use a daily shower spray {We prefer the shower spray by Method} it stays mildew free. Any grimey spots have been scrubbed clean with a squirt of Dr. Bronner's soap.I am used to having to replace the plastic shower liners every few months - we are coming up on 2 years with the same liner - very impressed!"
5,Great product and service,"This is a strong, really clear, deluxe shower curtain. It's extra long, high quality, and very thick, and arrived promptly. I'm very pleased!"
5,Extra Long,"It has taken me a long time to find a clear shower curtain liner with this length, but finally I did. In fact this liner was too long and I had to cut it, but was happy to do so. I am very satisfied."
1,PLEASE DONT BUY!!,Company needs to update their item description. This item and picture do not match the title. This item is in fact a regular shower curtain so please purchase elsewhere until they fix their problem.
1,Shipped Wrong Item - Also,"I should have listened to the other reviews - they also sent me the extra LONG, not the extra WIDE. To exchange I have to call a number, submit a form, wait for an email...LAME."
2,Not very good,"This was delivered on time, however, it already is rusting on the metal grommets (all of them) the liner it's self was the right size and seems to be well made. I am very disappointed however, I have only had it for a month and the rust on the grommets is bad."
1,Not as expected,The vinyl smell from this product is so heavy I threw it away after hanging it. This product was not what I was expecting as the quality of vinyl used was clearly very poor.
1,not heavy duty vinyl,"This curtain is the right size since I'm looking for something over 88"" long unfortunately its not heavy duty vinyl. I do not think it will hold up very long despite having metal grommets. The curtain that I am replacing is a much heavier vinyl and has lasted for years."
3,shower curtain,"The reason I ordered this curtain was for the length. Although the description says premium weight vinyl, I do not consider the weight of this curtain heavy duty. The length was fine but I would have expected the vinyl to be a heavier quality based on the description.I was pleased that the curtain holes are secured with metal grommets."
4,Just what I needed,"Our bathtub only has walls on 2 sides, so we needed a wider shower curtain to cover more space. This is the perfect width. The only problem I've found is that the magnets aren't very strong, so the shower curtain blows in while you're showering. But that happens with a lot of shower curtains so I'm just going with it."
2,Funny yet pitiful,"While I laughed, the author's chronic lack of sumo knowledge is equally laughable. Conjecture, speculation, and errors abound. You get the impression he himself thinks he could beat some of these guys. There are far better sumo books out there that prove just how strong these men really are. Search them on Amazon"
3,Too Long!!,"I just received these wires for my 2003 Focus Zetec 2.0 DOHC, and while they seem to be well engineered and well made, every single wire is 2-3"" longer than the Motorcrafts I replaced. I went ahead and installed them and even swapped down a size on one for a trimmer, more appropriate fit, but the install has twists and turns in it the sanitary OEM install would have never left the factory with.I guess since it is probably a universal set for many Ford 4 cylinders, Bosch decided to go with a ""one size fits all approach"". I don't see any performance issues from the added length, but every time I pop the hood, I'll be reminded about how lame Bosch was in making this decision...Hopefully, their performance and longevity will exceed the precision of their fit. 3 stars for clumsy fit."
2,Not enough diffusing power,"Really wanted this to work, but did not diffuse enough for my stove. The lowest simmer setting on my gas stove is too hot. I am constantly burning things on the smallest burner at the lowest setting. This plate did not help at all, food burned just the same."
1,Useless...,"Lasted just one use. Were attractive as burner covers, but chipped and flaked when exposed to heat. As another reviewer posted, would be a much better product in plain, uncoated cast iron."
2,Good product terrible shipping..,"When the product finaly arrived it was just what we needed. Good product!Unfortunately UPS is no good in Norway, when I tracked the shipment I could see it had arrived after two days to transit in Norway. And there it was stuck for a week.. I don't know what happend, but this confirms my theory of that there are no way I'll by products shipped to Norway with UPS...To bad I have to downrate a good product, because UPS don't do their job.."
5,Does the job.,I am using this on an electric stove burner under a terracotta tagine. It successfully softens and spreads the heat. It fits the burner correctly.
1,"Stinky ""Space Age Coating"". Prone to Warping.","The ""space age coating"" smelled very bad, then began flaking off all over everything and everyone it touched. We used a wire brush to remove the remaining coating.The diffuser warped badly after a few uses, developing a high spot in the center. We reshaped it with a heavy hammer."
5,RV Perfect,"We bought both the 6"" and 8"". It was impossible to turn the gas burners down in our Motor Home in order cook slowly or simmer. We used a diffuser for a long time until we discovered these. Wow! They are great! You can even stack them for even lower temps. They also retain heat for keeping food warm."
1,Paint melted first usage,"I was looking forward to a cleaner method of cooking on our electric stove, unfortunately the first time we tried it out, a burning smell came on very quickly and the painted started to melt and crack right off:[...]Needless to say, we're returning this immediately. Be careful using it!"
1,Shape does not work on my electric range,I was expecting a solid metal puck-shaped head-diffuser when I ordered this; it turns out that this is a hollow cup-shaped-on-one-side piece of useless metal that simply does not fit properly on my eletric rangetop. Complete waste of metal and money.
2,I returned it...,I was looking for a heat diffuser for my gas cook top and bought this one. I set it on my stove and it slid around on the grates. I didn't feel it was safe. I just ordered the Ilsa Cast Iron one from Amazon. Hopefully it works better.
3,Pretty good but not stout enough,"Have a propane stove with a couple of high-power burners and even at their lowest setting, this burner plate does not produce a steady, low simmer - simply not thick enough. Probably would work well with electric stove or try the Fox Run Heat Diffuser - available at Amazon. It seems to produce a good simmer on our propane gas stove."
3,8 inch burner plate,"I had hoped this would be thicker than it is, but it has helped reduceneed for higher heat on my electric stove and scorching of homemade soups."
3,OH NO!!! What they DON'T tell you about these burner plates...,"...is that because the metal used is so thick and solid, it takes about 3 times as long for your pots or pans to get as hot as they would normally when you are NOT using them!Which means that these plates are great if you are cooking something that requires delicate and well-distributed heat over a long period of time, like sauces or broths for example. However, for most normal everyday cooking, these burner plates will actually double or triple your total cooking time...argh!I will try to return them for a refund. I was looking something that would simply distribute heat more evenly and efficiently especially when using smaller pots and pans with which the naked gas flame would overlap too much, wasting a lot of heat. I just wish the product description and other reviews had pointed out the slow heating-up time of these plates, that would've saved me time and money."
5,Burner Plate,I enjoy using my burner plate . It is the best thing to use in the kitchen.Your food do not stick to the pot and it is good to cook any thing that you want to cook slowly. A must have for your kitchen.I brought my product from amazon.com
2,Performs as advertised!,"Purchased two 8"" burner plates after moving into an apartment with a finicky gas stove. I could not adjust the burners to achieve a consistent simmer for soups, oatmeal, and other liquid-based foods. By placing the burner plate over the flame I was able to adjust the temperature to just about any heat level I needed. The burner plates are of excellent quality and a good value. Even my omelets are cooking with less heat and more evenly. You won't be disappointed!"
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!!!!! I PURCHASED THIS FOR A WEDDING GIFT. WHEN THE COVERS WERE USED, THE METAL JUST STARTED TO CRUMBLE OFF THE BURNERS. THAT HAD TO BE THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN ON A NEW STOVE. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS WEDDING PRESENT!!! IT IS OVER 30 DAYS AND I CAN NOT GET MY MONEY BACK. THAT IS NOT RIGHT TO GET AWAY WITH SELLING DAMAGED PRODUCTS!!!!! AMAZON WILL NOT HELP WITH THIS PURCHASE.Nordic Ware 8 Inch Heat Tamer and Burner Plate"
1,Nordic Ware heat tamer burner heat diffuser,"Do not fit standard gas stove, shallow and way to light, won't be using it. Wasn't worth shipping back. Thrown away. Really needs 0 stars."
3,not for glass cooktop,"Do not purchase if you have a glass cooktop. These are raised for coil burners. Not a bad product, but for coil only."
1,Lousy Value!,"Purchased 2-6"" & 2-8"" plates on December 11, 2011. It is now 2 months later and the 8"" plates are starting to chip, i.e., small black flakes are beginning to peel and fall from the plates. The 8"" plates are used more, however, I expected them to be more durable. They also discolor easily. This is a poor quality product."
4,it works,"I bought the heat tamer for use with very low simmering such as oatmeal, rice, etc. I found that the lowest setting on my gas stove was too high and, particularly with the lid on, these tended to boil over, It works!!!!! I might have been better with a larger one but as I said, this works."
1,very unstatisfactory,"I bought one of these for my electric stove about 1 1/2 years ago. Kind of expensive for a piece of metal at the time, but it seemed to work OK for a while until I began noticing that my pots or pans did not set flat on the plate anymore. Sure enough, the plate became noticeably warped with a hump in the middle. It was after a year of usage and I didn't pursue a replacement or refund. In the meantime I found in the bottom of my cabinet a round steel plate we must have purchased 20-30 years ago. I have been using this old one under same conditions since with excellent results - no warping."
4,Did the job,"I bought this to use with a recently purchased tagine. It definitely accomplished its task, although it smelled a little bizarre on the burner. While I hope this will not be a regular occurrence, it is pretty useful"
4,haunting...clever...powerhouse rock at its best!,"It's probably not the amazing guitar riffs and lyrics that grab your attention when you hear the Laura Shawen Band. More than likely it is Laura's intense vocal style, her deep vibratto is hard to match and it helps her bring depth to songs like ""Sweet"" and ""Burn"". The songs on this album are incredible and I can only imagine how they must sound live. Songs like ""Shakespeare's Lover"" are pure classic rock while ""Burn"" and ""Ugly Girl"" are cutting-edge alternative. This is definatly worth checking out!!!"
5,love it,The service was great! package arrived on time. The game plays well and works like brand new. will order again.
2,bad action and controls,"this game will please fans of the show but for everyone else will want to avoid it and play other good platformers like Mario, Sonic or castlevania. There are better games out ther than this. If you want a fun platformer, look for mario or sonic or the classic nes series. Buy those instead"
4,cool show & Game,I watch this show on nickelodeon. Its a really good show even my brother loves it. Timmys favorite superhero has been kidnapped by the brons kneecap. there are 5 worlds with 4 stages each.
4,"Great way to connect your tube, and great for small kids","I bought this because my new boat did not have tube/ski hook ups, unless I wanted to jump in the water every time to hook it up, plus they were close to the props. I bought this to hook the tube to my port/starboard cleets. This worked very well for what I needed. But I also found another advantage (which could also be a disadvantage for some). With the pully system, it keeps tyhe tube in the center of the boat regardless of how you turn the boat. This is great if you have small children on the tube and dont want them to jump the wake. If you want the action of jumping the wake, then you really need to turn the boat sharply. you can just go without the pully if you want a crazier ride."
3,Good Product - Clips too Small,"I ""ditto"" an earlier post - the product looks like a winner, but the clips are too small to attach to my pontoon. I would think these sorts of things are pretty uniform across the industry, so I'm guessing that a lot of people will have the same problem.Close but no cigar."
2,Good quality but didn't work on my boat,"I have an outboard MasterCraft and wanted to attach the tube to the back of the boat so people can sit in the back seat and not have to avoid the rope. This harness is built very well but didn't work on my boat because the hooks on the back are too low. I guess. If it works on your boat you will be happy, if not, send it back."
2,Clips too small,Everything is great except the clips are too small and won't attach to the boat. Now I have to figure out a way to splice larger clips (on my dime) or figure out how to tie the bridle to the boat which defeats the whole purpose.
4,Great asset on my recent trip,"Although the book favors the Beijing style pronunciation, the Chinese characters within are worth their weight in jade. I frequently pointed at more difficult characters. Coupled with a few phrases I'd picked up from the beginning of the book, I got around China really well.Missing was a section on how to properly tell off street peddlers and other nuisances. I would have loved a dialogue page with the following exchange:""Would you like a 'Rolex' watch?""""No. Go away and never pester me again you troglodyte!""Even with the above-mentioned shortcoming, I'd take this book back with me to China if I ever get the chance to return there. Take this with you and keep it very handy. I compared it to the newest Lonely Planet guide and this one is superior."
4,Mandarin guide book,"I found the book to be a great pocket size for taking with me without having to carry it in my hands. The book has a nice amount of words for translation, however it would be nice if it had a few more short common phrases such as: ice cream, or cut the grass, etc."
3,ITS OK,As with most of these books the print is small. There needs to be more English to PinYin translation of both words and phrases.
1,bad experience,Please don't buy this battery. Price is so good but I did not have a chance to use it. I can't even take on picture by using this battery. Battery has no power and can not be recharged.
1,Dont buy this !,"I could make a better speaker with paper ! I cant understand how they get away with selling this cheap, garbage so called speakers !!!!"
1,"Horrible sound, You get what you pay for.",Hooked these speakers up in My Chevrolet Express Van in rear. It's a factory stereo that didn't have rear speakers. These are flat out awful... Got my monies worth? No.
1,Disappointed,Within a few weeks one speaker malfunctioned and was reduced to a distant high pitched static-filled buzz. Not worth the money.
3,Pyramid 2060 box speaker,Speakers seem well made and sound is good. The only shortfall are the brackets are flimsy plastic. I already know since they are mounted on a golf cart that I will have to fabricate metal brackets soon.
2,Pyramid speaker system,"The old saying, ""You get what you pay for.."", certainly applies here..One of the speakers didn't last a week! 300 watts?? Just hooked them up to a regular car radio.. But, the enclosures are what I really wanted anyway.. So, I really can't complain! :)"
3,Too much information.,"This book was purchased in order to read the material taught in my education. It covers CLS Chemitry thoroughly however, I never opened it when studying for my ASCP Board exam and I did very well on it."
4,Hot Hot Hot,Where did this dude come from? Texas i hear. this stuff just lets you know Nelly and Eminem arent the only talent out. I HAVE TO LET MY BOYS HEAR THIS TOO! Catch me at the hotel is hard and knight rider is well his track. Hot! wheres the stores with this in and the radio play?
5,GREAT TOY,"THIS IS A GREAT TOY. MY KIDS GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS, IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS TO DO WITH THE PLAYDOH THEY LOVED IT"
4,Not the full score,"I have been collecting Classical films music for more than ten years. I have two versions of the Ten Commandments on CD, including this one that I bought years ago at a reasonable price not at such an exorbitant price. Apparently, a few years ago, Paramount issued a two-disc version which looks like the full version of the music, but there is no real trace of it. I have found it because there are track listings of that in [...], but where is the CD???"
3,"It works, i just wish it were taller","It works, i just wish it were taller since the top tends to hit some of my food when microwaving certain foods. but overall i am happy with the build quality"
4,Nordic Ware Microwave Plate Cover,I am so pleased with this product. This is the 2nd one I have had and I would recommend to anyone. I should have gotten 2 and given one to my daughter. I certainly have enjoyed mine but need to remember that it doesn't go in the dishwasher. The 1st one lasted years even with me doing that to it...putting in the d'washer. Best of luck to all future purchasers of this item.
5,Support for micro-go-round,"Found this product to be a valuable addition for supporting microwave cooking. Easy to use, aids in final microwave results, and elemenates other covering ulternatives."
4,Works well.,"I never thought to get a plate cover, had always just used paper towels, but recently was at a friend's house and notice they had one. I thought it was a great idea, would avoid sputters and splats in the microwave, so got one. I truthfully haven't used it yet, but I feel it will be worth having."
4,Keeps the microwave clean,"This stops all the splattering of the inside of the microwave. However, don't stick your finger in the hole on top to remove it from your plate. You will steam your finger."
5,Great Product,I love the harder plastic because it is easier to use and not so hard to handle along with washability.
1,plate cover,I was not happy with the cover it worked good for one cooking and by the third cooking of bacon the cover totaly melted down to a flat gloob of plastic in my bacon
2,nordic ware 11 inch micro plate cover,I wanted a cover that is eleven inches in diameter. I measured the one you sent me and it was only ten inches. I am unhappy.
4,Nordic Ware Microwave plate cover is a smart purchase.,"I like the Nordic Ware Microwave plate cover a lot better than another plate cover I've had for several years now. The NW plate cover is 11 inches which allows it to sit right on the edge of most plates (ceramic and paper) without touching your food when it revolves inside the microwave. It also has a high enough top to allow for use with bowls. The previous cover I owned had a stupid ""dip"" in it's top that made it inconvenient to use for bowls of soups and the like. The NW cover's design eliminates this problem. Also, it's very easy to clean and doesn't get ""scarred"" by the hot foods that marred the finish on my older cover. I'm happy with this microwave plate cover."
5,microwave plate cover,"Got this on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. I wished I had it sooner. It covers up to a large 10 inch plate, and has saved me countless trips to get wrap or foil to cover a dish so the contents don't splatter. It cleans up quickly and I just put it inside the microwave until the next time I need it."
3,"Ok, but could be better","Works great but... The microwave cover gets washed often and it's hard to clean the edges. The vent holes were not smoothed down so hand washing roughs up the sponge.Also, the middle of the cover is too low. It touches the food. Not great for soups. The handle should be domed up instead of down."
5,Great for Keeping Microwaves Clean,The last cover I had was not nearly as well constructed and yet it lasted for a dozen years. This cover is perfect and will probably see me through til my death bed. Covering the food makes microwave cleaning so much easier.
4,Nice,"It's very good. Durable, easy to clean, protects from splatter. Everything that I expected. However, the hole in the top is fairly large and splatters have gone through the top. It would be better if there were smaller air holes around the sides or something."
2,Does not fit 11 inch plates,"The manufacturer states this cover will work on 11 inch plates. It only fits plates 10 1/4 inches in diameter. Otherwise, it seems to be made well enough of a hard plastic material. If it is seated correctly on a plate, it is slightly less than 2 1/4 inches tall. This may be a little low for some foods."
1,Steam Burns,"Got this and it worked. We got a new microwave that works better and gets food hot fast the first time.The vent is also where you pick up this cover, we have gotten steam burns as a result. We usually wait 1-2 minutes and still got steam burns. The heat finally cracked this. Next time I will find one has more than one vent in the center.Nice while it lasted."
3,"works okay, but would prefer something else","Bought this at Wal-mart and have used it for less than a year. It covers plates nicely; if I'm using a square casserole dish, I invert the cover and it works fine. I haven't had an issue with it fitting our microwave, but I think we have at least 1.0 c.f. capacity.I'm looking for a new one, though, because this has cracked in three long jags from vent hole to edges (roughly into thirds). If it's due to dishwasher heat, they shouldn't advertise it as dishwasher safe. I don't know why it cracked, but I'd rather have a solid construction cover.This works decently, and is better than nothing; it still keeps our microwave clean despite the long cracks."
1,"Doesn't last, less expensive wal-mart options hold up much much better.",This item begins warping in the first week and it's just down hill from there. Have had much better luck with covers I've bought for less money elsewhere. Interestingly enough there are thinner materials that hold up much better than this item did.
4,Keeps microwave clean and food heats uniformly,We bought this cover to eliminate the need to use plastic wrap when re-heating food in the microwave. It works great. Only complaint is that it is bulky. Would be great if they had a lower profile model.
4,wrong size,"We have a earlier model and it works great on 10.25"" plates, I have no idea on what size it was called. Mom got some new plates and they are bigger 10 5/8"" and our older model no longer fit, if we set it on perfect it will stay on, other wise it just falls off. This 11"" cover may be a bit larger but does not fit the way it is suppose to. Gave it away at Christmas."
4,I wish it was taller,I have a few brands of microwave cooking covers. They all work well enough. My only complaint about all of them: I've got taller bowls they do not work for because these covers are not tall enough. I end up needing something to put them on to lift them higher above a tall soup bowl.
1,It broke,"I own this microwave cover but I am currently shopping for a new one since this one has broken. I used it maybe 2-3 months, microwaving something 2-3 times a week, before a huge crack splintered from the middle hole. I am not entirely sure how it happened, maybe it got too hot or was in use in the microwave for too many minutes at one time.Another issue I had is that it wasn't very deep, if I was reheating something in a bowl the top of the bowl was flush with the top of the cover and the cover did not reach to bottom of the microwave. Many times I had a full bowl of pasta or such and it was squished to the top of the cover creating more of a mess on the cover than just regular splatter."
5,I should have had these years ago!,"I purchased this because it looked like an interesting concept and the price was right. This was a very well made purchase. It fights over all of my plates. It prevents any platter in my microwave, and I no longer need to use paper towels when microwaving foods."
1,melted???,"This item is advertised as being able to withstand heat up to 450 degrees. I accidentally left it in the microwave and used convection at 350 degrees. The cover had completely melted and coated the bottom of my microwave with melted plastic. I'll probably spend 2 hours chiselling out the plastic.I'm upset that I lost money on this product, but moreso that it should not have happened had their marketting been true. I'm thinking about mailing the hunks of plastic to them to try and get a replacement."
1,IT MELTS,"This plate cover cannot withstand the heat of a microwave. Eventually, exposed to high temperature over a few minutes, as in cooking a potato, it will warp. Also, it's too shallow (two inches tall) to accommodate non-flat, raised dishes. Buy either a higher plate cover or one made of glass or other heat resistant material like porcelain. This plate cover is made of plastic. It's not made of glass. Also, at 11 inches in diameter, it is too small for many plates."
2,Broke after four months of use,"When I first started using it, I thought it was odd that it started to have little cracks right away. Then I noticed little compressions after heating (and I don't overheat my food). Four months later, it is completely broken. Would not recommend this at all."
5,Perfect,"Unlike other microwave covers, this one is actually wide enough to fit around my big plates. I like that the top is flat, so I can stack something else on top if I want to cook two things at once, or cover the vent. It's see-through too!"
2,"This one cracked, melted","Used it for a couple of months. We bought a microwave/convection oven at the same time. I mistakenly set the oven at 325F using the convection/microwave mix. Don't do that. The cover got very soft. Weeks later, I dropped it on the kitchen floor. It broke. I threw it out. Might be a good cover. I would avoid dropping or overheating it!"
2,Microwave cover,"When the item arrived it had a smudge that would not wash out. Also, found the same cover with a plate for frying bacon for less so I sent the item back."
2,thought it was bigger and more softer,I replaced my old one as i burned it and orded this but it hard plastic and the soft plastic ones are better also it is not as high as my old on so when i cover it touches with the top of my food and i have to keep cleaning it. I thought this one was the biggest one on Amazon as i have big plates but its smaller then my old one so it does not fit in my plates well. Can be machine washed with heat.
4,Nordic Ware 65004 11-Inch Microwave Plate Cover,"This item is very sturdy and fits over a dinner plate nicely in the microwave. I already had one (another brand) that I have had for years, so this one is nice for an extra to have on hand. It should last as it is well made."
1,Melted,"Used it to cover slightly greasy food. When the fat from the food splashed onto the cover, it melted in those spots. I can still use it, but it looks terrible."
4,Good but not tall enough,"I had another microwave plate cover that cracked, so I bought this to replace it. It works fine, except for the fact that it's not tall enough. If I had given this some thought before I bought it, I probably would've bought a different one that was taller. Having said that, when I do use it, it does keep foods from splattering in the microwave."
5,good bye spatters,Great way to warm leftovers in microware and a great way to protect food agains little flying critters
5,Works great!,I use this almost every time I microwave now. Much better than wax paper and easy to wipe down & clean.
4,"Works great, has a 3-4 year life.",Great micro cover - better quality than the ones you can get at bed bath and beyond. They tend to crack after prolonged use (3-4 years) - but well worth it!
5,AWESOME!,"A must for every Microwave! Keeps it a lot cleaner! We even got one for the office microwave! Washes up easy, or drop it in the dish washer!"
1,Poor design,It would be a nice cover if it didn't have the hole in the middle of the top. You have to cover the hole with a paper towel to keep food from splattering through it and onto the roof of the microwave.There are better covers out there that don't have a hole in the top (which defeats the purpose of the cover); buy one of them instead.
4,"Ok, but too shallow","This works well, but anything very tall does not fit under this lid. I think I should have shopped for this in a grocery or kitchen store before buying this with my microwave."
3,"Excellent, but limited life","I read all the reviews and bought this cover, about a year ago. It is fabulous! Works as advertised and the microwave food stayed moist instead of getting dried out. The center hole was a little rough so I used some sandpaper on it to smooth it out. However, in the last couple of weeks the entire cover is filled with cracks and splits. For the cover itself, 5 stars - for the limited life 1 star. I am buying a second one now."
1,Need more improvement in design and manufacturing,"I purchased this item based on the reviews. I received mine a few days ago and was instantly disappointed based on a number of things.1. It's too short. Why do most manufacturers make microwave covers like these? What happens with other tallers container like soup bowls or plates with big items like chicken? The cover will touch the food.2. Why is the cover tinted? The microwave door is already tinted so the extra tinting renders your view of the items inside the cover close to nill. Clear or frosted microwave covers are better.3. The manufacturing quality is poor. I got the product full of scratches and cracks all over. There was even one long scratch on one side. The plastic sides was not smooth.Overall, it is not a good product and I would advise looking for something else much taller in height and with better manufacturing quality."
1,It Melts,"I bought this to replace a couple of these covers I have had for about 5 years. The older ones had served me wonderfully. Same brand, same model. The old ones I had bought at a local Walmart.This new one must have had a change in the plastic recipe. After about ten days of use (one time daily) the top is all wavy and distorted. The inside is beginning to pit and cloud. It is beginning to melt! I wonder what has fallen into my food!?"
5,Best Cover Ever,This is a sturdy food cover for the microwave & after all the years I have used it-I wouldn't do without it.I even got my daughter one as she loved mine.'Very well made-ENJOY as I have!
2,Not tall enough,"Although the diameter is sufficient, I found it does not sit high enough and touches the food on the plate on most uses. I would prefer a taller unit."
2,Nordic Ware 65004 11-Inch Microwave Plate Cover,"I don't think the plate cover works very well. I tried heating up spaghetti for 4 minutes at high (usually no feat for saran wrap), but my spaghetti wasn't heated."
2,I wouldn't recommend,I didn't realize from the picture that all there was on top was a hole. So you can get a nice steam scalding lifting this cover off hot microwave food. If that seems extreme it is just a really tacky design to have no handle or indents (like other versions of this idea).
2,does not stand up to heat,The center of the cover melted in the microwave. It now has a dent in it. I do not recommend it.
5,Use it everyday,This is so much handier than getting out plastic wrap to keep food from splattering in the microwave. It fits perfectly with Nordic Ware round bacon grill.
4,Nordic Ware 65004 11-Inch Microwave Plate Cover,The Nordic Ware 65004 11-Inch Microwave Plate Cover is nice. The only thing is you have to watch your fingers when you are take the cover off of your food. You can burn your fingers from the steam of the food if you put your finger into the open hole on top of the cover when you are trying to remove the cover from the food. It's best to lift up the cover on both sides of the cover and (warning) do not try to remove cover by sticking your finger into the hole of the cover when your food has finish cooking. Easy to clean.
2,Melted,I liked the look of this cover and because i was renovating my kitchen I wanted a new look. I gave this product 2 stars because it stopped splatter. But it began to melt after the second use. I am going to use my old one until I can find a replacement.
4,Almost as good as a paper plate,Concept is great...maybe it works but the Microwave Turntable stops when I add the plate cover. Just wait until I'm asked to review that item! New to me house with older KitchenAid microwave...no built in turntable.
1,This is not a glass microwave cover.,I was looking for a glass microwave cover to avoid BPA on plastics and this came up in the Amazon search. It looked like glass as well. I'm so disappointed. I'll keep it for now but will keep looking.
2,A hole on top,"Very disappointed to discover the cover has an open hole on top, with no way of completely covering."
3,Material quality is not the best,Does the job--but the plastic is a bit stiff. Mine has warped and cracked. There must be a better material for this type of item.
5,Great microwave cover,Love this mirowave cover - keeps the microwave clean. Only caution: don't put close to a hot stove - cover melts rather rapidly!
5,Great product; works as described!,"I use this product on a weekly basis and it does what it is advertised to do.No longer am I cleaning up messes of stuff that ""blow up"" in the microwave because they were too tightly covered. By using this cover as instructed, there is enough room for air and gas and whatnot to get out (or circulate), therefore preventing food from blowing up and making a mess all over the microwave.Very easy to clean and take care of. Durable."
4,"Liked it so much, I have already given one as a gift","I only got this ~3 months ago, but I like it (and not having to clean the microwave) so much that I have already purchased another for a gift. It fits on top of our large dinner plates and bowls and goes in the dishwasher every week or two."
4,Microwave Plate Cover,"The only down fall to this product I've found using it, is that the hole on top is a little bigger than it should be, because it lets food come out while it's heating up in the microwave. Art Shields"
3,Plate Cover,"We've had this plate cover for a few weeks. We bought it to replace the Pampered Chef cover we had been using for years. The old one was more pliable; this one is a very hard plastic. I'm not sure how long it will last before it cracks.Our old cover was a little bigger and fit over the plate better. This one fits the plate, but barely.I would still buy it."
4,Just what I needed,I needed a new one & didn't feel like going to the store....just happened to come across this item as I was making another purchase. It was $7 & change. This cover is plastic & well made.
4,Works for me,"I purchased a microwave plate cover 20 years ago. It was perfect, but finally cracked up and needed to be replaced this year. I purchased this Nordic Ware Microwave Plate Cover and am satisfied. My 20 year old plate cover had a larger circumference than my new one. This new one may be smaller, but seems sturdier. Let's see if it lasts 20 years."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY!,"I bought this item after seeing the 78 reviews, far more positive than negative. Consider this before you make this purchase:The height of this cover is too low for me. When warming a plate or in particular a soup, the contents either touch the middle of the cover and ooze out the top or splatter all over the inside middle. It could have been a great product if it was about three inches taller, but it fails miserably as is."
1,"Nice idea, but a critical flaw","As mentioned by another reviewer, this item has a critical flaw: it's just too short. It can't be used with bowls over a few inches tall, and for small plates with a small pile of food, the cover is touching the food. This is especially troublesome when the cover has been used to prevent splatters ... dried splattered food on the inside of the cover is happily mingling with the food on your plate.Other than that, it does its job well and prevents splatters. But I simply don't have enough instances where I can use it. Ideally, to be more versatile, the cover should be at least twice it's current height, which is why I'm continuing my search."
2,Microwave Plate Cover appears to be USED!,"I just received the Nordic Ware Microwave Plate Cover, and it appears to have been used and returned. The center hole is a bit misshapen and ""melted"" looking. Very disappointing. Yes, I should return it (so it can be sent out again to someone else?)...but it's not worth the hassle."
5,Perfect!,"My microwave stopped spinning, so the food was warmed unevenly. I searched for this plastic cover that I remembered having years ago before the microwaves spun around the dish. This was exactly what I was looking for, it works great! I bought 2- one as a spare! Highly recommend."
3,"nothing special, a nice plastic cover","... in retrospect, it's just another piece of plastic. OK, it's a little stronger plastic than most plasticware and the smokey gray color nicely hides the splatters, preventing stain as well. But lately ...I've been seeing LOTS of similar plastic, microwave plate covers for [less money]. So if you care that much about your microwave plate cover being top-of-the-line, then hey - GO FOR IT! If you're like me, who rather spend the extra buck or two on cookware or china itself, then go for another brand, a made in Taiwan/ China version! One more thing - the HOLE in the middle appears to be unfinished, you can almost feel the rough sawing done to make the hole, seems the edge should have been melted or something so it would smooth out making it easier for your finger to grab."
2,Not as big as you think,"When the description says that it fits ""over an 11 inch plate"", I expect it to be over 11 inches in diameter. It is just 11 inches in its outside diameter, more like 9-3/8 inch inside diameter. It sits ""on"" my 11 inch dinner plates, not ""over"" them. Rather disappointed. Now I have to decide if I want to go thru the hassle of sending it back or just look for a larger one that will fit over my 11 inch dinner plates. I know, ""on"" or ""over"", it's a technicality, but I'm disappointed."
5,"Like everyone else, I think this is a great cookbook!","This was one of the first cookbooks my wife and I purchased when we got married. It is one of the best basic cookbooks I've seen. Compared to some of the other cookbooks we have, Easy Basics recipes are usually simpler and better described. But they haven't been simplified to the point that the flavor of the dishes are compromised. The binding on our copy has been broken for years, we use it so much. Shame on Sunset for discontinuing this one!"
5,The ONE I would keep,"....if I had to pare down my huge collection to only one cookbook. I bought this in 1983 and it is the most useful reference I have. I still use it at least once a week, and I even sent it to my son in Greece while he was a student for 6 months in Athens. Strictly on loan! Now that I have found a source for used copies of this out-of-print title I will order a couple for two of our adult kids. It's the cook's equivalent of the best Singer sewing books!"
4,Great No-fail recipes,"I was given this book approx. 25 years ago and haven't experienced any failures. I still refer to it for some basic recipes.Not being able to find it locally, I ordered it from Amazon for my son who has left home.It would have to be the best all-rounder cookbook with great recipes for each area of cooking you want to explore.It has very clear instructions using easily accessible ingredients."
3,A decent overview,"This is a decent overview but is missing some great tracks like ""Just For You"" from Blurred Crusade. I think the hits were not necessarily the greatest stuff the Church had to offer. Even the flip-side of Metropolis, ""Monday Morning,"" was to me a lot more enjoyable than several of their hits.Some of the tracks here are edited down to shorter versions, which is actually a benefit in most cases, because one of the Church's faults is to drag their songs on much too long. When 2:30-3:00 minutes would suffice, the Church stretch a lot of songs out to 4:00-6:00.The Church's best album by far is their debut ""Of Skins And Heart,"" and sadly that one isn't even available at Amazon. That album had none of the overindulgence and sometimes plodding, overlong songs of the later years. All crisp, relatively short, unadorned '60s-influenced pop, more direct and tight than anything else they ever recorded."
5,very nice,"I'm not an expert on The Church--I've always liked the song ""Under the Milky Way"", but didn't know their other songs. After listening to a few of the tracks on this web page, I decided to buy it.I'm very happy with it. All the songs are good--there isn't any ""filler"". Good vocals, good guitar, and good melodies and song writing. If you like the sound of ""Under the Milky Way"", you'll like the rest of this collection."
5,Get a Grip With Slik,"For the last thirty years I have been engaged as a professional fine art and commercial photographer. Over the years, I have bought every expensive ball socket tripod head. Most of these $100 to $300 dollar marvels of the latest technology were slow, clumsy, awkward, and none of them had truly positive locks on the camera position.Then, along comes the Slik Digital Grip Trigger. It beats them all, hands down, in every regard. It is truly ""slick"", fast, and locks the camera in a rock solid hold in any position you put it in. This grip really is a marvel of quintessential product design. Keep your mind on your work, not on your sagging camera. Get yourself a Slik grip today."
1,Not what it looks like,"I wanted some bling for my little black pug and I LOVE leopard. I knew i was taking a chance on this one but it looked so cute on I figured why not? Well I received my item and it looks nothing like the product pictured. The ring was totally tarnished, the leopard was gross and old raggy looking and it is about 1/2 the size of what is pictured. I knew it was going to be about 3/4 inch but i was just disappointed with this purchase. Not only did I have to pay for the shipping for it to reach me... now I have to pay to return it. No return shipping labels are provided through this vendor so beware. Dang. I was really hoping this would be perfect but its totally ugly. don't buy it."
1,a real disappointment,"this book begins with a riveting account of the Central America and its demise; about a quarter of the book. The book then founders miserably in an undiscriminating tide of details and people who turn out to be UNrelated to the recovery attempt! By the time we get to the excavation of the gold, (the very last chapters) i felt as if the book had sunk to the depths of the ocean along with the Central America.i'm a very disappointed that so few books are edited carefully these days. this book holds more potential than it lived up to."
1,One word - snoooozzzze,"Is this supposed to be the biography of a ""mad"" scientist or the story of a treasure hunt? I kept waiting for the good stuff, but it never came. Read this in bed in the evening and it certainly didn't keep me awake."
3,Great real-life tale hampered by sometimes-plodding writing.,"All-in-all, a book worth reading. Slow start, sometimes plodding writing, but a great tale overall. Could even make a great movie, with great special effects."
3,Not as good as expected.,"My husband loves non-fiction. This was recommended to him. He was bored because it took 75 pages just to sink the ship and too much was written about Thompson. When he got to the heart of the book, he enjoyed it more. I wish I would have known how pedantic parts of the book were although it was very informative."
3,Maybe Too Golden -,"The descriptions of the shipwreck are truly first class, especially the earlier chapters. If you've been in a storm at sea, you will know what I mean. As an attorney I found the passages about the legal tangles and admiralty law, protecting the site from freeloaders and poachers, and later protecting the right to the treasure, quite fascinating. The technical details became tedious, but so was the search. I missed not seeing any diagrams or pictures of the underwater search and retrieve mechanisms. Kinder puts the engineering genius/expedition leader Tommy Thompson on a very high pedestal. I find now on Google that Thompson today is nowhere to be found, disappeared without paying his investors a penny (dare I say not one Golden Eagle) leaving one to wonder more how the author could have so misjudged the character of the man he wrote about so carefully than how his financially savvy investors could have been so deceived."
5,This is a great book !,"A true story, this book reads like a good tech-thriller novel. Easily one of the better books I've read in a long time. I highly recommend to anyone, but especially to those out there like me that love tech-adventure fiction."
4,What did they find???,"This book is every bit as gripping and expertly written as its reviews claim, even if one thought one was immune to shipwreck stories after TITANIC fever. However, it has one glaring flaw. After waiting for hundreds of pages, never do we get but a few glimpses of what was actually found in or around the wreck, other than loving description of the gold, which, let's face it, was more of interest to the investors in the salvaging than to us. Was this possibly for obscure issues of legally-oriented confidentiality, as the preface hints? If so, one cannot help but wonder why this hasn't been an issue with TITANIC. Unfortunately, I felt let down by this book on this score despite what a riproaring tale it certainly is; I STILL wonder what survived the decades under the sea."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Well there I was on honeymoon in Mauritius. The country is beautiful. I was laying on the beach soaking up the sun when I thought to myself, I need a book to read. I popped into the hotels shop and the first book I saw was Ship of Gold by Gary Kinder. Being a diver and having written a published book myself on UK wrecks, I thought I would give it a go. I read the book cover to cover in 3 days. (530 pages and I was on honeymoon!)Absolutely superb story, extremely well written. Was there a camera crew on board to film the discovery?Top marks to Kinder on the way he jumps from 1857 to the 1980's and then back again. Not a dull page in the book.If you like adventure books, historical maritime disasters and a thrilling ending, order this book now.cheers"
3,Interesting read but overall disappointing,"This book started out fantastically, with the account of Captain Herndon's ship and the tragedy those aboard went through. However, the next 500 pages or so were a sometimes excruciatingly painful read on everything I *didn't* want to know about Tommy Thompson. It was so bad at times I wondered whether the author gets down on bended knee when talking to Thompson. While I realize there were trade secrets to be preserved in this highly competitive field, I really felt that the author went to ridiculous lengths to cover them up in the book. Finally, the lack of pictures and illustrations is absolutely inexcusable. This book easily could have had 200 pages (mostly of Thompson-worship)trimmed without a loss."
3,Too Much Depth In The Deep Blue Sea,"With the weight of an anchor Gary Kinder sinks us into the depths of detail with only glimpses of the deep blue and shiney gold. Granted, Harvey Thompson probably micromanaged the prose in the same manner as he did the discovery project. Still, how many different doomed customer quotes did we need? How many Tommy Thompson phone calls did we need to know about? How many search lines did we need to navigate. If Kinder had cut the ballasts by 20%, this book would float. Sorry mates! You'll find it difficult to breath before the first search ship leaves port. While it gets exciting at that point, many readers will bobbing face down before the coins begin to jingle."
3,References?,"I am really enjoying this book but why are there no references or sources. There are quotes all over the place and the protagonists did an excellent job of researching but where is the proof? What publisher puts out a non-fiction book without sources? This is just so not okay. Still reading the book which was recommended to me by another teacher but the lack of sources is getting under my craw. This is unacceptable especially in this day and age when opinion turns up as fact on the internet. Otherwise, a good story."
4,Pretty good,"This is the second book in as many years that was ""not my type"" and yet I enjoyed both immensely (the other being Into Thin Air). The research was thorough (not actually done by the author) and it read like an adventure story. At times one longed for a bit more editing, but those somewhat tedious details are a reminder that this is real life and not a concocted adventure. Real life is also about getting financing, having things go wrong, people getting annoyed with each other, etc. Nice job."
3,Good Story But Not That Objective,"Kinder writes a solid description of the Central America and the huge effort undertaken to recover its gold. Unforunately, Tommy Thompson's quirky personality and boundless dedication to the project seem to be ""gilded"", and the book would have been enhanced by including more of his mistakes. For instance, one summer the search is started 2 1/2 months late. The blame is placed on a supplier, not on Tommy who micromanaged every other aspect of the project. As a follow up, in 11/98 some of the investors were trying to wrest control of the project from Tommy because of some difficulties they had with him. All in all a nice summer read. It would be neat to have a coin when they are sold to the public."
5,A splendid drama and adventure of the sea and burried treasu,"For those who love sea adventures and burried treasure, this is a must read. The sinking of the Central America makes the Titanic disaster seem tame. A great book for summer reading or any time. I wish there had been more pictures of the recovered treasure but the superb narrative and descriptive paragraphs make ones imagination run wild! This year's ""The Perfect Storm""."
2,Fails to deliver,"This book seems like it should have it all: a dramatic tale of a ship sinking in a storm, sunken treasure, pushing the technological envelope, extensive research and legal battles. And the story of the sinking of the SS Central America is pretty gripping reading. But in the end, it just fails to deliver on that promise. Much of the book felt like the author was saying ""well, I've done all this research, so I ought to put it in somewhere"". For much of the book, I found myself reading a quarter of the page and skipping to the next page, hoping the story would move on. In the end, I found it a book that I slogged through, not one that pulled me along with the story. I won't be reading it again."
2,Wheww! What stinks?,"A good story that's poorly written: You can skim the first three quarters where he tells you everything 2-3x. Is there a test at the end? Richard Preston, please rewrite"
1,Historically interesting treasure story,"This nonfiction treasure-hunting tale is at times extemely interesting and entralling, particularly the historical recreation of the diasaster that befell the Central America, but drags interminably through the parts dealing with the extraordinarily uninteresting character biographical development of the treasure hunter(s). More and more, as one reads, one could hardly care who the treasure hunters are. As the treasure unfolds and is recovered, one waits hopelessly for real details and historical perspective on the discoveries, and what one gets are how the team leader has micro-managed the project on this or that irrlevant undersea photo opportunity. Becase this book loses its way from the history and treasure after an awasome start along those lines, it became a trmendous disappintment. One hopes that someone will write a follow-up that completes the story in a more satisfying way."
4,"Suspense, excitement, and real!","The best part was the story of the sinking, followed by the discovery story. The boring part was Tommy Thompson's life story. The publisher's lack of editing was pretty glaring on occasion. And some photographs would have been nice. I'm sure there's at least one of Captain Herndon in the Herndon, Virginia city history. Even so, this is a very good book, made all the better because it really happened. I didn't honestly care about what Thompson actually salvaged from the wreak, but the story of the archeological work was fascinating. Perhaps a future update will include the final disposition of salvaged gold or whatever, not that it takes away from a good book. This one's definitely a keeper."
2,"With a little editing, this could be a great read","While I enjoyed this book, it was too drawn out and could have benefitted from some editing. There is a compelling story here, but you have to dig through loads of unnecessary personal details to get to it. The technical details of the project were fascinating, but the excrutiatingly detailed background on Tommy's life and other personal details were too much for me. When I finally did get to the good parts, however, I was completely engrossed."
5,Fantastic Nonfiction,"When the Central America sank in 1857 she took 21 tons of gold and more than 400 souls to the bottom of the sea, including one of my ancestors. Kinder's incredible book weaves the tale of the shipwreck together with the story of the thrilling recovery more than 130 years later.Ship of Gold is a fantastic book from historic and scientific perspectives. If you read this book, you will gain new insights about the Gold Rush and 19th-century sea travel; better yet, you will be amazed by the technological and biological advancements which were a direct consequence of Tommy Thompson's recovery.I read Ship of Gold to fill in the details of an old family legend. I was pleased to discover a truly amazing work of nonfiction."
5,Would recommend this book.,Superb Book. It's hard to imagine how many obstacles they had to overcome to recover the treasure. Kinder did a fantastic job of presenting the technical aspects of the operation along with the human side of the operation. The technical details involved in the operation were unbelievable. Couldn't put it down.
4,A wonderful story well told.,"Two compelling stories --the sinking of the Central American and the search for and recovery of its treasure. Tommy Thompson is an American original, and the author does a wonderful job helping us understand him and his quest."
4,Perfect fit,"Bought one of these for my '97 SL2. All the appropriate hardware was included, and the fit was just like the original. Been in use now for most of a year. It should also fit in any 1st or 2nd generation Saturn, on both available engines.Occasionally, after long freeway trips in hot weather at high speed, it will seem to crank a bit weakly. This is probably unavoidable, due to the unfortunate location of the exhaust pipe. I do not think it's any problem with this particular starter, just due to the heat from the exhaust, and it does not keep the starter from working.I would recommend this starter to anyone."
5,"Stimulating, Entertaining","I don't usually read mysteries but something about this book drew me in. And I'm awfully glad it did, too. I found the characters utterly fascinating and the plot entirely involving. At no time did any character come across as a cardboard cut-out stereotype, as often happens in historical fiction. The author also has a firm grasp on his subject, but at no time does the research erode the story. I recommend this most entertaining novel to anyone, whether that person be a mystery fan or just someone who likes fantastic fiction."
2,Interesting Blenheim setting with 21st century dialogue,"The plot is interesting. The setting is interesting. The characters were not remotely interesting or the dialogue. I doubt very much if some unknown ""architect"" is going to spend the weekend in the country with the Duke and Duchess. I doubt the Duke runs around the castle chasing his guests. Silly story."
3,NOS bottle heater,"installing this is kinda a pain and the thermostat is ghetto , I'd look into another model if I was looking for another"
1,not the right book,The book being offered here is not the book of short stories. It is the teachers guide to the book that actually contains the stories. The book I tried to purchase with the same title has over 1400 pages of stories. The book they are selling here has 177 pages of notes on those stories. Hopefully this will keep someone from making the same mistake I did.
2,Didn't stop my dog,I have a collie mix and he just sniffed the repell and went on with his business. Maybe it would work for smaller dogs or cats.
5,Fantastic Fix,"Theis granular product sprinkles easily, smells somewhat of mint and keept the unwanted animals away from where it was put down. I am getting more for the rest of the shrubs and sandy areas."
1,Doesn't Work,I applied it outside and the cat used the stuff for kitty litter! There is no way to contact the company.Bad news.
1,Just plain doesn't work,"Bought this stuff, hoping it would work. Spread it according to the directions all over my garden. Within 5 minutes, my cat was curled up right in the middle of the garden, fast asleep. Flat out doesn't work."
1,No Good,Spread per direction and cats still did their thing. Used all of it till my eyes burned but didn't stop the cats.
2,Not a good product,"I don't recommend these at all. Many years ago when this product first was introduced, it did a pretty good job. However, now it just doesn't touch anything symptomatic of allergy problems. All they have in this is 1,000mg of Tylenol, which is hard on your liver, 60mg of pseudoephedrine, and the allergy medication which is not Benadryl. This stuff will mildly clear your head of stuffiness, but it does nothing to block allergy symptoms or get rid of the pain. My chest was so tight that I could hardly breathe. You would think all that Tylenol would do SOMETHING but that is not the case. I had to come back home and take Advil to shrink the swelling in my head and then take Claritin to get rid of the allergy symptoms. Save your money on this one - grab the Advil Allergy version of this - your swelling will cease and the allergy portion will be much more relieved. I don't recommend this at all."
3,not strong,You must do your best to improve the quality of your item because you cannot afford that a customer buys an item so expensive and he will not arrive to find a great satisfaction.
4,"Smells classic, sophisticated","One of those classic, sophisticated perfumes I have in my collection of perfumes. Lasts longer than most cologne did."
3,Save system is very poor,"The game is fairly well done and the moves are cool. But the saving system is poor. Several levels are extremely easy to complete to get to a save (one level between saves is killing 3 guards and that is it). And then the next level will be 20+ mins of playing, killing 25+ guards.Not enough time or thought went into where to put the saves in order to keep the frustration levels in line. No one likes having to redo large portions of a game because the saves are not well thought out.Dark Angel developers should take some time and learn from Splinter Cell developers on how to do saves."
1,you got to be kidding me,"As long as people continue to buy this garbage, the developers will continue to produce this trash. Anyone that has had the displeasure of playing this game will no what I'm talking about. Kill 10 men in under 60 seconds or die! Wow! What fun! Or later on in the game... If the enemy sees you, you die! Wow! This just keeps getting better! After about 5 levels, the game is nearly impossible to play even on the easy level. You can't even save your progress until the end of each level. If the developers cared even a little bit about this game, they would've at least allowed your character to move while you're shooting your X5 gun. Spare yourself the pain, and don't buy this game. This is by far the biggest embarrassment to hit the XBOX."
4,Dark Angel... Skip!,"I bought Dark Angel a long time ago, and I loved it! Although, it is extremely difficult and I can't pass most of the levels. When I worked myself through the game, it got harder and sucked even more! Unless Dark Angel is your IDOL, do not spend any cash on this hunk of junk!"
5,its the best show,i still have not played the game but i never missed an episode of dark angel the game looks so like the show except the face it kidda looks lke jessica alba but its ok i think they should bring the show back on fox so the fans can enjoy the show they dont even play reruns thats stupid it was a great show and if they dont make a movie a lot of fans wll be very mad!
3,Branston City Limits. Ronnie Milsap.,DO NOT BE FOOLED AS I WAS BY THE PREVIEW LIVE. When i first purchased this album Branston City Limits i actually thought i was purchasing a piece of Ronnie Milsap history LIVE; At least that what i was lead to believe. In fact it is none other than an early compilation of some of Ronnie Milsap's Early works.It's a pretty good album for someone who is just sampling Ronnie's Music for the very first time. NOT for the Hardened Milsap fans.
2,"Good Support, very uncomfortable","That pretty much says it all. Now, I remember why I buy $30+ bras. :-( Oh, well, you can never have too many spares that remind you why you buy your bras from Cacique."
1,not cotton where you need it,"only the outside of this bra is cotton, the inside is not. I was looking for 100% cotton, or at least to have the cotton side against my skin."
3,"Good bra, shapes well","I liked this bra a lot. It shapes beautifully and gives a nice line to your clothes, even if you have large breasts. I only wish it had a bit more give in the fabric. The cotton is a bit rigid and feels constraining. More movement would be nice. If you like cotton bras, this is a nice one and you can't beat the price."
5,Awesome!,"LOVE THIS BRA! It's the most comfortable bra ever, and the fact that it doesn't make my breasts pointy is fantastic. The nice wide straps are so great, I wear a 36D and it fit perfectly. No modesty lining though, but I use it as a sports bra and it's amazing. Definitely check your wal-mart first to see if they have these, where I am they sell them for $10, and they have a lot of my size, I only wish they came in more colors. Triple hook and eye."
5,Best bra I've ever owned,"Comfortable, supportive, sizes are accurate, no ""overflow"" or empty gaps! Bought my first one at Walmart, went back for two more. Then found them here at a better price and without all the digging thru the bins. I only wish they were available in black!"
3,NordicWare Belgian Waffler,Was looking at replacing my waffler but mine is a older model that has the thermometer which is handy-knew when the burner needed to be turned down because the waffler was getting to hot! I would probably purchase another one if NordicWare still sold the deluxe ones but will wait for that time.
5,better than I thought,"I remember my grandma's electric waffle iron, I tried the electric waffle maker, but this is better. You have to use a butter spray or it won't work. I was surprised how well they turned out. No more pancakes, waffles from now on"
1,Wheres the thermometer,"Ok the picture is fuzzy, but I was sure for the price I was getting the model with the thermometer. Oh well, back to ebay."
1,The stickiest waffle iron ever,"If you like wasting waffle mix and scrubbing the daylight out of a waffle iron to get all the sticky mix off, this is your waffle iron. I've tried two different mixes, I oil the thing every time, wash with soap after and it always sticks. Super frustrated with this thing."
5,Great alternative to counter-top waffle appliance,"My husband and I just love this waffle iron! I saw the exact same model in a retail store in my neighborhood, but am glad I got it for much less on Amazon. It's very easy to clean and stores easily. We put it in the dishwasher a couple of times by accident, but it was fine (the instructions say to hand wash it). We only grease the waffle iron a bit, and the waffles release easily every time. We have a gas stove, I am not sure how well this would work with an electric."
2,First Liked It Then Not So Much,"UPDATE... 2 stars... Now that I've had this several months my opinion has changed. It has started to over cook one side consistently It is always the side I cook second (after the flipping of the skillet).Original Review... 5 stars... We make homemade waffles about 4-5 times a week. I was tired of having to replace plug-in waffle irons every year... no matter the brand or price point we paid, they simply give out after a year and start sticking, burning, etc. This stove-top waffle iron is great. Our waffles never stuck, not even on the first use. Simply spray with Pam and heat each side of the griddle for 1 minute on medium-low heat... then pour in batter... we heat the first side for 50 seconds and the second side for 2.5 minutes on medium-low heat. Delicious."
3,Not as Pictured,"We bought one of these wafflers over 20 years ago and had great success with it. Unfortunately it was lost in a move, so I bought a replacement. I think the actual waffler is the same, but Nordicware eliminated the two temperature gauges (still shown in the ad photo) which makes it more difficult to use since you can't tell if the temperature is correct. I have used it twice and the were waffles perfect once and over cooked the second time. Three stars for the waffler - would have been more with the original temperature gauges. Amazon should use the correct photo in the ad!"
4,NordicWare Waffle Iron,"This makes excellent waffles. No need to spend a fortune on fancy electrical ones, when this does the trick just as well, and it's MUCH easier to clean."
5,Great Product!,"This waffle iron is awesome! Pick a great recipe and your waffles will be fluffy and yummy.Read the instructions, it takes a few tries to get them perfect. It's no more than 1 minute for the first side then flip for 2 minutes. It's that easy!I recommend this product over the electric waffle products."
4,25 Plus Years and still going strong!,"This is the best waffler you can buy. We have a gas cook top and it performs better than any other. Our family has enjoyed years of great waffles off this device. We especially like to add walnuts to the basic batter. Many a happy Sunday brunch for us. In fact, I am happy with all the Nordic Ware products I own...and they are all made right here in the USA."
2,Missing important part,"I haven't decided to keep or not- because the item came without the thermometers that are pictured here.The thermometers are supposed to tell you that that waffle is cooked, and I am afraid that without them,this becomes another kitchen item the will never get used."
1,wrong belgian waffler. No temp gauges,It took a month and a half to get the wrong waffler. Why in the world would nordic make one without the temp gauges in it? It was totaly worthless to me. thanks but NO thanks I sent it back. cost me 8.45 to return it. Kinda leaves me out in the cold. Rich
2,Awesome pen,did not buy it from amazon.but came to rate this because i love it so much :DEditted:ok i dropped it on wooden floor and it broke. -_-i dropped it at maybe about 3 foot height.wow...
4,Very responsive,"After a couple of tanks of gas and some dizzy 11/9 year olds I've got to give this two thumbs up. The tube is very responsive and easy to ""work"" from the boat driver. It is also very stable. At one point we about got it completely on its side but the rider stayed onOnly negatives are that it doesn't come with an air pump, the bottom is hard to inflate/deflate as it doesn't have the boston valve like the main chamber and it does not come with a quick release harness."
5,Better than remembered,I saw this series years ago and was excited to be able to buy it. I actually expected it to be more dated. Dr. Schaeffer did a marvelous job of making this study timeless.
4,andrewgreer was here,ya it was a okay game but it was so easy on all levels.!!!!!!let me give you a hint on facing count.d.dont use force power on him use the spin attack on him strate on dont move away or his lightning will stike!!!!
1,Couldn't even use,"The measurements given for this litter box are completely off. If you are looking for a small litter box, which I was, do not buy this! I had to return it."
4,IMPROVED BOX!,"I believed this is an improved design from the other Booda box. The sides are high, inverted lip to prevent urine leaks outside, filter on the outside to prevent being knock off by the cat. Cute cat head shape entrance opening and nice pink color! It is on the small side, should be best for avg sized cats and kittens, no larger than 10 lbs, i think."
4,The Good-night Kiss,I enjoyed reading the Good-night Kiss to my three year old daughter immensely. I am a mother of three and quiet alone time with an individual child is very important to me. This book has excellent soothing pitcures and as we are all snuggled up in her bed there is a tranquil effect.The story line in the book was enjoyable allowing my daughter to see things from a different aspect.The best thing about the book is that as it closes a tender kiss is shared (that I also give to my daughter)and a memory has been created.
1,The LUVCart is not powerful/durable enough for home use.,"I purchased the LUVCart hoping that it would be a great tool for doing small jobs around the house such as moving pea gravel, dirt, and moving items back and forth from the house to my vehicle. However the LUVCart failed almost immediately after being purchased. The LUVCart is a great idea, and the plastic tub that holds material seems to be fairly well constructed. The weak point seems to be the motor and circuitry. The LUVCart only operated for me for less than an hour before it stopped working and would not restart. Even while it was in operation it strained under the very small load of pea gravel in its bucket, and the bucket was not even half full. The 5 cubic foot of material that the LUVCart is capable of handling is a wild exaggeration unless you only want to haul 5 cubic feet of grass clippings or dry leaves."
3,Michael Rother - 'Suessherz Und Tiefenscharfe' (Random),"Originally released in 1985,this was the former Kraftwerk,Neu! and Harmonia member's sixth solo CD.Best described as 'deep ambient'.Not that HUGE of a fan of Rother's solo work,but I thought this piece was decent,with the two best tracks being the thirteen minute ""Tiefenscharte"" and ""Glitzerglanz""(nice keyboard work),plus the two '94 added bonus cuts aren't bad either.Check it out if you think this sounds somewhat of interest."
1,Simply awful,"US Senator Tom Flanagan gains the power to raise the dead, which makes him the target of machinations by powerful groups such as the US government and the Catholic Church.This is a terribly written novel with clumsy characterizations. Author Thomas F. Monteleone comes off like a crazy militant libertarian at times. His depiction of the government is filled with unabashedly sinister and self-serving caricatures that all but rub their hands together with glee and cackle over their evil plans. The whole millennial fever aspect of the story seems silly in retrospect (and seemed silly to some of us even at the time). The pointless subplot involving Flanagan's visions of a burning man foreshadow something that is completely unconnected to the main story. Perhaps it was meant to be developed in a sequel. Was such a sequel ever written? I couldn't care less."
1,Save Your Money,"I purchased this cookie sheet a year ago as an additional one to supplement the starter set I got from Chicago Metallic. A couple weeks after receiving it (and only a few uses) the non-stick coating started to flake off. I followed the instructions-reducing the cooking temp by 25 degrees for the dark coating and not using metal utensils but after cooking fish fillets at 400 (well under the 500+ degree limit they give) I found my food stuck the sheet and the sheet coating flaking off when I tried to lift the fish off with a nylon turner. I will never buy Nordic Ware again. My Chicago Metallic stuff, on the other hand, is holding up decently (although I am still not totally convinced of the value of expensive bakeware)."
1,Lao's review,"Cleaves translation of this work is very turn of the century, reminiscent of many of the early translators who attempted to totally reformat both the words and meter in order to presumably make them more readable to English speaking audiences. Unfortunately this ends up as a bastardized version of the original, and leaves the reader feeling as though they had just read a fairy tale, rather than a history.If you are seriously intersted in this book, buy the Paul Kahn translation instead. He retains the prose style of writing, as well as keeping closer to the original spelling and grammar."
2,Good thing I bought it on sale,"I bought this CD b/c of ""Bounce"" and nothing's changed.I was really disappointed with FITF b/c it's not my type.Other than boring beats and climaxes that are waiting to happen,but dont; FITF just isn't fit for me.I'll take Euro-house anyday."
5,GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT,"A bold and brilliantly crafted collaboration of fresh, funky beats and melodic tunes catapults this album above and beyond all others of this genre. The album starts strong with energetic beats and wicked scratching in ""Beat Bionic"" before it slows you down a little toward the middle of the album by introducing a totally original track called ""Dreamtime"". It's hypnotizing vocals and curiously smooth pitter-patter flow keeps you mesmerized until the very last beat. Just when you think you're reaching the light, you're hit with massive bass and kicks in ""Rhythm Device"" and you realize that you've still got your whole life ahead of you. The album continues on strong and keeps you tickled pink with each developing track, especially with ""Frequency"" and ""Faith in the Future"" because their concepts are so unique and innovative (words simply cannot explain). Good things come to those who wait because the album ends with the classic, ""Botz"", and need I say more?"
2,damn,"i love uberzone. i have seen them play live a number of times and i've been blown away. i have a number of their singles which are fantastic and for these reasons i don't understand why this album is SO bafflingly LOUSY. I plan to give it a few more listens, but as of now, i plan to sell it."
3,Decent Racing Game,"I disagree with the other reviewer. All Star Racing isn't the best racing game out there, but it does have some decent graphics and I had a blast playing the game."
5,A swingin' CD.,The vocals are great! The musicians are incredible. The tunes are performed honestly and with great poise. Would highly recommend this CD for the person who enjoys standard jazz vocals that swing.
4,Self-discovery or Self-delusion?,"Stanislav Grof is up to no good again. In this book, he takes a look at some of the bizarre states that can result using his holotropic breathing techniques (here he doesn't need LSD, like he has used for therapy in the past). He categorizes these states into systems of condensed experience (COEX), basic perinatal matrices (BPM I-IV), and other transpersonal states. As in his other works, Grof believes that the individual can be regressed to birth and beyond, so as to reexperience the birth trauma and resolve all neuroses which result from it. (I personally have a hard time buying that this actually occurs.) The explanation of the transpersonal states is exceedingly bizarre, and includes everything from cosmic consciousness to the appearance of UFO's. Add to this a blend of Eastern mysticism, existential philosophy, Jungian psychology and virtually any other strange or far-fetched system for understanding the world, and you have this book."
4,Slayers try,"In this one secrets of the past are unraveled, and Lina learns the truth about the Golden Dragons. With this knowledge, she must defeat the otherworldly threat of the Dark star. But standing in ther way are BANDITS... AND DRAGONS... and MONSTERS. CAN SHE DO IT!?!, BUY IT AND FIND OUT."
4,Big_Sarge_NJ,"Use this all the time to make beef jerky and fruit rolls....this works it very good but fruit rolls take a long time,(almost 24 hours) but otherwise its perfect for me...was able to fit 16, 3x1 inch strips of ground beef jerky on each tray and they were ready in 4-5 hours....great product for the price"
4,Ask a question,"We bought our Harvest Maid FD 50/30 model about 20 years ago and need new trays, have no idea if ours is a Nesco, went to ask a question, they wanted $39 for it. I'm not happy with this, should be free...! All I wanted to know is if Harvest Maid dehydrator is now Nesco Harvest Maid Dehydrator. Most important, if the add-a-tray will fit our old ""still works like new"" dehydrator."
5,Great Jerky,I purchased these extra trays so I could increase the amount of jerky I can make at one time. Great products.
3,Nesco American Harvest Add-A-Tray,"I purchased an American Harvest 2 tray dehydrator at a thrift store. This is just what I needed to dry more vegetables. One of the trays is warped, but when it is on the bottom, the other trays weight it down to fit tight. I am glad that I could get the extra trays to make my dehydrator more efficient."
5,Necso American Harvest Add-A-Tray works Great,The Add-a-tray for food dehydrator model FD-50 looks and performs exactly as the original. The extra trays make drying larger quantities of food faster and easier.
3,Would be 5 Stars if not defective,"I bought these add-on trays for my FD-61. One of the trays had a warp in the center so, while it can be used, it can only be the top tray so the weight of the top piece holds it down. Amazon was very helpful in fixing the issue in a way that I was happy with and did not involve me having to box and ship the product back. I just think Nesco needs to be a bit better at their quality control.On a side note, if you have the FD-61 these do fit but they are a slightly different color. I expected this and it can even be helpful if you are drying different flavors of jerky and don't want to mix them up. Again, this would be a 5 star item if Nesco would make sure they weren't sending out defective items."
3,Good product,"Not much could be said here. Extra plastic trays. A bit overpriced for just two trays. I stacked 7 once on the dehydrator and it worked nicely. cleanup is easy with meat but a bit harder with vegetable products. You may have to soak overnight. Overall, good product."
3,Better Deal,"I recently got my Nesco FD-60 dehydrator and asolutley love it. I have probably spent $300 in meat and fruit this first month alone, going crazy trying different recipes out. And, I'll certainly admit that this here $14 is the best deal on the expansion trays. But why spend $30 dollars on 4 trays when for $45 you can get 4 trays, a fruit roll sheet ($4-$5 value) and a second dehydrator lid and base from Walmart. The only accessory I would recommend buying is the fruit roll trays, but even there I have used foil and plastic wrap: each to limitted success."
2,looks good but...,"At the beginning was great, lot of fun just looking at it. But then the battery run out. We bought two batteries but not enough, it will clean for 10 min. maximun and the battery takes more than 12 hours to charge!On the other hand it is very messy to clean it, you have to clean the brushes daily otherwise the hair (I have long hair and it looks like the Roomba has more than me)is not going to let her work. It is a mess to clean hair from the brushes, you need to use a sharp knife....at the end takes more time than cleanning the old fashion way (with normal vacuum cleaner). We bouth the Roomba, and 2 months later I bought an upright vacuum. That works for sure!Do not recomend."
1,Nothing sucks like a Remanufactured Roomba,"The first one I got was broken. I called amazon, they sent another. It came, and it was broken. I called amazon, they sent yet another. The third one I got was broken, but in a different way. The first two could have been broken in shipping, hence the call to amazon. The last one had a bad part. One of the sensors it uses to detect stairs was broken, and it took a flying leap down my stairs 3 times during its first cleaning. I called Roomba directly and they shipped me another one, that was not broken.I was thinking about getting this for people for Christmas, but since I had all kinds of problems getting mine to work at all, I decided against it."
4,"Great robot, but buy a new one!","I own three Roombas. One at home is the nicey-nice model, and two Roomba reds at work. My first Roomba red is this one. However, after two months it is malfunctioning and serves as a battery charger for a second battery. My other two that I bought new are running great still. I highly recommend one of these."
3,Battery Issue With Remanufactured Red Roomba,We only had approximately 20 minutes of use the first two times we used the remanufactured roomba before the battery died.The unit cleaned quite well aside from the battery issue. We called tech support at I Robot and after charging the battery for 72 hours the battery was completely dead.It took about an hour to get through to tech support the second time. They are sending me a new replacement battery.
2,Would be great if it wasnt broken,"My Roomba Red worked for about 5 minutes before peices started falling out from under it. Turns out it had a defective Brush Guard.However, in those 5 minutes it managed to pick up a lot of stuff and was very entertaining."
5,Works Great,"The first Irobot would not hold the dust bin... Irobot promptly replaced the bin... Realized it was the unit, contacted Irobot and they promptly replaced the entire unit.The little robot works great!"
5,Finally! Robots are here!,"My wife and I are enthralled with the Roomba!We have three ""children,"" Boxers!Needless to say, they shed, shall we say constantly!The Roomba has been a perfect tool for doing thedaily sweeping. We love it! The ""Kids"" love him too!We heartily endorse this product!"
1,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I bought this product I thought that I would be happy, But I found out that the revolutionary vaccum is a thing that is an amazing idea and a bad product. I know that some people are very happy with there vaccum so I decided to buy one this christmas for my mother. once I opened the package Pieces began to fall out. I tryed out the Roomba to see it take a leap down the stairs, suck up a socks, and well..... it just wouldn't do anything. It was fun watching the Roomba smash into things for about 5 min., and then I realize that this was not a vaccum but another thing that I would have to keep an eye on.If one of my friends were asking me if they should buy a Roomba, I won't tell them no, but I will tell them to keep there receipt!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's just easier to go around the house and spend ten min.s vaccuming yourself and knowing that the house is clean!"
3,Just Ok,"I rarely use it, you have to clean it too often for it to work well. It does a decent job, just don't think you won't need to manually vacuum because it's not that great. It's just ok."
2,Cleans great but battery life not good!! =35-45min,Well I have had great luck in the past with refurbished Irobot Roombas but this one has a bum battery. It will only last 35-45 minutes. Since I have owned many of these I have learned all the tricks to get the max life out of one of these batteries but not this one. The unit cleans great though so it will earn 2 stars from me.
2,It's a little bit of help,"I bought this product for my parents for Christmas. They asked me to return it because it kept getting caught up on their area rugs and getting lost behind one of their couches. I decided to try it out and found that it works ok in square areas with very few obsticals. It takes forever to clean the hallway, and it runs out of battery in the great room before it has covered all of the area. I decided to go ahead and keep it for the help it gives me in the bedrooms. It's kind of like having a small child helping you with the housework. It helps a little, and I'll take all the help I can get these days."
3,....It's OK,"Ok, the robot is pretty cool...but the one I got has power issues. I followed the instructions but the battery never got a full charge. Or maybe this being a refurb the battery was used and was not charged properly. In any case, after following customer care's instructions I dis-charged it and then recharged it a couple of times...charging it 72 hours (3 days!) before use each time as instructed. It now holds a 30 min charge which is just enough for the floor I am using it on...but no where near the ""rated"" run time. It is better than the 5 min run time it had when I first got it, and it is such a hassle to send the battery back that I am just gonna live with it. Otherwise it runs pretty good. You do have to empty the unit pretty much each time you use it (put a trash can near the unit and its not too big a deal). Overall I am not sorry I purchased it."
3,t Schipper,"Works great, fun to watch. Cleans the easy stuff, still need to run a real vaccume once in a while."
2,roomba,"I love the idea of this product, but in reality, it isn't that great. The roomba is high maintainence and expensive after you buy all of the accessories. It's currently not working well and doesn't suck up the dirt like it claims. Furthermore the battery life is very limited and spends most of the time being charged and recharged."
2,Saw the positive reviews and bought it...,"I bought this remanufactured Rumba a few weeks ago (it is has already been returned) and was pretty impressed with the job it did. I know a lot of people are skeptical and I was too, but the unit was able to prove itself and is actually intertaining to watch it drive around the living room and bump into things. Ah... who needs TV?In any case, the issue I had with mine was the battery life. I charged the unit for a long time twice (20 hours?) but the robot would not handle more than 25 minutes of continuous vacuuming. Both times it died in the middle of the room and I had to rush to rescue as it was making its SOS signals, which were annoying enough to interrupt the dinner.On a side note, the unit is cool, but mine did look used, the surface was scratched and the buttons were worn off! Perhaps I got the worst of the bunch, but make sure you test the battery extensively when you get it!"
1,Poor product and worst customer service,"I am surprised to see that this product is rated so high here.Perhaps you guys are just lucky.I bought my Roomba in late September, which worked fine for 1 monthand half. And then it can't be charged anymore.I contacted Roomba Customer Service, they gave me some useless suggestions and asked for the serial number of my Roomba. I sent then the serial number >4 times, from early Nov. till the end of November. No response!On their website, there's no phone number. So I can't talk to their manager and complain :("
5,iRobot Roomba Red,"Have been using iRobot product for the past 3 years. Great product. Love it. I have Roomba Pro Elite and Roomba Red. My Roomba Pro Elite is still running till today but my Roomba Red can only run for 5 mins and stop (not battery issue though, no idea what!) I am using the Roomba Red to charge the battery to be used on Roomba Pro Elite.Roomba Red seems to have charging circuit issue. Bought some 5-6 units over the past 2 years for friends & relatives. About 4 units have to buy the Rooomba Rapid Charger to charge instead now."
1,"Works pretty well, reliablility still a question","So far it works pretty well, as a floor sweeper, it isn't really a vacuum. But because we have a dog it does a pretty good job. I am unsure about its reliablility, seems pretty flimsy, I don't think it'll last more than a year, but for 100$ its a pretty good value.EDIT:Fell apart after 6 months. Battery charger is a problem. If you buy any roomba, make sure you don't leave it on the charger."
1,Broken Sweeper,"Got this for my grandaughter to give to her mommy for Christmas and it was broken in pieces, she cried when her mommy opened the box. Your company had none to replace it."
3,I got it cheap but it does not work so well,I purchased a refurb unit as an X-mas gift for my mother. She does not use it very much it just sits around. It is quite loud and does not do a very good job of vacuuming. When it goes from a hard floor to carpeting or vice versa it dumps a bunch of dirt.
5,My new best friend,"other than the fact that you need to clean it at the end of the day, this little wonder will clean the house for you when you are gone. It does not replace real vacuuming but it will reduce the frequency that you need to do it. The kids love it as well."
3,It cleans like crazy but...,"The Roomba picks up an amazing amount of dirt, dust, pet hair, fuzz and other forms of shmootz however, I'm not wild about having all that dirt in my face when I have to clean it after every use.You can't just push the button and empty it into the trash. There are places the dirt hides and you have to find them all. Sometimes, the side brush has to be removed to clean under it. The 2 main rollers have to be cleaned each time and the brush roller is not easy to clean. There's a movable portion under the cleaning rollers. That has to be lifted to clean under but it will only lift about 1/2"", so you have to dig for the dirt clump and it is always a clump.The unit gets its nose stuck under a sideboard and hangs up on the feet of the CD rach and the firewood rack. It's banged into the cat but she doesn't seem to have been injured.All in all, I can't imagine using this thing when I'm old and feeble."
3,Fun at first but really not that useful,"It was ""cool"" when we got it, but it turned out we just didn't use it much. It seems easier to just vacuum the old fashioned way than to charge this thing, use it, and then clean it. Plus, it runs on batteries so it can't pick up nearly the amount of stuff that a much more powerful vacuum can. It may be a fun little device, but once the fun is over, it isn't very useful over a real vacuum cleaner or swiffer, at least it wasn't for us."
3,"good suction, scratches hardwood floors","The roomba is a fantastic idea and a great design - I had high hopes that it would make short work of the dog hair in my house and it performed well in that respect. My main complaint, however, is that the brush bristles left very fine, steel-wool like scratches on my painstakingly hand-finshed hardwood floors. For those with carpets or tile floors, this would be a perfect product. For those with finished floors, I'd consider a canister vacuum."
3,Roomba is a toy,"This robot is fun to watch, and pretty smart. It is a pain to empty the small dirt holder when full. The brushes etc. need to be cleaned as well. Also, the battery capacity is not great, so it only cleans for about half an hour. This is about one 500 sq. ft. room. Overall, this is an interesting product, but no great aid to keeping your house clean."
2,Waist of time (and money),It's extremely loud... and the collecting container in the back keeps falling off and it falls over stairs and It can't go 1 hour without have to recharge. It was a big waist of time and I hope they come out with a better one... bottom line it was a good idea that was poorly executed.
3,Not good for large room,I have a really large living room/dining room area and it missed several spots because it kept going over the same areas. But it works really well in small areas like hallways or bathrooms or bedrooms.
2,Don't buy it!,Worked great the first couple of times. I didn't keep it on the charger for 24 hours (not realizing that this is a problem) and now the battery only works for 10 minutes at a time. It's now basically worthless.
4,Roomba Red,"This vacume works great. its amazing how it works, if it hits a dirty spot a blue light comes on and it goes around in a circle till this spot is clean. I won a bid for a home base charger last night, so I am ancious to get it."
1,Not what I hoped for ...,"After reading the amazingly fantastic book, Quest for a Maid, I came upon this book, which is by the same author, hoping to have the same experience. This was not the case. This book was confusing, with too many names to keep straight. It was a good plot, yet not very well told. I kept counting the pages till I'd be done. It follows Jeannie, a young girl, in her adventures. It is during the 1700s and is set in Scotland. Jeannie experiences pain, death, meaning, belief, and much more, but after a while you don't care what happens. You shouldn't feel a need to read this book, and if you are looking for a exciting, well-written book, read Quest for a Maid instead."
3,Jewel Case Distroyed,"First let me say that this is a double cd. The #1 disc was ok, but there are three cut off of songs on the second. Now, that is why I was appauled at the shape the jewel case was in. It was in three pieces and taped together. The case was scratched and cloudy. Now I have to store this 2 disc cd in seperate cases. Plus the price of almost $8 was too high. Very disappointed, and to send it back, and chanch getting something wore from this distributor, well it would have to be to my benefit to do so."
4,Nice resource,"I bought it mostly for the brewing calendar. It's a nice guide for when to brew different styles. Most of the recipes come from the National Homebrew competitions. The book assumes you already know how to brew. Most recipes have just the basic info about mash temp, etc. There is an awesome mead recipe - ""After Dinner Dessert""."
1,Grossly disappointling!,"The recipies contained in this book include white flour--need I say more? The author also recommends store bought soy and rice milks--hasn't she read the labels of these? They usually contain refined sugars. I realize that the presence and the elimination of candida is scientifically debated, and generally poo-pooed by the medical world. Still, I believe that in the world of alternative and natural health it is widely accepted that to eliminate candida the first things to go are wheat flour and sugar. The title and kindle sample are misleading to the buyer. I will think twice before purchasing another kindle book. Can I have my money back?"
3,Like the anime version better...,"I had watched most of the anime version and decided to buy the first book. It was cute, but there wasn't that same kinda feeling about it and alot of the characters weren't in it from the anime version that personally I like better. It really depends all in all. My advice, first watch the anime, then buy the manga if you really are a crazy fan like I am ^-^"
5,The Little Saw That Could,I was quite dissapointed when I first received the saw. It quickly tired on small branches and would not allow me to apply any pressure or it would stall out. I called Makita customer service and returned it for repair. They replaced the DC motor and some gears and now it does what it is supposed to do. I love it for trimming branches on trees. I use it on my Christmas tree farm alot to square off trunks after customers cut them down. The extension works well but I do feel the product is a bit pricey.
3,It's OK...,"It chews through wood rather than cutting it cleanly. It would be a much better saw if they did one (or 2 ) things to improve it's design. #1- Faster cutting speed... The blades are the same as a large chain saw, so it cuts roughly at the low speed it's currently set at. AND/OR #2- Reduce the size of the cutting blades and add more of them. Let's just say that I'm not sorry that I bought it, but I will NEVER buy another one until they improve the design so that it cuts smoothly and cleanly. If you are purchasing this to do pruning work, don't waste your time... IT BITES!"
5,The definitive collection of a great triple threat,"Fats Waller was one of the great artists of American popular song between the two world wars, and he ruled in at least three arenas: songwriting, pianoplaying, and singing. This CD is the best one-disc collection of his work, with a good mix of his best work in all three areas. About the only track I'd like to see that isn't here is ""African Ripples,"" but it does have ""This Joint Is Jumpin'"" ""Viper's Drag,"" ""Porter's Lovesong,"" ""Handful of Keys,"" and one of the two really great versions Waller did of ""Honeysuckle Rose."" Although it says ""Collector's Choice,"" it's an album for enjoyment as much as completeness."
5,Puts a smile on your face!,"Excellent compilation of Fats Waller's recordings...both solo piano tracks and with his band. He sings on some of the songs too...as always, his music making puts a smile on your face and gets your toes a tappin'!"
4,Fun read,I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down. The female author did a great job writing as a gay man...I know as a gay man I was very drawn into several scenes. It just goes to show you that passion knows no boundaries. I would highly recommend this as a light fun read.
5,Perfect,sturdy enough to last. Great value and perfect to help withe state regulations and children's learning. Would highly recomment. Thank you
1,Frustration,"The technology in this toy is inadequate. It simply cannot perform the functions that you'd expect from reading the ads. The most basic commands don't trigger the appropriate responses from the robot, so we tend to not even turn it on. The novelty wore off very quickly."
2,"Cute, but that's all","We tried really hard to follow all of the instructions for R2. He didn't listen to any of the commands except to ""go on patrol"", and he didn't listen well to that. He's very cute and will be a nice addition to a top shelf in my son's room, but that's about it."
3,Not for a 4 year old!!!,"I purchased this droid for my 4 year old son for Christmas. After reading all of the reviews posted on amazon I thought it would be the perfect gift. Unfortnantley, the droid does not listen at all. We have spent hours trying to understand the little creature but have had no luck. We will be returning Mr. R2 back to the galaxy that he came from. Bummer!!! My son loves star wars and I thought I was going to go down as the greatest mom in history for getting this robot. Wishful thinking was all this droid provided my ego! But the DS Lite that I got him with the star wars trilogy game was a big hit!"
2,Misbehaving Disappointment - a 9 yr. old's view,"I bought this for my 9 year old nephew and his techie ""Star Wars"" nut Dad. My nephew was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited on Christmas Day when he recieved it. Not so excited when the voice activation just fails to work well. He says Thought it might be broken - but it works a bit, occassionally for one command - and then I read the other reviews where everyone else (many of them as tech-savvy as my brother) couldn't get it to work right either.Here it is in my nephew's word: ""If you swat him on the head, he'll do something. He just misbehaved. I haven't used it since I played with him the first night on Christmas eve.""My bottom line: VERY DISSAPPOINTING QUALITY."
4,really fun toy,"when i bought this for my 6 year oldgrandson i wasn't sure what to expect, but it's really cool. Both he and his older brother (not to mention dad) have spent hours playing with their robot! it really is amazing how it responds!"
2,a little flimsy,"I like the pattern, but the lunch box is cloth--completely soft sided. I guess it makes it easier to wash, but lunch can get squished."
1,1-HIT-WONDER,"NOT REAL DEAL BECAUSE SHE HAD TO REDO SONG FOR COMPANYSHE DOES NOTHING WITH HER MUSICSHE IS UNTALENTEDSHE FLOPSHE IS 1-HIT-WONDER FOR HER HIT ""PIECES OF ME"""
1,Old Schenectady - paperback,"The purpose of reproducing historical books is to accurately preserve history.This reproduction is an inferior copy of the 1906 original book.Even though cutting edge technology was used (Optical Character Recognition) to create this reproduction it introduced so many errors that one cannot even decipher the original text.The description of the book does not hint that it is not a photocopy but a poor copy generated by OCR.Anyone could instantly see the errors in the book - they are on every page, every paragraph and every sentence. No one in the book reproduction business should allow such an inferior copy to be printed let alone offered for sale.Here is a sample from beginning of book on Page 4:""Chapter 1. The Settlement. MEAXIXG OF SCHEXECTADY."" (What is that about???)I am demanding a refund. My rating:Quality - poor.Transcription - zeroProfessional reprint - zeroIt is not as advertised."
5,JUST AMAZING,I bought this book following the guidances of my son's german teacher. This books and the rest of titles of Aldous Huxley is a good begining for those who want to introduce themselves to the politics and social analitics world.
4,A fascinating book,"With spare and elegant prose, Loretta Ellsworth tells the story of Evie, who lives in southeastern Minnesota in the mid-1800s. The daughter of a Scotswoman and a German farmer, Evie is by turns kind and ferocious, learning to deal with the death of her mother and the care of a loving aunt she has never met before. There are real characters in this book, painted keenly. Aunt Flo, who comes to live with Evie and Mae and their papa, her brother, is a shrouding woman. I confess to being reluctant to read this book because of Aunt Flo's work with death and funerals. Now I'm sorry that I waited so long. What did people do to care for their dead in a time before undertakers and mortuaries? With gentle explanation and intriguing description, this book is a look at this unusual aspect of history, woven deftly into a richly textured story."
3,"Nice tool, good price, like new","The only way I can tell it's not new is the ""R"" stamped on the serial number plate and a green sticker on it. The trigger pull is light but just right, not a hair trigger but quick and easy. An adjustable air exhaust director on the top lets you point the unpleasant (if you had to aim it at your face) blast of air away from you no matter which way you need to point the tool. Some other brands I've used don't have this feature. It's light but seems sturdy and well built, it's a pleasure to use. [I only wish my air compressor weren't so darn noisey.] I glue together lots of boxes to make speaker prototypes and this sure beats using clamps by a longshot.*edit* The one I had was stolen so I ordered a replacement, this one was scratched up and the trigger felt loose and wobbly, it didn't have the ""R"" on the sticker like the last one, clearly it was just repaired and not reconditioned to ""like new"" condition. So I'm lowering my rating to three stars from five."
1,Wrong Item,I ordered a Platinum Gamecube Controller . I received a Wireless Wavebird. Now they say it's out of stock or discontinued. Thay should tell you this before they charge you card and send you the wrong thing.
4,GameCube Controller,This product is dependable it is made by nintendo so you know it will work not like the cheep controllers!
2,False!,This product is using false advertising. It is not an actual Gamecube brand controller. It is a generic brand that is selling their product at the same price of an actual quality Gamecube controller. I would recommend buying somewhere else.
2,Not,Product was not what was shown in the picture. not made by nintendo. instead a cheaper off brand
2,Great Inventions - Not So Great Book,"As an engineer, I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, the writing tends to be a little dry.This book is basically a number of short articles, one to two pages in length, on a large number of inventions. It covers agricultural, mechanical, chemical, and a number of other inventions or discoveries. It gives a brief history of each invention, and then describes the invention.Often, however, the descriptions are crying for a good illustration. And while there are illustrations scattered throughout the book, there just aren't enough."
2,High Sierra Metra,"The backpack seemed to be well made, but it was too small for my 4th grader to fit her portfolio and other notebooks in without a hassle. I had to buy another bag within a month after school started."
5,"wrong color, but great bag","this bag is perfect for the gym. I was sent the wrong color, but it wasnt really a big deal for me"
5,Hip and Swinging,"A great album of sexy, downbeat electronic grooves and lounge beatz. I love this collection of music as it's perfectly mixed for a great cocktail party at your house or I've even heard it being played at many lounge/bars here in San Francisco.The collection has some excellent tracks by great artists like Llorca doing The End, Gotan Project's Last Tango In Paris, Zimpala doing Do You Bop, Tommy Hools doing Barcelone and Czerkinski's Natacha on Disc 1.On Disc 2 which is the Paris By Night CD you get great artists like St. Germain doing My Mama Said, Kojax doing Soul Unit, Stephane Pompougnac doing PNC Aux Portes and Karmix's Khalouni remixed by Claude Challe & Steeve.An absolute must own for the hip, loungy electronic music lovers.SJwww.beatzblog.com"
5,Bohemian Culture At It's Finest,"Paris Lounge is a very very very good CD.CD1 has downtempo cuts from artists like Sporto Kantes, Gotan Project, and Chateau Flight; I think the best track has to be 'Infrarouge' by The Mighty Bop.CD2 has uptempo cuts from artists like Stephane Pompougnac, Bill Is Out, and Kojak; I think the best track has to be 'My Mama Said' by St. Germain. I think that it is interesting that the normally downtempo St. Germain (aka Ludovic Navarre) is chosen as uptempo here, but hey, I wont argue...PARIS LOUNGE is quite hard to find, but if you can find it, enjoy!"
2,"interesting idea, not pulled off well",I bought the CD and it was a bit of a let down... the mixing is not great and the overall sound of the CD is just plain boring.
4,You Won't forget Costes but...,"This is still a solid release. The tracks are pretty nicely selected, and for the price, it's a decent double disc set whereas with other French lounge comps, you pay more for half the material.One thing I did like about this release was that it included a few good and hard to find artists and tracks. For instance, Reminiscence Quartet is a terrific group, and their track featured here isn't on their feature album. The same can be said about Zimpala's track.All in all, I would in fact recommend this. However, I don't think it's at the same quality level through and through as Hotel Costes Etage 3, or La Suite."
3,One Major Flaw,"I have had this easel for almost six years and after awhile when adjusting the height the tray would not hold and my painting crashed to the ground. I often work on two or three paintings at a time and each is a different height so I am constantly readjusting the easel to accommodate the canvas. I was lucky in that my husband adjusted the back metal stress plate (that the knob screwed into) each time and that held for several months.But now the screw is stripped in the adjustment knob and my husband had to gerry rig a new knob for me.This easel was perfect in every way for me, not too big for my 8' ceiling, easy to move about and light weight.However without an easy system for adjusting height it is almost useless...I have learned to only buy easels with a ratchet system for adjustment from now on."
4,I love this Teapot!,Very nice teapot - looks good and keeps the water hot for a while. Perfect size too!
5,Perfect Tea Pot,"As a self-acknowwledged clutz, I seek out utilitarian kitchen tools that are not easily broken, but that doesn't mean I don't want to enjoy looking at the tools I use every day. This tea pot is stainless steel and so safe from my sleepy morning clumsiness, but it also looks great and does the job, both in the kitchen and in the media room, where the evening tea is usually consumed. (We also purchased the 4 cup version, allowing us to make a large, flavorful pot to share, and a smaller pot of medicinal tea, for pain, immune system support, etc.) Highly recommended."
5,I love this game,THIS GAME ROCKS! THE GRAPHICS ARE UNBELIEVABLE! THE GAMEPLAY STAYS FUN AND NEVER GETS BORING! I WOULD DEFINATLY RECCOMEND BUYING IT!
5,"It isn't S. Fielding, it is H. Fielding",Here are two of the premiere writers of 18th century Britain engaging in a literary duel. Both tails are splendidly written and certainly worth reading. Any British lit enthusiast (or any literary enthusiast period) will derive immense pleasure from these two spectacular tails.
5,"Works, especially if applied to feet","Initially I used this product on my children's chests and it worked great on my daughter (2 1/2) but not as great on my son (1 1/2). Plus, my son would wake up crying, get his hands in the rub and then rub his eyes! That could not have felt good. THEN I learned that your feet really soak up whatever's applied to it so instead of putting it on their chests and neck I gooped some on the bottoms of their feet and then covered their feet. The coughing completely disappeared all night. I was warned to be careful when applying this to the bottoms of children's feet because they tend to soak up stuff at a much higher rate than adults (because this is suppose to work on people of all ages!) but I just had to try it after nights of no sleep and coughing. I didn't see any harmful reactions and hope to not see any in the future because it truly works. I will try this on myself next time I'm sick and will continue to buy this product for decades."
5,Awesome product,I love this menthol rub. I've used it since I was young and it works every time I'm starting to feel sick in the chest.
4,Similar to Vicks Vapor rub,"Like the package says, soothing and cooling. I not only found this product to help with breathing while congested, but it helps dry skin become soft. Similar to Vicks, but thicker in consistency and the smell is a tad bit less offensive to me."
4,Great service for good quality,This is product my daughter swears by for the cold and flu season so every year for her BD she gets to cans. Fast shipping is a must because of course I'm the last minute shopper.
5,Best ointment ever!,"I grew up using this ointment and I have never found anything better. It is good on chapped lips, cuts, cuticles, rough patches of skin, rub it on your chest when you have a cold and a thousand other uses. If you run/jog and get rub burns, this will sting a bit when you put it on but then it takes away all of the pain and helps it heal faster."
5,Long Time Watkins Menthol User,"We use Watkins Menthol throughout the year. It helps not only during the cold and flu season, but also during allergy season. Great on stiff muscles and joints. Also helps with dry hands and cracked feet. A must have for our medicine cabinet."
5,Love it,As a child growing up I used this product for everything. As an adult I now use this product on my own children and continue to use it for myself. Love it
3,excellent sound quality poor longevity,"these subs sound amazing and have very good frequency response. they do not hit very hard tho compared to other entry level sub. also, they dont last very long either. have you ever seen a twenty year old pair of mtx subs pound? i have. lots of times.these subs wont do that. you'll be lucky if they last you a year."
5,For both patients/clients and therapists.,"If all of my psychotherapy patients read this book at the start of therapy, I think that treatment would progress faster and go deeper. This is a perfect book for therapists to give to their patients, friends, and families, to promote understanding of just what goes on in the consulting room. One caveat (which Irv acknowledges himself): this book is about patients who are very high functioning. Serious mental illness, suicide, etc. are mentioned only in passing. Young clinicians who unthinkingly apply Dr. Yalom's advice not to use psychiatric diagnoses could find themselves in a lot of trouble when working with a less fortunate patient population."
4,A Good Guide for Young Therapists,"Yalom delivers another good read through The Gift of Therapy. The best part about Yalom's books is that he gives us great examples from actual patients and then offers his own thought process so that we can learn. The biggest thing to pull from this book is his insight into the ""here and now"" though his group therapy book does a much better job of instructing us how to do so. There are some practical tips in the book but it is mostly inspirational than instructional.I do have some problems with the blurred boundaries that Yalom tends to navigate and I am not sure that young therapists (or even seasoned therapists) would have his discernment when it comes to issues such as sexual transference and patient dependence.Overall, it is a good read as it is written well. I would recommend this book to inspire you if you're feeling stuck as a young therapist or if you've found yourself losing the passion you once had as a therapist."
5,A must-read for aspiring therapists,"Wonderfully written. Important and relevant issues faced by all therapists, discussed by one of the field's leaders in interpersonal process-oriented therapy. Essential reading for psychotherapists."
5,Fascinating Read,"This book is a must for anyone who is going into the counseling, psychology or social work fields. Yalom encourages you to break the mold and to trust yourself and the process. The text books teach you the techniques but this book teaches you to be a human while you are in sessions. Something the text books don't know how to explain."
5,First class,"If you're thinking of entering the psychotherapy experience this book will help you develop awareness of what to look for. It will also really help you recognize red flags that will help you run - not walk - from some of the garbage that is being presented as psychotherapy today. However, it is definitely not a cookbook. As a therapist, I found it's premises validating and helpful. It felt good to know that some of my therapy values are shared by someone of Dr. Yalom's stature. I came away thinking that I have been very privileged and fortunate to have had some of the teachers that I've had."
5,A Gift from a Therapist,"As a practicing psychotherapist myself, I have always wanted to know what goes on exactly in the therapy sessions of this field's great practitioners. There is no doubt to all in the field, that Irv Yalom IS one of those great therapists, (as evidenced by the volume of works he has produced and their indisupted impact on the field of therapy on subjects as diverse as Existential Psychotherapy, Group Therapy, the relationships between therapist and patient, treating cancer patients, and Nietzsche). Here at last, it is laid out for me fascinatingly and with great clarity. The humanity and wisdom of this therapist are combined to illustrate how an abundance of life's problems are explored and treated. THis is an excellent guide to therapists and I think would be equally compelling reading to patients as well, in their quest to discover what goes on in the minds of their therapists."
4,The gift of Therapy,"This is a nice little book, truly a gift from Yalom! I am just starting my career in Social Work and appreciate his thoughts."
4,Helpful book.,"This book is great. It gives new insight into therapy and I found it very useful, and well written. I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in the therapeutic process."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I've read all of Yalom's books, and recommended them to doctoral students. This one I will not be recommending. It lacks Yalom's usual eloquence and creativity; worse, it is a poorly-organized summary of basic counseling approaches that folks learn in master's counseling programs. Each ""chapter"" is a mini-essay in which Yalom's stance is tossed out with little of the flair and wisdom we have come to expect. His suggestions for interventions supply nothing beyond his endorsement--no theory and no understanding of which kinds of clients are receptive to which techniques. I know Yalom still has a lot to offer, but it will not be found in this book."
3,"The Gift of Therapy: An Open Letter to a New Generation of Therapists and Their Patients, by Irvin Yalom","The Gift of Therapy: An Open Letter to a New Generation of Therapists and Their Patients by Irvin Yalom..borrowed book from library to preview before i was going to purchase. found simplistic. feel good platitudes. was looking for something more substantial. found book ""in session: the bond between women and their therapists"" to be more what i was looking for. see my review of that book that i posted earlier. great book for anyone in or thinking of entering psychotherapy. ""the gift of therapy"" is a warm & fuzzy kind of read. if that is what you are looking for but if you want something in depth go for ""in sessions"" by deborah a. lott."
5,Phenomenal Assigned Reading!,"I am a graduate student who as assigned this book for a particular course. The author writes from experience and is thoroughly knowledgeable! The short chapters make this text an exceptionally EASY read. The information within the pages is absolutely valuable, practical, and applicable. I recommend this text to any therapist type professional and lay person wanting to gain insight into the world of therapy. By the way, the language is not technical and easy to comprehend."
4,"Anger, Alcoholism, and Addiction",I love this book because anger is one of the most frequent unresolved issues in early recovery that lead people to relapse. This book explain the meaning of anger and it relationship with addiction and recovery and teach us how to deal with a part of our inner self in a constructive way.
5,Exact same product as original,"I needed extra trays for my dehydrator. This is exactly the same product as what came in the box with the dehydrator, so no problems with the fit or look."
4,A good start,"This is a good book when getting started with rolling out CRM. It has a lot of info on making system customizations that help in getting CRM to display exactly what you need. This book doesn't cover everything; so, it's not a be all end all. However, it's worth the money for the info it does cover. It's definitely not a book for end-users, this covers administrative tasks."
5,Peace In The Valley,This is a completely SOULFILLED Elvis legacy! You FEEL Elvis' connection to you with each note!! AWESOME!!!
1,not English,product was received by the date. but the third disc came up Japanesse. I'm an american and expect my stuff to be english.
5,Elvis Sings His Heart and Soul,"You MUST buy this CD box set! You can hear Elvis's sweet, emotional, voice singing to God from the depths of his soul. Gospel music was what Elvis first fell in love with as a child, not 'rock' and it shows on this set. Just try to listen to ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and not get a lump in your throat! And that is just one of many. Elvis's voice was a fantastic musical instrument, will we ever hear another like his? If you love gospel music you must buy this set, you won't be sorry. Even if you don't care to much for this type of music you still should listen to this set to hear a voice unlike any other. I hope Elvis is singing with the angels now because his voice was truly a gift from God."
5,"Great music , Fine performance",Elvis is at his best on these albums singing songs that he apparantly very fond of as he puts his heart and soul into these great old time gospel hits. Your service was prompt and every thing arrived in perfectcondition. Thanks
1,Don't be Fooled,"Most of the songs on these CDs are not Elvis. I have many Elvis LPs from the 60s that still sound better than these. I ran a voice analysis comparision program on these CDs to compare with the original LPs. While it agreed that some were Elvis, is rated over half the songs as ""definately"" not Elvis. Some of the songs sounded like a grade school choir recorded on an old battery powered 3 inch reel to reel recorder. I would not recommend this product to anyone who remembers the real Elvis voice."
1,not quite as serious,"This certianly wasnt his best of best as far as Gospel goes, some of the tracks are crudely recorded and for some reason he laughs during How great thou art."
3,Good 3 CD set for the Price.,There's a lot of Elvis gospel songs in this 3 CD set. Most of the songs are good but some I never heard of and don't like. I love Elvis's spiratualmusic and all his rock-in-roll songs. I play his music in my car when going somewhere. I already have lots of Elvis music but is always looking formore of his music.
3,I purchased this as a gift for my grandfather,My grandfather likes it very much. He just transitioned to cds with his new truck.
2,Peace in the Valley/Elvis,"There are 3 disks in this ""complete gospel"" album. While some are wonderful, many are poor as they were only ""jamming"" sessions and outside of Elvis' vocal range. I'm glad I didn't buy the recording and pay full price."
5,Great gospel album!,"I have always thought that Elvis' voice was never better than when he was singing gospel and this album proves it! Well done remastering, clear, very good sound. Absolutely a must for people who love gospel and Elvis!!"
4,"A good complement to Elvis' ""Amazing Grace"" CD","This is a good complement to the CD ""Amazing Grace"" Elvis' Greatest Sacred Performances. Many of the songs are the same, though Peace in the Valley has many older performances on CD #3. There are quite a few songs from the ""Million Dollar Quartet"" session in 12/4/1956 with Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins."
5,"If it wasn't for gospel music, we wouldn't have the king!","This is, in my opinion, the most beautiful Elvis box set I have ever purchessed in my life. This three CD set features every single gospel recording Elvis ever made and in my opinion his 1960 album His Hand In Mine is the greatest ever. It will bring you to tears when you hear him sing Known Only To Him, He Knows Just What I Need and I Believe In The Man In The Sky. Elvis sounded so good singing these songs and for some reason Crying In The Chappel didn't show up on the album. However it was released as a single in 1965 and it is truly one of the greatest. This is a great set for not only Elvis fans, but true gospel fans also. God bless BMG for this graet set."
5,Loving Elvis Gospel!,Ordered two - one for myself and one for a friend. Lots of songs on the 3 CDs and the quality of the music is exceptional.
4,GOOD listening,IT's not as good as How Great Thou Art but there's some great songs on it. I'm glad I bought H G T A too
5,Baby Gift,"I saw this book, opened it and knew it would be prefect for one of my dear friends who is newly pregnant with her first baby. It is such a beautiful book and makes such a nice gift. My friend loved the book."
4,surprisingly effective for an OTC,"This stuff just works for me and my minor allergies; both as a preventative and a reliever. It's becoming hard to find in retail (I think Walmart and Walgreens are the only two places I've found it), so this is handy for me."
5,Good product - defective sprayer,"I have used NasalCrom for 15+ years with good results, but this year, on two occasions I have purcased defective sprayers. The tube from the sprayer to the bottom of the bottle was broken and did not reach the liquid. I suggest opening the bottle and checking the sprayer before you need to use the product."
5,Finally I can breathe,"I read about this product in an online article about remedies for labored breathing while running. I have been having problems with that for a while and could find no over-the-counter drug without side effects. I was becoming addicted to nasal spray antihistamine and was desperate for another solution. This product has been amazing for me -- I have been using it for a few weeks now and only use on an as-needed basis, which is not even daily. I notice no side effects at all."
4,Non Steroidal,"Works well for me. I use Advair for my COPD everyday and it is a steriod,NasalCrom is non sterodial and doens't make you sleepy.I really think a spray up each nostril before going around large crowds may prevent some airbore germs from being inhaled,"
1,Didn't work for me,"Just have to be honest here...I suffer from nasal congestion, and I've tried this for 4-6 weeks. Didn't work for me. I really wish it did, though."
2,Anti-allergy Nasal Spray,"Frankly, after 5 weeks of use, I could not tell if it worked or not. At least there were no side effects."
4,this stuff works,"I've had hay fever allergies from age nine, and I'm now over 50. After an endless stream of antihistamines and decongestants, I got advice from my physician to get this stuff over the counter. I use it twice a day after a lot of saline spray, as a continual routine. Until I did this I pretty much thought some level of congestion was unavoidable. During the day I may also use the saline spray, but I'm free of sinus headaches and general drowsiness that comes with antihistamines. In the season of grass pollens, I still use antihistamines, but even then I'm way better off with this. Don't even try the homeopathic snakeoil ""zicam"", completely useless."
5,If you like-a-tha sub city...,"I've grown a great respesct for Sub City as of late... they're one of the few record labels out there that aren't about just making muisc. making music is great, but making it with a purpose is even better. If you thought you'd get a better circle of musicians together, you were wrong when you bought this comp. It's not the BEST Sub City take action comp, but it features so many good bands that if you never heard the original Take Action compilation you'd have thought so. This compilation single-handedly turned me back to punk rock, and even though it's a little poppier than my original punk tastes, it gave me a broader view of what good punk can be. And this is good punk rock."
2,The light button does not work properly,"Marineland Eclipse Aquarium Hood System 6This is the second time I have had to replace my hood. Each time it has been because the on-off button for the light to turn on will not work. The button seems to slip into nowhere land. The new one does not work properly either. It seems to stick. Now that it is on, (after many attempts) I am keeping it on."
1,This hood is hopelessly flawed in design and function...,"I've had three of these hoods go belly up. The first stopped working altogether and the other two would give off only the slightest amount of light over time. The design is extremely poor as there should be a hinged lid in front instead of the back for feeding purposes and because the Eclipse six is curved, no other hood will fit but this one. There is no protection against moisture getting into the ballast and causing a short. The next I buy will be protected with plastic wrap so the water can't get into the light mechanism. Live and learn. It's taken until the fourth hood to figure this out. I would give this product zero stars if it were possible. Stay away from the Eclipse six altogether if at all possible!"
5,super sturdy very stable,ladder is very sturdy and stable. the extended frame rails add gripping points for those of us who need to keep steady when on a stool. this ladder provides a large platform to maintain balance and dosen't move when you are on it. i do not recommend it for everybody but i removed the top bar so i could stand in the middle for better balance. it did not hurt the strength or stability in the least. i really feel secure on this product more than standing on a cheaper hardware store item.
1,I found it annoying!,"Of course the Three Billygoats Gruff is a classic folktale. But this version is very annoying. The Caribbean accent, dialect, wording, etc. was odd and unnatural to me. I just couldn't get into it. After trying the first time through, I found my self just ""translating"" it when reading it subsequently. It was not an enjoyable read and I can't wait to get it back to the library."
2,Not as good as 6 AM...,"I searched this rock musician after I wanted to hear more from Nikki Sixx and 6 AM. Yes, he is the vocalist. But this kinda sucks...Let's hope we hear more from him. And hope it's better than this..."
5,Excellent quality and well priced,"I unfortunately go through many of these handles due to the abusive environment and locations my businesses are located. Other flush levers that I pay more than double for at local hardware stores do not last nearly as long. Great product. I received double order. When I contacted seller to return the second, I was told to keep at no charge. Thanks for not wasting my time in return shipping."
5,A Rising Star In The World of Fiction!,"I had the pleasure to read ""The Rainbow Man & Other Stories"" recently and from beggining to end each story was compelling & unique. This author engages a readers mind & leaves them with a perception of the world they didn't have before. David Gardiner is a gifted writer with a storytellers heart! His stories will shock you, other times make you laugh, always make you think but most of all they will take you out of your head and throughly entertain you! In short ""The Rainbow Man"" is a fantastic read I'm sure you will enjoy, I did! I recommend this collection without reservation.Robert Anthony MontesinoEditorSpeculative Fiction CentreAuthor of ""Mind Monsters Collection"""
5,Clearly the best work yet concerning Norwich,"Finally, there is an engrossing, well-documented work concerning Norwich University. This is ""By the Blood of our Alumni,"" by Robert Poirier. Previously, all that was available on the subject were the official history of Norwich by William Arba Ellis (volumes 1-3) and Robert Darius Guinn (volume 4), all of which read like an expanded admissions pamphlet; or the pretentious garbage that W.E.B. Griffin spews forth. One can only hope that Poirier will delve further into the military history of Norwich; which has for too long been kept out of the limelight."
2,Blood of Our Alumni is dull reading,"Blood of our Alumni, filled with facts on Norwich University Civil War history, is plodding reading. The author simply lacks the writing skills necessary to make history exciting. Also, the books is short on information about the university's men who served in Confederate ranks. This is a good book to take to bed late at night, if you can't sleep. Soon you will be snoring."
4,Works fine and the price is right.,"We don't drive in an area where smog fumes are prevalent so a charcoal filter was an unnecessary expense. This filter was adequate.The included installation instructions were adequate but not exceptional. If you don't have a bit of mechanical aptitude, you should probably let someone else install it for you.Unlike the original, this filter is not air-flow specific. It can be put in either side up and work just fine. If you switch back to a directional filter in the future, you will need to remember the orientation or figure out which way the air passes through the system."
1,Highly avoidable,It is a completely unreliable book. Two of the most highly rated places (* places) turned out to be total fiascos. They rated a place- a luxury upscale B&B 'The Dairy' in Queenstown as highly recommended. It was expensive by NZ standards and turned out to be worse than any cheap motel I have stayed in USA. The restaurant recommendations were similarly unreliable. In fact the only two really unpleasant experiences we had in the whole trip were based on the sole recommendations of this guide.
1,The worst travel guide ever,"All the information you don't want is there. The guide, if I can call it that, is targeted to someone who is already on a guided trip so no useful information is necessary. Too much of her opinion, instead of raw fact. There have to be better guides to such a wonderful country."
4,Frommers,Great book. Very informative. I've planned a 3 week trip there and now have all of the needed reservations made.
4,Frommer's New Zealand,"An excellent planning guide, especially the tips about school holidays and how to avoid the crowds."
3,Are these reviews really for 2nd edition?,I'm curious that many of the negative reviews were written before this was published?!?! (were they based on a 1st edition?)
5,Good insights from a native,"I thought this book had good coverage of the major locations most Americans would visit in New Zealand. More importantly, the author is a native of NZ and as such, she seemed to have some good insights into the local viewpoint. I had no difficulty finding the information I needed about every location we wanted to visit and every major hotel or restaurant that interested us. This book is probably not well suited to those who want to backpack through NZ on the cheap. It's aimed at the middle-class traveler who wants to stay in an actual hotel and eat in restaurants."
1,"I Don't Need Hotel Recommndations at $1,000+ Per Night","I picked up the 2006 edition and since I always plan parts of my trips abroad by selecting nice accomodations in an area of interest, I turned to the pages at the beginning on ""Best Boutique Hotels and Small Lodges,"" ""Best B&Bs;"" and ""Best Luxury Accomodations) on pp. 12-15. ""Luxury"" apparently is Bill Gates or Warren Buffet luxury to Frommer, with rates around US $1,500 per night and some up to $7,000. I had to check to find whether these might be weekly rates, but they are PER NIGHT. Many of the B&Bs; were US $300-$500/night, and none under around $150. Most of the boutique hotles were US $500-$700/night.We are fairly affluent travelers, but these prices were so discouraging we wondered whether we even ought to be considering a trip to New Zealand. We don't pay such prices in the USA. Fortunately, prices elsewhere are not nearly so high, I just wish Frommer's could define ""best"" in a way that is more like ""best value"""
5,Hard to Find,"I think this would be easier to find an audience if if was labled properly. I found it the first time when I was about 11 or 12 at my local library just browsing the stacks. I loved it. Almost 30yrs later I can still remember how profoundly I was affected by these little creatures. I remember trying to read the sequels, but I don't really remember them. It was the first book that did it for me. I re-read it a few times since then, and I always have a hard time finding it. My library has moved it around departments and now it resides in the childrens books section, where it doesn't belong.Very few books draw me back again and again but this is one of them. It is epic and very much like Watership Down, but I never really cared so much about those characters.I have tried in vain to suggest this book to other people. As soon as the words, ""its about these moles"", is out, noone listens. People shouldn't be so ignorant."
5,magic,"having read the trillogy of Duncton Wood i have to say i was almost ruined from ever reading another book, they were almost magical in contex and pros.READ THESE BOOKS and live the ansewers that they bring if only we were moles"
5,A Wonderful Book!,"I read this book when I was 11, in Hebrew of all languages. My dad recommended it to me, but I couldn't get hold of a copy in English. So I started reading it in a language I could scarcely speak. It took me five minutes to stumble through each page, but the story was so gripping that I persevered. I found myself completely entangled in a new world, which I practically lived in for the two months it took me read the book. I laughed and cried and stayed up all night reading, and at one point I even had to stop reading for a week to get over something particularly terrible that happened. I don't have the words to describe the book properly - it is a mix of adventure, and love, and nature, and epic adventure, and a dash of spirituality, and some kind of quality x that makes it one of the most memorable books I have ever read... Anyway, I was overjoyed to learn that there are five more books about Duncton Wood, and I plan to read them all as soon as I can find English copies!"
5,Up there with LOTR and WoT,"I first read this series 25 years ago. I was twelve and had just finished ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"". At the time I rated this book as better than those classics - and I devoured all the Duncton books I could find.Now, 25 years later, I decided to read it again. I remember loving it back then, but thought it was just because I was a kid. But, wow! After all these years I love it even more. This might sound incredible, but this story about moles(!!) is right up there with The Wheel of Time as my all time favorite. I'd rate it as better than Mistborn.Do yourself a favor and get this."
5,Get to know yourself.....,"Without submitting to a sappy, cliche-like review, I would like to voice a review that will possibly encourage everyone to read this fantastic novel. Adventure for the venturesome, romance for the hopeless, encouragement for the despairing, and overall, wisdom for the ignorant....you learn how to know yourself through this novel. With all the elements a fantasy novel possesses, Duncton Wood offers more. If you are a male, undoubtedly you will place yourself in the ""paws"" of Bracken, the heroic mole that bears more human-like strenghts and faults than any fictional character I have read about, human or not. The ladies will, with certainty, get lost in the Rebecca's (the mole heroine) world as she eminates every good and true quality everyone desires.Haywood has eloquent prose ornamented with a splendid vocabulary, but he has an even more keener understanding of the human condition. Get the book, read it and love it."
1,Waste of money.,"I also thought I'd be able to ""create my own recipe library"" just like it says on the box. You can only enter ten recipes since this is not a ""fully functional version."" All you're really getting are pretty recipe cards. Since there's no print preview function, you have to print long recipes first on blank paper to see if you need to adjust the fonts to get it on one page. I think it's a total waste of money."
2,Conned,I thought I could write a family cookbook with this software and it only allowed me to enter 10 recipes before it maxed out. I need to order another software to capture my family's recipes.
1,Demo Product - Beware!!!,"The description provided on the website for this product is misleading. I purchased this product and was excited to type in my recipies. After typing in only 5 recipies I was informed that the software was only a demo and I would need to purchase additional software for $30 to store my recipies. When you purchase this product, beware that you are only purchasing printable recipe cards, NOT the software to type in your own."
3,Based on what I read here I went elsewhere.,"I wound up going with Matilda's Fantastic Cookbook Software, found here:Matilda's Fantastic Cookbook Software 3.1Does basically the same thing but there's no limit to the number of recipe cards. And you can print full size cookbooks too."
3,OK Album -- mostly Screwed Up versions,"Out of the 14 songs on here, only 3 of them aren't Screwed Up versions. Me not being a huge fan of this so I don't like the album as much as someone who likes that type of music will. I do prefer his ""U Gotta Feel Me"" and his classic ""Undaground Legend"" much more then this one. I do like the 3 not Screwed Up songs very much (#'s 1, 4, and 5). Guests are plentiful (Lil Keke, SHB, Lil Ron, Big Shasta, Flak, Will-Lean) and are on almost every song. A good album to have for his fans and fans of Screwed up music."
5,Great Reading -- Alien Encounters: The Deception Menace,"Very interesting, containing many encounters and insights I had not heard or seen before. I am a skeptic, but James Thompson's book gives me something to think about. If people really are having encounters, it's not as innocuous as I thought before."
4,great stuff,"After reading the other reviews, I thought the writers must have watched a different video.Annie Duke is the best poker teacher there is. Her online game advice is no different. She gives specific advice about how to use and play each differnet type of online holdem game. She explains why you must play online tournaments in a completely different syle from the online cash games. Rather than give complicated math, she explains in simple language the mathmatical concepts that require the radically different styles of play for online cash games and online tournaments.The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that she sort of skipped over what to do in sit and go tornaments, just commenting that the basic strategy was the same as a final table, and that accordingly this was great practice for a final table in a regular taornament. That begs the question of what is correct final table play.However, for anyone planning to win at Holdem online this is a must video."
4,Easier drying,These prevent the food from sticking to the trays making drying easier and clean-up faster. Am very pleased with.
2,Re: Nesco Dehydrator Screens,"After using these screens just one time, they warped! I can still use them; however I am hoping that with a few more uses they are still functional."
3,mesh sheets,Firstly they were a great price compared to anything else on the market.However when I received them they were different than I was expecting. They don't fit the FD 1000 perfectly (a bit short around the edges). And the edges are a solid rim instead of flat edges.I think I confused them with the Ezidry Ultra mesh sheets which I would have preffered. They look the same in the pictures.
3,Unexpectedly folded,"I received these folded in half in a large brown envelope. Just folded them the other direction & put a weight on them for a few days. I had expected these to be shipped flat from the business, but the purchase price was lower than from the manufacturer. I previously had ordered from the manufacturer & those screens were shipped flat, but they were also a little bit more expensive. Trade offs I suppose. The product itself is a huge lifesaver from cleaning the trays themselves."
3,"Mesh Dehydrator Screens, Set of 2",The items were packaged in too small of a plastic bag and arrived bent. It took several days to flatten them out but they are still a little bent. They worked anyway but I hope with repeated use they will eventually be completely flat.
4,Bought these to replace my misplaced old ones. These are sturdier than the old.,"Bought these to replace my misplaced old ones. These are sturdier than the old.Two days after receiving these, I found the old ones. Oh well. These will come in handy for dehydrating around this prepper's house."
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"I took the SAP team academy and after reading all the positive reviews about this book decided to order it. Huge mistake, it is an awful book, poorly written, badly organized and I cannot see how it can help someone pass the certification exam. If you want to become certified you either need a lot of experience on field or attend a SAP Academy, this book is not the way to get it. I found it a bad book from the moment I got it, but I wanted to take the exam first to make sure if it would be of any help. It is not. I passed the exam, but not because of this book."
1,Don't waste your money on this,I don't understand how anyone can praise this book. I would not be surprised if the author himself actually posted the rave reviews there are. This book is definitely not worth the paper printed on. It's poorly written and has little to do with the actual certification exam.
1,A book for sales people who like to sell air,"This book is full of general and superficial information, which is good to use at receptions or for sales people. The questions are of the same style. Texts include many mistakes. The book did not help me at all, or was it to give me a good feeling of confidence that I knew everything already? Do not buy it, you can buy mine! Sorry that ""No stars"" was not available"
1,Worthless Material for the Garbage,"I am a certified Consultant with 5 years of experience in the field of SAP and I must say that this book is the most worthless material I have ever seen. And one word to the SAP contacts at the SAP Department, who are supposed to help you.I know SAP in Walldorf quite good and they would never give out contact details in that form. Furthermore I hope that no one wants to humilate himself by getting in contact with SAP and refer to that garb. Book."
5,Worth the Money!,"After having reviewed this book carefully, I have come to the conclusion that it is definately worth the money! I am highly impressed with its suject matter and found the information to be very valuable. I do not understand, however, how anyone could return a book like this the next day. I feel that since there are no other books like this on the market, some people are trying to knock what they obviously don't understand. I *DO* understand SAP, and if you want to buy a book that will really help you get involved with SAP Certification--then you will find this book well worth your time and money."
1,Most Useless SAP Book I've Ever Seen,"I bought this book to serve as a good general overview of the SAP modules for some co-workers who are new to SAP. It fails to do that, and I would have certainly been in trouble if I had needed this as a certification study guide.The book lacks clarity, is repetitious, and has many grammatical errors."
1,A dud. Don't waste your time OR your money.,"There's probably a lot of good stuff in this book. Which is too bad, because it's BURIED in repetition, circuitous writing, misplaced section headings, and bad grammar. Example: ""An event-handling method may be registered for the events of a single object, multiple individual objects, all instances of a class, or all instances that implement a certain interface. This method may be registered for the events of a single object, multiple individual objects, all instances of a class. or all instances that implement a certain interface."" The ""sample questions"" are nothing more than yet another repetition of the text. It looks like somebody was getting paid by the word. A good editor could probably cut AT LEAST 100 pages out of this book and make it useful. Don't waste your time OR your money."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,This book claims to have certification tips and questions.Truth is it does not. I donated the book to a guy in a training session as he was planning to buy one. I am glad i got rid of the book. The guy to whom i donated passed the donation to another prospective buyer. The best source for certification questions would be sites like sapfans where you can get much more help for certification and FREE!!!
1,A tree died for this?,"I guess someone could give this book a five-star review if they were the author of the book, or clueless. I suggest you save your money. Having just completed three certifications, I can assure you that the best path to certification is the SAP Academy. This book, contrary to it's claims, isn't any help with the academy courses. If you can't afford the academy, order SAP's online help CD, and study based on the SAP Application Consultant Certification Program white paper. There isn't any super easy way to study for any of these tests, so don't waste this much money on this superficial book."
1,Certainly NOT for SAP Certification,"I am very disappointed about this book's presentation. The book is about SAP Certification, but nothing for the real SAP certification. All the questions have long-wasted english sentances. If this is the sample of SAP certification, then we need 1 week to complete the exam. It is USELESS MATERIAL."
1,"Simply stated, this book is a fraud!","I bought this book when it first came out and was I was excited when I bought this book because I believed it would help me towards Basis certification. Well, there is nothing in here for Basis Admins. In addition, he tries to present information for every function module in 700+ pages. Each function module by itself would take 700+ pages for certification preparation. Extremely superficial treatment of SAP function modules."
1,A Gimmick to make money,If I was to give a 4 or 5 star review for this book I would not blame you for thinking I was either the author's friend or else an extreme beginner (naive) in SAP. This book is superficial at best.
2,Too Brief,"This book only provides an overview of what SAP can do. There is no way you could depend on this book for SAP certification. Overall, the book is not too useful."
1,Not worth the money nor the name of Mcgrawhill,"First, this book does not feature questions as per the format of SAP Certification.It appears that the author has read the on-line documentation and/or the SAP marketing literature and framed the questions. The trouble of importing it from USA was like wasting money drown the drain. The tips given by the instructor on the possible areas for Certification Questions were the only useful ones. If any one is expecting that this book will serve as a guide for the exam, sure enough it does. It makes sure you fail."
1,It is a waste of money and waste of time!,"I waited for a while for this book. It really disappoints me. I am working on PP module, for instance. This book only talks about PP in no more than 15 pages?! It is just a abstract. Not enough example. The worst is that it is published in such a hurry that there are tons of mistakes. I suspects the author did not edit it at all before publishing it. It gives reader wrong direction. I believe we will never depend on this book for SAP certification."
1,Dissapointment,"Where are the multiple choice questions? Certainly not on the included CD. It has some high level information, but nothing that would help you become certified in one of the complicated modules. Where is the section for Technical Certification.What a Dissapointment"
2,Very helpful for those who intend to study SAP R/3 modules,"I waited for 3 months for this book to arrive at my doorstep. I was expecting that this would contain detailed questions similar to certification exam which most SAP R/3 CBT has. I find the questions very general and more for job interview type of questions. Nevertheless, this book will give you overview of SAP modules and is a very good guide before studying in any track of your choice. The CD which is included has no use at all. The title of the book is misleading. It should have been , ""Guide for SAP R/3 Certification Study""."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"H.P. Lovecraft was one of the bands that got a lot of FM play in San Francisco in the late late '60s. I remember being enchanted by ""the White Ship"" ... I listen to it again after all these years, yeah it brings back memories, but you know, HP was just not as good a band as the ones that made it, Like Quicksilver, the Dead, Big Brother, etc etc. I'll probably pick up the Mad River reissue CD and feel the same way."
2,East Coast & the 60s,"Aside from White Ships and C'mon People now, a bore. A really big time bore! had to listen to about 300 hours of Quicksilver, Love and even the Chambers Brothers to get the grunge out of my ears."
4,H.P. Lovecraft-'H.P.Lovecraft/H.P.Lovecraft II'(Collector's),"Another one of those fabulous 2 lp's-on-1 CD releases.This Collector's Choice pressing combines the two lp's that the band had ever put out,their self-titled debut('67) and it's full-hearted follow-up 'H.P.Lovecraft II'('68) plus two bonus cuts,bringing the duration of the disc to over seventy minutes.I would best describe H.P.Lovecraft as complex psych with some elements of folk,pop and jazz clearly intact.Heard they opened for Pink Floyd once at the Fillmore East.I mean,how cool is that?Might appeal to fans of the Seeds,Tomorrow,Chocolate Watchband,13th Floor Elevators and the Electric Prunes.Nice to pull out from time to time to give the CD a spin."
4,"""WHITE SHIP"" Alone Worth The Purchase","HP LOVECRAFT named after the classic neo-gothic writer, was comprised of a central quintet George Edwards, Dave Michaels and Tony Cavallari. Although the group never reached permanent superstar status, they became something of a cult favorite of the folk-rock psychedelic milieu (with an emphasis on psychedelic.) Their male duets were exceptional and their music demonstrated crosscurrents with The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. Some of their tunes are uncannily remind the listener of today's Radio Head. The selection is a double CD on one and the song The White Ship inspired by the original H.P. Lovecraft's use of opium is well worth the discounted price of the CD. The White Ship is on a counter-culture pare with White Rabbit and a brilliant piece of musical construction.Surrealistic Pillow"
4,a weird trip into a trance of something....,this cd is pretty cool. kendall has an unique sound. the beats are good and it sounds like something good. i heard he used to be on MTV. i wonder why he isn't anymore? anyways if you like this cd get Root Beer by Jimmy Somerville too.
3,O.K.,"Yes, this dvd has no menu or chapters, yes it's short. But it does have good quality footage of some very good performances including Sara Hughes' complete short and long program from 2002. If you know what you're doing you can split the video yourself; I was able to do it with Magic dvd copier and Handbrake. Considering that this video is currently going for under ten dollars, I think it's worth it."
3,Another compilation,"This is a collection of previously released material. I found only disc 2 of this. All but the studio version of ""Journey"" on that half appear on ""Almost Live in Europe"". The tracks on Disc 1 I have on other CDs anyway, so I have it vicariously. This wasn't listed on Rick Wakeman's official site, as it may be a creation of the record company (as the site told me), as he hasn't had the best luck with those! Then there's the cover is a poor man's version of Roger Dean! For completists only!"
5,Love Among the Ruins,"Sophie and Ben is a love story but also a story of sturggle, hardships, triumphs, and unity of family. Helen Nardecchia has used her enourmous talent to tell the story of he parens-in-law and how they came to this country, made a family and made a life for themselves. Helen's sensitive nature to her mother-in-law tells Sophie's story without Helen telling her story. This ""telling to another person"" works in this case and I think it did becasue of Helen's admiration and love for her mother-in-law.It is an inspiring and loving story , one I think everyone would benefit from reading. Jan Guest, Round Rock, Texas"
4,More than just another Teens awareness guide!,"Girl In A Mirror goes beyond providing solutions to today's teenage girl on how to manage and conduct theirselves as young ladies.

I am going to incorporate the excercises from this book into some of my mini lessons with my youngsters. I know they will benefit from the lessons tremendously. Great job Ms. Crittendon. I look forward to reading your future literary works.Adra YoungAuthor of: The Everyday Living of Children & Teens Monologues"
5,Works well for seasonal allergies,"This is really great and has helped keep the allergies at bay. Also, makes it so I do need the sudafed at all."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I have used NasalCrom for several years. As a singer, it doesn't cause dry throat, yet it relieves nasal decongestion, quickly. It may take a few days before it starts working really well. Amazon has the best price of all on-line sellers. This is a double win. Chris"
3,"Well, this is allergy season and every year ...","Well, this is allergy season and every year I make the trip to my doctor for something to help with all the bad effects. But not this time. I tried the NasalCrom and couldn't believe how great I felt for about six to eight hours. No runny nose, no scratchy eyes. I'd definitely purchase this product to have in my medicine cabinet--especially during spring."
4,Rekindles the memories,"Back before free agency, teams stayed together long enough to develop a healthy hatred for their rivals, and no two teams hated each other more than the Redskins and Cowboys. This book does a great job of capturing the feeling of the rivalry, covering some of forgotten classics in the series as well as a number of the best known games."
2,WONT LAST,"I RECIEVED THE ITEM AND FOUND IT VERY NICE, FOR THE FIRST DAY WHICH IS THE ONLY TIME IT WORKED!! I EMAILED THE SELLER AND THEY DIDNT EMAIL ME BACK!! THEYRE MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE STORE BUT YOU GET WHAT U PAY FOR."
2,Poor Design,"Great idea, poor design. This product broke within 6 months of purchase.It makes a great fog effect, but as others have mentioned water flies everywhere. When it first stopped, I purchased the replacement ""membrane"" and it worked for about 3 days and stopped again. I've cleaned it numerous times in diluted vinegar, and it still doesn't work.Rather worthless at the moment, I wouldn't recommend this product, look at the other product out on the market."
5,fogging fogger!,"When I first got my terrarium, I knew I had to have a great focal point. So naturally, I got the medium waterfall and was please that it had a fogger option. Amazon.com to the rescue! I purchased the Mini Fogger unit, received it in 2 days and finished setting up my terrarium. I LOVE IT! My terrarium is setup in the main entry way so when I have guests over they all notice the terrarium with the fog rolling out of the water fall. PLUS, it definitely helps keep the humidity up and my snakes have a natural like habitat they enjoy. :) However, there is a small downside. Because the water here is hard water full of mineral deposits, I did have to change the ceramic piece (the fog maker piece) rather soon. I started using filter water and am hoping it will last longer than 8+ hrs/day for a month. I would still recommend this product."
1,Absolute Piece of CRAP!,"I wanted this for my Exo Terra waterfallExo Terra Natural Waterfall with Pump - Medium. The waterfall has a built in place for this to sit perfectly to get the right amount of water to produce the right amount of fog. When it worked, it was AWESOME! My terrarium looked amazing!But as everyone else said... it does. I had it for 2 days and all of a sudden... no more fog.I don't know if it is where Amazon gets their supply or if the product simply sucks... either way, mine died."
2,Keep your vinegar handy!,"A reviewer at another site recommended soaking this fogger in vinegar or a vinegar/water solution once a week, as the diaphragm on the Exo-Terra tends to get mucky pretty quickly otherwise.If I'd known that before, or that my frogs would so enjoy climbing all over the blasted thing, I'd have gone with a less fragile brand."
1,Dont waste your money,I bought this for my water dragon it worked for two days and then quit. It is a complete waste of money.
5,"Great fogger, works perfect","Length:: 0:10 MinsThis is a quick vid of my setup, With the Exo-Terra fogger running while my chinese water dragon sleeps. It works great, and needs around 2 inches of water to work properly. I'm not sure why people here are having issues...maybe badluck...But it works great, gets the humidty up to 100%..My Lee (lizard) loves it."
5,Great!!!,"I have used this item several times for making fruit roll ups and other things for my sons backpacking trips and it is great to have around. I would have liked to have seen the ceter hole measurment on the description because I had to rely on a review to tell me it was 3 inches, which was what I needed."
5,Great for making Kale Chips,"I've not used these for fruit roll ups, but can attest to wonderful kale chips in just a few hours of dehydrating. Wash and dry a large bunch of Kale. Break into pieces like a salad then drizzle (about 1Tb) with olive oil. Really massage it into the greens (it takes about 5 full minutes). Then add any seasonings you want. A dash or two of vinegar (apple cider, balsamic, any kind), S or P, onion powder, garlic powder. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, nutritional yeast, or red pepper flakes-whatever suits your buds. Spread on the sheets, dehydrate on low (about 115 F) to retain the most nutrients and check in about 4 hours. You want them crisp like potato chips. If they are still a bit chewy, keep them in there longer. A delicious, satisfying, and totally nutritious snack. My 7 year old loves them!Happy snacking!"
5,Great Buy,Made fruit rollups with the Grandkids...they enjoyed making the fruit rollups and eating them. Good investment...I would recommend to anyone
2,Charged $6.33 When Roll Sheets Are On Sale for $3.99,"Nesco American Harvest 2-PK. Fruit Roll Sheets for FD-27 & FD-50 are and were advertised at a reduced price for $3,99, but I was charged $6.33. I still want to try the product; however, I am doubtful of quality and dependability now. What happened?Nesco American Harvest Fruit Roll Sheets for FD-27 & FD-50."
4,"Might not have purchased had I know, but they are good","Don't really use this, but thought I would, but they seem to be very handy and good quality. I will probably use them in the future."
1,Expensive shipping,"I ordered this item,not realizing the cost for shipping. It is confusing for me when I use Amazon, sometimes the window closes before I know what I have agreed to pay.Just after ordering I looked up the transaction and was shocked to see the charge for shipping for this item. I immediately canceled the order, the item wasn't worth that much to me.Even tho I had canceled the order, they sent it anyway and I was charged for the shipping. Be careful when you order on Amazon, its easy for the order to be completed before you review the ""hidden costs""."
3,Warped fruit leather sheets,"After a month of use, the fruit leather sheets warped so badly that my leather is now almost as thin as a sheet of paper but thicker around the edges. By the time the edges are dried, the middle is crispy. The sheets bow upward in the middle limiting the amount of liquid that can be poured onto the sheet. I dehydrate at about 120 degrees most of the time butNesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydratorsometimes lower and never higher.Otherwise, the dehydrator is great. Hopefully, American Harvest will rectify this."
5,Hard to find,"Walmart doesn't even carry these anymore. If you dehydrate, these are a must for fruit roll ups..Work great. Food doesn't stick to them."
2,eh,"This product seemed as if it would be awesome. I beg to differ. I bought these thinking that I would make organic, fresh fruit roll ups for my kids. These didn't work. It was a waste of money and I wouldve returned the product if hadn't missed the return window."
5,What can I say...they are fruit roll trays...,The product is what it says it is...fruit roll trays. They work but how could they not? I suppose I could talk about the smoothness of them and how much they resemble the original one I bought with my product...but...they are great.
5,As advertised,"Not much I can say except that it fits perfectly in my dehydrator. It is simple to insert, very easy to clean, and my treats come out perfectly."
2,Not so good.,"These trays are meant to make fruit roll-ups on. You take applesauce as a base and add what ever fruit excites you to it and then spread it thinly onto the sheets. First you have to spray them with Pam though. Why aren't they silicone so you don't end up with slimy, oily fruit roll-ups? The edges of the roll-ups get hard as a rock while the centers stay pliable. The instructions even admit this and tell you to get used to it!Once thing that does irritate me is the fact that the Nesco dehydrator is designed for 7 shelves so why in the world do the sell these things in sets of 2?????? Why not 7? If you are going to dry something and use electricity efficiently, you want to use all the shelves, not 2 or 4 of them. Sure, you can buy 4 sets and then throw one tray away."
2,Not like the original... they warp!,"When I got my dehydrator, it came with one fruit roll sheet. I ordered another package of sheets but was deeply disappointed with what I got.Yes, they are the same shape and size as the original, but they are made of a heavier plastic that warps! I have never had a problem with my original sheet warping, but all of the extra sheets I ordered warped on their first run in the dehydrator.These sheets are difficult to use because the liquids I put on them for dehydration run down into the low spots and I cannot get a nice uniform dried fruit rolls the way I can with the original sheet that came with the dehydrator."
4,Nesco Fruit Roll Sheets.,"These are so handy as I make jelly on them. However, they aren't as heavy as the ones that came w/my machine, but they will do. That is why they didn't get 5 stars."
4,Works well for making crackers,The rolls were easy to use and just what I needed for making dehydrated crackers. That and an easy cleanup and I'm a happy customer.
3,Fruit sheets,"Item doesn't fit my American Harvest as stated it would, however I was able to make it work with little problem."
3,Complete Clyde McCoy On Columbia,"I've always had a soft spot for The Big Band Era, especially the 1920's and 30's. I grew up listening to my dad's and grandfather's old 78's before Rock n'Roll hit the scene, however, sometimes when you have heard the original recordings, it's difficult to get in tune with an alternate. Please note that there are a few exceptions to the rule, even though these were the first recordings of Clyde McCoy on Columbia, it definitely lacks the more energetic toe-tapping songs done for Decca. The CD here represents the artists' first recordings and are done quite well! However, some day Decca/MCA will release the others, and until then....this is it!"
5,Awesome,"Great affordable fountain pen. I was worried that the EF nib would skip, but it doesn't, writes incredibly smoothly, fits great in the hand, affordable quality."
2,"Nice pen, scratchy nib","I like the design and feel of the Lamy Safari a lot. Unfortunately, the ink flow is inconsistent and the EF nib very scratchy. I am not sure if the problem was a bad nib--something some customers complain about--or the fact that I am left-handed."
4,Good Pen,"One of my first fountain pens. I really like the look (charcoal) and feel of the pen. It has a modern look to an old style pen. The extra fine nib is pretty good. I wish it was even finer. I would not recommend a bigger nib if you are looking to write small. For the most part it writes consistently. Sometimes cuts out when I'm writing but doesn't happen too often. Overall, a good starter fountain pen."
4,Nice Writing Instrument,I use the Lamy fountain pen every day. It has a nice feel in my hand and writes smoothly.
2,"Eh, could be better.","It's a fine line, which I expected, but the ink doesn't flow properly, skips a lot, dries up quickly, and overall doesn't write very well. I have to write twice in one spot just to read what I've written."
1,"The geology might be okay, but I have never seen a less diverse ""cast"".","I'm a female geology professor, and I watched this with my partner, who is a male geologist. We were both struck and horrified by the total lack of non-white men in this documentary. They show one woman in the whole thing, and have her find a not-interesting rock. I would never show this in a classroom, as it makes absolutely no effort to portray science as done by anyone other than old white men. There's plenty of well-qualified women in the field working on these topics, and it was offensively neglectful for the directors for this film not to incorporate a single one of them.When your lack of diversity is the most striking aspect of your documentary (and I'm an easy sell-I love geology), then you are doing something very wrong."
2,Good graphics. Story is unremarkable.,Nice to watch but no true educational value. Skimmed the surface if this subject. Have seen many other documentaries that were of greater substance.
1,consistent technical glitches rendered it unviewable,This looked like an absolutely fascinating program and I ordered it for my son's ninth birthday present--but to my (and his) dismay when we started to watch it the DVD froze and jumped to the point that the program was unwatchable. I returned it for a replacement from Amazon--and had the same problem with the replacement. We watched another video immediately afterwards so I'm sure the problem was not with my DVD player. Too bad...it looks fascinating but they need to check their quality control.
5,INFLUENCE OF WOMEN IN THE SEQUENCES OF HISTORY,"THIS SHOW ILLUSTRATES THE OBSCURE INFLUENCE OF WOMEN IN THE EVENTS OF HISTORY.The teen-agedaughter of caesar dies in childbith giving pompey his child. Pompey rejects anotherwife candidate from the same family (of caesar) Caesar returns from the field and hasto ignore his long-term mistress for political reasons . the mistresssets up a sequence of events that result in caesar's murder by the politicians, anda subsequent war. Ultimately, Pompey and his family die as the result of his failure tore-marry into the family of Caesar.IT GOES ON AND ON, THE WOMEN CONTROLLING THE MEN. This is HISTORY REVEALED.I recently watched a HISTORY CHANNEL movie on this part of history and severalof the professors of history at universities don't know what they're teaching.HBO did a super job on this too-short series. The casting was excellent.C"
1,Don't buy from this seller,Had caught some episodes of Rome on HBO and wanted to save a few bucks on getting the complete first and second season. Seller stated he had new original box set which I purchased. Some of the discs cut short or skip sections. Defeated the reason I purchased the complete set.
1,Disappointment with packaging!!,"I am an Archaeologists/Historian and was so looking forward to watching this series since I did not have HBO when they aired the series. So for Christmas I received this box set and was thrilled, loved the first few discs until I got to what I thought was the 4th Disc, instead the package included two, yes TWO bonus features discs. The confusion, I believe rests in the incompetence of whomever packaged it and inserted two VI discs and not one disc IV and one disc VI, Roman numerals are easy to confuse but still care should have been taken to ensure that every package contained the right disc not the right number of discs. Very disappointed!!! Love the episodes I was able to watch, but I did not get to see two episodes, very disappointed!!!!!!"
1,more men in tights,"Men in tights, you can see some chicks bods though. But the same old bunch of guys with swords talking about who rules with Renaissance festival accents. reminds me of the movie ""role models"" and how ridiculous that medevil park was but it was funny.Bought this, the tudors and felt betreyed. Wont do a series like this ever again!"
1,"Porn, period.","Porn, just porn. I will have to wait until it is substantially cleaned up for USA or TNT."
4,Rome,"I enjoyed watching this series, it was very entertaining. The packaging needs some work. The sleeves are too tight for the discs."
5,Rome,"I have been very pleased with the quality of the mini-series Rome. Although, I am sure some license of liberty has been exercised, I am very much pleased with the what appears to be the attention to detail. The clothing, the buildings,the busy streets, the contrast between the rich and poor, the social structures (slaves, patricians) and how each one fits or behaves or dresses, the food and the lack of food, and the types (mice, eels) of food which were commonat that time (I also understand that hummingbird tongues were a delicacy), the water and sewage systems, public toilets, open nudity and dress, the town crier who was vocally and physically expressive. All of these and more left mevery much impressed with the all the behind the scenes work to bring this ""epic"" to Blu-Ray. My hats off to the casting director who seems to have done a splendid job in choosing the right actors/actresses to portray their respectivecharacters."
1,An even better idea for those 8% morons,"Since 8% are willing to throw away $80 by buying both seasons together, I think Amazon is missing out on those 5% who also buy ""300"" for $23.99. They need to give them a ""Package Deal"" for a mere $243.88. Apparently P.T Barnum was right after all - ""There is a sucker born every minute."""
1,Discs Missing,I love the Rome Series and was watching the DVD's and came to discover that I have 2 Season II Disc III's and No Season II Disc II
1,Could have been an enjoyable movie,"This could have been an enjoyable movie but...it's like a cheaper rated porn film most of the way through and the language doesn't even fit the time! Don't buy it unless you like nudity, foul language and orgies!"
5,Mesmerizing!,"Rome is very detailed in everyway. This series has captured what we know in history and filled in the blanks. Very interesting! Although definitely not for the kids! Its very graphic! The sex can be more then I signed up for sometimes. It also has very graphic violence which I expected. The story line is wonderful, which is what has me coming back all the time."
3,Rome,"To me this movie was to pornish, like any good story line and some of the scene's were quiet nasty. No family honor at all and their was way to much blood......"
5,Good Set with Good Price,"'Rome: The Complete Series' is one set that I wanted for so long. The price of this set is ridiculously expansive in Canada, $135. I was waiting the price drop, but it never happened. I am happy to get it with such good price."
5,Buy this.,"I became friends with every major character, despite their tragic flaws. The acting is superb. The locations and set are stunning. This is not a movie for your kid's Social Studies class. There is full frontal nudity, rough sex, and strong language. It's very HBO. I'll do my best to wait until next summer to watch it again. I'll rewatch Deadwood this winter."
4,Great series,Rome is great. It's hard to go to bed and stop watching. it.Scenarios are really cool - real great production.
5,Rome DVD series,Great series! I would highly recommend this DVD...the acting is amazing. I have watched it several times and saw something new each time.
3,"Great as a gift, but some glitches","I bought this set as a gift for someone, and was informed sometime later by them that Season 1 Disc 3 crashes their computer. It runs fine on my computer, it runs fine in a DVD player, but it crashes some computers. This is a known issue by HBO, and they refuse to do anything about it. I've downloaded and burned episodes 6-8 (which were on disc 3), but it's still dissapointing."
3,Soap opera with a historical setting,"I purchased this series expecting it to be good historical drama, but found it to be a soap opera on a lavish stage. Granted the storyline follows true historical events, but the immoral behaviors displayed by the characters in the subplots overpower it. When I read the description of this series, I don't recall reading about how sexually explicit and violent some of the scenes are, but parents know that this is NOT a series for your children!"
3,Not that great,"The series was okay, certainly not as good as most Amazon reviewers would have you believe. But really, how many times does this particular tract of Roman history have to be gone over? We've all seen this Ceasar/Antony/Cleopatra/Octavian-Augustus story a million times. I'd like to see someone do a movie or mini-series on some other piece of Roman history. How about a series about the life and times of Emperor Justinian, set in Constantinople? It could be based upon Procopius' ""Secret History"" (or even upon Graves' ""Count Belisarius"") and have all the sex and violence HBO needs."
5,Illinois Resident,This series is an excellent production done by HBO. The binder that the CD's came in is great. You have a book mark to place which CD you are on and each CD gives a little narrative. Highly recommended.
5,Exceptional Movie,This is an excellent film. Couldn't wait to get home from work to watch it. Hope there is a Season 3.
4,"Once you get started, you're hooked!","This is one of the most engrossing and entertaining series we've ever seen! It truly makes Roman history come alive--with all of its splendor--but also its seamier side-- and the political intrigues of the main characters are fascinating. The story is told from the standpoint of two Roman Centurion friends--who are caught up in the shifting currents of Roman politics, sometimes benefiting and sometimes victimized by these changes. As their stories play out, you witness the Roman transition from Republic to Dictatorship--and all the tumult that ensues. The acting, staging and story-lines are first class! WARNING - There is graphic sex and violence--probably not suitable for children under 17/18."
4,Excellent Series,I bought this as a Christmas gift and have heard it's much enjoyed. I may get a set for myself!
5,Great series!!!!,"Rome is a fantastic series. Great story, great characters, beautiful women. My only gripe... I wanted more!!!The Blu-ray looks fantastic and is full of decent extras. If there's only one gripe I have, is that the english subtitles are full of grammatical errors. It's sad that I noticed that when english isn't even my main language. But it's not a detractor!!!"
4,Rome,"I love these types of movies, and this is no exception. It's done very well. I just wish they would have continued..."
2,"Good start, died early.","The first 2 disks (not seasons) were interesting, but the characters blend into eachother...and even knowing quite a bit more about Roman history than the average joe...the mistakes were just awful. Modern habits, slang, and even 'too-perfect' costumes made me cringe at every scene.All this aside, the storyline was VERY hard to follow. One episode isnt much different than the rest. One big drama episode with zero continuity. I had mistakenly watched all the episodes on disk 1, then started disk 3. I didnt really miss much when I went back for all of disk 2!I was really looking forward to this series, but I just can't get into it any more. Its as inaccurate as the ""1980's Cafe"" in Back to the Future."
5,Looking forward to this in blu ray,Best thing HBO made in a long time next. LIke Deadwood. But only two seasons? Time for a movie !
1,Order received incompete,"Missing the last 5 discs of the 'complete series'. Also packaged with insufficient packing - package broken. In spite of this the contents appeared to be complete due to internal original packaging. However, inspection upon receipt found five missing discs."
1,8%,"I was amazed to see that8% of the people who viewed this page actually bought this item. when people ask why do overpriced marketing stunts work, you need to talk to those 8%. Buy them individually."
4,entertaining series,"The first season was riveting, second season not quite as intense but still great. The acting was terrific, and the characters were colorful. I wish HBO would make a third season."
3,Packaging,"Product was in an acceptable condition..It was not as new as described, however I believe poor package resulted the minor damages to the book cover.. Packaging should have been better as obviously it was torn while being handled.But other than that, no other comments"
1,the famed beat poet fails to deliver,THE Beat Poet fails to deliver once again. i seriously don't know where this man's fame comes from. it isn't his poetry (with the exception of Howl and a few other poems). there really isn't much to say about ginsberg's work other than it is bad. maybe if he had spent a little time in revision he could have done better. you're best off with his selected or collected poems.
3,Not very tasty,I can only drink this if I actually blend it with pineapple. The other flavors have been tasy but this one is not.
5,Faburous Collection on Country Yodel,"it's very good Selection of country yodel by historical yodel stars. especially incrude big present is nashvill's bright and famous yodel queen,rosalie allen's yodel boogie.recording on SP days, but peak of country yodel now.too patsy montana's i want to be a cowboy's sweetheart. et.marverous country yodel festivals."
4,For advanced only!,"This book is especially good to advanced users with some basic pharmacologic background. It contains clinically useful drugs and their effects, abandoning those which you will never meet in hospital. I recommand it to senior medi students for their clinical rotation."
4,Decent Greatest Hits,"But not as good as first album. If you want his best album, pick up Return to the 36 Chambers. Classic. His other album, Nigga Please, is also rock solid. So if you have both of them, there is no need to get this cd, because its pretty much just a mix of the two. Nevertheless, his greatest hits is very good, but some of the songs shouldnt be on here. My favorite songs here are the classics Shimmy Shimmy Ya and Got Your Money, Brooklyn Zoo, and Cold Blooded. If you want ODB at his best, pick up Return of the 36 Chambers. If you want more ODB after listening to that, pick up Nigga Please. This should be the last ODB cd you pick up.R.I.P. ODB --- 1969 - 11/13/2004"
4,Dont listen to most these reviews...,"they must not be fans of odb at all. the only real flaw is that sussudio and some other good songs werent put on, but overall it gives you a pretty good idea of ol dirty. if you just heard ""baby i got your money"" and liked it, maybe you should try listening to his more rza-ish tracks from the early days like brooklyn zoo and stuff, before you get this to see if your into his more common slurred funny yelling style."
4,r.i.p big baby jesus,"2 albums wasnt enough to have a greatest hits out, buy return to the 36 chambers its much better ,this shouldve been put out after more albums which wont hapen now, rip ol dirty"
2,"he old, he dirty, and his cd ...","ok this cd is not only missing a good rapper but also some beats. The tracks that RZA produced all sound the same, but the one's produced by the Neptunes are not good but listenable. The joint wit Chris Rock is the only reason i give it 2 stars, that joint is pimped out. It also only has 11 songs so it aint really worth spending money on it, just listen to Recognize"
3,so-so,there are only two tracks on this album which are worth listening too: 'shimmy shimmy ya' and ' got your money'. these are great tracks and would be worthy on any other greatest hits album. With the exception of track 2 the rest is pure garbage. all the tracks sound the same and his voice just gets boring.buy the singles for tracks 1 and 3 and give this one a miss
1,chivalry glassware 1,Received my purchase (glassware) broken - extremely damaged box.had carrier return to sender - never heard anything until i received a notice that my account was credited - would have like for the another case to be shipped to replace - i guess i will need to re-order
1,Does not work!,I have had success with nasal pumps including Vick's Sinex and Afrin No-Drip Severe Congestion. One might assume that approximately the same product by the same brand would be equally effective. This product does not live up to the claim that it keeps nasal passages clear for 12 hours because that would imply that it is effective at all.
1,Worst nasal spray of all,"I do not use any type of medicines, but I do need nasal sprays and have been using them for a long time. I have used several different brands and I can say, without a doubt, Afrin is the worst of all. It makes my nose feel like it is on fire. On top of that, it is not true that it lasts 12 hours and it is the most expensive and overpriced of all."
1,Very deceptive,"This DVD tries to come off as Christian. However, several statements throughout the film prove that it is not. The narrator and experts continually call Jesus a ""traveling preacher."" At one point they refer to Jesus as John the Baptist's deputy. In other places they quote a shop owner who does not believe Jesus changed water into wine, only gave water an alcohol taste. They proclaim Jesus' message was about how the poor deserve Heaven, rather than no one deserves salvation but it is a gift of God as Scripture says. In the finally, when describing Jesus just before He was crucified, the narrator states Jesus had a crisis of faith and that He was ""not sure God can or would wish to help Him."" I have seen more balanced and truer portrayals of Jesus Christ on the History channel."
4,Dirty South Thesis,"The production of this album could have been better, but for that time, it was enough for the club scene. The content, however, would only prove to be trend-setting and ahead of its time. The lyrical style was old school-basic, but lyrics were favored by rappers like Master P, Lil' Jon, and the Ying Yang Twinz (just to name a few). I actually bought this album on cassette twice and once on CD, either of which I still have, and miss dearly. I'm struggling with parting from $40 for this damn CD, but for $30, I'll do it in a heartbeat. For the memories, this CD gets 4.5 stars."
3,So so,"This cd has 4 good tracks. If you remember this stuff when it came out in the early 90's then maybe you'll still love em. If however you've never heard this stuff before you'll probably just think of this as ok but nothing special.Musicwise these are slow bass beats with simple, catchy, vulgar chants. Several tracks use the 808 break from 1985's 'Drag Rap'. DJ Jimi's voice is gravelly and it's why these simple chants are effective."
1,Poor Vendor Service,"I ordered this item from this vendor. When the order indicated shipping was still pending 2 days after the last expected shipping date I contacted the vendor who simply stated ""unfortunately, this order has been cancelled"" with no further explanation. I replied to inquire as to who cancelled my order and was then informed that the vendor is out of stock. In my opinion, having not informed me that the vendor was out of stock asap after receiving my order is poor business practice and bad customer service."
3,Nesco Fruit roll up trays,"These did not fit my dehydrator which is from harbor Freight, but I was able to easily cut them down with scissors to fit perfectly."
2,Unable to tell the size from the description,The description on these were misleading and they don't fit my dehydrator. It would have cost as much as I paid for them inorder to return them. I just hope I can find someone that could use them.Make sure you can find a size prior to purchasing these.
2,Wrong size,These trays are too large for the Nesco (FD 35) American Harvest Snackmaker. It needs Model LSS-2
4,Yum,"Since we got our fruit dryer just as the fall fruit season drew to a close, we haven't gotten as much use out of this and related products as we would have liked (I will potentially update this if my opinion of the product changes). We were, however, able to make a few batches of fruit roll ups before running out of cheap, fresh fruit.A word of warning to anyone purchasing, with theNesco/American Harvest FD-80 Square-Shaped Dehydrator, the time it took to dry fruit rolls was significantly longer than what was mentioned in their booklet, almost 1.5 times as long. So if you are planning on taking them out just before bed, make sure you start earlier than suggested and then watch the progress.Beyond that, they produced delicious fruit roll ups, and worked perfectly with the dryer linked above. Cleaning was super easy, and the fruit peeled right off without much of a fight."
1,Not helpful and overpriced,"I don't usually review books, but I was compelled to write about this one and my disappointment. A staff member purchased this book for my use. The authors in the intro make it sound like librarians are being dragged kicking and screaming into the information age and that this book will make it less painful. The book is intended to provide help in updating your web site - not creating one. Title is misleading in my opinion. The content is disjointed, there are no examples of how your code will look, there are even some tags that I have never seen used on any web page. Plus, I have already found one typo. The price is outrageous even with the CD (which is not very useful). Don't buy this book if you need to learn how to create or update web sites!"
3,Bobby's Ballads,"You'll find all of Bobby Goldsboro's hits in this collection. The songs are sentimental, 'Honey' is a true weepie, so ladies may want a few tissues to hand."
2,Nice and rare soul oldies. Terrible-sounding CD.,"The major problem with this CD (this holds true for all of the other ""Lost Soul Oldies"" volumes) is that while most of these songs are very nice and are good examples of 1960s and early-'70s soul balladry at its best the sound quality is awful. Buy only if you are a die-hard fan of rare oldies."
3,David Alexander's Mr. Hard,"I found Mr Big and Mr Long at TLA Video purchase both of them from TLA Video and found the Men and Boys in those books where done better than what I found in Mr Hard. Even thou it is a three book series I liked the other two books better than this one. In this book there are pictures of Items that are for ordering some of the pictures back when. I would have preferred more pictures and of younger guys not all made up in cowboy hats, macrame shirts and pants, Etc."
1,Dehydrator,"During the holiday, Grandma has a special recipe for beef jerky, my original dehydrator was dropped, and was broken, so I had to get another, so Grandma could make her special beef jerky, and I search the internet, and found that amazon.com had the best price for what I was looking for, and it was delivered on time. Thank You for making my holiday a special one."
4,Leaving you high and dry,"I had purchased this dehydrator at a retail store for more than it is offered here, but it is worth it. I sit in an office chair all day and tend to get a case of the ""munchies"" during the day. I used to buy candy bar after candy bar, which in turn put a few pounds on me as well. With the dehydrator I can make healthy foods to snack on that are good tasting and economical. I would suggest to anyone looking to save a few dollars and a few inches on the waistline to invest in one. You won't regret it"
5,Great little machine!,"Forget the more expensive models. This is all you need. From dried fruit to beef jerky to garden vegetables and beyond, this great little cooker does it all! The only bad thing is the pounds you'll gain from inhaling the luscious aroma of what you're drying....Great for crafting with the kids, too. Also recommend Deanna Delong's ""How to Dry Foods"" as a companion to your dehydrator, especially if you want to move beyond banana chips and beef jerky."
3,One of the two screens arrived torn.,"One of the two in this set of dehydrator screens arrived torn/cut. This is fairly thick material, so it must have been cut or damaged before it was packaged and sent out. I guess it's probably useable as it is, but it's disappointing to order something new and have it arrive in a damaged condition."
5,Perfect!!,I love these tray inlays!! They make drying fruit so much easier!! I would fight to get my fruit off my trays before i had these. i always use them when i dry fruit or anything small. also it has a nice lip which makes it easy to pick up.
5,A dehydrator must-have...,"...if you like to dehydrate small or sticky/sugary foods. Perfect for berries or small chunks of fruits/vegetables; came in handy with drying herbs as well. They keep the small stuff from falling through to the bottom or lower trays, and it makes clean up of the sticky stuff a cinch."
2,Warped,I got two screens with my dehydrator and I ordered two more pairs for a total of SIX screens.I have used them maybe 6 times and ALL of the screens have warped and will not lay flat on the trays.I thought they were over priced for pieces of plastic but I assumed that they could at least withstand the heat of the dehydrator they were designed for!I have replacements coming so I hope they don't warp again.
3,It's ok,"This was an ok item to get. I really dont see a point to it now. My friend told me I NEEDED these. That clean up was easier, that it would make dehydrating so much easier. I really don't think so. If you are considering buying these...You really don't need them. They don't make a difference."
5,Very useful,"What aa great idea, these make cleanup so easy. I would recommend these for anyone that is purchasing a dehydroator or needs extra screen for theirs."
1,Items received were not model LM-2-6; had to return them,"The item description says ""Nesco LM-2-6 Clean-A-Screen Tray for ... FD-37"". I have a Nesco FD-37 Food Dehydrator, so that model of Clean-A-Screen is the correct one to order. Unfortunately, I had to return the items because they sent model MS-2, which is the wrong size -- too big, so I could not use them.The good part is that Amazon allowed free return, so it didn't cost me anything. I didn't have to wait too long for the refund, either.I ended up going to the manufacturer's (Nesco) web site and ordering there, to make sure I got the right product. It was more expensive than Amazon, especially since I ordered 7 of them."
4,Nesco American Harvest Clean-A-Screen Tray,Nesco American Harvest Clean-A-Screen Tray & Fruit Roll Sheets for FD-27 & FD-50 dehydrator does everything we wanted it to do. Great for keeping the trays clean to shorten clean up time.
3,A little disapointed,"The trays arrived a little warped, they dont want to sit in the trays flat. I have them under some books hoping that they will flaten out."
5,I Love Them!!,"I have already ordered 4 more! Since receiving this past week I have dehydrated cooked rice, about 30 lbs of diced peaches, 10 lbs of diced potatoes, 2 bunches of green onions, one bunch of celery diced, 4lbs of carrots diced and 3 big bunches of parsley. These inserts work so much better than the DIY craft mesh inserts or the parchment paper. The difference is like night and day. I highly recommend them. I will be ordering more as I order my extra trays. I've got 6 trays with clean a screens right now and have 6 more to go."
1,Dark and bland as the cover.,This CD is an unpleasant chore. The music does not engage and takes you nowhere. Save your money.
5,Just what I ordered,"My daughter chose this Bolo pattern for her flatware in her wedding registry. Amazon has great prices compared to the major dept stores. This will be great for entertaining for appetizers or just every day use! Yes, they are small but this is the purpose of these buffet spreaders."
2,These don't solve the problem at all,"I installed the product well knowing that the holes in the power outlets and the switches would let the air still leak.Please don't buy this, instead use foam sealant or caulking (research it first) and it will stop air from leaking in the box when applied in the wire holes and around the box.I gave it 2 stars because they might help a ""bit"" and I doubt any good energy auditor would recommend this. They should help with the ""outside"" the box leak, not from the inside the box leak."
4,Your Own Personal Rave,"I first heard this in a store, but they were all out of it. I even went over to Tower, but they didn't have it in stock or even in their computer. I could always count on Amazon, of course they had it! Waiting for it to arrive was unbearable. However, it was well worth the wait. It's a non-stop mix, so the songs flow beautifully into each other. Unlike some mixes, you can actually tell when the songs begin and end. I really like the first 5 songs, but my favorite is #5, ""Look at the Stars."" Just pop in the CD, close your eyes and let yourself get into that trance. You're well on your way to your own personal Rave!"
3,Not too bad,"Well, it's not too bad. Myself being on a mighty spru-can, can say it's made me look at things a little differently."
5,"Great Book, gives lots of ideas!!!","I love this book! It gives lots of ideas on many different ways to create you own masterpieces, such as techniques on using inks, watercolors, acrylics, oil, pastels along with other materials and mediums to achieve hundreds of different effects. It should be used to create your own pieces of art and is not a copy this and you will get that, kind of book. It is a how to achieve this type of look in you art book."
5,The Best of the Special Effects,In my opinion this is the best of the painting speciasl effects books I have read. The fact that it covers all mediums makes the reader want to try each one. I recommend this book highly.
1,for the craft lover,not really meant for the true artist. More for those seeking a craft. Pretty pictures included without alot of substince.
5,"Wonderful for paper artits, very creative, inspirational","As a rubber stamper & paper arts lover I found this book very useful. It is packed with tons of ideas and numerous color photos inspired me. I would recommend this book to anyone who ever runs out of creative ideas or needs some inspiration.Included in this book are many techniques for creating stunning & unique backgrounds in almost every media type. Ideas include texturing with sand, freezing or microwaving ink, and using a non-stick spray as a resist.However, this book is not just for backgrounds. Painting techniques for many mediums are also included. There are original and helpful ideas for using pastels, acrylics, oils, inks, gouache and watercolor.Finally, to my surprise and delight, it also covered encaustic painting, carving on hardboard & then painting it, impasto effects and many original ideas for batik type work. Get this book and use it!"
3,took long to get the point.,"This book was a good read because of the message it represented in trusting God. However, it could have been 200 pages shorter. I felt like it was puzzle than took more one day to put together. I just wanted find out the big secret that Cassidy was keeping from Trevor; unfortunately, I had to read about 400 pages to find out."
3,"Entertaining, but not felt contrived","I thought that this book was entertaining...it was a fun way to pass time during my morning bus ride. However, it felt very preachy and contrived. I thought that the characters were not really developed...Trevor seemed just as like a proto-type for a Godly man, but he didn't seem like a real person.The author used a literary device I had never seen before. In between each chapter and sometimes even within the chapter she jumped to a completely new scene without any transition or logical continuity.I wish Christian fiction was more a reflection of the grey areas of life instead of the black and white resoluteness of what we ""should"" be doing."
4,Forgiving is not forgetting,I enjoyed the book it is an easy read with some great words of wisdom. It arrived in good condition.
3,"Good book, decent cases","My biggest complaint is the writing is dry as toast. I much prefered the book Case in Point. The cases were just as good, the author has a sense of humor and the ""Ivy Case Method"" kept me away from a cookie-cutter approach."
4,lives up to name,"Living up to the Wharton name, this guide is a good step by step walk through several case examples. Also recommended: The Vault Guide to the Case Interview and the Vault Guide to the Top 50 Consulting Firms."
1,Not what I expected,"I thought that the book would be a book and not a workbook style book. Please note that the MSRP is $3.99 for the book so if you are being asked to pay more, they are ripping you off. I am very dissatisfied as it will be $3.99 to send the book back for a refund, so it will be a wash."
5,"Natural product, works better than any other!","Have used this product for many years, we love the eucalyptus w/saline. In recent years, only available online....and now ""out of stock"" :-( Very sad..."
5,Pretty and seem to hold liquids well,"I made my own Febreze/ sheet spray for my kids. I figured that making smaller amounts might keep the essential oils from fading. They don't seem to leak and (now for my girly comment) are a pretty blue.They seem to be very dark which would predictably protect the contents from light and fading.Good price, good product...what else do you need to know?"
4,only problem: too short!,"this is one of the most exciting new artists i've heard all year. picture dizzee rascal had he been born a sri lankan girl, mix in some raga influences and you're getting close. if you're a fan of hip-hop that's looking towards the future or even if you're just a fan of rock and roll's underbelly, you must lend this girl your ear. the only problem: two tracks is a tease! i can't wait for more."
2,Indicator light for alarm on doesn't work.,"Bought the cambridge soundworks radio through amazon.com who get's it's through J&R Music World. After getting the radio, two days later the indicator light that tells you if the alarm is on stops working. Can't tell if the alarm is on by looking at the radio. This sucks. After paying 213.78 what do i do ? Send it back? Who knows, wait for 2 months to get it back. All for one tiny little light. I,ve decided to live with it . Sounds good, but don't know if the alarm is on by looking at the radio. I am not going through the trouble to send this back. I rate this radio a 2 star."
4,I am very happy,"This is a very good radio. I didn't have the opportunity to carefully compare to other offerings of Bose, Boston Acoustics, Tivoli, etc. because I received this as a birthday gift from my wife. The sound is not as pristine as the Bose Wave radio which I have heard at the mall, but it is quite good. The bass boost subwoofer works great, reception is great, the aux input on the front connects to my iPod. I couldn't be happier. It gets an A for ease of use and the credit card sized remote is appreciated."
1,Terrible Quality,"Pro: good soundCons: one of the alarm indicator lights not working, remote only works within a range of about 2-3 feet directly in front of the unit, alarm presets don't work...the alarm turns on to the last station listened to at the last volume listened to, AM reception is horrible.I'm sure they're not all this bad but others have had similar problems and it shows they have a long way to go to improve quality."
3,Good sound poor tuner,"Sound quality very good. I own other high end radios such as the Boston Acoustics Recepter and the Tivoli Model One. The cambridge sounds as good as the others with the added benefit of tone controls and a remote. It falls way short though with its tuner. I have a lot of difficulty pulling in anything but the strongest stations, even after adding a large aftermarket antenna. The tuner is so poor I rarely use this radio. If you want to pull in weak stations go with the Tivoli."
3,Cambridge SoundWorks 730,"Very good sound and nice esthetics, but as a clock radio it is awkward. It is impossible to adjust the alarm without using a handheld remote and the settings are not easy to use."
1,Item Returned,"Guess I was shipped a defective unit.Have arranged a return/swap with retailer J&R; music.Hopefully, the swapped unit will work better."
5,Charming sounds,"The music from Charlie and Lola's favourite and Best music record is just like the tv show: it's like a collage of sounds (creatively put together) that instantly reminds you of the animated series.Many of the tracks include dialogues between Charlie and Lola in such a way that they tell you a little story, and the companion music does a perfect job illustrating those stories with sounds: is really nice to hear and at times, fun.The case contains art like that of Lauren Child's books, and the video included (The Bestest in the Barn) is very pretty and fun to watch.If you're looking for cheerful, nice, alternative and creative music (suitable for children and even adults) this CD will do the job."
3,AAAaarrrggg,This is one of the many editions of Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy Battle. It features color art and photographs. All the rules you need to play are included in a single book.
2,What a disappointment,"This game COULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME. This game is really fun to play, it has good graphics, nice sound, and easy controls. BUT, I cannot get over the lag times. This game even lags during the opening! How any company could release this game is beyond me. I have gone through 12 or 15 holes, even with all the lag, only to have the game freeze on me. But, I still play it. BUYER BEWARE! Do not buy this game unless you have a LOT of patience."
1,Swing Away Golf,"I am sorry but, I thought this title was terrible! It did not take long to adjust to the fact that you have to hit an extra half of club for the distance given. The putting was way to easy. If it was a straight putt and you never flunked second grade math you are going to make every putt. The putts that had any break you could take out with aiming a tad outside the cup and give the putt a little more juice. I scored 68 and 59 in my first two rounds. The major problem with this title is that you have to play with a computer player during tournament play. There might be a way to turn that option off, but I never found it. It took almost an hour and twenty minutes to play a round of golf. Normally a person can wip around the course in thirty minutes. I wanted to give this title a chance, but I could not invest all the time it would take to take a player to the championship."
5,Thanks,"Product was as described. I have yet to use it yet as it has been raining but when it's dried enough, I plan on the repair. If it's not enough I will be placing an order for another."
1,excessive shrinkage,"This pad fit before it was washed, but shrunk at least 3-4 inches in length after first washing (we washed according to instructions.) Tried to stretch it to fit anyway, play yard mattress curled up and didn't even lay flat. After reading reviews of this company's similar crib mattress pad, this seems to be a recurring problem. Not to mention: it isn't 100% cotton (the stretchy sides are synthetic) which means it's not 100% organic as advertised. A total flop."
2,Does shrink badly,Looks and feels like a very nice product. Washed & dried on delicate cold cycles in very gentle front loading machine but still shrunk too much to fit Graco Pack N Play. You can push mattress pad down and force it to stretch but the mattress buckles and doesnt seem safe.
4,Works great,"We needed a waterproof layer for our kid's pack and play at Daycare. This is thin enough that we can use any cheap sheets, but still does the job."
1,shrunk,The pad shrunk and I have never had a chance to use it. It looks like it would have been great if it fit. It's nice and thick. It's unfortunate that it does not work now.
4,Good play yard mattress pad,I got this to cover my mamaDoo mattress topper which we use for our Graco play yard. It's a snug fit but it does the trick. I like that it's organic cotton.
2,Not much of a pad,"The PlayYard Pad is more of a PlayYard cover. Fits a Chicco PlayYard pretty well. It goes on like a fitted sheet and provides the tiniest bit of cushion above the hard Chicco PlayYard pad. I was expecting a thick (at least 1"") pad that slipped over the PlayYard pad and would actually provide some padding, but not this product.I would not buy this again. Look elsewhere for a soft pad to put in your PlayYard."
5,"A rich, well-written survey of the signs and planets","I started studying astrology 2 years ago and I have read a bunch of reputable astrology books that talk about the sun signs and the planets, but they did not leave me with a very clear understanding of the function of the planets. Soffer draws from a rich wellspring of knowledge -from Chinese philosophy to Jung, to both the Greek AND Roman mythologies (most books only explain the signs' connection to Greek mythology) to weave together a coherent explanation of the signs and the planets. I also like that she seems spiritually advanced: ""The chart we are born with is unfinished, as we are. It is our task...to fulfill it. Not to perfect it, because it is already perfect, but to complete it."" A fascinating piece of work, I recommend it to beginning and intermediate students of astrology."
5,Great Season Just Because of Episode 109,"Season five is decent for various reasons but I would highly recommend it for no other reason than episode 109 titled ""It's No Place Like Home for the Holidays"". During the episode the Connors find themselves scattered throughout Lanford on Christmas Eve due to a massive snow storm. Dan, and DJ are left to cook Christmas dinner at home with Nancy and Marla (constantly under the mistletoe) and at David's house, Darlene gets a better look at his abusive home life. I'd say the real magic of the episode is at the Lunchbox, where Roseanne, Jackie, and Bev ponder the meaning of life and how to decorate Nana Mary. This is a great Christmas themed sitcom episode!"
2,"Love the show, but product inferior","I love this show and would highly recommend getting it, but unfortunatley I had to return it twice. The disc kept skipping and freezing. The price was great, but I hope they improve the product because I would love to have this season."
4,"Great show, great season","""Roseanne"", a fantastic nineties sitcom revolving around the boisterous real-life comedienne Roseanne Barr, and her fictitious working-class family (the Connors) in suburban Illinois, reaches its zenith in its fifth season. Everyone seems to be stuck at a game-changing crossroads: eldest daughter Becky's relationship with Mark asserts its importance, while sister Jackie deals with her own bad romance; middle child Darlene decides to get an alternative education, while her boyfriend David moves into a new home. The cherry on top? While the Connor family automotive shop is going under and Roseanne and Dan pray they'll make ends meet, a sudden and unexpected death in the family stops Roseanne in her tracks. With every episode propelling the story forward, this iconic season was the one to break new ground and touch on those ever-so-taboo topics in a way that viewers and critics alike admired."
1,Please lower the prices,what the heck? How come you can get season 1 through 4 at a decent price but the others are way too expensive. Come on I'm not paying for that price
1,Missing Farley,"I don't know why in a DVD set that edits out his performance, does this product description list Chris Farley as a guest star. You never really know what you're getting with edited/cut/mangled DVDs of classic TV shows like this... You can be sure it isn't what you remember from TV broadcasts or old VHS tapes. It's shameful to let buyers believe these are uncut and unedited DVDs. They aren't and if that's what you're looking for (like I was), better keep on looking."
1,too pricey,Most of the other seasons are around $15 so why is this one almost 70? Too expensive even for a new dvd. in Stores you can find this season brand new for 34 bucks! I refuse to pay this.
1,Dissappointed!,"I gave this cd away after just one day. It is not worth the money! Maybe if you got the entire version of the song, otherwise don't waste your time or money."
2,Not good quality,The service was great. But the actual product was very cheaply made and didn't fit very well together. The trays wouldn't stay together and I found myself always worried about if they were going to fall. The actual nesco dehydrator is just made out of [low-cost] plastic.
3,Second times the Charm,"I actually got this dehydrator a few years ago as a Christmas present. The first time I tried to use it was a bust. But, lately I've been trying to save some money and figured making my own jerky was a good alternative. My first attempt was pretty successful.I was worried that it wouldn't get to the right temperature to do the job. 24 hours after I started it up I was surprised to see that all the meat strips I had put in it had turned into jerky.Great way to start making your own jerky and dehydrated camping, hiking, foods."
1,Software and Firmware,"This camera comes with good hardware, it is a rebrand of icamview iCV-22.The firmware uses UDP, not my favorite choice, it will not allow you to use any software other than the one that came with it.To make things much worse, the software that came with it gives me very little features, and i find it inconvenient .All in all, i would advise you to stay away from them, i have had good results with trendnet (works for many months and not a reset needed yet), D-LINK and AXIS, they are good, if this thing was hackable (will not happen, little ram) this thing can become anything from a print server (With a USB printer) to a nice IP CAM... But until that day, stay away from this one."
1,Waste of Money,"I just tried out my NEW Jerky Kit... What a DISAPPOINTMENT... The ""tool"" was very small & could only handle about 1/3 pound of meat. I had to re-fill it several times for 1 pound of hamburger. When the meat comes out of the Jerky Maker, it continually ""spits"" & ""drips""... WHAT A BIG MESS!!!You'd be much better off saving your money & using a rolling pin to make your jerky..."
1,Substandard,The gun is very cheaply made. Whenever I tried to use mine with regular ground beef the end of the handle always popped off. It can't handle the small amount of pressure needed to push the meat through the exit port without the handle snapping off. I don't understand all the good reviews. A complete waste of money. Mine is in the trash bin waiting for the garbage man to pick it up.
3,Works good but doesn't last,"The product certainly does do it's job and makes formed jerky and beef sticks, but being that it is of cheap construction (like everything else it seems) doesn't last all that long. As another reviewer posted, once it starts making popping noises, you're on borrowed time as the internal spring piece (what you push down to pull the barrel back) will strip out and become chewed up, especially if you're using harder cuts of meat (or meat with more fat/water as it gives more resistance). I would've preferred if they had used better parts, but obviously it would cost more, and you wouldn't have to keep paying money and buy new ones!"
4,Does a good job and is easy to clean,"I was a little skeptical about trying to squirt chopped meat through a chalk gun but this device works exactly as advertised. I was also worried about cleaning it but that turns out to be very easy. You can easily get your fingers into the tube to wash it. My only minor complaint is that it requires reloading twice to process a pound of meat and that's really not a big deal. They now make one that will hold a full pound. I don't see myself ""upgrading"" anytime soon as this works just fine."
5,Beef Jerkey Lover!!,"I used to spend hours cutting beef and then more time mixing marinade. After the jerky was done, lots of cleanup from drips on trays. With this machine, I can prepare 2 lbs of Jerky in about 10 min, then dehydrate until done. Cleanup is also very easy with a little soap and water. The spices taste great! My friends cant believe it's ground beef. I have been making jerky for about 10 years and have used this product for about 5. I have not gone back to the old way of making the jerky. This is easy, simple, clean and fast!!!!"
2,Barely gets by,"After borrowing my brothers, I decided to buy my own jerky gun. I bought the exact model he had but my first one would not advance the meat. Amazon replaced it with another one that still did not work, the cap kept popping off when I pressed meat into the tube. I returned that one too and gave up after that. If you can afford to pay $40, then go get yourself a real jerky gun.Pros: Cheap, cleans easily. Comes with a variety of spice packets in the box.Cons: Cheap, flaky mechanism, capacity is only 1/2 pound, must refill often (two fills per dehydrator tray)Advise, if you use the cure that comes in the package, use only 3/4 of the quantity, the prepackaged amounts tend to make the meat too salty"
4,Excellent first CD from a German young band.,"Not every song on this CD is a winner, but the first half at least are very catchy. Pop-rock mix with some great heavy rifts. Well worth a listen."
5,I heard these guys in concert,"When I went to the Creed/Sevendust show in Greensboro, I found out that the Guano Apes were going to be the opening act.Let me just say, I was converted into a fan by seeing them in concert and bought the cd immediately after. They played ""Open your eyes"",""Lords of the boards"",""Wash it Down"" and a few others. I was just amazed by the way the singer blended her voice so well with the music and that is saying alot cause I dont really like female singers.I would definately recommend this cd to everyone."
4,Aggression wrapped in electric velvet,"I bought this CD the day it was unleashed in the Netherlands ans it totally blew me away. Sandra Nasic sings excellent, on moment it sounds like she's whispering softly into your ears, only to scream your head in the next few seconds. There's a lot of riffs and sounds that you don't notice the first time 'round but they're present and add to the overall feel of the album. I loved it. Buy it and you'll know what I mean."
5,Open your wallet's and buy it!,"I heard ""Open Your Eyes"" and knew I had to hear more from this group.After listening to the samples I am definitely buying this cd.There is a mixture of songs thet keep you rockin. Nothing boring on this cd."
2,"catchy, true... But nothing more","There is one awesome song on the CD, Open your Eyes; one of the best rock songs I heared all year. I bought the CD based on that, unfortunately - with the exception of Lord Of The Boards - the rest comes short. Some songs grow on you, but the melodies are too much ""gimmick"" like, making some songs a bit ""over-acheived"" on being catchy. Sandra - the singer - has an amazing energy and a voice to match it, this makes up for a lot. But I'm afraid this is to be a one-CD band... I hope I'm wrong, cause with a song like Open Your Eyes, you do hope for more. This CD however doesn't offer it..."
3,"Doesn't live up to the promise of ""Open Your Eyes""","The whole reason I bought this CD was for the song ""Open Your Eyes""-I was BLOWN-WAY by that song when I first heard it.The song is awesome in every way,especially the singer's voice.Except for P.J. Harvey,I'd NEVER heard a female rock singer with a voice of SUCH skill,strength,power,ferocity,and rage.Her voice is an unearthly ROAR,it's MAGNIFICENT.I figured she could sing ""Yes,we have no bananas"",and I'd enjoy listening to it:o).Sadly,the rest of the album doesn't live up to the promise of ""Open Your Eyes"".They're not BAD songs,but they don't rock nearly as hard,and the lyrics aren't deep at all.Still,that VOICE is interesting to listen to even if the songs aren't great.I'll buy their next album."
5,Do ALL the Apes have intellect? YES!,"I have nine Guano Apes CD's. However, the Planet Of The Apes has the cream of the crop, which is where I would point ANY first time buyer of the apes. If you already know & like the apes, You already have a working knowledge of their offerings, great!. I have an unusually wide spectrum of musical interest. I LOVE ""Quality"" wherever it may be found. My collection also includes, Tapping The Vein, Die Happy & Lacuna Coil. I even like The Lords Of Acid once in awhile. But as of late, Whenever I feel the need for un-leashed raw female power & expression, I reach for ""Planet Of The Apes"", it Frosts My Cake. Expand to other Guano Apes CDs, like ""Proud Like A God"" AFTER you've experienced Planet... Breathe in the aroma, kick the turds around awhile, get to know Planet Of The Apes, first. There ARE great tunes to be found here."
5,AWSOME,"When I first heard Guano Apes it was while watching some guy go down a snowy mountaine on a pair of skis on ""Warren Miller Fifty."" The song ""Open Your Mind"" cought my eye and I checked out the band. These people have got a good message and (even more important) good music. They kick up a really good song and I would recomend buying this CD."
2,Better options abound,"This game is ok if your looking for a shooter on the cube, but there were much better later Recon games and other shooters that came out later. Get metal gear for the cube instead. You get a much better game that is also collectible."
5,Ghost Recon,The game is packed with the action that the gamers in my house crave. Ordering was easy and fast. Everything is always delivered in good condition and on time.
5,Tom Clancy Has Done It Again,"Before I begin, let me tell you, this game is not for any undetermined fighters. True, it is not as good as the XBOX or PS2 versions, but it sure as hell beats the heck out of most fighter games. Ignore the weopons, they stink, but you can beat most shooting games with only a pistol. What I'm saying is: If you don't know how to plan, you'll screw up pretty badly. One more plus, it's perfectly fine for teens (not people younger than that).The squad you lead is a double or nothing squad. One man down and you feel that you have failed the mission. The excitement and realism is amazing. But remember, if you don't care, you don't win."
1,Ghost Glitch,"Needless to say I won’t ever purchase another Clancy or Uni Soft game. I found the movements in Ghost Recon to be slow and clumsy and about every fourth play the game will freeze up entirely. The “combat” is unrealistic and the weapon systems wholly inaccurate. Very disappointing, but we live and learn. Peace."
4,WOW!!!!!!!!,Oh my god this game is so good. If you don't like this game you should be shot. it is also a great starter game. So if you don't enjoy this game BURN IN HELL
5,MUST BUY!!! Muy Bueno Disco!!!,"This Cd is very good, very catchy, songs have meaning. Vocals are amazing. This band played at a local show and they are so freakin' talented it amazing. Buy it!!"
5,Canon SD 40 Case,"This case fits the Canon SD40 camera snugly (there's no room for anything else), but is perfect for protecting the camera in a handbag, pocket, etc. The pink does not match the pink camera though -- best to go with a black case. The leather is a bit stiff."
3,My memory drew it better,Childhood memories of this airing on HBO sure have it drawn much darker and like an anime rather than a cartoon. Too bad that it ended so abruptly (unfinished first season).
4,Not Widescreen,Love this series-the graphic animation is incredible. Unfortunately the the details on this Amazon post are wrong. It's not widescreen but standard aspect ratio. I watched for 10 minutes on wide till I figured it out...oh well...still a great watch.
5,Wish there was more....,This was a great animated series and it was a nice addition to my movie collection. The steelcase it comes in is pretty neat though it has the disk holders that make getting the DVD out an immense pain in the behind. All in all if you like adult cartoons and or Spawn you will be satisfied with this purchase especially for the price (I paid $5.99). My only complaint other then the annoying disc holders? I wish there were more seasons of it.
5,Great deal! Its a must-have.,I love this collection. It is one of the best adult animated series out that and for the price its a steal. The only thing is that someone uploaded a picture with a Spawn comic book to this item so just be aware that it doesn't come with an issue of spawn. At least mine didn't in which case I should be angry haha
4,Kick ... cd,"The June spirit rocked. Great songs with great messages. ""Can we lip sync to this one"" has, quite possiblly the best, and most touching lyrics i have ever heard. Do yourself the favor and buy this cd today. The Junespirit should have never broken up."
5,"Favorite CD, band and so forth...","My favorite song on here is number 3. I love the guitar sound at the end and pretty much every thing else about it. I have downloaded other songs from this band online and I thought they were great. If you're looking for a band that'll be big one day and you want to know them before they are, check them out. I talk to the bassist, Dave, and he's ""real"". He's a really nice guy and I hope I see them in concert soon. Can't wait for Testing Superstition to come out."
2,Way to get all of your friends to review your album.....,"Fact is, if you knew anything about this type of music, you'd know it's barely even listenable. And notice all of their reviews all say barely anything about the music and everyone's from the same area in NJ? It's a shame but the June Spirit just aren't good, and it's quite generic. Everybody who says that the June Spirit are the best emo band obviously haven't heard too many bands, because there's nothing special about this at all, other than the atrocious lyrics and the generic instrumentation. It's not even that I think that they're much worse than most other bands, it's just that it seems like the majority of people who like this drivel aren't particulary intelligent."
1,Bleccchhhh,"Come on people, this is awful. The lyrics are so inane that i know I must have wrote them when I was 11. The music is standard NFG-meets-Further Seems Forever. Nothing special here. I'll even go out on a limb and say that these guys are worse than the Starting Line. Yeah, they're that bad. I'm sure they're nice enough guys and I hope that their next release is better, for their own sake."
2,Give Me Something Else,"Though The June Spirit's 'Treat Me Like Someone Else' is an EP, it still is one of the worst EP's I've ever heard. The music on all of the tracks runs into one another, and at times is very repetitive. The lyrics, are nothing to be proud of either. On the second track, ""Subject To Change,"" this song was definitely changed. The re-arangement of the song should not have happened. The June Spirit should have left the original version of the song the way it was, instead of changing this great song. This EP is nothing like their first, 'You Want It, You Got It!' If you want to hear a good band, don't listen to The June Spirit, save yourself. Download at MP3.com The Early November's songs, you won't regret it."
3,Gets a silver,"3 1/2Neill mastered the art of drive-at-night electronica by way of his unique horned-centric programming, though often fell pray to the pratfalls of generic drum-n-bass and house techno when not painting inspiring passages."
3,ILLBIENT,"THis CD has some real nice Illbient textures, but the beats just aren't as funky as one would hope for. I would suggest recloose ""this is the dining room"", or WE ""AS IS"" for both atmospheres and the funky beats."
3,"Same Old Drums and Bass sound, it lacks staying power.","I first popped the CD in hoping for something unusual, what I found sounded very mature. The album is tight, I just like my music a bit more unstructured. Dark Gift is a great song along with track 10. Maybe it will grow on me, but the first impression was not good."
3,The Breathe Right strips are excellent for those ...,"The Breathe Right strips are excellent for those who have trouble breathing due to a cold, allergies, or even when exercising. The adhesive on the strips is strong enough to adhere without feeling that your skin is being stretched. The only problem I had with the nasal strips was that they were too big for my nose, so the effects were not as great. I would recommend this item, though, as an alternative to medication."
1,Product does nothing...,".. for sinus congestion. The whole point to this DRUG-FREE* product is to physically force your nose wider so that your nasal passage is opened a little more. That's it. Even if you removes the strip the way they reccommend it pretty much destroys the skin underneath.*look above the product name on the box. Isn't that coy of them, to bury that detail so inconspicuously?"
1,These Breathe Right nasal strips are a waste! ...,"These Breathe Right nasal strips are a waste! They don't do a thing! I still woke up with my nose just as stuffy as when I went to bed! You're better off buying stickers from a toy store. They're cheaper, they feel and look equally weird on your nose, and they will do nothing (just like this product!)."
3,SKS Fire Sight,"Sight does make front sight post much more visable, but the new sight post will not tighten up all the way, it moves slightly from side to side... Williams needs to fix this problem.."
1,ALL CENSORED,Personally I like the original uncensored version. I'm really starting to think that America sux when it comes to censorship. I would love to know where to get the original. If any one knows who reads this please e-mail me. noah@innernet.net $$$
5,A great guide for starting your college years,"I was looking for a book for my nephew to use when he went away to college. This book caught my eye because it had all of the useful topics I could think of in the index. Then I saw on the front cover that the New York Times had called the book ""Outstanding."" That caught my eye. I looked at the other books on the same topic and chose this one for its usefulness and penetrating analyses of any possible problems a college student could have from personal safety to surviving his classes. I think this book is a great find, especially for college freshmen. My nephew says he has gotten lots of good advice from the book."
5,Learning the easy way!,"Who gets excited about a book for graduation? I did! This book has all kinds of tips--from roomates, fighting the freshman ""10"", to the $5 date. I love the stories in the margins. I think I know some of those people. Thanks to this book, I will Survive!"
5,Awesome!,"I had wanted After Effects for years, but when I found I was eligible for the upgrade path because I owned Photoshop I got the Production Premium suite. For me it was like getting eight programs for free. And these are awesome. I am an amateur animator so this is this most versatile package for animating as a one-person studio. I combine it with Toon Boom Studio to achieve much better results than I could previously achieve."
2,"Great songs, terrible quality of CD","The liner notes of this CD state that it was mastered in 1999, so there really is no excuse for it sounding as bad as it does; in fact the LP I have containing some of these songs sounds much better, and it is over 20 years old. Unfortunately, this is the only thorough compilation of Davis' tunes. It would be hard to believe that original master tapes were used as the source for this project. It sounds as though they taped the songs off the radio back in the 80's, and then used a 20-year-old-cassette as the source. It's sonically muted and in some cases there seems to be a subtle oscillating of the pitch of certain tracks. Perhaps the engineers really wanted to get an authentic""warm"" 70's/80's sound, but it just doesn't do his voice or songs any justice."
4,Paul Davis ~ Sweet Life - His Greatest Hit Singles,"Sweet Life, '65 Love Affair were simply outstanding songs, I give them 5+ stars. This man definitely had talent and put out some good music in the 80's. Overall, four stars for this collection!"
4,good collection,"i really dug Paul Davis back in the 80's.songs like '65 love affair,cool night,I go crazy really make this disc good.i was glad to get this."
2,"Great Compilation, Wretched Sound Quality!","This c.d. is a wonderful compilation of Paul Davis's work and includes an insert that contains interesting synopsis of each song. However, the sound quality of this c.d. is atrocious! It's hard to believe that the company let something as bad as this be sold on their label."
4,Slow and steady wins the race,I have been exercising like a lunatic and barely saw any results. A woman at my health club said to try this weight loss system she found on Amazon so I decided to give it a try.I really don't like to write reviews about stuff because I feel everyone has thier own opinion and should be kept to themselves to share only with who they care to. But when I tried these products WOW I had to tell the world...I'm now the incredible shrinking woman. My body is getting back to the weight I was at before having my son. I really hope this review helps anyone out there that needs that little extra something to help them achieve thier weight loss goals.
3,Insane results in my first week...,"I am just about ready for summer weather. Yes, I'm ""one of those"" who's yearly New Year's Eve resolution is to get in great shape then doesn't go to the gym till April. Thank goodness for supplements. This weight loss combo exceeded my expectations. Not only am I ready for summer, I'm ready to compete for Miss Hawaiian Tropic 2006!"
4,Excellent weight loss results for me,"I was a bit skeptical since I don't like to take weight loss supplements of any kind. I tried these products so I can lose weight in time for my daughter's wedding. I tried losing weight without taking supplements and I had a terribly hard time achieving results. These really work, I saw immediate results."
4,Very happy with products,"I was desperately trying to lose the last of my baby weight before summer. This combination of weight loss products helped me achieve my weight loss goal without any freaky side effects like having jittery feelings, or faint/dizzy spells. I will continue to use and refer these products."
4,best weight loss aids I have found on the market,Very VERY satisfied with these products. Absolutely recommend them to others.
1,Detailed Observer!,"I haven't personally taken this product myself but planned on it. I noticed as I was looking through the reviews that all of the good high rating reviews were published at around the same time. To me, this kind of looks like someone from the supplement company is trying to promote this product by writing bogus reviews under different names or aliases. I've now decided to not buy this product. Personally, my inner belief is telling me that all diet pills are BS. In my case, I'm hypothyroidic and so I'll let the endocrinologists prescribe me real medication. Be aware when looking for diet pills!"
1,DONT FALL FOR IT...its a waste of $$$,I would give it ZERO stars if i could. I cant believe i fell for the super duper reviews! They must be fake. I bought this and regret it. I stayed on it for a month and there are SO many pills! I lost 3 pounds. that cant be from the pills. i was exercising and eating well...thats what it is at the usual rate of about a pound a week. waste of $$$. dont do it. I am actually doing the lipotropic shots and bontril...that really helps your diet. I have lost about 6 lbs in 2.5 weeks.
5,I dropped weight effectively with these products,"I am thrilled beyond belief with these products. What a clever combination for a fast and easy weight loss experience.My weight loss goal was 17 lbs, I was hoping to lose it by mid spring. I don't usually take anything but realizing that being in my early 30's I should probably look for something to give me the little extra help. I am so happy I went with these products on Amazon."
3,Great Combo for weight loss,My best friend had absolutely obviously immediate results. I just had to try this for myself and I can honestly say that I saw a difference in my body right away. Probably due to the diuretic (Aquadrene) so it was probably water weight but who cares..I look slimmer already!
3,works great,I just ordered my first combo package of these weight loss products. My best friend lost over 40 lbs taking these. I just had a baby 4 months ago and I still look pregnant! According to the time it took my best friend to lose the weight hopefully I will lose my baby weight and be in decent shape by mid summer.
1,save your money !!!!!!,"This stuff is pure (we hope it's pure something...) hype !!! Use your brain and do not fall for the fast sell...... it does absolutely nothing.....save your money and put in in savings or a gym membership !!!! You will see a far better return !!! This is pure bunk. Do not be deceived by pretty advertising. So maybe it works if you are 19 and have the metabolism of a humming bird..... otherwise, forget about it !!!"
3,Just placed my 1st order,I can't give these products a high rating just yet however my best friend has had tremenous success taking these and I'm sure I will too.
2,8 days and no results,I've been using the product now for 8 days and the only positive thing i can say about it is that i has slightly reduced my appetite. Im using it and continuing my regular workout routine but they results haven't changed.
1,3 pill weight loss system,Too many pills with zero results. I have nothing positive to say about this product. The price is outrageously high for a dud. There are much better and more economical products to be found in vitamin shops/nutrition stores.
4,Tomb Raider,Tomb Raider:The Prophecy is a must buy for any Tomb Raider fan. My only complaint about this game is that to continue once Lara dies you have to use passwords and when you use the passwords to continue you lose any items you got before you had to continue. Otherwise this is an excellent game.
3,Ugly graphics,"Ok, it's fun, it's collectible, it's Lara Croft (sort of), but... the little figure of Lara is ugly, badly drawn, godawful. It SUX! Lara climbing up a ladder has splayed legs and looks like a broken swastika. This ""Lara"" does not remotely resemble the clever and evocative animations in the older Game Boy Color versions (Nightmare Stone, Curse of the Sword). This game is dumbed down, easy to walk through without too much thought and maybe even just a tad bit boring. The GBC games are 4 stars, easily, maybe even 5 in places, but this one seldom gets beyond 3. For all that, it's a must have collectible, and a joy to have in its own small way."
3,Fun game,"The graphics are good, The sound is good. The boring part is that you have to type in passwords. If you always liked Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and you tought that the game was like the movie, it isn't anything like the movie. I would recommend it if you have patience."
5,bj on the Prophecy,"It's awesome. Awesome graphics, quick gameplay, and realistic battle sequences. It's a must have."
2,Opinionated yawnfest,"I'm a huge Tom Waits fan. Like, for seriously, of the ""own it all"" variety. There are some songs I don't like, but he is my ""only music stranded on an island"" artist. So, I bought this thinking if nothing else it'd at least have a bunch of interesting facts and music videos. Instead, there are 3 or 4 people narrating with their boring little opinions that focus on their own interpretations or personal likes/dislikes of Tom. They have these wooden personalities that are dull, dull, dull. I honestly can't think of a single redeeming feature to this ""documentary"". The few music videos they played are on youtube. There was one bit about the movies he was in I enjoyed, but I could have found most of that info just as easily on imdb.Do yourself a favor; rent this. Or better yet, just listen to Tom's music, watch his movies and music videos. Unless you want to be bored to tears by curmudgeonly ego maniacs."
2,Save Your Money!,"If you need a documentary of pseudo-intellectuals warbling on about the man, then buy this extraordinarily boring DVD. If not, put your hard earned dollars towards buying Saint Tom's entire album catalogue and liberate your mind. (Post Script: The critics on this turkey are almost as bad as those you see on Chinese Central Television, and that says it all.)"
1,waste of time and money!,"Anyone who would purchase this item is surely a fan, and will be disappointed in the content of this dvd. I can understand why this is film is unauthorized by Tom. It is a completely uninteresting and sometimes negative outline of a fantastic body of work, discussed by people who seem to have little or no credibility. For example, you have a person criticizing an album (Alice) who confesses he hadn't really listened to it. Are you kidding me? The few clip highlights, mostly pulled from Big Time, are not enough to save this ""film."" Tom Waits songs played over old film footage is also used frequently as filler, which seems like a freshman film student stunt. These are just a few of the non-highlights of this dvd. I know we are all dying for some great footage of Tom, but you're not going to get it here."
5,WHAT'S HERE IS CHOICE,"The songs on this CD are all memorable, done in Brook Benton's own style. You will not be disappointed. After several years of being off the charts, he recorded ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" written by Tony Joe White (""Poke Salad Annie"") and reminded us all that he still had the talent. There are some tunes missing here that would have enhanced this CD but perhaps they were recorded for another record company. There has to be a reason ""Revenge"" and ""Walk on the Wild Side"" are not included as the latter was used in a movie by the same name. Anyway,as stated, you will not be disappointed by the songs that made the cut."
5,The Best of Brook Benton-20th Century Masters-Millennium Collection,"Beautiful music by a wonderful talent. Put on this CD and sit back to relax and dream. Great buy. BHamilton, below Savannah Ga."
4,A Must Have!,"I bought the CD for ""Baby, You've Got What It Takes"" to use at our wedding reception for the wedding party introductions. I heard the song as an opening to the Sandra Bullock / Hugh Grant movie ""Two Weeks Notice"" and absolutely loved it. The CD is great and no one will regret owning this one!"
4,never knew,"never knew who sang Rainy Nights in Georgia. But I was looking for the song playing in the ""Talbots"" commercial - ""Baby, you've got what it takes"" - and came upon this CD. Sounds like it will be a good one."
3,bjsbeats,"Brooke Benton has several Best/Greatest collections, this is by far the best. All the songs are known. I am a collector of the 50's and 60's era music and this is one of my favorite collections."
2,Don't bother.,"This snippet of a story is too generalized and short to be worth watching. Plus, customers should be quite clear that they are paying for less than 15 minutes of video."
1,Never Received it,"Never received the item. It is going on 30 days now, but this should of been delivered 18 days ago."
3,Moen 87570,"A nice looking, well-designed faucet for the first five years. Eventually began to bind up and sound gritty as the faucet turned left or right. Disassembled and found a lot of rust and broken pieces. Called Moen and they offered to send a brand new faucet at no cost -- no questions asked. Paid $15 for quicker delivery via FedEx. Installation very simple -- newer model has more robust mounting parts but came with the wrong pull out nozzle. The old one worked fine and looked/felt better so used that one instead."
3,Motorku Nomor 1,"I have a CB100's and I need more information about it. I think that I use this facility I can find something. My CB100 have a problem in its engine. The OHC (OHC chain) can't work well. That chain frict pistone block and make a hole on it. I try to fix it, but its useless. That chain still frict the block. What can I do?And about the brake. My motorcycle front brake is not originaly CB100 have. My friend said that its Yamaha's have. But he didn't know what type is it. Its look like old type brake. Its use a cable not a hydrolic which using fluid on it.So if you have any information or opinion please send to me. Thanks for your attention."
5,This a lot of fun. Great album!!!,"I would highly suggest this for anyone who likes punk rock, blues, or old school ska."
4,Classy Sitcom,"Despite the obvious limitations of any early '50s sitcom - i.e. stilted performances, subordinate roles for women, etc. - this show was more than progressive for the time. ""Margie"" was actually a highly intelligent, independent character, who accomplished her goals without the abusive lecturing you find in today's comedy shows - if the show were made today, she would spend half the show shouting at ""Vern"". The show was very well written and directed, using physical humour when needed. In that area, Charles Farrell is surely one of the most under-appreciated actors. He was taking pratfalls in a three piece suit years before Steve Martin!Perhaps one of the reasons that the comedy was so well-balanced was that it was produced by Hal Roach, Jr., the son of the great producer of Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase, and so many other classics. It definitely has the Roach touch."
3,Not enough Melodies,"Not enough patriotic beautiful melodies that I remember from the past...If you like lots of loud brass, then this CD is for you.."
5,milwaukee tape measure,it is a great tool to have me and my co-workers love them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"great music, DVD is PAL","DVD is PAL format, 85 minutes, according to site abstractlogix, which also has soundclips of first 5 songs."
5,Awesome - truely amazing!,"Paulinho Sabia really did a great job on demonstrating step-by-step instructions! A really inspirational dvd and complete with short clips of regional style rodas in Brasil. There is the option of having a voice-over lady translate the portugues into english, but i would recommend just learning basic portugues and you will understand what Mestre is trying to say!I love this dvd and give major props for it!"
3,Decent,"This is a good workout DVD, I was too unfit to do it at first. Now, years later I've gotten into shape via mini trampoline and stretching I will come back to this. It's good cardio and conditioning. Plus you get some self defense out of it too."
1,We have moved on,"I had hoped for one of those grammar wonk books so dear to the heart of English majors, and I suppose at one time this would have fit the bill but its anecdotes and examples are all badly dated. It feels as if it is based on arguments that we settled long ago. It is proof positive that not all language is timeless."
1,Ineffective product,"This product is ineffective period. I bet I had a better chance to get rid of the ick on my goldfishes with Tums Ultra or maybe 4 tablets of Tylenol. I then bought Quick Clear and that got rid of ick instantly. I recommend you change 30%-40% of water after the rid is gone and if you have goldfishes, be sure to keep water at around 60 degree temperature."
3,Information missleading,"I purchased The Complete Atlas Wiring Book because the description mentioned this guide is good for any Atlas layout, and since I run Atlas three rail track, I thought this would a helpful addition. However, the guide itself specifically says it's emphasis is two rail track; which doesn't do me a lot of good. So, if you are using two rail Atlas track (or any other brand of two rail track), this guide is for you. Three rail? Look else where."
1,Atrocious mastering/recording quality on this set; bleak and dull,"I am the first one to ignore the less-than-perfect mastering or recording when the beautiful music calls for it; this set, however, is an entirely opposite case when even the gorgeous performances simply can't outcry the butchery brought onto them in the production process. Buy some other three titles from Galliano for the same money and skip this particular set!!!"
3,A Soviet Film,"This soviet film suffers from erratic quality color photography and filming and a sound quality that is often of a 1940's Western Electric style. The orchestra is extremely sloppy and the music is not very well played. Fortunately, the poor sound quality masks some of the worst orchestra moments. That is the bad news. The good news is that the scenery is appropriate to 12th century Rus and the steppes. The log structures and the plains scenery fits the story. Much of the costuming and action is very exciting and makes it clear why Borodin's music has been used to add atmosphere to US Westerns. With the exception of the Khan's daughter, all the singing seems really excellent within the limitations of the sound track. Poor quality dubbing is also a problem. Still, I can recommend this just because it is the only version of Prince Igor available on film. It has enough strong points to make it worth buying."
2,Step back from Conquerors --- 2 1/2 Stars,"High expectations usually deliver disapointing results. After Conquorers of Armageddon, I was excited to see what Krisiun would do next. Ageless Venemous starts off with Perpetuation and after about 2 minutes it seems like a parody of what Krisiun sounds like. This is not because of the song itself, but because of the production on the album. The same Krisiun elements are there: super-fast drumming, fast guitars... fast everything, but I feel that this album is overproduced and the drum sound sucks.I've read an interview with Krisiun where they even admit that they tried to make the sound too ""clean"". Granted, there are some good songs (Sephuchral Oath is an amazing song) but the album does not live up to previous Krisiun albums. With that being said, I enjoy Krisiun, and if you have a chance to see them live, it is worth it."
3,clickety clack,"The reason why the drums sound so f'd-up is that they are triggered and mixed horribly. In an attempt to gain clarity on what is truly exceptional speed, they tried to avoid a muddy result (see Morbid Angel's ""Covenant"" album). Yet, I can't help but feel that this album is so overproduced that they have lost the intensity. ""Conquerers of Armageddon"" was equally as fast -- still triggered -- but not overdone; a far superior and more intense album. All in all, though, the songwriting has improved and many of the songs are simply mindcrushing. It's too bad that the great musicianship is ruined by the rat-a-tat-tat of the drums."
4,"Faster, Stronger, but better?","Ageless Venoms, Krisiuns post-Conquerors album. You see, Krisiun tried the classic Slayer tactic of trying to outdo themselves in every album. But does it work here? Not really. Sure, its faster then Conquerors was, it has more memorable songs then Conquerors had, but is it better? On some parts, yes. The Legion worship is still prevalent, and the blast beats and double bass are definately insane. Alex's vocals are alot more deadly and forceful, while Moyses's solos can cut flesh into ribbons. But still, its missing something Conquerors had; addictiveness. Sure, its good as a quick fill of death metal, but prolonged listens can get a tad predictable.But still, like it or hate it, Krisiun are atop of the current death metal herd, behind only the gods Immolation, Suffocation, and Dismember.4/5"
4,Hard to Rate,"I will first state that I love this series. However, as of today (6 May) it is unknown if there will even be a second season. If it is not renewed and story lines are left hanging, I definitely won't be getting the dvd's."
3,Review,This was an intense seasonal show. It was hard to turn it off because you wanted to see what happened next. I did not care for the ending.
2,missing,"I really liked ashley judd in the series but it quickly became way too predictable and formulaic. With the final episode the obvious set-up for season II, I think I'll skip it."
1,take care,this does not work in any of my 4 videosall that comes on is DOES NOT WORK IN THIS AREAthink it should not be sold in england if thats the case
3,Good not great.,"Grim Reaper are a really good 80's metal band, but not a great one. They have good songs but I really don't like Steve Grimmets voice. There are and were alot better singers out there and there still are. Hopefully they will release the never meterialized 4th studio album now that they have reunited."
4,Good pad for the price,"I got this on clearance at babies r us, and even though it is square it fits fine over the oval bassinet pad i own. I think that this is a good quality product I like the padding and love that the organic pad will be in closer contact with my baby and not the original vinyl pad, and I can't wait to try it out once my daughter arrives. A nice economical alternative to buying a whole new pad to use."
1,BEWARE: Not 100% cotton,It is cotton and plastic. Worse for your baby and the environment than non-organic cotton. The title is very misleading!
1,"beware, not an oval pad","i bought this pad for my uppa baby bassinet, but when i got it, it was square and too big. it says it's organic cotton which i always assoicated with being soft. but was kind of stiff because of the liner. i ended up returning it."
1,FALSELY REPRESENTED,I thought I was getting a crib mattress cover as the picture shows. However when it arrived it was a cover for a bassinette matress. I returned the item and had to pay $5 shipping.
2,Not Crib Sized!,"Never took this out of the package because it's basinette sized, but it's not worth the trouble to send it back either. When I went back on Amazon to find a crib-sized replacement, which I still need, I almost overlooked the tiny mention of ""basinette"" again. Get it right Amazon!"
4,Informative video,Very interesting video about the history of Sacco and Vanzetti and the corrupted justice system at those times. I actually expected a little more details. Overall a must see.
4,Nike Men's Big Al Watch,"This has been a good watch so far. I've owned it for about a month and have yet to get the band resized, but that's my fault. It's actually not too bad of a fit out of the box. I have owned the Freestyle Shark Mako for many years and this one is definitely more ""dressy"" and more simple in its features. The stopwatch function only gives time at the level of seconds and not tenths of a second, so if you're into needing that level of detail this will not be the watch for you. I have found so far that many of the features or my perceived need to see lots of information at once has not been missed. I would rather have the style that this watch provides and I am enjoying the simplicity."
3,Scared the he'll out of me,At age 10this movie scared the he'll out of me saw it in NYC at my local theather.went with my brother mom got us out of the house for 60cents.It was double feature forget second feature.to see this woman touch something an turn it into a blob like creature was amazing to me an scary.WHERE Is the DVD of this movie.
4,passing his first full length,"mike is a great guy, and this is great album. he touches topics that you don't hear much, and you should thank him for that. give it a listen, and don't forget to support asian man records"
5,Gardner Bender #7111 500pk Cable Tie Assorted,It is very convenient. Product is of good quality. I like the box too... Quick delivery and I will recommend this to my friends
5,Definitely worth reading.,"The UML books cover too many notation options. The individual authors -- Rumbaugh, Booch, Jacobson -- all have worthwhile contributions to OO, but the Fusion method takes the best parts of each and puts them together. One glaring shortcoming: some notation that the authors call the Life-Cycle Model. It's academic junk. No one uses it. This means that you don't want to follow their method blindly. (I didn't care much for their Visibility Graphs, p. 80, either.) One strength of the book is that they present a Fusion Process Summary in Appendix A that ties things together nicely, including a useful diagram of the entire method. Even if you use UML, you need to pick out what parts of UML you will use. I recommend using the Fusion method -- minus the Life-Cycle Model (p.31) -- and do it with the UML notation. The book, UML Distilled, gives a nice summary of UML notation and terms. The Fusion Method is excellant for object oriented design."
4,"Strong method, fair description","The OO method described is more complete than any I have used. It does have some weaknesses, namely in parallel (multi-threaded) development. But it is a complete method. It is not simply a notation without process, or process without notation.On the down side, the book is dense, contradicts itself (e.g., the notation described in the appendix isn't used in the main text), short on examples, and somewhat short on how to use parts of the method.But it's worth it simply for the method itself."
4,Moisturizes Well,The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was that the gel could be a little thicker.
5,Excellent Product,I am a disabled patient on 24/7 oxygen and use CPAP at night. Also on multiple medications. This leads to congestion and dry nasal/sinuspassages. Ayr helps relieve such issues. Recommend to anyone.
5,Fixed my dry sinuses quickly.,"Medical doctors warn Vaseline in your nose can cause pneumonia. Also NEVER put Vick's in your nose.Use a q tip and gently rub the Ayr's along the nasal passage...Especially where there is dried blood, crust.It did not burn but was cool and soothing. Better than having a humidifier.... I no longer dread winter.I bought 5 boxes and gave to family members. All agreed ... ""IT WORKS!"""
1,Has parabens in it! Would not recommend for anyone,"This product is recommended for babies and children, but it has parabens in it, which the EPA recognizes as being hormone disruptors. I would never use this myself, much less put it up any child's nose."
5,For poorly EB noses,This stuff is fantastic for my daughter's nose - Please market it in the UK!!! we have to go to some lengths to import it - but it's worth it
5,First thing that has worked for me,"During Utah's dry winters, I experience daily nose bleeds. I've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers. After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours, I researched other treatments. I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel. THIS STUFF WORKS! I haven't had nose bleeds since using the product. I wish I would have known about it years ago. But two instructions for best success:1. Put the get on the tip of the finger (not the bottom) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it. (make sure your fingernail is cut short).2. Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible. You want to make sure you don't gross people out.3. I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life; no more daily bleeds!"
5,Great product,Great product. My pharmacist recommended it and I am so pleased with it. I ordered 4 tubes of it and I know I will need it during the winter months.
5,Ayr,Ayr is the best medication and there.are no side effects! Have battled with dry nasal passage for years and nothing worked until I stumbled on this. Five stars for a product I will never be without!
5,Keeps me breathing in the winter...,"Once the heating system comes on, I have to use this. Past winters, I would suffer from dried out nasal passages followed by nose bleeds. This saves my nose."
4,works well,our son gets a lot of bloody nose's and this product works very well for him.i would recommend it.
2,Stings like a mother.,"If you have dry, cracked nasal passages this will sting like nobody's business.It's moisturizing effects only last for a few minutes and then you have to reapply."
3,My son sneezes a lot after using it,"My 8 year old son keeps complaining his dry noses and seems picking his noses a lot. After using a few different nose sprays, he didn't have any improvement. In one of the doctor's visit, the doctor recommended Ayr gel. So we give it a try. In the first week using this gel, my son seemed like it. Although I noticed that he still picked his noses. Now it's the second week, he sneezes a lot immediately after using it. Is it normal? Now he refuses to use it any more. Any suggestions?"
1,JUNK,"Bought this product at Walgreens because the inside of my nose has been itchy all day. This product says ""with Aloe Vera"". Total waste of nearly $10. This product hasn't soothed any itchyness nor does the aloe scent seem to last very long."
3,Works great but has cancer-causing ingredients,"I'm a CPAP user and this was recommended to me by the CPAP rep. Recently was diagnosed as gluten intolerant and was looking up the ingredients (box long gone, just have tube) and found is has two different parabens in it. Parabens are cancer causing and I avoid them. It's unfortunate that they are in the product because it works great to re-moisutrize my dried out nostrils. Perhaps Ayr will reformulate it but in the mean time I will be buying another brand.Did not sting me at all like some reviewers noted.It's still better than Vaseline as Vaseline is a petroleum product - yes, like the oil they put in your car."
1,Burns and stings like hell,"Don't put it in your nose if it's even slightly irritated or chaffed. Because you will cry for the next 10 minutes. It's essentially a 100% alcohol in a gel form. Correction, 100% alcohol, but with aloe (a nice touch isn't it?) Like a full dumpster, but with a flower on a lid."
1,Bad Idea,"First off , I could not register it in my name, per Dell, it is still registered under the business that leased it, I thought it was a new unit, it was used, in good condition but used, secondly, on doing some research on the Dell website, I found that the ac adapter was on recall, per Dell they do not manufacture these anymore, and thirdly, it did not come with a back up cd or any paper work, manual or information, I called the company who sold it to Amazon and they said they would send me an accessory kit, it was supposed to come with it, I was told by Dell that the unit is useless without it. I returned the unit to Amazon with no problem, they were great, but, let the buyer beware, your better off buying brand new then getting an outdated used model. There are plenty of great deals out there!"
3,No software included???,"The Dell Latitude C610 that I bought came in good shape, but no software installed, no recovery books, no manufacture's literature. These are items that usually come with any computer and are definitely necessary. I don't see why the Microsoft software was removed??? I had to format the whole computer again in order to install Microsoft. Next time I will be more careful and make more questions before buying."
5,Panama,"This finely crafted novel brings the reader an insider's view of the long and often disruptive pairings of Americans and Panamanians, who struggled to co-exist on the walls of an engineering phenomenon: the Panama Canal. Like his protagonist, Carlos Miller grew up in this bi-cultural milieu, giving him a finely tuned authenticity. The immediacy of his writing immerses the reader into a tumultuous insurrection against the infamous Manuel Noriega. PANAMA is a great read."
1,Don't defend this!,"Like other ""updated"" Defenders this is garbage. Anyone who played the Jaguar Defender knows what I'm talking about."
2,Game is not worth it,"I bought this game, looking for a space shooter type game (something similar to Gradius or Galaga) to play when I was travelling. Game was too hard (a puzzle game more than a shooter game), and not very fun. Hard to control. Unless you really love Defender, try a different game."
3,not so good toy,This Harry Potter games is very fast paced and that is the fun part!! But the snitch is hard to get in the air and it comes out on the Slytherin side so the slytheins have a total advantage then the other team. My friends come over and even if they don't like Harry Potter they still play it for the fast paced part of the game and trying to get the snitch. You will get bord after awhile of the game.
1,Poor quality for the money,"I was very disappointed in this product. It is made of very cheap plastic parts. I spent $60.00 on this for my son's birthday and he lost interest in it after about 10 minutes. Not to mention that he was afraid of breaking it because it is so cheaply made. There is also a battery opperated spokesperson who keeps track of the score. Sounded intriguing to a little boy, until he heard it. You can barely understand the muffled voice. Complete disappointment and would not recommend it to anyone who is possibly interested. I would possibly pay $12.00 for this sort of toy/game, NOT $60.00. I have since returned the toy and have requested a refund."
1,Riddled with errors,"This product's CD case has the previous season's titles listed instead of the titles of the episodes on the disk. As a result, I have not viewed the contents and have not gotten satisfaction from Amazon on a replacement. I believe that all of the CD covers are screwed up, so I would suggest that no one purchase this product until there is an announcement that this problem has been corrected. I am extremely disappointed since I pre-ordered this item and several months later I haven't been able to enjoy the contents.Very, very disappointed in the total lack of customer service on this item :("
1,No Rating.,Unfortunately I never received Silk Stalkings the fifth season because my mail was tampered with. May I suggest to ALL SELLERS that if you want to be in this business at least charge for the cost of safe and reliable posting/mailing. The price is reasonable but I would rather pay more for first class and priority shipping than to be billed and never receive my item third class or media rate. Amazon's price may be slightly higher but at least I receive my purchases.
4,Wrong sleeve cover,"The Silk Stalkings, Season V was in excellent condition but the information regarding the DVD was for Season IV. This made it very confusing and I had to guess what episodes were enclosed."
3,Just a Little Confused,"I love the show, I have for a long time. The DVD's on their own were perfect; no skipping or scratches or anything. The only problem I had, was that they came in the same boxes as Season 4. The discs were actually Season 5, but the boxes said otherwise. I enjoyed it though."
3,TIME OF THE FUTURE Mother Earth,This album has some interesting songs but to be honest not that good to get me overly excited in a big way.
2,Very disappointing,There is a lot of Todd rapping in here and the lyrics are neither compelling and they are not helped by an uneven blend of music. I love Todd but it is no wonder that these CDs are selling for pennies. Look elsewhere for excelent Todd. This CD is only for the Todd starved fanatic.
3,Toyah tries her hand at a 90's dance sounc,"Toyah Willcox is a woman of many guises, trying many different musical styles, visual styles, and media formats. Despite the 90's dance track background, this is still Toyah. Her hallmarks are all here: wide open and powerful vowel sounds, quirky vocals ranging from impish to operatic. What is missing is the poignancy and humour of her usual lyrics. I would recommend this CD to the completist or to one who enjoys that 90's Dance sound, but if you want to find the best of Toyah get Love is the Law, Ophelia's Shadow, Prostitute, or Velvet Lined Shell."
4,Great book. But could go deeper on combinations,"This book gave me the decks to destroyed all others decks I previously lost from. The only thing I missed in the beginning was some explanation of some combination of cards.Later when I was playing the game more and more I found some great combo's that where not explained in the book. Especially in the beginners decks I missed this. Although explaining all the possiblities upfront will take away a lot of fun, for a beginning player it would be more than nice to have.So if you just started playing the game wait a while with buying this book. If you have played the game more than once. Buy this book. Oh, by the way did I already mentioned to buy this book??"
2,"good book, bad time","This book was very good back when it was first published, unfortunately it only gave decklists and not advice on mana curve, the land:spell proportions, or things like that. So, as of 2004, it's not fit unless you're playing type 1, or extended."
3,Kind of cool,"It is a cool book , lots of different decks and types. Unfortunatly it has alot of errors (like a mono blue , marked as mono black) and the opinions of the author aren't that good. Loved the intro , with the enviroments and stuff. The book is cool ,but could be much better."
3,Open-ended and Useful!,"This collection of decklists is appropriate for an intermediate player who wants a springboard to better play. However, each deck can be greatly improved; core combos are excellent, but the support cards are not the best. A good reference of deck patterns and tournament types."
4,"It's a good book, but...","It's a good book, and has lots of preconstructed decks. It's too bad it doesn't have deckbuilding techniques."
1,DONT BUY,The book was written in 1997 and well its a total waste of money im sad to say. Its just out of date...it could maybe give someone some ideas of how to build a deck but again its old.
5,Full Scale Knowledge Management,"This is a premier book on knowledge management--a definite must read. Although it's a bit pricey and not in main stream distribution, please note that Tom Davenport is the co-editor. The book provides an inside perspective on how Siemens, a 400,000 person global company has scaled KM to be both part of their business practices and their business model. Since they operate in over 190 countries, it's easy to see why the communities of practice concept would be so appealing to them. Given the limited amount of available literature related to communities of practice, the how-to chapter about communities in this book makes it worth buying the book. As you read about the KM work at Siemens you can get a good sense of how KM will eventually reside permanently in the main stream of management practice. I have collected quite a bit of the KM literature and would place this in a top ten read list."
4,"Not cure-alls & you need to place them just right, but good","I recommend these little guys... but you need to place them just right (as the instructions say). I've gotten the best results when I place the middle part as high on my nose as I can, but still low enough that the left and right flaps can just cover the tops of the ""sides"" of my nose. To better illustrate: take a look at the ""right"" and ""wrong"" pictures in the instructions, and obey, but just keep the ""middle"" part as high as you can. Also, definitely make sure you wash your nose with soap & water and dry well before attaching; if they become loose they're useless.I don't use these for congestion, so I can't comment on that function.They're expensive, and they're not magical cure-alls, but they help me sleep a little better (and apparently reduce the volume of my snoring), so they're certainly worth a try."
4,Great info but full of typos,"Behind Closed Doors: Domestic Violence in India is an important contribution to those who wish to understand domestic violence and wife abuse in different cultures. The author provides the narratives of several different women, letting the reader compare the difference and similarities in abused women from different castes in India.The book needs to be updated for 2010... And please - - - Would some one please proof read for typos? This is not the first printing of the book and there is no reason for it to have so many mistakes in it. The mistakes take away from the professionalism of the author."
3,Way fun!,"I really didn't know anything about the Ferengi or their approach to life, but this made for a lively gift - everyone reading aloud some funny rules. Here are two: ""Never sleep with the boss's daughter."" and ""Always sleep with the boss."""
1,Not worth the money,"Poorly formatted with extremely large text. Nowhere near a complete list. But to be fair, there are only so many rules that are referred to in the series. Asking for a refund."
4,study the Ferengi secrets inthe Ferengi Book of Acquisition,This is the mythical tome from which Ferengi children learn the basics of acquiring massive treasures over a lifetime! Study it and become a wealthy miser.
3,An amusing little book for fans of Star Trek. Just laugh and enjoy.,"I have been a lifetime fan of Star Trek and I have enjoyed all their various different series, including Deep Space Nine. For those who do not know the Ferengi race in Star Trek, they are known to be ruthless in their business dealings. This little book, which only has about 70 rules, is an example of their philosophy when dealing with people in business situations. This is not meant to be taken seriously, unless you happen to be a Ferengi?In conclusion, yes, this little book is expensive for the amount of information it contains; however, a lot of these rule are humorous, some are interesting, and a few are actually helpful. Just laugh and enjoy this little book. It is, however, just a fair book little book for Star Trek fans.Rating: 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art Myths)"
5,love it,ok it says never sleep with the bosses sister but sleep with the boss lol are all of the bi lol
2,Skip this one.,"Six bucks for a tiny trade paperback with a small fraction of the Rules and black-and-white photographs from the show? Quark is laughing at you. Anyway, as we learned from a DS9 episode some time after this book was published, they're not really rules at all, they're just suggestions. All hail Grand Nagus Rom."
2,Missing several rules - including ones referenced in the series,"I thought that this book would include ALL the rules, if not at least those mentioned in the series. I was very disappointed that several rules were missing. Maybe I can understand those that weren't referenced in the series, but they didn't even include all of those!"
2,"The Rules, Nothing but the Rules","I was disappointed to see how small this book is -- physically and content-wise. It's a small paperback that lists the Rules of Acquisition (1 per page). No frills, no extras. I guess it would be a handy pocket-reference guide if someone needed a pocket reference to the Rules of Acquisition (maybe a young Ferengi studying for a test at school?).I would have like to see a little more (maybe a cross-reference to the Episode or Book where the Rule was 1st mentioned or an index or a little background on the Ferengi culture and the role of commerce, etc.)"
2,title should be changed to: 70 out of 285 rules,"The title implies that this is a book of ALL the rules of aquisition. Well they got me, I had not read the reviews. Your six slips of gold pressed latinum were just swindled from you, if you purchased this book as I did..... Two stars since it is pocket sized, and I kind of like that."
4,It's really good,"This is a really good writing book for people who like Korean. The only thing I wish it would have is a CD...only because I like to know how to say the words I am writing. Other than that, it's great."
4,Surprised,"I nearly bought this on the Tmobile site for $24.99. Even with postage and shipping, I saved a lot - and yes it works fine."
2,Hardcover does not guarantee quality,The translation is awkward and there are typos and misspellings as well as just plain wrong words on almost every other page. No one bothered to edit and proofread. Sophocles deserves better. Try another edition.
4,Fascinating,"I found the short articles in this collection to be quite fascinating. When I first saw the book, I really thought nothing of it, until I opened it up - I couldn't put it down. I was compelled to read every single article, advertisement, etc. It's a fun coffee table book that's quite a conversation piece. If I hadn't ventured to Stonington, ME, I would have never discovered this great find!!"
2,Motorhead Lite,Great selection of songs but too many sound like they have been remastered as though Motorhead was trying to get them played on a top 40 radio station. That's not Motorhead. Get a live CD such as No Sleep Till Hammersmith for a true Motorhead collection.
1,A VERY BAD COLLECTION OF SONGS,"Ok, to be fair, I'll start with the positives. Sure its a 2 disc collection, and it includes the usual suspects ""Ace Of Spades "" ""Bomber"" ""Overkill"" etc... BUT , ( now the negative part ) ALOT of Motorhead's Best songs are NOT included on this 2 disc set, songs like ""Angel City "" ""Born to Raise Hell """"No Voices in The Sky "" ""Hellraiser"" ""The Game"" ""Burner"" ""Im so bad baby I dont care"" etc.. Are NOT on here, and its a 2 disc set ? They had the room to include these songs plus other hits but they didnt, and yet to make mater worse , The song ""Bomber"" is included twice here, the second version being performed by another band, and also the songs ""Motorhead and ""Please dont touch "" are also included twice on here , again each performed by another band. Thats a waste of space on disc. So in conclusion, this is a TERRIBLE compilation cd. For a better ""Best Of "" collection I suggest buying the ""Everything Louder than Everyone Else "" LIVE Double cd instead."
2,"Great price, but you will pay later.","The opener worked flawlessly for about 1 year. After spending some time with tech support, which is very good but requires too many steps, determined the board was bad and covered by warranty. It was the original green board. Now the unit is no longer under warranty and the replacement board is bad, this time a relay seems to be the issue. Now I'm looking at a replacement board for over $200 with a 1 year warranty. I don't know if the blue board is any better, but I'm hesitant to try."
1,Not recommended,I bought a Mighty Mule FM502 about 4 years ago. For the past 3.5 years they worked fine. About 4 months ago I replaced the control board for about $200 as it quit. Recently the worm gear nut in one of the arms wore out. The threaded nut is made out of plastic/nylon and is not replaceable. The arms are considered disposable and expensive. A single arm costs approximately 50% the cost of a new unit. I am obviously unhappy that I didn't buy a more quality unit in the first place. I recommend the same to anybody buying a gate opener. Steer clear of anything with plastic parts and/or units you can't buy replacement internals for.
1,stay away,"I have two mighty mule 502 gate openers that I purchased 3 years ago & have had nothing but problems. I have had to replace the circuit boards 5 times, 2 control arms and spent enough money that I could have purchased 2 ""high-end"" openers. THESE THINGS ARE JUNK!"
5,Works great - now my neighbors have them!,"I installed one at our family beach home. The install was easy (although I had to spend a little time to improve my gate and post so it wouldn't drag.) Two and half years later and both my neighbors have gotten one - ideal location for solar.Make sure your gate opens smoothly without hitting the ground before installing or it will stall when it drags.I had to finally change the remote setting from factory because my neighbor's didn't and I open all three sets of gates when I use my remote.The intercom is nice to use when guests are visiting, when they call you from the road you can let them in. However, you can also deny entrance to your daughter's boyfriend!"
1,Simply does not work,"I bought the model 502 some 12 months ago. I never managed to make it work. It may work a day or two but then start the problems: the beeper does not stop to beep; at any time, day and night (the neighbors love it!); means: the device is out of control and will neither open nor close; just beep. The whole is a complete misconception; the electronic part is fully out of control and will constantly signal whatever problem and/or simply not work. Sure is: you will open your door manually 4 out of 5 days! The charger that comes delivered is actually a transformer without any function. I also bought the 5 W solar panel: forget about; it will charge the battery on an extremely sunny day up to one cycle; from then on, you open your gate by hand (I live near the equator) for the next 24 hours. If you like to sit in your car and to realize that you have to leave it in order to open your gate: Buy the FM502; it'll keep you fit!A complete waste of money and time for a perfect dissatisfyer."
4,VERY INTERESTING-NEEDS A LITTLE MORE CZECH PHRASING THO,I loved this book but it needs much more czech to english phrasing to help you get by while in Czech.
5,LOVE THE CALENDAR!,I was one of the first few to order the calendar when it was announced in the Spring. Love it! The pictures are awesome! :) I love that the eps (episode for non FarScape fans) the pic is from is listed as well as the actor's name. :) If you don't have this? What's the matter with you?! Get it! :)
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of June Carter Cash and, of course, Johnny Cash. I bought this CD specifically for Johnny's version of ""Grandfather's Clock."" However, I found most of Johnny's work on the CD to be very disappointing. June's work is better, but still not her best except for Appalachian Pride."
3,It's OK,"THis game is pretty good except for the fact that it is very hard and the gameplay is VERY disappointing. When i bought this game i thought it would be alot like the Tomb Riader games. It is.........except it is much more hard and borring. THe graphics are are great but once you get to the 2nd and 3rd missions, it gets really hard. If you ask me, RENT THIS ONE FIRST BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY!"
2,OK,"Its an ok game. Its only really good if u play it the first few times so u should rent it. Don't get this game if you have played many shooter games and r good at them. I recommend this game for People who have never played a shooter before. I rented the game and it is pretty good and I was so excited to get it then I rented Metal gear solid 2 and it just blew this game out of the water. I fI were u I would Just Get Metal Gear solid 2 or 007 Agent under Fire, They're more fun and have better graphics."
2,"This is a game you shoul RENT, not buy","This game is pretty good until you reach about the fifth level. Then, it just gets boring. You do the same thing over and over again. I think you shouldn't waste your money."
2,EA Production Staff should be ashamed!,"When purchasing the game i heard all the decent to horrible reviewes it received, but i still purchased it. Dont make the same mistake i did, X-Squad is a truly bad game which makes you second guess PS2's capabilities (at least it did for me!)"
2,Yawn.,"Another review to a average game. Well, i need to put my opinion to it. Pretty good for a early PS2 game, but then i didn't hear about PS2 until 2001, this game came out 2000. The charecters are godawful. They say affirimitive 4 times before doing something. The voice acting sounds like they are reading from cue cards. Syphon Filter 2 is a lot better than this game, and it's on PS1! EA could've done so much better. The A.I. is pathetic. Not much ""stealth"" ither. The graphics, gameplay, and choosing your weapons through points save this from a 1."
4,Pretty good.,"The graphics are good. The controls are tricky, but once you get used to them they work well. I played all the way through twice. I enjoyed it even more the second time. Your squad gets in your way and the get themselves killed a lot, but you get them back later. Most PS2 games have been a let down. This one was fun."
4,I liked this game.,"The kind of games that I like usually include a role-playing game, or sports games, or games with a goal to accomplish. This game had a few of those components that I like, it had a role-playing element as you play the head a 5-person team that is sent into different missions to accomplish certain tasks. This was a very cool, I rented this and may at some time in the near future purchase this game. This was a cool game if you like the rpg style or games with a mission or goal to accomplish, you might like this one. Check it out, rent it first, though."
5,Best PS2 Game Out So Far,Ive only played this game for about an hour total but i think it is one of the best games i have ever played in my life
4,Clear & concise,Clear and concise would be the way I describe this book. It helped me understand the Bible in a much fuller way.
3,Moderately Disappointed,"This won't be very long, since I am not overly concerned with being critical of this book. However, the five-star rating is somewhat misleading.Nelson's book is essentially a 323 page list of female nonverbal communication patterns and behaviours, contrasted with a list of male nonverbal communication patterns and behaviours. The first 100 or so pages provide a psychological analysis of the reasons for the communication patterns the author discusses. The extent to which the author ""moves beyond"" simply stating the differences between genders, is a ""Gender Rx"" at the end of every chapter, that basically tells women to use more ""male nonverbal behaviour"" and vice versa for males. Not an extremely useful book if you have studied nonverbal communication at any length.This isn't a terrible book by any means; however, it is completely undeserving of a five-star rating."
5,A great metal CD,"Jag Panzer are one of America's best metal bands today. They are true metal, sounding a bit like a mix of trash and power metal (the vocals especially would make you think it's power metal). The lead guitar work on this album is great and ""The Tyrant's"" vocals are great. If you like metal, buy this CD! The best songs are Take To The Sky, Frozen In Fear, and The Scarlet Letter."
4,One of the best introductions to the subject,This is one the best introductory textbooks on the subject of financial markets and institutions. It is comprehensive and full of examples and exercises. The authors do an excellent job of presenting complex concepts in a relatively simple and straightforward style. Highly recommended.
1,One of the worst written books on the subject,"The idea to have a broad but thorough overview of different financial markets is brilliant. However, the author has real talent to make relatively simple ideas incomprehensible. Overall, the book is very difficult to read, language and wording are terrible."
1,pity they cannot comunicate,clearly written by a pair of highly intelligent intellectuals. it is a pity they cannot comunicate.
2,Two Stars For Interesting Concept,"I am giving this album two stars, for an interesting concept. This band would have been good if they had not made common 'Metal Band' mistakes.Though they play their instruments well, it kinda ruins it if the music sounds like it was played in a garage and recorded by tape recorder and later moved to CD.It addition to the lead singer leaving much to be desired, the band has a backup singer who does nothing but scream, this is one of the most annoying Heavy Metal clichés.Also the album is not very long, I doubt it is even thirty minutes in length. At least you get nice cover art."
5,fast shipppping!,"i looked everywhere for this product. im so glad i found it on here for a great price. this product is AMAZING to say the least. gets precise straightness. and cuts down the time in half for my straightening time. works WELL with a chi straightener. zero frizz. i have nappy hair, so this does its job and MORE.ordered on a wednesday and came on a saturday. looking forward to doing business with them. I LOVE SCRUPLES.check it out for yourself and youll be glad u did."
2,harsh standards,"I have 'harsh standards' for games, and considering when the game was made, it has a handicap to start with. But this doesn't effect to what degree I enjoyed the game (as in thinking about such circumstances doesn't increase the game's value or enjoyment for me). It was meh."
4,really good but a copy,this game was really good the graphics were okay but when they talked it had poor little comic balloons and it was a major copy of the nintindo64's the legend of zeida!
2,Unless you have a six-string bass...,"don't buy this tape. Although a few exercises you can adjust to a four-string bass, most require you to own a six-string bass. That or doing a lot of tuning up and down."
5,Traditional Indian Crafts,I found this book extremely helpfull for the bigginer leathercrafter. The illustrations and photographs are beautifully done. The intructions are very easy to follow. This book is a must-all for any one desiring to learn all aspects of working with leather.
5,Good packaging as well as content,"I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays, I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose, and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel, With Soothing Aloe, 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day, and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists, and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well, delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray, and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)"
3,It's water that you spray up your nose...!!!,"I bought these after a trip to Houston, TX where my nasal cavities cleared substantially. I've been in California a lot lately thought ""Wow, the humidity substantially cleared my nostrils, maybe they're irritated because they're dry all the time"".I'm usually nasally congested during the day (contributed to by a deviated septum).I've tried small scale humidifiers which don't seem to do much for me and I read all sorts of rave reviews about ""Saline Nasal Mist"" and how they magically clear your nostrils.Anyways, this was not a cure-all panacea that I hoped for, works about as well for me as blowing my nose out with regular water in the shower every morning."
5,An Excellent Product!,"For some years I've had repeated sinus infections. Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive. I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray, it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the ""job"" for me!"

1,Terrible Product,"I don't know how anyone can recommend this, unless the reviews are faked.This product sucks. It's difficult to spray. It stings the inside of my nose. It's just awful."
3,Not A Mist,"I ordered this when I couldn't find the 4-Way saline spray at a decent price.These probably work well for you if you want to use them as drops or dont mind a stream type delivery.I dont like the feel of the stream compared to the mist type so I probably wouldn't order again for that reason.I had trouble with it dripping from my nose as I was squeezing the bottle where as the mist type doesnt do this.Since I dont like leaning my head back to use nasal spray its not a good product for me personally.The product itself is fine overall.I dont like the longer,skinny tip compared to the short,wider,type on the 4-Way.Very good price for six large bottles though."
5,A thought-provoking and informatively extensive study,"The Lindisfarne Gospels: Society, Spirituality & The Scribe by Celtic and Anglo-Saxon cultural history expert Michelle P. Brown (Curator of Illuminated Manuscripts at The British Library), examines this important and influential eighth-century book in the light of both theological analysis and revelations of the latest archaeological finds. Marvelous color plates as well as black-and-white photographs wonderfully enhance the exhaustive, college-level text, which is a master piece of scholarship studying the genesis of the Lindisfarne Gospels, and how this classic was originally physically prepared, written, and bound, as well as the significance of its art, the nuances of its scripted text, and more. A thought-provoking and informatively extensive study, The Lindisfarne Gospels is also available in a soft-cover format."
1,Find better sources online for free,"Virtually all the material in this book, aside from Lennie Dee's introduction, is culled from other sources--at times without proper credit. The title comes from Johan Dada Vis' Exotiquarium site, much of the text is based on information at the Space Age Pop website, and a far better collection of cover art can be found at www.317x.com."
4,Swank!,"I purchased this to get mid-century graphic ideas, layouts and lettering and I was pleasantly surprised with the information that came with it. The text and foreward were very entertaining! I particularly enjoyed the ""Music for Gracious Living""..ever so posh!I wish it was a larger book ..so many ideas....so little time."
4,Cuthbertson helps you figure it out,"I've left Cuthbertson handy in my bathroom for the past 6 months. In that time, during spare moments, I've learned how almost everything on my bicycle works. It helped me immensely to break down the component groups into easily understood functions such as ""drivetrain"" -- and after all, why should understanding how a bicycle goes together be any more difficult than understanding how an internal combustion automobile goes together? When things get too ginchey, that seems to be the right spot for one of Morall's pen-and-ink sketches to show up. (My favorite is illustration 11-10, depicting the parts of a down-tube control lever, painstakingly sketched, and labeled as per the text as ""thingamabob,"" ""doodad,"" and ""mounting bolt."" ... Of course, the point was how fiendishly complicated such an arrangement can be.) The information is clearly presented, and differentiated among mountain, road, and ""cruiser"" bikes. I'll be moving the book down to my shop this week! :->"
3,Very informative,"This book has all of the information that I will probably ever need to keep my bike working in perfect condition. However, it has only a handful of ""drawing""-type illustrations. I need lots of pictures in a how-to book...especially one that is so technical."
2,Not the greatest book.,This book has a few primitive drawings but doesn't get into much detail. Some of the fixes I would not recommend unless you own an old beat up bike. They're really emergency fixes to help you get back home from a long ride. I recommend this book instead and Amazon has it:The Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance and Repair: For Road and Mountain Bikes
2,"A Classic In It's Time, But . . .","Anybody's Bike Book was a classic in it's time, but there are much better books out there today.I work on a lot of bikes and recently reviewed a bunch of bike repair books for a class I taught. I would recommend the Park Tool ""Big Blue Book of Bicycle Repair"" or ""Zinn and the Art of Road/Mountain Bike Maintenance"" over this book, even for a beginner."
4,pleased,"I am pleased with this purchase. It was less expensive than many others like it, and it arrived very quickly. It was comfortable, and lightweight. My only complaint is that I read somewhere that it rolls/folds up very small (10 inches or something) and it does not. It rolls up, but it is not compact. It is still 20'' long when you roll it up, and still kind of puffy."
4,I likes it alot!,It's a lovely body oil with a warm comforting scent; Not strong or perfumey at all. Put it on from neck to toe and your skin will feel nourished and silky smooth. It's Buttery Vaniilla scent will make you feel like a tasty dish for that special someone :)I definitely will keep using this product for years to come!
3,"Good Bottles, Priced High","Like these water bottles a lot and already had the carriers, but expensive for only 6 bottles in package. I couldn't find anywhere in Product description where it stated how many bottles... it just indicated bottles - plural. Hopefully they will add how many in future so others know."
5,Great Movie!,"Just watched on TCM and I'm ordering...very contemporary piece for its time, and deals with 'passing' as an everyday occurrence. Loved this movie."
5,Excellent Resource for Couples Therapists,"As a couples therapist, I am always interested in expanding my knowledge and skills as a clinician. This book has proven to be an excellent resource for me. Greenberg and Johnson have written a book that is both theoretically interesting and a useful guide for practice. Their emphasis is on helping couples learn how to acknowledge and communicate their emotions to each other, and they offer a very comprehensible outline of the steps involved in working with emotions in couples therapy. This book also has excellent clinical examples which show how these ideas look in practice. Highly recommended!"
3,Not that interesting,When it first came out this book might have presented something new. It is overpriced and not well written. You will learn more from Susan Johnson's books that cover more ground on attachment disorders that effect couples.
4,Helpful,I have severe arthritis and have difficult sitting down and standing up. This devise is a great help. The reason for the 4 stars is that it is wobbly because of the loose connections but it is still plenty strong. To make a firm devise of this kind would probably cost much more.
3,can not use with our toilets,"I loved this idea for my husband with Lewy Body dementia and ordered it as soon as I saw it.Our two toilet seats are the type that when you put the seat & or lid down, it gently closes by itself. It can also be taken off as one unit to clean the toilet and the seat assemble entirely.The attachment for this safety frame under the seat bolts cannot work with this kind of seat attachment. Too bad, its a great price & a really good idea. Especially when there is not enough room in the toilet area to use a portable commode."
4,Good quality for the money,"Got this Safety Frame from my 85 year old mother when we upgraded her toilet to a high rise. It was so good looking that she actually remarked on how 'pretty' it was! It has been in a couple of months and seems to holding up well so far though she has to put her weight on it fully to get up. But -- she is only 100 lbs, so don't know how it would function for a larger person. Satisfied with purchase and the price beat any store in town. Only four stars because the fifth star can only be earned by a long-lasting product and it's too soon to tell."
2,Poor packaging,I returned this item because it came so poorly packaged for shipping. The box was really in bad shape and all the parts were all over the place. At first the company was going to charge be a 25% restocking fee to return it but Amazon.com took care of that for me.
1,not invacare,"When I ordered this product I thought I was going to receive a Invacare Product not a MEDLINE. I have tried A INVACARE toilet safety frame before, there is adjustments in the front and back for height, this one only has the back adjustment. If you have a raised toile seat this one is fine, If not forget It and get one from INVACARE."
4,I like it,"It does what it is supposed to do. Sit there and look pretty. LOL Arrived quickly, nice product. I would purchase it again."
4,"Great Doll, Great Value!",I purchased this Lilo doll for my 2 year old daughter who LOVES Lilo and Stitch. She was VERY excited to receive this doll for her birthday and it's just the right size to her Stitch doll.
2,whoa,I got this doll a few years ago and wanted another for new grandbaby... but they are now $65!! are you freaking kidding me? This is a stuffed doll!!!
4,Excellent watch--funky color,"I love this watch. It is the second one I have purchased after owning my first one for years (it died when I went to Hawaii and moisture penetrated it somehow--maybe because I accidentally banged it super hard right before we went on our trip? It has been waterproof for years before the massive bang.). The ONLY problem with this watch is the color. The white part is not a true white, but a weird creamy color that just looks odd. I am going to buy this same watch in a different color."
2,Do not buy!,"I cannot believe the reviews of this game! For one, the PSX version of the game is so much better in terms of game play. I must admit that the PS2 graphics are stunning but c'mon! There is more to a game than just good looks.For one, taking the BMW-Williams, the car does not have the real top speed of the real F1 car. And when qualifying, you are not able to advance the time. Am I expected to sit infront of the game for an actual hour??? Also, you are unable to watch the competition's lap time. Then, EA removes the level of modification allowed on the car. In the PSX version, you can control the amount of steering lock. That is now removed. For me to negotiate a sweeper, I have to induce lift throttle oversteer. And that, my friends, is a bunch o' BS! This game is not a similation. It is now a not so fun and boring arcade game! I regret buying this game and in the process of trying to sell it! I will stick to playing the PSX version on my PS2 console!"
2,F1 Championship PS2,"I have to agree with nismofreak. I am a die hard F1 fan, I have every F1 game made for playstation. The one for PSX to me plays better. You can see other drivers qualify and also see their split times. In this all that happens is the qualifying times show up. The grafics are outstanding but thats it. The engine noise is annoying, gear selection is poor. They also really need blow by blow commentary. this is what Psygnosis has in their F1 that makes it more fun. ""Rent first then but."""
2,Disappointing,I have played F1 simulations of eidos interactive in my PC.I bought the PS2 mainly to play this F1 game. The graphics are very good and it seems weirdly real in cockpit view. Unfortunately graphics is the only plus for this game. The gameplay is really very disappointing.There is not even a REARVIEW mirrow..How am i supposed to block somebody trying to pass me ???? There is very little talk from the pit ..and i have to wait for the TV display (which appears occassionally)to know whether somebody's gaining on me or not ...or where my championship contender is!!!! Even psygonesis PSX game had better gameplay. If somebody is planning on buying this game..my advice is wait for F1 2002..maybe EAsports will come up with something better. ppl who are planning to buy PS2 for playing F1 sims..stick to ur PC.
3,"Pretty good for F1 fans, but there are better driving games.","I got this game when I first got my PS2. Now, I'm sure I liked this game more than most and forgave it for its flaws because I'm such a F1 fan. It is a fun game and the tracks are very realistic (when watching an F1 race I would know the track perfectly when watching an in-car shot after playing the track on this game). The graphics are nice as well. The crashes are a little absurd, but amusing nonetheless. I do say the Gran Turismo 3 is the best driving game on the PS2 or any other system.(...)Anyway, if this gets through... Grand Prix 3 and the Thrustmaster on a PC makes for the best racing/driving sim game I've ever played. See my reviews on amazon for those items as well."
1,UNHAPPY and DISPLEASED,I ordered the product that is shown in the image (BLACK CAN) but i received a totally different product. contacted shipper and they never sent me a return label and I called them three times. Now I am stuck with multiple cans of a deoderant that no-one I know uses. I will never buy from AMAZON again.
3,.,"I know beggars can't be choosers, but I can't help it...This book has a lot of my 5 star tags but Kinsale just didn't seem to know what to do with them. I liked the deaf-mountain-man-hermit thing and the emotionally-unstable thing but these were so inconsistent that it wasn't even entertaining. The leading man would go from a gimpy puss to Zoro in a split second; I would have rathered he stay the gimpy puss, he was likable then.Also, just as a PS, this is one of those travel books where the whole time is spent trying to get to 'that place' or to find 'that person.' I have no patients for that theme. I think every book, no matter the era it's set in, should have Star Trek technology where everyone just beams to where they want to be."
5,This book was great!,"I have read all of Laura Kinsale's novels. I saw ""The Prince of Midnight"" in a grocery store back in 91. I practically ran to it. The cover was absolutely gorgeous. Fabio was on the cover sitting on a horse. This cover was the first romance novel to show a man without a woman. The storyline was interesting, different than others I have read. I have read and re-read this novel so many times that I had to end up buying a hardcover edition. I also recommend Brenda Joyce's Scandouls Love. Its too bad most romance novels today don't have the dashing prince with the damsel in distress on the covers. Pictures are what attracts me first, then I read the back for the storyline. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed."
5,definitely a keeper!!,"What a charmer! This was a pleasant surprise in a world of stereotypical strong macho men romances. I won't go over the story because the other reviewers already have but suffice it to say that the characterisation is wonderful, the heroism is not overblown and the human flaws are honestly and openly dealt with. Lovely."
2,Tried my patience,"I understand the heroine was heart hardened from being traumatized and hurt. However, after continually rebuffing the hero for almost the entirety of the book, I'd had enough. She irritated me to know end. I could not figure out what the hero saw in her. The hero also annoyed me with his clingy wounded dog routine. Also adding to my general dislike for this book was the hero's convenient turn around. (don't want to spoil any plot points). I quit by chp 21. I had so little invested in these characters that I didn't even read the epilogue. I'll give it @ least 2 stars because kinsale's writing style is wonderful. Sorry but I don't mind being in the minority on this one."
5,One of the Best Albums Ever!!!!!!!!,"Every song on here is a classic!! I love this cd to death!! Three 6 Mafia had the evil, dark sound back in 1995 and were on Prophet Entertainment when this came out. This is by far their best album. You will never hear another album like this in your life. This is the best album ever made along with Master P's ""Ice Cream Man."" This album is definitely not for the kiddies or the faint at heart. For everyone else that likes dark melodies from some tight rappers, get this album now!!! You will not regret it, trust me!!!!!!"
3,good start,"I just wish they had waited until they had better equipment to record it on. Definitely some of the best lyricism ever to be put onto a rap CD, particularly Lord Infamous' and Koopsta Knicca's lines. D.J. Paul did some lyrical tricks too, but Gangsta Boo and Juicy J did too much ""gangsta"" and not enough horror-core. I want the satanic evil brutality stuff about mutilation and torture, not people getting shot! That's too quick. (I'm not into Satan worship or anything, I just like lots of brutality in my music). Therefore, this is definitely something every Three 6 Mafia fan should have, but I'd recommend buying ""The End"" first."
2,FREAKY V 2000,I GUESS THEY ARE OKAY REALLY THE ONLY SONGS I LIKE ON THERE IS TEAR THA CLUB UP BUT IF YOU LIKE NOTHIN BUT RAPPIN NO SINGING THEN BUY IT
5,Mystic Stylez,"This is a classic Three 6 Mafia release. I can't believe it's average rating is 4 stars, considering it's probably their best album. It's their most hardcore album, the beats are completely off the hook, and the lyrics (as many ppl have put it) u could say are their most 'devilish'. My favorite song has got to be the title track. The beat is one of my favorite beats. They flow awesome too. Other favorites are Porno Movie which has an incredible feel to it, Live By Yo Rep which is an awesome dis at bone thugs, who although i do like, this song kills them, and Tear Da Club Up. All Three 6 Mafia fans should own this, so should any fans of hardcore rap."
1,Not all that great.,wish I hadnt bought it. I like thier newer stuff and mixed stuff but this bored me to death. beats were ok. vocals sucked
4,Triple 6's First Come Up,This is one of my favorite Triple 6 albums...reason being that its one of their grimiest...hardcore..get buck..really underground sounding albums besides underground vol.2..which isnt that great anyway.But you can really see the quality in this album when you listen to it.My favorites are Break the Law 95..Da Summa..In Da Game..Back Against the Wall..Gotta Touch Em pt2..and theirs no forgetting Tear the Club Up..a song that i think the Triple 6 was made first famous from. Good album with hardcore beats and lyrics to get crunk to..but there are a few filler tracks. If your looking to build a triple 6 collection..I recommend starting with this album.
3,OK just a little eerie,"I like this album but dont listen to alone.....just playin, this album is good especially the song da summer and the bone dis pretty solid CD"
1,and I just thought I had read the worst Lee books!!!,"Not until I read this ""piece"" did I realize that the worst R. E. Lee book was this by A. M. Gambone. It is filled with so many false and inaccurate statements about every aspect of Lee's life and generalship, that I believe that the author hasn't the slightest clue about what he writes. As proof, how'bout one such example...let's take the author's last point in the book on page 211. Gambone states that ""Lee's fatal managerial talent"" can be summed up in these words: ""A strong propensity to avoid ugly reality which was coupled with a lack of discipline."" No serious historian would pen such nonsense...and it is a perfect example of why this book qualifies as the worst possible history imaginable."
2,Lee Bashing with a New a spin,"I had not read much about Gettysburg until recently. While visiting Gettysburg, I found this book. Wanting to know more about Gettysburg, I purchased this book. I was quickly disapointed. Gambone first parades across the pages various Lee Defenders. He then compares Lee and those who chose to fight for the South as Benedict Arnolds! At that point, This book lost all interest with me.He attacks what are called Lee's Victories. Questioning his ability, his tactics etc...It is always easy to critisize a man when you look back. At Gettysburg Lee made mistakes. But he was HUMAN! Gambone should take himself off his altar and come and live with the rest of us who make mistakes!Overall this book I think is a poor treatment of the Battle of Gettysburg. That is why I DO NOT recommend it to anyone! I suggets the book entitled "" Last Chance for Victory by Bowden & Ward "" as a more eyeopening treatment of the Gettysburg operation."
4,Magic Man,"Magic Man was a magic song for me. Loved it, loved it. Back in around 1980 or 81. I've been looking for this song and could never find it until now. There are singers and there are non-singers. Robert Winters can sing and this love song can make you believe."
3,No es tan bueno,"No colmó mis expectativas. Creo que le faltan más fotos y colorido. Demasiado texto, y pocas imágenes. No era lo que esperaba"
4,good overview of Photoshop Cs2,"Really this book is a 'getting to know cs2' book. It goes through most of the features and gets you familair with them. the techniques he demonstrate, seem more suite toward an artist rather and a photographer and there are better book out there if you are looking for something aimed at a photographer. Still it is a good reference book, and does show some neat stuff."
1,Poor Instruction Manual,"This book comes with a CD of sample images you are to work on while going through the book. However, as the author proceeds to work on an image and goes through the steps, he never indicates the file or name of the image you are supposed to use. So for every tutorial, you need to go through all the image files and look for the right one. It's much, much easier when (as in most of these types of books) the text says: ""open Imagename.jpg"". Having to go through the files on the cd slows you down each and every time especially when you're guessing as to what the name of the file is. I'm sure there's useful information in here, but it's just a pain to get to. Instead I would recommend as an all-in-one beginner's guide to Photoshop CS2 the ""One On One"" book."
5,Adobe Photoshop CS2 Studio Techniques,This book is very good. Ben Willmore is an expert of expert. Buy it and it will not make you disappoited.
4,Learning the tough parts of Photoshop,I've been using the book as a reference text. It has been very helpful in some tough selection techniques such as isolating the outline of hair (8 pages of detail). It is also useful in reviewing the basics. Many alternate techniques are available in Photoshop. This book has them in great detail.
5,Excelent guide to Photoshop,"I bought the book because it was a required textbook for a class on Photoshop I am taking. I have two other book on Photoshop, but this one clearly became my favorite. It is written in easy and understandable language. I downloaded all the practice picture so I learn using the same pictures as the author. If you are looking for a excellent book on Photoshop do not look further. This is the one."
5,Technical Writng As It Should Be,"Ben is that rare teacher who makes his subject clear for anyone, beginner or advanced user. He will not remain on my shelf, but in my travel bag and by the computer. This book will be well used and look it. Don't hesitate. Push the buy now button. You will not regret it. I am not related and have no financial interest in the book!!!!!!! Join the enlightened!!!!"
4,Visiting College Campuses,Great service. The book was in excellent condition and arrived within the stated delivery time.
4,"It's a HOMM game, nothing more and nothing less...","The Heroes of Might and Magic Chronicles series were mainly created for people who are new to the HoMM games. Therefore, as a veteran player ever since the first HoMM game, I found the campaign rather easy. However, if you've never played a HoMM game before, the chronicles series are an excellent place to begin (just make sure you know what you're getting into because you've got some sleepless nights ahead of you). Even for veteran players, if you set the difficulty on impossible, they may find this particular campaign enjoyable since the story is nicely woven and one can't help but wonder what lies next for our hero, Tarnum. The only thing that would make me hesitate in buying this product is the fact that my local software store is selling HoMM millenium edition (HoMM 1-3) for 19.99, which is a much better deal than paying the same price for one campaign."
3,Just a notice for intrested players,"I have played HoMM over since the orignal came out (could never get into Might and Magic though), and i enjoy stragity based games to where out of the fifty games 35 are stragity games and 14 are RPG and one action. When I looked into buying and playing this game i felt exicted for another chapter of HoMM. I felt a little let down after installing and playing for a small amount of time. The reason is that I could not get into the game only 'cause the little blurbs that came up every time I ended my turn. Now I liked the stroy lines, its just that I had problems planing my next turn. But the game still plays the same and contuines to build on the orignals."
3,Great gift for my brother,My brother loved the under armour! It put a huge smile on his face on Christmas morning! Not to mention mine! It was cheap & delivered in 2 days! What more could you ask for!?
2,Too short in the torso,"Until now I have not gone with Under Armour due to sizing (the products are designed for those under 6 feet tall). After receiving two of these, I can tell you that the sizing issue has not been resolved. I also ordered Long Sleeve cold gear from another site that came today and those are perfect. Not sure why under armour does not make longer versions of their heat gear tops. I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for the right fit. These are going back."
1,Midway Deals a Bad Deal,"I ordered 2 Under Armour shirts for 2 of my grandsons for Christmas from Midway Deals thru Amazon. They arrived inside a cardboard box with no protective plastic or other wrap, no packing materials, just 2 shirts rattling around inside a cardboard box, period. Both shirts were damp, wrinkled, & one of them had a very visible stain on the front 4"" below the neckline. Way too late in the Christmas game to return them for replacement. The packing receipt said ""Brand New With Tags"" & ""Condition: New"" & there are tags on both shirts but the condition is NOT new. MIDWAY DEALS IS NO DEAL. I will not order from them again."
4,Great,"The shirt works just like I thought and hoped t would. Snugg fit, not uncomfortable. Thinking about getting the pants too."
2,Even too small for a compression shirt,"This compression shirt was way to small and to tight. I wear medium to large T-shirts so I had no concern about ordering a large compression shirt. After my workout the seems left marks under my arms and it was uncomfortable to wear. I will be giving it to my 12 year old son. I own a Nike, a Champion compression shirts that feel and work much better at about half the cost. I'll think twice next time and I'm not impressed with Under Armor."
3,puting it on,"these shirts are great, they did exactly what I expected them to do; keeping me cool, when hot and warm when cold. The unexpected thing was loosing some weight while wearing them all day. It definately helped me keep my stomach tight. It is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Fragile - will frey and wear out if you wear something over it and move a lot,"6'2"", 180 lbs, athletic build.I ride sportbikes and am an amateur racer. I have a full racing leather 1 piece suit and I wore this under said leathers. While it did a tremendous job of keeping me dry and cool, at the end of the day the material was pretty well mangled around my torso, probably from when I'd turn and pivot.I'm really disappointed with the durability of this shirt.I had a Nike compression top and an older Under Armor top (both now to small) and both never had this problem. I'm guess it's this new line. It's just not as high quality as it used to be. I'll probably switch back to Nike."
3,Runs much larger than the Cold Gear mock,"Have several Under Armour ColdGear mocks, which I've worn in a variety of climates. Figured I'd try out the HeatGear top, for giggles, and bought a couple in the same size (medium) as my existing ColdGear mocks.Unless my head has grown dramatically over the last year (I have been reading a lot of books), the neck opening on the HeatGear top is much smaller and less stretchy than its ColdGear cousin. Once I finally did manage to weasel my noggin' through the hole (I felt like I was being birthed by some supernatural nylon being), I found the sleeves to be loose-fitting and a bit long. I looked more like a sporty medieval peasant in a polyester smock than a serious athlete whose cooling properties needed enhancing.Under Armor was very helpful and gladly accepted my return. I will stick to the CoolGear product for now; snug fit and great water-wicking capabilities keep my temperature regulated across a variety of climates."
3,Material was different from others advertised.,"I bought one two weeks before and it was a cloth material. the sieze was medium yet it fitted very large. I liked it though so i deceided to purchase another, a small since the medium was still large. On doing so i got a silk material top that was extremly small. Its nice i do admit but it fits my girlfriend not me."
3,Thinner than I was expecting,The item was a little bit thinner in terms of material than I had anticipated. The shirt overall is pretty much as advertised however...
3,Middle Of The Road,"It's nice to have DVD's of these games, but unfortunately the video quality, even on the 2006 ALCS game, is actually less than my VHS copies of these games. The video has obviously been compressed a bit and as such the quality is merely O.K."
3,An Okay Collection,"I like the menus and ability to select any half inning.No doubt there are other great moments to include in a collection like this. But, why put in a video of the last game at Tiger Stadium? The location deserves to be remembered by its great moments and games, not its final game.The context is not properly set concerning Game 5 of 1968 - this would have been the end of the series and it was the beginning of a comeback while down 3-1 for the Tigers. Without a little research most people would be unaware of this significance and the announcers don't make much of it either. Why was this game not in color? The announcers even say ""This game is brought to you live and in color by NBC.""The quality of the videos is compressed to fit onto DVD.Overall, a fun and worthwhile buy for the price. Let's hope they come out with something a little more thorough with improved quality in the future."
5,Great,Great product no matter what level of fan you are. The speed of delivery was as advertised and the quality of the product as advertised also. Will definately buy again from this seller.
5,A southern man full of soul sings to his wife.....,"Simply put, this album is great! Dave Barnes is a talented singer/songwriter and this time out he writes of his recently wed wife and their relationship (except for the break up song). Dave sounds very comfortably as he moves through these songs. His sound this time is less based around his acoustic guitar (although it is there) but more the musicians that play with him. Chasing Mississippi comes away with more of this funky blues rock feel to it; however, it still feels like Dave Barnes. This album feels more like a next step him I think. The quality of the production itself is very good. It doesn't feel like an independent record at all. Ed Cash did a good job producing this one for Dave. If you like singer/songwriters, soulful singers, or just good music then check this album out. Then after that check out his other album."
2,Too small and too fragile -- not recommended,"I bought these jumpers for use in my SATA drives. These jumpers are very small. I think they are shorter than the pins themselves. Once you push them into the drive, it's extremely hard to take them back out. Also, they are much more fragile than other jumpers that I have used in the past. I was holding one of them with a needle-nose plier. Without using any force, the top of the jumper collapsed. Luckily, there are more in the bag, and I learned really quick how fragile these things are. The price is cheap, but shipping is not. All-in-all, I do not recommend these. Next time, I will have to find something a little sturdier."
4,Impressive debut album for this R&B artist,"LJ (aka Lil' Johnny)'s album may have been unreleased by Warner Bros last year, but if you can get a copy, you should listen to it. His album is reminiscent of Usher's ""My Way"" album in that a lot of the songs are great and uptempo. His slower jams are also some of the songs to check out on the CD. My favorite picks: ""I Got You"" ""Hang It Up"" ""Curfew"" ""Wheel Of Fortune"" ""Dance Dance"" and ""That's What I'm Talkin About"" (featuring Lil' Zane)."
2,another reason to buy a dreamcast,this is not nba basketball if you want nba basketball buy nba2k1 nuff said!!!
2,Sega NBA2k1 made a much better game than Sony,"MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED!!!!!!!For all old school NBAlive heads you got what you wanted, your old game back again with a slight facelift. For a system with a 128bits, you would think that E.A. could have improved the graphics a lot with all the time they had to work on it. Game play has not change at all and this disappoints me the most about this game. The need for a ""dunk"" button is ridiculous. Why can't you just go to the whole and score according to their skill. The only change that's noticed in the graphics is on the action replay. The only props I'm given for this game is the cross over dribble, Sega could have done better. Over all the Nba2k1 is a much, much better game. If you're able to put these 2 games (NBAlive & NBA2k1) side by side, you noticed right off that Sega spent more time in the designed room."
2,A Reason To Keep Your Dreamcast,"The slow-moving, confined NBA Live 2001 is one of the biggest reasons that I have not yet decided what I think of the PS2 and am so deeply distressed over the discontinuation of the Dreamcast. Between Live, the former leader in NBA games for Genesis, Super Nintendo, and even later systems like Playstation and N64, declines rapidly in the transition. Much as the 989 studio games all very sharply declined, EA games with the exception of the flagship Madden Football and NHL2001 have all translated poorly to this new system. This game, apart from sharpness of graphics and a mild increase in game speed shows little improvement from its predecessors and a decline in game play. I will check out 2002 in hopes of an improvement, but thus far the best NBA game for PS2 is ESPN Bball 2Night (not much better). If you only buy one basketball game this year, it should be NBA2K1 or 2 for Dreamcast."
3,Just like NBA Live 2000,"NBA Live 2001 hardly has any improvement over the 2000 version. You can see some minor improvement on players' facial details, but other than that, everything else is basically the same. In the 2000 release, one could make a custom team, but in the 2001 release, you can't. And the interface is smoother yet harder to understand. If you already have 2000, just keep playing that one until 2002 release comes out (hopefully, 2002 will be less dissapointing than the 2001 release. But if you don't have the 2000 release, i'd recommend that you get the 2001 release. Overall, the game is still fun and more realistic than any other basketball games out there."
5,a better game then you think,"Out of all the reviews people are complaining about the franchise. Instead of making a dream team, why dont you play the season how it is in the nba. The graphics are amazing. The game has a lot of detail. The players have the jersy all uptated for example the names are clear on the back. The only minor deteil is they are mising a head coach. These are all the complaints and they are all stupid ones. I think this is a great b-ball game."
2,NBA Live is a major disappoinment!,"As an owner of 3 other EA Sports PS2 games(Madden, NHL, and F1) I can honestly tell you that I am gravely bummed out. I wish that I had rented this first. Basketball is a difficult game to recreate but this reminds me of my old 1st and 2nd generation playstation games, slow and unrealistic. I am also majorly disappointed with the graphics. All of the stuff on the commercial is from replay movies. Most players lok unlike themselves. A major flaw is what should have been a major success, the back down option. When backing down a player you run straight out of bounds when you go to shoot about 26% of the time. I hope Knockout Kings isn't as disappointing. I will rent it first."
1,Don't buy this game,"I have a Dreamcast and a Playstation 2 and except for maybe 2 or 3 titles I think the Dreamcast is winning in the gaming department. I bought NBA live and was very upset with everthing but the graphics. Now a days we expect great graphics what we want is game play, and in this area NBA Live 2001 hits the bottom of the fish pond. NBA2k1 is far, far superior in every aspect. I believe next year the makers of P2 games will finally use the potential of the system but for today they are not. So with that said if you want to play basketball go get NBA2K1 and leave NBA Live 2001 on the store shelves."
1,all the hyp for nothing!!,"I am a big NBA live fan, and i tell you this is not worth your time! I have playd LIVE since it was on supernintendo, and this game is a waste! The graphics are crisp, but the moves are slow, the play control is in no comparison the other versions of live on the PS1. PLEASE do not encourage the purchasing of this game!! EA sports did a HORRIBLE job, after madden 2001 they give us this weak title....."
3,What happened?,NBA Live has consistantly been the best basketball game on the market and every year new things are added. Untill now. This years version is just average. The game looks great and the players are very detailed and the new post up option is great. Unfortunatly the 1 on 1 mode is very boring. Another downer is that the players dont have thier actuall faces and the three point shootout is missing. The games season option lost some of its appeal without a franchise mode available. I hope EA uses this game as a stepping stone and improves on it next year by adding some new modes and working on the gameplay. Despite these few let downs the game is still a blast when playing with a group of friends and a multi-tap.
4,Sweet game,"It is very good. But the players don't look like the players real faces.Also, they took of the three point contest. Overall, it's an A game. EA Sports improve the game evey release and this game they made it a better.I hope next realease it will have more contest like slam dunk, sophomores vs. rookies."
3,other misses,"i forgot to complain that there are no coaches, the fans arent animated, no real chants or boos, the audio of the arenas such as indy cars in indy are missing. alternate jerseys?Draft, salary cap, free agency, trade offers from other teams.Essentially, give us the real game."
4,Better than what people make it seem...,"This game is much better than what a lot of people make it. It's a complete game with great graphics...Well, they could have left out the game intro where everyone is dancing around like it's a ""I Feel Like Chicken Tonight"" commercial but that's ok, that's what the Start button is for. Everyone is pretty much as good in this game as they are in real life which is much different from other basketball titles I care not to mention. Overall, if you are a slight fan of the series, it's still worth the purchase. A good buy!"
2,FLAGRANT FOUL!,"This is a terrible game, not what I expected for a PS2 game made by one of the better known gaming companies EA sports. The graphics are ok, sometimes some of the players look the same, not to realistic IMHO. The worst part of it is, the gameplay.They seem unresponsive at times and takes awhile getting used to (that is if you don't quit before that) I gave NBA 2K1 a 3 1/2 stars for DC, but after playing NBA LIVE It's a 4 1/2. Save your money and cross your fingers for next years release, or if you have a DC pick up NBA 2k1! Bottom Line NBA LIVE is an AIR BALL! Grade: D GAMER247 is OUT!"
3,Please Listen to Me,"Ok, I have played so many sports games that it is ridiculous, I don't like role playing games or fantasy sports games like NFL biltz. I like authentic games. This game is far from authentic basketball or a fantasy sport game. The graphics are very lack luster for PS2. Some people will tell you otherwise but they are in a dream land, wake up people. The gameplay is extremely sloppy. Defensive rebounding is a joke, it is extemely impossible on free throws, and lose balls are tough to get because the players won't get the ball. Three pointers are nonexistent on tough levels and practically so are regular two pointers. I played the computer on the toughest level and both I and the computer shot 20% from the field. So the scoring was low and not because of outstanding defense but of missed shots that should be made in the low post, the only way to score is a running shot or dunk. A turn and shot with shaq, duncan, or garnett will not fall, it is extremely pathetic and annoying."
1,This game sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As a loyal fan of EA Sports products I said I would give this game a chance even though I had read all the bad reviews it had received. I was expecting Madden 2001 game play when I bought the game, but what I got was Nintendo Double Dribble! . They (EA Sports) really jerked us with this game. First they give us Kickamus Maximus whatever... and then they deliver this. The controls are horrible and the actual game play is so unrealistic that this game could have waited for release in 2002. Please rent it from Blockbuster first; do not waste your money! It sucks."
3,Gamer,"If the graphics weren't so good, this would be called NBA Live 2000. That being said, you can take it or leave it. If you liked last year's version, then you'll like this one. I don't think that this will convert non EA NBA Live fans however. All in all it's a solid game with few suprises."
1,Are You Kidding Me??,"I was truly stunned once I opened the game. Bought it on the release date and returned it the same day. I would not give anybody advice to pick this game up. Slow gameplay, the list can go on. Just plain awful! Do not give EA any reason to think this was a success. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Pull out the old Genesis and give that a play. Its almost no different. Thanks EA for going all out on this one!"
1,Yawn!,"I just rented LIVE 2001 PS2. Played the Knicks - Heat into overtime. Should have been exciting, right? Wrong! This game is missing something - - the ""fun factor!"" Although for the most part the players and arenas look nice, player control is a bit awkward (just TRY grabbing a rebound on either end!), and the computer AI is just terrible (I lost count as to how many times the computer had a shot-clock violation). This game's ho-hum clunkiness reminded me a lot of my first LIVE purchase for PS1 - the '97 edition. Hopefully (as with the PS1 editions), the PS2 versions will become more exciting in the future. As for now, this game's a snoozer, and suffers in comparison to fine EA titles like MADDEN and SFX."
3,This game is OKAY!,"Hi! This game is okay, it has good music and graphics. But what stinks is that there is not three point shootout and slamdunk contest. You can play one on one, season, playoffs, and exhibition. This game is not a must want. Thanks for reading. Hope this was helpful."
3,This game is OKAY!!!!!,"Hi! This game is okay, it has good music and graphics. Bu what stinks is that there is not three point shootout and slamdunk contest. You can play one on one, season, playoffs, and exhibition. This game is not a must want. Thanks for reading. Hope this was helpful."
1,EA Fails to live up to expectations,"Just plain bad. Game play is choppy, camera angles aren't great, player close-ups and intermediate shots are annoying, and much, much more. In short, I felt I waisted my money. Stick to playing NBA2K1 until something decent comes to the PS2 console. I can't wait till Sega puts out a game for PS2."
1,...,"SHOuld be zero stars. Between herky player movements and terrible gameplay (shooting and rebounding) this is the most disappointing title I have seen EA release in quite some time. DO NOT BUY, this is a very poor title. If you liked NBA2k, you will think this is the worst game you have played. It's going back the same day i bought it."
2,NBA LIVE 2001 for the PS2,"I am deeply disappointed! I had been waiting for this release since November and there is a major problem with the game, it is not improved from the PS1 model with slight graphic improvements, the game is slow, non competitive NO CHALLENGE and as much as I hate to do so - it is at BEST an average game! Don't waste your time, the Dreamcast NBA2K1 is just as bad though their graphics are crispier, the faces are very realistic! I'm disappointed, ..."
4,Worth it to buy!,"My only complaint is that the player graphics don't compare to Madden 2001, the player rendering is maybe a step or two above the PSone graphics. The players are not as smooth graphically or as detailed as Madden but it is better than most games I have seen or played including the Dreamcast. All the players are skinny and to get a good camera view of the game you have to zoom out and this makes everything a little smaller than I would like. Overall game play I think is wonderful, real life movements, i.e crossovers spin moves etc....I really like the new lowpost moves especially up and under and spin moves which I could never master on the earlier versions. Still a must buy and hopefully EA is listening and will get the graphics right next year."
1,nba dead 2001,"This is the worst video game I've ever played! The worst! I'me not sure what the right camera for a basketball game is, but this isn't it! The game play is duscusting. It has only mediocre graphics. None of your team mates can catch any passes, and you stop running when you get the ball. The commentating is horrible. In a spurs- lakergame, on one end, he'll say chris webber is getting all the rebounds. Then he'll say the lakers are dominating on the boards. It is reppetitive also."
2,A Disappointing Franchise,"I have bought every NBA LIVE game since I've had a Super Nintendo and every year EA has made great improvements, except for now. I read and re-read the instructions and couldnt believe that they got rid of the things that made this game great. The franchise mode was the best thing for NBA Live 2000. They also got rid of the 3 point contest and instead added nothing to the game except slightly better graphics. Why oh why did they eliminate the best feature of the game. Isnt it a must for sports games? When TRIPLE PLAY 2001 comes out I hope they dont screw it up and leave out the franchise mode and the home run derby. Whoever decided to get rid of these aspects should have been fired.Game play is more realistic because teams dont shoot 70% like they use to in older versions. Except for improved graphics, NBA LIVE 2000 FOR THE PS1 IS A BETTER GAME."
1,NBA LIVE ...,"To keep this short and simple, dont even rent this game. Thisgame ... -my atari basketball game is more fun to play. Seriously. What were the producers of this game on when they were creating this game???"
3,Hmmmm.....,"I already have NBA LIVE 2000 for PS1, I thought I'd buy this for it's improved graphics, so the lack of a franchise and challenge mode doesn't bother me much (I can play them in 2000). But I can imagine for the gamers new to the LIVE series, this may be a problem...it depends on if you are into real basketball or fun-to-play basketball"
4,Chill Out!!,"This game is a lot of fun and for a first edition game on the playstation 2 what more could you ask for. The movement is a little slow and the camera angles need tweaking but to say that it is ""just a little better than the PS1"" is absurd. The graphics are great and the sound rocks. Boo Hoo, no franchise mode. There are like thirty teams in the NBA, use one of them, and if you want something more release players and sign them on to the team you want. It aint perfect but its a helluva lot more fun than russian roulette. I remember when I had to walk seven miles in the snow with no shoes or a jacket to play Coleco Vision. This game is smokin' like JR Rider in the back of a Mercedes with a Coke can."
3,Check out games.ign.com review of it,They give it a 7.4 out of a 10.There is no franchise mode and the players faces and heads look nothing like the real ones.I have a preorder on this game and this game sounds dissapointing.
1,Don't bother,"I wish I could get my money back. I am a huge fan of EA Sports games, but this is very disappointing."
1,Major Dissappointment,"After playing Madden 2001 for PS2, I was really looking forward to NBA Live 2001 by EA Sports. So far it has been a major dissappointment for me and a waste of money. The game play is very slow, game menus not only look weird but also are not very user friendly. The one bright spot for the game is that the graphics are pretty during game play. If your considering buying this game I would definately rent it before buying so you know how your spending your money."
2,disappointing.........,"When I bought Live 2000 for the playstation, I thought it was the worst basketball game that EA has made in a while. I thought that they might have been saving all of their time and energy to develope Live 2001 for the PS2......I was wrong! It looks like EA spent all of their time developing Madden 2001 and they forgot everything about basketball. I don't really care that it does not have a franchise mode, but I am disappointed with the absence of the little things. The little things are what makes a game for me....such as crowd involvement, player reactions, coach reactions, crowd chants, etc...NBA2K is great because it has all of the little things that make it more real. Live is just making EA seem more like 989. Very disappointing, although I will still play it because it is the only NBA game out so far. Hopefully ESPN's NBA 2Night will be better. I doubt it...EA was supposed to be the leaders in sports games...WHAT HAPPENED???"
3,animated bench......where?????,"If you are a Live fan with a PS2 console, I'm sure you havebeen anxiously waiting for this game to be released. I bought it theday it came out and I can honeslty say that the gameplay is almostexactly like the gameplay of that of PSone, with one exception---thegraphics. By far I think the graphics are really good, but this gamewas supposed to be more animated with reactions from the bench andcoaches. Maybe my game is defective, but there are no coaches and theplayers on the bench just sit there. They don't get up and waive theirarms and cheer like the bench in NBA2K and 2K1. This is the biggestdisappointment with this game. Unless you have to unlock thesefeatures or if they are hidden somewhere..."
3,Same Old Live in a Prettier Package,"Received my copy yesterday and here are some observations. The interface is very clunky and poorly visible, similar to FIFA 2001 as compared to the clear menus in Madden 2001. The graphics have their moments, and there is no slowdown or breakup, but compared to Madden or SSX, Live looks PS1-ish. The gameplay is exactly like the recent editions of Live, it is fun to play, but after all these years the AI of your teammates is still at the Genesis level, no motion on offense, no boxing out. Also there is no challenge system or franchise mode, which is unforgivable compared to Madden."
3,nba live 2001,I bouth this game today.It's a good game but the camera view is bad.In playstation1 had better camera view.They should have behind camera view.It looks like you are in the game.
3,NBA Live 2001,"The reason I ranked this game so poorly is that for the so called ""power"" of a Playstaion 2, this game really is a big joke! The new moves and plays a great but the graphics look no better than that of Live 98. The reason it is a 3 is that i understand that the game just came out, but if The game came out in like a year, then the rate would be a big 0!"
1,What's this?,"In my video gaming life, I played many great game that had great technology and ideas. Also, I played many horrible games that deserves to be destroyed and sent into oblivion. Well, NBA Live 2001 deserves not only to be destroyed and sent into oblivon, but this game is just...ARRGGGHHH! What happenend to everything it had? Without any Franchise Mode or 3-Point Shootouts (NBA Live 98), there is very little to do. Legendary teams and MJ and Bird makes up very little to this already disgustingly ruined game. If PS2 continues to make basketball games like these, I'd stick to PS1 instead because many basketball fans who owns a PS2 will be hurling objects at Sony and the insane EA headquarters."
3,"why ""is this game bad""?","I rented this game because I had a feeling it wouldn't be great. Turns out I was right. The graphics are good, however need improvement. Especially when you compare them to Madden. The gameplay through me off because it was awful. The controls don't react quick enough and that makes it really annoying. What really annoyed me with this game is the way players keep on bumping into each other and nothing happens (at least have a player fall down once and a while).This game is missing fast breaks (and I mean fast breaks like Iverson and Carter), quick steals, better passing (Jason Williams style), cleaner and more accurate graphics, and a franchise mode. The one on one mode is an excellent addition, but I would much rather consider a three on three or two on two."
2,NBA LIVE IS DEAD,I'VE BEEN A FAN SINCE THE ORGINALLY STARTED ON SEGA. THE OTHER PLAYSTATION LIVE GAMES WERE EXCITING AND FUN. THIS GAME HAS NO LIFE TO IT AT ALL. IT'S HARD TO GET A SHOT OFF IN THIS GAME AND AT TIMES WHEN U TRY TO RUNA FASTBREAK YOUR THE ONLY ONE RUNNING WHILE THE REST OF YOUR TEAM IS WALKING DOWN THE COURT. THERE IS NO MORE PRACTICE MODE TO WORK ON YOUR SKILLS OR THE 3-PT SHOOTING CONTEST TO WORK ON YOUR SHOT. HOPEFULLY THIS IS A 1 TIME ERROR BECAUSE IT'S THE 1ST GAME ON PS2. THE PS1 VERSION IS ALL THAT AND NBA2K1 ON DREAMCAST HAS THIS BEAT HANDS DOWN. SAVE YOUR MONEY ON LIVE AND WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR WHEN THEY WORK OUT THE KINKS.
2,Average game at best,"I hope NBA games get better because this is a disappointment. The game is just like PS1 counterpart, with slightly better graphics. I bought this game because I wanted a basketball game and that out of all the ones coming out, this is the better one. Why couldn't EA do the same for b-ball like they did for football & snowboard?"
5,"Oh man, is this guy funny!","serious; funny; --> seriously funny.so funny, i couldn't put it down.seriously."
5,Serious and Funny,Like M*A*S*H* this book finds humor and laughter even in the tragic. And every laugh serves a serious purpose.
3,Needs More Songs!,"This album is tight except there aren't enough songs! It needs A LOT more than just 8! Despite the number of songs on here, this album is pretty tight. The best songs are Be A Witness, Live By Yo Rep, and Tear Da Club Up. If you can find this album anywhere, buy it!"
1,Go back to grade school,"To the ""music fan"" from New Orleans: If you like Three 6 Mafia so much, learn how to spell their name correctly. It's Mafia, not ""Maifa"". You disrespect the whole Triple 6 crew by not correctly spelling their name. Go back to grade school, pal."
1,This garbage makes a better frisbee than a CD.,"If you think you bought a junky ablum, this one is worse! First of all, it only contains 8 tracks, one being an intro, and one being a crappy remix. Two of the remaining six tracks are only a minute long! That only leaves four tracks. On top of that, the production is redundant and grates on your ear, while the flows and lyrics and flows are boring enough to put a hype party to sleep. They even go as far as to dis Bone Thugs, which is a joke, considering the talent gap Bone has over Three 6. I will say that I like Three Six Mafia's newer material, but this older garbage shouldn't even be sold. Maybe it's a blessing that this CD is so short afterall."
5,Live By Yo Rep Cause I ain't takin Sh*t Bone Lay it down,"Back then Bone use to run they mouth.In the old Jet book Bone was talking about Memphis Tennessee and Three Six Mafia and Tommy Wright at the time was making dissin song about bone.So Dj Paul Juicy J came up with a ideal to make a whole cd talking about them. The Song Live By Yo Rep is the 2nd hardest song and # 1 song Triple Six Mafia song is hard.If you listen to it the song have two different people rappin at one time left speaker Dj paul and Left Speaker Juicy J. The Whole is Hard cause my man Koopsta on there,plus skinny pimp, playa fly ,gangsta boo,cruchy Blac and lord infamous. They came a long way from they tapes to Cds.The Real Kings of Crunk"
3,The CD that started it all...,"This CD is worth buying for anyone that knows whats up. The first three songs slam. This is not the best from three six but it has the tracks that started ripping through the underground propelling them to the top. Throw your sets in the Air is one of the best songs they've ever done. Tear the Club up is a classic. The weak points come in the Live by Yo Rep remixes. Anyone who says these guys cant flow is out of their mind. Nobody raps as fast or as brutal as Three Six. They make BONE look weak. BONE ripped the Memphis stylez anyway, made it commercial and pretends that three six is perpetrating. I dont think so. See for yourself. If I were starting over and wanted to try this group out, I would buy THE END. Its way better."
2,Who's Style?,"In 1991, Twista came out and got into Guinness, then in 1993 B.O.N.E. released Faces of Death and then the classic EP ""Creepin on ah come up"" in 1994. I honestly think Twista and other chitown rappers didnt steal Bone's style because even though theyre both fast, bone harmonizes their flow, while twista harshly spits his. This album is a clear cut example of how Three 6 Mafia used Bone's style to come up. This album was originally released in 1995 and each of the members of the group sound almost identical to the Bone members. If you want my opinion, Three 6 used Bone's style to come up in the business and that is evidenced through the fact that in Three 6 today. ""Stay Fly"" and ""Poppin My Collar"" sound nothing like ""Live By Yo Rep"", all being good songs. Look at that to comparison with Bone ,, ""East 1999"" and ""Thuggish Ruggish Bone"" sound very similar to Bone's appearances in ""Ridin"", ""Spit Yo Game"", ""Dont Forget About Us"", and their solo work."
3,For REAL Triple Six fans only,"Good, but they should have put more original songs on it though. I didn't really like it at first."
2,TOO SHORT TO BE CONSIDERED AN ALBUM.,"I like all of THREE-6 MAFIA'S projects except this one. It was too short and really only had three true songs on it. It was the only mistake that they made in releasing an album. TO THE PERSON ON THE BOTTOM, NICE OPTION, PAL, BUT HERE IS MINE. THREE-6 MAIFA CAN AND WILL TAKE BONE THUGS-N-HARMONY ANY TIME, ANY PLACE, AND ANYWHERE. When BONE first came out they were good gangsta rappers, but every since that E. 1999 ETERNAL sh-t, the harmony beats have to go."
2,"Sub-Par, and bad for Three 6","If you want good old Three 6 dont waste your time with this. Get Mystic Stylez, Then End, and ESPECIALLY CH.2 World Domination, that CD is tha ish."
2,*BORING*,"This is not what I expected. It is full of random ""sexual encounter"" stories. I guess I did not read the summary very well. I enjoy a novel and not short stories, I mean a couple of pages to a few more. I was disappointed in the book."
3,"Sometimes good, sometimes very good!","Let me first say the skill level of the instructor is very high. Overall a lot of good stuff, but you could drop the first fifteen minutes that cover basic ukemi - the title didn't give a hint about this waste of time. Another thing that bothered me was the title, it looks like the emphasis will be pressure points, but really the emphasis is jujitsu and only secondary are the pressure points. Don't get me wrong, the jujitsu is high quality and the integration of pressure points is very cool. I would of gone 4 stars if not for wasting my time with break falls."
5,Clever and delightful,"I'm a children's librarian, and I've read A LOT of Halloween books. Halloweena stands out for it's solid but quirky plot and the illustrations are wonderfully detailed. This is a great read aloud. My kids loved it"
4,"Great Racing, but no cops!! better cars than NFS 3","NFS 2 is a good game for the begginging NFS gamer. The cars are McLaren F1, Ford GT90, Ferrari F50, Italdesigh Cala, and a few others. The graphics are ok, but not very 3d realistic. Also, there is no fire when you hit other cars, but when you hit a van with a McLaren F1 at 231 mph, they'll go flying. also, the tracks are very boring, and you cant change the weather like in NFS 3. very good cars, that go there top speed, unlike NFS 3. I highly reccommend it."
4,"Good game, but......","The game tries to add new cars and tracks to the original NFS II. Like the original it only supports IPX lan, and it will not run on an NT system. (Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista). The game adds cars and two tracks, (one bonus) at the cost of stability. For fun gameplay, turn wild mode off and set to arcade or sim."
3,Great! With a few set backs...,"This game is really fun. I was a little disappointed when I got it, because I thought it was the one with the new graphics AND freegame play, but turns out I picked the wrong one.It's still fun all the same though. Though you CAN'T pick your castles, or your heroes, and if one of your particular heroes dies you get a game over, but it's okay.It gives you a lot of challenging scenerios, and I still haven't beaten the game yet. It's hours and hours of gameplay, so don't take all the negatives I've said without realizing it's a great game overall."
1,A big disapointment and waste of a good idea.,"Well, ths could have been a great deal of fun - but it is not! The idea of making a campaign, where you are to travel through the elemental planes was obvious after the modifications of the Shadow of Death edition, and I was very excited when I saw this. Unfortunately, these scenarios are so easy that you could probably walk through it all in an afternoon - if you wanted. You get all the good spells in the first scenarios, and the enemy never gets an army big or good enough to make up for your tremendous advantages. And so, all it ends up to in the final scenario is getting past 'lots' of level 7 creatures to crush the enemy. The game is full of 'funny' remarks, that are only anoying, and the attempt to make the characters come to life has totally failed.Deffenitely NOT worth the money!"
1,Misleading description,"Write up states one left and one right remote turn-outs. In reality, they are both 'MANUAL' turn-outs. I am returning this product."
1,Awful zombie movie,"One of the worst zombie movies i have seen, the acting y totally terrible, poor plot, apathetic characters, please don't waste your money on this piece of ..."
2,Really dull,"I'll watch almost any zombie movie, but this one is tough to sit through. It's basically a kid's voice over while we watch images of a little girl wandering through damaged buildings and trash strewn streets. I was bored in the first 10 minutes and it just kept going and going. There's a plot twist about some special kids being immune to the infection and soldiers hunting them down, but you won't care much. And a cigar to anybody who can figure out the last minute of the film. Don't even rent this stinker."
2,Another old game That didn't really run well...,Again another old game that didn't run well under Win xp. I did manage to get it running a few times with freezes and sluggish fps. Most of these older games ran under Glide and not Direct X. Problem the reason it didn't work.
4,The Perfect Racing Game,"Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit is surely one of the best games for PC. There are many cars to choose from, and if you don't like any car from the list, you can download a new one from the internet!The gameplay is really challenging, making this game highly addictive and fun. The graphics are pretty good, too. Yeah, they're not the best, but still good. The cars look extremely life-like.In this game you can race against a second human player. Another good feature is that you don't have to be the racer; you could be the police! You have your radar to detect speeding cars and can stop them with spike strips, roadblocks, and many other things.If you like challenging games, I think this is the game for you. You won't find a better one."
2,Bjoring Bjork,"I enjoy Bjork's music, and was looking forward to her new album. But listening to it left me thoroughly disappointed.All the songs are bjoring. What happened to the things I like to call ""melodlies"", Bjork? Must we listen to you sing verses that sound suspiciously like you are making them as you go along?After listening to this album, I had to listen to Post just to make me feel better."
3,Insinctive Icelandic Iguanas,"Vespertine, to me, is about solitude. Celebrated solitude that refreshes. It enables to face the music that life is - a lot of which is noise. Well, noise can sometimes have a rhythm. One needs a meditative mind to realize - hence everyone has their own little musical world, I'm sure - I'm sure because I hope so, or vice versa. Music is in the ear of the hearer - one's own inner sounds. Bjork went into a hidden place where she invites but is happy with herself. The songs on Vespertine are self-gratifying musical noises from that coccoon....as if her music is the ambience for a post-civilization world where reconstruction is done based on freedom from within. A mother earth that is generous enough for innocent instinct of all her babes.Bjork, is one such earthchild.Yahoo!!!!"
5,Uniquely Artistic,"There is not much out there with this sound. It is certainly true that Bjork has a sound that cannot be categorized, and that is what I look for in unique music. This was my first Bjork album, and purchased at the recommendation of Amazon customers (as are many of my recent acquisition).The album provides an electronically contrived sound with influences as diverse as anything I've heard. The vocals are haunting and, if not beautiful, intriguing. This is art, not commercial music."
5,BEYOND WORDS,"simply...................Bjork is a geniusUnison is what the world should feel and then listen tosimply...................id love to meet her, to say thankyou."
5,"Bjork keeps ""Vespertine"" in a hidden place.","Ever since her debut album, Bjork has expanded as an artist and in my opinion only gets better with each release. ""Vespertine"" is a very private, passionate, and reflective album. It is like an unedited look into Bjork's mind. Musically, it is very simple and low-key. There are no songs on this album you could dance to. It has downtempo grooves and well arranged strings that let the listener focus more on the lyrics and vocals than the music. This is the type of record that each time you listen to it, you discover something new and seems to get better and sticks in your psyche after your done listening to it. ""Vespertine"" proves that Bjork is as great a poet and singer as a musician. This new direction for Bjork is great and I hope she keeps trying to push the boundaries and make music with spirit and soul. Simply put, ""Vespertine"" is Bjork's second best album. First being ""Homogenic"" of course."
5,Bjork is wonderful,"Ive heard most of her work, and I like it all....she is alwaysdoing cool things either in her songs or what she wears to award shows (unlike joan rivers I liked the swan dress)And she makes really cool music videos too. Ive listened to this a bunch of times and I really like it. If you want to try something out of the ordinary try any of bjorks albums :) better than the ultra commercial bands around right now, you wont hear any of this music being used in a coca-cola commercial hehehe...at least not the words....."
5,i love her...i love her!,"I was skeptical to hear this album, because to me Homogenic is almost too-perfect of an album. I didn't think even Bjork herself would be able to top it. And at first listen, I didn't think I'd like Vespertine. But it kind of sunk into my head, and I am slowly falling in love with this album. There are a couple of songs which stand out to me: Paegan Poetry, Its Not Up To You, Unison. But I think this album works as an antire being, the whole thing being very floaty and filled with great samples (rice krispies...who would have thought?!) and ambiant beats. To me this album respresents maturity. Its intersting to see how her music has evolved from Debut to this. Also on this album she uses her voice much more than I've ever heard, hitting delicate high notes in Aurora. This is Bjork at her most beautiful and finest."
4,I'm Slightly Disappointed,"As much as I love Bjork, and all of her cd's, I have only one little disappointment about this cd that keeps me from giving it 5 stars. One song that was -going- to be on this album, entitled 'Our Hands,' isn't on the album, and it's one of the best Bjork songs I've ever heard. It once again has a dancing heart, and great lyrics. Otherwise, great cd. Just please Bjork, release it as a single...or something?"
2,What went wrong here????,"I get the impression after listening to this that people like it just for being Bjork. These same people used to listen to the old stuff, like The Debut"" much more intently. I really liked Bjorks' early work. After listening to all the clanking and clanging of this rhythm-less release, I am confident that the she has become bored. This is not fun to listen to, and often gets down right annoying. Whats so wrong with making strange music that still has a rhythm to it??"
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars.,"Bjork is quite frankly weird, but her weirdness has always produced great songs. ""Vespertine"" definitely lives up to its meaning, and if it doesn't give you sweet dreams you've got problems. Don't expect the phat beats she served on ""Alarm Call"" or the electronica of ""Hyperballad"". This LP is mostly mellow. I'm very disappointed that ""Sweet intuition"" isn't apart of the US release. You've got to download that."
3,her long awaited new album,"If you are looking for fast tempo, techno, club songs like on her previous albums. This might not be the album you are looking for. Her new album leans to the slower ballad side of Bjork."
2,Utter Dissapointment...and did I mention I was disappointed?,"Usually I am major Bjork fan and have loved all of her solo work from Debut through Homogenic. However, with Vespertine I felt Bjork put out a real snoozer of an album. The entire album is way too subtle and quiet. I missed her signature wail and thumping beats on Vespertine. Not to mention that when the CD was delivered, it was defective and I had to send it back. Although I think the defective noises on the CD probably made it sound better. I recognize that there are people out there who love this CD, but to me, it was boring. I hope she comes back with her next album. N"
2,Isn't Vespertine the name of a tranquilizer?,"So I'm a fool.It was OK that I pre-ordered this recording before it was released, on the strength of my intense love affair with all of Bjork's previous offerings. But Vespertine was a shocking disappointment and I promptly misplaced the CD. Here it is months later and I simply cannot believe that this amazing artist can make a collection of songs so absent of genius, beauty, drama, spark, life...as Vespertine appears to be.So I have just ordered another copy. Someone please help me!I only hope that I can return to this forum in six months and say ooh, that Vespertine!, finally, I get it, my favorite Bjork, etc., etc. But somehow I really doubt it. Bjork, did you finally lay an egg? Break my heart!"
4,Definetly Her Best,"Vespertine, is in my opinion Bjorks best album to date. Im not sure if its because i have waited so long, or its due to the fact that its a Fantastic album. My favourite tracks on the album are Hidden Place (first single release), Undo, Sun In My Mouth and Harm Of WIll. Bjork has well and truly cemented herself as one of the most creative people in the music business and she can only be comended for it"
4,Erotic Lullaby,"Björk's Vespertine is an erotic lullaby. On her latest CD, the Icelandic chanteuse is quieter and more penetrating than ever. Built on simple electronic foundations - bleeps, blips, squiggles - these songs are overlaid by music box, electric harp, and a smearing of choral harmonics. No stranger to joy, the hushed settings cradle Björk's most celebratory music yet. Her vocals are passionate yet more controlled than in the past. Overheard in the wrong mood, Vespertine's precocity is like nails on a chalkboard. Semi-conscious, though (early morning, barely awake, or right before bedtime when fully relaxed), these songs are enchanting."
5,Simply ....A Masterpiece!,Vespertine is a work of art! It is truly an epiphany to my ears. Bjork's unusual/distinctive vocals accompanied by soaring orchestral movements and persussion instruments leaves me in awe. This CD is lovely magic; I could listen to it over and over all day long!
4,Soundscape Scientist,"This engimatic singer/song-writer has always defied easy classification and as a result, many have been put off by her quirky style of electronica/trip-hop/dance/pop (yes, pop). But where people are baffled, I've always found fascination. And Vespertine is definitely a gold-mine of fascinating and left-of-centre musical ideas. Here, the Icelandic native delves into the privacy of her soul, exploring themes of dreams, romance and intimacy, all packaged in poetic and cryptic lyrics and wrapped in a contemplative and explorative musical idiom. Listen to 'Hidden Place' or 'Cocoon' and you'll experience the idea of romance from a completely new perspective. Pure genius from a musical mad-scientist."
5,Such an indulgence to my ears.,"Bjork has always been a favorite of mine though I never paid much attention to her earlier, just the singles and some songs friends told to me. I recently bought Vespertine after reading excellent reviews on the album, and I couldn't agree more. Each song is so original and illumnitaes through the album with its very own sound. My two favorite songs that I can never stop listening to are, ""Pagan Poetry"", and ""Hidden Place"". This album is so original and Bjork's voice gives me the chills with her icelandic chill sending tingles down my spine. Each track is so carecully composed with electronic sounds like never before. I will definitly look out for Bjork's future works. I would give this 6 stars if I could."
5,Unbelievable!,"An incredible soundscape! Recording is close-miked to createan intimate *room* for the listener. And what the listenerhears is the sort of electronic/space music youmight get on your public radio stations late at night,but the production and attention to detail is so evidentalong with genuine artistic conviction, that the album willappeal to a wider audience, I'm sure.Bjork's soulful singing, the quality of the writing, and theexcellent musicians playing on this album will appeal to all."
4,Another great album,"I was happily surprised when I listened to this album. I appreciated Bjork's style in this album and it reminded me of her early work, which I like better."
1,Just plain horrible...,"Rolling Stone mag listed this on their top 50 coolest albums so out of curiosity I picked it up. BIG MISTAKE! It HAD to be a practical joke! Imagine a brain damaged cat walking across an out-of-tune synthesizer keyboard accompanied by lyrics randomly created by a computer. That's this album. Don't bother getting it unless you either enjoy listening to psychiatric patients or smoke crack cocaine (and I mean a LOT of it). Heck, if you lived near me, I'd GIVE this acoustic nightmare away. DAMN, even traffic noise sounds better than this. Excuse me, but I need to gouge out my eardrums now."
2,"Maudlin, boring and repetitive","This CD creeps along at such a maudlin pace that it's unbearable to listen to. Each of the songs are programmed pieces which feature a set beat (on a beat box) and a strange kind of tinkly synthesiser. Bjork's vocals scratch instead of sooth ala her previous work, and most of the time the songs are not really distinguishable from the last. 'Hidden Place' and 'It's Not Up to You' are promising, but the rest is just a discordant melange of sounds rather than music. If you liked the warped reverie of Radiohead's ambitious and decidedly similar 'Kid A' then you'll probably like 'Vespertine' - if not, then you'll be wasting your money and wasting your time. It's a total snoozer."
1,Boy oh Boy...,"Ive always loved Bjork and everything shes about, but this has to be the worst cd Ive ever heard of hers. It seems to have little direction and although I enjoy deep, dark depressing tunes, I would'nt listen to this cd unless I was actually killing myself. But again, that might just be me. Her other cds rock the casbah, this one doesn't! Hope you find some enjoyment out of it...."
1,How such a good music can be destroyed by such a bad sound !,"I heard the CD version. Its sound awfully like over-compressed FM radios. Over-powered basses, distorded trebles. Sound ""too much near from speakers"". As if Bjork sang thru a metallic tube, or shouts at our ears.Is it volontary ? Does the music company think that the listeners are so accutsomed with bad FM-radio sound that it does even kwnows what is true hi-fi ? Or is it a plot to have our ears accustomed to the bad quality 48MHz DVD-audio ?It is worrysome, because this is not the first record that is recorded like that."
2,Bjork ---Vespertine,"Maybe I'm not as patient as I could be be but what is the big deal with this artist? Hidden Place is one of the strangest and most irritating tracks I've heard in a long time. I don't care how pleasant and haunting the background music is. Byork (What's up with that name ---is this her real name or some weak attempt to be a Jewel or Maddonna) is boring and sounds like she's over-medicated most of the time. And what's with the baby-like voice style. I give her 2 stars, and only because her accompanyment has talent. There are too many great female artists right now for me to waste my time."
1,Bjork can't sing to save her life,"It's as simple as this: Bjork can't sing. I am not at all against quiet, introspective music like on this album, but she just can't pull it off. Her voice is awful, making everything fall flat on its face. Why almost everyone started believing she actually *has* singing talent is probably more due to good marketing than anything else."
1,Where are the hits.,Whats the deal with this ALbum. It has no radio friendly songs at all. Bjork used to be somone who was allways on tv and stuff but no more. If she continues with this she will end up selling no albums at all. I know Bjork may not think about that as much as Jennifer Lopez but i know that she still cares about her fame.
3,Exellent sound from SACD layer but distorded sound from Cd layer.,"SACD layer sound quality is amazing! but the CD layer (hybrid) is not as good as the old 16 bit 44.1 cd version. Maybe the digital down-converting super bit maping direct for cd layer was not used for down sampling to the CD version, or the record level is set to loud and clipping are noticable. The CD sound is close to an old vinyl with clicks and pops!On a hybrid SACD the CD layer is suppose to sound little better than the old CD version...5 star for the SACD layer.1 star for the CD layer.Only SACD version is useful in that case."
